Hi many asked for proof didn't i posted you a address with proof off funds?
Hi many ask me some question i try to be short in my answers so some are copy paste answer correct. my bad if it made you feel not respected.
I try not to post many public keys so i post only one which hold 250Btc..from there on you can reverse engineer and take a wild guess about the proof off funds.. the 250btc can and will cover the reward.
Please send me a private message. again i appreciate the effort you are taking. No need to doubt proof off the funds or my intentions.
@_date: 2019-10-07 09:11:49
you sure ???
@_date: 2019-10-10 13:55:05
I gave a 58Btc address
my bad ill pm you a 250 one
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:22:35
ill be back within 10 days
@_date: 2019-10-11 10:09:30
I can understand you have your doubts, why ask me for one off my address with funds, and when provided still doubt about it?
i can show you 3 more on the same day but why , you could say "OP found a cluster an posted these pub-keys, does not proof he is the owner"
Why would i go thru all the hassle make up a story and keep it for 3 years ?
Just for trolling ?
I need help finding the pw and i am willing to pay for the good result thats all, No need to question my intentions over and over again.
Just quit if your doubts are bigger than your believe in my story.

Hi there i see the chat request,

@_date: 2019-09-18 13:44:58
It was a paper wallet i remember partial of the pw . i only hold the encrypted priv-keys.
You can think what ever you want this isn't a scam.
You are assuming... why calling me out for a scammer or retared whit 0 backed proof.
when the pw is found i offer you a 10K in btc to place a tattoo on your skin 
"assumption is the mother off all fuckups"
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:27:18
You find this bullshit ?
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:00:44
You keep putting effort in typing assumptions.
while i keep searching for the pw.
you would dream to hold one off these private keys with partials pw.
Have a nice day:-)
@_date: 2019-09-18 10:07:13
i have a empty address which holds zero funds but uses the same pw ass a other address which hold funds.
so testing/breaking/finding the pass would not harm my other prove address

i don't want the too much info be found by google regarding the funds or adresses related to the funds
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:03:23
Because i provided a empty btc address  wich holds the same pw as the other address which hold funds.
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:43:49
Serious ??
Why would i do that ??
You are assuming! if you're not interested in helping, just don't waste time typing here assumptions.

@_date: 2019-09-18 16:00:50
Please read the posts this 1124jx is the beginning of the public key :-D not the beginning of the pw.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:22:03

@_date: 2019-09-18 13:04:00
The priv is empty i can post a address in private to show which hold funds and one can see the time the coins are transferred.
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:34:46
Hi there !
I first wrote down the password with a pen. I then typed it on a screen by looking at the piece of paper.
I even remembered it for 24 hours or longer. Because i  tried to learn it,but at some point i experienced a stressful situation  and lost the password written on a piece off paper.About a week after i tried to learn it. i am missing very little but very little can be a lot now. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:05:08
i can prove i am worth the money thats all
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:59:58
If you found this one you are in the money zone.
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:54:29
Hi English isn't my best language,
so the grammar wil mess you up when reading.
i guess 80% is correct for the middle part.
First letter after the numbers 211 is capital.
I am going under hypnosis next week to see if i can recover some.
I made up this stupid story to remind me of the passphrase.
Only i can't put the middle part correct.
translated : 211 gnomes swimming lane ten and go to the third steps up
"211 kabouters zwemen baan tien en gaan bij het derde trapje omhoog"
I know for sure 211 is correct and gnomes Kabouters are related to the number 100% i  could used the first letter also for the beginning ''K''
Difficult part is swimming lane ten "zwemmen baan tien it could also swimming ten lanes as zwemmen tien baantjes
logic for me to use the first character after gnomes as a capital.
to explain what the gnomes are going to do  "Swim" if there where dancing i would use the D as capital 
i can't figure out why i remember: lanes,lane ten and go up
baantjes =lanes ten=tien  go up= en gaan 
en gaan could be used to make the story complete or to rememmeber  a selfmade word "baanten"
like "Baan" (t) [t: tien/ten] en [en: en gaan/and go]
''en gaan'' could also help remind  en gaan 3 keer (trap)hekje omhoog.
The stairs/ladder to come out the swimming pool is called in dutch ''trapje'' a # looks with a little bit of imagination as a ladder.
the 3 and # are correct could change place max but are correct characters
"211 kabouters zwemen baan tien en gaan bij het derde trapje omhoog"
Yes escrow is ok i don't know how to put escrow for multiple people i can prove i have the money to pay and i am serious.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:51:08
all the details i gave is all i have.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:01:52
Why should i provide the btc address ?
there are no coins in it 
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:11:58
Mister know it all you are on a ufo flying to high.
There is a serious amount lost for sure.
I don't care about jobs or else i care about the lost funds.
and as said before i have a zero balance encrypted private key with the same password.
i can show and prove i am capable to pay the 15 BTC easy.
you do not have  a clue who i am.
so keep flying high in your space ship and enjoy your trip.
This is for serious people who think they can solve it and take the cash.
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:28:52
no its a encrypted private key only

@_date: 2016-07-01 22:29:21
Many thanks for the replies.
The passphrase is used to generate multiple encrypted bip38 private key's.(  )
some have funds others have no funds.
The all have in common the same passphrase.
-I share a encrypted private key 
-I share estimated 95% of the pw
There is is little risk in sharing one empty address.
The 10K worth in btc is for the finder indeed it's a serious amount. 
No need to lower the bounty as price is shifting i win or lose around 10K daily.
Guess if i am wrong and pw is around 75% accurate, i still need people to continue getting the password.
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:12:26
Thanks for all the replies and PM's.
I will post neccesary details in 10 hours.
The address given is empty!
to prove i am able to pay i can shift coins from one address to a other address.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:52:24
As time past i was doubting if it was correct.
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:38:10
The address is empty zero balance never used.
If you get an address i can confirm if its the correct one.
giving up the address  i don't understand what difference it would make in relation to the PW
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:59:55
I dont understand what you mean,
Can you explain?
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:21:31

Hi there,
Thanks for the help.
When do you wanna start ?
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:58:17
sir i will transfer some coins from one wallet to a other to show i have the money.
If you do not believe me its not my problem.
the address is empty and never used zero balance as mentioned many times.
If this is about showing am capable of paying 15BTC there are many other ways for me to proof i am good for the money.
The 10K is just a fraction compared the amount locked away 
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:15:12

@_date: 2016-07-02 17:15:57
That's correct.

@_date: 2016-07-04 21:40:48
WOW 50K possibilities thats a lot.
I am doing some more brain training.
