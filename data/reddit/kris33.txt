Anyway, credit cards are instant from the customers POV (which is what matters in this kind of situation), easy (just put it into the reader and type the pin) and free (except for costs passed on from the business to the consumer).

Well, that's just a typical example of "American stupidity", not a problem with credit/debit cards in itself.
In Europe that issue is already solved by requiring use of a chip+pin instead of magnetic stripe. In America they've decided that the relatively small amount of credit card fraud/swiping doesn't warrant improving the security of the system.

You will unfortunately experience a lot of sites that block you for running non-exit nodes too. Discussions.apple.com is the one I'm bothered by the most (it's often a highly relevant search result for mac/OS X related searches), but I'm regularly denied access to a lot of other random sites too. 
It's nowhere near as bad as it would be running an exit node though, I tried that for a while, but Cloudflare and Google made it hellish. And that's just the experience of it without taking the legal risks into consideration at all.

I bought Bitcoin from MTGox in 2011 and transferred most of it out. However, in January I sensed that something was horribly wrong at MTGox, so I went through the week long process of resetting the two-factor authentication. I was really nervous about it, since they weren't exactly known for their responsiveness, but the process was actually completed and I were allowed to log it.
Thankfully I had just 0.008 Bitcoins remaining (much less than I though), but I transferred it out January 26th. A week or two later they closed bitcoin deposits completely.

Are you seriously saying that "the internet" (whoever that is) was forcing the owners of the last mile to sell access to their competitors despite it not being the most profitable option (monopolies are generally pretty awesome from the monopolist's point of view), but European customer protection laws prevented that from occurring until it was forced on them again by regulation? 
Honestly - that makes no sense at all.

Don't you agree that there are cases where a de-facto monopoly is necessary, like broadband providers, unless regulation forces competition? Regulation hasn't created the internet monopoly in the US where the customers are stuck with the providers they hate. It's, on the other hand, the basic reality that you simply can't create a separate last mile infrastructure for each ISP and still have competitive marketplace that has created that monopoly. Both having a separate last mile for each ISP and having a lot of competition at the same time isn't realistic at all, it becomes prohibitively expensive - just one is expensive enough.
In cases where changing ISP requires changing the last mile infrastructure (like in most cases for internet in the US today) then changing becomes prohibitively expensive, preventing competition and creating a lock-in effect.

Damn, this is super nice. 
However, please remove/replace the two text lines "VERIFY BALANCE AT" "BLOCKCHAIN.INFO" on the back side as soon as it is feasible (I realize you probably ordered a lot of metal plates with that text).
It just doesn't fit the rest of the product, it just cheapens it a lot (like if Apple added "Powered by OS X" stickers to their laptops) and is totally unnecessary. Blockchain.info likely won't be relevant forever either. If you can you should replace the top with the year of production and the bottom with the production number, but if you can't (since you might need the same text on all the plates order from your supplier) I would just leave it blank instead.

Sweet! In 13 hours we've more than doubled the total lifetime donations to the site! **We started at 1.02 BTC, at this moment we're at 2.09 BTC!**
Granted, it's just 1.07 BTC/~$435 shared to 380, but it's still several hundred dollars. It would of course be really cool to see substantially more (considering that Dogecoin fans casually spend ten thousands of dollars on trolling NASCAR or the Olympics), but this is still pretty great progress in such a short period of time. 
Most importantly it has undoubtedly made more people wanting to run their own Tor nodes and existing node owners to add themselves to OnionTip. 
It has clearly driven growth. Unfortunately I didn't remember to check the numbers of nodes at the start, but I clearly remember it being closer to 300 than to 400 (it's currently 380).
Keep up the great work guys. :D

I don't think so. The advantage with Tor is that the nodes can broadcast information about themselves, like their Nickname and Bitcoin address. 
With Bitcoin nodes the only thing you know are the IPs, so it would be harder to build a similar system for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-25 09:31:09
Cool, but that would require the nodes to either run a patched BitcoinCore version, get it implemented into the official core or to have them switch to something completely different. 
That seems really hard. Not impossible, but really really hard. Having a large pool ready to distributed by a certain date/number of nodes would help though.

Something else is already running on port 443 that prevents Tor from using it. That's very common, since 443 is the port that SSL/HTTPS uses by default.
You can run "netstat -lnp" to check what process is using port 443, but you'll likely want that process to keep running. To change the port that Tor uses you must change your torrc (Tor setting file). Find the ORPort line and change it from 443 to something else (9001 is a good commonly used option) and restart Tor.

.se, .sx, .su, .eu, .to are okay - that's atleast what a bunch of torrent sites use. 
Thepiratebay is still on .se while KickassTorrent is on .to - and they're HUGE targets for the MAFIAA.
For there to be any real risk of take down you need to do some seriously illegal shit like CP, drug sales etc. I would worry way more about the hosting. Use a dedicated server on something like OVH or Nforce, they don't care unless someone force them to act (everyone uses them for seedboxes, and they never do anything about it), AVOID shared hosting like the plague. VPS's are better, but still not as good as dedis. Cloudflare is a good way to protect the IP of your site, but be careful about always having backups so you can restore the site quickly if something happens.

In what way is it not? It's regulation that forces the owners of the lines to sell the capacity to competing ISPs, creating a ton of competition. In the US on the other hand the line owners have a monopoly on internet access on that line, preventing competition.
Line-sharing is a perfect example of where smart regulation creates a more real free market that increases the competition and innovation.

That's just a false dichotomy set up by you. There's good regulation and bad regulation, to pretend that regulation either is a good thing all the time or a bad thing all the time is just ignorant.
One example is Europe's regulations regarding ISPs, where the regulations force a much freer marker than in the US.

A global cashless society is coming, with or without Bitcoin.
It's not a question of cashless or not - it's a question of centralized and controlled cashlessness (like we are starting to see in some western countries) or free and decentralized cashlessness (like what Bitcoin provides).

No, you're confused. There were two stashes of Bitcoin seized when the Silk Road were shut down - a ~30,000 BTC stash on the Silk Road servers and a 144,336 BTC stash on Ross Ulbricht's computer. 
Since he obviously couldn't claim ownership to the Bitcoins on the Silk Road servers without admitting that he had something to do with the Silk Road he didn't file a claim of ownership (and nobody else did either). Because the 30,000 BTC therefore was unclaimed this auction could take place.
He did on the other hand claim ownership of the 144,336 BTC stash on his own computer, so they'll stay untouched until he is either found guilty or not.

It's weird of you to point to my ideology, which is one where there such a thing as good regulation and such a thing as bad regulation, as a debate tactic to paint me as the unreasonable one...
The early internet was for the most part, controlled by governments and education organizations like universities. Thankfully business was allowed access, which resulted in the extremely innovative internet we have today. 
The early internet was accessed through the existing telephone network, so it is totally absurd to claim that access to it was unregulated (if we're talking about the US:  At that time ISPs didn't provide direct internet access (for the most part), they just sent back the internet to whoever called them up through their modem.
With broadband however there's no middleman (like the telephone network was) that let you chose whatever ISP you want. With broadband you have a direct connection all the way from your house to the ISP that somehow was chosen (often through legislation/lock-in-offers) to get access to your house. Unless something (in this case regulation) forces the owners of the connection to your house to compete with others they'll be the only choice you have.

Yeah, I would go for a Trezor + safety deposit box for the seed too.
However, DON'T USE the recovery seed booklet that comes with the Trezor. Weird things happen and safety deposit boxes sometimes do get opened/robbed.
The booklet is unfortunately way too "obvious". Anyone who steals it will Google it due to curiosity and quickly discover what it is and how the money "on it" can be stolen. They don't have to know anything at all about Bitcoin at all, the front page of the booklet gives them all the hints they need, "Trezor - The Bitcoin Safe - Recovery Seed" is printed on the front page of the booklet...
I would certainly obfuscate the seed it some way. Maybe by printing out a few pages of an important looking document (of the kind people would keep in safety deposit boxes, like testaments) with the seed mixed in a systematic pattern. It doesn't have to be hard to discover the pattern at all, it just has to be hidden enough so that bank robbers looking at it for just a few seconds will disregard it as worthless documents.

Honestly - there's no reason to use Bitcoin directly (without middle-men like BitPay) in those kinds of PoS situations yet. The fee for the credit card processing has to be paid by the business, and it's much easier for them to just include it in the prices of their products instead of charging it as an extra while paying. 
Therefore there's nothing to save by paying with Bitcoin directly, it's just a lot of hassle.
Bitcoin directly on the blockchain will likely be too slow to ever gain mass-market use due to the slow confirmation times. For situations like this a middleman, like BitPay, is really needed for it to be practical to use Bitcoin.

Europe is, from a regulatory standpoint, still far away from being a group of united states with a common federal law like the USA, even though the EU has simplified things in a lot of ways. Each country here has a lot of different regulations and laws that Coinbase needs to follow, that's why they must do it country by country.

It's not really about skin color, it's about demographics. 
Why certain groups of the population use Bitcoin and other groups don't is an extremely relevant question to ask. Unless we cater to the other demographical subsets, the people with other interests and needs than just us, Bitcoin won't grow as it could have otherwise done.

Two things:
1. The average salary is definitely way higher than 50K. It's probably closer to a 100K than 50K.
2. An employee costs way more than just their salary. It's hard to say, but a 80K salary developer may easily end up costing the company 100K each year.

I'm not sure if this was intended as a joke or not.
This would just hurt all the other miners who can't use either the overt or the covert forms of ASICBoost, due to how their ASICs were designed or because of patents.

@_date: 2017-04-07 23:59:17
No doubt, usage of ASICBoost hurts the miners who aren't using it. 
Switching from the covert form to the overt form, like is proposed here, would do nothing to solve that issue. ASICBoost needs to be patched away/removed for the mining playing field to be fair.
This would be a bad solution even if all ASICBoost patents disappeared tomorrow though, as BitMain would be able to exploit their current ASICs and get an unfair competitive advantage for a while, while all the others would have to invest heavily in ASICs which exploits the overt ASICBoost bug to be competitive.
@_date: 2017-04-07 23:35:29
Because the miners with an ability to use ASICBoost would get a significant competitive advantage over the ones without that ability.
