Hey, thanks for the advice.  I'll be moving to more and more secure wallets as I invest more.  I forgot to mention that I did not dump my life savings in, just more than I've ever invested in a single instrument before.  I'll be continuing to invest, as time and trends dictate.

Hey, thanks for speaking up.  I don't know what the future holds, but once I decided to invest, I did not go all-in at once.  I just invested more than I've ever been comfortable with at one time.  Like you, I plan to follow that up, though. I think when one has the long view, one can buy well during dips, which I plan to do with follow-on investments.

Hey, thanks for the links and tips.  I understand ETH a bit more now, and will be learning more about it as I keep a closer eye on this space.

Nice!  Thanks for sharing.

Hey, thanks.  I have the same take on things.  The more it dips, the better.  I plan on buying on the way down, and holding on the way up, until I wish to skim a bit of profit from time-to-time.

Good point.  I'm actually shocked our financial system has remained as stable as it has.  Just a few mild global depressions, recessions, and crises.  I think we just need to be looking closely at the long-term risk in current ownership of bitcoins as we move forward.
I'm sure someone has done the math to figure out what the value of each Bitcoin would be if the world accepted it as the de-facto global currency.  That means all the measurable assets in the world are spread across 21M coins.
Is my logic sound, or am I missing something?

Full disclosure, I'm not female.  I just try to use gender-random language whenever I'm thinking about it.  It's just my tiny way of attempting to foster a gender-neutral bias.

You are not the first person to point that out.  I'll clarify with an edit to my post.  Net:  I did not invest my kibble money.  I just invested more than I have ever before in a single instrument.  I'll be following it up  with further investment as the market dictates.

Hey, thanks for the tips.  I'll be watching the upcomming events with interest, and I'll have a look at r/btc.

I know, sounds pretentious the way I put it.  I guess I should have said: "Get an overview of how the global economy works."  I'm just glad to be here.  : )

You are right to point that out, as others have.  I added a footnote to my post.  I did not invest more than I can afford to lose.  In fact, I plan on continuing to invest as the market dictates.

Good point.  I can see needing to spend alot of coin in the early days to operate.  An economist could have a field day thinking about that.
