this is a scam attempt 'cause they can ask for documents after signup.
q: why they do not work this way? a: 'cause it isn't profitable.
@_date: 2012-11-29 19:20:45
potential investor only enter where money is free to leave.
Mtgox deserved scam label because once your money is there it is finished. it is not free to leave anymore.
@_date: 2012-11-29 18:51:21
you are wrong. a real legit bank ask for documents BEFORE not AFTER receive your money. who make excuses AFTER receive your money is called SCAMMER not bank.

If you plan to use MTGOX with Tor **WARNING** NEVER USE MTGOX they are scamming newbies and people from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Venezuela, Cuba, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, etc.
@_date: 2012-11-29 18:40:54
are you a gox paid poster? get a live. mtgox is not perfect.
bad experience happens all the time. lets others disclose their bad experience.
bitcoin is all about freedom not about be goxed.
@_date: 2012-12-05 18:00:32
No matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter a majority of redditors tell you, no matter what. NEVER USE MTGOX. They will try any excuse to separate you from your bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-11-29 16:54:42
1. create a site
2. accept bitcoin
3. block user account
4. gox user
5. ???
6. profit!
what a legit business.
@_date: 2012-12-05 18:23:20
Su***r. Mtgox is unsafe. This is fact. You are trying to help mtgox.com to profit a little more. Don't hide this.
@_date: 2012-11-24 01:32:13
No it not save to use mtgox. Trust no one to hold your Bitcoins. MtGox is so old-fashioned. They are so 2008. They are for bitcoin today what omnpay was to defunct e-gold. Do you want bitcoin to be the next defunct? Continue sending your hard earned bitcoins to Mttoxic.
@_date: 2012-11-24 12:49:17
No he is not a noob. I think he is a good guy. He is a bitcoiner that thinks like a non bitcoiner. He understand the risk but he is too lazy to do it himself. Mtgox is toxic to bitcoin. This is fact. He understand it. Mtgox has nothing to do to bitcoin but money. He understand it too. What he do not want to tell you is that once the chaos hit Mtgox none is safe.
@_date: 2012-11-24 14:27:32
Thank you to make me understand that mtgox 2011 hacker fiasco was in fact an improvement. It helps bitcoin a lot. I'm feeling more comfortable now than before.

Today all bitcoins exchangers are old-fashioned. They work like omnpay used to work in 2008. Today e-gold is a defunct. Those who use mtgox and similar sites are helping bitcoin to become the next defunct. You risk to loose your bitcoins and your money if you continue to use those exchangers because unlike bitcoin, mtgox do block accounts. Unlike Bitcoins, mtgox accounts are hacked. Unlike bitcoins, mtgox can separate you from your money. 
Use localbitcoin.com. Do it yourself. Make the rules. Trust no one. Or wait until the next generation of bitcoin exchangers to be developed.
@_date: 2012-11-29 15:42:38
again? what mtgox is doing with those blocked bitcoins? 
if they are not sending donations to Red Cross I call mtgox a get rich kick scheme.

shame on you you are a bitcoiner.
bitcoin is about freedom. do us a favor, use your knowledge to create a new generation P2P exchanger. don't be a comfortable programmer who believe in the old way to do business, unless you are another mtgox paid poster.
@_date: 2012-12-02 18:48:22
**NEWBIE WARNING**: NEVER USE MTGOX they are scamming newbies and people from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Venezuela, Cuba, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, etc.
@_date: 2012-11-24 02:26:13
Never. They don't like to have their names linked to "hacker", "hacking" tags. You wont see a banker blogging like this  You will never see a banker coding php.
@_date: 2012-12-03 02:42:35
**SCAM WARNING:** NEVER use mtgox. They will separate your nephew from his bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-11-29 17:33:28
it is profitable to scam newbie's bitcoin. they will not make any refund. this is the way their legit scam business work.
@_date: 2012-11-24 13:12:42
After read it I feel comfortable that hackers are doing most of the bitcoins trades.
@_date: 2012-11-29 22:46:16
yes, because we like P2P software. we don't need centralized old-fashioned sites. mtgox is so old-fashioned. it is 1990-2008 business model. things that worked at this time do not work anymore. google omnipay, e-gold, e-bullion, etc. mtgox work in the same dangerous way.
bitcoin is freedom. mtgox is a bitcoin trap.
@_date: 2012-11-24 13:59:24
Protect yourself. There are no warranty they will do it again when another hacker history popup.
@_date: 2012-11-30 00:11:10
this link has no solution
the solution is:
* ask for documents after registration, before receive any funds
* do not display any bitcoin address for deposit
they wont do it because it is not profitable.
@_date: 2012-11-24 01:44:51
Do you really believe they wont be hacked again? Do you really believe fincen will protect you when MagicalBUX, or their partners, or a disgusting employer sell your data on the black market? Trust no one. MtGox is unsafe, old-fashioned and dangerous for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-30 19:40:32
**SCAM WARNING: Iranians NEVER touch mtgox site. They will separate you from your bitcoins.**
@_date: 2012-11-29 22:24:05
we are not talking about "me" we are talking about newbies using this service. I won't use this scam. I understand the way gox planned to milk bitcoin newbies.
@_date: 2012-11-29 20:14:31
have you sent any documents to reddit? no? sorry we can't identify you.
oh... ok. like reddit, gox only need username or email to identify user... unless they are idiots who never used sql.
@_date: 2012-12-05 17:46:46
**WARNING SCAM TACTICS DETECTED** The true is that mtgox.com is trying to separate you from your bitcoins. 
No matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse. Never send your bitcoins to this predator. Never send any information to this site. Your bitcoin is safe with you but it is not safe with them.
@_date: 2012-11-24 03:55:04
You know nothing about marketing. I agree banks days are numbered. Mttoxic will fall like omnpay before you see banks out of business. People like you and mtToxic are dangerous for Bitcoin future. You think like a noob trusting someone else will take care of your money. Do you have a brain? Do it yourself. Trust no one.
@_date: 2012-12-05 18:12:07
Again? Mtgox is unsafe. Try to use OTC sites.
@_date: 2012-11-24 13:36:01
Never send any information. Their business model is evil. I believe you sent money or bitcoins to them now they are asking for papers to send your money back. You have been goxed, scammed. This is the way their business model works. It is very profitable.
@_date: 2012-12-05 17:35:06
said the bitcoin scammer.
@_date: 2012-11-24 01:20:20
While bitcoin is pseudonymous Mtgox is linking your ID with your coins. They are also data-mining the blockchain. Mtgox is the most dangerous Bitcoin business ever. p.s. The owner is a hacker.  - What more to say?
@_date: 2012-11-24 14:11:29
you hate banks but you hold a bank account. wrong place to ask. don't ask google, ask your bank what a hacker is.
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:37:36
no, bitcoin don't need gox. gox needs bitcoin. gox is milking newbies and the network. they are a planned scam site.
who use this scam site? me? never, but you! you deserve to suffer the next hacker event. I will never touch it because I understand the way this planned scam works.
get a live paid poster. bitcoin is not for people like you. bitcoin was developed for freedom. to protect people from lockers like gox. do you like to be goxed? use paypal and gox sites.
