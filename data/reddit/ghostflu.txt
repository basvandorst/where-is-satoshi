im going to cash the money after i sold my bitcoins todays. the rest of the coins are on coinbase. just wanted to make sure that my money on gdax is safe if something were to occur

correct, im expecting a correction sometime soon. i was reading heavily into it and didnt want to get greedy. im happy with my sale and knowing that the initial money i put in can be recoup at this point. i believe heavily in bitcoins but wanted to be on the safe side with my investment.

i was getting a little nervous with the price increase and having it sink. i put a decent amount of my savings which luckily resulted in a profit and wanted to recoup my initial investment which i did. whatever i have on coinbase in bitcoin is pure profit at this moment so i wll continue to hold that until the future.

literally me, my initial investment double sold when the price was at 17000 and whatever is left can rise or fall without me having to panic. i feel at at peace not that i still have free money i can play with without consequence.

im buying more after the correction and holding steadily

i honestly took a gamble when i purchase at 7900 a coin but i took the risk knowing what could happen if the price were to sink at that moment. but im in the blue now which is great. i can play around with the rest of the coins if need be without worrying.

literally me, purchased at 7900 and sold half to recoup my initial investment at 17000 today. feeling safe right now and the rest of the bitcoin are on coinbase at the moment so when it does dip ill transfer some to gdax and purchase the dip then hodl. if it shoots up so be it but thats not a risk i was willing to take after doing some research due to the influx in pricing right now.

"In 2003, the ten double eagles were stored at the United States Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky. They were shown to jurors in Philadelphia during the July 2011 trial, but were then returned to Fort Knox, where they were to remain until a decision was made regarding their disposition.[13] In April 2015, a United States federal appeals court ordered the coins returned to the Langbord family because the original asset seizure was conducted improperly, as the government failed to file a judicial civil forfeiture complaint within 90 days of the family's seized asset claim.[14] This order was reversed on July 28, 2015, and in October 2015, an en banc session was held with 13 judges from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where they heard oral arguments in the ongoing appeal. On August 1, 2016, the judges reversed the previous ruling, finding the coins to be property of the United States government.[15] The Langbords appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on April 17, 2017 denied certiorari."
