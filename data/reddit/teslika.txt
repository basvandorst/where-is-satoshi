Perhaps the site is not yet fully parsing all transactions and or tagging many as unknown. 
For instance the assets tab shows the last counterparty transactions as being 2 years ago, when it was really 25 minutes ago, and there are tens of thousands missing.
Great service however. Tons of potential here

Excited to follow this project!
Blockchain based gaming is in a nascent stage right now, but something I think is really going to kickstart the tokenization concept and drive users to adopt bitcoin for other purposes than simply speculation of a commodity
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:06:35
Based on my experience it was a failure due to SWARMs implementation and a few high profile complainers who had ideological concerns with "blockchain spam", rather than any real technological limitations with blockchain voting (which were also existing with other technologies such as helios) 
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:55:49
it is not tied to a single ledger/technology. IE should ripple emerge as the dominant issuance/contracting platform over bitcoin, (god forbid!) focus would migrate there.
Since this is such an early stage, Byrne is hedging his bets, or sitting on the fence, whatever you want to call it. Plenty of cryptofinance outfits are doing the same, regardless of whether they are platform agnostic or not, or whether they have even demoed a project they do love to use that line.
These statements to an extent are untrue, because the concepts behind Bitcoin based blockchain settlement is so massively different to say, ripple based settlement, there's no way you can truly say that they translates across 1:1. You can never directly "seize" an asset on the bitcoin blockchain for instance (it would have to be done a level above that) whereas you can seize or freeze ripple assets. Whilst the issuance may be agnostic, you end up with a solution with totally different properties. It's like saying you could issue an asset (and handle subsequent trading) on the blockchain or on craigslist completely agnostically when in reality they are two completely far removed concepts

Not sure if you guys are trying to be politically correct inferring that no, women actually hate anything simple and cute and how dare I suggest such a thing. 
"it's not geeky, not overly complex and it's cute." That is the feedback echoed to me by a couple of girls, some of whom are in the camming industry.
That's all there is to my comment, a statement of positive reinforcement of that particular wallet compared to some other popular ones by girls I've introduced bitcoin wallets to.
I'm leaving it at that if this is going to begin a tedious argument about gender stereotypes.

It's not about efficiency- (as stated, a blockchain is far from ideal in that regards) It's about complete transparency &amp; guaranteed immutability.
On a similar vein; I'm researching blockchain applications for Access control and this is an idea which holds huge promise IMO.
Access tokens can be stored on the blockchain and this immediately removes the chance of any password compromise for my application. There is no centralised database with a hash of passwords, the user stores their own private key and uses that to unlock. There is only a finite amount of keys that I have issued, that will work on the "door"
This "door" could be a physical door or simply a secured section of a website that requires a blockchain key token.
Instead of thinking of these as keys, I can also use them as as coupons (which is similar to what Gyft has announced). Again, the same properties apply. I no longer keep a database of coupon codes or an algorithm which can be broken, you either have the coupon or you don't. To use the coupon you must destroy it. These coupons could represent something reedemable for a physical/digital good, a commodity, service or a discount.

I remember the bitcoin foundation already trialed blockchain voting. 
The vote was rescinded due to an unarguably poor implementation by swarm, and objection by a few users.
IIRC you were one of the voices against blockchain voting, one reason (as you mention above) was that you inferred voters could sell their votes.
However you cannot prevent bad-actors from outright selling off their rights to vote , or accepting money to vote for another candidate.It is still possible to sell helios votes, or helios credentials. You know that!! That is **not** a valid argument to be against blockchain based voting as it also exists in non blockchain based voting.
You can 'prove' a specific helios or share/sell credentials vote via shoulder surfing, screensharing, session sharing, SSL proofs etc.. they are what acts as evidence of a specific vote to a prospective co-ercer or vote buyer, just as it would be possible to outright "sell" or co-erce a specific vote with the vote token when the blockchain based voting was used (regardless of whether it was sent/sold to another bitcoin address or not). You cannot eliminate co-ercion with **any** voting mechanism.
What blockchain based voting DOES address. is transparency. In that regard The benefits are obvious. Helios is in the shadows, blockchain voting is for everyone to see. Last years bitcoin foundation election was, for a while, the only transparently auditable election we have ever had. 
"near perfect Miner censorship"  is a gross exaggeration. A miner cannot just redirect votes willy nilly, In the same way they cannot just redirect bitcoin payments willy nilly.  Even attempted censorship hardly leaves no trace. I know you know better than this.  I'd say some these are largely ideological concerns against "misusing" the blockchain, rather than any real specific technological limitations although you have tried to paint them as the latter.

In terms of usability; the easiest and most female friendly wallet for storing and sending BTC I have encountered is called Gems (
 
It is a direct Bitcoin wallet (no intermediary) and works a lot like giftrocket or snapchat's snapcash feature. 
I have no relation to the wallet, aside from having recommended a few bitcoin wallets to camgirls and found that they had an easier time using it compared to mycelium, airbitz, blockchain info etc.
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:19:43
Empowering the blockchain to enable trading of assets (migrating them from platform or game specific walled gardens) into a global ledger is a great idea IMO.
The fact you can trade these  rewards p2p between other users on the bitcoin blockchain in the same way as bitcoins themselves just makes it more appealing. You can enforce artificial scarcity and guarantee unforgeability, and the user has absolute control over the asset instead of a third party.
I think tokenization is going to take off in a big way, and introducing gamification elements are a great way to introduce a wide and loyal new userbase to bitcoin. (perhaps a userbase who would of never saw the appeal in using bitcoin before as a commodity or currency previously, because they already use CC's)
Game devs don't need to build a proprietary system by leveraging bitcoin infrastructure. I can imagine a day when you we can trade swords, rare cards, gems/game gold, spells, armor etc across many different games between users or even unlock brand new content- all ontop of *the* bitcoin blockchain

@_date: 2015-03-04 14:47:03
Verification would likely be to sending to a provably unspendable address.
I know it is possible to lock an asset at a fixed number. e.g create 1000 rare swords and their will never be more than 1000 able to be issued (that is secured by the same protection that ensures you can't roll back transactions on the blockchain)
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:02:41
Agreed.  but even if you did tie voters real life identity to a single allowed vote on a non-blockchain based system you cannot prevent bad-actors from outright selling off their rights to vote , or accepting money to vote for another candidate.

They have a few thousand BTC worth of precious metals purchased by clients stored in the blockchain: 
No idea why it's not more popular aside from lack of marketing. You can buy directly from them at 0.5% over spot and have tradeable precious metals stored in the blockchain. You can trade directly to other users p2p and that decentralized exchange can't be frozen or shutdown. Of course if you want to physically take receipt of the PM's you can also do that.

Well he is a religious nut, That wouldn't be incorrect.

It hinges on surreptitious censorship from someone in a senior position of power amongst the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:15:17
The argument is not really focused on his religion. That is a personal choice and not relevant to a technical discussion. That example could of been him inserting recipes into the blockchain. I would of used it in that case. He didn't insert recipes though, he inserted specific religious christian propaganda into the bitcoin blockchain, so I used that.
The actual argument here is It's that you don't see any core-devs using their maintainer powers to slip in patches filtering out religious content in the blockchain.  Luke-jr actually went full circle and inserted spam into the chain without consent of the users or regard for others,  while later deciding to surreptitiously filter out what *he* felt was spam on behalf of others (which included transfer of real value)

Surprise surprise, Luke-JR..the **for-profit** Blockstream co-~~founder~~ author/colored coins advocate (backed by $21 million wall st money) abuses his repo maintainer powers AGAIN to filter and weaken open source competitors like MasterCoin &amp; CounterParty...You also choose to filter betting sites on behalf of unwitting users. They all pay transaction fees.  This is heinous behavior.  Even after the last time you were called out months ago you snuck it in again. Use whatever blacklists you like. Do NOT force it upon others. Anyone can make their own conscious decision to filter these out if they do not wish to support decentralized exchange, smart contracts or people making bets between themselves on the network.
Here is just a sample of what Luke has embedded on the blockchain: (apparently this is not spam to him)
 &gt; n nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee and I detest all my sins....
...because of Thy just punishments, but most of all because they offend Thee, ...
...my God, who art all good and deserving of all my love.
I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more...
...and avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.
O my God! I firmly believe that Thou art one God in three Divine persons, ...
...Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; I believe that Thy Divine Son became man, ...
...and died for our sins, and that he will come to, judge the living and the dead.
I believe these and all the truths which the Holy Catholic Church teaches, ...
...because Thou hast revealed them, who canst neither deceive nor be deceived.

Sorry,  perhaps co-author/consultant would be more appropriate for his role in the venture. Co-founder was misreported afrom other sources, and I should of done more fact checking there. 
I mention Blockstream and colored coins since some of their functionality directly competes with Mastercoin/CounterParty. It seems the decision to blacklist these transactions are not without self-interest. It's quite common knowledge Luke and you generally are *strongly* against alt-coins or "bitcoin competitors" despite both MSC and CounterParty being fairly obviously complementary, tacking on features that aren't overtly present in bitcoin core. 
It makes me sick to know that there are poeple hard at work creating solutions like mastercoin and counterparty ON TOP of bitcoin- instead of creating a new ledger. They are attemping to add features like decentralized exchanges (after hundreds of millions, if not over a billion $ worth of cryptocurrency has already been stolen from centralised single point of failure over the past years causing immeasurable damage to the ecosystem and public perception)  One core developer who sees this as "spam" takes it upon himself to implement **sly** blacklists for these. Completely optional opt-in (with adequate non misleading/sensationalist explanation as to what such a patch does) is fine . Pushing such patches in a deceptive way is not okay.

CounterParty and XCP are seperate things. The CounterParty protocol requires usage of XCP in some cases.

I think the below serpent code for decentralized, provably fair lottery more of less fits your needs.
it is runnable on Bitcoin blockchain-  that's specifically what it was written for (via counterparty) or Ethereum blockchain. Only bitcoin is required to participate
It was written to fit the following specifications
    include a section for the instantiator of the contract (lottery) to take a fee
    it should be able to handle creating multiple "tickets"
    it should distribute the winning based on how many numbers people get X of Y numbers (similar to how state     lottos work)
    it should allow people to trade tickets
    it should allow users to redeem tickets
    it should set limits for when tickets can be redeemed
    if no one gets all the numbers the contract should roll over for another time period
    the initiator should be able to choose how many number fields, time block period, and his pay out, and possibly     the distribution logic (if you want to get fancy). 
    it should be open source on github

Aha, I get that. but with the old system it was still possible to sell helios credentials, (or simply broadcast the vote-via shoulder surfing, screensharing, SSL proofs etc) as evidence,  just as it would be possible to outright sell a token here.

You're not making sense. XCP is the token, CounterParty is the protocol. BTC is the token, Bitcoin is the protocol.
What you're asking is equivalent to saying 'there's no proof bitpay is using BTC' .
If they are leveraging Bitcoin, protocol dictates in some circumstances BTC is required.

Equity based fundraising already exists, (albeit in a legal grayzone) tokens are distributed as 'rewards' rather than pronounced stock. Most of the entities operating in this space have already been in correspondence with the SEC.
Backers can in theory be rewarded with anything in this approach. T-shirts, discount coupons, gold coins, etc.
 it's easily possible on vanilla counterparty, (only bitcoin is required) Since it's a decentralized network with no barrier to entry (just a bitcoin fee is required to register an asset), no credit rating agency filtering out scammers from legitimate offerings you often rely on doing your own diligence or a service which will do that on your behalf, and handle multisig based fund releases based on agreed milestones. 
 You can see example apps that raised funds in this way here

It seems very buggy right now, but like the idea and can imagine improvements in future. I seem to be alone on that though..
For non-foundation members- these are the two platforms now used for voting: (Helios was the old system)
the first one is an unofficial site that shows the voting stats as it happens on the blockchain.
new system : 
old system:  
**Helios** - private: no one knows how you voted.
**New voting mechanism**; Blockchain based, transparent for the world to see.
I've heard that the fact the new voting mechanism is not private is a weakness. Could someone elaborate more on why that is the case? Is this information better to be hidden until published, than for all to observe?

Wow.. this is fascinating,. Potentially game changing for swapping micro-assets and facilitating quick p2p trade of tokens. I'm thinking of the effect this could have on cutting out intermediary and middlemen, used for digital representations; everything for say, 1 GB of space to some rare game item, discount store coupon/voucher, concert ticket and more. 
Pretty exciting stuff if it begins to come to fruiton, and the fact it benefits the bitcoin blockchain itself and not some alternate chain  gives more of a value add to securing and pushing the network forward IMO. Good work guys. Going to keep an eye on future updates.
