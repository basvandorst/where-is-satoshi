I honestly couldn't care about his past. Whether allegations are true or not, as long as he's not diddling kids on the side how does it affect his current position on Bitcoin? 
Do you think he's going to be promoting it as a means for pedophiles to exchange value? If so, running on that platform sounds like a focus on increasing anonymity of Bitcoin. Which I'm all for an increase of built-in anonymity tools.
Most people are not against Brock directly, but against the idea of the "foundation" as a whole. Brock just happens to be the newest and easiest attack point. A centralized consortium of self interested individuals masquerading as the face of a decentralized protocol needs to end. Either that, or they need to get their act together and invest in the Bitcoin community, currently it appears to need lobbyists and mass media interviews to correct the spread of misinformation.

You're missing their market depth. Volume is meaningless, depth is not.
Yes the volume is high on sites such as Huobi and for the most part should be ignored, if not taken with a large grain of salt. The market depth on the other hand somewhat justifies their position among top exchanges. There are no indications their depth is faked; It appears to support both shorts and longs better than other exchanges.

What's the intrinsic value of eliminating or lessening the damaging effect of database breaches/leaks/hacks. Identity theft, unauthorized charges, and counterfeit fraud are greatly reduced, if not eliminated all together when using the reference protocol.

I would rather see them offer their name and reputation as an escrow service, rather than a wallet provider. 
Paypal's current terms and policies are very parasitical. They should not be trusted as a custodial account for Bitcoin. Any wallet service they offer will likely remove any and all security from Bitcoin and allow for charge-backs. I don't see them charging too high of a fee unless they offered some sort of insurance service.
If/When paypal does integrate Bitcoin, it would still be in the best interest for both parties to transact directly, outside of paypal, and on the Bitcoin blockchain. We don't need more third parties trying to involve themselves as  middlemen for Bitcoin transactions.

The ability to operate and use the exchange without the collection of personal private data.
The AML/KYC "compliance" pose a massive security issue with mass identity theft being a single security breach away. No entity or company in the Bitcoin space should be entrusted with having to secure and protect private documents and the identity of it's users.
Identity theft is very real, sending/sharing private documents online needs to stop.

Vancouver sun, so I'm guessing Canada. $709 CAD = about $640 USD. 
Looking at the single picture in the article, to me, it's overpriced.  The condition is decent, but far from perfect.  In an auction the price would be far less.

Try watching some of these Bitcoin 101 videos. They give a good introduction and explanation to get you started.
Learning about Bitcoin is a massive endeavor, don't expect to learn it all in only a few minutes and don't be turned off by the apparent steep learning curve. It will take days/weeks/months to start getting the full grasp of what Bitcoin is and how it works.

As much as I want to support the artist, I don't support the distribution method used.

He could still sue without the need to disprove their claims.  Newsweek's evidence speaks for itself and would very likely get thrown out awarding claims of damages to Dorian.  
I do hope he chooses not to sue and remains humble.  Not only would it show he's the better person for it, but I'd also cringe at the sight of MSM headlines as they attempt to cover the story.

No, the cause was not heartbleed, transaction malleability, or any future crisis which may be blamed.
It was a combination of (most likely) an inside job on top of three years worth of complete and utter incompetence in upper management. Solvency rumours and suspicions have been an issue with Mt.Gox since the 2011 hacks, lawsuits, and fiat seizures.

It's a good thing the bitcoin foundation doesn't represent anyone other than themselves. They have as much control over Bitcoin as they have over the US government.
All these "scandals" in the "foundation" are positive for the Bitcoin community as a whole. It will help separate and show the misinformed that the foundation and bitcoin are not one in the same.
The sooner we can get people to stop viewing the foundation as an integral part of Bitcoin the better. These scandals will only hasten that process.

Bitcoin does not force charge-backs, disputes, escrow, counter party risk, or anything that may fall under the false title of "consumer protection".
This however, does not mean you can't opt to use such a service.  Trusted third party escrow services, multi-sig transactions, and smart contracts are all possible with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is programmable money, you are free to use it anyway you like.  Sadly you chose not to use any "consumer protection" and made an irreversible transaction with a random stranger on the internet.  Bitcoin is still an early beta experiment, not yet geared towards the non tech savvy.  It's getting more user friendly every day, but will never be fully without risk.
Neither your loss, or doubts in Bitcoin are the fault of the protocol or it's ability to be "good for the real world"
Your complaint could be compared to placing cash in an envelop and mailing it, then getting mad at the post office when the recipient doesn't deliver.
While I'm not trying to, nor do I advocate punishing the victim; But I do believe people need to take responsibility for their own actions.  Trusting strangers on a forum because they have an old account, or rep is a disaster waiting to happen.

Instead of changing our symbol, why not throw money around with an organized effort to get our symbol added to the unicode database.
I refuse to change our symbol for nothing but convenience; Especially when the main concern is with the media and their poorly researched fud that passes as journalism these days. 
Using the current unicode substitute of the Thai Baht works well enough and doesn't cause confusion as it's "close enough" to our original.

I'm sure contact will first be made through Dorian's lawyer.
If Dorian chooses to accept the donation, I hope it's kept quiet and without the attention of the media, or even the Bitcoin community.

He had equal opportunity to buy them at $550 as well, he chose not to.
Instead of selling to him directly, help him get set up on an exchange. Allow him to find his own "right time to buy".

I'm still convinced they suffered major loss during the potential 2011 hack and have been insolvent since then.
They could have been running as a fractional reserve exchange while trying to recoup losses from fees.  
Transaction malleability *cough* poor coding implementation by Gox *cough* played a part, but very unlikely to be the single point of failure for coins reported as stolen.
They knew they had problems, and anyone who used gox in the past two years knew something wasn't right.  For them to come out and claim they never knew is just absurd. Cold storage doesn't leak, hot wallet re-fills would not be automated without some accounting/balance checking.
Only reason they halted trading fraction reserve goxcoins was due to the rising price.  They were clearly manipulating the price downward in order to "lock in" the price per Bitcoin to later settle in fiat.  Sell off the remaining Bitcoin holdings at true market value while retaining their last price of $135 makes their negative balance sheet look better.

If gamblers made long term profits, casinos would be out of business.
Perfect static odds always give a house advantage. For example an advantage of 2%, over the long term every gambler will have winning streaks, and loosing streaks but that 2% advantage will continuously eat away at their initial balance. They use a small advantage which adds up over time to help entice gamblers who think they might one day beat the house because every loss can follow a win minus 2%.
Whether that makes sense or not, the answer is still no. Gambling is only profitable for the house which plays the long game of small advantages.

Not quite mainstream. They are still under the impression that getting paid in Bitcoins is a negative by the sentiments of the comic.
Mainstream will be a comic that does the opposite. An employer suddenly refuses to pay employees in Bitcoin and opts for fiat which causes distress and worries company investors with liquidity and solvency issues.

CoINVALIDation is the worst concept/idea to come to Bitcoin. It has the ability to completely kill fungibility between coins destroying Bitcoin as a currency and adding immense counter party risk.
While the intentions may be good on the surface, they hide a much darker political agenda. Rejection and/or reporting of Bitcoins based on history of their transaction is something the community needs to unite and fight.
The camels nose comes to mind every time I hear about coINVALIDation

Don't forget to send an email through their contact forms.
They have a subject option labeled "payment option questions" Best place to request bitcoin.
Make sure you're polite and highlight how they can accept bitcoin with no volatility risk. I would also suggest making a point about how your identity cannot be stolen if there's a database hack on their site. No matter how secure their servers are, Bitcoin doesn't store any identifying or otherwise information that would compromise your identity or privacy.

Don't blame Coinbase too much, the fault lies with the regulators.  Demands of KYC, and AML compliance causes a lot of friction for purchasing and selling Bitcoins.  I'm sure they would offer a smoother new user experience if they could.  Direct your disappointment and anger to regional regulators.
Unfortunately there's not many options outside of jumping through all their hoops.  I can say, once you're verified everything becomes much easier and quicker.

I'll focus on one of the normally overlooked benefit to using Bitcoin instead of existing payment processors/networks/providers.
Identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized charges *_cannot_* occur when paying in with Bitcoin.
None of the information stored or broadcast during transactions contain any sensitive or damaging information. Retailer hacks and database breaches will not affect you in any way.
When you make a purchase using Credit or Debit card, the retailer is required to store and maintain your personal data for an extended period of time. This is either done directly or through a third party processor/company. 
Regardless how your data is stored, it is vulnerable to leaks, hacks and completely out of your control. You could become the victim of fraud by swiping your card at a local gas station years prior and never know. Yes, there are "consumer protections" and insurance to protect you in this event, but more often than not the damage is already done. Additionally, these high fee "protections" pale when Bitcoin can eliminate the problem all together.
Here's a couple links worth taking a look at.
