I checked it out and it seems like that sub is mostly for drugs and other illegal items. 
I'm looking to make legal purchases only. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:27:29
either way, good luck enforcing it.

Dumbest thing I've read all week.

I only access my wallet by generating it using the seed from my memory while using TAILS.
I don't store it anywhere. 
I was just hoping to find some kind of wallet that requires both seed and password.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:07:13


I didn't say you couldn't, mate.

Keeping them physically, on paper-wallets, in a safe doesn't sound that safe.
I have my electrum wallet seed memorized. 
I restore my wallet from seed using electrum on TAILS every time I want to access my btc.
I think this is about as safe as you can get.

Any software equivalents? I hear lots of complaints about not being able to access trezor due to server downtime.
Also, trezor costs money.

Thanks, I'll check them out.

i thought he password is only a local encryption needed to authorize payments because everything i generate my wallet from seed i don't have to input a password.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:50:34


and you base that statement on on what, exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:56:23
Thanks. Anything that increases security makes me feel better.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:56:35
for someone not in the U.S. and not affected by the outcome you seem to have some strong opinions on our politics.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:37:01
Thanks for the offered support but the user already deleted their account. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:18:36
Yeah, I was thinking that if they're a LBC scammer then they've probably got a lot of disputes filed.
The woman I spoke with from paypal said that they just added digital goods/bitcoin support to the resolution process sometime this month. 
Maybe things are looking up for bitcoin sellers who accept paypal.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:39:01


What do you mean by act accordingly? Got any tips other than not accepting paypal at all?
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:57:06
Just got off the phone with paypal. Sent them screenshots of the transaction history and they released my funds. 
I'd say it looks like it went in my favor.

That's not really significant. It's been worth as much as $1216.73 and I think it started out at like $0.32
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:40:45
That's assuming I save my wallet file, which I don't. 
For security I restore from seed (which I have memorized) every time. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 19:49:46
isn't this why we need stealth addresses?
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:31:06
Maybe you broke rule 


@_date: 2015-03-31 18:31:13
I managed to get 1.9.8 installed but I'm having trouble generating my wallet from seed. 
I entered the correct seed but it's showing a balance of 0 and it's not showing any history or receiving addresses.

"hahahaha" - U.S. Government

Thanks, I'll check it out

* Go to corner store.
* Buy a moneypak card/whatever is available in your area
* Go to localbitcoins.
* Buy bitcoins.
Pretty easy.

I'm trying on linux (tails) now but when I try to restore from seed I'm getting the following error return:
ImportError: No module named pbkdf2
Does that sound like a problem with my python install?
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:52:49
Cool, that might be what I'm looking for. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:36:40


That's not the only way to acquire bitcoins. I never had to provide any personal information when I got mine. 
Also, who cares if it allows the black market to launder coins, especially when you're arguing the merits of cash over bitcoin? As if cash is never used for illegal transactions and laundering.

You don't have to meet people in person in order to buy them anonymously.
