I already started to code!
However there are some mistakes that your book does not follow what it says. For example in the first part 1. the lesson1-4 are not reminded to be added in the program.cs, also they don't work if we don't add all the previous code and so on. Looking forward version 2 of the book with some more fixes :) Cheers!

Well no one says why they will not buy GOG games if they accept bitcoin and I wonder why, and how come people care if there is one more option for purchasing ? 
Google wallet. amazon payments, paypal - I have accounts on all of those services and there is no difference for me. They all use the same debit card i have, Except they all take different amounts of fees from GOG. While the Bitcoin actually takes the fees (miner fees) from the users., therefore GOG can offer lower price for purchasing with Bitcoin -&gt; more sales automatically!

or spend the same amount BTC that you mined :)
spend and mine more.

I recently loaded my account with 5EUR worth of BTC.
Few days later I created a virtual debit card with their service, which also created an account for 
I then confirmed this virtual debit card.
I sold 2EUR Worth of BTC from the SpectroCoin website, and then transfered this amount to the virtual card.
Now I have 3EUR in BTC and 2EUR in Virtual debit card.
I used the cash in the virtual card to purchase some cheap stuff from aliexpress.com. They confirmed the transaction and sent the items. 
This is my experience with SpectroCoin.

I tested MultiBit at home, but it has always on part of btc share for the miners.
So I had 0.01 in my multibit wallet and tried to transfer it to my btc-qt and i had to do a 0.099(9) btc transaction.

You may be right about that, and I did not consider it, the change in difficulty when it goes way up, and we when people with the GPU miners will stop working :)
So we have very uncertain future. Lets hope for the best.
And thanks for the tip!

You are making me think harder now :)
 - Here we have some more things to consider.
Well from a financial point maybe the taxes and the exchanging in fiat that gives you loss for fees. But that is what we are all used to so it cant be a /good/ bad reason. Then maybe the exactly the fluctuation of the currency, and maybe the future because of the new ASIC Miners, as a lot of people are suggesting the price going down, so the infochart will become inaccurate (as this is pointed that the future is unknown)
Oh maybe that we buy something with bitcoins but it scales with the exchange - today it costs 10$ or 0.10BTC but when btc/usd goes down it will cost 10$ and 0.25BTC, and that is kind of bad, becouse its too fast to change not like real money when the inflation goes up, the prices lag behind few months.

I like it. It shows the good side of bitcoin. However someone must make a similiar chart with the bad sides.
