Exactly same situation, been trying for 2 months, once I showed proof of my bitcoin address they stopped responding, I email every week now, never get a reply.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:32:26
How is it going? They responded a few times but now nothing. Really starting to piss me off.

@_date: 2016-10-11 18:47:11
Yeah we just opened the website so I don't want to do too much too soon. It's in the plans
@_date: 2016-10-11 18:48:04
Yeah I know openbazaar. Looking into it but need to figure out taxes and stuff
@_date: 2016-10-11 18:49:10
^^^I ^^^am ^^^so ^^^sorry
@_date: 2016-10-11 18:52:37
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:36:14
Oh yeah sorry I didn't explain the part where I don't want to change back. I would rather keep them bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:26:42
Na I know what you are saying. I have sold the mug for 3 years, it just got popular today. I only launched the website last week and I need to make sure everything runs smoothly first. Then I will start adding more features. Secondly I am VAT registered so I need to cross things with my accountant before adding Virtual Currency. Adding a payment processor for bitcoin is easy, I just have to make sure tax wise I have everything sorted and the accountants understand too. I hope other people who accept bitcoin do the same as me and make sure everything is good before just jumping into it.
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:10:29
Yeah it's actually more confusing to do than you think. We just got the website up and running and we need to sort out with the accountants to start bitcoin. Don't worry I will be part of bitcoin soon!
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:16:43
I'm not sure if people just take the piss and say this now. Level of stupidity is too high
