I'm not saying that Bitcoin won't work, I'm saying it serves a different purpose than banks and won't supplant them.  I don't think this is being close minded.

Most people don't want to store thousands of dollars in cash at their house.

Yeah, pooling money to build roads and fund fire departments is just like some kid stealing my hubcaps!

How would a bank function without fractional reserve banking?

They weren't paying taxes.

That isn't really a bank, then.  Why would anyone use that business?

Yeah, I don't think banks will be going away soon.  I can keep my cash in a sock drawer today, but I don't.  I keep my money in a bank.  Bitcoin doesn't change that, no matter how popular or widely accepted it becomes.

But how would I withdraw money from a savings account if that money has been loaned to an investor?  
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:59:32
Right.  So most people would not be happy with that arrangement.

Not compared to Bitcoin, it isn't.
