I can't say for certain, nobody really can. A while back it jumped up to $70 and stayed there for so long while BTC took off. Who knows if the same won't happen here, it might sit steady where it is or drop a little while BTC goes on to $40,000+.
It's a weird market and I'm not going to pretend I have a crystal ball, Litecoin makes up about 25% of my portfolio, it's a good coin with a lot of room to grow.

Yes and no, BTC has very high transaction fees currently.
Whereas if you'd bought $100 worth of Litecoin a few weeks ago you'd be up to $300 already.

Yes and no. If you cash out a bit now to buy assets (like property) then its value will remain. In the future it might just be worth 10 BTC instead of $200,000. But either way you still own the house. 
Having a few "safe" investments is a good idea.

The idea that I'm rich is kinda laughable. The mortgage is gone because I spent my 20s working in mines sleeping on a foam mattress in an empty room saving everything I could. 
Now my income is well below average. But I'm a stingy fucker so I still save.

While this is obviously a troll...
People mortgaging their homes for crypto is fantastic for me. I'm near mortgage free and hold a good amount in coins. 
Crypto rises and I make money, crypto crashes and I can scoop some cheap investment properties.

I live in a fairly small town in Australia (150k people) with reasonable house prices.

We're heading there with smart contracts. Though it's still pretty far away.

And that kids name was Elbert Ainstein. 
This is where we know crypto is reaching peak popularity. When shitty anti-intellectual circlejerk memes start getting shared by your mother. 
1500% increase on an investment over 37 years is about 7.6% pa. University costs way too much but let's not pretend this isn't a lazy jab at folks who really aren't the cause of the issues crypto is trying to solve.

They have many friends. The ones in power they pay for, also those who own the media who convince the populace to keep their friends in power

This meme keeps getting used based on nothing. 
When we’re back to 18k plus then you can gloat, until then you just look stupid.
