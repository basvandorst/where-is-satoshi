What fee did you specify? If it was too low it will be dropped and your funds should be returned in a week or so 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:28
It can take up to a week to credit your account. Next time transfer money then buy btc, it's instant

Roger got in early with some luck and made millions but that does not give him superior knowledge or the right to determine the direction of btc. He and Jihan have been corrupted by the money and are colluding to promote bch since Bitmain's ASICS give him an advantage on bch but not btc (due to segwit). I've heard the guy on several interviews, he's not that bright or visionary imo...its just gone to his head. Core has the best developers as well, who are the bch developers? In the end btc is the people's money and will prevail. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:41:54
Welcome! My advice is read as much as you can/watch YouTube videos to learn. Be careful though, you're going to go down the rabbit hole...enjoy! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:21:49
Nice! Welcome to the club 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:03:51
Segwit effectively increased the block size and now paves the way for layer 2 solutions (like lightning). This will solve the transaction speed issue... increasing block size is a simplistic, temporary solution and will not scale in the long run. This is why the core developers are way smarter and visionary. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:27:43
Exactly it's been tried before and failed. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:55:52
Lol what a bunch of rookie developers...its like core is the pros and these guys are a high school team

If you have Bitcoin, you will get Bitcoin gold on October 24th and Bitcoin 2X on November 1st. This is only guaranteed if you hold your own private keys so that's why you need to store them on a cold wallet.
