Adding that in fact the predictions were laser accurate on the run to 8500 and will again be accurate the next run as this is going higher as modeled an projected with accuracy.  Fact the math worked for predicting price 2 months in advance.  Indisputable fact.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:17:46
What you see in the order books as sells walls are miners taking profits before we hit the next price point.  They are not market selling.  This is just part of the algorithm.  It's a circle people
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:10:46
If every is trading fibs and we are dealing with a circle, therfore every fib action we would have a natural opposite reaction.  This cyclical motion, in addition to candle box law keeps the price stablaized for both miners and investors.

@_date: 2018-05-26 07:46:01
It appears so.  I have bunch of other observations not published yet.  Academia should be able to reverse engineer the math and confirm or deny.  Based on the 2 green candles that just adjusted the length of the radius, I say my theory is fact 
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:01:08
Theory would bring the price back up to the last level of 7339.  That's it's purpose.  It ensures miners continue mining.  It would need to transfer to the next ring, enabling a price drop, then the algorithm pulls it back to 7339 area.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:00:05
Applied at ring transfer moments.  Smaller rings show that happening.  You must exit the circle opposite where you entered.  Mathmatically.
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:00:08

Price moves like a token around a ring.  Very similar to the token ring protocol which is decentralized networking.  The price token is passed around the ring.

I don't see it moving down.  Mathmatically it returns to current circle and there are a ton of pissed off people in the futures market that relied in this 
@_date: 2018-05-26 04:40:33
And if therory is true, the exact correct price of a Bitcoin is exactly 7339.  We would have a massive run up and sell off.   No one else would buy for higher than 7339 aside from shorts.  I am glad I gathered much coin and have my limit orders set.

Refer to candleboxlaw for greater understanding
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:18:45
You actually supported the law in your statement.  Everyone using fibs creates the chaos and the law injects perfect circles to stabilize price.  It's the protocols protection mechanism, which is the CandleBox Law;). If you can determine the path of the CandleBox law patrern, you can much better predict the low point.

@_date: 2018-05-23 17:43:24
Mathmatically, it is highly  improbable that we transfer to the next ring down.  There would need to be a larger sell off than we have now.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:52:04
Does it rally work with triangles???  I guess it would being that it's just tracking 3 points

Sir..buying BTC and having it increase in value, never selling it...getting a loan against it with NO TAX...then taking the loan and if it tanks....a clear tax WRITE OFF!

I have not but will read up on that.  I just started up my business here and have model in my head.  Good to know people are thinking in a futuristic fashion.  I have a fair amount of BTC myself and doing some deep diving on how to leverage it without cashing it out.  If you don't cash it out, there is no tax.  Perhaps taking a "cache" of BTC and using it for fiat to start a lending company to purchase BTC is a good idea?? lol.  That would be the modern BTC bank.  You can issue cards and "resell" bitpay and like services.  Brianstormin' over here!

The Relative Strength Index (RSI), developed by J. Welles Wilder, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.

I was not referring to moving your 401K to all BTC as is it  not really an option you will find in any employer sponsored 401K.  My personal strategy was t shift the balance of my 401 to international equity or a low risk fixed income asset type.

If the top 1% of BTC creates a reliable and secure leading platform for the "average person" following a sofi and upstart lending model...then BCT replaces FIAT.  No one even knows what bitcoin is.  You must remove yourself from the throne as a forward thinker. All that needs to be done is cut merchant credit card fees by 25% and make it secure.  Everything stems from that.
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:53:05
Who is "us"?  Yes, long term, BTC can only replace FIAT when those with major positions lend to the those who have exemplary credit living in a serfdom.   The new "banks" must lend and allow for small business.  The dream is "the pursuit of happiness" not debt.

Thoughts on borrowing to buy BTC? If you have good credit, does it make sense to borrow? Will BTC be used as collateral in the near future? Is the next ICO one that can enforce BTC in escrow? Failure to pay on the loan is an automatic deduction against your BTC? Is a loan with an easily manageable payment a hedge against volatility? What is the future?

OPM built this country right? As an cyber security executive, trader and business owner, I believe it makes sense applied to bitcoin.  The key is ensuring the monthly payment is manageable.  I see being able to convert a loan today via a type of "JG Wentworth / 
 structured settlement" ICO in the near distant future.  Essentially, as BTC grows, you get paid now for the future gains or similar concept based on BTC as collateral.  Not sure how you would work out details behind the scenes.  Just thinking out loud here.  Incredible ICO concept.

this is for the group.  unless BTC can be insured in a parallel fashion to the FDIC and NCUA, it will not achieve its intended purpose.  At the highest level, I can see a "debt relief" program BTC "bond" securitized and packaged.  However, security and credibility is paramount.  A voting system must be created which is based on block chain.  The next phase of BTC is a voting system.  Only way to stop madness.   We have disrupted FIAT and drawn attention.  I understand banking.  There are how many intelligent users with a credit score of?   FIAT only need 10% on value.  
Facts to be had:
I make 180K a year with a credit score of 812. I can easily borrow half a million at a decent rate.  How many of me are there?  How much BTC do people like me have?  What is the conversion rate for people on the edge?  How many X people like me does it take to borrow enough to flip the dollar?  Perhaps we take out the power or oil industry?  Pick a segment and take it over with borrowed money?  On a leap...collaborate and "buy" greece.  Get a seat at the UN table?  We are at the next phase.  Take a 3rd world country and pay its debt, take over as government.  I have endless ideas.  Philly conference?

My real talk position is to treat BTC like a 401K.  Buy and hold for 15 years.  That is my strategy.  That is my recommendation.  It is a good time to enter the market.  This is not the stock market.  I am an early adopter.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:14:46
The 12, 6 and 4 hour RSI are at zero. We just had a sell off after folks got their "gold".  I am stating, emphatically, this is a good entry point for a long term hold.  If you disagree, provide any logical reason. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:09:40
While I hear what you are saying, the concept of OPM is what makes the world "tick" to date.  It makes the FED run...lol.  How and why is BTC any different?  Why would standard OPM rules not apply here if you are looking at a 3 to 5 year investment?  The fork will result in at least one version of BTC retaining current value after the dust settles, correct?  Perhaps I am overlooking critical variables here?  
I also believe that per IRS tax codes, this loan would be a tax deduction in the event is heads south.  At minimum you could deduct the whole thing.  Obviously a worse case scenario but still something...lol.  I am not a CPA but surely there is a deduction in there somewhere.   Tooooo add...WOW BTC just took a nice little bump on price!!  Maybe it was a loan that finally funded...HAHA!
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:24:11

Pretty much a perfect prediction on my part
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:59:40
Lets use the following scenario.  A person with a good job has been maxing out their 401k for the past 10 years.  They have a credit score of 775, house, car and 2 kids.  Their 401k balance is around 150k and they are 37-42 years old.  They carry little to zero credit card debt.  They get an unsecured loan in the amount of 15k - 30K with a monthly payment of $650 @ 8%-12% over 5 years (same as a new car loan).  They can already afford this loan but in a crisis, they could tap the 401K in an emergency.  The plan is to not worry about trading and gain the net value after 5 years.   BTC gains have grossly exceeded the 12% loan rate.   Make sense?  Y/N?

bitcoin is high risk and high reward.  if someone wants to try their hand at daytrading as a new user, best of luck.  not a strategy i recommend.  The best strategy for long term is pick a point (like today) to enter at a few hundred.  then setup weeks buys at nominal amounts.  if you do that, daily averaging kicks in and you no longer need be concerned with stop loss.  that is my recommendation.

the mere fact that anyone needs to talk about stop losses is an example of why we have these swings.  buy and hold long term stabilizes the market.  Stop loss and swing talk entice panic selling which only results in people losing coin and cash.  I stand by "Buy and HODL".
