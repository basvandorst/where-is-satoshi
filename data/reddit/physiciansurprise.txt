Now they blame me for playing minecraft beta all the time back in 2010 when I was 14 instead of using my gaming pc for mining bitcoins.

Consider yourself lucky, my parents almost kicked me out.

Let him transfer the money immediately. It's just a stupid risk for you to keep the private key. If someone gets access over their wallet, the first person they are going to blame may very likely be you, when in reality it could be someone else.

You can retire at 40

Pathetic. Worst part is that you keep the private code of someone else's wallet. Very selfish of you. You should at least educate the father and let him transfer the value to their own wallet that YOU don't have access to.

Um.. no. It can be selfish for many reasons. OP has also made it clear that he will educate the father (and hopefully the kid in the future as well) which I hope he does.

Problem is that the exchange I am using has around 10% fee and for now I can't use any other exchange where I am from with my debit card ��

I was never assuming he was going to steal, that's what you are doing. It's pathetic because it's super shady.

She's lucky that she has a father who saves her money in bitcoin. When she's 18, the year is 2027 and we all know what the estimated value for bitcoin is at that year.
