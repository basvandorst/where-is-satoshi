One look at localbitcoins was enough to put me off for this. I'd have to do the full value in multiple transactions, chance are they are all different values, then I have to suss each and every person out etc. There's like a week or more of work there between meeting and greeting and what have you - then the same again on the other side. It's stressful enough moving to another country, starting a new job and buying a house. I sure as hell don't want to add to that. People keep on saying give localbitcoins a chance - and sure, if I had all the time and energy in the world for this maybe it would be worth it. But coupled with everything else that is happening at the moment, hell no.
edit:hence the move the money together rule.

I'm the OP who posted this originally in IWantOut. There are a lot of reasons LocalBitcoins put me off very quickly.
a) It seems, to my understanding, likely I'd have to buy off multiple people, which involves dealing with them all and likely getting different prices for each transaction. If not I'm going to have to suss around to find someone to do the full amount. Then we dance around each other for a bit trying to work out if we trust each other and if this whole thing is going to go through, that will all take time. The hypothetical 50K is a lot of money to blindly start dealing directly with people over.
b) I need the money moved now. My SO is buying the house before I get to the states, can't buy house without the deposit.
c) You move country, change jobs, and buy a house then decide how much extra stress you want to add on top of all that as well. Getting money around stress free has a price, and it's the price I'm willing to pay the forex to do it quickly for me.
