Doesn't matter, because a non-cash chain is not valid. 
Bitcoin is a Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System.

"Bitcoin - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Bitcoin - NOT a segregated non-cash settlement system.

No, in my analogy, we call the Segregated non-cash settlement coin not Bitcoin.

BS. Bcash is a brazililan payment company and a segregated non-cash coin cannot be bitcoin, because such a chain is - by definition - not valid.

The non-cash version of Bitcoin will never be Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be Peer-To-Peer Cash.

**Bitcoin** is A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System.
A settlement system will - by definition - never ever be Bitcoin.

LOL, yes, that's the mentality of this ridiculous cen sored 'forum'. 
The definition of Shitstream's UASF bolsheviki army is what counts; not Satoshi's.
BS in perfection.

Bitcoin is a great name. That's the reason why we use that name.
I call our coin Bitcoin (BCH) and I call ...
... our system **Bitcoin Cash**, which is the abbreviation of  "**Bitcoin** - A Peer-To-Peer Electronic **Cash** System".

Check yourself; it's obvious:
