Rather than insult you, I will reply with something of substance.
[His order to reduce regulation](
@_date: 2017-02-17 11:51:21
His ideology in favour of less spending, less war &amp; less regulation?
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:34:44
He did meet in a very public place, and this is the UK - what 'arms' could he have?

We need more people to start mining - if you believe in and support Bitcoin, consider being a miner.

You can verify the times of these, I haven't seen one from above at the time Trump was on stage.

Just because it does not give full data, does not make something worthless.

Where are you getting this absurd multiplier from?
1. At what stage did he receive his inheritance?
2. How big was this inheritance?

Don't worry guys, the price will go up from the $3000 you bought at.

For the photo you keep mentioning to be of any use, it must have a time element we can verify - do you not see the importance of this?
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:50:09
So 45 mins before Obama had bigger crowds.
Look at people behind the last speaker stands to verify relative position.

Thanks for your input. I think it's seeing the published '45 mins before' photos without stating the time that had made me wary, as they just didn't match up to the CNN photos from the time of the inauguration. The latest photos you have posted do seem to correlate. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:55:10
Who determines bias? Someone with bias? It is CNN taking the photo, and you can verify the time. Can we verify the time on the photos you are using to show a smaller crowd? We need to be able to work from truths we can confirm to find the truth.

Thanks for the links, but he had been building his empire for years by 1987 - $500,000,000 is mostly wealth he generated himself. You can't cherry pick a year in the past that state liquidating all your assets and investing in an index would have been a wise decision, versus sitting on and investing in Real Estate, and claim it as a better choice.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:01:27
Can you explain how it cannot support this?
@_date: 2019-02-17 13:33:16
\&gt; Trump is just following Putin's orders.
Imagine actually believing this.
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:54:59


What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:30:28
Total value share.. I'd like to see actual an usage comparison (buying things). I see many alt coins as overvalued and will evaporate in favour of BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:13:33
Personally I do not rate Litecoin - people are not invested enough in it.. if people were, they need to get mining, and therefore gain a vote in how it should be developed. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:19:40
It is not misleading, it is showing exactly what is states; debt is increasing at a greater rate than revenue.
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:47:46
I'm hoping you have evidence to support this view, else this is just conjecture. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:40:55
Ok, but why are alts increasing? It's a speculation bubble, in my view , by people who regret not investing in Bitcoin earlier.
@_date: 2017-04-16 13:41:22
My thoughts exactly. I view it as an uncensored store of value like Gold - you don't trade with it everyday. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:52:07
Great response. After investigating a little more last night I am siding more with this view.. but Litecoin? I see as a bubble. Ethereum looks to have it's place, and as you say for storing value Bitcoin is the most secure.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:16:46
They put forward reasons of technical debt, dirtier architecture as reasons for not upgrading. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:34:42
Miners have always been designed to be the ones with the power - their opinion is the one that matters, I view your comment as just an opinion I do not share.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:48:47
Complete agreement - where can you spend these altcoins, versus Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:12:45


*increases ambiguity
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:59:48
Miners are part of Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-04-26 14:21:12
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:41:40
Network effects also give value.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:54:02
How do you know this? I'm stating what they have written between each other..
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:44:18
Oversold territory - reversal will be quick from here - slower from 2200 up, I believe.
