Yes the price was up massively in December! Mass adoption hasn't even begun yet - thanks to the {{ banksters }} it's just too hard to get hold of Bitcoins. 
This needs to change.

It's coming. The banksters, presstitutes, politicos etc. are struggling to offer anything to the masses. The average joe still has a keen interest in making money for themselves cashing in and out of crypto is the pain point at the moment from what I see.

Argentina Venezuela? Complete basket cases - 100% predictable. 
The West? Too many vested interests for a complete collapse. If the middle men lose their shirt would only be the correction the system needed.
Looking forward to it.

Yes, it pays to be an early adopter. However, these people risked all their money at first and so deserve to benefit now.
For smaller amounts &lt; 5K why not altcoins? There are some interesting ones trading under $5 which will not stay there if they gain traction, much as ETH rose early this year.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:53:56
yes but at present BTC is the best store of value.
Do not knock this feature...look at what happens when you deposit your ugly fiat with the banksters

No, its not the time. There are futures to come, plus the mania phase
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:15:49
I read the article
"For assets denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, use the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s foreign currency exchange rates to convert the denomination into U.S. dollars. If a foreign currency exchange rate for a particular currency is not available there, use another publicly available foreign currency exchange rate to convert the value of a specified foreign financial asset into U.S. dollars. The exchange rate is determined by reference to the exchange rate on the last day of your tax year."
Do not see how this can involve crypto when not converted

@_date: 2017-12-10 07:16:36
buy now! 
I would be very surprised if USD 17K was the peak. It doesn't feel like the end of BTC just yet. The general public have not really got into it in a big way plus we have its gradual acceptance in the financial system. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:30:32
thanks will try them
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:45:46
By all means sell at 19K - I am HODLing since it is going to go much higher. People are getting interested.
With Bitcoins, you have access to the whole Alt coin sphere too.

waiting for 10-11 or some action this week.
It looks like it has bottomed out at 13-14 which is disappointingly familiar :) ie onwards and upwards
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:54:14
its a future derivative of bitcorn 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:47:37
if you are having trouble buying Ill sell you a millions worth if necessary
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:22
sell at 100000
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:08:01
the fact that BTC recovers so quickly is a good portent for future ATHs.
The last high will come when there is a *serious* crypto rival.

Hey I am looking for some Bitcoin bling- anyone know anyone making/selling this stuff?
Id like some knuckle rings with like BTC HODL
and a small B ear ring maybe a chunky Bitcoin medallion.
Any ideas?

yes I want 10 too -please panic and sell

everyone will disagree because the theory is not backed up with water-tight argumentation.
I mean how do you get from stock market crashes ==&gt; bitcoin folds?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:32:56
support level. Also a psychological level.
That said, seems to be steadying (for another push) at 13. If it does, its plus ca change and up we go again next week

My Mom always said you need a buffer for major purchases/black swans and a modest regular income
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:34:03
pretty sure many have thought this one through.
My strategy is not to get too greedy and HODL a percentage just in case of a moon landing.
If we are talking 100K a coin, you don't need to risk too much to be a part of it, just a few coins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:25:50
more interesting to me is the use of crypto by instutional investors for its high delta attribute
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:59:38
then usual exchanges or localbitcoins.
Where I am I can buy up to 500 Fiat at the train station 247
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:47:08
as much as you can afford.
At $500 you really need it to explode into space for it to be life-changing.
Even if gains next 12 months are similar, you need to borrow
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:49:45
Thats fine but what if it starts rising again above 20K?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:47:46
I have read most of what you wrote before. Fact is you can make a case for and against BTC. Its what you believe in that counts.
For me, it wont peak at 20K- much higher. 
Longer term, it probably wont be the currency for smaller tXs but for that we have a number of great up-and-coming coins. 
When the USD is gone, we will need a mother crypto currency in which everything is measured- that will be BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:11:24
In a few years maybe max 30% of people will have jobs anyway (hopefully mostly men but thats another story)- so retiring or just doing what the hell you want is the smart choice for most.
Unless you are really good at one thing and have the right connections ie Gates, Bezos etc
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:27:15
even if true there are other cryptocurrencies which you buy with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:17:09
By this time next year itll be at least $45K or back its true level of about $5-6
Please pin somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:30:24
It has to keep moving up or itll fall to more mundane levels.
I dont think the real mania has kicked in yet.
If so, it can touch 50-60K
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:23:39
Regulation is coming from the 2 evil twins you mentioned - it will come in the form of tax on capital gains from exchanges hosted in these countries. Already happening. 
But its navigable. For instance, exchanges offering BTC denominated debit cards. When the price stabilizes more opportunities to buy directly without fiat.
One Black swan would be a new better cryptocurrency which kills off Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:29:27
its done its dropping now on way back up

@_date: 2017-11-30 21:32:12
I am thinking of a way to do this- would it make a good business idea?
Local stores sell cards which are as good as cash. Cards can be sold online for BTC
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:34:41
Im buying on Monday - expect it to be down to 5000 by then :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:21
then you are a HODLer
Wait for 20K or whatever it is you are looking to buy.
No reason for it to crash just before things getting really exciting with futures...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:11
relax-price steady at 10K+ point
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:16:42
down with the usual suspects running the financial system- we need something more democratic
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:25:36
Its all or nothing for me.
Yeh I could cash out and buy a new car, or a fur coat, or whatever with my 100K but I want a life-changing event. Otherwise whats the point? 
Plus of course the joy in seeing the demise of this ugly economic system run by a handful of {nameless} sociopathic folks on the hill
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:32:52
which now also sucks

My (Asian) exchange hit 23K albeit very briefly overnight.
Its been jumping between 10 and 14K today. Madness.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:43
you have to look at what you can buy for a dollar. We arent just speaking about candy but the price of important items like college or a house versus real income (even upper quartile bands), or look at how USD and gold have developed since 1970
