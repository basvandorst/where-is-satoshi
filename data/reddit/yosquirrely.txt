Oh I didn't read the rest. I don't know if it would be a bad thing to have a very slight amount of appreciation. Maybe, maybe not. Asking me more questions isn't really answering anything or helping... I don't have the answers.
I don't know of any similar situations except for gold. But no one pays directly in gold. You just trade it.

Maybe. Maybe given the choice between atwo currencies they would prefer the inflationary one. I know I would.
I think my ideal would be neither. A currency that stays in exactly one spot seems perfect to me.

As far as i understand, you can't store bitcoin unencrypted. You only have the keys stored somewhere but the bitcoins are out there in public on the block chain all the time. I think what people did was give mgox the keys. So it essentially became mgox's money, but with a trust relationship that they would give it back. I guess that isn't what happened.
I still don't understand why people didn't have copies of their keys though.

Ha! A 24 hour clock is the... stupidest... thing... why aren't more clocks in 24 hours?

I don't think that's an example of an inflationary currency though, it's exchanging something when the time is right knowing that the exchange rate will probably turn around in the future. If american dollars continually went up in value in comparison to the peso people might be more inclined to hold it (or is that the case? I.e. is the peso constantly dropping further in value?)
