Mine is a very good way to earn money. You can start by mining altcoin if bitcoin is not suitable. It gives new users a chance to learn how to mine.  The network needs more miners to keep it decentral the, OP can earn coins while mining rather than buy them.
This is what crypto is all about.

This hack (if it even was one) has to be a inside job. the account the funds were stolen from was a multisig 3/4 address and x3 of the keys were used to sign the transaction. There is slim to no chance that attacker gained 3 private keys.. inside job or cover up... nothing else..

Best way to make money is to become miner. Not only is miner secure the network income is also good.  Stay away from many "get rich quick" scams in the bitcoin world. 
If you mine you secure your own income and support the network be decentralized
