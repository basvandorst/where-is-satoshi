It has to trust the Nxt network to feed it the chain, no? The thousands of peers who are all in agreement on the correct chain.

Can't the idea be copied and used in a decentralized way? Nodeshares has some servers running some nodes. Bitpay pays for some servers, Coinbase pays for some servers, Bitcoin foundation pays for some servers etc.

But no one would see them because you are on your own chain (in your own cluster).If there's one cluster which consists of millions of people doing transactions, and another cluster with the same person doing millions of fake transactions, it's pretty easy for the network to choose the correct chain without having to trust anyone.

Seems a great idea. Do it now before bitcoin becomes mainstream, the longer before it's done, the harder it'll be to sell.
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:42:58
But it's not relying on web of trust. Web of trust is a failsafe mechanism against the super unlikely and difficult history attack. PoS secures the network, and if someone spends considerable difficulty and expense of launching this history attack, it will automatically fail based on this.

The only WhitePaper you really need is working code.

Great initiative. A big problem in the way that bitcoin is currently set up is that there is no incentive for running full nodes. This allows companies who rely on bitcoin to put resources into ensuring that the bitcoin network is robust enough.

Counterparty also does what mastercoin does and what colored coins are trying to do. They seem further along, had a fairer distribution, and you don't really need to use the XCP tokens to use it.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:39:40
Nothing. There's no incentive. That's why no one runs them anymore.

"As for the history attack if it can be done at some profit it will be done."
And a 51% attack on bitcoin will be done if it can be done at profit.
So, bitcoin isn't trustless either, based on your arguments? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:46:10
Bitcoin could do with a failsafe against an unlikely and expensive 51% attack.
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:25:33
Also, I think your history attack hasn't been fully thought out. It's:
1. Get some old stake
2. ????
3. Profit.
You haven't bothered to figure out the 2 part. (Just assume that because this is PoS that part will be easy) Getting the longest chain implies getting the one with the most cumulative difficulty. So you try a few chains and they don't have enough difficulty, so you keep trying different ones, and you eventually figure out that you don't have the computing power to catch up with the valid chain (and it'd be easier to get enough computing power to 51% bitcoin).

But who wants/needs to rely 0conf on an over the internet transaction?
As I see it, those who say that 0conf is safe are generally referring to over the counter instances where 10 minutes is a long time. If 0conf is safe for those instances, then bitcoin can be used to buy coffee/fastfood/clothes in malls. If 0conf isn't safe in those instances, then that's a significant limitation on bitcoin.
Seems that 0conf is safe if you know the limitations (only use it in physical stores where time is crucial, and for relatively small amounts.)
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:03:01
It hasn't been implemented yet and I don't know the details well enough. But the issues you mention don't seem unsolvable.
I think that you massively under-estimate how difficult a history attack would be to pull off.
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:43:13
No one person or thing is providing info. You just check the network (governed by maths and software). This is no different from the bitcoin network providing info on which is the longest chain.

Start of the year, I was all about bitcoin. Knew that the altcoins could never offer any threat due to the network effect. Then I began to get worried about some of bitcoin's weaknesses. Began to explore the space a bit more. And most of the altcoins offered nothing, they were total trash. But a few offered advantages. So I explored more. Then I found NXT.
Nxt is clearly better than bitcoin. However, bitcoin still has the network effect so is still the favorite to win out. But if an altcoin does challenge bitcoin it will need to be one that offers huge advantages. The only real challenger is NXT. Recently it pushed up to be third in the charts behind bitcoin and litecoin and everyone knows that litecoin offers nothing new.
I spent months laughing off altcoins. Probably most in this subreddit are still doing that. But if you are going to check out one alternative to bitcoin, it should be Nxt. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 10:28:46
Fairly easy. A history attack is virtually impossible. The network has rolling checkpoints every day. If you start an attack more than a day ago, then it'll automatically be rejected. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:51:20
Based on most transactions. Vitalik Buterin discusses the concept here  calls it TaPoS (Transactions as Proof of Stake). EC is the same idea.
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:19:49
I agree the headline isn't doing you favors. Headline should should been: "Get 15% discount on Amazon purchases for paying with bitcon."
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:33:55
Thanks for the discussion. Hard to address everything right now, since EC isn't in operation yet. I'll be watching with interest the implementation of EC to see if it addresses the concerns you pointed out.
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:43:57
Not sure if it's up and running yet, but Counterparty set up a site to help support the network of bitcoin full nodes. 
Since there's no incentive for the ordinary person to run full nodes, then bitcoin companies (who make money from their usage of the bitcoin network) will possibly have to start supporting initiatives like that.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:52:34
Hopefully very few miners use this. Otherwise it'll force zero transaction confirmations to no longer be trusted.
@_date: 2014-07-22 09:20:00
You say that EC isn't trustless. Explain who you will have to trust when EC is implemented.

Not all PoS algorithms use coin-days-destroyed. DPoS and Nxt don't.
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:26:03
I think using offline computer to generate a wallet is overkill for most users. Multisig wallets are the future of bitcoin security for most people. e.g. bitgo
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:49:05
There are plenty of altcoins that are scams. Others that are straight clones of bitcoin. But some of them are innovative and might one day challenge bitcoin. But people who don't own them and own bitcoin will just call them scams for similar reasons that those who dislike bitcoin will call bitcoin a scam.
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:53:31
Where are you getting 7 from, there were 73 initial stakeholders in Nxt.
@_date: 2014-07-22 10:13:15
You don't have to trust anyone. The Nxt network will always be able to find the correct chain via PoS+EC. And what point do you think you make this determination of trusting someone?
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:57:45
You are welcome to try your 8point plan and see what happens. That didn't happen at all with Nxt but I think you know that and just don't like Nxt for some reason.
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:17:44
For ripple, you have to be added to a trusted server list. It's not decentralized in the same way as Nxt at all. There's a central company at the heart of it. (You really think Nxt is closer to ripple than bitcoin?!?)
Economic clustering is simply the network automatically forcing everyone to stay on the correct chain. It's not about trusting any one person or entity. Whatever chain the economic majority is on is the chain that everyone else is on.
Consider the following happening. Ghash (Or a malicious entity) gets 51% of the bitcoin network and that becomes the defacto chain. So bitcoin is forked, everyone else switches to this new fork which excludes the malicious entity. Which fork will you be able to spend your bitcoins on? The one with the highest PoW but which no one trusts(Ghash) or the one which everyone else is using (the new fork). Everyone will move to the new fork, so it's the economic majority which ultimately decides over PoS or PoW.
Economic clustering is about adding a failsafe to the network to make the chance of a history attack go from miniscule to zero. (Seems like bitcoin could use such a failsafe.)
I don't see how you can say Nxt is trustless based on your arguments. It's not about trusting any one entity or thing. You say that human intervention is needed? Where? Economic clustering implements a web of trust type algorithm whereby you are asked to trust the rest of the known world. If you query the rest of the known world and 99.999% agree, then are you not then happy that you are on the correct chain or do you feel you are being too trusting?

I think the authors of that paper use a different definition of long range attack. Here's a question and reply from one of the authors about what is described above: 
They haven't detailed their solution to that problem yet, hopefully soon.
