What kind of option are you thinking? Something like long traditional call, you will likely lose much more than 50% of your money when BTC goes down 50%. Leverage works both ways. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:35:10
If you’re only looking to triple at $50k, just long BTC? Right now the price is less than 1/3 of $50k...

That is not at all how futures work, futures are cash-settled usually daily. You're looking for call options, which AFAIK don't exist for BTC yet. With BTC/USD volatility so high, I think call options would likely be too expensive to be worth it anyway.

Unfortunately for people who trade very frequently, leaving coins on an exchange is much more practical, given transaction times &amp; fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:40:19
The two are different coins -- you can trade your BTC for BCH or vice versa through an exchange. The difference is that BTC has 1mb per block for transaction data while BCH has 8mb per block. With BTC's larger transaction volume &amp; BCH's larger block size, transactions are currently much faster and cheaper for BCH. It's unclear how scaling will work out in the future for both coins.
The fork is only relevant if you held private keys to a BTC wallet on August 1 (?) 2017, in which case you now have equal amounts of BTC and BCH.

Why is this the “real profit”?

I think BTC-e offers a MT4 client.

Seems legit. Check out the sidebar:


@_date: 2013-11-21 07:06:46
Don't get be wrong, I think it's great that you want to spread Bitcoins and all.
We just don't need morons like you trying to bribe police officers with it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:26:50


Rules on the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:09:15


If that's your philosophy, I think you should be looking at investments other than Bitcoin, to be honest.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:33:27




The answer's right in front of you. You could try emailing the support team, but chances are they're pretty swamped with emails right now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:38:27
You want reassurance of what? You think someone on reddit can see into the future?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:04
The same way you earn any $50. It's not any easier to earn Bitcoins than USD or any other currency.
@_date: 2013-02-24 07:36:39
I would promise to spend it on goods, to support the future of Bitcoins as a currency.

I'm no expert, but it seems like all your funds ended up on this address: 
Not sure who owns it, though.

Simple answer: if it was easy/riskless arbitrage, it wouldn't exist.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:11
While I'm a huge supporter of BTC, this is just misleading. Neither you nor I know how BTC prices will move.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:19:54
That's still a loss, mathematically. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:06:36
I feel ya. Not too long ago, I also had to reformat my laptop after a fatal error. In my frenzy to get my laptop functional (I'm a student, and usually rushed for assignment deadlines), I only picked out certain files, namely my academic stuff, to backup.
Lost 3 BTC on that reformat. You live and you learn, man :(
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:41:16
Are you looking to buy or hold?
Either way, you should move your coins off of Coinbase and into a local wallet first, before moving on to the next step.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:33:49
Not true. When I bought 10 for $30 USD/BTC about a year back, they cancelled and wouldn't honor my order. Instead they whitelisted me and sent me a "gift" of about $5 in BTC.
The price had only gone up to around $40 at the time of cancellation. Was not satisfied.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:20:30
Maybe because they have better things to do with their servers? Like, I don't know.. run their businesses?
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:59:54
Wow, Coinbase is a business providing us with a convenient service, and in order to keep running, they need to make profits? WTF?
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:47:16
First of all, the article is old news, not sure why this blogger had the need to repost.
Also, extremely unlikely to be true:

For what it's worth, there's also a chance of you and all your living relatives being struck by lightning at the same exact moment, too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:23:57
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:53:25
Yup, I specifically asked, and they responded by basically saying: sorry they could not fulfill my order, here's a consolation $5 in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:38:07
What the hell? Even if your solution was exactly what he was looking for, it's creepy as fuck how you, a stranger on the Internet, are so eager to video chat with this guy's parents. I would say no in his situation too.

How much of a moron can you be, really?

If the siteowners' identities were found, I think copyright infringement is the least of their worries lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:46:53
Are you in the US? If so, the easiest way is probably by sending it to Coinbase, then selling it for USD from there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:54:09
What's your history like with Coinbase? How many times and for what amounts have you placed orders with them in the past? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:19:57
If you don't believe it'll go higher, cash out. Otherwise, don't.
Not sure what it is you want us to convince you about.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:03:41
No, you agreed to sell at $464 when you clicked "Sell." Nothing about that is investigation-worthy. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:53:12








@_date: 2013-11-19 19:04:35


No, that is utterly wrong. Arbitrage opportunities cease to exist if they can be easily capitalized on, because people DO capitalize on them and drive prices to equilibrium.
In this case, I'm assuming the exchange between Chinese RMB and USD, logistic problems of the various exchanges (Coinbase, BTC China, etc), along with the volatility of BTC/USD create too much risk for this to be viable.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:57:47
Why do you even care about the past? It happened, there is no time travel, there is no changing the past. Focus on your investment strategies for the future.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:49:52
Why am I an ass for not giving a shit about a random stranger's student loans? Get the hell out of here.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:23:05
Literally nothing is stopping you from doing that.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:44:06
Maybe you should get a real job and spend 7 hours on that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:33:56
Don't you think this will affect scalability? With a larger amount of customers will come a larger amount of chargebacks, and this will become unmanageable.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:21:08
Coinbase does have an instant buy option, but you need to verify your identity and have a valid credit (not debit) card on file.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:42:57
I'm not sure what your question is. Can you explain to me what you think the value of gold is?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:12:29
What does the "generate_bitcoin_keypair" function do in your pseudocode?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:20:20
Sounds like a great idea!
Starting a referral train here, if anyone wants to be my referral :D
 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:47:58
How is this related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:08:18
How is this hedging BTC? This looks like a no-hedge strategy to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:58:05
If it was easy to do, the arbitrage opportunity wouldn't exist. The fact that it even exists means the cost of executing on this arbitrage opp is more expensive (either logistically or monetarily) than the benefit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:49:21


@_date: 2013-03-07 22:19:48
It's not rigged.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:37:53
I'd be interested in some BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:10:13
Has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:35:58
Actually, once you deposit your money into a large commercial bank like BoA, it's legally their money.
