Do some searches on this subreddit with these terms and come to your own conclusion. The _very_ short answer is that increasing the block size to that degree *drastically* heightens node centralization and threatens the main aspect of bitcoin that makes it useful. 


This is not necessary. Segwit is already implemented and deployed successfully, granting a block size increase in a way that does not harm decentralization. Those who are not using it (services especially) are doing so purposefully.

This is the most bullshit thing that I see touted around here. The fact it was created first really has no bearing on why bitcoin is the 'most successful' today. It has _the most_ competent devs in the space contributing to it, adding features and fixing bugs, driving innovation.

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:05


No, you don't. You can pay a reasonable fee and get it included reasonably quickly. 
I don't know if coinbase allows you set the fee you want however. You see, they are actually gaining by the fees being so high so it is in their interest to do this. Perhaps you now see why people warn others to move off coinbase...
Move your coins to a decent wallet that you (and **only** you) control the keys to and you can do whatever you want.

Please, do NOT support Let's Talk Bitcoin! in any way shape or form.
They are anti-bitcoin: The people running it have championed support for ALL of the altcoin forks (yes, all of them...) that tried to wrassle control of bitcoin: XT, unlimited, 2x and recently bcash
Pasting from my comment below:
Yes. I will give in that I am a big fan of andreas - I still cannot figure out why he associates himself with that group of people. I don't even always disagree with them, but I think it's obvious the intentions behind them, and I for one will not support them
 - thread discussing the CEO of tokenly (and others at the company) basically declaring bitcoin dead on their podcast because they're not rich yet (after backing XT and then Classic). the thread also talks about and provides proof of them buying views/clicks for their podcast (and thus scamming their investors and sponsors)
I think they may be in the process of a whitewash, as I am having a hard time finding any of the old posts (their forum at letstalkbitcoin.com/forum/ just 404s now...), but I found one of the links:
 (you can read bits of the post, which was made by an admin, through putting it into google) and its associated reddit thread:

i'm not writing off anyone who has been on the show (such as yourself) and I like andreas as much as the next (actual) bitcoiner, but the people who are **profiting** off of the website are anti bitcoin and as such should not be supported.

I am really sick of people defending this. I mean, I get why you're doing it Eric as you also own a business in the area and conduct similar practices.
But that does NOT make it acceptable. Your line of reasoning is equivalent to the "I have nothing to hide" argument. No, people should not just give up their privacy to coinbase because coinbase "has to" do what they do (even though, as you say, they really don't *have to*, they go **way** above and beyond). Bitcoin is supposed to free us from this shit.

This means absolutely nothing and you're just trying to deflect from the shitty choices the "dev" team behind your altcoin make.

yeah don't bother with let's talk Bitcoin - there is no useful discussions going on over there and they are run by people who aren't really competent at much.
another reason to avoid them is that they are anti-core, mostly because it fits their business model, first supporting XT and then Classic and now BU. most of their staff post _only_ in the other sub if they do publicly at all, they avoid this place because it pushes the truth
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:29:27

They will invade your privacy until they have something on you. They *will* probe you for more personal information (_if you're lucky!_) and that probably won't be enough to get your money back. Don't be complicit man, stand up for yourself.

I'd stay away from anything Tokenly related due to their shady past (scamming investors/sponsors, opposing core at all costs and backing XT/Classic/BU, releasing buggy PHP crapware they charge you to use, censoring people after crying censorship, etc.) - look into them for yourself.

Anyone can just visit the tokenly github and review all of the related problems for themselves with your crapware. Similarly, anyone can visit your comment history and look at your trolling of Core and support of anything that is not (in spite of obvious technical flaws) and realize that same sentiment is shared by your company, otherwise they would let your obviously incompetent sorry ass go.

No. You cannot "have" coins that are not displayed on a block explorer (unless there's something wrong with the explorer). It sounds like someone is trying to scam you or your friend.
If the seller is in possession of the coins, he should be able to provide you an address that you can check on an explorer to see the balance. There is no such thing as "offline stored" bitcoins that magically leave the blockchain.

They are a stain on the Bitcoin community, championing for larger blocks in the worst crowd possible, backing first XT and then Classic. Not one person at LTB has the technical knowledge to speak on cryptocurrency; Not one person at Tokenly has the technical knowledge to be busying themselves with cryptocurrency applications. I also concur that they are scamming their sponsors and investors.

He didn't say it's your fault, he said you'd be complicit. And I agree.
The point is this: Coinbase founded a business. Why? To make money. Bottom line, they wanted to make money. In order to make money, they have voluntarily become everything that bitcoin was designed to stop (e.g. banksters). They are now blaming the government for this.
The reality is Coinbase and Brian Armstrong sold themselves out, and have no problem destroying everything bitcoin is to get more money. People like to claim that we wouldn't be where we are without coinbase, but that is simply not true. Anyone who wouldn't have gotten into bitcoin if coinbase didn't exist is literally meaningless to the system as a whole.

Segwit2x was an attempt, just like bch, XT, et al to wrassle control of bitcoin. There was never a need to include the 2MB block size upgrade, and the fact you _supported_ that alone is enough for most people.
You failed, and the real bitcoin users will never forget that. You shouldn't have looked a gift horse in the mouth you stupid, stupid man. 
Go have a chat with the people who rule you, maybe you can feel a bit better in the short term.

It doesn't look like it... the only thing I see is their shitty challenge where they charge double for the product.
Can you link me to a gift card on cryptonize.it that will accept 0conf payments? I would absolutely love to wreck them.

If you're going to make a claim, provide evidence.


Start thinking for yourself...

That's the entirety of Let's Talk Bitcoin for you -- this podcast fits right in with the people running that website (who are huge BU [etc.] supporters)

This really seems like an attempt to deflect attention away from his (third) attempt to force his "spam filter" down the throats of Gentoo users: [
The timing of it all is too good, and the stupidness of it is just right. I bet he's hoping enough attention isn't called to his gentoo debacle that he doesn't have to issue another embarassing public apology which he obviously doesn't mean.

It's very amusing to me -- whether you realize it or not -- that you are attempting to use the exact same argument against me.
I am very aware that more life means more experiences (because as you say, opportunities arise over time). 
However, the people that are attempting to use this stance that "oh, you're just not old enough to realize how the world *really* works, come back to me in 20 years junior!"  against a valid argument are, in my eyes, fools. It is **not** a valid argument, it's simply sidestepping addressing the real issue in some vague attempt to make themselves feel superior by using this ridiculous tactic.


Not that it's any of your business, but I am 41 years old. Do you still think that I will "grow out of my condition"? (how ridiculous...)
You can continue to delude yourself into thinking that you're better for being around longer than other people. But that's all you're doing -- deluding yourself.

So there is literally noone selling anything at face value for 0conf then, right? Ask yourself why that is.
That's not a very good challenge as they are disincentivizing double spends by charging double what the product is worth! I can't say I'm surprised from that community, but this proves literally nothing. Do I need to charge double the value for all of my products if I don't want to be double spent on?
The minute someone sells anything of value and accepts 0conf transactions there will be double spends. This isn't a problem, and it works the same on both bitcoin and bch.

I love all of the arrogant seniors in here who think they're better because they're older. This is *exactly* why I do not "have respect for my elders" by default -- because most of them are just as ignorant as the 20 year old ditz I don't respect for similar reasons.
You are not better than anyone else because you are older. And using that as an argument against the (valid) points someone brings up makes you look foolish in all but the brainwashed masses eyes.

Here's the thing about blind trust: you are guilty of it.
The evidence was so shaky on any sort of hitmen charges that it was NOT brought against him and he was NOT found guilty of anything of that sort. 
Provide any proof otherwise. 
If you cannot, you should seriously consider why you feel it is acceptable to trust blindly what the government says when in fact there is evidence to the contrary. Do your research before claiming something as fact otherwise you will just be regarded as a shill or troll.
