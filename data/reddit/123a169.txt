You are mistaken. Paper wallets are the same as digital wallets. You can deposit and withdraw as you wish. The main difference is that paper wallets only have 1 address but digital ones may have many.

Except it doesn't rely on blind faith. Bitcoin fixes the underlying issue of the whole global financial system, reliance on a third party. Companies cheat their customers and go bankrupt all the time. Bitcoin removes that risk.

Funny how you think any critic of Maduro is after oil. He is a dictator and should never have been elected.
Also its amazing that Venezuela fixed the problem of voter fraud! Please enlighten me on how you did that? Oh wait, the election itself was fraudulent.

Go back to hurting innocents Maduro.

This is a good day for Canada and therefore the world.

What are you even refering to? I didn't even mention the US or taxes. To challenge your point though, there are several non-US cities/municipalities accepting Bitcoin for tax payments. However, even if they force you to pay in whatever fiat, there is nothing stopping someone from storing their currency in Bitcoin and just transferring to fiat when needed.
And you didn't answer my question so I will ask again, why do you hate Bitcoin?

Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of mass protest and a dying country due to an insane man that hates his country and the people that live there. Maduro is a criminal and that is a fact.

Just pay via etransfer

A 100-millionth of a Bitcoin.

Again with the assumptions. I am not a US citizen. I'm glad that the only ones supporting Maduro are idiots like you.

Why do you hate Bitcoin? The technology behind it fixes fatal flaws in the current financial system that it is like jumping from radio to the internet.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:52:25
Lol there is only one way to fix that.

The American Dollar is used for all of those things plus more at scales incomparable to bitcoin. Get a better argument.

I agree. It's a shitty situation. I put it down to complacency though. Once they buy Bitcoin they see it in 'their' wallet forgetting the whole 'not your keys' mantra. 
I make sure to move my Bitcoin the moment I buy it and always triple check the recipient address. Can never be too careful.

Bitcoin and bcash are both cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is ALSO a project and Bitcoin core is a wallet. Stop trying to deceive people by needlessly complicating things. BTC is Bitcoin BCH is Bitcoin cash and they operate on different versions of the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:21:07
Did you really forget cash exists?

Unrelated but if you are in Canada I highly recommend shakepay (the company that tweeted this). They have probably the best service for buying bitcoins in Canada. They do have KYC though.

Bitcoin is both singular and plural. Like when you refer to yen. You don't say 2000 yens.

The currency. The plural version of the protocol is 'The Bitcoin Protocols'. Not that there are more than one.

All it takes is a few seconds. Any time spent using a custodial wallet is a risk no matter how long.
