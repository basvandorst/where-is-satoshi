What you're referring to sounds like what BTG or ZCash did. Lumen isn't "premined" in that sense as it's not mined at all. It's distributed. It's a lot more fair then you're giving it credit for, they only keep 5% of it for operations costs which they're transparent about. Not really greed driven at all, which is why it's getting so much traction.

The number of lightning channels opening up in the next few weeks is probably going to be overwhelming. I love it.

Pre-mined but open to nodes joining. Less centralized than other pre-mined at least.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:11:56
XLM may be pre-mined but it allows nodes to join. Also the foundation operates on the same principals as the linux foundation so not something unheard of.

To imply that Venezuela didn't is insulting. They were at best a few generations behind a country like yours when foreign interests stepped in and started fucking everything up. I'm sure you're not from one of the "1st world" countries that stepped in and helped fuck their economy back to the stone age but who knows, you weren't personally responsible for any of it.

Getting robbed is getting robbed. That's what Roger Ver, Bitcoin.com and BitCash have done. They robbed people.

There wasn't a movie called Jason for a really long time. Before that they were all Friday the 13th. Much like Freddy Kruger didn't have a movie named after him either. That was Nightmare on Elm Street...

They said it was due to complaints about high transaction fees. They will very likely be an early adopter of a successfully implemented layer two component like lightning or maybe they'll partner with a payment network like SatoshiPay/OMG etc...

Right now you only save if you're batching as far as I'm aware.

If your wife has just been HODLing this whole time, pay off the loans. You don't lucky breaks like this. 
If she's been day trading and working at it on the other hand, she needs to treat the current value of the account as the principal and set aside her trading profits to pay off the loan.  That way your principal doesn't shrink and she starts paying off her loans!

Exchanges need to adopt segwit to make use of mass savings via batching. This would have a secondary effect of helping reduce network congestion, lowering fees for everyone.

It doesn't "need it" but overall it's a good thing for it. The more ways for people to get other currencies converted to or represented by bitcoin, the better.
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:40:38
The sad fact is I've spent my entire day trying to get this one bitcoin and have gotten absolutely no where. I'm pretty sure it has to do with rotating the image but this has gone from entertaining and challenging to depressing and desperate. If I could put the same amount of effort into finding a job... Keeping up with crypto is killing me, I can't keep doing this.

Reported as spam on Google as well.
They used that site to convince tons of unknowing new users to invest in the wrong currency and sold all of their own stake at a massive profit. If this was regulated, they'd be in jail.
To elaborate further, it's spam. It's BITCOIN.COM and they don't even promote BITCOIN
  it's amazing.

Considering he founded PayPal I bet Elon is preferential to Stellar Lumens personally. Kind of a longshot but he would look at what solutions does the technology solve. In that sense, BTC is just not ever really going to make it. It uses WAY too much energy to mine.

Yes we can, I don't day trade with my full portfolio, that would be ridiculous. I'm not trying to make $100,000 a day. You only need a few bitcoins to make a good solid daily profit with conservative trades.

Yeah but... I mean seriously... it's being premined right now... it's dead. Just forget about it.

Miners hope and pray they get to hold onto a currency to let it appreciate but they have hardware expenses, electricity, rent, heat management. They usually already know where the next 100 BTC they mine is being spent and they are really relying on profitability each month as opposed to a long term saving plan. If BTC's value drops while the profiability goes down, they're almost forced to change currencies.

I like it, I've used this system for quite a while now (not my own, have heard about it from multiple sources over the years)
1.0000 0000 = BTC (bitcoin)
0.0001 0000 = mBTC (millibit)
0.0000 0001 = SAT (satoshi)

Are you using a GPU? You should look into mining ZCash and selling it for BTC as soon as you're payed out. That should bump your profitability by like... 2000%

I read through everything and this comment is the one that is correct. I just did a quick review of the last 5 withdrawal's I made from bittrex.com and they all came from different wallets with all sorts of transaction histories. Just in case you are concerned that the amount changed, screenshot things before you continue next time. I don't think you are at fault, did anything wrong or lost any money this time around.
