Agree that tipping amount is not always proportional.  See:

I thought that for awhile when I was new to reddit.  I was surprised how cruel people were to each other.  So naive.

Nice to know about the possible bank transfer option.  Thanks!

I watched it twice.  It sounds like you live in a Carl Hiaasen novel: Legal to ask for money but illegal to step out into the street and take it.  Crazy times.  I thought it was interesting that you use gyft to feed hungry people.  Real purpose there instead of just entertainment for apathetic techno-dweebs like me. I think you are the only person I've hear drop the F bomb and use the words "teach the gospel" within a few minutes. (Technically the F bomb was in quotes.)  Today I donated a small amount from Coinbase.  Coinbase has a reoccurring payment feature that I'll use to send something to you monthly.  I should really donate closer to where I live but Alpha Project doesn't take bitcoin so they lost out to you.  You are a hero.  Thank You!

Um - not quite the same.  Less money but more polite.
