*Person*: How many Bitcoins do you have
*You*: "Not enough"
*Person*: "I get it but like, how many?"
*You*: "Not enough"
*Person*: "Like .5? Or like 100? How many?"
*You*: "I own approximately Not enough"

Bitcoin has more uses than just a store of value or transfer of currency. You'll be able to tie proof of ownership to bitcoins in the future. Hell, we may even vote in bitcoin. Who knows, technology is still pretty young

Yes? Yes, profitable 
No? No,  unprofitable

Okay I get it! Meme lives on lol

Go on YouTube and research. The more you learn about cryptocurrencies the more(or less) confident you'll become on investing your money. Then you won't need to ask and will sleep better at night 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:35:28
At they very least, $3.50
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:02:39
At least 6

I'd sell ~$20b for 100k BTC!!! (12.17.2017)
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:37:16
Explain to me what "all of it" is then because I'm yet to see that. Bitcoin is the token to cores blockchain, without the reward there would be no point to mine blocks. You cant have the blockchain without its token. 
Based on your past posts im pretty convinced you're another sock puppet for bch. And saying BTC isnt bitcoin anymore? I'll make sure to stay far far away from whatever you're reading.
Sorry you bought in to a fraud though, there is still hope. Maybe you can just increase your brain capacity by 8mb or some lazy fix like that. Easy right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:39
I split up my sells under 10k each so we shall see
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:03:06
I sold half my coins today  as a way to hedge the btc/bch drama

Bitmain makes the antminer to mine bitcoin, however they only receive payment in bitcoin cash. I o my have btc and usd
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:44
The thing is, if bitcoin drops people buy more of it since they know it is this REAL bitcoin with a solid core dev team.. while bitcoin cash has a 1 man dev team and the lazy block size fix to today's problems. 
Bitcoin layer 2 and LN is going to make bitcoin cash look like an 80s Buick in today's standards as far as cryptocurrency efficiency and practicallity goes. There's literally no comparison of the two.
If you buy into btc because of its price, you probably don't care about the technology too much. If you TRANSFER WEALTH to btc for its technology, you won't care about price too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:12:50
I have not set up the bitcoin merchant service yet, so unfortunately not YET. But no currently

I just wanted bch to buy the antminer to mine btc, I am in NO WAY converting all my btc holding for bitcoin c(r)ash
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:13:09
You're welcome? I don't see what you're trying to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:10:48
It shows BTC's resistance to corporate shenanigans and strength of the economic majority to deflect such attacks (because thats what they are). They(b2x) knew they would lose a ton of money in their attempt to try and hijack bitcoin. 
This is super bullish for bitcoin. 
Can't wait to see what the market does when the other side of the world wakes up!
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:14:50
Everything in the known universe is either a bitcoin, or not a bitcoin.

I'm showing my store to different people throughout today only.
 I guess I'm sorry you feel that way, BUT my first sale came from an earlier post.. so your comment is false. Negative Nancy

I fucking love moon math.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:57:08
Basically, no one knows. But THEORETICALLY it could be in the hundred thousands if not, millions per BTC in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:56:09
Because 8000 plus 532.95 = 8532.95
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:18:57
No you
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:42:56
So if I'm not mistaken it's s2x crash, then to $10k and beyond?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:24:26
Not until it's in the hundreds of thousands or million(s)

Oh the arrival date is supposed to be Nov. 14, Fork is ~Nov. 16
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:32:47
I would get my BTC off of their as soon as possible and moved into a hardware wallet. Trezor or Ledger
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:01:11
You could find a reputable seller on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:16:22
Okay, I'll stick to that. But how else will we get the s9 once the secondhand market runs out of them? We will be forced to buy direct from bitmain? Something I'm genuinely concerned about
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:42:44
He can charge back on his account so I would pay very close attention to that
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:24:38
Because selling bitcoin related products is such a disservice. Jeez throw me in jail already 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:40:20
Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Thank you Bitcoin community for being excellent supporters! :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:32:30
Yeah youre totally right. I'm holding my btc, thanks for setting me straight lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:01:49
And then bitcoin fucking EXPLODES in value. They would not want to do this
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:53:42
I'll be conservative and say $700 per month. It's. Better than $0 a month. I don't get your point 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:55:39
Bitcoin clash
Bitcoin crash
Shitcoin cash
Bitfake stash
Any is appropriate 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:11:58
So assuming I never cash out my btc, do I have to report unrealized gains?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:30:49
Sounds like you're worried
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:48:01
I meant moon for btc
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:33:49
You haven't lost anything till you've sold. You are still holding "x" amount of bitcoins. Don't be emotional
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:52:58
2 miners would yield $1000~ per month. Each s9 will cost $1500
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:49:31
You seem a little worried
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:20:24
Maybe. Maybe Not.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:37:46
What is this, game of thrones? You mean, let rich guys devise a plan to hijack thr name bitcoin and make it SEEM like the market is making a decision. And then have as many sheep follow (you probably)

I guess I'm the misinformed one, thought you could sell or send both on accident rather than just replay attacks on the sending only.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:43:36
Seriously, get a Trezor or Ledger 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:16:14
Probably sold at $100 and can't forget about it
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:49:02
That's seriously awesome man! People don't understand the use for bitcoin but when they do they are seriously enlightened lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:09:26
I'd be pulling my hair out. Better find that seed somewhere or put in every password you could possibly remember
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:39:25
I was looking more along the lines of the technology behind bitcoin selling itself to them. But I too like that idea as well. Not just strictly pushing its price though, if you get me.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:17:16
Go read the top threads on /bitcoin pls
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:12:59
Cool, where can i get one?

Bitcoin may be a "bubble", but it really would be an opportunity to buy more if it did indeed pop, because money badger has died many times, time and time again, and still doesn't give a shit.

Which mine pools should I look after? I'm unfamiliar with bitcoin mine pools so maybe you can point me in the right direction
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:32:54
It will become a point where you won't even want to "cash out" and would rather have day to day transactions in Bitcoin. You earn in bitcoin and lose in bitcoin.

She is now your fiance, amirite? 
Seriously though, tell everyone you care about (and I guess don't care about) of bitcoin. It's the future.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:36:11
How much more profitable would it be mining the alt coins? I assume it takes far less power if that is really an option. I will look into Nicehash, can't say I've heard of it.
Again, I'm a total noob to the mining game. Anything else you might be able to let me and anyone else reading this know of? 
So far, I understood unless I'm putting like 5 figures up for a mining rig it's totally not worth it :(
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:32:13
Banks want to centralize blockchain technology, which is fundamentally supposed to be decentralized. Theyd control inflation, the supply, the distribution. Everything blockchain isn't supposed to be basically. 
It might not entirely replace fiat, but the characteristics of BTC as a store of value far outweigh those of a number punched in the computers by a bank. 
This is why bitcoin will not crumble. Ever. Only forward from here. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:30:43
As long as the address was your own, your bitcoin should be safe
