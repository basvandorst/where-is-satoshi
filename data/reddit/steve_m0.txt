I believe those are CSW, he was going to wait till late Nov but when he could not continue the FUD of BCH fork/split this weekend and gave up, he is now starting to use his BTC stash to buy BCH.

What is that, someone who asks questions and looks for evidence to support if a statement is true or false?  Why exactly do u believe what you believe?
A) it is based upon the evidence you found from researching a subject
B) someone told you what to believe
Think about it.

Not sure your calculation of how much $$$ is needed to move to certain price is accurate.  MktCap=123B. Supply of 17.7M. That does NOT equate to 123B has been invested into BTC.  Once serious buying starts, supply will dry up making price skyrocket.
