My problem is I'm genuinely not knowledgeable enough to take the risk of moving it from their wallet to mine. 
I'm in the process of learning but I couldn't wait until I was 100% literate to get involved and I'm so thankful I didn't wait.
I'm worried about which wallet to use, which app which phone to put it on, whether or not to get a hardware wallet. I'm just not prepared to put the risk on myself yet.

I am, I know about the phrases but like I said I'm in the process of educating myself on these topics.

I have .2, been buying since ~$4000 mark. I know I'm new to it but I spent about six months lurking and learning here before I went in. I regret not buying sooner obviously, but at least I went in knowing not to think of this in the short term. I'll continue to buy with everything I can afford to spare

But how fucked am I then if that gets damaged or corrupted?

Man ripple has broken my heart, I have been waiting for a week to be verified to buy on bitstamp and it's nigh triple the price I first tried it at. I'm still going to go in but no way I'm going to get 500 coints for ~€300

I fucked up, I don't have any wallet besides coinbase because I'm new to this and when I heard the fork was cancelled I stopped looking into my own wallet. Now I'm frozen.
Apparently I will soon have two sets of coins, is that a thing that happens or will I have to choose which one I go forward with?

I'm only about a grand into my investing, I started at around $4000 but my last push was chatting about it here and getting told I can trade in up .00000001 of a BTC. I knew you could divide it but I didn't realise how small you could go with it.

Do you have to pay fees to transfer to your wallet?

Ah dude that's awesome I love them notes. I was in Zim last year and the poor people sell them to tourists for the novelty, I have a few billion in my drawer.
I'd be happy to give you them for half of what you paid initially ��

Hey man! I'm a relative newbie, I've been buying for a few months. I was always worried about moving it off coinbase, could you suggest any resources?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:25:01
You must have some left totske advantage ofthe jump?
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:31:34
Would you have a link on how to start doing this? It sound like a small but not insignificant payout
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:57:21
Is it a difficult process? Is it still viable?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:00:10
Man I only started looking into this shit really recently. I put like 50 in coinbase and now this shit is happening and I feel like it's a pop quiz I'm unprepared for.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:54:28
Genuinely as a new guy to this who is about to drop serious cash, should I not use coin base?
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:07:07
Oh shit sorry yeah I wasn't paying attention to that, yes it's euro.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:57:59
I'm new to this, I'm looking on coinbase and it's showing it as 3700 and change.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:09:56
Oh shit it's that labour intensive? I was under the impression it'd be more viable now because the 12.5 bitcoins allotted is worth far more.
