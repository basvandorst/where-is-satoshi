is tradingview a decent place to get an overall accurate view of relative trading volume? looking at the 1 year, average daily seems to be slowly climbing

A couple of things: 
Anyone know when lightning labs android wallet gets out of beta? 
Can you tip BTC using lntips outside of this subreddit?
from lightning labs:
"Thanks for your interest in becoming a tester for the Lightning: Fast Bitcoin Wallet app. However, at this time, Lightning: Fast Bitcoin Wallet app's testing program has reached the maximum number of testers that can participate in it and isn't accepting any more testers."
After seeing this LNTIP thing going on I want to get in... I wanna start tipping.  
edit: Not sure if I'm just dreaming or not but I started visualizing some of the reddit readers getting really interested after seeing the tips popping in and discovering how LN is getting easier to use and super cheap. 50 bucks could translate into a LOT of tips

first and foremost, thank you :)   I'll give eclair a shot.. 
have you or anyone else had experience in working on getting subreddit mods to activate the bot on other subs? I guess I"m curious as to how receptive they might be to this..

hey I've got some questions... 
I'm looking for data regarding amount of Bitcoin on exchanges - can anyone point me in the right direction?. 
Are there any exchanges that don't "rent" out BTC to short sellers? For the ones that do, is there any data on what they charge the borrower (ie. 8%)? 
Is there any scenario at present where it is possible that someone with enough money could short the market with more BTC than are in existence? From what I understand any approval of a BTC paper could lead to this scenario (where there could for example, be a short using 30million BTC in a 21million BTC market)

I'm getting an itchy feeling like these are the last couple hours before we pop over 10K for good.

Happened a couple months ago in Wasaga Beach too. Fools paid like over $9000.00 on top of the ransom to a "consultant" to make the payment too.

Canadian here ... I bought some BTC using Shakepay (google android) since RBC wouldn't let me send $$ to QuadrigaCX anymore.  I did it a couple days ago and it took me 15minutes to download, register, email money to shakepay then buy BTC.

get ready for FOMO.. my bitcoin podcast downloads just doubled today

thank you for posting this.

hmm maybe the note was left intentionally.. ahh they're playin me!

not saying I know much, but got looking into "stock to flow" (S2F) lately. 
not saying it is something guaranteed but nonetheless compellling.
when you look into S2F and also look into Saifedean Ammous where he brings up the point that capital flows to the hardest assets - well I thought it interesting.  He has done a couple podcasts, etc - one I listed to was a podcast called "Tales from the Crypt" episode 33.
If I had to guess, I'd say BTC value is quite accurate right now, with S2F charts predicting 50K to 100K once scarcity increases in 2020 and on and on.

hey guys I got a peak at the whale notes while cleaning lunch tables at the 4 seasons yesterday.. here is what it said
-pop it up to about 100,000 or so by Christmas 
-tank it early summer 2020 down to 20,000 then pay the media to declare the 2020 Bitcoin crash
-wait until October 2020 to take it up to 50k
-meet with Soros Nov. 2020 for next detailed instructions
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:16:38
little bits each month is my advise - this is known as "dollar cost averaging" (DCA).   DCA smooths out the bumps and removes the scenario where you may wind up buying in at a peak then feeling like crap if it drops significantly..  if you think its going to moon well then I guess buying it all at once is best but sometimes this can become a trap. whatever you choose to do, please don't put in more than you can afford to lose - as unlikely as it could be, this market can really put the squeeze on you sometimes.

Bitcoin and Friends on youtube - anyone know when episode 3 comes out? I'm addicted.
edit: found out. Aug 17th
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:19:45
feelin like the BTC train be leaving the station soon.. just not sure if it is 8K or 16k. watching bitfink on tradingview is sure entertaining though.. man what a gem to watch
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:33:30
I put a big calendar on the floor then asked my dog what she thought. She knowingly pointed her nose to Nov 2020 so yeah, I'm going with that.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:37:12
ok, thank you :)
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:57:32
no judgement here but in my opinion, it is almost always a good thing to spread out your risk. XRP and BTC are VERY different and if one fails completely but the other goes up 1000%... well, you know, spread out the risk and increase your odds of overall profit long term.
I also recommend that you look at "stock to flow ratio".
@_date: 2019-08-27 15:51:24
Hey dude, nice work! keep at it - this sub can sometimes be lacking when it comes to encouragement in things such as this and just want to say that projects like this are what help spread the word :)
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:53:43
on the sidebar there is a link to "how to buy bitcoins worldwide".  
link: [
basically you need to use an exchange or find someone to buy it from. Just make sure you know what you are buying - especially in the bitcoin space as the cryptocurrency Bcash sometimes calls itself bitcoin - it has caused a lot of grief with some new buyers as they found that they didn't buy what they thought they bought.
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:52:39
Feels like the train is leaving the station imminently - question is whether its heading north or south :)

ok, I have a dumb question but here goes.. 
why is tradingview volume so low compared to coinmarketcap? is the tradingview volume specific to one exchange - their own maybe? hell I don't know and feel kinda dumb for asking but oh well

!lntip 100
... I wonder if this will work.. ?
edit: is there a way to make the lntip bot comment disappear (to keep things comment section cleaner) ?
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:43:40
woke up today feelin really bullish. got an itchy feeling we will be seeing a BGD. for whatever reason, I think that those who want to supress BTC have run out of BTC to short.... could be wrong here but my expectation is some price popping
edit: I just upvoted all commenters on the daily - a little positivity for all you f*ckers :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:23:42
why do you think its due to crash? I see an easy 10 to 14% annual index growth for al least the next 2 years. I mean seriously, US just lowered business taxes in a huge way, the economy is seriously rolling hard right now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:20:06
maybe - I'm neutral on this but Tone Vays called this bottom and feels like he has quite a few followers... enough to possibly get some bullish momentum goin
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:16:13
:) 
don't get me wrong, I'm all for some Bitcoin bullishness.  do you think this is a stock crash or a correction?  S&amp;P is where it was 2 months ago.. almost mirroring Bitcoin.  time will tell if you are right but US business friendly tax breaks are very bullish sign (IMO) going forward. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:34:48
wouldn't it be typical of BTC to just start going up from here when so many are expecting a touch of the 21 EMA or even a drop into 8k or so?
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:43:20
ah didn't know about the selling - that is good info, thank you.  fyi someone on reddit mentioned a while back that Shakepay might not be the best app to hold significant BTC on - advice was to transfer the BTC elsewhere once you bought it.
@_date: 2018-07-05 15:07:50
I used Shakepay. downloaded the app on android, set it up (15 mins) 
went to my bank online, emailed money to Shakepay (it gives you the email information you need in the Shakepay app) and about 1/2 hour later the emailed money was showing in the shakepay app. I bought btc with the $$ and was done within one hour of starting. 
not sure if relevant, I reside in Canada

further to this, I'd say that miner hoarding may not be as severe either. I read somewhere that Bitmain sold off approx. 50,000 BTC during the crazy 2017 time - apparently they had about 20,000 BTC left - stated in docs for their IPO
with bigger hashrate, expense to run is high - to some degree you could infer that miners would not be able to hoard as high a percentage as in the past. However, this may be offset due to more institutional mining as I'd assume they could hoard more easily.
TLDR: miner hoarding requires deep pockets and there just might not be as much hoarding as has been seen historically
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:50:43
could be the dump before the breakout pump... or just more dumping...
edit: apparently Powell Fed talk is the driver of this..?
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:43:41
could be a decent chance... I can almost feel the hordes of shorts jumping into new positions here
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:34:58
lots of this lately, so I just upvoted everyone in the thread :)

I've got a very large line of credit with Scotia and a smaller one with RBC.  After reading this, I'm thinking of leaving the LOC's running high as this possibly is preventing them from shutting me down ..? 
just to add - I think it's very disturbing that all major CAD banks are doing this. It really shows Banks are nobodys friend and they will do everything in their power to delay this flippening. I doubt anything will change until there is a class action against CAD banks but with limited population we could be years away from this.
