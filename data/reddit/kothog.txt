MtGox has been forced to operate in this manner for &gt; 1.5 years. This is old hat, old news. There have always been issues, there always will be issues, and 99% of them are basically completely out of MtGox' hands. What do you expect when banks can't even comprehend the nature of virtual user currencies let alone bitcoin? Welcome to the bleeding edge. Find the method that works for you with the least friction, and stop expecting everybody else to live up to your imaginary international banking standards.
(edit) Look, here's another person exactly like you, except his problem had to do with Intersango:   and he thought MtGox was The Shit. These problems are just going to happen. Period. What's the rush anyway? Why do you need coins Right Now? Like Right This Second? And It Can't Wait Until Tuesday?
(2nd edit) Okay, okay. Not *exactly* like you. I'm just trying to say people have issues with all the exchanges, all the time, and it's never been any different.

Nobody runs a 5970 at stock clocks.. :-(
Everything else you say is correct; I was comparing two 5970 running at full capacity, and overclocked, consuming about at much energy as the FPGA farm which could compete in terms of hashrate (and overall cost, BTW) to this ASIC miner. :-)

Mining companies who make gold bars aren't taxed just because they make gold bars. They are taxed when they sell the gold bars and realise the profit. Miners who "find" bitcoins it could be argued are doing something similar. Businesses who accept bitcoins as part of a transaction of course are engaging in trade.. but, just like a placer miner who finds valuable rocks in a stream, hoarding a bunch of valuable rocks shouldn't be taxed.

This will materially affect difficulty, if all 25 units come online at the stated time. Reward will be halved by then too, for sure. This will significantly concentrate mining hashrate into the hands of a small number of individuals who are 1) able to pay for it, and 2) able to pay for it. Note also you don't even have your own control panel. It's theirs. That means they have control of a unit you just paid $30k for.
Also, this is single-purpose. If SHA2 is ever broken, or you want the computing power for some other purpose, you can't. Also, by July 2012, the new FPGA types will be well in full swing. (So, another doubling of FPGA efficiency give or take, which reduces this thing's power advantage by a similar factor.)
They don't name the escrow third-party. There are very few non-incestuous bitcoin organizations, and I know of none who will escrow this much.
Say you can get new-form FPGA for this much, and assume new FPGA can do double the hashrate of the current.. say.. Icarus. 720MH/s for $x. You could afford about &gt;50GH/s for the same price as this thing is selling for.
So..  why bother? 100W, or 680W? Are your margins really going to be so thin that the power of *LESS* than two 5970 will make a dent in your long-term profit?
(edit) *EVEN IF* you spent $30k NOW on FPGA before the reward halving, you could get &gt; 25GH for exactly the same price. So..  like.. why?
(edit) My mistake: For some reason I thought this was 2011 still. Woops. But I'm right about the FPGA releases anyway.

You think you know so much about bitcoin buy/sell operations without downtime? Try building one. Or use one of the well-documented methods that have no wait periods. Or go to  Or find someone who's willing to sell to you in person. This sort of thing happens with every business that tries to interface with hundreds, or thousands of banks worldwide. Did they ever promise you a 1-2 day turnaround? No? Then why do you expect it?

Where, specifically, does it say this? Which paragraph?

There's a problem with that. People can become desperate to fill their lives with meaning, and the desperation makes them miserable.
They rush from place to place to place. Contentment in my experience does not seem to come from an insatiable appetite for the life you're describing. I haven't figured out yet where it does come from, but I've seen a lot of really unhappy people whose days were literally filled with everything they could pack into them, every day, travelling, trips, eating, socializing, riding, biking, swimming, sports.. the works. And they were some of the most miserable people I've ever seen. Desperation doesn't begin to cover it.
I don't think filling your days is the answer. Unfortunately, I don't know what is. Calmness? Contentment? Finding some reason to shed the anxiety? I just don't know yet.

No because each singular Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal points.

Pretty simple really. You offer them an infinitely-scaled and variety of betting options, you pay some shills to go around and pretend they have a "system" or a "method" to make money on it, you generate lots of buzz, and then you go count your money.

No, all he needs to do is spend one of his blocks.
Or send an alert to the network (I believe his key still works.)
Or sign a message with his GnuPG key.
Or one of any number of things.

This is a lie. In fact hobbiests will "make" more money than professionals because they work for free and have little to no additional costs above equipment and power. This has always been the case: the only problem is the entry fee which can be steep if one picks by accident the wrong ASIC.
By the time txn fees are relevant we will all be dead. It is pointless to consider that.

The thieves specifically chopped into the ATM in order to access the USB port. So it wasn't just open and accessible via "a hole." The hole wasn't there before the thieves cut it.

No, that's not right. Hiding your wealth means you can't be the one to pick up the cheque at restaurants, when it really should be you who does. There is no such thing as hiding it perfectly. There is only hiding it until your best friends discover it. And what do they say when they discover that you've been letting their barely-afford-it selves pick up the sushi bills on double-date night?

Gambling.. winnings?! Are you able to declare appreciation on any item, virtual or not as gambling winnings? Just declare it as income, and don't try to play games; else, be prepared to have the tax authorities call your bluff, and rule against you.

This is ridiculous. They have the hashrate sitting right there. All they have to do is point it at a local attack daemon and they're done. Pointing their hashrate at the pools is a pointless gesture.

Actually, based on the amount of losses people are incurring, and coins destroyed, or coins being taken *out* of circulation by hoarders, seizures, or thefts, it could be argued that even from the perspective you think you're being clever about, the currency is still deflationary.

Don't bet in SatoshiDice. It is a distributed denial of service attack that tricks Bitcoin users into attacking their own Bitcoin instances (bloating the blockchain and eating up everyone hard drives in the process.)

"Success is a menace. It makes people think they can do no wrong."
It is an evil cognitive bias that humans must seek to break, to think that wealthy people are elevated because they are better humans.

The price is no longer outrunning the hashrate. The hashrate is now completely unassailable by conventional computing power in any meaningful collection. At this point, only people who have the power to kill bitcoin anyway, have the resources to custom-asic attack it. It's cheaper to kill it via laws, regulations, and personal (legal) attacks on the developers themselves than it is to kill it via the Satoshi 50%+1 attack avenue.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:45:57
The technology has already been leap-frogged. All these people jumping on the ASICMiner bandwagon who won't see hashrate for months.. all you're doing is helping ASICMiner pay off their NRE, and giving them money to compete with you using their own boards.
Yeah, good luck with that.
