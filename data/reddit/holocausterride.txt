You should compare - do a week of accepting bitcoin and a week of not and record your total profits. It might be that even accepting bitcoin in your food truck drew customers you wouldn't otherwise have had which could pay for the Bitcoin conversations.
I'm not sure giving up on an idea because it got your customers talking to you is necessarily smart. In the modern economy you have to treat customers as humans and not a money generating assembly line.

I think for the purposes of discussion the difference comes down to how many transactions per second the network can handle.

That's by design at this point, but there are alternative clients that miners can adopt if they disagree with this decision.

This argument could apply to any change that increases bitcoin network capacity though, including "on-chain" solutions. If you really want difficult to confirm transactions and a small block size as features we shouldn't try to implement hacked workarounds for them.

All of those things can change rapidly. Life has a way of disintegrating. Ideally you always want the resources on hand to fly to another country and sustain your life for a few months.  Buying some bitcoins helps with this too - they will likely appreciate immediately after a major crisis, and can be easily carried across borders.

Sure, but in these kinds of communications semantics are very important. Why not use the exact word? "Freely being able to discuss and critique every aspect of Bitcoin" definitely allows censorship based on the censor's standard of what is and is not considered Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a universal ledger. If Amazon data centres are a useless makeworky project then so is Bitcoin.
The author seems to be comparing Bitcoin to "natural forests and squirrels" which he claims are all gone already. Or biological evolution, which has also already been replaced.
What is the proposal to return to nature that is being proposed? How does this criticism exclusively refer to Bitcoin and not also to Gold, Fiat Currency, Air miles, and all other technology.
I understand that a Luddite would see Bitcoin as harmful.

So were hard forks designed from the start? Why don't you answer my questions instead of saying irrelevant opinions about my political views (personally I think it's better not to hard fork).
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:07:03
Ethereum has multiple implementations and dev teams and actively encourages them.
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:58:59
The reason I still respect other opinions on this matter is because of people like you who are trying to reduce a technical discussion into identity politics.
I haven't been able to have a discussion on this issue with anyone who opposes raising the block size without immediately being called a corporate shill or being accused of spreading disinformation for pointing out that Bitcoin was literally designed so that a majority of miners can decide to do whatever they want.
There is no central authority that says what is or is not acceptable development.
Rich people have just as much right to invest in and have a say in the future of Bitcoin as you do.

That's literally how it was designed to work.

Blatantly lying is not gaining you any points. In fact, such unashamed disinformation only strengthens the resolve against such propaganda. The people that pay for such propaganda are not happy when it is so unproductive. Better to give up and try elsewhere.

What can you do to prevent people from using the blockchain though?
@_date: 2016-06-27 12:14:11


Where did I say that? You aren't listening to me (my guess is because you already identified me as a "classiccoiner" and are now assuming I support their arguments). All I said was that the idea of hard forks is built into the system (and the block size was originally meant to be raised).


Do you support SegWit? How about Lightning Network? Do these hijack the mother project's resources?


Was [BIP 50](  a hard fork? Why does [bitcoin.org]( say there has never been a hard fork?
FYI - even Core team thinks hard forks are acceptable. "we do expect to make hard forks in the future."


Yeah, and some of them left and moved to other projects that "hijack" your resources.


Why do you think that shutting down opposing view points is convincing? Would I be more convincing if I spent most of my post accusing you of shilling and telling you to stop posting?
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:09:15

@_date: 2016-06-27 10:14:50

You are spamming the same message as shills on the other side though.
All I'm saying is that Bitcoin blockchain is whatever the miners say it is. How is that disinformation?
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:18:30
As long as the core developers focus on the core technology rather than add-ones we should be safe.

@_date: 2016-02-12 00:57:28

I actually think lightning network conceptually solves this problem and allows dynamic and fairly secure (I have a feeling there are security problems I haven't thought of) "sharding" of the blockchain.
It violates the idea of bitcoin being "trust less" though.

If the devs can't keep up with user requirements, users will switch to a faster network.
