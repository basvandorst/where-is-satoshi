You have a very distorted view of reality if you think fiat money is controlled by majority rules. 
I would go as far to say you likely don't understand why Bitcoin was created if you think fiat money is "democratic" money. 
Fiat money is controlled by a very very small group of experts around a round table at the Fed reserve.  It is not controlled by your congress or any democratically elected officials. 
If we aren't careful, Bitcoin can end up the same way with the same mass media brainwashing. 
We already have the group of experts and the round table part sorted.

and while we are on the topic of differences, currently there are about 10 votes you need to buy to own all the hash power on the network (give or take some flex given pool user slippage)
If you wanted to 'buy votes' of the nodes you have at least 4-6k nodes that you would need to buy, and have a good idea of the network topology in order to make sure that you could eclipse the blocks of your competitor.
Its quite a feat, akin to trying to successfully double spend

Also, keep in mind that nodes can only filter on block version. Not the miner that mined it. The point is not to allow for censorship. The point is to show preference/support for a particular consensus rule set (say one that allowed a bigger blocksize or a certain OP code etc)

Good paper. 
I believe they are right. Though perhaps we need not stop the propagation of blocks that we don't "vote" for, only deprioritze their transmission over ones that we as a node support. 
Perhaps instead of just an INV a version number was also sent to listening nodes. That way nodes can be selective and prioritize the blocks they ask for without being oblivious to their existence. (And falling prey to the problems the paper spoke to)

What is your definition of valid blockchain in that example? The longest?
If so then are you saying that 9000 nodes which represent 90% wouldn't need to make that tenuous choice because they would be producing the longest chain by definition?
I still don't see how that differs from 5,000,000 nodes making the same choice. The longest chain is always the valid one an in case of a close to 50/50 split it just means the longest chain will be a in contention for longer. But that's why hard forks should have at least a ratio of 75/25 before triggering to ensure that the 75% can create blocks twice as fast as the 25, which ensures fast convergence in the longest chain. 
At any rate I think percentage hash are not as important when quantifying decentralization. It's number of noses not nodes that matter. (People not nodes)

Agree with that diagram mostly.  Peter R's argument for finding the equilibrium is also mine, to let the free market decide.  History has shown us time and time again that central planning and artificial price fixing is wasteful.  A free market can find the balance, because miners will not arbitrarily choose to create too large of a block because they risk losing mining reward due to orphaning.  Miners can use the relay network anyway, so they essentially can transmit blocks to each other on a separate network from the rest of the transactions anyhow.  If the game changing factor in mining becomes a propagation delay game, then Chinese miners will be at a disadvantage, but that is just the nature of the economics and I will feel no sorrow for them.

I see that as a complimentary to the current possibility of parties "buying votes" by paying miners to filter out transactions or buying their hashpower.  If anything, it levels out the playing field.
At the end of the day, miners are doing nothing more than throwing money into a void to secure bitcoin (and guarantee consensus) if you subscribe to the notion that how they effectively do so is largely irrelevant, then does it matter whether they are burning money in the form of power or rent costs or bribery?

That presupposes that knowing where your opponent is hashing has any bearing at all to you beating them to the solution.  (it doesn't).
Hashing is like looking for a needle in a haystack, the solution 'location' is random. And everyone is searching a unique private haystack.

Right. But price in terms of what? The price of production goods. And that price is always going to fluctuate. Because the price of goods are affected by the demand for them. You can change the money base to stabilize the nominal price of your production goods but that just results in price distortions elsewhere, because you have given the market a false signal by way of creating a false increase in the demand for goods in the broad sense.

I'll agree to that. 
But the problem now is that while the economic majority may want more transactions per sec or bigger blocks, they cannot exert any economic pressure onto the miners that would make them lose money. 
With a way to filter blocks (which presumably won't be used often), the economic majority may have that necessary veto power over a bad actor miner, which gives me the belief that we could safely drop artificial block limits completely, and let free markets decide. 
At the very least it puts a somewhat unknown cost to attacking the network (non mining nodes) by causing large storage implications for everyone at the miners own expense. (Say, if a three letter agency decided to start mining but do it in order to have an effect on the stability of the network). 
Yes it will be a game akin to Wall Street HFTs.  Nodes with better connectivity would have more weight to their veto power.  But keep in mind there is an economic limit to bandwidth so it is not free, and the market forces that would drive nodes to improve their bandwidth in order to have their veto power weighted more is a positive virtuous cycle. 
In all honesty I don't know all the ways that this could be manipulated, but it seems to me that in the worse case scenario we would end up with the system we have currently, simply by allowing nodes to set a priority of block versions that they will relay.  Let's assume that block versions were secure (and that creating one with Bitcoin version A could not be forged by Bitcoin version B) then a node could say, relay A blocks with no delay while penalizing every other version with a delay. 
The penalty setting would only effect the ability of the node to relay the block by adding an intentional delay to answering a peers request for getdata. It doesn't mean that the node will not store the current block that they have heard about nor does it mean that a node can flat out deny the blocks existence.  The time to delay the block transmission can be tuned to match a fraction of the average time between the last 100 blocks or something, the intent is to delay this "unwanted" block version so that a competing version of block has a good chance to be found in the meantime. 
In the worse case where the economic majority is split 50/50 over which version it prefers then the network block time will effectively double (with each side delaying the other sides blocks) which will slow the network for a while until a clear miner majority of block version is agreed upon. (Determined by block version the nodes with the most convectively prefer)
Does this make a hard fork more clunky? Yes. But in the current scenario where hard forks are decided upon by less than 10 people in the world who run 90% of the hash power, the cost in efficiency loss of a hard fork to converge on a decision is outweighed by the fact that the economic majority can have a say at the table.  The alternative is to just hope that all major nodes start mining themselves, which is a tough solution give that will put economic demands of a payment processor above and beyond the capital needed to run a pure mining operation. (Which implies they will never be able to have as much hash power as a pure mining op)
Just a rough idea at this point. But if you think it has merit I will work on it and propose it to the dev list.

Bitcoin is agnostic to its use.  The same way it does not differentiate between "good" payments and "bad" payments on the network.  I do not think that we need to differentiate between spam or non-spam.  As long as you pay the market price for your transactions, then all transactions should be equal.  Miners are the only ones who can decide which transactions to include or not.

I agree with the fact that forks are the best way to express a free market opinion on the ruleset of the network.  The issue is that for a lone solo (non-mining) node, we don't get to vote in a hard fork --unless-- we have this mechanism of block selection which will allow each of us to 'ratify' the miner vote, in a sense.
I make the assumption that miners that contribute their hash to a pool don't care too much about their vote -- which I think is a valid assumption given that they don't care enough to run their own node anyway. 
In this system, miners vote by creating blocks supporting a particular version of Bitcoin, nodes ratify the votes by prioritizing relaying of the blocks to the ones that they vote for, and pool hashers give up both rights to vote or ratify.  
I'm not sure if sybil attacks on nodes would be a problem, given the _power_ of a node in its ability to ratify is determined by its connectivity in the network topology, (with nodes like coinbase and bitpay having bigger representation, due to the number of users which they proxy for).
I do realize that this is somewhat different from the network in which Satoshi envisioned where propagation of blocks through the P2P network is unfettered and unencumbered (and for every new suggestion there is bound to be someone who will quote Satoshi's 'original view') but to answer that criticism, Satoshi also probably didn't foresee the separation of mining from nodes in the first place, so we are already in uncharted waters in terms of incentive alignments and a tweak to level the balance of powers may be needed.

Let me get this straight, you are saying that we are more decentralized with 9000 nodes than if we had 5,000,000 nodes?
I would say that decentralization is a hard thing to quantify, I normally quantify it by the amount of money it would take to co-opt the system.  If 5,000,000 nodes were controlled by 1 company, then it is more centralized than 100 nodes controlled by 100 different companies around the globe (assuming equally sized companies).  
Different political climates just affect the amount of money needed to co-opt the nodes within.

The biggest key that most people don't understand is that miners cannot control the max blocksize, even if they could mine arbitrarily large blocks.  The major economic nodes can easily censor their blocks if they go 'too far'.  So as long as we can count on miners acting in their best interest to maximize their profit, then we can assume that the economic democracy of nodes will effectively enforce an upper limit of blocksize (as they are paying for its storage without any fee compensation)
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:55:56
I would like to see this put into the base node implementation of core, then, after which, I think I will sleep soundly knowing that if any party tries to usurp the network, be it a large group of miners, or developers, or govt, the economic masses have a say in controlling how much their influence can affect the network as a whole.
I hope that this shouldn't be a contentious change with any of the current competing schools of thought.

Interesting thank you for the link. 
I shall read this. As a professional skeptic I would state for the record that I don't take the advice of academics as objective truth without fully vetting them out first.  
I think I was inspired by a quote a heard as Scaling Bitcoin: "miners effectively control the minimum size of a block but the majority of economic nodes control the maximum size." (In absence of a software hard limit, nodes choose what acceptable size they will relay and add to their chains)
If enough of them reject a block of inappropriate size then that block likelihood of being orphaned increases. 
But of course if this happened miners may start using the relay network to tell each other of new blocks and going around the economic majority.  In that case we would need to rely on the fact that a miner wishing to sell their mining load will have problems transacting with an exchange which did not recognize their chain as the longest. 
Therefore a miner breaking from the consensus of the network would find it harder to operate, giving nodes some what of a veto power over the power of miners.

Apologies if this is off base, or covered already, but why is 20mb limit an issue if a large pool who decides to try to mine a 'maxxed' block will reduce its chances at winning the race to the next block against others who are more than happy to mine the smaller blocks just for the block reward?  Isn't the trade-off in the delay in mining a large block enough to allow market forces to find a balance of the 'optimal' block size naturally, regardless of what the maximum theoretical block size may be?

The key thought experiment is that although it costs a more or less fixed amount of money to put you on ice, there is no market for the cost of successfully defrosting you.

How will you choose which of your popsicles to try to defrost first with this new method?  The risks of failing are high, and without a secure way of judging the cost of failure, you must rely on either surviving relatives to perhaps put a premium on their dearly departed being brought back to them, or popsicles which are running low on their maintenance fees or contract terms and will need to be defrosted or dumped.

It would seem to me that your definition of decentralized is circular then. It implies that we are more decentralized if 90% of the nodes are in agreement about a 'valid' blockchain, but by definition if they all agreed on a different definition of 'valid' (a given  set of rules) then the ability of the minority to opt-out is negligible, which to me sounds more centralized.
We have to treat the concepts separately, a measure of decentralized-ness has nothing to do with the notion of valid-ness of a particular blockchain.
The notion of decentralization speaks to the propensity of a large population in a network to act 'as one' (ie consistently act together or in tandem).  The way you are describing decentralization (with the 9000 nodes vs 5m nodes example) sounds more like you mean network resiliency or node failure redundancy, which protects against random uniformly distributed failures.
Ultimately the best way to measure decentralization is in dollar value needed to co-opt 50% of the network.  (The cost to make 50% act as one).

Having experience in EVE and being well versed in the scams and Ponzi schemes therein to speak from a an expert opinion,  Bitcoin is nothing like anything EVE has seen before so cannot be compared to it.  In EVE, when you put your money with a "bank" or a multiplier scam, it pays out until the runners realize that the rate of new joiners levels off and ceases to be enough to pay for the incumbents.  They cash out, leaving everyone who had money in the system out in the cold. With bitcoin, that cannot happen as even in the unlikely event that all the "old" money in bitcoin were to cash out and sell, tanking the price of bitcoin,  bitcoin as a network would still remain, as the system is distributed and the code is open source; so as long as there remains people who want to see the system succeed along with places that continue to accept bitcoin for goods or services, then it cannot leave bitcoin holders out in the cold.

I seriously doubt that is possible. 
Assuming you do so by changing the mining algo to something which is harder to do on ASICs (there is no such thing as an ASIC proof proof of work algo)
Then all you achieve is to alienate all the current miners and exchange them for a lot of unknown individual new players with CPUs. 
In the meantime they will likely move on to mine Litecoin and litecoin then becomes the most secure chain (security as measured in cost to attack)
Meanwhile if Bitcoin doesn't immediately die or drop to altcoin status in real usage then miners will start requisitioning new designs for ASICs that can be used on the new mining algo. 
All it buys is a delay in eventual ASIC mining again. 
The best attempt at doing a ASIC resistant algo (remember ASIC proof is impossible) is with Monero, an altcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 05:34:01
Actually ASIC resistant algo is a tough one.  No algo can be ASIC-proof.  Whateven you can do with a general purpose CPU you can do with an ASIC faster.  The only issue is the cost of production, normally baked into the memory units.  So an algo which requires a lot of stored state (memory-bound) would be harder to do on ASIC cheaply.  But not impossible.
Distribution is an important factor yes.  But jumping to a new coin by selling Bitcoin is hard to do, as even with all the flaws, the ecosystem of Bitcoin is generations ahead of any new altcoin, and money is only worth something if you can spend it*

Most important features for me are
1) monetary sovereignty 
Which can only be achieved if it is
2) government control resistant
3) fungible and a good store of value
Which requires it to be a 
4) common accepted means of exchange 
Although decentralization (from a networking graph perspective) helps to achieve government resistance, having it as a common means of accepted payment for commerce is the best way to achieve monetary sovereignty.  Every government fears it's people and it is the masses rising in revolution that causes regimes to fall. Thus there is no better way to achieve immunity from the State (or any party which can usurp the network) is by making sure it is used by a vast number of common people.  We this need to grow the network as fast as possible. 
Additionally we need to make sure that we always have options in the node client implementation that we can run. Because corruption is always possible in any organization and humans can always succumb to corruption the one way to immunize the network against actors who may act in bad faith from outside or within is making sure that we have sufficient number of differing reference clients so that the whole network does not suffer from the tragedy of lack of diversity if one proves to do something that is shown to be contrary to the long term health of the network. 
For the record I think the free market is the solution in many cases, and that what may seem as a temporary reduction in decentralization in the short term could prove to help immunize the network from longer term threats in the future if we get more adoption. If 1 billion people use Bitcoin and any given tried to buy out miners we would have a group swell of new miners starting up to take their place. 
The most important principle of Bitcoin is that we value free market forces over oracles (devs) when it comes to economic parameters. 
What would make me leave Bitcoin is if it was turned into a network controlled by an oligarchy, which did not respect the democratic opinion of its users.

I don't think LN is a solution for double spend. Well I suppose technically it is but it's like slaughtering a Christmas turkey with an RPG. 
I suppose the proper solution is that the RBF txn when "accidentally" received must be replaced by a non-RBF txn otherwise the shop will not consider the bill cleared.  Which means that the shop's PP must make sure to have POS software which can recognize when a received txn is RBF or not.

That's because without RBF you can be more or less certain (given setup of the merchants processor and connectivity to other nodes) that a transaction will eventually go through.  Enough of a guarantee that merchant processors are willing to cover the double spend risk for the merchants. 
RBF is a bad idea. The more I read about it the more I don't like it. I do understand its intent, but it breaks more than it fixes and it's only needed if we are running out of block space, which is another debate :)

Yeah LN promises cool things, but there is a long road until we see it come into its potential.  Lots of hurdles, both in implementation and theory, need to be surmounted first.  (there are a number of needed new OP_CODES, new wallet software, locked channel funds, malfeasance detection and servicing, the path finding problem needs to be solved, and then issue of how to deal with the fact that the network is built up by pairwise links any of which can disappear at anytime)

The analysis has already been done on this considering GFW and up to 8mb was found to be okay without any likely effects.  (See jtoomin at Scaling HK)
And it is a common misconception that it will help China miners. That theory assumes miners in China have their nodes in China. Where as a good number of them have their validating nodes outside of China, just to avoid the GFW.  They do SPV mining with the hashing in China but the validating outside. 
Also block headers are tiny. And block headers is all you need to start mining on the next block. The GFW will not affect the ability of a miner outside of China to start mining immediate after they get the tiny block header from China (of which the GFW has a negligible O(1) effect with size of the blocks) assuming they trust that most of the time the blocks are valid. This is one of the reasons you see 1 txn blocks being mined. They didn't bother to download and process the block from China (assuming it is one of the ones actually coming from behind the GFW) before starting to mine the next block. 
This effect (with miners mining empty blocks as a way to penalize larger or slow to propagate block miners) was a subject of a study here
Suffice it to say it's a much more complicated matter than to just say "bigger blocks benefit China miners"
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:17:27
Going to cooperative miners is no guarantee of a double spend. And besides I think it's not worth the hassle for restaurant level purchases. 
As the example illustrates, the issue with RBF is that double spend is as easy as using wallet software. Quite a different endeavor from needing a colluding miner!
The problem that this creates is one that pushes the zero conference risk profile to the point where merchant processors won't want to assume the risk anymore. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:05:03
550k/block?  I guess you are taking total volume and averaging it out over all the blocks in a given time span (including empty blocks).  To do so completely ignores avg wait time for any given txn until a conf.
Also can you please elaborate on what you mean by "severly degrading the system"?  Exactly how was it degraded, and how was this measured?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:11:37
Err, except that literally they are.  Just because the limit is increased to 4mb doesn't mean your resource requirements are increased at all.  When the blocks actually do fill up with 4mb of txns, and the resource requirements become higher, then _by definition_ you have greater txn volume.

This is especially ironic, given the reasons for advocating for the "destruction of 'old' coins", is "potential theft".
That is quite hilarious, because one has to simply ask, "how does one determine 'theft' in a system that encourages coins to be anonymized?"  -- Right. You can't.  Uh-Oh.
It is precisely because they advocate for a system in which theft (or any other illegal use) cannot be differentiated from normal legal use, therefore, in order to prevent stolen coins to affect the inflation rate (because, I presume, Satoshi selling his coins is the only case where a person selling their coins would constitute a 'threat'.  I'm sure Adam Back selling Blockstreams coins would not constituted an inflationary threat)
So 'old' coins (how do you determine old?) must be destroyed, so people who wish to keep their store of value must keep the coins circulating somehow, to prove that it isn't 'lost' or 'stolen'.
At BEST, this is a horrible hack to fix a specific case which the powers that be in BTC wish to solve and can't think of any other way to solve it. (namely that Satoshi may sell all his BTC because he doesn't like the way the project has turned).  This is the bazooka to kill a fly solution, that inconveniences ever normal user of the system as a result.  But who cares, I guess, there isn't many real users of BTC to annoy anyhow, and true be told this is still a MINOR inconvenience when compared to using LN.
At WORST, this is just a foolish devolution into playing central bank, in a system that was supposed to be equal and fair to all participants, in which government entities would have no inherant advantage over public entities.  You know who controls the monetary levers to create and destroy money to match what they think is 'right' for the economy? Yes, the central bank.  So now Theymos and OG Bitcoiners are starting to say the same, without knowing it? Or do they just not think that we would notice?

How would that work exactly? If an exchange ran both versions of the forked nodes on separate hosts, would they be then responsible for separating the inventory of coins? And would a deposit of pre-fork coins be payable on both chains? Technically they would be, so is the exchange going to have to ensure that they don't? Sounds like another MtGox waiting to happen.

Lot's of people are harping on the fact that the message was not signed.  Actually, if you read the message, (regardless who wrote it) it warns us not to act on the word of charismatic leaders such as Satoshi, Gavin etc.  Thus, it would be hypocritical to sign the message, as that would bring about the exact situation that the author is trying to avoid.  Listen to the message.  Not the messenger.  If bitcoin doesn't have consensus, then it is a failed experiment. (and the value will crash to zero).

You shouldn't forget, who the "miners" are will change.

On the topic of how to deal with hard forks which are contentious, the problem I see is that hard forks are quite literally the breaks in consensus that PoW cannot solve for us and we must revert to old human ways of coming to consensus which is messy and flawed and revolves around politics.  The best we can do in such situations is to make sure that Bitcoin has a sense of identity or a core set of values that all generally share. That way identifying a fork as an attack or not becomes a bit easier as we have a central measure by which to judge qualitatively the merits of a proposal.

If you have a rule where you get fired if your average is below 4.2, for instance, and people can GIVE you exactly 4.2, then it defeats the point of the rule because people can game the system by just giving them that minimum.   The point of having a rough ranking system (integer only) while at the same time having a quota which is a decimal is so that you enforce a certain number of good experiences vs bad.  e.g., 2 'good' rankings will outweigh 1 'bad', making it a net 0.5 'bad'.  Every 'excellent' ranking counts as 2 'good' ones.  Doing it this way also gives more accurate average ranks for drivers that have more customers.  A driver that has 100 'good' feedbacks won't be penalized as much for 1 'bad' feedback, compared to a driver with 5 total 'good' feedbacks.

We need some way to counter this if indeed it looks to occur. How does an automatically increasing limit allow for dealing with this occurrence?

I think you are forgetting that after a 2mb block is found on the 75% side then they are effectively mining on their own separate chains.  The next block afterwards that the majority will be mining on wont be valid on the minor chain and the next block the minor chain will be working on will be shorter than the majority chain. 
Whatever the effects on the orphan rate it will be 3x as bad on the minority chain, and thus all "swing votes" will join the majority chain as well. 
Time is certainly a factor. While it is simplistic to assume that mining at 1/4 speed on a minority chain is the same as mining with 1/4 hashpower of the prefork chain, this neglects the fact that transaction flow is constant so those minority miners are going to start getting back logged and may encounter mempool overflow crashes. 
Yet another reason why core putting off this hardfork until now has limited our options.

Really?  Funny, because I also believe businesses will follow profit more than idealism, which is exactly why your assumption that 75% of the majority won't trigger most of the remaining 25% minority to join them is totally bunk.
Your assumption that the minority mining population will remain static IS SOLELY BASED on them wishing to adhere to idealism. (or at the very least be IGNORANT of profit/loss prevention motives)
@_date: 2016-02-12 08:58:20
One other important factor you are missing is that the minority chain network will quickly disconnect from the majority chain network, due to the "misbehaving node" disconnect code being triggered from getting too many "invalid" 2mb blocks from a peer.
Even ignoring the chaos it would cause the minority chain on the P2P networking level (potentially even partitioning it fatally), if we assume that a 25% minority of miners along with an equal 25% of the full nodes stay with core (surely not a guarantee) then the minority chain will soon find itself isolated and its blocks won't propagate to the majority chain nodes fast enough to compete with the blocks by the majority chain.  If most of the economic nodes upgrade to classic, then the chances of a 25% minority of miners holding out is even more slim.  Which makes it of course more certain that the miners will upgrade if 75% is triggered.
@_date: 2016-02-12 05:45:54
Whether you consider orphaning (block  put into the orphan pool) or just ignored (block connected to a valid parent but still not being mined on top of due to it not being the longest chain) is kind of moot no?  Either way it means that both sides are effectively ignoring each other.  The only difference is that both chains will be effectively less secure than the previous united chain, and the minority chain much more so. 
I can appreciate what you are trying to say though, that in some freak string of luck that a 25% minority chain can come from behind and actually become the longest chain.  Is that what your numbers represent?  If so then surely the numbers are only for the first block after the 2mb judas block.  As the likelihood of the minority chain coming from behind should diminish exponentially as more blocks are added to the majority chain.
@_date: 2016-02-10 03:47:32
I think your first assumption is grossly unrealistic, considering that by your own results, the orphan rate on the MINORITY chain must be worse than the majority one, and I seriously doubt that a fixed 25% would continue to mine on the old chain given close to 100% orphan risk.
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:04:12
If you want to count it that way then you should really factor in time.
Orphan rate is per block chance of losing the reward.
But if you want to compare the majority chain vs the minority one then it makes more sense to use expected(reward)/unit time.
Given that the minority chain is only making rewards at 1/4 the rate, you can interpret that as having an orphan rate of 75% (in pre-fork terms)  This should be enough to indicate that your first assumption is not a realistic one.
Not that this isn't good information, but we need to keep in mind that it only shows the dynamics in a trivial degenerate case.

"No hardfork wishlist items are included" -- considering you have been the primary proponent of 'hard forks are dangerous because they can be contentious', I would assume it would be easy to understand that the more bells and whistles you put into the HF the more likely it will be contentious, just like how Bills in congress work.

1 - block stream doesn't have any projects you can boycott yet.
2 - block stream's proposed projects will HELP bitcoin scale.  Much more than even a NO LIMIT block size would.  If you don't believe or understand this, I suggest you attend the Bitcoin scaling conference in Montreal coming up.
3 - If you still don't believe this look at Ethereum, they are a project which is trying to solve all the current issues in blockchain design all at once.  Note that they have something which is equivalent to lightning network. 
4 - If you still don't understand or believe this, then I must assume you dislike Blockstream because they are a company.  You may note that it is a company formed by core devs in order to secure funding for the Bitcoin project  as a whole.  This is not a conflict of interest, as any business model they may have will require bitcoin to be successful.  This is akin to say, Ripple Labs taking on funding from VCs, or Goldman putting money into Coinbase.  Would you boycott Coinbase for taking money?
5 - If you accept that if we want a core group of developers working on bitcoin at all, then we must accept that they must get paid.  Blockstream is at least a clear transparent way for them to do this.  If you don't like any changes that they propose then you aren't required to support it. (run it).

You can help out by running a BU node. You will signal to the miners what maximum size you will accept and what block depth you will go along with the consensus. 
If everyone was running BU then there would be no danger in hard forks at all because the forks would resolve themselves without issue (2mb would likely pass and converge but a 60mb block will be forked off the network)

 Not at all. Or at least not from anyone that I have personally spoken to. Perhaps if you keep your ear stuck on Reddit channels you may be fooled into thinking this. 
The closest thing to this I would say was that many old time  veterans of the Bitcoin talk wars warned me going into ScalingBitcoin HK that Core would never agree to a hardfork even IF there was a consensus. (You will recall that at the time the rhetoric was that coming to consensus on how to hard fork was stalling because nobody knew which solution to pursue). I will say I did NOT believe the detractors and gave core the benefit of the doubt. 
Well, as you can imagine my surprise that after all the miners replied with a resounding Consensus of 2mb (oh you won't hear anyone admit this anymore, but if you were There in person, you would know) that core still did not opt for a hard fork and instead opted for this quirky little complex (but kinda cool) thing called segwit as a soft fork (kinda not cool, uglifies the codebase more) which basically proved all the core doubters who snubbed the conference right. 
So while I don't think it is "ego" or "spite" I think core earned itself "skeptical doubt" of pure motives after that. At the very least they are guilty of not listening to the market when it resoundingly answered the question they were using as a reason to hold on hard forks. And instead opted for a solution that gave them more technical job satisfaction. (Allowed them to show off their skills)

that's only if you accept the premise that sidechains and LN is Bitcoin development.
So far, the only developments I see that are strictly on Bitcoin itself, are changes that will make LN and Sidechains work. (enabling off-chain solutions).  I'm not against that, but I wouldn't bucket that into Bitcoin developments that strictly make the base network better.
For comparison TomZ's flexible transaction features or xThin and expedited forwarding work is what I would consider exclusive Bitcoin improvements.

apolitical currency?  Sorry that is not possible.  Nor was it ever the intent for Bitcoin.  I think many make the mistake of conflating apolitical currency with currency without a central bank managing it.  Money as a political construct, can never be apolitical.
but semantics aside, I agree that it is a shame that a follow on presentation to jtoomins talk on the GFC's effect on block propagation was not presented.  One was however, submitted, but the scaling committee for whatever reason did not approve it.

Yes they were brought up many times in the Bitcoin dev lists by multiple parties. This is why I'm convinced the core dev model is broken. They only started to listen and sounding concerned after we stood to prevent segwit from reaching activation limit.

Maybe, but still your advice not to spend or move your coins becomes invalid advice. Unless you are subtly suggesting that people don't spend their coins in the new altcoin just because. 
What you probably meant to say is it is safer not to spend your coins from hardware wallets or exchanges until you confirm with them which of the fork they are supporting (maybe both) and if it's not the side you want then you can ask them to return the coins to you. 
With hardware wallets they won't be able to support both but you can safely split your coins by sending them to an exchange (or any service that supports both coins) to separate them for you. You can then put the coins on the chain the hardware wallet supports back to your device. 
Paper wallets are unaffected.

I don't think block size limit was ever intended to be a consensus rule. Not any more than the technical network limit of 32mb.  All these were meant to be overcome by developer work moving forward.  The alternative belief is that Satoshi meant for the client to stay exactly as it is without alteration for 150 years. Which seems to me pretty hard to believe. 
If we really believed that then why even bother adding P2SH ? Isn't that adding more consensus rules?

Nor I yours.  You seem to shuffle between trying to convince big blockers to concede to 95-98% activation (quite impossible IMHO) and now to reductio ad absurdum pleas to a rule can be arbitratry as long as we all agree to it, then the network stays united. 
While true, you can't make people agree to your set of arbitrary rules.  and since it seems obvious that we cannot convince each other to honor each of our own selected ruleset (we've had 10 months or 3 years trying to do this, unsuccessfully -- with the last 8 months of debate being pushed beyond absurdity levels) its quite obvious the only way forward is to part ways.  I wish you well on your fork.  May the market decide which is more useful.

This topic is going into the semantic weeds.
I would just end by saying if you believe that all decisions are technical and not political, then you are naive.  Many political decisions are masked with a technical facade.   All that is required is for a political agent to approach a techie and ask "What are the reasons you can think of that will make this a bad idea?" and then support that answer from the techie.  Techie's by nature of not being political most of the time (as most are more true to the pure pursuit of truth and science) will always be able to see both sides of a topic (and thus have ready arguments for either side).  So won't be too diametrically opposed to one side being preferred all things being equal, as long as their pockets are lined.

Great list of reasons Tadj. I wholeheartedly agree as those  were my thoughts as well after HK.

I see.  So the data on Factom is stored collectively by ALL the Factom servers? (without which, the notion of decentralized storage won't be true)
So factoids is to pay for the collective permanent storage of all the data on Factom which is entered (hashed and indexed) by 1 server, which is paid for by entry credits?
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:38:05
Not saying I disagree with your valuation, but you are forgetting the software. Satoshi client is a mess of spaghetti code that could use some significant cleanup.  It's one of the biggest obstacles that prevent more development on it due to the unfortunate interconnected nature of the code. If 21 managed to separate and clean up the base node alone (network serialization code most significantly could use a lot of refactoring) then that is worth something.

Are you saying that entry credits bought from one server can be used on another?  If so then they will fulfill the role of "factom usage money" even better and you even have less of a need for factoids. 
It seems to me and correct me if I'm wrong is that your main arguments for needing factoids is to incentivize the running of factom servers on a purely speculators basis. Speculatory because I cannot identify the economic utility that a factoid represents besides potential gains from speculators.  Entry credits seems to sufficiently support the fees to be paid to the servers for actually doing their job as servers where factoids serve only to encourage speculation and allow for pump and dump strategies to have an exit. For instance with factoids you can say that the value represents the value of the utility of the factom platform, but actually it is entry credits and their value (wrt BTC or USD) that actually represents this.  Factoids are created (or minted) by factom servers which are not necessarily actually entering anything onto the chain, but just participating and ostensibly increasing decentralization, at the cost of speculatory server ops which may run many servers for a time just to collect factoids and to dump them for BTC at the earliest opportunity. (And this would not happen if factom servers are only paid when they actually sell entry credits to be used )
 
The thing I don't understand is, how is this more efficient or better that say Tierion which can hash and store arbitrary proofs of data onto Bitcoin blockchain directly and produce a receipt which you can use to forever prove its existence.  Is the entire value of a decentralized "directory index storage" service which this network of factom servers providing, paid for by a speculator price driven inflationary internal currency factoids just as easily served as a simple auditable "Tierion hash receipt"?

What if we kept block real estate available by ensuring we kept blocks big "enough", and prioritized txns by fee (replace by fee) considering also the time it has spent waiting and only if the previous block was full (and it was not included)
My concerns for replace by fee is the opportunity for double spend cause my immediately paying yourself back with a higher fee.

if the protocol is useful, would the protocol still be useful without Factoids?  If the factoids are just 'licenses' to use the protocol then they are worthless if the project is open sourced.  If the project isn't open sourced then you have to trust Factom, so its not decentralized.

Because pegs cannot be lent out.  For instance, the simplest of pegs is just a sending funds to a multisig address where each of the signatories is a cartel member (lets call them 'banks').  Then the only way coins can be taken out of the sidechain is when a majority of the signatories sign a payment out of the multisig peg account.  It cannot be fractionally lent out by any one bank, nor can any of the pegged funds be removed without a appropriate amount of the sidechain coins being destroyed.
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:45:46
I'm more inclined to think it is, because it has no internal coin, and requires bitcoin to be pegged in.  Any sidechain who requires Bitcoin value to be pegged in implicitly is supporting Bitcoin as the reserve currency, and will bring wider adoption to Bitcoin as the money, (not necessarily Bitcoin as the network), which is the most important.
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:06:00
I don't understand why you wouldn't just sell entry credits directly.  Entry credits represent a specific service from a specific server. "The right to store Z blocks of data with X server."  That the value of that service will depend on any given servers load and capacity to serve such requests.  I see no need to 'delegate' this right to others.  (essentially selling futures on services that you may not be able to service when the time comes)
Why not just charge for the service directly, especially as we have Bitcoin in which digital payments can be done in real time ( compared to wet networks).
Selling future services is a great way to expose yourself to supply issues if the demand on any given server is overloaded at any time.  Which means, if you think about it, selling Factoids is like fractional reserve banking but instead of money you are fractionally lending out your service.  
I don't see any reason for this.

Very true, but you know what was missing in 1995? The strict regulations that are really forcing banks to tighten their belts now.  You don't worry so much about improving the efficiency of your back office when your front office is continually reeling in millions.  What you do is you hire more salespeople, and give traders bigger bonuses and more freedom to 'be creative' in making more money.
It says a lot about how governments work as well.  Unless there is a reason to cut expenses, the will never do so.  It's basic economic behaviour.  So we either must align their incentives appropriately (free market approach), or create more and more regulations and rules to control their behaviour.

I think that a few permissioned blockchains may end up being used in sort of a cartel like fashion.  But it certainly will fall short of the 1000x savings in costs that some of the more elaborate claims are making them out to be.  Why it doesn't matter in the long run though, is because although it may save them some operating costs in the short run, then fact is as Bitcoin grows more and more widely adopted as a global alternative to fiat, more and more people will realize that they don't really need many of the current bank services anymore. (ATMs, remittances, payments, market liquidity) and they will likely be reduced to nothing more than insurance companies.

You know what? Surprisingly very few. I can say that I worked with folks a lot smarter than me, who are very logical and analytical. But when you are in the inside the job keeps you occupied and so busy you don't have time to think more about the big picture.  Big picture thinking isn't necessarily encouraged. That's for the bosses to worry about. Just make sure you deliver on your tasks and you will be paid well. 
The thing is in Wall Street, you are paid to be financial engineers, not philosophers or economists. A financial engineer much like computer scientists are very focused on details of solving problems and rarely on the "why" something is being done. (Most of the time it's because it makes money for the firm)
Reading Zero hedge is mostly discouraged and discredited by management.  So any non-biased news takes a dedicated interested person to actually try to stay abreast of.  We all knew that we were to blame for the financial crisis, but we always blamed it on "the other banks" which mismanaged their risk. I have to say that at GS I did know some smart MDs who would quote Keynes to me, but at the time I had no time to really delve into it. 
So I would say that there are probably more economic theory savvy Bitcoiners than there are at Wall Street banks (percentage wise) by far.

Servers need to monetize their efforts to pay their bills. The token expands the options for doing so in a distributed system that allows for the flow of servers into and out of service.
Why not just charge for the service directly, especially as we have Bitcoin in which digital payments can be done in real time ( compared to wet networks).


I'm not sure I follow.  I agree that servers need to be compensated for running their services.  So instead of having servers create factoids by operating which then need to be sold? Why not just charge for running a server and entry credits in bitcoins?  Is it because you want to peg the value of factoids to USD somehow?

Bravo. Excellent piece. 
It is very clear that mainstream economists (Keynesians) are going the way of the dinosaur. They cannot see their own extinction. 
We are living in Keynes' "long run" where he and everyone who follows him are dead or dying and for their lifetimes his theories proved to work.  The one correct observation that Keynes had was that his theories would not work in the "long run" but in the long run "we will all be dead". What people didn't realize was that he was not talking about "us", but himself and his believers when he coined the "we" in that quote. 
Keynes' brilliance was that he stole from US, those alive now making US his creditors to his generation. And now it's time to pay it up or pay it forward onto our children. Which will it be?

I did exactly that just recently on Quora, there seems to be an endless stream of people asking about deflationary currency and that it can't work.

The point is, there is an economic value for factoids. And the Factoids paid to the servers should balance the value placed into the protocol.
It seems you just explained the only value to Factoids is to buy Entry Credits, which, 3 responses ago, I put forth the supposition that if you made the system simpler and just let people buy Entry Credits with BTC, then you wouldn't need Factoids at all.  So it seems you agree with that supposition then?  If the Factom protocol is valuable then people would just buy entry credits (with bitcoin) to use it.  Why isn't this good enough?


Well Teirion may be a centralized service, but the proof is decentralized because it is on blockchain.  Also, because it is on bitcoin blockchain, it seems to me pretty censorship resistant.

Maybe.  But how would we be able to tell the difference between an attack or a just prolonged stress test with the intend on pulling off some major high profile double spends?  I'm all for bigger blocks so long as we can be sure that we don't push our miners and nodes to centralize more.  Keeping node diversity is key to keeping decentralized control which in turn is key to prevent the govt from just 'buying out' Bitcoin.

That is sort of what they are doing with permissioned distributed ledgers.   I don't think it's a pure coincidence that all the banks are jumping on board this initiative.  That's because banks don't want a monetary revolution. They just want to cut costs for themselves. (Which is in their right to do). I would expect if it comes to pass that there are no other plausible use cases for Bitcoin, then the gov would try to regulate it out of existence quoting reasons such as "protecting the public good" or counter terrorism.

The beauty of Hearn's arguement is that it plays exactly I to the governments hand. The only way the government can effectively stop Bitcoin is by putting its security and mining power into large NSA compliant corporations that must abide by government laws.  Decentralization is Bitcoins only defense against this. Contrary to what many think there is no way the government of USA can ban Bitcoin, the political backlash would cause a riot that would make Occupy Wall Street look small.  There are enough of the economic cogs of Silicon Valley invested into Bitcoin for any such political solution.

True, but the fact that you don't know for sure which miners will or won't is what keeps everyone in check, and double spends under control.  The instant you make something 'standard' then double spends are no longer a stochastic endeavour but a deterministic one. (and game-able)

If you can buy entry credits to use the protocol, and that is all that is required, then what would be the possible incentive to have any factoids at all, and subsequently, what would the value of the token be, and would that be sufficient to incentivize servers to run the Factom?
@_date: 2015-10-17 00:22:41
Yes, I doubt they will use mining.
As a pegged sidechain without need to bootstrap value into a new money, they don't need proof of work to ensure consensus.  They are also systems that will inherently require more trust to use, but as a result will have cheaper costs ( in energy consumption )

I doubt that any autonomous agent that only has the blockchain but not the realtime mempool is going to be practical. (You are essentially saying that listening to live transactions are worthless)

And I would agree.
The world has not seen any tool which expands the domain of personal freedom since the internet.  It may take a couple of years before people learn enough about it to embrace it, but embrace it we will.

Certainly more likely it's just a hell of a lot easier to code as discontinuous changes to the reward instead of a continuous curve.  Think of all the decimal issues you would incur in validating that a block paid the correct coinbase, think of how mining businesses would have to calculate their returns.  Think of the complications with chain reorgs. There is very little benefits for a lot of complication.  Therefore I'd say it's very much KISS principle at work more than any game theory thing. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:58:25
Well I must say I'm not certain it will save costs but I think that there is a big potential for costs savings. I may be wrong as I'm not factoring in the potential new costs of securing an permissioned blockchain from hackers consensus breaks etc. 
For example, prima facia, a shared permission ledger that would replace the correspondent banking model of remittances (of fiat) would release a lot of tied up capital that banks need to front to maintain their credit lines with each other. 
Another is if (assuming) they got the system to the point where you can trust consensus instead of your own operations department to reconcile all the daily trade settlements in a batch process (necessary in a double entry accounting system such as we have now) then you can cut the headcount of your ops department by half.

Yeah, god forbid people cooperate in Bitcoin! Because the network works best when people are actively fighting to kill / discredit / ostracize each other right?  That's what ensures decentralization right?

And when you fork away with Lukecoin, you guarantee big blocks on Bitcoin.  It's a matter of perspective.  But you know that already (and selectively like to paint it from your point of view only)

Success is relative.  It guarantee's its *survival* would be the more correct term to use.  It guarantee's a mutual split of the network.

This is why I have been saying that LN channels is nothing more than a bank account.  
You are trading default risk of your bank (or bail-in risk) for risk that LN channel close cascade due a sudden inability of Bitcoin mainnet to process transactions, causing a vicious cycle of more channel close attempts, resulting in channel closes not getting processed in time, causing LN channel fund thefts to be more viable, causing more people trying to close.
You trade real life bank-runs caused by economic panic for technical network wide bank-runs caused by technical bugs/attacks.
Given the choice, I would like to keep the base bitcoin layer with as high a transnational processing capability as possible. And I would take/accept Bitcoins over LN channel bank account coins.  At least with Bitcoins there isn't a threat of theft (due to channel closes being infeasible, thus penalty recompense txns unable to be claimed) if I just sit and hold my coins during such a cascade failure.
