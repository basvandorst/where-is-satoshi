Nothing that Soros says or does can be good. At all.

Hmm... maybe the poster forgot to add a year? Perhaps in July 2010? From what I can find, the price of BTC back then was only about a nickel, so one could've bought 20 BTC (a dollar's worth at the time) and, assuming he held to this day, would be around $200,000 (hence the tens of thousands mentioned).
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:53:40
Or even mined BTC with a CPU or taken any from a Bitcoin faucet back then; the original one gave FIVE whole bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:45:59
Agree; I can relate to the original poster's message...

This is one of the most mature comments I've read, so thank you very much for posting. Yes, let's call out the haters and trolls for what they truly are; such individuals are toxic for any community and should be kicked out. How many of them would actually have the heart to donate any of their precious BTC for a worthy cause? I bet most of them never would, because they're too arrogant and busy bragging about how much their BTC is increasing in value.

If she's a very clever and computer literate grandmother, then she could've just stolen the private key and wouldn't need to spend anything on transaction fees! Sneaky, huh? ;)

This is the main reason I preferred the old BTC; because it wasn't mainstream. Most of those who entered the cryptocurrency scene back then did so because they were interested in the technology and ideals behind BTC. Of course, there were a few who did so because they realized it would boom like the Internet and make them wealthy. However, I can't help but feel that since BTC became mainstream, many newcomers are flocking to BTC only to get rich quick. This disappoints me, because they don't get the big picture and would prefer trading in their freedom for profit in Monopoly money. In that sense, I think cryptocurrencies would've been better off if they hadn't become mainstream and remained "cult currencies".

I know what you mean, your brother sounds a little like me. I first started collecting BTC last year when the price was around $600 using faucets. However, even though the price has increased by almost 20 times, I still can't help but feel like I missed out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity by not entering the Bitcoin scene back in 2011 or 2012. I first bought some BTC earlier this month, but even right now, I still keep thinking: Heck, even if BTC rises to a value of $100,000, it's only a tenfold profit; I'll never manage to live a luxurious life with such returns. I don't know what hurts more: having thousands of BTC only to lose it all, like what happened to your brother, or never having that much. It's unbelievable how much money, or rather lust for money itself can destroy you from within. Luckily, I have positive thoughts most of the time; after all, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are untapped sources of wealth yet to be discovered. And not only that, but they have the power to change the world by banking the unbanked. That image of hope and prosperity for all, not just me, is what is on my mind.
Anyway, I feel like I've gone a little off-topic. Forgive me, I tend to do that when I'm emotional. My condolences to you and your family, and I agree especially with the last paragraph of yours. There's always a glimmer of hope while you're alive, and living in despair can only do you harm in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:37:16
I know how you feel. After about a year of getting to know cryptocurrencies, I finally decided to purchase some BTC recently. I regret putting it off until now, since I could've afforded to buy even a whole bitcoin or two, but now I can only afford a hundredth of a bitcoin... sigh...
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:59:58
Either they don't understand the concept of difficulty adjustment or they're trying to push an anti-cryptocurrency narrative. My money's on the latter, considering the likes of mainstream media like Bloomberg.

Have you checked out Mario Dian's article on Freedom Node? I personally used it to set up my Lightning node on Linux, so I hope it might be of use if you're interested in running one on the mainnet.

Sorry to hear; at least you have a choice. It would be better if mobile game developers either switched to another Bitcoin payment processor that respects users' privacy, or even better, allowed them to withdraw to their own BTC wallets.

I haven't experienced this issue yesterday (unverified account, by the way), so I have to ask: Who exactly is affected by this? Only U.S. residents?
P.S. I notice people saying things like "Don't use Coinbase" or "No one is forcing you to use Coinbase". Here's the thing: I'm a regular Bitcoin Aliens user, and they allow withdrawals only through Coinbase. Does anyone have similar grievances?
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:16:34
I use lnd as well. Tried the autopilot once, but I experienced the same issue as you (channel closing after a while), so I just resorted to opening channels manually. Yields much better results, and I can set the funding fee. Experimenting with channels can become an expensive task with the default funding fees of 5-10 sat/B, so I stick to 1 sat/B.

Whose money did you invest? Yours or your wife's? If the former, then you should have a say over your own finances. If you're the one bringing home the bacon and being responsible with your funds, then she shouldn't be as adamant as you claim she is. By "responsible", I mean not sacrificing basic needs and getting mortgages to invest.

Attractive visualization of the Lightning Network. Is your node shown on it? I'd imagine mine would look like a mere speck less than a millimeter in diameter, somewhere in the  outskirts.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:53:45
I have only one open channel at the moment. I created another one today, but it's still pending. I had up to three open channels at one point, but two of them were closed sooner or later by the other party.

Same; he's a pleasing individual to listen to and very open-minded when it comes to cryptocurrencies, preferring them to the U.S. dollar, which is printed en masse by the Federal Reserve and whose worldwide adoption is enforced by military action and increasing debt. Bitcoin doesn't have any of those characteristics and is thus superior.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:59:29
What a brilliant idea! Why not distribute the 12 words in 12 different places and make a treasure map to guide them around? If they want the BTC, then they got to work for it! I might seriously consider doing something like this.
Of course, you can also try the modern approach and use augmented reality like Pokémon Go where you got to catch them all to get the treasure! Hmm, granted, spoofing is a major concern. I'd rather stick to the former method; it's more fun anyway!
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:26:28
Could work. Why not just pay for a frame like "Buy Bitcoin" to be flashed between advertisements? When they pass by a Bitcoin ATM, they'll be tempted to buy some. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:13:23


This. If you use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your BTC, then all your kin actually have is a promise from Coinbase that they'll pass your account balance to them. What stops them from revoking their right to that by, say, asking for more personal information or even freezing a deceased one's account for reasons such as "money laundering" or whatnot?
I think it's better to stay safe and keep your BTC in a wallet whose private keys you own and have an executor pass on your private keys to your kin when you leave this world. Less paperwork and less hassle. I'm not a lawyer, so feel free to correct me if I made a mistake.

Congratulations on your buy! Isn't it nice when you can afford to purchase a home or automobile with BTC without having to go to a bank and ask for a loan? I'd love to hear more success stories like this one.

Then you put the GPS coordinates of the four different Trezors in yet four more Trezors in four different locations. Then you take the GPS coordinates of those four Trezors and put them in four more Trezors in four different locations. Repeat as necessary. With such security, not even your beloved Jason Bourne will manage to get ahold of your BTC, but Chuck Norris can and will, if he wants. But let's face it, if Chuck is onto you, you're done for anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:11:06
You're welcome! Don't worry, if masterminds like Jason Bourne and Chuck Norris aren't conspiring to steal your BTC, then the security you currently have in place is good enough. Certainly better than that of most users, including yours truly.

I'd recommend this approach as well. I've been into Gridcoin for a couple of months now, and I appreciate its unconventional proof-of-research algorithm, which incentivizes contributions to BOINC projects in the form of gridcoins.
It probably won't make you rich enough to buy a certain luxury automobile, but I don't think it matters anyway. Freedom and altruism are more important goals to achieve, in my opinion.

Two questions:

The people I know don't care much about freedom, privacy, or decentralization, which symbolizes everything Bitcoin represents. They're too attached to the traditional banking system and mainstream media to be redeemed. I hear some of my peers in real life talk about Bitcoin and their worthless USD or EUR profits from it. Those who sacrifice their financial freedom for Monopoly money profits don't deserve it at all.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:02:24
Everything you've said is spot on. However, I'd say that I don't care about being rich in terms of fiat. Everyone who owns BTC is richer than those who own fiat, because they have something that's priceless: freedom.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:10:37
Both statements are wrong and based on common misconceptions about Bitcoin and money in general.


Intrinsic value is independent of any government backing, and is rather based on the value of any commodities backing a specific currency. What is USD and EUR backed by? Faith in the government? If they took their money supplies, how could they tie them to a specific commodity such as precious metals? They couldn't, because they don't have enough such commodities to back every single dollar or euro in circulation.


If by "alias" you mean Satoshi Nakamoto, no, he doesn't back Bitcoin in any form. As far as the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is concerned, this is a somewhat controversial topic. Some would argue that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value because its only value is derived as a medium of exchange. However, it could be said that its intrinsic value is based on hashpower contributed by miners to secure the entire network. Additionally, the blockchain technology used by Bitcoin allows users to store data (e.g. images, documents) in an immutable manner, which could also count as intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:32:58


Imgur is centralized and as such can be taken down easily because it has a single point of failure. Also, if you look at my previous post, you'll notice I stressed "immutability". This means that any images that get included in the blockchain are there to stay and cannot be removed by anyone. Most ordinary users probably don't require a public immutable ledger to store their images, but specific types of users such as activists could use the blockchain to store anything, say, of political significance. In that way, they could ensure that it won't be modified or removed by any malicious party in the future. Heck, you can even use the blockchain as proof of life, like Julian Assange did a year ago. So what might be useless to you might be useful to someone else.


Sure, you can use an altcoin to do the very same thing; that's the power of open-source software. Most will probably still prefer to use Bitcoin because of its network effect, though.


I don't doubt that. That's why you have cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Monero, which are designed for specific use cases (smart contracts and anonymity respectively).

First off, I'd like to congratulate you on the translation. I do notice some occasional spelling errors at first glance (e.g. "inovatina"; see homepage), but it's nothing damning. I do have a few suggestions, though:
* You made a mistake when specifying the required open port to allow incoming connections. It's 8333, not 8833. Link: 
* If you're going to translate everything, including technical terms, to Serbian, then why not be consistent and write the term "block chain" as "blokčejn" or, even better, "lanac blokova"? Same applies to Bitcoin Core (Bitkoin Kor). Serbian grammar is not my strong suit, but don't you Serbs always use phonetic spelling when writing foreign words?
I'm sure there are a few more suggestions I could add, but I haven't reviewed the site in detail. I don't have too much time at the moment to do so, but I hope the suggestions I made were helpful.
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:24:21
Ha ha, that's basically what I tell newcomers (who, ironically, are mostly into computer science) in real life who talk to me about "blockchain technology" and how it's so revolutionary, so special. People think you can just take a specialized data structure and use it to replace something more general. It just doesn't work that way.

Indeed. That's why I seek free Bitcoin stickers using two-part epoxy as adhesive to plug leaks on my yacht. Makes me look rich as well.
