People don't seem to realise, past roughly 2,000,000, bitcoin has a higher market cap than the GDP of the world. Past 3,000,000, bitcoin has a higher market cap than all money in the world. Unless the world decides to adopt bitcoin and the majority isn't being traded, I doubt we will see more than a few 100k. I think end of 2018 bitcoin will be roughly 80k and continue to slow down in growth logorithmicly

Well technically it's already activated. It's just not being mined yet

Could be scam, could be people buying for illegal transactions as they don't want to put their identity on an exchange and have coins used in drug trades traced back to them. My bet would be a mixture of both.

That's what I have been afraid of. Been trying to buy asap. Local price went from $4200 to 5160 in a week. Limited supply, huge demand. Finally got a certified account so buying add much add I can

There will almost always be people trading anyway. It's only the big holders that won't trade much. The rest would trade where they need to cash out or want to buy in.
When it comes to mining though, no doubt if the cost to reward is prohibitive, miners will reduce their hashrate reducing the difficulty until it's at a sustainable level where supply of fees to demand for hashing power is balanced.

While in New Zealand
I bought yesterday at $5200, It's not increasing as fast but short supply over here
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:02:25
My local price is $400 USD more than international due to banks being dicks. I decided to buy in anyway and wine up to the local price being $4400 USD with a shortage of coins. Do I wish I bought even a day soon? Yes but I couldn't but I bought as soon as I can and sure I could have gotten a better price but down the road it's not going to matter  if you bought at 3200 or 3600.

There is no such thing as a true quantum computer yet. Current systems simulate quantum computing but are not true quantum computers and generally are used for nothing more than research development. 
That's ignoring the fact that quantum computers are not general computing systems. They do not have the capabilities to mine and most likely never will assuming we actually can make a true quantum computer.
Lastly even if quantum computers can mine, there is no reason for it to cause a reduction in value. Higher computational power does not mean more bitcoin.

Most of these people have no clue what they are talking about. AES-256 will take billions of years to break. It will do fine. 
Source: I study encryption and understand how AES,  DES, RC4, ECC and other encryption methods work. If someone can crack AES-256, there are much bigger targets than your bitcoin wallet.

Lucky. I bought right as the dip was about to start. To be honest only lost $25 on the purchase.  Still up $900 on total investment. $600 gone from the dip but it will rise again

Even if that did happen, we would just fork off from a previous block and continue on

Repair wallet then move funds to a supported wallet. Multibit HD is dead.  You should find the settings in the programme to repair

Safest if you know what you're doing. Half the time people set up Linux to be less secure. 
Best situation is if you have an old laptop or something, reload in your chosen os, cross fingers you don't have a rootkit, unlikely. Block every port not needed for your wallet. Install wallet from source, check hash. Don't trust MD5 hash out Sha1. Request the sha256 hash from the developer if not available. 
Backup the wallet file, maybe leave a copy with your parents or a bank security box. Have your wallet on another USB device at least and keep it separate from your system. Electrum used aes, no doubt with sha256, would have to check. That means that as long as your pass key is not leaked and it's not simple, they won't be cracking your wallet even if they have the file. You could up load it to the cloud and as long add they don't get the key, you're safe. Though break your coins up between multiple wallets with different unique keys. If one is compromised, it's better to lose 25% of your coin than 100%

These systems seem really badly designed. Considering how much money is at stake, these systems should have a mobile data backup and only hold onto money while confirming the transaction made it to the mempool. If for whatever reason it can't get a connection, it should give some relevant information such as a ticket that can be used to either confirm or refund users where the machine failed to maintain a connection. This is hardly a new issue and plenty of solutions have been used to fix it. This is a social issue more than technical but these systems need a backup system and a fallback for the piece of mind of the user and company. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:33:07
Don't kill yourself over this, take this as a learning experience about security. You won't get those coins back and that's really crap but seriously take this as a lesson. 
When it comes to money, whether it's fiat, crypto or value in other objects, don't trust anyone. Money makes people mean and that will break the law for it. 
Get a password manager, keepass is a great offline option. I would recommend against using cloud base solutions for bitcoin and bank accounts but for everything else, it is more than safe. I would recommend Lastpass for a cloud based solution. 
Keep your wallet local, don't use an exchange or online wallet. I did for a while and the only reason I didn't lose 0.1 BTC was thanks to 2 factor authentication. Side note, use 2 factor authentication where you can. 
To stop the possibility of losing your wallet from say a fire, backup your wallet file or words given to you using AES256 encryption. Make sure you keep the pass key safe, secure and offline. Backup the encrypted file to USB, hide it somewhere where you will remember. In case of fire, backup the same encrypted file to a Dropbox or other cloud solution like Mega.nz. Try to keep that account secure but remember even if someone gets the file, they won't crack it if you used a strong, 16 byte randomly generated key unless they find that key. Lastly if you need one last backup, USB in a bank security box. If it's worth that much, The bank is ironically the safest place to store a wallet. 
Lastly, don't use a wallet with large sums of bitcoin on a computer you actively use. Grab a raspberry pi if you have nothing else. A pi 3 can even run a full node. Don't let someone else onto your computer with a wallet and don't install remote software on your system. 
This may seem like a lot to understand and do but just a little caution and setting some time aside to change all passwords will save you and others from going through this kind of thing. 
One last note, get an email provider that respects your privacy and encrypts your email. I recommend Protonmail but lavabit is also a popular choice.

Agreed. Should see a nice little rally to 4950-5050 then a pull back to maybe 4600. I wouldn't worry about a pull back unless it drops bellow 4400
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:06:39
Well you also have to port forward but anyone can do that in 5 minutes. 
But yea, anyone with decent bandwidth, the storage available and a system to dedicate some resources can run a bitcoin node. Took me 2 days to download the blockchain, 20 minutes to find the information I needed to make a full node and 5 minutes to port forward. Hell bitcoin core cost use tcp hole punching to make all bitcoin core clients nodes if they really wanted to. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:07:45
Well the security of wallets in coinbase doesn't matter too much for the end user. Most private keys are shared between users since coinbase only needs to record coins in to specific public keys for each user and then maintain a record of that. Of course if the wallets were compromised that would be a significant issue but the security of those wallets are more likely offline encrypted wallets using some chosen encryption parser algorithm specifically hidden from the public to protect from even attempting to brute force the system. You're more likely to have better luck trying to modify the database that stores users value rather than the coins itself. 
This is obviously  hypothetical and I don't recommend anyone attempt to hack wallets or exchange systems. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:14:25

It's about time. The fact that buying bitcoin in this nation leads to a risk of having your bank account closed and blacklisted from opening another account as if you were done for fraud along with the government expecting you to pay unrealised gains tax on a volatile market. It's about time we got a big gun coming to the nation to help improve the system locally. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:24:54
It's also a massive sell wall. It may do a lot in generating faith in the crypto market but the majority of volume is from traders who see a pull back at roughly 5k. Just depends where the bulls run out of steam. Traders expect a pull back at 5k so more traders will sell in hopes of rejoining at a stronger support level

People who say this have no clue what they're talking about. If you have a wallet encrypted with say aes-256 had a computational complexity of 2^256. There are attacks that are a little more efficient but it's a drop in the bucket. 2^256 may not sound like a lot but in reality that's 1.158*10^77 different keys. That's a lot of combinations you have to brute force. Then test. And that's assuming you know the exact implementation of the algorithm. Maybe they are using triple des as well? Not the most secure encryption on its own but adds to the complexity. 
I would put a wallet with a bitcoin, encrypted with aes with a secure random key, up on this website and be 100% confident no one will crack it

A DDOS attack on the bitcoin distributed network is technically feasible. Though it would have to take down not just the bitcoin network but the infrastructure itself. E.g. the internet. 
In reality if such an attack were to take place, at best it would take down a regions internet leading to a disruption to the distributed network for that region, maybe forcing a fork if only the international line is disrupted (islands like NZ would be an example) 
But essentially the only way to permanently disrupt the network is to disrupt people's access to the free and open internet as a whole.

This attack from the r/btc crowd is pretty obvious. 
Pump bch, state some bs on bitcoin.com. start filling pro btc forums with FUD. Don't buy into it. If you're scared of losing that money then you shouldn't have invested.
Bitcoin is still higher than what it was 2 weeks ago. This is a correction. Ride it out or short. But don't lose your shit
