Rather than buying a lot of crypto/stocks/whatever in one go, you buy smaller amounts over a period of time. For example instead of investing $1000 all at once, you invest $100 weekly for 10 weeks.
It works for me because I don't have a large sum of capital to put in upfront so instead I put in smaller amounts every week, amounts that I wouldn't miss if everything went south.

Or not blowing your wad.

Well there you go, TIL my strategy has a name.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:58
I ended up just selling a little bit so if this is the bubble bursting or a price correction I have some cash to buy in at a lower price. If it doesn't go lower after a few months I'll put that money in a Vanguard account instead. Still hodling with the rest though and doing my weekly buys.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:54:54
Except I don't have a nice lump sum to play with, so I put in smaller amounts on a regular basis and build it up over time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:25
I get hit with the crazy transaction fee's when moving it off the exchange so I only do that every few months. But I don't get a large fee when buying.

An ETF would be fantastic. Aren't they supposed to be coming soonish?

I think it's a bubble, but I also thought this bubble would have popped well before now. I don't think this will be the last bubble and I think BTC will go higher than it currently is in the long run even if the bubble pops. I'm going to keep buying for hodling. If it drops I'll sit on it until it goes higher again and sell a bit more. Rinse and repeat. If it all goes to hell it was a fun ride and I didn't lose anything I wouldn't have wasted at the bar anyway. To me it's more a gamble than an investment. Don't gamble what you can't lose and have fun in the mean time.

My strategy has always been to buy small amounts weekly, basically throwing 'beer money' at it. If it goes to 0 sure I lost money but it won't affect my day to day finances. Has worked out pretty well so far and I don't lose any sleep if it takes a big dive. I'm also holding for the long term but I'm pretty tempted to sell a few now. I really believe this is a bubble and it's going to pop some time soon (although I was sure it'd have popped by now). Tempted to sell some and open up a vanguard account now that I finally have enough for the minimum deposit.

haha my bad
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:48:37
This is exactly what I do. Buy it weekly, then transfer it off the exchange every month or two.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:49:50
I lost a bit in the MtGox fiasco so I only keep small amounts on exchange now. Once I get enough that the transaction fee out isn't an issue I move it to cold storage.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:55:12
I'll always make sure to keep some BTC. I only have a relatively small volume so as great as $150k is, it's not going to be buying me a house any time soon.

And my newely seperated hooligan coins are also gaining nicely.

The 1% fee to buy BTC I can deal with. It's the 0.0005BTC fee to transfer BTC to my non-exchange wallet that's the killer. I usually only buy about $20 worth of BTC at a time so at the moment it's costing me around $5 of that just on fees to get money in and BTC out which seems pretty egregious.

Isn't electricity cost a huge problem? Sure you could rent my computing power when I'm not using it but the cost of electricity would most likely be more then you'd make in BTC.
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:53:54
Do you also invest outside of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:04:37
Isn't that a pretty big risk if the price takes a sizable dive in a short period of time?
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:03:09
The idea is to buy about $20 worth a week so it's basically beer money. I already lost 2BTC during the MtGox clusterfuck however I still made a net profit overall from the coins I initially purchased a few years back so I wasn't too disappointed. Also learnt my lesson about keeping coins on exchanges for longer then I need &amp; have stopped playing the market daily.

I remember hearing they were finite but never really looked into it, I was more interested in playing the market for shits and giggles. I also remember hearing about the possibility that they were going to change it to not be finite.
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:20:49
Like a pump &amp; dump?

I think Bitcoins got great potential and I love the idea of it (which is why I want to invent) however I see still see it as a pretty big risk (hence only inventing beer money). Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:16:24
I'd be investing small amounts on a regular basis (basically beer money). I know it as a huge risk however I also think it has great potential which is why I'm only planning to spend an amount that if I lose it, it won't affect my day to day life. Kind of a poor mans investment moonshot.
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:45:36
I was thinking more long term. Buy a small amount each week, something like $20 worth. The idea being in 10-20 years they might be worth a pretty penny.

Did allowing bitcoins increase your sales? Do most bitcoins sales from from a particular geographic region?
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:16:12
I'm confused? I just checked and it's about $120 per BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:20:23
What do you sell?
