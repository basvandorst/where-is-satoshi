The thing is, for a lot of people in the world who live outside of the West, that *is* a dream. House, education, transportation, a medical infrastructure. I am always taken aback by how "happiness" sits higher than "survival" for most people, and I think that's because the population of the West knows no different. "But I'm not *fulfilled!*" I hope you find happiness, or something that will take you away from these systems you hate. I may be the off person out, but my idea of happiness is not endless hobbies, either.

I am reasserting my stance, boy, because there seems to be, inexplicably, some confusion about what I was saying. 


It is arguable. It is totally arguable. See, shit like *that* is what I am arguing about. Your weird absolutes. That's what lead to the bitterness of the original post, which was (if you're even paying attention anymore) the only thing I was going against.

I get it, it must be liberating to know you have the exclusive understanding for what everybody in the world defines as personal fulfillment and happiness. I'm over it, you win, I can't argue with Dr. Manhattan.

If other people are offended, it is not the content so much as it is the tone and expression of what you are saying.  That's really I'm going after here. That was what I was going after in my first post, and I'm sure it came off as passion, but I just heard it as dark absolutes.
"You're getting paid by your masters" and "I'm just trying to get people to think." You're not splitting the atom on any of this, and if you truly believe that the housing crisis was just because of suburbia, I would invite you to go looking into the details. Not *everyone* was to blame, because if *everyone* was, it wouldn't be a tragedy. And by the way, maybe a yacht is happiness. Maybe having a yacht is amazing. Do you have a yacht? I don't, but maybe it's incredible. It's like a pirate ship and you can catch sharks with it. 
That's all I am saying here (not the sharks, but everything else.) I don't like suburbia, I won't want to live in a suburban house. I don't like that mindset, but thankfully I don't see us getting more invested in that, so it's not even really a growing problem. I don't think the government is perfect, but I think most of what you were trying to say was bogged down in your commitment to poetry. *That* is where I do the Tyler Durden thing. It was this revolutionary pep talk with very little substance. Like... The government is to blame (ineffective,) but you're also blaming the people (shitty and lazy,) you're blaming everyone, but you're also not... 
I'm not debating the facts here, because they are impossible to debate because they have been covered so frequently in the media, from all angles, for a long time. And I get that you're a libertarian, and society has a place for libertarians. But you seem like a decent person, which is why I didn't see cause to come out right away cussin and spittin, and why I'm *pretty much* done with my stance on this whole exchange, because it really was just an off-the-cuff reaction to the expression

Happiness has nothing to do with being a libertarian, I was simply stating that he seemed to attack peoples' definition of happiness while, at the same time, espousing libertarian views. Furthermore, he basically states his idea of happiness is not relying on everyone, and how this feeds his definition of freedom.
I don't care where we came from, because we came from shitty places. We came from places of civil wars and disease and *actual* slavery. The question becomes: what is your definition of freedom? A lot of people say privacy. Then you look at Facebook, which does shitty things with your data. They are a private company. Oddly enough, it would be the government, if anyone, who would pass a law to prohibit that. Much like the government did with actual slavery, which could be best expressed as a thing you could do if you had total freedom and fewer laws. Like land barons. Like tribalism. Like turn of the century factories with shitty wages and no health regulations. So the question becomes: would you give up some money and individual freedom to make sure that a governing body forces others to not make a slave out of you? Both are different sides of the same coin, and like I started earlier, the only stance I am taking is against dealing in absolutes.

You're right, you have exclusive understanding over the human mind and what the human race experiences. Keep on keeping on.

This sounds to be the crux of your whole worldview, which is a very right-leaning thing: personal responsibility and all that. 


Okay, listen Tyler Durden, I don't know where you're getting this image of people from, but I *bet* it's from the very same TV shows and entertainment you condemn them for being drunk on. You do realize that these people who buy houses are also scientists, lawyers, police and firefighters, teachers and engineers, and everybody else, right? They make money and pay taxes so they don't need to fashion their own clothes or pave their own roads, because that is how society graduates. There are only so many hours in a day and their maximum potential - often times the **thing that makes them happy** - is best realized when they can put their time towards the thing they are good at. 
If you want to take your ball and go home, and move your home to the woods and live as a survivalist, that's all well and good. Nobody is going to stop you. You wanna know why? Because I can do something you can't. I can stand here and *not* tell you that my version of happiness is better than yours. I won't go to an accountant working in a cubicle and try to convince them that *fishing* would make them happier than what they decided on. If you wanna cash out of society, nobody is going to stop you or tell you different, but for the love of fuck get off your high horse and stop telling everyone else that their ideas of survival and happiness are wrong. You will quickly find that the concept of the rugged individual is, once more, a myth of the West, and that if things *actually* go to shit, we survive in communities, in societies, and with each other. With systems. 
You have a problem with that?
@_date: 2013-03-05 00:54:34
Yeah, that was the main thing I was trying to get across. Survival is more or less taken for granted, especially if you live in a country with a *lot* of social programs (I live in Canada.) There are a lot of initiatives in place where if I fell into hard times, I wouldn't die. So our great conflict in this society is really happiness, fulfillment, following your dreams, etc. My girlfriend is Filipino and her family is very conservative because they came from the shitty Philippines, so this "I just want to leave my well paying job to go paint!" is completely alien to them. I always try to keep that in my mind - that and all the other recent immigrants I have met - and weigh my opinion of firstworld society against their testimonies. Otherwise I feel totally spoiled.

Oh, so you *do* see how happiness factored into his thing, thanks for asking a question you knew the answer to?


I know. That was what I was saying in my post. I was saying that his sweeping generalizations of passive people bewitched by the media and enslaved by something they hate.


No, I am saying that if this is how you define slavery, you should acquaint yourself with the actual slavery that often occurs with tribalism. Again, you seem to be agreeing with everything that I am saying while disagreeing with it for... Some reason? My stance, once more, was that I am not dealing in absolutes. Goddamn, I even said that in my *last post.*
