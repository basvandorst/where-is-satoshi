A.  You can only crack a wallet if you know the public key to crack.  This is why HD wallets (like Electrum (my favorite), or Multibit (bleh)) use addresses once only.
B.  The community can just change the algorithm used for encryption to something quantum safe.

This is linear.

The odds of a collision occurring are astronomical.

"Clean your computer" ?  In what way?  Do they specifically wipe the hard drive or are you talking adware scanning? Big difference.
    A. Do you have the seed words?

ah, go ahead then. That's pretty much safe.

Electrum, just write down your SEED WORDS in a SAFE PLACE.

If you're reloading the entire blockchain on your computer, stop.
I've helped people recover bitcoin in the past.  I have (small) trading histories in  on freenode, and some people know me.
Feel free to find and look them up if you need.

What are you trying to say?
Online wallets are NOT safe.
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:09:42
Yes, there are sure things.
You don't need internet at all to use a wallet.

You're talking about recovering data, seed words. 
Are you talking about downloading a blockchain for bitcoin-node or syncing multibit?
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:02:07
First, stop using the computer.  You may overwrite things.
Second, be more clear about what you're trying to do.
    A.  Do you have the seed words or not?
    B.  What are you trying to put into wallet.dat format?
@_date: 2016-06-08 05:17:58
yeah, what's up
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:59:37
Because it's OUR fucking address and maybe we want to leave bitcoin HD?
