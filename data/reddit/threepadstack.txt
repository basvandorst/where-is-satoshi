thats interesting, thanks for your response. it does beg a couple of questions though. seeing as these are futures, technically doesn't the actual purchasing of the bitcoins in question occur on the 17th, and up until then they're just betting on the predicted price at that date? wouldn't that mean that there will be a bunch of buys on the 17th once the contracts expire?

can you please elaborate what that means? if i understand correctly, a margin call occurs when someone borrows money to make a purchase, if the value of that purchase decreases, the borrower can make a margin call to make sure that the person borrowing maintains their maintenance margin, so i dont exactly understand how that applies in this situation

You can buy brand new on ebay. 
EBay is a great place to find rare stuff. If you're rich enough, you can buy it on the spot, and again, you can buy from a few high end dealerships online. 
And I disagree with the idea that you have to buy new otherwise you're faking it. One of my dream cars is a classic 1960s Aston martin db5, which costs over a half million dollars, you can't always get those from the manufacturer, but on rare occasion, you can find something on eBay that Lamborghini can't make or get anymore. If I showed up to an Aston martin drivers club with a used db5, I wouldn't be an outcast, my car would be the main attraction

Bitcoin has more than one trend. What I think you're talking about is the trend of the price of bitcoin. There are thousands of trends, including but not limited to volume, volatility, the long-term trend of percentage correction that you also mentioned
Your math is sloppy. the 2014 run saw a peak of $1175 on dec 4 2013, and it bottomed at $162 on august 18 2015 on bitfinex. thats a correction of 86.2%. on december 17 2017, btc peaked at $19891. that equivalent drop would bring it down to $2742.42.
youre right in saying that past performance doesnt dictate the future. and i already said that i think bitcoin will go back up. but i still think it has significant room to go down, and i think it will go lower than most people think. it always has.
you can argue that 2014 happened because of gox, but they suspended trading on feb 7 2014, which was after the top of the peak. the bear had already begun, its just that gox potentially extended it (both time-wise and price-wise), but to the exact extent, we cannot define. 
what i dont understand why people think they have a magic ball to say that they know price wont go below a certain level. what happens if a 1 million btc whale decides to cash out? flooding that much btc onto the market would crush the price. you cant predict what is going to happen. you say that people calling for $100k btc were crazy. in jan 2017, if you had said that it would hit $10k at the end of the year, everyone would have told you you're crazy. greed is a nasty thing, but it exists, and if you can manipulate it, it can be a very powerful tool, ones that people choose to use, because quite frankly, we've been trained to think that way. thats what capitalism is.
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:44:16
lol, you're contradicting yourself. average low? wtf are you talking about. the fact that you're so non-chalant about the numbers, you lose all credibility instantly.
what i'm willing to sell my bitcoin for has no bearing on what the market dictates the price is at. 
and the funny part is you think i'm claiming thats whats going to happen, when all i'm saying is that its a theoretical probability. not once have i said i think it's going down there, i've only used it as a reference point, because the math suggests that based off the previous trends, its a realistic possibility that you have to account for.


this means that you think you know exactly how all of this plays out. by all means, tell us whats going to happen then.
oh, and thanks for referencing my post history without actually stating what i said. you're just throwing darts at this point. i have my strategy, you have yours, and you seem to get offended that someone could suggest that it could be anything different. quite frankly, i dont really give a shit what you think. the funny part is we're all going to win in the end, but you feel the need to lower yourself to the petty level of arrogance because you think your strategy is the only correct way to win in this game

You've said a lot of stupid stuff, but the price volatility alone makes this a huge gamble from the start. Yes, it's a rigged game, but to suggest gambling it all on crypto is a dumb idea. Bitcoin could drop to $2500 in the next couple of months, what happens then? The $75,000 down payment on your house you've been saving for the last decade just got crushed because you had it in bitcoin. 
You're betting your life savings on a currency that hasn't seen mainstream adoption, and if you're able to, by all means, go for it. But as the wu tang clan said, you need to diversify your bonds, nigga. You might not know when you need cash for an emergency, keeping it in fiat, at the moment, is a lot less risky than btc. Or if you want to invest in the stock market, you need a platform to access your trading. Or if you want to take a loan to buy a car, or a house, you need a financial institution to help you pay for it. Will this be possible in a crypto world? Eventually, yes. 
But your black and white statement of enabling bullies does not take into account the complexities of life, nor does it account for the wild volatility of crypto

a drop from $6500 to $2500 is still a 60% drop from where we are now. for a market to increase in value, one of the things you need is volume, of which has been declining significantly in crypto. do i think it'll go back up? absolutely. are there market cycles? definitely. is there still room to drop? the answer is yes. 12 months ago, the price was ~$2200. a full year bull market takes time to correct, and while we have corrected significantly, there is still room to go. and you didnt list the 9 year trend you're talking about breaking, so that could mean anything

@_date: 2018-07-27 07:38:03
Well, the fact is that a majority of marketplaces have some level of manipulation. Instead of denying it, by accepting it and offering some sort of parallel that can be related to, or offering some method of controlling the situation, you have a much better chance. The facts don't change, but the attitudes surrounding what the facts mean can be presented in very different ways
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:52:43
government interference is not the only form of manipulation. if you've been part of the bitcoin/crypto space for a while, you can see that the whales can manipulate the fuck out of currencies. 
you can definitely make more money by being worse. volatility is a big part of the equation. if a worse currency has a significant amount of volatility, it can be manipulated to make vast sums of money. 
also, if you look at bitcoin right now, it has long(ish) transaction waiting times, and expensive fees. litecoin is 4x faster in terms of block speed, and the fees are practically irrelevant when comparing the two. yet bitcoin has 20x the market cap and 50x the value. 
and finally, in the "long term" is also relative, because many institutional investors don't invest long term. high frequency trading is all about making a quick turn-around in trades, it doesn't matter what you invest in, you're looking at the trends of everything, and seeing which ones you can take advantage of within a split second. they make hundreds of thousands of trades a month

there are things you said that i agree with, and theres a lot i disagree with. i'm not going to respond to everything, all i will say is that its not as black and white as you are suggesting. i'm not saying that there is no logic to your argument, i'm saying that your logic is not the case 100% of the time as you are suggesting. there is no currency that is a best situation for everyone, people all have different needs/wants out of their currencies, so when you say "Ultimately what we should expect in the cryptocurrency space is for everyone to be on the same currency, because it's a winner takes all situation, in an economic sense," i disagree. you can even see it with bitcoin itself, the community is divided on a lot of issues, almost none of which are government related. there is no "one-fits-all" currency, at least not yet.
and for what its worth, there are dozens of examples of where a better technology does not last.
