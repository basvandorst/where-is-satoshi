BIP-70 provides bumpers for noobs to prevent under and over payment, leading to tons of support issues, requiring lots of human staff. It also provides security enhancement by using existing SSL to make it very obvious that you are sending your money to the right party, not a MITM.
I think a better question would be, why would anyone be against it?

If your wallet does not support BIP-70 in 2018, you should be mad at the wallet producer. This is a very very old spec that has been part of the Bitcoin reference implementation for years.

Just like all of the other wallets! Your logic is circular and nonsensical.

Well, in this case, BitPay is trying to leverage its place in the market to push wallets to implement the (now 5 year old) spec.
If they made it optional, then everyone would opt to use the old way, and it would undercut their effort.
It is obviously a very controversial thing to do. However, I hope it pushes wallets to improve the experience for their users by implementing the spec, vs people pushing all of these hacky workarounds. Eventually someone will get scammed by one of these MITM services that claim to be helpful.
Just like wallets should implement the (only 1 year old) segwit change to improve experience, they should also strive to implement other useful specs like this one (actually many 70, 71, 72, 73)

Then start by boycotting Bitcoin Core!

whats the answer?

Seems like a wise move to align the brands. "BitPay" kind of implies a wallet anyway... Looks nice!

cool! now, monetize this somehow ;)
