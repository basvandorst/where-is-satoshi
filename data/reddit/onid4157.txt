If you have 2k ready to go into bitcoin do it as soon as you can. Trying to time the market and wait for a dip could leave you frustrated and it may not happen. Anything under 30k is a steal imo

Much more room for growth and gains in Bitcoin. The stock market has been on a bull run for years and a pullback is likely within a year or so. *not financial advice just opinnion*
If you do your research into stocks there are some that you will see gains as long as you hold long enough but like the crypto market, there are cycles. 
Personally I like Bitcoin because it is changing the way we invest and store our money. We are our own banks. It's a global currency. Inflation cannot affect it and so on. Bitcoin is bae.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:17:26
Buy now and also buy at 9k (if it goes that low). If you plan to buy and hold for at least 5 years, it wont matter if you got in at 10k or even 5k. We are getting in at an amazing time.

Exactly. This is just a healthy market cycle we're experiencing here and the fundamentals have only gotten stronger regardless of what prices show.
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:52:06
Nobody knows for certain but I feel the price won't change very much around halving time.. I wouldn't be making investment decisions based on this point in time.
It'll be a good indicator that the markets have purged and there's likely a sloww incline in price, but refrain from expecting a moon shot. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:41:33
As awesome as that would be, it most likely won't happen. Do you really think the U.S gov will allow that to happen? They will do everything in their power to not be taken over.

The uncertainty of what platform to use and how to extract your money when needed. With the collapse of Quadriga and such, it is nerve racking to trust any sort of exchanges.

You're jumping in at a great time. We may see a bit more decline in price but we've definitely seen the bulk of it over the past year so IF there's more to fall, it's not far.
It's probably been overwhelming to take in all the info from this post but this is what has worked for myself:
1. Move coins from exchanges to your own wallet as soon as you can. I initially started off with 'Exodus' wallet for desktop. It's got a simple to use interface and supports many assets. 
2. Record your seed (wallet backup) and store it in a safe of some sort. This seed is very important for recovery of funds incase something happens to the device you store your coins on. Memory of the seed and a Cryptosteel is a great safety precaution. 
3. Try your best to avoid day trading if you aren't familiar with how it all works. Hodling is your best friend until the next all time high.
I wish you the best on your journey! It's a fun one.

There is no better way to transfer funds from one person to another. Money can be sent from one side of the planet to another within seconds and with minimal fees. Try doing this with the traditional banking system or even gold for that matter. There is also a finite supply and can be used as a global currency.
For the first time in a long time, our own wealth is in our hands. Bitcoin and things like it, are the future.
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:04:08
Buying at any point right now is a great investment. Maybe you didnt time the bottom like you had hoped but your future self will thank you even if you buy at 20k. Just keep buying slowly if you have extra money
@_date: 2019-02-15 05:34:36

There are cryptos that already have better technology (faster, cheaper, more decentralized ect..). But at the end of the day, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and will likely be strictly a store of value and something we can make large purchases with so the lack of updated tech doesn't really matter imo.
Long Live BTC.

Localbitcoins.com is a good option for selling
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:09:34
Localbitcoins.com is my personal favorite. You can buy from trusted individuals with a variety of payment methods (etransfer, meet in person with cash, ect). You pay more for bitcoin this way but I enjoy the peer to peer transaction more than using an exchange.

I wouldn't recommend burying the hardware wallet cuz of the fact that its electronic and will get destroyed from moisture. Engrave your seed onto non corrosive steel and bury that in your backyard.
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:01:52
I'm not sure what you mean by wait for your package or any of that. But when you purchase bitcoin from the seller, once they received payment they send the bitcoin to your wallet on localbitcoins.com. Once you have them in your wallet on the website, you can instantly send them to a personal wallet of your choice.
@_date: 2019-04-25 03:10:15
I wouldn't be so confident in that. This pump has me feeling good as well but imo we are going to test previous lows before confirming the bear market is over.

There is no better way to exchange and hold funds than bitcoin. We can send bitcoin from one side of the planet to the other almost instant and almost free and with no middleman (banks).
It's also incredible for people who don't have access to bank accounts. As long as they have a device and speed, they can hold all of their wealth themselves. This is a game changer.

Exactly. People trying to get tax deductions because of losses that happened in 2018. I'd rather just take the decline in prices and hold rather than let the gov know what I've been up to. Use non-kyc exchanges!! You pay a premium but so worth it imo.

There are no ‘fools’ who invested. Whoever invested in Bitcoin has some knowledge and intuition on where we are headed in the world. Some people are more fortunate than others as far as entry point goes but in a decade it won’t matter if you invested at 6k or 15k.

They are of the same value as USD. Instead of pulling money out of the crypto market, you can exchange for stable coins and use those funds to re-enter whenever you want. Say Bitcoin were to go to 80k, you exchange your btc for a stable coin, and then bitcoin pulled back to 25k then you have 80k worth of money to buy bitcoin at 25k. I hope this makes sense

Some would say bitcoins technology is behind the times when it comes to the other tech that is in the crypto space now. Bitcoin is what started it all so it's king at the moment but if there were a clone of it I'm not so sure it would be used a whole lot. Just my 2 cents
