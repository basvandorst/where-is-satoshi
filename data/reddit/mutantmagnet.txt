They profiled Dorian and Satoshi.
Both Dorian and Satoshi have the same writing style such as double spacing after periods. 
Both switch between American and British English.
Both have the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The only difference is a legal name change to Dorian.
     
That sums up their direct links.
     
     
Their indirect links come up from interviews with people who worked with Satoshi creating Bitcoin and investigating Dorian's life since birth.
     
     
Dorian has the mandatory skillset required to create Bitcoin.
Satoshi uses outdated coding styles that is typical of oldtimers from Silicon Valley.
Dorian stopped being regularly employed after Sept 11 which overlaps with the time frame Satoshi needed to build what he did before he started getting help.
Dorian's health turned for the worse after having a stroke around the same time Satoshi stopped talking to his assistants.
     
     
There's more but these are really the important parts for their profile.
Also, when confronted after calling the police (who ended up being too curious to know if the reporter was on the right track) Dorian did say they are one and the same.

You're over thinking it. Knowing who invented Bitcoin is an interesting side show but what has been grabbing mindshare are the arguments over whether or not it is a credible currency and how people lose and make money off of it.
