The old saying goes millionaires don't beleive in astrology, billionaires do. I think it was John Rockefeller that used astrology as a guide to investing.

And maybe we just end the discussion here, passive agressive political arguments truly drain me lol. Best wishes.

No they remove content that goes against their agenda, not just content they deem harmful. When you have tech giants using their platform to push the agendas of the largest donor, you indeed have a problem.

I have seen evidence of this censorship right here on Reddit, through trending topics being pushed on Twitter, people's followers being deleted if Jack doesn't agree with content. 
So it's a private platform, don't use it you say. I don't believe many people realize that these platforms have political alignments and are attempting to have an effect on their thoughts and beliefs. Which they are doing because they have sold out to push agendas that are beneficial to donors. So they do it through a disguise of being neutral. And what would be the opposite of Twitter? These platforms I don't believe ever had these intentions but once people realized their power they fought to be the controlling entity behind them, there isn't really another option to go to.
Why can't their be a private platform that doesn't censor based on personal belief systems? Doesn't make sense to me, then all you created was an ego-centric echo chamber.

What are my talking points, that the left leaning tech giants censor content to benefit their agenda, then yes? You assume I'm against something just because I make an observation, it's not that black and white. And yes MSM is garbage, I don't consume it. I'm talking about control of information flow on social media sites. And ask Venezuela how socialism has worked out for them. I don't doubt parts are beneficial, but again everyone is moving further on each spectrum. Again, I don't care to get into a political debate or care to know how you lean. Censorship just doesn't seem to mesh with bitcoin, and if you think it does your missing the point.

I don't want to get political with this because it's all a show really, but most tech giants along with media are very aligned with one side. Once you look a little deeper it's extremely obvious. 
There should be no government involvement, free speech and no censorship, unless something breaks the law.

Exactly, it's painfully obvious that these platforms push the leftist agenda and attempt to control public opinion, and it's corny to me. Jack gives the go ahead to allow algorithms to filter this material, I don't believe he is sitting at a desk personally deleting tweets. 
And no, the options are not make my own or concede I'm wrong. I'm just stating that I have witnessed the censorship that takes place on Twitter. Believe me I don't care what anyone else believes and waste no time pushing my beliefs on anyone, unless people ask me for advice, which many do. And I interact in real time, not through tweeting. I'm not asking for advice or for you to tell me anything, I am just agreeing that Jack censors things he doesn't agree with. He goes against everything the Bitcoin community stands for, so I agree it's dumb to praise him for this. That's all. Have a nice day my friend.

The intrinsic value of bitcoin is that it is an accounting system, and a currency wrapped into one entity, thus eliminating the third party. The value is in the accounting aspect.

Value of conservative beliefs? I like how you make the jump to automatically assume you understand my beliefs. I will tell you I don't conform to any set of outlined beliefs, other than good vs. evil (which is subjective). I don't identify with any group and like to critically think for myself. You don't need to label yourself, by doing so you automatically create restrictions. That said, from an outsider looking in perspective, it seems the left is trying very hard to control the flow of information as of late, why would that be? Twitter didn't become what it is because everyone agrees with Jack's political views, he had a good idea for that type of platform and executed. Just understand, division is the goal, and always think for yourself because both sides spoon feed bs. And really the left right now just feels like a socialist group (hence the censorship of information), coming from someone who doesn't give a sh*t about what side anyone labels themselves as.
