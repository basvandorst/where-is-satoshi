Would've been hilarious if the chips got stuck after processing the BTC

I bet the fees are going to be fucking ridiculous. Look at this currency converter scam in a tourist trap in Prague:

Uhhh I wouldn't quote Warren Buffet in a Bitcoin forum lol. He's an outspoken advocate against Bitcoin and it goes against all of his investment criteria. He only makes investments in companies that sell products and services and generate positive cash flows. 
Google what he said about Bitcoin lol he literally said it's worthless

"Old money" isn't just sitting in a checking account. It's invested in things like savings accounts, stocks &amp; index funds, home equity, art, businesses, etc. Things that gain value over time through interest/generating returns or approximately retain their value relative to the rate of inflation, like a home. 
It doesn't result in lower debt for people in debt because interest rates are almost always higher than the rate of inflation. And in addition to this, purchasing power decreases with inflation.
Inflation isn't "bad" as long as wages and GDP grow at a similar, relatively low rate. It's a natural result of a healthy economy. Hyperinflation is horrendous though. If you don't think inflation can be bad you should look at the economies of Argentina, post WW1 Germany, Zimbabwe, etc.
