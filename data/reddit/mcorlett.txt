How would you "work around" the U.S. government controlling more than 51% of the network, for instance?
As I see it, they would completely block transactions, making people panic and sell whatever they can, which would further drive down mining profitability, which would make more miners quit, which would make the government's share of the total mining power even greater. Rinse and repeat.

No. They would only be mining on top of their own (empty) blocks. Because they are faster than the rest of the network, everyone accepts their chain because it is the longest.
You can mine blocks with transactions in them all you want, but if they control 51%, they won't mine on top of them.
@_date: 2012-04-18 13:03:43
When your client receives a new block from its peers, it checks if there are any transactions relevant to your addresses inside. If there are, the transactions are stored in your wallet and added to the client's transaction list (this is used to calculate your "balance").
When you don't go through this "block-by-block" process of getting the blockchain, and instead just throw in a complete up-to-date copy, the client assumes that it has already gone through the aforementioned process, which is fine for a new wallet (because the addresses are newly generated and won't have any prior transactions), but old wallets (with prior transactions) require a rescan to find any old transactions.
It doesn't damage the wallet in any way. There is no way to specifically tell the client which blocks to scan; it's an an all-or-nothing approach.

There is no 51% miner right now. If there were, it would be up to them whether they would like to be friendly and mine alongside everyone else, or only mine on top of their own blocks.  
I'm not sure what it is you're suggesting.
@_date: 2012-04-05 17:33:40
That's right. Bitcoin script-hash addresses are assigned version 5, which means they begin with '3'.
@_date: 2012-03-27 19:11:34
Yes. This doesn't mean the funds are safe just because they have the private key, because you also have it and can start an attack just as easily as without them having it. So they'd still have to move funds from the address corresponding to the key, and wait for an appropriate amount of confirmations.
I still don't fully understand why you want "pull transactions", but I've been trying to answer your questions from a purely technological perspective to show just how flexible Bitcoin is.
Also, you don't have to give them both the address *and* the private key, because calculating the address out of the private key is trivially simple. It probably doesn't matter for most uses, but I still thought I should mention it.

Sorry, no. If you modified your client to accept 10, 12, or 14 decimals, you would be shunned by the rest of the network.

Actually, when you create a new address, it doesn't generate it on the spot. Instead, it takes one from the key pool; so a backup will even work for up to (by default) 100 addresses in the future.

My understanding of godofpumpkin's original post was flawed; I apologize.
The "no" was not in reference to "if all they do with their 51% is not include transactions, I don't see what the problem is", but rather to "51% is just as scary as it always has been [...] for reasons completely unrelated to the empty blocks".  
The ability for an attacker to completely halt transaction processing is one of the largest problems in this scenario. This is not irrelevant or unrelated. 
Imagine if every single store accepting VISA cards stopped processing the transactions all of a sudden. That's 2000 failed transactions per second.


Because this entire thread is based on the theoretical scenario in which the miner was attacking or threatening the network. It was not a suggestion. It was an analysis.

Giving you my credit card details (as one would when purchasing something), gives you the ability to charge that card for any amount available to it (within practical limits).  
This is possible because of the safety net credit card companies provide; if you get screwed, just request a chargeback.
On the very core layer of Bitcoin, I can give you the private key to an address, and you will be free to take as much or as little from the balance of the corresponding address. The problem is that Bitcoin doesn't provide an inherent way to initiate chargebacks.
Note that this is just the very core layer. Similarly to how the credit card companies built their services and chargeback functionality on top of their currency of choice, there is a very real possibility of having a Bitcoin "credit card company" of sorts.  
Mt.Gox already does this to some extent: you can send funds between Mt.Gox accounts without the transactions hitting the Bitcoin network at any point.  
Only when the customer wants to move the funds out of Mt.Gox will they have to create and broadcast a transaction for the world to see and for miners to permanently place into a beautiful block.

The only thing proof-of-stake accomplishes is to make the attack a tiny bit more expensive. That's it.
Also, proof-of-stake creates centralization and requires trust. You must trust the people who have large numbers of bitcoin, to be both active, and not malicious with their investment.
This goes completely against the principles on which Bitcoin is based.

Aside from what was mentioned, subsidizing mining in the beginning is a way to make sure there is a reward for mining, or as I like to call it, securing the network.
Slowly (roughly every 4 years), the network is going to halve the subsidy - we'll go from 50 to 25 as early as this year, until eventually the network will (hopefully) run entirely on transaction fees.
This is by many regarded as the biggest "technical" issue with Bitcoin, because there is no sure-fire way to guarantee that there will be enough transactions taking place to support the network and protect it from attacks.  
Unlike the automatic difficulty adjustments which depend on the total speed of the network, this has been hard-coded into the software.

Thank you.  
I haven't talked to reddit personally, but [it's been suggested before]( and the request was sadly ignored by the administrators.
The front-end is written in PHP, with the back-end (including the OTC rating bot) written in Python. I have MySQL and memcached doing the heavy lifting in the background. Payment notifications are handled by [bitcoinmonitor.net](   
I estimate a total of about 20-30 hours of work, but that includes a lot of playing around with reddit's undocumented API for sending gold, and writing the IRC bot.
I intend on releasing most of the code behind the service into the open source community when I get some time to clean it up and check for more serious attack vectors, because if anything, this was a learning experience.

I'm glad you think the developers will be quick on their feet to fix a similar issue, should it happen in the future, but it's ultimately up to at least half of the network to start hashing on the new chain.

I don't have much time for a full reply, but I'd like to just respond to one part:


This really isn't possible. Bitcoin shuts out every other vulnerability, or problem, associated with cryptocurrencies at the cost of keeping one - the "double spend".
Still, you say "using the network as the trusted entity", and we're already doing that to some extent. We're trusting that 51% of the hashing power is friendly and will not start an attack against Bitcoin. Because staying on the right side of the law is incentivized, I'm not particularly worried that this will happen. Executing a double spending attack may be fruitful in the short term, but mining right alongside everyone else and collecting block subsidies and transaction fees while you're at it for a longer period of time *is* more profitable.

2) How can you reverse the damage caused by a malicious transaction creating hundreds of billions of bitcoins and completely destroying the trust people have in Bitcoin as a store of value or medium of exchange?

This is misleading, it's not universally 6 characters.
The Firstbits algorithm begins at the first character — if another address buried deeper in the blockchain begins with the N characters (converted to lowercase), it increments the character count by one until it is enough to make it stand on its own.
The correction of this is of the utmost importance, as we don't want users to take this for granted and assume that the first 6 characters will always be enough to differentiate the address.
