Is it possible to use the ideas of other alts on Bitcoin once they are tested and worked? I have read only about how they use Litecoin to test all the features they want to improve on Bitcoin. What about something like DASH, XRP or XMR? Will Bitcoin ever beat them on low transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:51:29
How much do you think we need to raise the fee to to get our transaction confirmed faster? I am using a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:49:45
It is currently at 164k+ right now. Base on what you said if every transaction has the same amount of fee eventually if unconfirmed transaction amount reaches 360k it means a Bitcoin transaction would take at least a day to be cleared? Otherwise how much are we going to have to raise in fee to have our Bitcoin being transferred faster? 
I don't know if some miners are spamming the mempool to raise the fees to benefit themselves or not but this is a potential threat for the system. No wonder why most alt coins have been pumped a lot the last 2 weeks because it was easier getting transactions done with them. 
Do you think we need to slow down with the adoption from the public and focus more on improving the tech?

I agreed BTC does have great value. But Idk if it deserve the value it has today. I really hope BBC isnt a significant contribution to its price pump
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:14:52
For the sake of not just my finance but the majority of the people in this sub I strongly hope my idea mainly came out due to the load of cocaine I just took.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:14:40
My theory is people behind BBC pumped the BTC price so they can sell with higher price than the technology is worth. They have a lot of them in reserved, I believe when they started the system BTC was around 600$/1BTC. They could be using Tether to do so and all the dumping we see with large amount can actually be BBC owners dumping their BTC to pay for their system.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:11:58
You don't think BBC is scary as well? What if the people behind BBC are the ones who pumped the price of BTC that much so they can sell their reserved BTC to pay for their system? Are we seeing lots of dumping from the BBC owners?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:38:44
It is ok as a bubble if the demand from the community is real. But if my theory is right then the bubble was caused by BBC people then they can dump it when lending demand is low (so the BTC they collect worth less) then pump so the BTC raised value and they can sell to pay the interests for their customers. Just wonder how long they can keep doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:52:10
I seriously hope I don't have to pay 50$ for a transaction. That would destroy the purpose of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:16:10
Don't get me wrong I am a fan of BTC for a while. The community helped me earned an amount of money which people where I live with high income take years to make.  I have cashed out enough to ensure a small profit and the rest I am willing to HODL for the purpose of being a part of its technology improvement. I am just being very concern with people hyping up the price, not the technology advancement. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:18:20
This is the sole purpose of why we have this community at the first place. We put our money into a system that isn't a banking system so all of us can create a value that, whenever a member of a group need to cash out to do something meaningful, he/she can do that instead of seeing all of our saving slowly losing value just to fund bad things like wars. There is no system can perform what Bitcoin has been doing, including the insurance system. Keep up the good work and remember the community was built on not only the price from the market, but mainly the belief of a brighter future and advance technology.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:11:20
Agreed. But you do know that when the production cost of an unit is higher than its value it can lose customers, right?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:15:41
Did u see the title? I didn't make this for entertaining purpose. 
There are many of our crypto leaders already called out BBC as a scam. However, they have been running it for more than a year. How can they still be running?
BBC make people transfer BTC to their coin so they do have some in reserve. Coincident or not, the price increase of BTC (in average) is much higher than the interest rate that they are paying out (at around 40% a month). 
Based on my experience coincidence doesn't happen too often in business when the whales are involved. I am just putting all the pieces of a puzzle together.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:36:27
It's a lending coin which we cannot mention name here due to the fact that this sub highly believe it is a ponzi scam. You can search it easily on google just type in BBC coin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:33:25
Thanks a lot for the input! Although I am a little concern about how much the value of the market has been rising, this helps me gain much more confidence in the tech going forward!
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:18:01

@_date: 2017-09-10 16:35:09
I got my BTC back to my trezor safely already. Just need Kraken to open my account since my BCHs are in there.

@_date: 2017-09-06 11:15:48
