Yes, but the real hot investment is the blockchain that underlies the blockchain

It is really  an investment unlike any other. 
You're placing a bet on the success of a very cool technology, the people developing it, and the ecosystem surrounding it. (A great bet, imo)
And while keeping an eye on your investment - how the system develops - you're simultaneously gaining from what it offers; Now you can store money privately with backups in multiple locations, now you can get massive discounts, now you can timestamp a document in the worldwide ledger, etc.

Bitcoin is to freedom of exchange as internet is to freedom of information.
It's already difficult to imagine a time before we could basically see and hear anything, and say anything to anyone.
I hope to someday look back at videos like this as a strange anachronism - from a time when people had to be up in arms about a freedom we now all take for granted.

Very nice indeed. They get to sell some benefits of the bitcoin network without the friction of training users on a new currency.

Good commentary, but it can really throw a reader when you build a case, asking them to put on their logical thinking caps, and then misuse a logic phrase.
No offense

Sweet. Now we have two ways to explain it to a non-technical audience
@_date: 2015-12-31 16:16:06
Yes. Sort of a Venmo that you can transfer in and out of at any time on the bitcoin network.

Ctrl+F found nothing.
However, managing an expanded transaction volume without additional cost (fees) or mitigation (lightning) means doing it for free, or in other words "no impact"

In a nutshell: Not enough impact from bitcoin is the problem and Tritium is the solution.
The article has to highlight a problem, so of course it minimizes that there has been some disruption already (or a lot, for a few people)
Good to see this motivation at the outset of any bitcoin project, though

I'm amazed you went to all the trouble of becoming a judge to make this happen, but thanks! Shapeshifting govt officials the new project?
