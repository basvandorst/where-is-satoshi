Any tool in the world could create a Gox account and start trying to scam them. Or they could just start hammering their servers without even having an account. Real exchanges don't have that feature. They talk to only a select group called "brokers". If Joe Public wants to trade he needs to go through a broker. The exchange does not deal with the general public. It does not hold their funds or their commodities or vet their lying account applications. It certainly doesn't let them directly connect to their servers. Brokers do all that and when things go wrong they are the ones that pay for it, not the exchange.

I think you place too much emphasis on what random minor politicians say. Politicians are mostly average schmucks who happened to get elected. They start with an average schmuck's understanding of how the world works. The people in the unelected permanent state have a much better grasp of where state power comes from. The idea of throwing away a major source of state power and revenue would be abhorrent to them. The  country goes bitcoin and suddenly
* most transactions go dark for them and become untaxable
* monetary policy disappears
* fiscal policy is hamstrung (no money creation power)
* seignorage is zero (no money printing)
* capital controls become impossible
Once they see bitcoin as a threat they will start leaking scoops to the mainstream media about how bitcoin is the harbinger of the four horsemen of the infocalypse (paedophilia, terrorism, drug cartels, and financial fraud) and suddenly Joe and Jane Average are clamoring for the government to protect their children from this monster. The elected politicians will follow. That hasn't happened because bitcoin just isn't that significant yet. I hope it never happens.

That has been the basis of the state for a very long time. States have "subjects" -- persons who are subject to their power, including the power of death.


They have power because they have overwhelming force, not because someone granted them a license. If they didn't have force on their side no license would make them the state. As time has passed the states' propaganda has evolved. The mandate of heaven has given way to the mandate of the people. The underlying reality does not change.

They don't have any need to destroy bitcoin but they probably could if they wanted to. e.g. they can slaughter a few roosters to scare the chickens and bitcoinl loses most of its value and all the ASIC miners give up because its not profitable and they don't like jail. Then a 51% attack becomes much cheaper. 
If they make mining, possession, buy and selling illegal then 99% of the population wont touch it and its price will implode. Sure a few die hards will run nodes over tor but so what? when it becomes unusable for almost everyone, mission accomplished. 
They've never managed to get rid of child porn yet they are sufficiently successful at making life hard for child pornographers that most people are terrified of inadvertent contact with it. The state could devote 100x the resources they currently do to child porn to tracking down and busting bitcoiners and it would still be only a small fraction of their security spend.

[Their earlier response]( during the ET[CH] split explains their reasoning more clearly.
The stock split is not a very good analogy for a couple of reasons. Stock splits are highly predictable, regulated events that market participants typically know of months in advance. Contentious chain forks are much less predictable. Corporate shareholdings are account based: ownership is determined by a share registry and whoever controls the registry can reallocate shares. Binding obligations can follow a share around as it changes hands. BTC is more like a bearer share that can randomly spit out a bonus share.

ASICBOOST is relatively trivial. PoW is fundamentally flawed. The equilibrium number of independent miners is one. Any miner can reduce the variance of his returns at next to no cost to his expected return by pooling with other miners. The bigger the pool the better.  And this is just the financial side. The potential rewards of being able to threaten a 51% attack are another reason for miners to band together.

That's obviously false. The market cap is irrelevant, what matters is the market depth. For example, in your case bitcoin has a current price of about 1e14/2e7, i.e. about $5,000,000. Say the current market depth looks like
Buyers: 1 at 5e6, 10 at 4e6, 100 at 3e6
Sellers: 1 at 5e6+1, 10 at 6e6, 100 at 7e6
Then the current market price is between  5,000,000 and 5,000,001, and the market cap is about $100 trillion. Yet any market sell order over $5e6 crashes the best bid down 20%.

You forgot to mention the invective directed towards anyone who mentions the things for which bitcoin is particularly useful, such as buying drugs, not paying taxes, and doing business or moving money without the state's oversight and approval. Apparently we are supposed to believe bitcoin is soon going to replace fiat in a few years, and so, because there are USD quadrillions of fiat but only 21 million BTC, the early adopters are all going to be USD billionaires if not trillionaires.
The main utility of bitcoin is in routing around state imposed inefficiencies and making previously difficult or uneconomic trades profitable. This is what enabling direct global person to person financial transfers at minimal cost does. I don't need bitcoin to buy crap on eBay, do my grocery shopping, or buy an apartment.

That is a good thing. The state has declared many legitimate markets to be criminal, so naturally those markets offer great profit potential.

In my years of experience outside the bitcoin world incoming bank wires became cleared funds in my bank account with a few days of their being sent. I've never heard of this business of the bank telling you you have an incoming wire and not crediting your account for two weeks.

Bitstamp have some other serious problems with their systems that I would prefer not to discuss because they have worked to my advantage. Bitstamp may be honest people but their trading platform is far from robust or even functionally correct.

If only they cashed out via bitcoin! the price would have rocketed.

Price leads volume through a simple mechanism: price spikes, MSM reports it, people google bitcoin. Evidence for causality in the other direction is scant.

No comfort on withdrawals at all! do they think people are going to be rushing to deposit when they have no confidence they can withdraw?

Tor maybe; don't trust VPNs to hide you from agencies of the state. Some of the most popular ones such as HMA are known to actively cooperate with LEAs.

I have had Bitstamp orders filled at my limit price when there were better offers. e.g. market is 130/131, I put in a limit buy at 140 (intending a market order) and it immediately fills at 140, despite there being 20+ offers in the orderbook at better prices.

Internet circa 1993, maybe. A couple of years before it exploded into the mass market. Not that that is a prediction. History never repeats, though it frequently rhymes.

Active traders need to be able to trust the exchange. You trust your stockbroker not to steal your money or shares. Why should bitcoin institutions be less trustworthy?

According to [Reserve Bank of Australia figures]( the average for cc transactions in Australia is about 0.8%. Diners and Amex are considerably higher, about 2% and 1.8% respectively. These figure are likely volume weighted.

A libertarian may ask what business is it of the state how much my money "flys about"? As much business as their guns can make it, is the answer. Monitoring, tracking and restricting what private citizens do with their money, even quite small amounts of money, is part of the new post-911 "normal" for Western states. Seize first, ask questions later.
Bitcoiners have to get used to hiding in the shadows. The idea that the states are going to allow bitcoin to grow into some sort of parallel currency comparable in scale to national currencies is naive.

Buy PayPal USD from a reliable Bitmit vendor. They use escrow and I haven't had a problem in ~100 transactions.

Mostly I wasn't thinking of them. Criminals of that nature do perform a service of sorts by exposing flaws in the bitcoin ecosystem. I think bitcoin's success will ultimately depend on their failure. If everyone is constantly getting their bitcoins stolen, bitcoin wont succeed and the criminals' bitcoins wont be worth billions or trillions.

Toss a coin 16 times. Record heads as 1 and tails as 0. Interpret the string as the binary encoding of a number N. Look up the Nth word in the filtered word list and write it down.
Repeat above step 7 times.

Sounds like a storm in a teacup. The dust issue has been dealt with and I imagine the equilibrium price of buying all of ghash.io's hashpower to do something profitable would be very high.
