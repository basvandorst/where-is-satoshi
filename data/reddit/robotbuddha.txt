1) High School student. If you think you were much wiser in the ways of the world, I think you're showing you don't actually remember what it's like to be that young.
2) I'm not funny. I can write about some things. I can also use a fill and text tool in gimp. If someone offered me a quick $15 and it was early enough in my trying to break out of the 9 to 5? Fuck yeah I would have taken it. If it was something I had any background in, like I assume they have talent with making a passable joke that'd have appeal to a teacher in a high school class?

The users of have proven themselves time and time again to be the most cruel and heartless of any subreddit I read. And that's really saying something. Time and time again I see people saying things like "why should I have empathy for X, they did Y." Just the fact that empathy can be considered conditional in a post, and heavily upvoted, says something really bad about a lot of people here.
I mean I'm kind of a terrible person. But even I feel bad for people who are in pain, no matter the reason for it.

You're at -6, while this post has 1220 upvotes at the moment. Actual criticism gets downvoted, while a "zomg mfw!" reaction gif gets that much positive attention? And people here are still in denial about why this subreddit is such a joke.

Because human beings are supposed to have empathy, independent of the reasons behind someone's suffering.

Oh for fucks sake, this post is at +3, the parent is at -1 right now. Both are just "in my anecdotal experience....". Just that one agrees with what people here want to hear, and the other disagrees.

I think it is. Well, more importantly the aspect of default subreddits is. I'm finding it increasingly common for people to just have subreddits rather than self hosted forums or even facebook pages for their particular goods and services. 
Every user who signs up specifically to post in a subreddit like that also has the default subs pushed at them. How those are managed will have an increasingly large impact on people if the trend continues. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:22:20
Pretty much why I always just directly give homeless people money or food rather than donating to established charities. True, there's the risk of the occasional person begging as a scam. But in general that's far less probable than a charity essentially doing the same. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:18:25
In a sense I agree. But at the same time I think you have to admit that downvoting doesn't work when it comes to memes. There's a huge percentage of users who will always upvote images that they can digest within a few seconds, especially if it's possible from a thumbnail. They always end up overwhelming people who vote based on any other criteria. 
That said, I'm not saying that they need to be banned. Just that the idea of them actually being controllable through voting doesn't go along with what I've seen happen in most large subreddits. I mean you get situations where 95% of the comments about one are people complaining but they still wind up jumping to the top.

I think the past two days are an illustration of just how ill equipped people are to really emotionally grasp the nature of very long term processes. Pro or con, it's not a good idea to extrapolate too much from a tiny point within a larger unpredictable process. Everyone knows that intellectually, everyone still does it though. If not within this specific topic, than some other.

Oh no, not the precious "I have a stick up my ass and no sense of humor" demographic! It's good marketing. Pikeadz did a good job laying out why it's a good marketing strategy. The demographic you're worried about wouldn't respond well to anything with that medium anyway since it would be best to try for feelings of social crusading and elitism which wouldn't work well with billboards.

Small stuff to some. But I think to the average bitcoin buyer this might be targeting the absolute essentials. Dominos can be more of a need than a want at times.

Yes. In the same way that is a laughing stock to most atheists.   It's not the issue that people are rolling their eyes at. It's the euphoric relationship the communities have to that issue.

I think it's a bit pointless to worry about what economists think of it. Doesn't matter whether they're for it or against it. Bitcoins touch on things they have solid understanding of. But it's just too dissimilar to anything else to really give them any more predictive value than any random guy on the street. Hell, if anything they might even be less qualified due to unconscious bias in favor of the familiar and against the unfamiliar. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 00:15:57
I really like slashdot, but at the same time the userbase has become more and more conservative over the years when it comes to technological change. I think the average poster there is very gungho for change and improvements in the technologies they grew up with. But at the same time they're freaked out by things that are actually NEW. They like gradual evolution in technology, but hate revolution. 
Basically tech nerds who grew up, started a family or career, and then no longer had the time to keep up with everything. Change suddenly becomes scary because it forces them to face that something they consider a core point of their identity isn't something they're hotshots at anymore. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:33:52
Kind of an amusing theory in a sub with 29k subscribers. Joking aside, and with some allowed fuzziness for exact numbers, that does seem right. Especially with that "but then a trueX springs up, rinse, repeat" bit added on.

One or two off days is being overly generous. It seems plain to me that they are trying, and aren't a scam or anything. But at the same time, they've had a pretty significant amount of issues. 
I loved their service in the past, and I even kept on trying to use them for a long time past when people were advising not to. I couldn't even get any of the transactions I attempted through at that point. I'm eager to return to them if they can get their act together. But at the same time, they never will if people aren't vocal about needing that change before they're willing to use them again. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:26:13
Man, that's just amazing. I especially love the fact that things are being built by the homeless people, for pay. That's often one of the worst things about being homeless, in my opinion at least. There's just this air of hopelessness about one's own abilities.

I might be less driven by ideology than most of the people here, but an 8th grade 550 word report? Fighting that would be like fighting for weeks to get the one cent back that a cashier shorted you. At least if it's as small a portion of your grade as I'm assuming. It was rejected, so you're within your rights to resubmit it to a different teacher or class at some point with whatever retooling it might need.
And really, glancing at the tips here you've probably made more money writing it than your teacher did during the time it took to grade your assignment and those of the rest of your class. Seems like a net win to me. 
Though to be clear, if it was a large part of your grade I do think it'd be worth fighting the decision.

It's often a seemingly minor thing that does it. Often times people are right at the breaking point. Then they have one really, really bad day and they just can't keep themselves going anymore.

Downvoted for being a worthless pic without any actual context of what the hell is going on. What city, what country, when, where, why, that's what makes a story. 
630 upvotes? This is why reddit sucks so much these days. Post what people want to hear and the story gets upvoted no matter how much context or factual information it lacks.

I have to wonder if that's more about people who are interested in bitcoins in and of themselves, rather than actually just using them. I know a fair amount of women who use bitcoins, but none of them really care about it beyond needing it as a means to an end. They all use bitcoins on a fairly regular basis but I don't think any of them care enough about it as an abstract concept to answer a survey.

Man, props to him. I might not be a fan of his professional work, but I really respect it when rich people do this kind of thing. It's easy to just toss a few bucks at a generic charity and feel like you've done your bit. It's a lot harder to actually research emerging technologies which could help the world and then help the people developing it. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:15:21
Agreed. It's not a fun sexy answer, but it's just the nature of things. Sometimes we're just stuck having to wait and see how things turn out. Nobody has enough solid data, background or predictive ability to know how this will all end up.

Motivation is needed to participate in charity. In a perfect world, just the act itself would be enough motivation. But we don't live in a perfect world. A little bit of novelty to the act, unusual methods to go about it, the feeling of using new things to help people, it can all motivate people in a way that traditional charity wouldn't. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:51
A big difference is that the slashdot voting system is also there for categorization. The funny vote also puts it into a category where people who don't want to see jokes can totally block it.

I mostly agree. But I think on the internet it's important to remember that not every poster is coming from the same culture or subculture. I was on my own at 16 and had endured more by that point than most spoiled middle class suburban Americans have by 25.

You say it like that's a bad thing. Say what you want about the rules, motives or whatever. But the end result has been pretty impressive to me in terms of getting people not really in the loop talking about it.

I'd agree on a flood of sites. The problem is that it depends on a flood of sellers. If I were one, I'd be pretty damn hesitant about jumping onto anything before a year or so has gone by to at least offer some suggestion that a site isn't a honeypot or scam.

Human psychology can be predictable within controlled environments. The further out you get from that the more it becomes educated guessing rather than science. Partially because of uncontrolled variables that it's literally impossible to be fully aware of. But also because the same studies which suggest patterns within those uncontrolled environments by necessity have to abandon what's arguably some of the most important fundamentals of the scientific method.

Or an attempt to get on the front page, grab karma, etc. At this point I'm a little skeptical of anyone saying their main goal was fostering discussion. Because one has to know at this point that any meme using post will be quickly derailed into a discussion about whether memes belong here.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:12:00


I wish. Memes are born and usually die pretty quickly there. I think the biggest influx of users are simply people who don't post much on the internet outside of facebook. So they find out about reddit and try to use it in a similar way. Funny picture, like! Wall of text post, don't have time to read it.

The huge percentage of people on reddit who've never been poor, or at worst have been 'lol starving college student" can get frustrating at times. I constantly see people on here saying that they should just get a better paying job, that they know the risks and took it anyway, and that basically if someone can be legally screwed over than there's no moral obligation to do anything but screw them over. It gets very "let them eat cake" in here sometimes. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:30:43
If I was stumbling on this subreddit with no knowledge of bitcoins I suspect I'd have just come to the conclusion that it was a scam. Those types of posts are exactly what you see on discussions of them. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:36:40


Great in theory, doesn't work in practice. When things have gotten bad enough that memes show up, the percentage of people who skim compared to thoughtfully consider the worth of votes is already too skewed to fix by voting. 
It sucks, and runs pretty counter to my own views of what makes a good site. But after seeing it happen again, and again, and again I just have to admit that it's the way things are.

I miss being able to just toss cash into the local moneygram machine with bitinstant. As much as I've heard reports of everything going smoothly again for people, that method hasn't worked with the local machine around here in ages. It might not have been quite up to the level of a coin vending machine but it was in the ballpark.

I was thinking about similar things in yesterdays thread with the millionaire. Someone commented that he and people like him deserved the fortune they'd received. Deserved, undeserved, right, wrong. When you get down to it, that's why there's really no point in trying to label things like that. There's just too much subjectivity, personal narrative, unknown variables or whatever. Switch another variable we didn't know around and the story would change again to make us admire him. Another and we'd be looking down on him again. One can feel it's right or wrong, but that's emotion and not reality. Then again it's also just that english is really fuzzy in some areas.

I think that's a very valid concern. I strongly agree with the value of bitcoins. But at the same time, a LOT of the praise people heap on it pretty nearly echoes the "well we'll sure show them!" language one sees on the forums about any scam. Of course the big difference is that payoff, and the utility are right here to see and judge. But I can see how someone might get a bad impression on seeing some of the more enthusiastic praise of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:17:17


I have full sympathy for the feelings of the people suffering through anything, independent of the actual circumstances behind them. But at the same time, you can't protect people by trying to babyproof the world. There comes a point when people just have to make mistakes, learn from it and grow as a result. The idea that one should never gamble more than they can afford to lose is a pretty basic aspect of life. As is recognizing gambles when they see it. And if anything better bitcoin where the odds aren't intentionally weighted against them as a learning tool for that than losing everything in a trip to vegas. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 04:43:39
For all the people who keep insisting that bitcoins are just money, this subreddit seems to never get that. It's always looking at it like some cause or special club or something. It's not for people someone likes, or dislikes, has things in common with or not. The target is everyone and every possible interest.

I think the difference is that most android devices don't have it removed from the play store AND take extra measures to ensure you don't get it from anywhere else either. Where apple has a monopoly on software distribution on the iphone, and takes active measures in an attempt to block people's ability to install anything from outside their system.
