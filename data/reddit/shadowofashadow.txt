Do you have any concern that they might be re-opening the site with the same vulnerability still out there? It would be pretty stupid but...they did sign txns with 1% of all BTC in existence in such a short timeframe, I wouldn't exactly put it past them.
That was my thinking when reading post.
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:49:32
They've delivered everything except an explanation of how they got hacked and proof that this was ever reported to the authorities. They've also not shown any attempt at bringing a third party in to manage this issue and be a trusted party between the users and the exchange.
I think those things are pretty important to settle people's concerns that this could be an inside job.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:40:11
Pretty crazy they won't negotiate at all, even for something like reduced-commission trading. They must think they are pretty safe.
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:20:19
Yeah I feel bad for Zane, he seems like a decent guy who is about to get the shaft big time by the people he works for.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:44:27
What do you mean? Because they'd have to manually approve and enter the PIN for each txn?
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:17:07
Manual withdrawals get a little costly in that situation though :)
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:18:10
Zane said they are manually approving all withdrawals so I'd expect a delay.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:18:45
Yeah I wonder if OP just found the easiest to crack account and used that.
I am still unsure, did the coins move to the second address?
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:05:27
Official meaning he had a well established account on LBC with hundreds of positive feedback and confirmed transactions. If we did it outside of the LBC system that doesn't get captured in his stats for making transactions I guess.
We set it all up through LBC before I even saw him, so he was basically just confirming the transaction once he got the cash in his hand. It went straight to the my LBC account where I did a withdrawal.
And yeah, I could have found someone else but it seemed legit. I ended up doing my next buys on an exchange though.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:26:24
Why is this posted in a bitcoin sub?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:47:27


Agora exited gracefully, so it's not a foregone conclusion for all DNMs.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:51:23


I don't think you should be thanking them for this, this should be a huge issue. Why aren't they communicating at all besides this zane kid taking all the flak?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:33:07
Sure someone can set a bot, but will anyone care in 10 years? Probably those affected the most, but most would have forgotten this hack in the sea of others that had happened since.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:06:57
Well they can always court order you to give them the funds, but without a bank in the middle to give in to the government's request you have the option to say no.
I'd be interested to see how it plays out.
I imagine you'd sit in jail for contempt of court or something along those lines until you pay up.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:28:59
To play devil's advocate, if you're already removed that 78.4% why not sue? What's there to lose? Someone fucked up here and I know some people are more motivated by justice than getting that last few percent back.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:44:18
That really sucks... but I'm surprised someone running a business like this isn't splitting their balance across multiple exchanges though. That's what I'd call diversifying in the bitcoin landscape. You can't trust any single exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:25:10
It does amaze me that we haven't really seen anything solid from anyone of any authority. No numbers, no law enforcement statements... just poor old Zane holding down the fort.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:44:35
Yeah I'm amazed how many people just blatantly ask for money.
 Not to mention if these really came from a hack I wouldn't want them near any of my wallets. Sounds like a fun way to get the authorities looking into your books.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:14:11
I don't get why LBC forces you to use their wallet anyways. The whole point of LBC is to find face-to-face deals, then I show up and the guy wants to deposit to my LBC account.
Seems silly.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:56:14
Ah, the guy I bought from made it seem like he had no choice but to send to the LBC wallet. Probably wanted it to be all official and above board.
I was like "you're asking me to break the number one rule about bitcoin?". I ended up going along with it and it worked out, but that kind of thing makes me very nervous.

Some people are more concerned with those responsible getting in trouble than getting their money back.
I did not have funds at Bitfinex so I cannot say which is the right decision. I agree that the money will be either gone or years away if this goes to the courts, but some people will want that anyways if it means the people who let this happen/did it get what they have coming.
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:19:31
This is why so many people have come to the conclusion that despite the apparent abundance in western society, we are in fact slaves.
Amazing story.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:39:36
Actually people were warning the regulators about Madoff for years. They "turned a blind eye".
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:32:25
I don't think is a representative of Bitfinex. He's saying we don't know, not that Bitfinex doesn't know.
That being said I still agree with you. I wouldn't put any funds into Bitfinex until they clearly explain how they were hacked in the first place.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:41:19


The criminals getting their punishment and not making out rich as hell, that's for one.
I doubt they can be caught, but if I lost money in this hack I'd want to see the responsible parties get caught.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:47:00
I really love all of these ideas from the piggy bank to the three deposits. Very cool!
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:24:24
Yeah, I guess it will come down to the specific agreements they had.
I'm in financial services and we do a lot of indemnifying of other firms so that we can get stuff done. I was thinking this could be a similar situation.
@_date: 2016-08-31 12:58:20
It's not even that. Major metropolitan areas only have a few days supply of food on hand. Everything gets shipped in by truck daily/weekly. If there was ever a major outage of the internet or electricity it would only take a few days before things got very hairy.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:54:30
Not only you
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:51:57
Yeah but why even give the option for a txn fee if they're just going to change it? I'd be pretty pissed too.
0.01 is a pretty huge fee too. I always choose high priority fee from trezor and it never comes close to that.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:19:54
Have bitcoins stolen like this ever been recovered in the past? I know analytic companies can sometimes find lost coins, but stolen?
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:57:26


What if no one actually knew what the mistake was, but you know it was the employees negligence that caused it. Would you be happy to let them start working again?
I'd want to at least make sure they have found and corrected the issue before going back to work.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:21:48
There was some info given, but it's sparse.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:24:00
Apparently he references it in the soundcloud recordings, so that would be proof. I can't listen right now to verify but there is a transcript posted above.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:57:45
No one really knows anything right now I'm just glad I didn't have any money in this one or I'd be pulling my hair out by now.
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:22:17
I don't think anything official has been said yet but I've been following as closely as I can and I think theymos probably has it mostly right.
Until Bitgo or Bitfinex admit to us what happened it's all speculation though.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:27:37
It's not anonymous, it's pseudonymous. Meaning people can track the coins but unless they can track one of the transactions to your personal identity they won't know who you are.
Anyways, you can thank the government for this. They are forcing BTC companies to utilize the normal financial regulatory requirements like KYC and AML.
Your best bet is to use a bitcoin ATM or do a face to face deal if you want to stay anonymous.

Right place, right time is a big factor. Me and my bro have similar personalities/skills but he makes more than twice what I do.  (I'd wager closer to triple) He dropped out first year uni and I went through and got a degree.
He just happened to fall into the right industry at the right time and away he went.
Being a person who can offer a unique skill at the right time to a person with money is the key to many people's success.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:44:30
Are you able to explain what some of the major issues are with a simple increase of the block size limit? 
I understand your point but you haven't actually explained what the issues are and that was more what I was looking for.
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:28:16
Zane is very careful about what he says. Ask him about what authorities are investigating and he says it the exact same way every time. If you press he refuses to give any more specifics.
Also asking how they know they are secure despite not knowing the attack vector gets you silence as well.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:55:26
Fair enough, I can definitely see your point. maybe I am just trying to sugar coat it.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:55:37
Yes and Zane will answer questions within minutes but if you ask him how they can be secure without knowing the attack vector he will not answer.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:16:57
I do. Have you ever heard the wisdom that says "never put all of your eggs in one basket"?
My point is that any funds held in an exchange are subject to being stolen. If you are engaging in the type of trading that requires you to have funds locked up for long periods of time in an exchange you should be spreading that risk out over multiple exchanges or, at the very least, only invest what you are willing to lose. 
Having your entire balance in one exchange is extremely risky as we've seen time and time again. I'm not sure why this upsets you so much.
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:33:03
Yeah I can't believe anyone is considering it when they haven't told us what happened in the first place. How can you be sure the issue isn't still there?
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:12:01
If you guys don't know the attack vector how can you claim the site is secure now? Just because you're keeping so little in hot wallets?
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:16:36
What about insider trading though? They aren't telling us anything about the actual losses, how many lawsuits they have against them right now, how much cash on hand etc. They shouldn't be able to trade those unless that info is public.
These tokens could be worth way more or way less than the market thinks and they'd be the only ones to know that.
That being said, if these people had funds in Bitfinex when they were hacked they might be the top holders of BFX without having bought any on the secondary market.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:49:07
Can anyone provide a summary? I'm a huge Corbett Report fan but haven't had a chance to watch this yet.
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:54:29
Can someone ELI5 why we can't just up the block size to 2mb, 3mb, 4mb etc? 
What is the risk, and why do we need these complicated solutions?
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:53:22
So probably either a full hack of some poor cam girls account, or a long-con troll.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:46:13
Yeah I'm just saying that if such arrangements were made I am pretty confident that Bitgo covered their ass legally.
Stupid thing to do if you're trying to brand yourself as being 100% secure.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:04:53
No it's not. I use exchanges and the balances are never on there for more than 24 hours. The BTC goes straight to my cold wallet as soon as I can withdraw it.
I might get caught up in a hack but the odds are way smaller than if I left them there all the time.
Not everyone can use LBC. Hell, even on LBC they hold it in their wallet until you withdraw. Unless you're doing all of your BTC business face to face you're going to have to 'hand over the keys' sometimes. You never have to let anyone hold them for long though.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:38:57
I always thought you were right, but how does this topic prove it?
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:25:21


I imagine if this is the case then there are many documents signed by Bitfinex absolving Bitgo of liability in this situation.
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:56:49
Well I didn't say I didn't have time to watch, I said I haven't had a chance to watch it yet.
I was at work when I posted that and I saw the video in my feed near the end of my lunch, which is why I was aware of it but hadn't watched it yet.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:47:52
Has anyone tried calling the FBI and finding out if there is an open investigation going on?
This guy had to call around but was able to make the British cyber police aware of the issue, although he is taking a different approach to the whole matter... might be worth calling and seeing if anyone even knows this happened.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:42:06
Yeah I asked on legaladvice just to see what people thought and it sounds like there is no real way of accepting these coins legally unless this person is totally unrelated to the hack just doing this for fun or something....
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:41:15
I think it can apply in this context since the number 1 piece of advise everyone always says when it comes to bitcon is whoever holds the keys owns the coins.
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:42:55
I don't think the wallet itself matters as much as where and how you obtain the coins. That's how they're going to link back to your identity.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:58:44
Yeah I guess you can do it like that, but the guy I did it with was very official and wanted to run everything through the LBC system so it was captured I guess. It ended up working out fine, but it felt a little iffy since I had no guarantee those coins would leave LBC and make it to my wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:51:24


I agree, I was actually trying to find a middle ground. 


I'm not sure why you think I'm talking about you personally, but it sounds like you did exactly what I'm suggesting. I doubt you are in as hard a position as OP because of it.
I will agree, you cannot be a BTC trader without leaving some BTC in an exchange. I probably should have clarified that I meant balances held at an exchange for unnecessary amounts of time, not BTC that you have tied up in an order. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:29:35
And since they pay no interest or dividends, is there any incentive to redeem them ever besides PR?
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:44:04
They only cited the amount of data breaches in US banks. What about physical theft and other types of fraud that cost them money? I bet most banks get taken by a fraudster multiple times a year. It's part of the cost of doing business, although it's usually passed on to the consumer.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:34:09
Crazy, that really makes me wonder what shady stuff is going on.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:05:00
I did not know that. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:22:46
From my experience most people think day trading/technical analysis is too much of a gamble and not worth discussing.
If you want that talk you need to go to @_date: 2016-08-23 16:36:42
Yeah it sucks but I wouldn't let it turn you off completely. Find a reputable site and do it one time and you should be set.
I'd use localbitcoins, it requires minimal information and then you can use it to find people to do direct deals with.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:51:20
I'm not sure what is the best option, but for such a long outlook I don't think the Trezor is right. I have one and I love it, but you still have to store your seed words somewhere safe. 
Also who knows what updating the firmware and trying to use one will be like in 10 years! You're going to end up relying on your seed words anyways and the trezor will have been more or less useless if you're just holding.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:40:01
Yeah there always has to be something linking you to it at the end of the day. If you're careful you can avoid that.
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:22:36
I see what you mean now.
The title is being made in reference to Kim Dotcom's new venture which will use the blockchain and bitcoin heavily.
So the OP is saying he understands why Dotcom is showing so much love for bitcoin these days after having gone through what he's going through right now. 
Obviously he did not discover his love for bitcoin soon enough, as you've noted ;)
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:19:48
Lol... wow.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:23:35
Well that's always a possibility if you're careful.
If the cops are trying to seize your coins though, I'm pretty sure they know who owns them. That's the context I wrote the post in. Being careful with your coins and transactions so no one knows you own them is the best way to go.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:27:14
I don't think 125k coins is enough to have an effect like that, at least not one compared to the value of 125k coins.
It would be a huge risk for an even riskier gain IMO. Way easier to sell them or use them to cover short positions.
@_date: 2016-08-02 13:42:08
They say no one is talking about it but you mention a name like Peter Schiff and people say he's nuts or is a doomsayer... well no wonder people think no one talks about this stuff, the problem is actually that no one listens.
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:27:41
I appreciate it. The first ELI5 was a little too simple, this is more along the lines of what I was looking for heh. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:31:39
We'll be famous :)
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:03:09
There is no indication that this is the truth. In fact from some of that teamspeak talk it sounds like they don't know what happened.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:04:56
He said not to leave any money in exchanges, not to stop using them.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:40:33
You better call a lawyer right the fuck now if this is for real. You're in receipt of stolen property and if somehow you get away with keeping it have to pay taxes on it as well as a million other concerns.
Do not do this alone.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:26:30
I'd pull my funds out because I don't trust that they've found the hack vector and patched it in such a short time.
Either they were extremely inept and lost it to social engineering, or their site has a major vulnerability that needs to be addressed. We don't know, so I wouldn't trust them again.
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:17:43
Thanks. I'd seen some people saying the terms of the BFX coins wouldn't necessarily be enforceable or apply to everyone depending on their jurisdiction.
But your post is pretty clear.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:33:23
Is bitcoin really the most volatile asset in the world? What timeframe is that based on? I have a hard time believing that actually true.
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:24:54
I have to say that's pretty ingenious. Get access to the forum account, update post saying you need to donate 0.001btc and change address to your own.
They almost made an entire BTC from it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:12:32
It's bullshit but is there any reason not to post an address in there? If it's fake there's still very little risk, right? Or is this just one tick against you in the security by obscurity defense?
Hell, I'll just make a fresh wallet and post an address from it.
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:17:53
Isn't the wisdom to never invest more than you are willing to lose though? It seems like many people around here don't take that wisdom very seriously. That's a LOT of bitcoin to have out there in someone else's hands.
Maybe in this instance that was the amount he was willing to lose, but I've seen more than one person say they lost "everything" in this hack.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:13:49
Holy shit are you saying [this thread]( was made by the Bitfinex CSO?
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:17:18
Great detective work there, Lou.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:38:05
Seems a little crazy when they are about to steal $80MM... but maybe they didn't know how much they'd actually be able to steal and wanted some leverage in case it was only a few thousand BTC?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:55:39
Yeah a lot of people try to call him out on the details but he tends to see the bigger picture before most other places do.
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:13:20
Read between the lines.
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:12:14
Imagine if the hacker started sending out random chunks of BTC to random active addresses? He could send as much or little of it to himself and on one would ever know. 
If he could disperse the funds in a seemingly random fashion they'd no longer be seen as tainted.
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:58:10
You don't even know what the hack was though. How can you be sure they patched the vulnerability?
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:23:42
Nice imagination but I don't see why they'd use her account where she admits to being a cam girl etc. Seems easier to just use a throwaway.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:29:12
helix light was always my go to, worked great.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:09:36
Good point, just usually there is some sort of press conference or something official even just to acknowledge that the funds were stolen and they are looking into it.
@_date: 2016-08-11 18:17:17
Did the coins actually move to either of the addresses? If so, was it the first or second?
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:41:31
Humans are short sighted and forget/move on to other things. I really doubt in 10 years people are going to still be searching for these coins.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:03:14
A bank bailout and some more QE and I can see it happening ;)
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:53:15
Yeah most of the technical discussion is in the daily topics so check those stickied at the top of the sub.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:47:56
You have your 12 seed words so you should be able to recover it on a third party wallet.
You can also hook up to another wallet software like Electrum and spend your Trezor funds there. With an USB OTG cable you can use phone wallets like mycelium too.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:00:26
That's not the point. When you're an upfront business and you get robbed you call the police.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:11:02
Looks like it's in the controversial queue.
EDIT: Sorry, misread your post. I can't find that specific post but I remember reading it, or very similar ones, yesterday. Seems like they paraphrased a few different posts.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:14:01
They did say they plan on explaining how they got to that number.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:43:23
I don't think we've been given any specifics yet, just that the coins were in 2FA wallets so whoever did it had access to 2 of the 3 private keys. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:13:45
Wow I've been following this closely but had no idea they haven't sent a single communication to clients directly/unsolicited. That strikes me as particularly insane.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:30:37
I did a 20% RRSP withdrawal and invested it into BTC and thought I was going to have a panic attack. It wasn't even a consequential amount of money in my life, but I sure as shit took it seriously.
I don't get how people can sleep with their live savings not only in BTC, but on a fucking exchange. I'd be checking my balance 40 times a day. Hell, I have a trezor and I still check my balance on occasion just in case.
If I had my life savings on an exchange I'd probably have a heart attack within a week. It would be all I thought about.
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:10:42
It's a reason we all should. Asset forfeiture is bullshit.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:51:51
Yeah I don't buy it either, but it sure is interesting. Someone has those coins to play around with and I can't look away!
Also, why would he give away 1000 untainted coins when he just stole so many BTC that people are watching? You think they'd be valuing their untainted coins way higher than the ones everyone is paying attention to.
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:08:03
I imagine he needs to keep that ruse up if he ever wants to touch US soil again. Lots of people already hate him enough.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:22:34
I think it gets lost in the discussion, but people are really trying to say that you should never let anyone else control your coins for any significant amount of time, and the longer you do allow that the bigger your risk of losing them is. Anyone who says to *always* hold them isn't thinking of reality.
If you're a day trader it becomes difficult to control your coins, but for anyone who isn't planning on spending their BTC soon, it should be in your own wallet until you are ready to spend.
I get very nervous when I'm selling or buying coins. I leave them on the exchange for as short time as possible and I am anxious the entire time they are out there.
People need to stop being so comfortable with someone else holding the keys and start thinking of it like any investment. You never invest more than you can afford to lose, and you should never hold more BTC in an exchange's wallet than you are willing to lose.

I agree incompetent is not the right word, but he's not being upfront with the community. Obvously I know why, but he's on here posting as if he's being open, while obviously avoiding certain situations.
I think at this point they should just do a press release explaining their position and leave it at that. Having a PR person who picks and chooses what they answer while acting like nothing is wrong is just going to keep pissing more people off.

This is exactly what I did. I unsubbed out of principal and then when I realized that the others subs aren't going to provide me with a stream of bitcoin news and discussion like this sub is, I resubbed to stay in the loop.
I don't know enough to have an opinion either way, I just know that censorship is not the right way to go. I'd like to unsub from here to show that, but I'm not sure where I'd go to stay up to date on all of the news.

That's the rub. The US dollar has done really well this year but that's when you compare it to other fiat currencies. It's buying power vs. when it was originally minted is probably significantly reduced. (as most inflationary currencies naturally would progress)

Wow, I've never seen it put like that before. That's pretty eye opening.

I don't think this news really goes against that idea. The US markets are in a massive bubble and the government is doing everything to can to stave off the coming recession. The dollar will crash, but it's not going down without a massive fight.

I was actually thinking about this the other day and how it's a bit of a catch 22. The problem I kept coming to though was once Mastercard introduced cyrpto to the masses, why the fuck would they keep using mastercard?

In this specific situation I think what the guy did was fine. It's like finding a wad of cash or certificates in an old coffee can you got. 
On the other hand, if you somehow gain access to a private key and you know who the owner is or you know they want those coins then it's stealing.
I see the OP like any old garage sale score though. Some people don't know the value of what they have or aren't even aware of the contents of the package they are selling.

That's a good point actually! It would be a pretty risky transition though as many of the benefits of bitcoin canabalize their current revenue generating products.

Yes. At that point the security aspect of your money is in your hands and you are responsible if it's stolen. In the event that your money is stolen from a third party you always have recourse as that third party is responsible. This part of what you get for your money.
Fortunately bitcoin is pretty secure if you're careful, but you can still find plenty of stories of people having pretty big bitcoin balances being stolen. Almost always it's a hack or a careless user, and usually when it's a hack it's still a careless user.

I don't think I am. The difference though is that if bitcoin crashes it will most likely be because adoption never panned out and demand falls. It will play out naturally and it will be my fault for investing in a failed experiment.
If the dollar crashes it's probably because some guy in a suit who thinks he knows better implemented some monetary policy or printed more dollars that make mine less valuable, probably as a result of mistakes the institution he works for made.
The psychology behind both scenarios is totally different.

When I told my dad the price was up right now without any real indication of why, he said maybe it's a good time to sell.

I don't because it's not enough of a gain for me yet. Personally if I withdrew today I'd be up quite a bit and I could buy something nice like a used car and pay off my CC, but it wouldn't have a profound effect on my life in the long run.

Just continuing this thought, but maybe the fee market for bitcoin is so disjointed because of how different the applications can be and the fact that we're looking at the entire btc ecosystem as a whole.
For example, you pay a fee to send Western union or a bank draft, but you don't consider that a "dollar" fee. It's a fee for a certain type of transaction, and different types of transactions are appropriate for different situations.
But, due to the way bitcoin works your transaction could be to buy a yacht or it could be buying a cup of coffee and you're still utilizing the same channel. So, someone buying coffee could pay the same fee as someone buying a yacht. Obviously in that case there's a big chance for the person buying the coffee to feel they paid too high of a fee. But the one buying the yacht probably feels the opposite.
Not quite sure where I'm going with this, but I think this is an obstacle we have to address when discussing this fee situation.

And to send him the extra grand... sorry man but you made some very bad decisions.

I disagree.
If I endeavor to do something and end up failing that's my responsibility, a lesson I can learn from. If someone else sabotages me then the failure is completely different. Not only is there no lesson, there is an opportunity cost as well.
I'd rather take the risk and make it my responsibility than put my life in someone else's hands, at least I can say I had a chance.

This is a possibility any time you did not mine the BTC yourself.
You have absolutely no control over where the coins have been and this is a pretty common complaint I see when people talk about doing blockchain analysis and "colouring" coins. It's not fair and it makes no sense. It's like saying because this dollar bill was used for drugs at some point it should be removed from circulation.

Thinking about it now... would they be able to mount a 51% attack by artificially bloating their blocksizes to appear like they are doing more of the work?

Maybe if he backed some of his points up he'd get less downvotes. Do you really belive bitcoin usage/adoption has been flat or gone backwards in 2014? There's no way in hell that's true, and if it is I'd like to see some numbers. Maybe bitpay/coinbase has been flat but bitcoin continues to grow.

@_date: 2016-01-06 18:57:19
I always thought this was obvious. People ask why bitcoin has any value, it's just numbers ,but the intrinsic value comes with the design and power of the blockchain.
Before it existed you could not store or exchange value without involving a centralized third party. (let's stick with money and ignore barter)
That's what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, the ability to do these things without having to trust some single entity that could decide to fuck you over.

Everyone is waiting for the price to go up if the ETF is approved. People have stop-buy orders set so that if the price starts to rise they automatically buy in, riding the rocket upwards.
So, if the order book is thin (meaning not a lot of buy/sells out there) a whale with enough money can buy up enough of the orders to push the price up. As soon as it hits that threshold where people set their stop-buys they trigger a whole bunch of buys and the price rises even further.

@_date: 2017-01-09 16:42:54
1. There is always a spread between the buy and sell rates. Yes this typically covers transaction costs but also is just the nature of markets. Google "spread" for more info on why.
2. Depends on the platform, but you should be able to lock in your transaction and then it will not change. Usually once you finalize things and the funds go into escrow the price is all locked in.
3. Depends on how clogged the network is but I've never had to wait more than an hour or two to get the coins in my wallet.

Yeah that's how any currency so works so that's a non-starter IMO.
The thing that makes a ponzi a ponzi is that the payouts are not genuine reflections of any earnings, they are simply churned deposits from new customers.
There is no way this is the case with bitcoin since it's a third party market after the bits have been mined. Who's doing the churning and the payouts? 
The fact that the payout is paid in BTC also makes it not a ponzi. The miners can continue to mine even if there was not a single new deposit or person using bitcoin, it's a self sustaining economy.
You could also continue to sell and trade bitcoins even if the amount of people using bitcoin today was the amount of people that would ever use it. It does not require new deposits to be churned in order for anyone down the line to get paid so it's not a ponzi.

I got a GTX 1080 which is worth about $1000 CAD for 1 bitcoin that I spent $300 on. That felt pretty nice.

Yeah I'd say that most companies work their way up. Not that many people have the funding or the vision to go balls out from the start.
Amazon was special because the person who started it had vision and was able to see the landscape 20 years out. They didn't even care about books, they chose books because they were a good vehicle for their online delivery service.

Yeah I would really love to try it but I'm dealing with large, established companies so it's usually hard to get anyone to try anything new.

I had an interesting conversation with my dad. I told him that bitcoin has been on the rise again and is about to cross $1000 and there wasn't really any obvious reason why. He's an oldschool finance guy and he said that maybe this is a good time to sell.
I said the exact opposite is true, because if btc is rising this much based on nothing just imagine what it will do when it expands and starts being used as a day to day currency.
He smirked. Probably still thinks I should sell lol.

As much as I love bitcoin there are some reasons why you would want to keep a bit of money in the bank. Deposits up to $100,000 in my country are insured for example.

Not sure how versed you are in the bitcoin landscape but this is the number 1 issue right now in the community.
Some people think we should take quick steps to alleviate the issue and deal with the fallout as it comes.
Others support a more complex solution that will naturally take longer as it must be designed and vetted like any good code is.
The point to remember is that this is not how Bitcoin has always been and it is not how it will remain. Things will get better as the community works through the issues and improves the protocol.

I wouldn't feel bad about not being able to articulate an answer to that. It's an absurd notion so it's tough to explain why it's wrong.
The easier thing is to ask them to explain how it fits the model of a Ponzi and then you can shoot down the stuff they say...if they even try to back up the notion that is. Most don't have any idea what they're actually saying and will change the subject lol.

I'm a huge believer in bitcoin but I agree, it's kind of like suggesting that someone spend their last $10 on a lottery ticket.

It's a legitimate concern for people trying to use it as a currency.
I know they don't get a lot of respect but people on the darknets are having all types of problems right now. If you try to fund an order and the price drops $100 before you can get the transaction in it's not great for doing efficient business.

Trezor has USB2Go functionality so you can actually do something kind of like this already. Just plug it into your smart phone and sign transactions on a wallet like mycelium. They just need to open up the ATMS to accept transactions directly from the trezor.
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:02:53

@_date: 2017-01-25 13:50:35
I'm not sure you're right. In my experience bitcoin really was  almost instant and almost free. I used to send my friends a few satoshis just to show them how wallet software worked and it was never an issue. I'd never try that today knowing that I could be looking like a fool while we wait for the transaction to confirm.
So were they lying or did things change?  Maybe this is just growing pains, but I don't think they were lying when people used to call it fast and cheap.

It's nice seeing a positive article about bitcoin in a publication like this, but they can never just be straight up positive can they? They always have to get a jab in.


Let's not tell our readers that bitcoin is up 300% ytd and that the 33% drop still left the price higher than its been in 3 years...

So from the buyer's perspective, what possible benefit could you get from buying the key instead of having the coins sent to your wallet? Seems like there are only downsides for the buyer.

As long as we agree that my opinion is not valueless, I'm happy. I'd agree with you that my opinion is not as valuable as those who are directly involved in the development of bitcoin, it seems like the community is starting to forget about the end user and their experience. We'll never make it to the moon if we only attract devs and hodlers.

So your argument has changed from "central banks make sure the economy doesn't go to the shitter" to "economies with central banks have fewer recessions/depressions."

I say let anyone post that stuff here then. If it's that ridiculous it will be downvoted. I'm not a big fan of moderators picking and choosing what gets to be posted. To me this site is designed to more or less moderate itself.

Also not every wallet has control over the fee or a good algorithm for determining what fee to use, and not every transaction is under the user's control. Maybe it was sent by an ATM or another party who fucked up the fee?
The point is we need to stop blaming the users and focus more on a solution. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:22:53
I've had the exact opposite experience. I find people in this sub far more harsh and willing to go to ad hominem. It's really hard to ask a question here if it's not supporting segwit without getting shit on. Maybe it's not everyone but there are a few very vocal users here who talk down to anyone who isn't fully supportive of segwit or core.


The moderation policy is as strict as it has ever been. Did you know that the recent topic about high fees that was on the front page had over 25% of its posts deleted by mods? What good is that doing for this community?

The answer to this question will depend a lot on what you're doing with the money too. If you're investing long term I wouldn't worry about it. If you're day trading this amount will be very important.

I get what you're trying to say and many years ago I would have agreed strongly, but it really doesn't go against their ideology at this point.

I think you'd be surprised how many people who  are weary of core are still 100% in on bitcoin and aren't really considering altcoins or pulling out. I think on both sides of the debate there is a vocal minority that give a slanted impression of where the community is really at. I still believe we agree on more than we disagree on :)

Here's what I don't get about bitcoin forensics. You can see where the coins came in and where they went out, but unless the addresses in between are already known how the hell do you know who is in control of the coins?
If I create a few paper wallets and send the coins to them and back out to a fresh wallet, how does anyone determine who owned those paper wallets? It seems like a few jumps between unused addresses would be enough to kill any trail.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:50:49


While I do think the problem can be overstated by some, I think the only proof you need that this is a real problem is to go and look at the communities that use bitcoin the most, namely the darknet markets. 
It's easy not to notice some txn delays when all you're doing is moving sums of money around but if you want to use it for commerce and actually buy things then those delays can suddenly mean a lot. 
Pretty much any time the mempool backs up and transactions start taking longer to confirm you have people rushing to asking what the hell is going on and asking if bitcoin is broken, if they got phished  etc.
I recognize that bitcoin has many use cases and it doesn't necessarily need to work for buying things like a cup of coffee to be successful, but I think the darknets offer great insight into the struggles a person has to go through as a regular, end user of bitcoin. 
I feel like the usability side used to be a huge focus of bitcoin developers and that attitude has changed from "what can we do to make it easier for these people" to "if they can't figure it out that's their problem".

Maybe the problem is that people treat their bitcoin like any other password protected system they use?
I know that I have my seed words backed up in ways that I wouldn't dream of doing with my e-mail or banking password. If you want to use bitcoin you are taking a certain amount of responsibility into your own hands and you must take steps to be responsible.
I don't think bitcoin has to compete directly with the banks in that sense, it's just not going to be for everyone because everyone does not want to be responsible for their stuff like us bitcoiners do. For most aunt Susans a bank account is just fine. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:23:04
I think you have every right to feel that way, but speak for yourself. Blocking other users from participating in a community because you're annoyed with their words is a very shitty thing to do and detrimental to the community.
You were able to respond to this post in a reasonable way, why is that not good enough? if you don't like what people are saying and don't feel like responding then downvote and move on with your life. I've been on reddit nearly 10 years now and time and time again I've seen subs destroyed by overmoderation. It just kills any good will there is in the community.

Becuase they thought Hillary had it locked down based on the skewed poll reporting.
You can actually see the same thing with the Brexit vote. In a lot of the polls after the vote people said they didn't vote for staying becuase they figured it was a lock.
Hell, I know someone who voted for Trump despite being a Hillary supporter because they wanted to send Hillary a message that she isn't just running away with this thing.

You could be right. I've never been able to find any real, solid info on the Rothschild conspiracy even though I've been reading about it for years. 
I just felt the need put my hand up when I see things like "if they earned it then good for them", because as much as I love capitalism you can't deny that people in positions of power can do very scummy things to consenting people. The moral issue comes whether or not they felt coerced into consenting because there was no viable alternative.
Anyways, I digress. The idea that we should focus on the industry as a whole and not some boogie man is something that I can agree with. So cheers to that.

In mid 2015 I made a huge decision to cash out 20% of my RRSP and put it into bitcoin. Bitcoin was up a bit but I just had this feeling like the markets were overbought and bitcoin still had a long way to go.
I cashed out, bought bitcoin and the price promptly tanked $100. I was really bummed out but I was in it to hodl, so no looking back.
There was tons of temptation to sell though and just get the cash out.
But here we are today and my value has tripled. If I had acted on emotion I would have been REALLY bummed today.
My only regret today is that I haven't got my finances in order enough to buy more.

I'm not the smartest when it comes to this stuff but since no one else is answering I'll give it a stab.
1. A bitcoin earned by mining has the same value as any bitcoin out there. The value is derived from the utility of the blockchain and is boosted by traders, investors etc. 
2. It will become a fee market and you'll be rewarded with fees for securing the network.
3. I'm not quite sure what you mean. The network is still secured by everyone and the people doing that job take a little off the top. I don't think it breaks the trustless system bitcoin is meant to be.
4. This one is over my head.

Well their core business is keeping people's money safe from theft. At least that's how I'm told it all started back in the days of smiths and their vaults.
They've evolved into a lot more than that though, and how they make their money is probably a discussion that can go on for pages.

I have a trezor with my seed words hidden in the house somewhere. I explained to my GF that if something happens, grab the trezor or the seed words and go to a trusted friend and you should be able to recover them. 
I didn't bother trying to explain how to actually recover them because I think it would turn it into some big thing and she'd probably get bored and stop listening to me lol.

Looks like borderpatrol still posts. The guy was such a blockhead he sent all of his tips to the coin eater just so he could claim he didn't own any bitcoin. What a dummy, he could make the same claim if he converted to fiat.


He should have implemented his own solution, dummy.

Do you have any proof of this? As far as I can tell bit torrent is just as popular as it has ever been. It's not as easy as it was to find the sites but you can still google for just about any show or game and find a torrent for it in the first few results.

I still see a lot of people putting money into GICs (fixed income, called T-bills in the US)
But the rates are so damn low you have to have A LOT of money for it to mean anything, and then you're typically only covered up to $100,000 if something happens.

I left my GF my trezor and the seed words and told her to go talk to my brother or someone who knows technology if I happen to die and she needs to access the coins.
It's not hard enough for someone remotely familiar with tech to figure out and trying to explain her the instructions now for something that feels so distant and non-material, I know she'd forget the next day.

Unless you hold long enough that bitcoin becomes a viable option for buying general goods.
I already took a "profit" out by spending 1 bitcoin on a $1000 video card. I only paid $300 for that bitcoin so I realized a great gain there.

Oh shit, a phd disagrees with another phd, quick, someone tell me what to think!
But for real, I can't believe how many people don't recognize that the underlying value of bitcoin is the blockchain itself. A trustless way to store and exchange value across the globe instantly. There is no comparable alternative and that's what makes bitcoin valuable.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:46:32
I wonder if they're going to sell and buy and then transfer back out to a private wallet. As long as they don't try to cash out through the exchange this might help them. How will we track them if they sell them at the exchange and buy new ones that are not linked to the hack coins?
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:46:28
I'm always bummed out that I didn't get into bitcoin in its infancy, but maybe I still got in early enough.
I bought in mid 2015 so I'm pretty happy right now, but just imagining the people who were mining when they were worth pennies makes me so jealous.
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:50:53
No vendor has ever been caught by tracing bitcoin to them.
Every vendor I've ever read about being caught either had their packages profiled after one is sent back as return mail to a fake return address or they were snitched on by someone in real life.
The blockchain would only ever be used for back tracing coins in these investigations. Like you know the person you're looking for and you want to prove they have coins that came from drug deals. The odds of using the blockchain to find your suspect are way lower.
@_date: 2016-12-28 13:30:10


...wouldn't bitcoin be the workaround in this situation?
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:23:49
Let me add a little perspective to why I think this.
First of all it's just a straight up [fact](
You have the CIA engaging in media influence as well as the relatively recent [repeal of the act that prevented domestic propaganda](
Really though, just look at the people who listen to the MSM and how their lives are lived. People lost their minds when Trump won because most of them couldn't even fathom it being a possibility. The MSM had drilled it into their heads that Trump was a nut and had no supporters. It was untrue.
Hell, they were just pushing the story that the electoral college was going to vote against Trump and even said they had a source confirming at least 30 electors would be switching theri votes to Hillary.
Meanwhile, yesterday happened and Hillary actually lost 7 electoral votes, the most in 100 years.
How can the MSM be this wrong? Do you think maybe they were actually trying to encourage electors to change their vote and not actually reporting the truth? That's what it seems like to me.  They have an agenda and it has nothing to do with letting you know what's going on in the world.
@_date: 2016-12-07 17:21:35
I was simply trying to explain that many people are subbed to without buying into everything that is promoted there. It wasn't supposed to be controversial, but you appear to be consumed by this us vs them mentality.

I share the lavabit story with as many people as I possibly can. Most have never heard of it and most who have heard of it don't really understand the weight of what took place.
We throw the word hero around a lot but the people at Lavabit truly are heroes.
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:44:04
I wonder if we will see the scarcity bypassed a little bit by other cryptocurrencies. If crypto really takes off there are going to be a lot of similar options to bitcoin.

It's going to depend on the inputs.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:59:40
Spot on. And at some point you have to take a step back and ask yourself, if there was nothing to that story at all then *why* was every major media outlet pushing it so hard?
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:26:55
Makes sense in your situation, but I thought one of the huge benefits of bitcoin is that it was going to bring banking to the "unbankable". People in third world countries where a few cents can mean a lot of spending power.
I think we should strive to keep the fees as low as possible and not ignore this section of potential users.
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:38:08
I'm just saying that attributing the actions of a few members to a community of almost 25k people is silly. 
A lot of people are subbed there just so they can get all of the information out there. If some information is being blocked on this sub there isn't much choice but to go elsewhere so you are fully informed.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:54:53


My point was simply that one cannot rely entirely on one source of information. Getting your information from as many sources as possible is the smart thing to do.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:37:48

Trezor uses a combination of the rng from you computer and trezor device. I think it's pretty trustworthy.
You can generate a seed offline and load it onto the trezor but that's considered a lot less safe.
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:18:57
I'm pretty sure this has been a hot topic of debate on reddit for some time now. People want some sort of method to vote out the top mod if they are toxic and not working towards the goals of the community. I think it's possible that once or twice reddit admins stepped in on the really big subreddits, but as far as I know there is no way to oust the top mod, and usually if they're being that bad the response is to start a new subreddit and migrate there.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:07:56
It was better when I could send a transaction without having to worry if it would confirm or if the fee would eat a significant portion of the value.
I used to get my friends to download mycelium and then I'd send them a few bucks to show how easy it is. I don't do that anymore because there is a risk that the txn doesn't confirm and then I'm stuff sitting there explaining why the hell it's not as easy as I claimed.
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:46:50


Nothing unless it somehow undermines a goal of yours.


Him being the top mod of the sub gives him the right, unfortunately. No one can do anything until their name is higher on that mod list than his.
And just to clarify. he's a mod, not an admin. Admins are reddit employees, mods are just the people who created a subreddit or were added to the mod list.

It seemed natural for me but I've always used hd wallets and don't generate addresses myself.

@_date: 2015-08-05 20:11:27
Yeah I don't quite follow. Isn't the price just based on the current rate at which people are buying on exchanges, and even that depends on the exchange? So if someone needs a lot of BTC NOW and they move the market, did that just break the guy's equation?
@_date: 2015-08-08 03:51:46
Trezor does not store anything. Trezor generates seeds and signs transactions.
Your coins are on the blockhain and can always be retrieved without the trezor.

I'm not 100% sure actually. It's definitely not next unused address as mine showed one that already hadnone transaction and a balance. I think it goes up incrementally after youve loaded it.

You can always use multiple passwords along with your seed words so that you can give them the one with a few BTC in it while your main stash is safe. This works with the trezor I know for sure.
There's also the fact that if they kill you they lose access to the coins for good. It's not like a physical good where they can kill you and then ransack your house to find it.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:17:43
I emailed after a week and got no response. About week later I got a call and they verified me and everything worked well from then on.

@_date: 2015-07-07 19:28:41
Yeah this is something I never was sure about. If I encrypt a wallet I know no one can use that wallet.dat without the password, but can the seed still be used to steal my coins even without the password? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:35:20

Bitcoin can also be one of the best ways to ensure that your money does not get stolen.
That's one of the most interesting aspects about bitcoin...its weaknesses can also be seen as its strengths, it all depends on your perspective. Just like how security through obscurity is awesome until you lose your private key...

The algorithm heavily favors early votes so you can use a few bots to push topics up or down.

As a casual observer it appears to me that the top mod of this sub has some financial interest in keeping this discussion one-sided.

@_date: 2015-07-20 11:52:02
I got a trezor and used it to create a 24 seed wallet with a password on top of the 24 words.
What program can be used to recover this kind of wallet without the physical trezor device available? Electrum will take a 24 word seed but it doesn't seem to work with the password. It just keeps showing 0 balance.

At that point isn't it just another part of the VISA network though, and thus open to all of the expected problems that come with centralization?

Well what was your point? That Bitcoin is not going to work because it hasn't reached mass adoption yet? Sounds like a nice start to a thought, but then it just ends.
Everything has to start somewhere. Why is bitcoin's small adoption at this point in time a sign that it will not work?
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:58:22
Yeah mine went through fast last night too. I was just moving some coins so I dropped the last decimal place and used that as the fee. Turned out to be around 14 cents and it went through quick.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:02:17


I don't know, as a consumer that's not my job to figure out. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:36:53
So how is it that this guy wasn't able to hide these coins? Did he try and they found them, or was he not careful?
And the fact that the funds are moving means he's cooperating right? I've never seen any kind of situation like this involving BTC. I'm intersted in how it all played out.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:29:42
Agreed, unfortunately on reddit there is no way to oust the top mod, so we're fucked unless he steps down.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:22:48
So it's as simple as sending a low fee txn that gets seen as spam and doesn't get confirmed right away, and then following it up with a txn with a higher fee that is more likely to be mined quickly? How could this not have been anticipated?

Will do. It's nice to know you guys keep an eye on the community and are actively partcipating!
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:39:38
I've personally just been bumping up the fees as to me an extra $0.10 is immaterial. 
I think people have concerns, though, becuase bitcoin has always been sold as doing transfers more or less free. It's being seen as a negative because if we want to bring banking to people in third world countries those extra few cents could really matter.
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:41:52
Maybe you're right. I guess it depends on if this guy always dresses like that or not. I'm the kind of person who hates wearing a suit just because it's the thing we're supposed to do.
And hey, if he has information or knowledge that is valuable to them, it's their loss for judging a book by its cover!

Yeah wallets like Electrum have an option to use your trezor to sign transactions.

I agree compeltely. That's why all this regulatory oversight shit is just that, bullsht.
The regulators pick and choose who they want to harass.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:38:21
Interesting. So it sounds like you can create one set of seed words and then use multiple passwords to segregate wallets based on those same seed words.
Fancy. I still am not 100% on what would happen if you loaded the 24 seed words into something like electrum after using a Trezor to create them with a password. Would it need the password then?
EDIT: From reading a bit more it sounds like electrum would need the pass in order to pull up the addresses you put the coins in.. since the pass acts to salt the hash (god I hope I didn't mess those terms up hah)
@_date: 2015-07-24 15:32:57
I hid both in a different place of my house. The seed words are significantly harder to find than the trezor which is hidden, but close by so I can use it. In the same way you'd hide a bit of cash you hold.
I'm also thinking I should give a copy of my seed words to my parents or another relative in case my house burns down or something like that...
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:56:10
I have a piggyback question. What is the best practices for storing your encryption password if you choose to use one also? Would it be foolish to store it along with your seed words? If so, how would I set it up so my family could access my coins after I die if I chose a password along with the seed words?

Yeah I recently had this debate in my head. I have a trezor and wanted to secure it with a password along with my 24 words, figuring that if someone got the words they still couldn't get my balance because they need the password.
Then I start thinking about how this is supposed to be long term storage and if I am dead or unable to act, my family would still need that password along with the 24 words, so I'm either going ot have to store the password with the seed making it pointless, or have someone else hold onto it creating another possible break point in my plan.
In the end I just went with the seed words and a solid hiding place. Those other layers sounded nice but in the end they weren't actually making my wallet any more secure.

It also makes me wonder what kind of incentives they'd be able to offer their clients if a company like Visa did this... faster settlements is really all I can think of and that would require more than just the internal Visa system to use the blockchain if it was going to have a real impact.
I think this speaks volumes about the power of the decentralized model...lose that and you lose a lot of the benefits.

That sounds nice but the reason I was wanting to use cash was to avoid any third party holding our funds. I feel like trusting your money to an exchange is the weak link in the chain when trying to get bitcoin securely.
Unless I'm misunderstanding but it seems like at some point LBC is going to either be holding my money or bitcoins and I don't like that.

My dad was actually part of the company that developed the email money transfer system before it was acquired by Interac. It was originally called Certapay and had a lot of trouble starting up. The two guys who ran it were out of pocket about a million a month and after a year or two they sold to Interac.
The management was pretty tough as you could imagine a large company like that would be, and my dad was gone shortly after. It's actually become a really great system that I use all the time, but it's a shame that it didn't take off a little quicker. The big banks were hesitant to get on board before Interc's involvement which really hurt the adoption rates.

Quadriga is a little slow to verify accounts right now but once you're set up they seem to work really well.
I've also used LBC to find someone who I met up with and paid in cash. Those are the two easiest except for the ATMs that seems to be pretty prevalent in BC and Ontario. But you will be paying a preimum fee for those, so it's not good for large purchases.

Thanks, but as I said I already tried electrum and it won't work.
Electrum on windows doesn't seem to take a 24 word seed at all and electrum on tails takes my 24 or 25 word seed but it can't recover the funds when hidden behind a password.
Do I just enter the password as if it's the 25th word in the seed?

Yeah, that was my other thought. That's why I was wondering what the process was for them finding the coins. Did they just follow the blockchain and it was obvious, did he admit to which wallets he had control of? I'm just wondering how a guy who was on the inside and presumably knows the technology was able to get busted so thoroughly. The brilliance of bitcoin is that no one can force you to move your coins, so if you hide them well enough they should be there when you get out.
@_date: 2015-07-28 19:34:57

Actions speak louder than words and their actions have proven that they really don't give a shit about money laundering.

I'm getting in now. I wish I hadn't doubted myself so much or I could have bought in a bit cheaper! I was going back in forth in my head for the last month or so about what I should do and finally bit the bullet before the rally we had earlier this week.
I'm in this for the long haul though, I cashed out a portion of a RRSP to purcahse coins. That's how much I believe in bitcoin and how little I believe in the current system.
I'm one of those people who believes we're in for another 2008-esque market correction and I just didn't feel comfortable having all of my money in the market.
I'll probably try promoting it more once I get my hot wallet all set up and I can actually demonstrate how it works. I'm still a little disappointed in how few options there are to spend, but I know that will come naturally with more adoption.

I chased this rabbit for a while... I realized that in the end of the day I either need a really good hiding spot for the seed, or a really solid password I can memorize.
I opted for the really good hiding spot and praying that my house doesn't burn down. I also hide my trezor in a separate spot that is pretty well hidden, but I can access it quickly.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:41:08
Will do, thanks for your help.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:54:22
Great, thanks for the help. the locktime transactions sound very useful.
So I guess the password is useful for certain things but if you're looking at long term, secure storage there isn't that much benefit to using it as long as you're securing your seed words properly.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:28:13
Definitely. If it's any help to you I recently decided to use a Canadian exchange and searched Cavirtex on reddit. Saw the most popular/recent posts seemed to be talking about it shutting down and I had basically written it off without giving it a fair shake and looking close enough.
You being active on here and reaching out gives me some peace of mind and I will be definitely signing up and giving it a try now.

Alright, I'm thinking of taking the plunge and using some of my RRSP savings to buy bitcoin. I want to make sure they are secure but also not stuck on some paper wallet where I might not be able to get to them.

How does one protect themselves during a cash transaction from local bitcoins?

@_date: 2016-02-25 20:28:35
Hah, well I do have the seed words stored physically in a safe location, but I do worry that will be destroyed or lost somehow.
No matter how much you try to secure your coins there is always a weak point. I chased that for a while and realized that I was just making more and more complex password to store in different places. Decided to go the simple route and just write down the seed and find a really good hiding spot.
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:57:48
I agree with you to a point, people do get downvoted pretty heavily here, and for the record I didn't downvote you.
However I do notice that most posts that get such heavy downvotes very rarely ever have any substance. It's just someone ragging on bitcoin without actually saying anything of substance.
I think you need to actually bring something to the table if you want an honest reply. Saying bitcoin isn't widely adopted yetso it's doomed like beanie babies and then shitting on the sub is going to get you downvotes every time, it's a self fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2016-02-17 14:59:37
I'm sure many of them do. Lots had similar opinions prior to bitcoin though, I think you're generalizing a little much here.

I might buy this if there were evidence of bigger busts on a regular basis, but the cops are seriously behind on the DNM game.
There are huge vendors who have been around since the start and are still going fine.
Then again, if a vendor has good OPSEC the feds running the site doesn't mean all that much. And maybe they just run the sites to gain intel and then exit scam and keep all of the money for their next project? I would believe that in a second.

Well that's like spilling the beans on your offshore, secret accounts just because you got busted. Usually the point of a secret account is to be able to come back to it at a later time. 
I figured he'd be trying to stash these all over the place if he was stealing that many from such a high profile situation.


It's not like this is has never happened in the past. Even if it's unlikely that you'd get away with it the guy was a DEA agent who went rogue and tried to make himself a ton of money during a high profile case. I don't think him trying something like this is all that strange considering. Was he just hoping no one would notice and he wouldn't have to hide the coins?
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:15:36
Yep, which is why I'm weird for checking it so often ;)
@_date: 2015-07-29 15:42:34
Really? Can something not be good for one person and bad for another depending on their needs and technical ability? A strength cannot also be a weakness depending on the context? I think it's totally possible.
One man's treasure is another man's trash, just like one aspect of bitcoin can be seen as a positive factor from one perspective, and a negative from another.
Take irreversible transactions. They are great when you're doing trades for physical goods as the money can't be pulled back once the goods have been delivered. However, if you end up sending your coins to an address that no one controls, you're now out of luck due to the very thing that helped you in the previous scenario.
Control = responsiblity and responsiblity bites both ways.

@_date: 2015-07-22 19:37:00
The dangers with a hardware wallet tend to be similar to those of a paper wallet. Some aspects are slightly more secure like if you lose the trezor itself your coins should be secure, but you are pretty much in the same boat as a paper wallet otherwise. If you lose your private key(seed in the case of trezor) your funds are lost.
I can't think of anything that would make the trezor less secure than the other cold storage options.

It's because people see it as the only way out. Collapse is coming, it's the response from the government that is uncertain. Many people who recognize that the collapse would be horrible also feel that the government response could make things 10 times worse.
I don't think people think it will be easy, but they see it as necessary growing pains to improve the current system. That is why they hope for it, because as painful as it will be it's the only way out of the current paradigm.
@_date: 2016-02-17 14:02:11

As far as I know you pretty much can't get any of these services despite them being listed.
They are all scam accounts. I've never heard of anyone actually getting a gun through the dark net except for the one terrorist guy they trot around on the news and who knows if that's even true.
Hitmen services are 100% fake.  Do people really think there are people on there with the reach to do a hit anywhere in the world and that they'd be selling that service on the dark net? No chance. Logistically it makes no sense.

preppers get laughed at because they are associated with silly doomsday predictions, but when shit hits the fan economically they are going to be sitting pretty while everyone else scrambles to find an ATM with money or a store with supplies.

Listening to an interview with the guy who made it it sounds like he tried to cover as much as he could of that aspect.

They have their methods, but think of the volume of mail going through the post each day. If you make your package to look like all of the other packages and it's sealed so there is no smell or leakage, it's going to go through the mail smoothly and with little human intervention like 99% of the rest of the mail.

The definition of equate is as follows:


In my post I used rape as an example to illustrate the point I was trying to make as that is the only situation where I've ever seen the term victim-blaming used. If you feel that I was trying to equate rape to something else, please show proof of your point, because I have no idea how you came to that conclusion.
But hey, considering we're talking about the use of violence to coerce people into doing things, including locking them in a cage, maybe I will equate it to rape. I think that's a pretty good comparison now that I think about it, thanks for bringing that up.

I've been trying to call this victim blaming for a long time, since people seem to know what that means when used in the context of rape, but I just get downvoted to oblivion. Just because you knowingly broke an unjust law does not mean you deserved to be imprisoned or stolen from under the threat of violence, it means you're a victim of an unjust system.

When I did it I chose a guy with a ton of transactions and feedback and who had a verified ID/phone number with LBC in case I needed to find out who he was.
He also did the transfer into my LBC wallet using the LBC website functions, so there wasn't much chance he would try to double spend or something like that. It goes into my LBC balance and then I transfer out of LBC to my wallet.
I did mine face to face too though, so it felt a lot less likely to be a scam. This guy clearly was a BTC guy.

And this is exactly why you are losing the community. The only thing I've posted about that you dislike is the fact that this sub uses censorship. I, like many people, am not sure what the answer to the scaling debate is but I know something is funky when the mods at fight so hard to censor opposing opinions.
So you've just provided proof that I'm not a "great adversary to bitcoin" as you like to call me. I'm an interested party who feels like something shady is going on here. I might actually agree with your scaling platform, but it's hard for me to do so confidently without access to all of the information.
I'm the average user who is trying to find an answer, only to find silence on one side. This is what is tearing the community apart. And that is why even 10 months later I'm here mentioning the censorship, because I don't think it's right and anyone who is newer to the community should be aware that they are not getting the entire data set by staying here.

I see your overall point and do agree with much of it, but how many times can they go forward with their insane foreign policy and have it blow up in their face before we concede that this must be on purpose? Either that or they are so negligent they should all be fired or in jail.
Iraq, Libya... these places are in ruins now. Syria is going through the same thing and we are watching it happen in real time, and somehow we still let these people write our foreign policy as if they have the best intentions of the people over there in mind. Or as if they can actually predict the outcome of their intervention over there.
 It's crazy to keep repeating this fantasy that dropping bombs and shipping weapons is liberating anyone. And this particular instance is even more egregious since Obama tried to oust Asaad and failed due to public backlash. Now the public is practically begging him to go there. Ever read any Bernays?
And why would they want to do it?. I dont know, ask them.

I bought when it was around $400 CAD. It was on the tail end of a bubble that looked like it would keep going. Everyone was pumping it everywhere I looked and as much as I wanted a store of value and a vote with my wallet for something I believe in, I was thinking moon in the back of my head.
It took me about 2 weeks to get my finances shuffled around and I bought it, and the price promptly plummeted where it has stayed until just this week where it finally is back up.
So yeah, I'm agreeing with everything you've said. Making an emotional decision in this space is going to give you a bad time. I'm just holding now, forever. I will ride this out because I believe in the technology and the principles behind it, but I'm done watching the price.

I always really liked the comparison to napster and P2P. Napster was able to be taken down because it was centralized, and any bank can fail in the same way.
By decentralizing the most important part of a bank, its ledger, they've effectively created a system that cannot be corrupted by a single stupid or malicious actor, and they've also created a system that does not require trust, pretty much the first of its kind.

Considering they were trying to throw everything they had at him I don't put much value in those transcripts. If they thought he really tried to hire a hitman they would have charged him with that too. And considering how much corruption by the investigating bodies has been exposed I'd not be surprised if it was falsified.  Who knows what Carl Mark Force was doing? The guy was a criminal himself.

You seemed to have missed the point of my post, I think you're reading a little too deep into it. Like I said, I work in the back office for a company in financial services and it's very easy to treat everyone's issues to a number on a spreadsheet. 
All it takes is a bit of humanity and doing the right thing to run a business without fucking people over like this. But most companies care more about the bottom line and every penny than doing what's right by a paying customer.
Like I said, if this was my firm we'd make the customer whole and then figure it out on the back end. If we end up eating the loss then that's the cost of doing business the right way.
When you have 50 million customers there isn't much incentive for doing things the right way.

Second best is probably good. If you could do the online black market stuff hand to hand cash would probably make more sense. But when you're ordering online from some guy in another country cash simply doesn't work.

I think I put a about $200 into it. I built it up to around $800 (the first cashout was usually at $5000) and then it crashed.
I was in university at the time so the free money really got to my head. I saw all of these people cashing cheques in the forums and it seems like a lot of people made out well before it went down. I was aware that it was only a matter of time before it crashed and I took my chances. I was too late!

At least this systems seems limited by the amount of holdings of the person giving the loan.
It's my understanding that one of the main problems with today's fractional reserve system is that the reserve ratios are absurd since they can 'conjure' up new money just by making a few entries in the ledger, allowing them to lend more than they actually ever held.
@_date: 2015-11-26 16:00:12
I guess it could make sense in a world where cash supply is low and getting access to it would require some sort of outlay of money. But that's clearly not the case we're talking about. If anything there is going to be too much cash after all of the QE that's taken place.

I can't remember the specifics now but they basically transfered in a large sum of cash, did some very insignificant stuff with the cash, maybe even bought money market and then sold it immediately, and then sent the cash right back out.
Could have been something harmless but this is one of the scenarios the warn us about.

This is really amazing. Definitely going to buy some more BTC now.

Who would have thought that printing money wouldn't get us out of a debt crisis?
Amazing how the news of this stuff spreads though. 2-3 years ago it was all alt-news and bitcoin type sources talking about the inevitable correction. Then in the last year you started seeing some fringe mainstream blogs and news talk about it.
 
Now the head of the IMF comes right out and says what anyone paying attention has known for a few years now. I've been trying to show this to my family for 2 years now but they just say "it's how the system has always worked, so it will work out".
I don't get how people can be so short sighted.

The problem is that the illegal nature of the drug trade attracts people who are not trustworthy.
Since they are already engaging in illegal activity there is a lot less risk to doing something like stealing your money or beating you up.
This does not mean that drug users or dealers are inherently untrustworthy. Legalize it and that mostly goes away.

The sad thing about this is that I work in operations for a financial services company and this kind of thing can be resolved so easily just by someone providing decent customer service, taking responsibility and getting things done.
If this kind of thing happened to us and we couldn't determine whose fault it was we would credit the client and then take it up with the other institution.
We wouldn't hold the client hostage as if it was their mistake.
The problem with banks that are so big is that you really are reduced to a service ticket# in a queue of a thousand other identical issues. You are not human to them with a life and a family and a home payment, you are just an outage in their recon spreadsheet.

Yeah, for sure. I always try to find the best sources because you know how people can be when you don't give them a link to CNN or Wikipedia... Corbett tends to stick to really well fleshed out stuff so I like to keep his links handy.
The amazing thing is that the US involvement with ISIS is not even being denied anymore. As someone who has followed the accusations for at least 2 years it's amazing that they simply don't even deny it anymore and no one seems to be noticing. (except in our corner of the internet)
[In this video]( a senator campaigning for Clinton is asked about her support for ISIS and she doesn't even deny it! It amazes me.

Wasn't that one..
 Now it's going to bother me. I'll have to look in my old emails to find it. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:59:33
I was very, very careful to opt out of everything when installing and I still ended up with this shit on my computer.

I was told by a major exchange here in Canada not to mention bitcoin in my payment to them or it could result in this.
Meanwhile I go to an industry conference and we learn that every major bank is scrambling right now to find out a way to use blockchain/bitcoin in their favour.

I'm at that point too. If any one of those 8 things were that interesting you wouldn't be including them on a list, they'd get their own stories!
@_date: 2016-07-05 12:39:06


This is actually the one that surprised me on the list. I never even realized this. Has bitcoin ever had a crisis that took it down even for a few minutes?
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:19:46
"Wait, so the government can just *print more*?!"
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:50:23
I think they'll find a way to exploit it for their needs eventually. It will require people giving over their control just like today's system, so it will be pointless to most of us who already use bitcoin.  But most people will think it's some great new service that's saving them money.

That's part of our problem with the system in the first place. The biggest money launderers are banks and the biggest terrorist financiers are governments. Yet we have to fill in KYC and AML stuff? Fuck that. It's my cash, let me use it how I want.


That's exactly what he did. We're already moving to a cashless society though where this won't be possible without things like bitcoin.What would you have him do then? Is it really a choice at that point?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:31:52
I don't, just thought I'd mention it.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:38:54
Hehe yep, those are their extended hours.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:13:10
We also have some confirmations from people on that withdrawals are still being processed.

Alphabay accepts ethereum.

Yeah, this reminds me of when you try to make a deposit at the bank and they want proof it's your account. Funds coming in is about the least risky thing that can happen in an account.
