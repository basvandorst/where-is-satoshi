what does it mean for mt gox to be operating on fractional reserves? who would they have been lending to?

So what you're really saying is that they can skim bitcoins out and keep them for themselves as long as too many people don't try to withdraw their BTC simultaneously.
While this is similar to the concept of a bank run, it's pretty different to what a fractional reserve bank does. A bank is lending money to third parties and continuously returning the principle they take out. What you're asserting (and you will better evidence to really make this claim) is that Mt Gox is simply stealing a portion of what purports to be keeping safe. 
Soft drinks aside, I don't think you've proved anything about bitcoin itself- just one exchange.

This reasoning assumes that changing the structure of firms to be more democratic is the hallmark of progress. Not a premise on which I would hang an argument, as it really only holds for those with an egalitarian worldview.
It could (theoretically) hold for a utilitarian as well, but the author would bare the burden of proving that democratizing the workplace would improve economic growth- which he does not attempt to do.
