OK, that makes sense.  Thanks for the correction.

If you are buying and holding, and did not sell any in 2017, you probably have no tax bite for 2017.
If you tried to ride the waves, buy dips and sell at crests in 2017, those sales/purchases are reportable events.  The difference between gains and losses is the net  gain or loss you have to report.
Note, though, that losses you claim as deductable cannot exceed $3500.  So if you made short term sales with a total gain of $5K and short-term sales with a total loss of $4K, such that your overall net gain was $1000, you'll owe taxes on $1500 because your losses would exceed the maximum allowable deduction for market losses.
Overall, it works the same way day-trading and mutual funds work.  Each transactioni/shuffle/rebalance may have tax implications.
And the IRS apparently is saying that if you are trading straight between  one crypto and another, such that the asset is never actually liguid, you *still* have to report the transactions and the $USD cash values at time of trade.
Lots of people are going to need to hire CPAs this year, just to make sense of it all.

It's a scene in a movie about a guy who buys drugs.  Pretty famous movie, as I recall.  Alvin something, I think, was the actor's name.

Dude, seriously?  The Rockefellers sold all kinds of automotives to the Nazis, to raise cash to build their dinosaur army.  Truman already had his moonbase under construction by then, and Nelson Rockefeller needed money to breed Tyrannosaurs that could breathe space.
There's a great documentary about this, called *Lunopolis*.  It covers pretty much everything I just said, except the dinosaurs because that's still super secret and no one knows about it.  
You should have thought of that, though, before you ridiculed the OP.

You haven't lost unless you sell.

Fuck it.  Don't pay the dam tax.  Or wait... do you live near a river or downstream of a big lake?  If so, then definitely pay the dam tax.
If you live in the mountains, though, fuck it.  Let those people in Oroville worry about the dam.

Oh, then it's Bcash that is a slur.  That makes sense.  I get it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:14
But it did break $7K, when you bought at $7024. Even if yours was the only over-7k transaction.
The price you got was the market value at the time your purchase cleared.
At that moment, the cheapest sell order was $7024.  The market changes from moment to moment.   
To prevent this, make limit orders.

You point out a very real problem.  But the problem lies with online wallet services that refuse to give their users full access to the wallet, not with the brain trust behind BCH.
To say its a scam would be to imply that Ver can access all of those inadvertently lost coins and that he set up the system to trick people into making these mistakes.

Hmmm... someone needs to write an Ethereum smart  contract app that can escrow transactions like you suggest.
What stops you from opening a wallet account on GDAX or Bitfinex and buying at the US price, then selling it to the Indian exchange?  You're talking about a very large arbitrage -- like nearly 30%.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:40:21
Can you use a VPN?  TOR?
Thing is, without an escrow service, I doubt you'll find someone to trust you (no offense) with an asynchronous transaction.  Once someone sends you their BTC, you disappear, and.... what happens next?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:49:26
Right now, the difference between GDAX and BItfinex is around 1.5%.  I doubt you could count on being able to move fast enough to profit off of that 1%.
But $10,500 and $13300 is pretty significant.  For a US citizen, my biggest worry would be getting the net profits from Zebpay converted back into USD and back into a US-based bank.  The trigger for automated reporting by the bank to the IRS is $10,000.  That revenue stream would have to be taxable.
Any action taken to avoid reporting, or to reimport the value in something the IRS can't trace would probably be a prison-worthy criminal offense.

Oh good point.  I use gdax so forgot abt the fees on CB.    
My point was that whatever price you got on a market order, that's what the value was at that moment.  And a computerized exchange like gdax or even NASDAQ can have some surprising momentary price anomalies. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:06:36
Are you suggesting that BCH is a slur of some kind?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:18
newegg accepts them too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:01:12
I mean, I was actually kind of joking when I said there needs to be a smart contract app built in ethereum to manage these transactions.  But yeah, without a reliable escrow (and a legal way to profit that doesn't violate US tax law), there's no way I'd be in on this.

The theory is that once it becomes mainstream, BTC will never go down in value.  It's designed to be "deflationary" currency -- with regular money, today's $1 is always worth more than the same dollar next year.  Cryptocurrency (in theory) reverses that.  It might be the same value next year, but shouldn't be lower.
The precondition for this is BTC becoming an ordinary means of transacting business.  There's built-in scarcity (only 24 million BTC, ever) so as transaction volume increases, so should the value.
And of course, *in theory*, theory and practice are identical.  In practice, though, they're different.

The wallets and addressing schemes are pretty much identical.  It's saying that by default, it creates a wallet that can hold both.
