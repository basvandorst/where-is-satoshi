This was from 2014. My management suggested this logo over taking sponsorship for that spot. It was a good decision.

Open to any ideas!

Is this what you mean?

This was an idea for the r/Bitcoin subreddit specifically to have the logo of the community featured on FOX Sports 1. Seems like a lot of people who are passionate about Bitcoin here so that was more the focus, not on just finding a Bitcoin company.

Thank you!!
Found it, here I think:

I would say there are probably 3 different ways we can do this.
1) We get enough commitments and we go on the honor system. I deliver for you and once I do you all donate. 
2) We can use an escrow service if one exists for BTC?
3) I could just put link to my Coinbase and it can just be whatever we can do type of thing. I will work with my management too to ensure that there is ample value provided based on this.
If r/Bitcoin wants to be my main sponsor I would need 10 BTC. That would get your URL &amp; logo in the primary crotch spot on my shorts, the exclusive sponsor on my walkout shirt shirt and an exclusive custom walkout hat.

I didn't see where I could change the URL but I think this is what you meant? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:27:49
Thanks for the support! Want it to be something that is beneficial for everyone so that was why I opened it up to ideas! 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:48:00
Thank you for the welcome, I am all for being creative! 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:47:25
I have one set up but not sure how to set up the page?
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:06:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:14:33
Thank you for that!! Not sure what you mean by the good old raw donation addresses? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:07:28
I believe this is what you guys meant, hope so anyway! 
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:18:35
Thanks for sharing that link!

Nice to see MMA fans here on the r/Bitcoin subreddit too! Shoot me a message with what you are thinking. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:40:53
Thank you! MMA fans have always seemed to embrace technology, a lot of the sport for years seemed to live online with all the forums and websites being the major source for news. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:36:50
Thanks. Cheers to Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:18:37
Nothing to forgive! Yes I'm pro. I wore the logo on live tv and it worked out well. 
I always lurk this sub but this is my first post in years
