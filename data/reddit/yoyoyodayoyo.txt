Oh. So Kraken was right all the time!

Please stop. Bitcoin is the most centralized crypto there is.

Nobody is ever going to check at that level of detail unless they're investigating you personally, in which case you probably have other things to worry about. If you report your total realized gains when you file your taxes you're fine.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:55:01
The IRS or an equivalent entity in your country first has to get access to the exchange's data, which is not really straightforward, then has to analyze all the trades and match them with your tax filings. Suggesting that all this can be done for all traders is ridiculous.
EDIT: Take Coinbase for example. The IRS requested information on American traders that deposited a certain sum of money during certain years. And all this was possible only because Coinbase is an American company.

No, now they're fucked. Since the blockchain is public we can just follow the transactions from the address he posted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:27:40
It won't though. Channels require on chain transactions to be opened or closed. So the network will be as congested as it is now, or more if adoption somehow skyrockets. The block size is too low -- period. Even in the LN whitepaper it is said that it needs to be way higher than it is currently. Then consider that many services haven't even implemented SegWit yet, like Coinbase, which is the go-to place of all the new users. I predict it will be a disaster.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:00:18


What? How deluded are you? That's not how any of this works. It goes up only if it's used by people and adoption increases. If instead it decreases, like it's happening right now because it's unusable as a currency, the price is bound to go down. When the speculative mania finally ends, you'll see.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:20
You're delusional if you think Fiat is going away anytime soon. Stop pretending to be an economist and go study. You'll discover that inflation is a requirement for a currency. Bitcoin has so many other problems that when/if Fiat will disappear Bitcoin will be long gone.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:25:44
So you would be fine to see it at 2k?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:51:31
You can. Just sell when you think it will dip and then buy back later. More bitcoins.

Hey OP, what movie is in the GIF? Couldn't find it in the comments...
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:23
What they also don't realize is that Bitcoin will never work at global scale. It doesn't scale and it won't for the foreseeable future...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:05
To be honest the new hotness in the dark net markets world is Monero. As for the rest, I totally agree. I would add that Bitcoin stopped innovating and it's being surpassed by a lot of other projects that came after it.
Now Bitcoin is even unusable as a currency, and people are only buying *because it always goes back up* (solid reasoning there boys!).
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:58:18
Fiat changes over time, true. But with a different fiat currency. Bitcoin has way too many problems to function normally at this small scale, it will never work at a global scale. The fees are a real problem.
Satoshi gifted the world with a revolutionary invention. Bitcoin was the first implementation but now it's showing that it's behind many other coins. Sooner than later its first mover advantage will run out and it will be overtaken, that's almost a given. Right now it's in a bubble. When it pops, are you so sure that Bitcoin will be able to recover to acceptable levels? Or will it disappear into oblivion? Right now it may seem impossible because it's still the king, but in reality it's all a house of cards waiting to be wiped out.
There are other coins that could, in theory, replace fiat one day. They achieve the holy grail of the union of decentralization, fast transactions and zero fees. (No, it's not IOTA, which is buggy and centralized.) See the difference with today's Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:10:31
Yes, but one year ago Bitcoin could still catch up. Now it doesn't seem that likely, and speculation can drive the price up only so much.

Register on an exchange you can fund with your bank account (Kraken, Bitfinex, GDAX, etc.). Alternatively there are ways to buy with CC but they rip you off on the fees.

The whole chart is biased in favour of Bitcoin.
- Established history should be F. Fiat has been around for centuries, and gold even more.
- Fungible: B is a total joke. Bitcoin is the most traceable currency that exist. Another F for Bitcoin.
- Durable: B is too generous. What happens if in a couple years the Bitcoin chain disappears and everyone moves elsewhere? Your Bitcoins are worthless. Bitcoin doesn't have the track record to show any kind of durability.
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:07:12
Read again what you just wrote. We are talking about verrifiability, not fakeability. Gold should be A+ for verifiable.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:29:57
Please, use your brain. If one can inspect the history of two different units, then they are different, precisely because they have a different history. A merchant can decide to accept or refuse your payment based on the provenance of your funds. So it's clear that untraceability is one of the requirements of fungibility. For Bitcoin the history of everything is right there in the blockchain, which is completely public. There are companies that keep track of the flow of coins through the blocks and have worked alongside law enforcement and governments to track people (e.g. Chainalysis).
Read up on Monero if you want to know about the other characteristics of a fungible coin. No cryptocurrency is truly fungible, but Monero is the one that comes closest and it does a hell of a good job. If you reason about it, it's more fungible than cash itself, since the bills are numbered and can be distinguished.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:01:08
Lol this is way too much
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:12:50
I think it's definitely a combination of both.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:47:49
Not in the slightest.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:38:39
Wow, some serious misunderstanding here.
Bitcoin has no more value than tulip bulbs. There is no intrinsic value in anything that's been used as a currency over the course of history. It's just a convention that we can exchange paper sheets that have some kind of value. The same applies to gold. It's not that it has some foundamental value: it is used, currently, as a store of value. Its price depends on supply and demand, just like everything else. Why were people buying tulips? Because there were so many people that wanted them. Supply and demand.
I don't know why you bring up the fact that tulips are not particularly useful as food. What does it even matter?! Because you can eat Bitcoins right? If you think about it, Bitcoin is really a gigantic waste of energy. That's the price we pay for having a decentralized system that can guarantee correctness. Again, there is no foundamental value to Bitcoin. In a couple of years it could be that it goes extinct. Why? Because, repeat with me, there is no foundamental value to Bitcoin. If the demand goes to zero, its value follows suit. Maybe a new generation of cryptocurrencies will wipe out the current ones, who knows.
And finally, if you say that Bitcoin is fungible, you absolutely don't understand what fungible means. Because Bitcoin is not fungible, not in the slightest.
I also disagree with the other points, but I don't have time right now to respond.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:58:35
Maybe it's you the one that has problems understanding. Because with LN you are heading right into centralization and you don't even see it.
Have you tried doing some calculations? Increasing the block size is entirely sustainable. The costs of operating a LN node are not.
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:35:22
They are pretty different things, really.

Interesting. I don't think it was faked for the screenshot because Blockfolio reported something similar for a brief moment. It should use the API, so it was either a bug or a disaster.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:25:14
Yeah sure. That's why Bitmex offers up to 100x leverage!
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:25:56
Not with leverage.

Lol what the hell happened there?

You are also screwed if you lose the private key or if Bitcoin crashes for good.

Cloak is fluff. You can start by checking their rich list and end your analysis there.

You could wipe and overwrite your hard drive a hundred times and just memorize the seed. Then it's pretty much impossible for them to find it unless they put you under torture.
Encrypting it and saving it in the cloud is not as secure because they can ask you the credentials for the cloud storage, and once they find the encrypted blob they will definitely ask you to decrypt it. At that point you'll be in serious trouble.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:50:20
If it's not at least injective then it's useless, because you cannot even get back the original data. And in some cases it's impossible to find an injection between two given spaces.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:59:57
Not really. Everything went as it should and this just sets a bad precedent. When it will happen again, because it always does, what will they do? Take money out of their piggy bank again?

What about a state-sponsored 51% attack? Bitcoin would then crumble.

Why not Monero?
