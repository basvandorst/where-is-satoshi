Gold (physically) stopped being used due to the difficulty of measuring smaller and smaller amounts to use in basic day to day. Imagine trying to measure .002 Centigrams to spend at a dollar store.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gold backed currency stopped being used due to liquidity and the US trade deficit. As the economy grew, the finite amount of gold caused issues in the economy. The reason the government took the steps toward the intervention of gold was because of trade deficit would mean that we would keep exporting gold and importing fiat currency (which the government knew would inflate while the gold would deflate).  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is nothing wrong with fiat currency for use as day-to-day transactions. The fault of fiat currency is inflation but that's why you use gold and other non-inflationary investment vehicles (Bitcoin). Bitcoin has the advantage over gold because it is easy to divide a Bitcoin even to the smallest amount. I know that some Bitcoiners get bent out of shape when people speak of deflation but the Bitcoin economy is already experiencing a liquidity trap. The recent [article]( on how 78% of Bitcoins are still sitting unused shows what happens with deflation.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just because people are hoarding them does not make Bitcoins a failure imo. Though it will make it very difficult if not near impossible to make it a "currency". Why buy something in Bitcoins when I can buy with my fiat money and keep my Bitcoins which will be worth more tomorrow.

It's not doomed to fail; your analogy to gold is perfect when it comes to bitcoin. Bitcoin probably will not be a currency but instead a investment  vehicle similar to gold. Is that considered failing? Not in my opinion, especially since bitcoin was always laughed at and considered an "experiment". (Not anymore obviously)

If its anything like the shit show in tractors I don't blame them. I was reviewing some studies from the 2008-2010 days and WOW. Techs were just resetting computers/ECMs because "it made the light go away" without even know what they were doing. Though on the other end of the spectrum you had morons like International and their CRAP-force engines. Can't give away a truck with that motor. Just like all new tech it will take a while and growing pains.

Tell me about it. Try selling them -_-  
Luckily the recession means not many were made.

....Or you know it could be that freight is switching to smaller based trucks. Amazon for example is a lead employer of contractors in Non-CDL Box Trucks. LTL freight continues to rise. Tractor sales are in a glut also because of the fact non-emission controlled(2007 and older) units are basically non-existent and buyers are hesitant to jump into the new technology trucks. The history on reliability on 2008-2011 trucks is bad and most are saving cash to skip those years and jump into 2012 or newer (when the DEF tech started). Truckers are old and don't like change.

Yup the ability to pay online anonymously and direct with no charge back or other "tricks" is very useful.

I saw the article too very interesting especially for our leasing division. I'd love to know what/how/who is going to insure 80,000lbs driving down the highway autonomously. Most in the industry agree that autonomous trucks are of no threat any time soon. The driver will still be there maybe may become like auto-pilot in airplanes. Ideally you'd want the technology to increase safety to avoid accidents.

Yup you can't wait around for funds to clear because the goods can go bad.

The reason I did not pick vehicle or property because vehicles are taxes when you register them  and property is taxed based on its worth in dollars.  
What I mean is through a private transaction since BTC is still young you'll probably be conducting high value transactions in person. Yes everything you buy retail is probably going to be taxed already in some form.

Would you have to pay taxes if you purchased something with bitcoins? No  DOLLARS ever exchanged hands so nothing really to declare.

We're going down!! DIVE DIVE [DIVE](

For future reference you can also go to bitcointalk.org gain some rep and do a BTC Loan. I was in the process of working one out before the crash.

The idea is that if everyone in the queue buys just one coin then the price will easily hit 400$+ again that's just an opinion a few people have. Once MtGox verifications are over then I think we will see no action and a price stabilization or a sell off.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:16:53
IMO the Mt Gox verification queue is a good sign when we should expect things to slow down.

This is exactly why I thought it was funny. Selloff + this gave me many lulz.

If I Bought 1000 BTC for 1$ and NOW buy something (not property or vehicle) worth 50,000$ USD in BTC do I have to report taxes? Can I argue it's a barter? Can you even tax that?

You speak ill of our prophet?! DOWNVOTE! Ha take that infidel! I pass by where half of them our Krugman lovers and that is exactly how they react.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:27:45
Yea its tough with BTC because the whole no-return policy. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:26:11
It's funny because most of Reddit sucks Krugman's dick so hard and they are all about ZOMG HE IS THE PROPHET THAT WILL BRING US OUT OF THIS.

You can take out a BTC loan if you are trusted, sell and repay the loan in BTC + interest.

This is funny because I told a buddy today "man imagine a bitcoin rap" "makin it rain coinz".
