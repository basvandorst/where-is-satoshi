Hot takes right here.

I guess that is the one good thing about the sources you've provided. 
Nobody can call them "fake"

It really doesn't though.

Oh I believe that a child tested positive for meth.  I believe the facts, as they are reporting them.
I just don't believe explanation given by a 5 year old and his (former?) meth head parents.for it. Especially when this is the lone case reported.  
I believe it is far more likely that the kid got into the parents stash, and they got him to lier maybe somebody targeted the kid for something that his folks did.
It's almost like you can't even think critically about the story or something.


The "point of the OP point [you were] making" was "It happens every year around the country man some sicko puts weird shit in stuff."
This is the only thing I have been addressing in the entire conversation.  
You have provided ONE story, reported in the last few days, where the facts have not all had time to come out yet, where other, more plausible explanations exist.
Was there some other "point of the OP point" you were making that I missed?


Guess not.

Oh hey the same story, with the same sources (actually, this one cites the first one)


Sounds legit.  Being the only child in the community to get it from vampire teeth is really the only plausible explanation here.

That's not the post I replied to.
OP has stated elsewhere that he has the private keys, so who gives a shit if they throw it away?
All I was trying to do was prevent you from spreading misinformation, and maybe educate you a little in the process.
Enjoy checking all your kids' candy tonight. Be sure to check in their closets for child abductors while you're at it.

["Wow man you clearly don't have kids. It's pretty simple and easy way to minimize something bad." - \_meowmix\_5](
Pretty strange comment if you don't have kids.  English not your first language?


Sucks, man.  Sounds like a rough neighborhood.

This is a really weakly reported story to cite for a guy who claims to care about fake news.
