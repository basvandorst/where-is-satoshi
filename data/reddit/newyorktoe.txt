Thanks Darkwings_08. The report is designed so that you could stay totally anonymous while proving you are credible.
You can certainly choose to reveal more information though, by customizing your credibility report.

Agree with "getting rid of trusted third parties". 
My understanding is that Satoshi aimed to get rid of "central banks" needed to make sure there's no double-spending. They are too powerful and have commitment problems.
Our solution addresses the frustration in finding trusted BitCoin sellers/buyers online. Our role is humble: create a credibility metric from social data to facilitate BitCoin transactions. 
I believe a social trust metric might help BitCoin expand its user base and reduce friction in everyday use. Ideally, it should be as anonymous as possible. We are trying to get there.

What do you think about our solution to bring social trust to BitCoin? What are the must-have features do you want us to build in our next release?
Vote for us if you think this is a cool idea. Thank you BitCoiners!

Thanks a bunch for checking out our website, Darkwings_08. I agree with you. 
TrustingSocial will look at a user's social data to verify who she is. So with TrustingSocial, she is not anonymous. But for rest of the world, she is. 
One thing we can do in the future to improve anonymity is to commit not to store any personal data. Would it help alleviate your anonymity concern?

Agreed. Bitcoin has so many novel features beside anonymity that benefit average users: near instant transaction, zero transaction fee and truly global. My hunch is that the latest wave of Bitcoin adopters care a lot more about trust and convenience.
Technically, we can commit to "store nothing" policy. We algorithmically verify users once, then keep their basic info only.

We use proprietary fraud detection algorithms to analyze behavior and social network patterns of our users. 
We then evaluate their social networks and professional background to assign Network Quality score and Financial Credibility score.
