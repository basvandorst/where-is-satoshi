The notion of personal property is a social construct. You "own" something if society agrees that you own it. Societies are willing to agree that you own something because it's a valuable idea; societies with strong protections for personal property "rights" have higher productivity growth rates and are therefore wealthier than societies with weak protections. (Of course, this only matters when societies produce a surplus of goods, which is why it means next to fuck-all in subsistence-level societies.) 
Money itself is a claim on the future productivity of society, and any currency is just a representation of that obligation. Even if we were all to agree that you "owned" a string of characters representing a bitcoin address, you would still have the problem that we would need to agree that string of characters represents a valid claim on production. You would still need a society willing to accept your bitcoin in exchange for goods or services.
tl;dr You own what society agrees you own. That includes everything.

As near as I can tell, these guys are "backing" a crypto with another crypto. I suppose an analogy, if you don't know anything about economics, would be some shithole country claiming their currency is backed by US dollars, and therefore is worth something. Only the analogy falls apart pretty quickly if you happen to know something about economics, so maybe that's not it. 
Or maybe it is it. Maybe that really is the idea. I can't think of anything else, after reading their website. But if it is, they've got the whole thing backwards. Bitcoin does have some transactional demand, so it is worth "something", although I won't speculate as to what. These "5 day Future Forecasts" are the horseshit. It would be like the US government saying, "Don't worry about the value of the dollar, we're backing it with Venezuelan bolivars." 
So in the end, I'm just as confused as you. I must be missing something. What the fuck is this bullshit? Maybe u/EquityResearch36 can shed some light on this. He seems to imply he understands this.

Exchange rates exist because there is demand for dollar denominated goods and services in Britain, and the Eurozone, and China, etc. And vice-versa. This means, for example, that if I'm in America, and I want to buy a car built in France, I (or someone) has to come up with some Euros to pay for it. I can't pay for it in dollars, because the French automaker can't pay his workers or suppliers with dollars. Because they can't buy baguettes at the local market with dollars. So they need Euros. So I give my local car dealer dollars, and my local car dealer trades my dollars for Euros, and he sends the Euros to France, and some French guy sends me a car.
So there is a market for Euros, and there is a price in dollars for those Euros. That price is dependent on the demand for Euros from people like me who have dollars and want to buy a French car, and demand for dollars from people in France who have Euros and want to buy a copy of Die Hard 2. Foreign exchange is actually more complicated than this, but this is the key point- there is a market that determines prices (exchange rates) based on transactional demand for currencies.
With the yuan, things are a little different. The prices determined by the market are largely controlled by PBC policy. Not so much by transactional demand. This is why it is a very bad hypothetical. "The worst"? Maybe I could find a worse example. But not a worse major currency example. 
Of course, with bitcoin, things are completely different. Prices are not impacted by transactional demand, at all. So comparing bitcoin markets to FX markets is nonsense to begin with, and wondering how FX markets might affect BTC prices is silly. It's better to ask about economic events which might impact FX markets, and wonder how those events might impact the price of BTC. Maybe that's why someone (not me) downvoted your question.

If you pay for oil with bitcoin, the producers of the oil receive bitcoin. Why would they be stuck with dollars or whatever? Where do the dollars come from?

The "wealthy elite" don't own money. They own assets which return money. Those assets don't care what money is; they'll return dollars, or yen, or whatever else people use to pay for goods and services. Including bitcoin, if bitcoin ever matters. 
So how do you plan on replacing the wealthy elite, if "money" isn't the thing that makes them either wealthy or elite? Here's something for you to think about when you're daydreaming about how rich and powerful your bitcoin will make you: A retired schoolteacher getting a 40K per year pension has an asset equivalent of about a million dollars. If you buy a bitcoin and it somehow becomes (in a relatively short time) worth a million dollars, does that make you as rich and powerful as a retired schoolteacher? Is this Satoshi's Grand Plan? To make a handful of early adopting libertarians and nerds into a new class of retired schoolteachers?

If you agree that the yuan is artificially undervalued, then you understand what TopperHarley007 is saying. 
I don't know what you mean by saying "the dollar is bulletproof against a devaluation". It costs 16 cents to buy a yuan. If tomorrow it costs 20 cents to buy a yuan, that would mean I can afford fewer knickknacks and iPhones and whatever else is made in China. There are economic consequences to currency prices, which is precisely the reason China plays the game and everyone else bitches about it.
But. My dollars are as good as they ever were, except in China. They will buy me just as many apples at the local grocery store as they did yesterday. Just as many gallons of gasoline at the nearby service station. Is that what you mean by bullet proof? Because I honestly don't know what you mean by that.

Both sections C1 and C15 of the English language version state "[t]he Certificates are non-equity linked certificates which synthetically track the performance of the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum respectively less a fee component." 
I'm having a hard time finding the part where it says they actually buy BTC. The above paragraphs suggest that they aren't. Can you point me to the page in the prospectus which supports the claim that these notes are backed by bitcoin?

You underestimate people. People understand that BTC provides a hedge against fiat collapse, just as they understand a tinfoil hat is a good hedge against the possibility that the government is bombarding you with mind control rays.  Some people wear hats, and some people buy bitcoin, and most people just worry about other things at the moment. I'm sure more people would buy crypto if there were some indication that the world financial order was on the verge of collapse.

The way you establish credibility about economics is by showing you understand what mainstream economics says, and why it's mainstream. There are heterodox theories, and certainly some criticisms of mainstream ideas are valid, but if you're like most people here and watch a fucking youtube cartoon and walk away thinking you know more than any Nobel prize winner who ever lived, then you don't deserve credibility. Mainstream economics is mainstream for reasons; it's not a conspiracy. If you don't want to sound like a crackpot, you need to understand those reasons before you tell anyone else how wrong he is.

The only reason I would have bought Bolivar in 2013 would be if I needed to be in Caracas in 2013. It would have been spent in 2013. 
And the only reason I had any dollars in 2013 was to spend them in 2013. I don't give a fuck what those dollars would or wouldn't be worth now. I spent them. They aren't my problem. I didn't bury them in my backyard. Inflation only matters when it's so high it affects short term economic behavior. Which can happen. Politicians can get out of control, even more out of control than they are now in the US. But I have plenty of time, and methods to deal with it if things start looking bad here. I don't have to buy BTC or any other lottery ticket in the meantime. The odds of dollar hyperinflation right now are so low that betting on it now would be silly.  
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:34:52
It means a dollar is a ticket to participate in the US economy. It doesn't say anything about value; value is determined by a market. People can grouse about the structure of that market all they want, but, especially in the US, there is quite a bit of demand for such tickets.

I don't know why you guys are mocking him. All he's claiming is that crypto (not just BTC) will replace broad money (M3) globally in 15 years. Isn't that what you all believe will happen? That crypto is the future of money? If you don't believe the chances of that happening are very good, then what is it that you do believe?
I don't think the chances are good. I disagree with his forecast, but at least this guy is saying something. At least the words make sense when you put them together. Most of the people on this sub babble about shit like 50K BTC in a year or two because they see a reverse duck billed platypus in a price chart. They make up ridiculous theories of value. They philosophize about how "things" turn into "money". It's all nonsense. Draper is simply saying, "Crypto is the future of money, and this is how much money the world needs to run." 
If you find this forecast ridiculous, then you might want to re-evaluate your devotion to crypto.

Nah. The first question to ask your attorney is, "How many of your clients have been sent to jail for evading taxes?" If your attorney follows the shit peddled on losthorizons, the answer will likely not be zero. In fact, the owner of the site, Peter Henderson, has been to jail for following his own advice.
It's pretty easy to understand why not *every* goofball who plays this game is in jail: the IRS simply can't afford to audit everyone. But make no mistake, if you follow his advice, your chances of being audited go up, and if you do get audited, you will lose.

First, the assumption that the price of bitcoin today only depends on previous prices in nonsensical. Second, the data looks univariate, but that's only because you chose to express price as a function of time, to make a time series. In other words, you've presented the data as a function of time alone, and then turned around and claim that means it is a function of time alone. Even if we were willing to concede that the price of bitcoin only depends on time, we still have to justify the claim that any estimated parameters are constant (or at least stable) over the forecast period. This might not be an assumption necessary to derive the parameter estimates, but it is an assumption necessary to use the estimates.
Lets talk about another assumption you missed- constant variance of residuals. They aren't. That means your parameter estimates suck. We don't know what the errors in them are. You need a more general model than ARIMA to estimate the parameters.
And finally, let's get to stationarity. Auto.ARIMA just uses differencing to transform a series into a stationary series. Does that mean the transformed series IS stationary? No. It's just as close to stationary as the differencing can make it. Which can be pretty unsatisfactory. 
You cannot "auto" anything in statistical modeling. You need to verify that your data has the correct structure, and then apply a correct model. This is shit.

Statistical models make assumptions about the structure of the underlying data. Time series of bitcoin prices don't match the assumptions an ARIMA model is built on. These numbers are nonsense. They aren't more accurate than anything.

Why don't you write the IRS, and tell them how smart you are avoiding taxes with a sham loan from a trust?
If you pay back the loan, or if you even intend to pay back the loan, everything is fine. Why would a CPA tell you any different? But no, you gloat about not paying it back. Ever. That's what your problem is.

Stiglitz received the economics prize for contributions to a theory of information asymmetry in markets. Do you have a problem with that work? If not, then why should his prize be rescinded? 
I bet you don't even know what Stiglitz has done, or is saying. Instead of trying to understand what Stiglitz is saying, you see a criticism of your shower thoughts and decide he must be stupid. You're a child shouting "The Emperor has no clothes!", when in fact you cannot even see the Emperor over the heads of the grownups standing in front of you. Maybe he has no clothes, maybe he's in a suit of armor. You're too ignorant to ever know.

Why would he lose his job? Unless the terms of the loan are so generous the IRS just laughs and says it isn't a real loan, all he has to do is argue that he understood that you would pay back the loan. I'll bet he's covered there. It looks like a real loan. So he's not liable for anything. You, on the other hand, will need to convince the IRS that you are paying back the loan per the terms, or else they will decide it is simply a payment to you. And conclude the whole thing was set up to evade taxes. At which point your advisor is still not guilty of anything, since you assured him it really was a loan. He's as much a victim of your skulduggery as the IRS. Everything will fall on your head. 
But you can hope no one ever notices. Step one towards that goal would be to not crow about the scheme on places like Reddit.

I don't think I understand what you're claiming. If I sell a bitcoin on an exchange, and that transaction is not recorded on the chain (and therefore counted as output volume), what is to prevent me from subsequently spending the coin? But if it is recorded on the chain, as it must be (unless I'm completely confused), then output volume is not a measure of "economic activity".

No. Trading of financial assets in secondary markets does not count towards GDP. It is not investment, it is not consumption, it is not government spending, it is not export, and it is not import.

You're very confused.
Securities held in a custodial role by brokerages are insured by the SIPC. The FDIC doesn't have anything to do with brokerage accounts; the FDIC insures bank deposits.
TD Ameritrade is not offering to hold BTC in a custodial role. They are offering derivative contracts, which just means you have a contract between two bettors. No  bitcoin are involved. The SIPC is not involved.
What is involved is a clearing house, which serves to make sure the bets are honored. When derivatives fluctuate very rapidly, clearing houses can go bankrupt. It happens.
