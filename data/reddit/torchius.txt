First, I don't like being called a nutter. I hate nuts.


Well, technically, it is. No other currency has been able to be transferred instantly across the world in under a few seconds, and no other currency uses the blockchain or Proof-of-Work.


I was referring to a merchant or seller's point of view; it takes 3-4 days to withdraw into a bank account. So if you sell something on eBay and you need money instantly for bills, food, etc., tough luck.


Merchants are often scammed by people who use chargebacks. Saying chargebacks aren't risky is like saying that pull-type transactions are better than push-type, even though some people have their credit ruined and their bank accounts drained due to people getting access to their credit or debit card information. Yes, you can cancel the card, and yes, they get their money back, but it can take a while, which can cause problems (no money to get groceries, pay bills, etc.).
EDIT: Also, chargebacks are "possible" with Bitcoin, but unnecessary as there are better solutions. For example, multi-signature "m-of-n" transactions, where an unbiased arbiter can send a transaction if, say, the customer refuses to pay for something they received from a merchant; and if I recall correctly, there is (or used to be) a service where miners wouldn't include an unconfirmed transaction you wanted to "cancel" in the next block. However, multi-sig transactions are still superior to chargebacks.

Google may integrate Bitcoin into Google Wallet; there was a post on the front page about it.
Apple's ideas are getting sick and repetitive, IMO. They've created some cool things, but after the iPhone 19f, I don't really care about any new iPhones or iPads. If they did make their own version of Bitcoin (which would be more like credits, and since Apple is very closed-system I doubt it would either catch on or be able to be used either easily or outside of Apple products, the app store, etc.) it would be a good change in pace, albeit a short-lived one.
If they did, it wouldn't work as an altcoin. It's not planned, controlled, or launched by a central system.

I'm scared because I kinda agree with point B. If GHash doesn't use it for evil, then what's the problem? Is it because there's potential for it? There's potential for the government to buy a ton of mining rigs and obtain 51%, the price of Bitcoin isn't constantly crashing because of that, and we don't see tons of selfposts on the front page saying how people sold 50% of their 3,000,000 BTC due to the government being able to obtain 51%. IMO, it's childish that every time they go near it people panic sell. It is in the best interests of GHash that, if they do reach 51%, they don't use it. People are at GHash for profit, and causing a panic isn't very profitable.
Not that them being greedy is right, but in this case it helps me believe that they won't do a 51% attack. Greedy people do what's best for them. If you're a miner who frequently sells BTC for profit, you won't consent to doing a 51% attack with your hash power. It's also in GHash's best (greedy) interests to keep collecting fees from their miners for profit, so they also will not crash the price with a 51% attack. The cost of the hardware and the potential for profit you can get at 51% of power is pretty much always greater than the potential for profit you can get from a 51% attack.
People act greedy, which means GHash won't do a 51% attack in my opinion.

Ease of use, or lack thereof, is not a problem with Bitcoin. I doubt you understand how to use TCP/IP, but you use the Internet via browsers, correct? It's a problem that needs to be solved by developers, and once the bad guys are eliminated by GOOD regulation, we will be in the clear for new technology to simplify the process of getting and using bitcoin, so the consumer is able to use it easily.
"Crypto 2.0" will not solve anything. If it has ease of use built in it will be more restrictive. Wallets and the like should have ease of use, but the core software should be the stuff it's designed over. We need the core software to be raw and unrestricted, while we have special wallets for the people who can't manage their own money correctly.
Theft of Bitcoin isn't a problem with Bitcoin. Users do not put enough effort into protecting their computers. They are haphazard and not cautious in their browsing, clicking on fake download links that lead to password- and bitcoin-grabbing malware.
Overall, it's just plain incompetence that causes thefts with Bitcoin. And if you even try to bring up black market trades: Look at the maybe 100 daily black market trades in Bitcoin. Now look at the thousands, hundred thousands, or even millions of black market trades in USD and paper fiat. Your "Crypto 2.0" will not stop any of this, because stupidity is infinite and fixes are not.

Perhaps if they bought high and sold low. I hold onto my coins, because if I have to sell low I won't, since I'd rather end up with antique coins than dying USD. Second, if they bought low, they won't have lost much if they didn't gain anything. It seems you think everyone here are speculators that bought at 960. Lots of people here bought before the jump, and are sitting on their coins worth from $100 more to $600 more per coin, depending on when they bought.
 Even though I had the misfortune of buying around the 800-1000 range, I'm not going to sell because I believe this has potential. Maybe I'll switch my coins to another alt if it dips any lower, one like DOGE that has a strong, optimistic community, without people saying it's going to fall and Dogecoin 2.0 will replace it. It might, but then again I'm just here for the ride.

It is. If you buy 10 BTC at $10, and the price of BTC goes to $100, if you sell $10 worth of bitcoin (in that case 0.1 BTC) you have officially "broke even" and cannot lose profit with those remaining 9.9 BTC.

If you use an online wallet, then sure. If you don't have proper precautions on your side (firewall, backups, cold storage) then sure. If you have a clientside wallet or a cold/secure wallet (possibly with an online hot wallet) then it is significantly harder to steal. You should treat your private key like your credit card info; don't give it out. A paper wallet is about as secure as a wallet; if someone steals it,  then it's theirs, effectively. A cold wallet is like storing all your money in a hidden vault; practically untouchable.
What I'm trying to say is that, with the proper precautions, it is as safe as taking the same or equivalent precautions with conventional fiat currency. There is always risk, but you can take the proper precautions to lower that risk. There is no more risk, if not less risk, in using Bitcoin than using PayPal. PayPal accounts can be frozen, and keyloggers can easily retrieve passwords from infected computers.

Your first point is entirely valid, but to address 
I doubt that anyone competing with you to create a public vehicle would get any more than what you've gotten. To get anything from the Bitcoin community, proof must be provided. Whether it be a proof-of-concept or a **"hypothetical idea" posted on a throwaway**, or a simple image, flowchart, or paragraph, it will suffice as proof. You've taken the first step by verifying your credentials. This is an essential step to Bitcoin stabilizing and becoming mainstream; we just need to see if you'll go all the way and provide proof. This is a big step in the right direction for Bitcoin, but it requires courage on our part, and proof on yours.

There's 7 billion people in the world and 21 million bitcoins. A rough estimate of bitcoin per person is 0.000003 BTC, or 3 uBTC. This is less than a cent. If you want to buy something that's $10 using BTC, you'd have to have 0.01615 BTC. As the world population grows, if Bitcoin is fully adopted it would definitely become worth more as it becomes more evenly spread out.
Now if we account for distribution of wealth, people get less than 3 uBTC; some people have hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin in cold storage, which will actually help the price rise as it is spread more between people.
In other words...
This is actually good news!

Helping businesses integrate with Bitcoin for free. Services like BitPay are fine and all, but we're asking for 3% discounts for using Bitcoin to remove 3-5% credit card fees, and on top of that they have to pay BitPay 1% of each transaction. Free and open source software is something that can help the Bitcoin community grow, and I'm sure you can make plenty off of donations if you decide not to charge. =3
Wish you luck!

In my opinion, you should use both. A hot wallet with Coinbase for transactions, and Electrum for a cold wallet. You can regenerate the Electrum privkeys with a 12-word seed, which makes it good for combating corruption. Coinbase relies on dedicated infrastructure with built-in merchant and purchase support.
IMO, a paper wallet can be either a hot wallet to be used in person, or a secure cold storage wallet. You shouldn't just diversify altcoins and physical investments, you should diversify wallets and spread your coins over addresses.

However, I'd not recommend going from Coinbase (with really low prices) to Mt. Gox (High prices, but they suck and you can't get BTC or Fiat out. It's like a vacuum, or black hole.). Try another exchange other than Mt. Gox (like BTCstamp, etc.) that isn't known for shitty customer service and money never being sent.
Long story short, you can, but PLEASE spare yourself the trouble and don't sell to Mt. Gox, try a more credible exchange. Always do your homework when working with Bitcoin, or the Internet in general.

You can't hack Bitcoin. If exchanges get hacked, it's their fault for not taking the necessary steps to secure their coins. It's terrible that people lose their coins, but theft is also the user's fault. They should take proper precautions and secure their computer with malware protection, and maybe buy a hardware or paper wallet. CRYPTO 2.0 will not solve any of this. New wallets with 2FA and ease of use built in and exchanges/computers with better security will.

That sounds amazing! If you could setup a base to protect a stash of, say, a few uBTC donated by its players (a small fee to play?) then it would create a reason to practice with your friends, and find strategies that helped you defend and attack. You definitely have the right idea... =3
In fact, the best way to avoid the hot wallet emptying is to only use it for game deposits. You can have people put money in, send it to their in-game account, and have them able to spend it on games. What if you could buy something with around 10-50 satoshis? It'd be inexpensive for in-game items, and what if items persisted between games if you deposited them in your enderchest? Or maybe they'd just naturally persist if you didn't die with it, or if you do die it'll just lose durability.
There's a lot of room for potential with this.

You don't have to wait for it to be accepted into a block, or get full confirmations. Once you get a few confirmations it's safe. For low-risk things like groceries, etc. you could probably even accept zero confirmation transactions.

This is simply a flawed outlook. Holding bitcoins is very risky (volatile) due to lack of widespread adoption. In addition, speculators try to bet on volatile prices in order to make a profitable trade, creating more volatility in the bitcoin market. If a business is not going to ever get involved in Bitcoin, I think it would poorly reflect on their ability to decide whether upcoming technologies are beneficial. If you owned Bitcoin to purchase with and you found out that investors are setting up massive buy and sell walls to influence the price, you would be outraged since they would be creating volatility in an already volatile currency. If you want to think that bitcoin will not be able to be used due to its volatility, it's no different than saying you won't use it because it isn't mainstream, it will never become mainstream or stable unless more people use it and don't speculate massively.
Note that I view relatively small investments and speculation as good; it's massive buy/sell walls influencing the price that I don't like. It's balance that keeps it in check.

It's because as the difficulty goes up, the return on investment for "affordable" mining hardware goes down. This causes casual miners who got in late to stop mining, which further centralizes mining power.
If you have a bunch of old gpus or even cpus lying around, try pointing them to p2p. If someone could get me the stats on power consumption, I could see what you would need to pay to run those by solar panel, gas generator, grid power or even a hand crank generator.

I recall there was a service that let miners reverse transactions.

It's been hours. In a few days, if there's been no communication, you can start claiming it's Gox 2.0. But it'll take a few weeks to confirm that claim.

He said it's a Ponzi scheme, not a pyramid scheme. Second, Satoshi never convinced anyone to buy bitcoin. In fact, he himself said that he didn't have time to try and convince anyone. Third, yes, the Bitcoin Foundation is corrupt and horrible. But this is a DECENTRALIZED and DISTRIBUTED software. It doesn't need the Bitcoin Foundation to survive, and would be better off without it. Fourth, are you saying if anyone loses money on an investment, the investment is a pyramid scheme? That's idiotic. Fifth, what do you mean "a lack of new users eventually leads to a collapse via subsidized $15 transactions with mining." That sentence looks like it was composed by a nine year old, and has about the comprehension of one. I have been in the Bitcoin community for years, and not once have I heard about "subsidized $15 transactions with mining."
Also, if you ARE a troll, you are a very intelligent one. I wish I had any bitcoin to tip you. Congratulations for making such a well thought-out argument; made me think, and some of your points seemed valid at first (Satoshi, but then again he would have sold at $1,000, and he isn't making any money off of current transactions). Although, I guess Satoshi could be Mark Karpeles...

That's good for now, but when more layman-type people use Trezor, I can imagine pop-ups that say something like, "Computer compromised! Press this button (image of firmware update button) on your Trezor device to continue."

Mhm. Bitcoin slowly rises over long periods of time. There are bubbles. It is deflationary because it's scarce; eventually, no new coins will be produced and dead coins will go out of circulation.
Thing is, if there are people trading it to try to make a profit, the value will change, independent of whether it's deflationary or inflationary.
Not to mention if you use compare it to the price of a bitcoin on March 18, 2011 ($0.70 per bitcoin) to the price today ($244.6 per bitcoin), that's a 349.4x increase. It *is* increasing, just slowly, as you said earlier.
