32 right now. Which is probably about as much as it can run without crushing my 7mbit residential connection.
I leave it running 24/7 most of the time with an occasional reboot. The connection does have a dynamic IP, which is not ideal from what I understand, however, that's the best I can do.
Bitcoin-QT won't output the debug file?

So, how do I know that the transaction has failed permanently as opposed to just "not confirmed yet"? Is there a timeout period by which the transaction needs to be confirmed at least once or the transaction is invalid?

Stick to the notion that "bitcoin is digital cash". It behaves like cash, it has all the same advantages and drawbacks like cash, it is just digital.

Bitcoin is backed by math.

Do all transactions with no fees eventually get confirmed? If I was transferring funds between my wallets and didn't care that it will take 5+ days to confirm, can I do do that without a problem?

Doesn't that make them really easy to attack with dictionary attacks, especially if you're using common words? Are you saying that a simple "house chair" password is more secure than a decent 6 letter password? 
Won't any hacker with his salt try the common dictionary words first before trying to figure out the weird permutations?

I just realised you're based in Australia. Which is awesome as I'm in WA.
I'm definitely gonna keep you in mind when it comes to the Find 7 although tbh, I'm probably gonna go with whoever starts selling it first.

So in case if greenaddress.it it means I can't really use it as a web service unless I remember the complex seed? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of Web wallets? Why not just use a software wallet? 
I'm failing to see how this approach solves any kind of convenience challenge when it comes to utilising bitcoins and I can't shake the feeling I'm missing something crucial when it comes to understanding it.

Doesn't this assume that the attacker will just use random permutations? Wouldn't a good hacker first try the dictionary list and move to random permutations only if that fails? Doesn't the dictionary ensure that most common are tried first, lowering the security and reducing the actual crack time?

No idea if you're still monitoring this but here it goes. 
How do you handle warranty returns with such diverse international customer base?
Secondly, I'm thinking about jumping on Oppo Find 7 (2k edition). I can see you're stocking Find 5 and N1. Will you stock it and if so will it be available anywhere near the launch date if 19th of March?

Can somebody explain to me how is a mnemonic password meant to be more secure and more convenient than a plain old password? 
For example, greenaddress.it is asking me to memorise 24 random words. How is that anywhere close to convenience? 6 would be too much. 24 is outrageous.
What happens when I eventually forget the password (especially if I don't use it for a while, lets assume I don't have it written down)?
I don't think I understand the concept. :(

That's HTTPS port, it can't be blocked without breaking basically every secure website on the internet.
