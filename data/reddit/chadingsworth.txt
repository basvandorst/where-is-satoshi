This has just been FIXED. Checked with my buddy - there were some pricing intervals running in the background. New version 1.3.0 just released, when the app sleeps those processes stop, and when it restarts they restart.

I'll send these comments over to a friend of mine that is working on the project. They have a lot of improvements in the pipeline!

Price comes from exchange data and other aggregator data like coin market cap and coin cap and is then averaged out
