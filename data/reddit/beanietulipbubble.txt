You couldn't have an economy where the currency goes up in value. Nobody would spend it. And in the present it is too volatile, slow and expensive to use. Fiat wins for use as a currency.

Bitcoin is entirely unregulated, not subject to any ethical codes, and entirely scammable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:18:52
Based on?

That is an interesting point about LN - that it is still in Beta, hasn't actually proved itself in large scale, production, deployment. Also, that the people behind it may well gain from the publicity even if the product doesn't deliver.
But even if it did, what the consumer would get doesn't offer a better user experience than what they have already. Cash or card is free and instant, and banks provide services. You don't have to learn how to use cash, or have to have faith in it working.
Consumers would not want to spend a "deflationary currency" since it will be worth more tomorrow. Retailers would not want to accept a volatile currency since between selling and replenishing stock the value may drop, causing you to make a loss.
I can't see the sense in bitcoin at all.

I think you may have had too much coke yourself, matey.

So, I suppose they need to resolve the "traveling bitcoin problem" - if they come up with that route finding algorithm, it would have serious commercial applications outside bitcoin, since lots of other research has gone into it for years.
Maybe they just brute force a path?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:56:02
Yes. Daft isn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:18:33
It's been over 9000 for ages though. It's when it's under 3000 you should be worried.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:06:52
Yes, the price now *is* closer to 999 than it is to the all time high it was at about 6 weeks ago. If if continues to fall at the same rate, three figures is a few weeks away.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:54:43
Please do, could you stick in there as well so I can come and check it out?

Every transaction is a gambling transaction 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:13:43
Yes, so there are work arounds - increasing the information held at nodes (as you say, easier to find where to send when sending a payment, but more traffic all the time in general), and just having everyone on one node, which you would think would ultimately defeat the purpose of having a graph of nodes. But ultimately, no route finding algorithm.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:58:52
And that won't happen because?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:43:12
Fair enough. Photo of receipt, showing bitcoin, with today's date, and your username and you can have all my bitcoin.
Bet you can't do it, bet you can't *really* spend any bitcoin in a shop.
Edit: Knew you couldn't do it - see? It's unspendable!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:52:30
Surely you would want to get your money out while you can?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:54:40
But of course it's done
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:26:36
In what sense? How is it less probable it would go down than it was to go up?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:30:20
What can I say, my parents had amazing foresight.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:19:37
Sell. Regulation (still ongoing), a massive hack (always happening it seems) and Tether (most recent in a long line of scams) were the reasons it's been going down this time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:38:23
Well, yeah. Lack of regulation means shady scams and rampant criminality, but if you introduce regulation the only people who really need to use it (over just cash and card) won't want to. Whole thing is doomed to fail.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:55:27
Well, you wouldn't want to be selling at 800, would you?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:41:02
No, that's you putting words in my mouth.
Crypto is rife with problems, and just some of them were uniquely responsible for the events I mentioned.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:57:37
Has use? I've yet to see a shop that accepts it, or a person spend it in real life.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:32:18
It's a one time offer. If you can evidence your purchase of a whopper with bitcoin (I bet you can't buy a whopper with bitcoin), you can have *all* my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:47:54
Yep, good time to sell, it's closer to three figures than it is to the all time high of six weeks or so ago.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:55:51
Nobody, even in understands bitcoin really.
It's no good as a currency.
It's no good as a store of value.
It's slow and expensive.
It's complicated.
Nobody uses it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:56:41
I think that is the most knowledgeable answer I have seen on bitcoin. So, "the travelling bitcoin problem", you start off at a node on a graph, and you have to get to another node without knowledge of the overall topology - that hasn't been solved? What about when the topology changes, so you need to reroute? I think as you say, you'd have to know all the topology and all the changes. And since it would have to be known and updated at all nodes all the time it would be horribly inefficient. Oh dear.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:41:40
But *will* lightning network make it fast and cheap? It's not finished yet and scalability in the real world isn't proven.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:38:45
No, just that it isn't less probable the price won't keep going down than it rising 20000% (or whatever it did) in a few months.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:35:04
Yeah, but it's not legal tender and you can't spend it anywhere. If you owned bitcoin a day ago, that bitcoin is worth less today. It will be worthless one day.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:11:14
Indeed. Know when to fold 'em as a a wise man once said.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:28:19
It's only a dip if it comes back up. Sure you didn't mishear "buy the drop?"
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:58:12
Well, first nobody legitimate needs it. Second, you can't really use it even if you wanted to. Third, it's been propped up by, and manipulated with Tether. Fourth, regulation is coming. Fifth, there are numerous virtually indistinguishable competitors.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:25:30
The fact that it is no less probable that the price will continue to go down than it was to go up such a ridiculous amount in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:08:28
And on that basis, anyone who is at a profit currently would be sensible to sell up while they can. Anyone at a loss should sell up and cut their losses.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:12:25
No less probable than the meteoric inflation of the price in the last six months.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:47:17
All the bitcoin I own
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:53:09
Excellent article. Good points, well made.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:52:55
The main reason bitcoin is sliding is most likely that it doesn't do anything for the overwhelming majority of potential users. It's not delivering.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:24:45
Sell!! Sell!!! Sell!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:46:37
Yes. It can make everyone poor!
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:07:40
There's a man who knew how to hodl.

The jig is up. The game is over. Get out while you can, don't be the one holding the bag!
