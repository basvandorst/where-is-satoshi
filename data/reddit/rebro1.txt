Trezor or paper wallet
@_date: 2016-08-21 12:30:49


Well, can they bruteforce my Trezor? It wouldn't be "easily".
@_date: 2016-08-24 23:30:23
Sure it can, just look at first aid kits for cars ;)

"Option A: Lift anonymity through the mandatory registration of users"
Sure, we will all just run to IRS and register ourselves ... How the fuck can they even enforce that?

You won't make profit, even with free electricity. If you speculate the Bitcoin will rise in price to 10.000$ or more, better buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-18 23:35:14
Haha, you got owned
@_date: 2016-08-18 23:20:56
Rather buy bitcoin, even with free power, S3 is a bust
@_date: 2016-08-24 23:24:19
And how is this related to Bitcoin?

Set a goal to hodl, like few BTC and when you spend some, buy them again the next day
@_date: 2016-08-30 11:04:14
not worth of time
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:15:57
Same shit whoever wins, don't get it why do you even care, all presidents now are puppets of the corporations ... If you care, organize a revolution, the only way to change anything

few weeks to reach 4€, waste of time

Latest Antminer S9 if you have free electricity, otherwise is just a waste of money. Better to buy bitcoin.

referral spam ...
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:51:16
yeah, how much did you win in profit all together, without referrals?
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:39:10
Sure bro, free play, free lose :D
@_date: 2016-08-28 01:26:58
You can't reverse the transaction. Cry and get over it.
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:53:57
Bro, are you high right now?
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:14:40
Not going to happen
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:55:35
Ordered on 15th of July, still didn't receive, fuck them.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:45:07
better not even use faucets and go straight to work
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:26:58

@_date: 2016-11-09 11:37:03
haha, good one :)

"It's decentralized"
Not so much since ASICs, it's more and more centralized, and that's the biggest issue with Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2016-09-04 12:55:54
@_date: 2016-09-10 21:58:15
Whales do that all the time and as far as I know, it can't be prosecuted yet.
@_date: 2016-09-01 18:35:32
So they put sensors there, did they?
@_date: 2016-09-04 12:44:29
What if Bitcoin will be failure in the long run? Your kid will be called after failure, think about that for a while.
@_date: 2016-10-01 23:28:07
15%? Damn bro, that's some good business model you have there.

This was real when petrodollar was the king. Petrodollar is dead now, and so is murica.
