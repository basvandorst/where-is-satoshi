$4700 to travel 18 countries. that's a great investment.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:55:17
let them pump in, at the end, the control is not for them. the real power is on people who hold the real bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 07:51:39
nothing new about this.

Elon: dips?? Ain't nobody got time for that..
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:36:12
dont worry, human are creative, i'm sure they will come out with something.   
as for bitcoin, it might be the standard, but wont be long before it will be replace by another 'better' altcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:34:32
how could he got confused??? 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:55:35
not even $7400. too much false bull for last 8 months. until it break over 10k, everything below is normal. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:14:31
such sarcasm... i like. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:56:39
the progress is getting dull, we got excited when it first mention. but constant rejection and delays, the hope is gloomy. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:53:48
Bloomberg are still not getting anything about crypto. confused man confuse the confused public. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:02:59

@_date: 2018-09-27 06:49:31
it just another annoying 10-30 secs video like usual. normally i just skip in after 5 sec... 
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:01:14
Nothing is impossible. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:29:53
you do need staff to do manual release if your business are this big. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:28:20
i dont think its a good idea, being blockchained means everything will public. it might cause instability. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:52:53
well TA is just part of data need to determine the best trade. you need more like news, latest development to come out with the logic behind the chart. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:28:16

take me few a read to brain what he trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:31:36
take away their job is a better solution. incompetent employee is fired. incompetent organisation is doom to demise.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:33:23
what i think is at least crypto and fiat will stay side by side for another 10 to 50 years before crypto fully adapted to economy. small percentage of region will probably stay using fiat due to limited access to technology. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:34:45
make a next event for 500 pax. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:17:58
pretty much everything about current situation.
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:19:01
you been celebrating too early. it might be false bull. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:58:35
if  the market keep the current trend. slow;y but surely we will get there. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:20:57
true, you got it bro.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:25:48
why panic now? btc is dropping since Jan. its nothing new anymore. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:27:44
USD rules over all the war around the world. for terrorist, Dollar is king.
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:38:17
its mean nothing for traders nowadays. 230M can only affect a day trade. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:23:53
my condolence to my fellow miners.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:57:00
keep on print the money, until the shit hit the fan.
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:44:28
it might happen. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:21:11
mostly given up or account got banned. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:03:57
try in USD. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:30:09
in short. a backdoor to escape when shit hit the fan. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 08:01:31
probably they use BTC as a bridge to do some other deals? not necessary for hodling. traveling with 30k btc is easier than carry near 200mil around right?
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:21:49
that, unlikely to happen. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:20:35
in Amazon, no one knows about this as well.
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:35:54
not yet. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:40:30
$1000 drop, thats put alot of headache to many hodler now.
@_date: 2018-09-12 06:51:10
BTC is gonna hit lvl 60 soon. the rest of the coin are just trial player 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:14:43
only Tether... but not much... less than 0.5%
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:16:54
its a sharp drop. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:45:53
6700 aint a surge.
@_date: 2018-09-12 04:58:58
the internet are not though.
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:36:19
NO wonder since yesterday start to pop up ads regarding crypto wallet. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:14:05
even people stay anonymous with 210 btc in wallet. no big deal.
@_date: 2018-09-28 10:13:25
now is the time to buy 
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:09:42
we use to give our respect when some one pull a dollar note from wallet. now a dollar note is like toilet paper. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:57:17
the wait is agonizing. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:58:51
dont worry, i'll be back with more cash...
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:52:21
more pressure on Dell, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo will escalate the blockchain development. its a good things. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:53:03
Show me the money... then talk. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:24:25
bitcoin all the way.
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:41:22
regulation is inevitable, when more and more people start to use bitcoin, a regulation is needed to assure everyone interest is protected. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:18:51
something fishy behind all this. big whales is shorting crypto now. next they will pump the price to the moon.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:04:27
nothing is assure. but not all hope is lost. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:56:54
shouldnt be this a good news?
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:39:16
Noice. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 05:17:40
now bank just make a blockchain that make us work for them, while they just sit back and we make the money for them. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:26:59
not yet. cryptocurrency is still on infancy stage. its certainly interesting seeing government try to save it own country through cryptocurrency. escaping inflation is not through cryptocurrency but government policy and how their economy works. if the country success, either fiat or crypto will work just fine. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:24:50
now that's open up a new avenue for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:53:29
thx... i'll pass it. i got it my way..
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:10:59
why need, bitcoin can easily store whether digitally or physically. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:16:38
not everyone think the same. ranting is because they not making money on market. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:12:48
while when altcoin lose their trust, people simply abandon the altcoin and move to other altcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:31:08
better than nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:33:13
i have vote for brickstring.
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:44:01
not much different, just type of ads will change. no matter how much ads pop up wont change my opinion on product. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 07:59:56
thats alot... i have seen thousand btc deals... basically they rent out a money changer just to count the cash. the whole process is guarded by bodyguard and auxiliary polices.. imagine 30k btc deal. if done through banks, they gonna get priority bankers to do it... 
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:11:55
not much different, just type of ads will change. no matter how much ads pop up wont change my opinion on product.
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:12:59
certainly better. fiat is build to fail. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:50:49
on a small uptrend.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:05:13
more like he done alot of shit.
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:20:00
easily +100 lol.. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:42:54
nice... i shall hodl more. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:54:06
i dont think it will free up people. we just change different tools. some how whoever holding much control over bitcoin will start the samething bankers and government use to control others. the cycle restart again.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:06:19
blockchain, cryptocurrency is next. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:11:59
every couple months few thousand bitcoin is stolen from wallet or exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 06:57:01
i agree with you. just like in china, alipay and wechat pay is the most use payment method use by public. it would be great start woth crypto proxy to fiat currency. then transition from there. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:38:28
now that's smart. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:22:44
its not as cool as they say though.
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:22:30
peoples need faith, need security, when fiat fails, all turn to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:38:51
this is what we all hope for
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:09:12
well.. at least can do 10 times advantage over the latter. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:48:23
true that. but right now. greed has consume all. btc and crypto is for making money now.
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:16:32
this really could make changes. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:36:50
dude, you got it all wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:49:29
any news announce regardless big or small doesnt make a big impact to btc anymore. just the hype is over.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:04:40
never too late. you are not the 1st nor the last one. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:46:24

@_date: 2018-08-21 07:16:05

@_date: 2018-08-24 01:24:13
by whoever control the media. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:48:03
nope... its only less than 5% of the people holding it. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:13:59

@_date: 2018-08-29 15:24:42

another day another bitcoin meme.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:58:45
the real story start after 2013.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:56:24
energy consume  by bank will continue rise. btc scale on a fraction of that number. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:42:56
at least some of us are not.most of the 18 y.o. are capable to think of themselves. thing is just dont over do it. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:51:18
Of course they smell fear. BTC can take over their job.
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:49:39
men do mistake no matter what the stake. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:14:05
the frenzy is still on CD. another round when big player comes in.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:40:57
crypto doesnt ask for investor, but investor are welcome to join the party. ETF rules just make the party less fun. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:33:16
what might happen is a totally new coin is created to replace all the coin in the market.
@_date: 2018-05-02 08:10:32

aiming for this dream this year though
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:22:08
crypto is about giving freedom to the people to manage their own money instead of putting trust to the government or banks. but still it wild west out there now.
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:27:01
long before i have put my faith out of Bitcoin and related coin. other crypto are much promising in terms of utility and affordability.

@_date: 2018-08-28 09:45:00
wait until BTC to the moon. she will drop jaw.
@_date: 2018-08-29 15:28:53
why should you? bitcoin is mean give freedom to everyone to control their own money. use your extra money to buy, no need your parents consent to do so. just keep your  wallet private, everything will be fine. but keep yourself from trading if you are not confident bout it.
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:12:43
at the end, bitcoin save the day.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:44:41

i think Tesla could be the first, given Elon Musk making himself a joke on Twitter mention about bitcoin. it might be. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:12:02

when USD created debts, its like making expansion on top of their ship. leaks happen on expanded compartment, where accident happens, it can be patch sometimes, but not all the times. sometimes it might get to the point beyond salvageable. making more new compartment around the damage part is to reduce the losses or to accommodate more demands.

how bout a crypto exclusively use to trade domestically replacing existing failing currency... it should be working for country with ultra high inflation or failed state or under-developed country. Many is stuck under such circumstances. At least cryptocurrency able to open up 2 way channel from international community to improve their situation without going thru central institution. All said, major effort to make this work is need. 
Of course those who choose to live the way of their ancestor might not be able to enjoy the development brought by. But hell, its their choice.

USD is based on trustworthy. they keep on printing money to accommodate increasing demand. but the fact they printing way too much. causing inflation, high debts and high interest rate. subsequently affecting the world economy. Since many country are tether to USD, so basically all  this country are working for USD. China is using the same method to control Africa.

ever since the booming of bitcoin, 9 out of 10 people i mention about bitcoin, they immediately put me in a conclusion that bitcoin is a scam. i cant blame them due to lack of knowledge and their ignorance to conventional banking system. 
but for myself, bitcoin certainly not the right medium to replace banking system. but something out there, another cryptocurrency with better security and give back wealth autonomy and freedom to the people.

@_date: 2018-04-14 10:38:17

Japan and SK always ahead of rest of the world in terms of adopting new tech. though its good news.

The article is too basic IMHO. The title is a bit misleading for newbie... Should have done better in explaining. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:48:05
True that, the cycle will keep on going. It isn't hard to see the pattern, that is how the market works. Same like shares forex trading.

that is why bitcoin price shoot up near 20k when everyone is buying in bitcoin, scam coins emerges, fake ICO trapping those following get rich scheme. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:46:29

gold and oil is finite resource is not because they control by someone, but based on the fact that they are only limited amount of gold in our planet. its the law of physics. not market manipulation. market control only make it scarcely available to public.   
and same to bitcoin too. miner can adjust the hash rate according to market demand. eventually it will come to the day where virtually no bitcoin is unable to mine or the cost of mining is no longer profitable anymore. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:13:59
on top of btc price will be substantially higher compare now, nothing much change, economy will adjust to btc price, we hold bitcoin and other crypto on our mobile device, wallet become thinner due to less usage or no use of paper money. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:04:53

@_date: 2018-12-04 10:03:58

mostly done by under utilize hydro power dam which initially to support newly build city. due to low population, those power plant are under utilize, to sustain, they hook up with crypto mining to survive. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:30:20

@_date: 2018-12-05 12:42:34
you got the point. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:17:23
they are not sustaining obselete facilities, in fact those are relatively new. but they are under utilise due to lack of demand and low population. hence they run crypto mining to keep all this facilities operation. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:04:59
but that will defeat the purpose of banks. who ever need money will just make it their own without the funding from banks. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:00:24

@_date: 2018-12-05 12:38:06

@_date: 2018-12-04 09:16:23
i too first in for the money, then discover the tech and the rest was history. no matter how bad is the market price goes, i believe in near future, bitcoin and crypto as whole will be the mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:42:17

@_date: 2018-12-04 10:05:45

@_date: 2018-12-04 08:37:28

@_date: 2018-12-05 12:41:55

that's exactly what i do. never trust a single source of news. we are lucky in our days where we can obtain information for many sources virtually real time. even there is some difference from multiple source, there is still a cohesive piece of information. but its up to personal view to determine its worth or not.  
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:42:51
busying making money to buy the dip. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:27:55
