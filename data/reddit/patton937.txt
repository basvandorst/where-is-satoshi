I was in the same boat you were a year ago.
This is a personal decision you will need to make based on all the knowledge you have of Bitcoin.  
1. Do you think it is valuable?
2. Do you think companies are going to show interest in it?
3. Do you think it will continue to get bigger?
4. Can you afford to lose $5000 and walk away with no regrets?
If you answered yes to all 4 questions, then yes, buy and HODL.

Correct, gone forever.
Yes, the total amount of Bitcoins would drop by however many were lost forever.
It would be good for those who own Bitcoins as the value of each Bitcoin would rise.
The smaller supply of Bitcoin would make no difference, the world financial system can be run on 1 Bitcoin.

Creating a cold storage secure wallet does not require syncing Bitcoin core or using GB's of space.
Edit: Install Bitcoin core off a clean flash drive on a freshly imaged, laptop/desktop that has never touched the internet. Install it, encrypt it, make receive addresses, copy the Wallet.dat file, uninstall Bitcoin core, reimage computer.
Save Wallet.dat to multiple forms of media.
Takes less than 5 minutes not including re-imaging computer.

Also, to expand further, I wouldn't actually put 190 Bitcoins in 1 cold storage wallet, I would use 10 wallets, backed up in multiple locations.
I would rather have too many backups than not enough. When I make a cold storage wallet, I back it up on at least 4 different pieces of media, ie Dropbox, Hotmail, Flash drives and CD's.  The files are triple encrypted with 3 different passwords I have memorized and would never forget.
I am not worried the slightest about anyone hacking my wallets if they were to get a hold of them, I am more worried about losing the backups.
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:39:34
Don't trust 3rd parties with your Bitcoin as a place of "storage" and safe keeping.
Guard and protect your Bitcoin by having control over them at all times, unless of course you're spending them.
By this I mean, if you have 200 Bitcoins, don't keep them at Coinbase, Circle or an underground black market. Keep 190 of them in a safe offline wallet and only keep 10 in a personally controlled hot wallet.

I understand at the current moment the Bitcoin supply is not decreasing, however it will when the network halves again and then again, and again and again.
It seems like everyday there is another article about another company starting or announcing they are accepting Bitcoin, this seems like demand is slowly (very slowly) increasing.  
At some point, if demand slowly keeps increasing, the supply will not be able to keep up.
I thought Bitcoins are finite? They cannot be reproduced, they cannot be duplicated and there will only be 21,000,000 mined.
