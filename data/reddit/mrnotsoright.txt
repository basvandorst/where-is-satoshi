Well that was some wishful thinking...
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:59:01
Found on google search? You're trolling, right?  
If not, I'd like to see some prove...
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:30:36
Well put a price target and a remindme here and we'll see.
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:22:40
What's the other option? They are a group of bitcoin users that have seen the fees and transaction time rise dramatically and now want bitcoin to be functional again?
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:19:22
It's funny how everbody (including [me]( was saying how the price decrease was coming just a few weeks ago, and now people are somehow surprised...
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:09:56
Dash sure looks interesting. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:35:13
Lack of fungibility  
High fees  
Slow transaction / confirmations  
Lack of private send  
Centralised mining  
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:43:22
There are wallets without password? Didn't even know that's a thing...
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:25:17
RemindMe! 5 days
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:34:19
How do they get the bitcoin out of his wallet? Bruteforce password? Keylogger?
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:32:24
I think the easiest would be to sell them on some exchange like coinbase or kraken...
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:19:11
I wish Electrum wouldn’t suggest 400-500 sats/byte anymore. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:49:59
Could it be brute forced? How secure is it according  ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:31:12
They realised BCH is Bitcoin and BTC became a worthless Blockstream coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:30:17
Oh already out of arguments?
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:46:50
This guy just talked about Trezor's vulnerability:

@_date: 2018-09-11 14:19:33
I can't blame him for making this argument when 9 out of 10 times it turns out to be true...

Gold is money that is not fiat.

Go look in the other sub to find your answers. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:36:19
No. Read their stickied post and verify those facts for yourself...

Good point... * 'When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.'*
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:03:51
You can’t deposit or withdraw crypto but you can pay with crypto afaik. It will just exchange it to fiat on the fly.

@_date: 2017-02-26 12:48:13
There wasn't much inflation when currencies were still backed by gold, this really hasn't being going on for "300 or so years"...
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:37:02
The inflation rate has been well documented. I think it's not very difficult to see when things got out of hand... 
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:52:16
The cause? 1 MB blocks...
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:55:16
72 hours is the maximum before the transaction gets rejected I thought...
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:02:14
BU follows the original vision of a simple increase in block size limit over time.  
Core created a new solution to make blocks slightly bigger with a very complicated solution that does not require a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:03:25
Lol, where does one apply to get such a paid job? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:51:07
That really doesn't give us an answer...
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:12:37
It's the one thing that could save Bitcoin and people here see it as a threat... Funny and sad at the same time...
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:28:28
Ah reminds me of the good old times before the blocks were full. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:42:40
I disapprove of you disapproving this disapproval
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:08:22
Core will be the altcoin...
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:04:24
Antpool? That's a yuge one... More pools are surely gonna follow that lead. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:03:54
Because this was the original vision by Bitcoins creator to solve the scaling issue that is crippling Bitcoin now. Maybe you're new to all of this but Bitcoin used to be free and pretty fast. Now it costs you a dollar and a lot of patience to make a small payment.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:42:10
Looks like it's (getting) confirmed now?
@_date: 2017-03-02 09:52:30
What's the problem. I wished I received this msg when I first joined @_date: 2017-03-02 07:47:28
Even this accelerator is congested lately...
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:26:36
I wonder what the transaction fee will be...
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:07:18


Are you ignorant or just spreading lies? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:46:23
Scaling isn't hard...
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:38:51
Make more "using that bitcoin"? You mean like send one, receive two? Good luck with that..
@_date: 2016-06-23 19:02:52
Funny 'cause it's true! :)
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:51:27
You can run SHA-256 on your key words and use it as a private key. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:03:50
He's right though, it's the ignored fungibility issue. You might have 99,9 'clean' btc and 0,1 dirty btc that someone else used years ago in a drugs transaction. Next time you send all your btc to some exchange they refuse to pay you back because part of your bitcoins are connected to illegal activity...
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:28:56
Withdrawals **and** deposits are disabled as you can see on the screenshot...
@_date: 2018-10-18 07:32:46
He literally gave away the access keys to his account... He might just as well have posted his login &amp; password here on reddit.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:01:42
That must have been a really powerful machine at the time... Did you leave it running 24/7 or only when you were using the PC?
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:08:01
Sorry to hijack... How can you make the fee this low with Electrum?
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:09:47
People give cash gifts in red enveloppes, although money transfer through social media (mostly wechat) is getting more common. Historically people have cashed out close to chinese new year with a slight decline in bitcoin price but I don't expect anything significant...
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:55:43
Probably a “fake” electrum that stole your key. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:04:04
Get a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 07:38:22


Why is that so obvious? I thought it was just a small bitcoin startup...
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:01:53
You can dump right now, its a free market...
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:42:11
I already did... Sold when price was 0.36 BTC (not the top but not bad either :))
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:53:08
Claims it was the bitcoin kryptokit chrome extension...
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:04:15
A "chrome extension"... This can be anything... Tell us the name of the wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:50:46
Why does it cost $8?
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:18:37
Mr X would pay a higher fee on transactions. If some of Mr X bitcoin has a 'bad' history it would also be considered less valueble by some exchanges compared to bitcoins that come straight from the miner...  
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:46:09
lol would be funny if true...
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:08:30
He stated many times that bitcoin needed bigger blocks but that segwit has a higher priority...
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:55:45
I think the BTC devs made a big mistake by having the wallet generate new addresses as change address (at the moment of doing the transaction).  
I understand it makes it more anonymous but it was clearly very confusing for users who expected the remaining bitcoin to be in their send address...
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:47:09
Looks about right without a block size increase...
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:29:35
lol how many confirmations would they require? Even if it's just one you'll see very long queues...
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:55:32
Price is rising fast, expect increase in hash power....
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:05:11
Why would you implement segwit first?
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:39:34
Do you really believe this is BCH highest price?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:04:24
It confirmed already; I used that viabtc accelerator tool and it was included in the next block they mined.
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:29:47
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:45:31
Fiat and central banks: the true enemy...
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:03:04
Hurray now they can pay for transaction fees instead of food for their family /s
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:11:39
I had some BTC on Bittrex before the fork so I had some BCC already there. But you're right, depositing still not possible. (I'm sure it will be soon tho). 
@_date: 2016-12-19 08:03:57
Bitcoin is never going to help the third world with the current high fees. Why are the fees so high? Right...
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:17:51
Well said. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:53:33
Might as well ask why people need BTC with this logic...
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:40:00
Oh man I love reading stories like this. (Sorry Stone Man)
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:14:54
Fair point, you could be right about that coming crash.

Who is this Richard Heart??
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:24:53


Doesn't make sense... What country are you from? Most accounts and bank transfers in Europe are completely free...
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:45:12
What wallets ask you to manually enter a fee? :s I've used a few different ones but I've never seen this...
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:54:29
Yup, and with low transaction fees :)
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:51:55
Sounds like you kept your profits for more trading and wanted to lock away your initial investment to hodl...  
Why not use a simple paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:45:45
Payouts from a service like SatoshiDice? I'm also wondering...
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:19:44
Yeah but a lot higher than what I'm paying for my bank (nothing). 
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:14:55
Out of curiosity, what's wrong with localbtc?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:53:12
That's true. I know people who lost their BTC at Mt Gox and never got back in...
@_date: 2019-02-02 23:48:34
You know, you could just as well lost your money on a canadian exchange, just saying... Look at this for example: 
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:02:39
Because at that time there was no BCH... (by that I mean the ticker didn’t exist, it was a long time before the fork...)   
(By the way, it never became strictly a “BCH sub”, all Bitcoin discussion is welcome there and nothing is censored)
@_date: 2019-02-15 11:20:48


Been hearing this for over a year...
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:44:52
Same problem with 3.0.2?
@_date: 2019-02-02 23:42:19
Dude should put it on airbnb. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:32:45
Because gold has been valueable for thousands of years while bitcoin hasn't even been around for 10 years...
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:42:37
As a Huobi employee I want to thank you for your generous donation. We decided to use this to fund our teambuilding day where we go to stripclubs and snort coke.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:56:41
That’s the German Fidor Bank tho. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 11:22:38
And now they don't accept BTC anymore... Negative adoption :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:47:56
I tried to sign a message with a ledger and failed with both 3.0.1 &amp; 3.0.2...  
I switched back to 2.9.3
@_date: 2019-02-15 11:29:07


They didn't "take over" that sub, they went there years ago because they were being censored here...
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:14:47
Delist ofc
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:44:56
Thanks, this is interesting.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:48:31
You have to manually create a new address in Exodus? :O
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:50:53
That’s what weird to me. Most wallets like Electrum would show a new receive address but he claims his wallet supports address reuse...
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:29:11
I guess you didn’t use 2FA? I never used blockchain.info myself, but I’m guessing you only need a login and password? I think the most likely scenario is that somebody found your credentials. Do you use a rooted phone?
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:37:40
Maybe they're under attack
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:43:53
It's this subreddit that lost touch with the community (and reality)...
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:49:29
It's not about supporting him but who's supporting segwit2x... And you know, it's documented... Please educate yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:38:02
I guess he did the right thing by moving them then...
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:23:04
Are you serious? Even  ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:19:13
Now he's splitting 3 ways (wife + lawyer)... A fool indeed.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:51:46
The other sub is an echochamber as well to some extent, but you can still have a discussion there without being banned if your opinion differs...

Oh yes for sure there can be only one solution... /s
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:46:06
The ones who created bitcoin have since long left. The current core developers just made altcoins take over bitcoin's market cap by failing to scale...
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:58:27
That is a *very* long list of 2X supporters... Who else is against 2x, only bitcoin.org?

"I want to know what's going on!"
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:22:32
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:41:04
He didn't change, the ones that (since blockstream) all of a sudden started opposing any block size increase changed...
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:24:43
Yeah people seem to overlook this point. I'm more worried about dropping dead and my SO not being able to get my bitcoin than a divorce...
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:43:10
Based on the information we have, 3 seems most likely I guess...?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:08:45
I've been searching for some statistics supporting this claim, but all I could find was this chart indicating that 95% of the miners are **pro** S2X... With that much S2X hashing power, I wonder how the 1x chain can survive? :s
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:45:45
Following the fork != after the fork.
They mean longer time after the fork.

@_date: 2019-09-30 08:41:42

At first glance this list looks quite incorrect... Aren't many of those "*moved on to Bitcoin Cash*" companies still very much involved in BTC...?
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:43:40
Ok. Good to know.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:35:59

Why do you guys feel so threatened by BCH?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:27:11
It is? Why isn’t it listed on coinmarketcap?
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:13:45
because [reasons](
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:44:40
:) Here, have a small tip, paid with a **Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**  
I tipped you 0.00013033 BCH ($0.20 USD)! [How to collect](
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:45:11
what is a bcash?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:31:54
How can you be sure of that? BCH’s adoption is increasing rapidly while BTC’s is declining...
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:20:18
Good point...
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:40:06
Same problem here. Support says they're working on it... It's been more than 20 hours already.  
If you want you can expose your private keys and sweep them in another wallet...
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:52:03
I read BitPay's card has no monthly charges (but they're not available in Europe).  
Bitwala is quite expensive: monthly fees, 1 eur minimum top up fee, 3% currency exchange fee, PIN change fee, ATM withdrawal fee...  
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:13:57
So making fun of some boy with down syndrome will change any of that? It just seems like a very insecure move...
@_date: 2016-05-11 06:48:47
That must be one of the most expensive "free" credit cards you can find in Europe...
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:58:30


Time will tell...
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:56:16
It must be possible to implement this one day. Dash already has instant payments (see the vending machine example:  )
@_date: 2016-05-18 12:04:31
Just spend the amount you're comfortable with. You can just as easily buy 0.5 or 0.3185 BTC as you can buy 1 BTC.
Since you want to treat it as savings I recommend you store it on a paper wallet...
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:20:07
None of it is true...
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:58:06
Don't pay in bitcoin, pay in Dash. Instant transaction, no waiting for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:51:22
How do you feel 2 weeks later?
@_date: 2019-05-30 08:55:05
You can sign with segwit addresses in Electrum. This has been possible for a while now.
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:11:11
N26 states "5 free monthly ATM withdrawals in Germany for primary account users".  Also charges for cash deposits.  
You might be better of with
