Sure, those are reasonable things. Do you think a government not necessitated by involuntary force could accomplish that? I think people can assist people just fine. The people also have the ultimate power over corporations: their earnings. I think there are enough concerned individuals that would defend against invasion. Hell I even think there's enough desire for protection of assests, people and wealth, we could voluntarily fund a missile defense system. And I trust the free market to do it's thing more efficiently than what we have today (a lot better than the Quantitave Easer in Chief, Bernanke).

They aren't worthless, not by a longshot, still trading at ~$540/coin. It's just that recently the price peaked at $1200/coin and a lot of people have losses. This wouldn't be a problem if people had invested what they didn't care to lose, but there are many that put up to much money in a highly risky and volatile investment. It was a stupid investment decision, sure, but not worth ending  a life over. 
The other thing to know is bitcoin has had many other bubbles like this and so far everyone that has bought at the top has seen profits again, there's reason to believe that this one is no different (past performance does not predict future results though). However, people are impatient---especially newbies.

He acts like there is no value to bitcoins because there aren't properties secondary to it like gold. But the thing is ya distributed consensus system relies on something, in this case Bitcoin, to incentivize mining. I look at this as Bitcoin's usage, it's tied entirely with the revolutionary aspects of the protocol. Plus I think it's an entirely different form of money/storage/exchange that nobody has seen before and to throw it out because of arbitrary definitions is a little childish, especially coming from a nobel winner.

Well I don't have Keynesian answers for you. Personally, I like the idea of a currency that encourages discretionary spending and increases in value   over time, but your preferences may vary. Also I do not think bitcoin will be the one and only. I like competition and welcome all competing currencies to the market. Bitcoin's a great little experiment in economics and I'm excited to see the results.

@_date: 2013-12-29 20:28:06
Ok yeah I understand you. Bitcoin doesn't allow you to do any corrections to the money supply, a lot of people (myself included) are OK with that. I put faith in the market to eventually correct itself. Booms and busts are the nature of markets. Like I said though, it's still very much an experiment and if it all went to dust tomorrow, I would have only lost some of my beer money for the last few months. I do have a question for you, would you rather see a crypto currency that adjusted the money supply pegged off of other market factors (don't ask me how to implement this, just an idea)? Something that still runs implements a distributed consensus system, but where the currency to incentivise it is less static?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:41:38

@_date: 2013-12-17 15:58:28
Personally I dislike short term speculators that just come here for a quick buck. If that's your aim and you buy in on a bubble and you lose money so be it. Shake the tree and let the true believers hold. We've done it before and it'll happen again. No one here has patience during these boom amd bust cycles. Investing requires patience and if you expect insane short term gains you're gonna take a lot of risk. People did that on this last bull run and yes people lost money. Thats the risk part of it. Maybe what these panic sellers could have been doing was learning more about the protocol itself instead of participating in the masturbation. Maybe then they'd have the confidence to hold. 
I personally do downvote most of the circle jerk stuff here and try to find the meaningful discussion. But don't act like the speculators who lost a lot weren't participating in it too. This sub isn't a bunch of long term holders looking to prey on speculators, it's a mixed lot. If you're really interested in bitcoin go to much less circle jerk and actual market discussion besides earth/moon investment strategies.

The protocol describes how to enable a distributed consensus system. The currency that springs from the protocol, you're right is arbitrary. However, it must have value to incentivize mining. The currency and protocol are inherently tied.

Because it is not money (at least in any term humanity has ever seen). It's entirely different because bitcoin has to have value for the blockchain to work as an incentive for miners. That's why it has value, because of it's means of transferability. Bitcoin's store of value stems from it's use as incentive for miners and transfers. So it does have a purpose. If you don't like, don't buy into it. Simple enough. Don't spread lies that it is a weapon against banks and all you hold dear. Ideas aren't evil, people are.

I don't know a single libertarian or voluntarist that defends rape and murder. Roofying and then raping/murdering someone is an act of aggression against an individual which goes directly against non-aggression philosophies.

If you can't be responsible after taking a drug and infringe on another then you have no place taking that drug and it still violates the non-aggression principle. But there should be no law that makes you a criminal just because you ***might*** commit an aggression against others. Such is the price of liberty.

He does not have the right to kill. He may have a ***will*** to kill, but it is not a right unless in self defense.

Here's what the email says to non merchants:
Dear Dwolla Account Holder,
As you know, Dwolla does not sell, accept, mine, value, take possession of, or hold Bitcoin or any other virtual currency product, and none of Dwolla’s users transact business with Dwolla using Bitcoin or any other virtual currency product. However, recent interest involving virtual currency and its exchanges has created uncertainty and confusion around virtual currency, and Dwolla's relationship with a small number of its exchanges. This has forced Dwolla to reassign resources, funds, and services.
As Dwolla gears up for a new stage of growth, we recognize that we can no longer sustain this merchant base (.1 percent of Dwolla merchants) and its unique needs, and that attempting to do so jeopardizes both of our communities' starkly different, but similarly ambitious, vision for improving payments.
Effective October 28, 2013 at 4pm CT, Dwolla will be withdrawing its service offerings to virtual currency exchanges and virtual currency related services.
What does this mean?
    Your account, and its functionality, will remain unaffected. However, you can deactivate your account from within your Dwolla dashboard, if you so choose.
    Dwolla aims to provide its users and the few affected merchants with the guidance necessary to ensure a smooth transition. To do that, we encourage users to over-communicate with our support team, report any suspicious activity, and revisit our terms of service to ensure uninterrupted services.
What is the timeline of events?
    October 10: Only existing users with a 30-day history with Dwolla will be able to send funds to merchants affected by this change.
    October 15: Affected merchants will be limited to sending money only, and will no longer be able to receive funds from customers. They will be able to issue refunds to customers at this time.
    October 28: Affected merchants’ accounts will be suspended. No further activity will be provided.
    October 29: Provided no security or fraud concerns, Dwolla will transfer any of the remaining funds inside the affected merchant's Dwolla account to its linked bank account.
The decision to remove anyone from the network -- no matter the circumstances -- is not something Dwolla takes lightly. We are grateful for the opportunity to service and learn from these users. We wish the community and its pioneers the best.

Yeah I know. I run Linux too, I doubt the thief will even understand my os. One of those things. I backed up my keys encrypted to an sd card that was in the slot of the laptop. Thankfully it was only a little more than 5
Bitcoins, but as a student it was still a lot. Don't worry though, I'll reinvest. I started over earlier in the year I'll start over again I'll just have to be more careful. I'd rather learn a $500 lesson than a $5000 lesson.
