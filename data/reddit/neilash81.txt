Your interface looks interesting, uncomplicated and honest. I'm gonna give you a try on my brand new eCommerce site. and I wouldn't have heard of you if it wasn't for this forum so if I get on well with you I'll spread the word across my wordpress community brethren.

I'm a bit unfamiliar with the process at the moment. I've watched video's on how bitcoin works but they're too generalised. Specific examples and recommendations would be good.
I set up a shop not long ago and used a plugin to accept bitcoin payments via Chainpay as a gateway. I've not had any orders that have paid in BTC yet, and I'm a bit unfamiliar whether that's also a wallet, or if I also need a wallet to withdraw funds. I think I set up an account with Coinbase because I've got the app on my phone... but again I've been reluctant to "push the button" so to speak, and buy/ sell BTC for fear it could bite me in the ass.

Just to reply to my own post... I've since found some great video's on Youtube: 
It's done a fantastic job of spelling everything out for me. I know feel confident enough to dive right in!
