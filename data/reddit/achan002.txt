ISP will just make your internet even slower, not that vpn is already slow enough.  This is a big problem, not only does this affect the crypto market it affects everybody and small start ups that can potentially accept bitcoin as payment. This is a crutch to bitcoin it will make us pay more money to use bitcoin ,i pay enough for fees already. Also this will increase transaction time. This is bad we cannot just ignore this and bush it off.

These are not kinds of stuff u should worry about since banks can alway freeze and reverse transactions.

Also they can hand over consumer information to the feds,which takes away a big part of crypto of being Anonymous.

You just need to keep your hardware wallets updated when ever there are updates available. You need to be-able to adapt quickly with new situations and be aware of what is going on. Keep in mind how quickly technology changes. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:18:28
How did they compromise your 2fa code? To get into your account in the first place. Because it seems that your blockchain wallet got hacked some how since your paper wallet still holds coins. I dont use blockchain.info do they require a new 2fa code to send coins? And how are you getting the 2fa code an app or sms text?  It cant be a seed issue because they didn’t recover anything they actually sent your coins.  All i can think of is your blockchain.info acc got hacked by keylogging 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:59:24

Fuck dude your daughters dont need college anymore they need a lambo!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:51:08
my guess is that u got key logged when u logged in and as soon as the btc enter your wallet it got sent out.  Sorry for your loss i hope this was not a big loss for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:42:29
Will you please check your browsing history to make sure that you were on blockchain.info 100% and not accidentally on a phishing website. I would really like to know how u got stolen from

Ban of ico is good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:22:08
This price jump does not seem organic in anyway. It reminds me of when bitcoin was at 5k and dropped to 4k and went back up to 4.6k then dropped once again dont get too excited guys.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:19:52
A jump from 3000 to 3700 within mins is not organic. This is called a dead cat bounce. Expect the price to drop soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:30:00
I am down30k

 I lost a few thousand by doing this before

Can someone please tell me what is wrong with buying and selling btc because isint that what everyone is doing? Buying bitcoin and selling it when the price increase?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:29:36
If miners does not successfully signal for segwit than there will be two distinct currencies BTC/BTU and which will potentially affect the value of the coins.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:18:25
Are you saying that eventually 2 distinct bitcoins will eventually become one again if there is a split?
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:42:02
Buy that shit and hodl! I already bought 100k of btc in early may and made a shit ton from simply sitting on my ass!
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:23:11
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:14:00
bad prediction since there is no supports for your claims

@_date: 2017-05-29 00:20:30
The update is not a bad thing. It forces miners to do something they dont want to do which is activate segwitt. The reason they dont want to activate segwitt is because they wont get paid enough from transactions fees. We want segwitt miners dont! Anyways if u r still scared of the update transfer all your btc to a trezor and forget about everything and come back next year your btc will probably increase in value
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:22:04
Ok thanks haha i should have thought of these reasons before posting, silly me.
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:40:41
And it will increase the speed of peer to peer transactions
