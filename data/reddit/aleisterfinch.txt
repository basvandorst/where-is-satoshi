Well, see. I don't even know shit about investing and you just basically told me all I need to know. Unless more capital flocks to bitcoin he's fucked.
Seeing as your average person has little reason to hold bitcoins instead of dollars when bitcoin prices are falling... ouch.

Here's the thing with "only invest what you can afford to lose!"
In general, it's bullshit advice. Everyone knows it's bullshit advice. I have a much older friend who is about to turn 64. He has most of his investments in 401k. He cannot *afford* to lose those investments. At least not by most reasonable definitions of the word "afford". He could not retire (which he intends to do in the next few years) if those investments are not there.
Should he take a penalty and withdraw it as cash and put it in the bank? Should he do that with some share of that money?
Very few people would recommend such a thing. They understand that all wealth is invested. If your money is in dollar bills under your pillow, then you have invested in dollars and you have invested in a pillow. If your money is in a savings account at first national bank then you have invested in the continued existence of first national bank (and US dollars and the continued existence of the US Federal Government and FDIC).
So then it's a question of risk and volatility. You should not put money you cannot afford to lose into *very risky* investments. By giving people that advice everyone here is saying that bitcoin is *very risky*.
I agree. But one should not give the former advice without admitting the latter reasoning on which it is based.
