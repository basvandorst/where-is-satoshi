BTW, those "awesome" peaks and valleys you refer to are like .05% movement in BTC. Do you do leveraged trading on Bitmex? no I didn't think so you noob. Just keep your noob insights to yourself.

First of all, you do realize BTC has been going up for the past few days slowly. Add to that the USDT premium (which you seem to be completely unaware of) and yes you got lucky with a small profit. What makes you think btc will it's keep going up? Why don't you put your life savings in and keep doing this arbitrage if you think you can consistently make 20% off of this. If you were half a decent trader, you can make profit in crypto with trying to arb BTC. But then again, your noobiew ass wouldn't learn until you get burnt firsthand.
Can't wait to see your dumbass try this when BTC pulls a downward Bart. 
Oh btw, how about owning up to your losing bet and paying me the 1 BTC you owe me, you dishonorable scammer.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:37:28
Yeah Bitcoin crashed and Alts took off for the Moon.
@_date: 2018-10-07 12:32:59
This is like saying oh zil it 540 on binance but 543 on kucoin so I'm gonna arb it. Dumbass.
@_date: 2018-10-07 12:31:38
I know you are a clueless noob that thinks $50 is a lot and can't think in percentages, so let me make it simple by talking to you as it apply to your favorite coin $ZIL.  If you see Zil price at 540sats, but you see it it at 544 SATs on another exchange, would you think that's an arbitrage opportunity? Yeah that's how stupid you are.
@_date: 2018-10-07 10:36:59
This troll keeps posting ridiculous stuff. Do you realize $50 is .7%? Do you know ANYONE who arbs for .7% difference before fees? Do you think BTC will keep acting like a stable coin like it is doing right now? I know $50 sounds like a lot to you but seriously, stop making these retarded posts. 
Oh btw, how about owning up to your losing bet and paying up, you dishonorable scammer.

But not as fast as other cryptocurrencies, such as ETH.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:22:22
Check out LTC's chart when segwit was activated there to answer this.

Because you can't create money out of nothing. No such thing as free money.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:06:53
This is why ideas behind companies like TenX will not work at this point in time.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:23:17
"payment" oh come on try harder!

Once Bitcoin splits, they will both have partial value. Meaning Bitcoin will be worth 80% of it's old value, and BTC cash around 20% for example. However in reality, the value of both coins will be less that the value of 1 BTC before the split. No such thing as free money. Tons of people are going to lose a lot of money on 1 Aug thinking they are going to get free money.
