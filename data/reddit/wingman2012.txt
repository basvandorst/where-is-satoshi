I think the most notable beneficiaries would be the owners of a more robust feature-rich alt coin.  I'm not convinced this is even a bad thing.

Bit/Buttcoiner here.
Bitcoin is a system with value tradeoffs.  Any other assessments of it are, quite frankly, dishonest.  Specifically, BTC is very censorship resistant at the cost of it being not particularly usable and robust compared to other transaction systems.
I think people toss around the term 'FUD' because it's the only way to dismiss legitimate criticism without admitting that BTC isn't a panacea.

Another worthless and banal post from you.
The poster argues that debts as a result of money creation are not legitimate because created money cannot constitute consideration.
He links exactly the definition and standard that he's using in his statement.
I say it's a legal fail because the poster incorrectly interpreted his linked standard (which also happens to be _the_ standard) which dictates that pretty much anything (including created money) can constitute consideration.
I don't expect you to give any sort of meaningful response to this.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:26:13
No, the poster argues that debts as a result of money creation are not legitimate because created money cannot constitute consideration.
And I say it's a legal fail because pretty much anything (including created money) can constitute consideration.

@_date: 2015-07-13 14:27:19
Even through your lens of debt money=fake money, you're bargaining on the basis that this "money created from nothing" may be worth something someday.
Presumably, it's up to the market to price promises or speculations of value accordingly.  But regardless of whether that's actually the case, those promises and speculations most certainly constitute consideration.  
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:02:46
You seem to be all over the place.
Again, the premise that this money may be worth something at some point is sufficient to constitute consideration.
It is immaterial whether this money not worth face value, or even if it is in fact worth nothing.

Most software doesn't require wholesale agreement of its users to update.  Again, this is a pro and a con of bitcoin.  But don't obfuscate the issue by saying that one merely can 'write code' to update bitcoin.

That's fair.  Give me a moment.

Again, I state that the poster argues that debts as a result of money creation are not legitimate because created money cannot constitute consideration.
He links exactly the definition and standard that he's using in his statement.

Your "thesis" seems to be where you say that "you're using his failure to comply an abusive system set up to protect the wealthy, as proof that the abusive system set up to protect the wealthy is the only way that a system can be?"
Frankly, your "thesis" does not address in any way whether created money can constitute consideration.  And that's why it (and every other post you've made) is worthless.

Bit/Buttcoiner here:
The main thing to see here (or mock, if that's your thing) isn't that more TPS are needed right now or that 1 to 2 represents a material increase.  It's that the TPS civil war outlines the fact that there's no effective mechanism in bitcoin to address or solve problems.
But this 'design flaw' is also a feature, as it does make bitcoin more tamperproof and censorship resistant.

In most states, there's probably a fiduciary duty issue with holding any significant amount of BTC as an asset/investment.

This is almost exactly the system we currently have.  Third party arbiters objectively judge the advice and outcome.  We call them courts.   
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:47:26
Unfortunately, bullshitting is really really profitable.  Especially if the objectively best solution is too expensive, not profitable, or out of reach.  We see that in the pseudomedical field where people buy Acai berries, magnet bracelets, and goodness knows what else.  And that's the point.  You'll have people and "experts" swear that this stuff is just the peachiest.  Subjective standards don't play well when objective results are needed.
Honestly, I think that this should really ring home in the bitcoin space, where time and again, reputation based regulation has shown to work not at all.  I mean, why bother with objective proof of solvency when it's more profitable to have Andreas say that you're good to go?  And while that's a bit of a jab, the underlying point is the same.  Subjective standards don't generate objective answers.

Ha, seems we're entering into made-up math and economics land.  That's fine though, because ebay is a great example that needs discussing.  
I think there's one main difference between ebay and a silk road for medicine.  At least in this context.
The difference between ebay and a silk road for medicine is that ebay is not a pseudonymous market.  This means that ultimately, a transaction on ebay is protected by and can be disputed under the law.  So there's a non-theoretical incentive for ebay users to act honestly.  And for ebay itself to act honestly.  Not really the case with darknet markets, and the results have been and are predictable.

This touches on a lot of great points, so thanks for the response.
Firstly, let's talk forum selection clauses.  These are where people mutually agree on the court ahead of time.  This is a thing.  It's extremely valuable and widely used in the medical field (and every other field).  
I think what ruffles people here is the notion that they can be liable for their actions even absent an extrinsic declaration that they wish to be liable.  And there's a not very polite common sense response to this line of thought.
Secondly, let's talk arbitration.  Another very great point you brought up.  We want people to settle disputes as efficiently as possible, and arbitration is a good way to do that.  But the treatment of arbitration in the medical malpractice field is the opposite of what you're insinuating.  In many states, arbitration is actually mandatory in medical malpractice claims.  In fact, arbitration is often a condition precedent to filing a lawsuit.
Lastly, lets talk deposits.  Deposits are a great thing.  When there are real consequences (your deposit money gets taken) for acting inappropriately, people are much more likely to act appropriately.  And when there is real compensation for the victims of people acting inappropriately, people are more easily able to purchase services.  You brushed on where this becomes problematic though.  The amount.  Bad medical advice has the potential to cause permanent disability and even death.  It does and should carry tremendous liability.
Currently, we address this issue two-fold.  One, with insurance.  John Q. Doctor has an underwriter for that "deposit," which is and should be very large.  Two, we reduce the noise at the bottom by setting the bar quite high (medical school, licensing) for those that wish to give medical advice.
A pseudonymous market addresses every issue here either much worse than the current system, or not at all.

Actually, I think you're missing most of what regular normal folks want and care about.  An easy way to transfer money.  An easy way to pay.  Digital cash.
They don't care about bitcoin "making banks irrelevant" or about decentralization.  And decentralization is why the blockchain is slow, expensive and cludgy.  So it's just a bad value proposition at that point.  A huge expense/performance drain for something that almost nobody wants or cares about.

There's nothing wrong with having a review system.  
But replacing the current system?  It is absolutely 100% catastrophically worse than what we have right now through the government. (legal recourse if an objective standard of care is not met) 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:44:11
Hi, I'm an attorney.
I want to describe what I consider to be inherent problems with this.  The gist of what I'm describing is that you plan to use a subjective system (customer ratings) to evaluate a product with an objective standard (medical services).
Unfortunately, subjective and objective standards don't play well together.  A good medical outcome may not have necessarily been a pleasant or good outcome in the eyes of the patient.  And vice versa.  A bad medical outcome may have been a pleasant or good outcome in the eyes of the patient.
Because of this fundamental problem, I see a pseudonymous medical services market as fundamentally worthless.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:55:55
We have a system where third party arbiters objectively judge the advice and outcome.  We call them courts.
It's tough to patch something like this on a pseudonymous marketplace.  So dark net markets don't really have this.  That's why they kind of suck.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:10:41
That's a great example.  Or a root canal.  Or re breaking a bone to re-set it.  There's tons of unpleasant good medical outcomes. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:54:57
I think recreational drugs are a great example that really underline what I first posted.  With recreational drugs, you're using subjective criteria (a rating system) to evaluate something subjective (how much you enjoyed it).  So we're not dealing with that subjective/objective mismatch.
And as a whole, dark net markets suck.  People get ripped off, cheated, and stolen from.  However, they are infinitely better (at least in the functional category) than the non-pseudonymous legal competition that does not exist.
But non-pseudonymous legal medical services do exist.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:34:24
It's better, because now you're using objective standards (are you cured?) to evaluate objective criteria (was this good medical care).  But unfortunately, it's still a mismatch because you're using different standards.  Something like this falls short in any case where optimal care does not result in the desired outcome. 
A great example of this would be a ligament tear where the patient does not recover full strength or motion, despite going through a full regimen of treatment.
