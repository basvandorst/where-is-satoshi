It'll depend on electricity bills too. Old pc may consume a lot of power compared to raspberry pi.

That's very helpful, thank you.

Thank you. What is the scalability solution when blockchain size exceeds 256 GB? Can I add more flash drives to a raid array?

I'm very sensitive to noises, so constantly running hdd would be pretty distracting for me, considering it'll be in the same room where I work. So it's either expensive ssd or flash storage for me.

Thanks for confirming that, looks like I'll go with raspberry pi and raid array of flash drives.

That's a possibility to consider, though I'm curious about fiddling with raspberry pi just for the sake of it :), so I'm biased towards pi.

I was right lol.

Is this some sort of ViaBTC spinoff? If true, I would assume they'll be increasing their hashrate like crazy to block current signaling period and Bitmain's miners they have yet to be shipped will have some more "firmware problems". What do you think?
Update: actually nevermind, they tweeted their support for segwit.

I'm surprised this famous quote wasn't a part of the official Bitmain's rebuttal.

Probably after such a success in a litecoin short (remember his tweet that crashed litecoin?) he's moving to a bigger targets. Won't be surprised if he'll announce segwit support after bitcoin finds its bottom soon.

To be honest, I think this is how things usually go when any idea matures. First, you get a bunch of freaks with crazy ideas that no one would take seriously, and then the suits join in to shove the idea down general public's throat.
Really considering bitcoin alternatives now, but everything else seems like a 100% corporate bankcoins like Ethereum and Ripple or a worthless shitcoins. Pepecash is probably my best bet, imagine JP Morgan investing in it.
