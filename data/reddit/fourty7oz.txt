At one point a few years ago I had about 15 bitcoin and my parents also made me feel like an idiot pressuring me to sell for a few thousand dollars, well last night they told me I should have kept them. Smh it's too late now

It is a currency buddy. There are people that trade the USD, CAD, GBP, etc. You can both use a currency and trade it. It is merely an asset. Being that it is not a government backed currency, I feel as if there can be very little inflation with BTC, only basic supply and demand price changes. Makes it much easier to predict.

I have been in and out of bitcoin for 2 years (makes me most of my income) I use Coinbase as I find the ability to instantly transfer to and from my bank account convenient. Long term investments don't ever make you a lot of money; if it doesn't make you a lot of money what is the point?

Unless we are talking about when crypto currencies are in their beginning stages when it is a risk to invest. Everything else like CD's and hedge funds make you what 5% annually max.

No if you have 1 bitcoin that is worth $500 and the price drops to $250, well you still have 1 bitcoin.
