they have. the proprietor of coinbase "quit" his job at goldman sachs to start coinbase but that it their contingency plan. if at all possable destroying bitcoin outright would be preferable because it threatens their ability to print money and manipulate interest rates. if it is not possable than they will simply settle for being estraordinarily wealthy without the power to print and minipulate interest rates.

please listen to these guys. that kind of money is not safe on coinbase. go to this website.  save the website for offline use (file -&gt; save page as). restart your computer. open up the file you saved for offline use. print off wallets. then restart your computer again before you connect to the internet.
if you want to be even safer than use a usb cable to connect to your printer and delete your printer casche.

This is where the venture capital needs to be.

We are mostly libertarians. We dont like state money. Preferably we would like to use gold and silver for all purchases but the problem with gold and silver is that you cant push it through an ethernet cable. Bitcoin is important because it offers as a means of doing business over the internet with out supporting the state by doing so. 
That is why we have bitcoins. Now if you are a brick and morter store than it would just be nice of you to offer us the option of using our bitcoins there even though they are most ideally suited for the internet, because we already have some and it would always be nice to have more options of places to spend them.

Even if all of the power in the whole world went out at the same time, including all backup generators and all solar pannels and everything else like that, that still wouldnt cause anyone to lose their bitcoins.
How could the government take your bitcoins away with out coming to your house and fighting you for them?
Sorry friend you are genuinely missinformed. It would actually be easier for the government to take your gold, all they have to do is find it. Bitcoins can be stored inside of ones brain.

So i dont know if your teacher is interested in any rationality let alone rational arguments but if you want to know the obvious counter it would be something along the lines of. 
You: Is it true that a description of how to open a lemonade stand be acceptable? 
Her: Yes.
You: Is it true that the purpose of opening a lemonade stand is to make money? 
Her: Yes 
You: Is it true that the purpose of running a bitcoin miner is to make bitcoins. 
Her: Yes. 
You: Is it true that the dollars that were earned from the lemonade stand be used for all the same "bad" things that you said bitcoins could be used for? 
Her: Yes. 
You: Since all of your same arugments could also be applied equally to the lemonade stand, would you prefer to be logically consistant and also oppose a paper about how to run a lemonade stand or would you prefer to confess to your irrationality right here and right now? 
*Note* she will probably just abbuse you if you make this argument without an audience. But if you have a big audience like for example outloud infront of the class than she will be forced to either confess her mistake or risk ruining her credibility in the face of such a prima facie obviously logically consistant argument. And if she says that bitcoins are used for drug or w/e else transactions more often than USD than that is empirically demonstrably false. You can find admissions of this by government "officials" durring the US Senate hearings.
