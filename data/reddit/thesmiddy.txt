They allow both buying and selling so there'll be some fiat in them.

I buy things online using Australian dollars all the time and if the merchant is in the US then the credit card company converts it to USD at the point of sale. Exactly the same thing happens when I use bitcoin.

Solar panels have a payback period of ~3 years here in Australia so I don't know what you're talking about.
Also even if they weren't cheaper to operate than coal fired power they would still be better for the environment and therefor still the better choice.

buying property was the worst mistake of my life, at least a Lamborghini is fun for a while.

I'm Australian so it's different here. Interest was fixed for 3 year periods (the max you can usually fix for before the banks start gourging). I had to go variable towards the end (which worked in my favour anyway) as if you sell during a fixed period you have to pay break fees.
I was paying principle off, it was a 30 year mortgage, when i said pay down i meant greatly in excess of the minimum.
The way I went about it absolutely was par for the course and follows exactly the same path as people who are successful with their property investments here, i just happened to buy a lemon of a property in a very poorly managed strata.

Oh for sure, I only brang it up because it is a direct counter to the blanket idea that "buy real estate" is always a good idea.

The short version is: 
I was 22, earning $40,000 a year, apartment cost $180,000. I bought it as an investment so had tenants in it, even with their income it cost me ~$5k a year to maintain which stunted my financial growth and trapped me in jobs I hated.
After 8 years of hoping it would start to pay off I realised that day was never coming and the short term pain was not worth it. It took me over 18 months to eventually sell it for a $35,000 loss earlier this year.
Basically I sacrificed my 20's hoping to build a nestegg for my future, ended up with nothing and just wasted my 20's.

The two big ticket items were:
- Mortgage repayments: $8000-$12,000pa (fluctuated based on interest rates)
- Strata fees: $3000pa
Rental income was ~$225 a week ($11,700pa) which basically covered that but any incidentals came out of my own pocket for example:
- plumbing
- hot water system exploding (twice)
- vacant periods between tenants
- advertising fees
- agent fees
- recarpetting
- painting
- fixing cracks
- etc
If I was earning enough to pay down the mortgage then it has potential to become a positively geared investment but that just never happened for me during the life of ownership.

This trade is definitely occurring on the bitcoin network.
Scenario A: You sell bitcoins by transferring from your wallet into theirs, and they transfer USD from their account into yours.
Scenario B: You buy bitcoins by transferring USD from your account into theirs and they transfer bitcoins from their wallet into yours.
Both situations involve a transaction in the bitcoin network.
EDIT: looks like I was wrong, MtGox only add to the blockchain when you deposit or withdraw.

not if the seller needs the money now to buy their next place

That fucking sales tax shat me to tears while I was there. Go to pay for something that's listed as $9.80 with a $10 note NOPE that's actually $10.70. It's like every transaction is a bait'n'switch.

At the toll bridge and also when the advertising fairy pays him.
