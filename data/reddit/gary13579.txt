You obviously have no reason to trust me, but I vouch for them. I've known a member of the team for several years, and he's trustworthy (to me) and he's been doing a lot in the Bitcoin scene.

But then you'd have to figure out which transactions are used for Silk Road, what the recieving address is, then you need to pinpoint the recieving address to a physical person and have proof that that person is the one who is selling drugs. If they take additional steps by laundering the bitcoins before selling them, this becomes even harder. If they sell them OTC instead of using a major exchange, it becomes practically impossible.

SatoshiDice figures are public. Even before Erik started posting them, and selling stocks in the website, several people did blockchain analysis to figure these things out. Here's the spreadsheet that contains profits/transaction fees/etc

You can always invest in mining bonds. gigavps for example bought 4x 25 ghash rigs from BFL (ordered 8, took months to get first 4, he cancelled other 4 because of ASICs), then sold it at 1btc = 5mhash. When he gets the ASICs, he'll be selling much higher speeds. I've got quite a bit invested in gigamining atm, and it works out a ton better than buying hardware/paying electricity/etc.

Sorry, didn't see you were the same person. But the article suggested it was patched in 0.5.2, sad to know that it isn't, but I suppose it isn't *that* critical.

Good luck selling these Jesse. I don't have the amps to run that many atm (despite having cheap electricty), but I know a few people that do (at $0.05/kWhr). I'll ask around.

 Even if the rest of the network can compute blocks 49% of the time, the attacker can compute more than 1 blocks in that same time. The network accepts the longest chain as being valid. The attacker would have to include and build on other people's blocks for transactions to be included. If he doesn't, the rest of the blocks will be considered stale or invalid.

I've both affiliated and advertised on AnonymousAds. The idea of it is very interesting, it can be rather complicated (although docs seem to be better now).
As an affiliate, the pay seems to be shit. As an advertiser, it was more than worth it, and I quickly found several sites using AnonAds that I could target specifically to get more pageviews on, which massively increased my CTR.

I don't think he means PayPal directly but rather payment processors like them. Dwolla closing it's Bitcoin doors would be devastating for the Bitcoin community, even if other options remained open. I don't think it's very likely though, Bitcoin is probably a huge huge portion of Dwolla's income, and there are always shady payment processors that are willing to handle the risk (for an increased fee). AlertPay for example is very well known to start spiking it's fees for people who are using it for less than legitimate purposes instead of flat out closing their accounts.

Probably not. I would be running them on a VPS which doesn't allow CPU mining. Even if not for that, CPU mining pays very, very little. Plus I can run a metric fuckload of bots per CPU. qqbot wasn't written to be efficient, but amazingly it still is. Once I cleaned up the memleaks, I could push it to 700 bots and still remain under 40mb of RAM, with like 10 CPU minutes used per day.

A friend has been telling me about this for months. Can't wait to finally preorder this. The specs are pretty jaw dropping for the price. I almost broke down and bought a Nexus 7 last week -- glad I held out.

I'm not sure about detectable, but it's very doubtful you will get into any trouble for it. Everything you are transferring is encrypted and you have no access to it. Exit nodes however are available to the public internet, if someone uploads CP to some site, it may pass through your relay, but it will leave through an exit node. Whatever server is receiving the CP will see it coming from the exit node, not from you.

I'm actually quite proud of that, as I discovered it completely on my own! Was laying in bed trying to sleep and it just hit me. The only reason BNCS is used after login is to reconnect to MCP after disconnecting from the game server. If you never disconnect from the MCP server (aka, realm down blocker), you don't need BNCS, so you can close the connection and BNCS will eventually realize it's closed and clear the session. That means you can connect more bots above the standard 8 per IP. The limit then becomes how many game servers there are, as each game server only supports 4 connections per IP (and afaik, there's no way to bypass that). The technical limit is 4*num_d2gs_servers, but in practice I never went over a couple dozen bots per IP or you'd eventually end up getting 5 bots trying to be on the same server and bnet drops all of you.
Another neat aspect of this is that you can use the same cdkeys numerous times. Unfortunately, a hash containing your classic cdkey gets sent to the game server, so only one character can be in a game per classic cdkey per realm. That same restriction doesn't apply to expansion cdkeys -- you could use one xpac cdkey to cover hundreds of bots.
It turned out someone had discovered this 5-6 years before I found it, and it's pretty well known amongst higher-end d2 hackers. Just wanted to clear it up if you didn't know how it was done :).
Edit: Oh, and this exploit was great for spambots and lewt abused it heavily. Ever tried /ignore'ing a lewt spambot, and have bnet say that character/account is offline? That's why.

[I can do this too]( This is on a Tegra 2 Android tablet, overclocked to 1.5 ghz, dual core. I'm actually running cpuminer in a chroot, which contains a full Arch Linux installation that I use for programming on the device (vim, etc).

bitcoincharts sometimes includes 0x00 before the JSON for some reason, which looks to be causing raised exceptions (which you're just ignoring atm).


Also, you're telling people to use "thUSD" and "mtgoxUSD" args, but your script clearly downcases the exchange names, which means using the above values will output nothing ever.

Even if it were submitted only when sending transactions, the trojan would still be capable of reading and stealing it. The only way to prevent yourself from being hacked in this scenario is if you implemented OTP on top of bitcoin, which would take a bit of work and require you to carry a hardware device with you.

Don't see this anywhere -- what's the exchange rate? Seems like a great idea, I can always use more spare CCs (especially prepaid), but need to know exchange rate first..

Not to mention the issue that everyone would want to send transactions to the largest mining pools in attempt to get the highest reward, resulting in everyone DDoSing deepbit.

What if you're a geek? There's no way I'd type 15 pages, I'd scan it and throw it into an OCR algorithm. Not as effective as forcing me to peel a pretty shiny thing off of a pretty shiny thing -- there's no way I'd want to damage such a pretty shiny! :(

It would be very very bad if a bitcoin system relied on the network for currency transfers within the closed system. It would congest the network and require txfees for transfers for it to be resolved. 
If you use the "account" feature of bitcoind, you can instantly transfer between accounts without relying on the network. If you implement your own account system, then you can do transfers in your own database without touching the network. Both of these solutions are what most of the current closed systems such as mtgox and tradehill etc should be using.

I am inclined to agree with you. Although I don't support his actions and immaturity when dealing with the aftermath, and even if it may very well be unethical and illegal, it should be a property owners job to protect their goods.
If you purchase something in a store and recieve a $20 instead of a $5 when getting your change, is it illegal if you do not return it? They gave you money and you accepted it. It is their mistake, and they need to swallow the cost and take precautions to prevent it from happening again. Another analogy: you send a $100 bill in the mail to the wrong address, and neglect to leave a name on the letter. Should they recipient be forced to give that money back? You sent it to them afterall, and it was your mistake.
Although possession certainly does not represent ownership, I feel that when someone gives you something, whether by mistake or not, ownership is transfered (not in a legal sense, nor an ethical one, just my beliefs).

JSON.parse can only read the first part of the string, yes, which is '&lt;empty&gt;', which raises an exception (that you ignore). I changed data.strip to data.strip.tr("\x00", '') which has fixed it, but it'd be best to report this to the author of bitcoincharts.com. Telnet doesn't output the \x00 character, so that's why you don't see it.
Also, try not to wrap things like that in a blanket exception handler that doesn't output anything, it makes finding bugs like these harder. I wouldn't have found it if I wasn't comparing your scripts output to telnet and noticing that 1/2 of the transactions were missing.

Deepbit was approaching the 51% mark at one point in time. They even closed off registrations to steer miners towards other pools.
