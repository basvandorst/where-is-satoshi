Hi there,
ran into this thread when I was checking my  on Twitter and revisited 
Here's my part of the story:
- I made the 3 edits on the wikipedia page on April 5:  after I heard about the initiative on this podcast:   
- I made the edits because I thought it was a good idea to use an actual Unicode symbol for Bitcoin instead of typing BTC (and not use ฿, the Unicode symbol for the Thai currency Baht, which is, I guess, kind of disrespectful for Thai people).
- the IP address  from which the edit was made, points indeed to The Hague, Netherlands, which is where I live (public info in my Twitter bio since long:  )
- I do not consider myself a hard-core Bitcoiner or Bitcoin "expert", however I follow the subject with interest since 2011 and given some public talks on it since, see  for my earliest presentation
- I do not know the person or people behind other than that I read up on her/his/their initiative on  , and I let them know about my edit after I googled for their Twitter presence: 
- "neighbourhood" is a relative notion, but: 
-- I live in the The Hague, Netherlands, and my native language is Dutch
-- I just googled for Ecogex and they are located in Paris, France (seriously, I had assumed so far they were German because the one guy I know from the Epicenter Bitcoin podcast lives in Berlin).
That is two countries apart, two different languages.
