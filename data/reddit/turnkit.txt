Will you publish source?  Would like to port for Defcoin DFC.

But the early phase was massive grass roots involvement.
This phase seems to be cheap money from the fed being used by the rich to speculate which, if not used for transactions, will be the cause of massive bubble pop.

Half you guys posting in this thread are essentially human traffickers.

Don't the charts just show that big banker money has come in and is propping up the price?

Agree to the terms of service... which aren't listed.  Huh?

And because someone believes in something so much they spend their money on it... makes it evil -?!

LOL! 
Seriously though all you have to do is remember when it was over $1000 and you should get sobered right up.  Reality is a cold blanket sometimes.

This is the message I get when I try to just transfer my BTC out of Mt. Gox:
"Your account is currently pending review, please visit

(If you can help get funds out of Bangladesh via UAE you'll have done something really useful... and will create good momentum.)
I'd reach out to other Exchanges and see if some owners are friendly about discussing pitfalls.  It's probably a smaller community and possibly one that would really benefit it's members when they cooperate.  
Any new exchange the thrives, being first in a whole country, will strongly benefit other national exchanges tremendously.  It's what drives the price up and up and up and is really helpful in getting funds around the world, right?
So you'd think perhaps other exchanges would want to offer some good advice.

I would tend to agree if they were more upfront in their marketing.
But to have a banner ad saying "VERIFICATION REQD FOR ALL FIAT CURRENCY WITHDRAWALS" and then just change that to "VERIFICATION NEEDED FOR ALL WITHDRAWALS" right after I ask them about it is pretty crappy of them. 
They are either lazy in not updating their site, or similarly incompetent, or perhaps they are scheming for a reason, such as insolvency. Do you have possible other explanations as to why they would mislead new customers on how easy it would be to get their BTC back if they were to use their service?

Here's a link for those interested.

The point is **YOU CAN'T GET EVEN BTC OUT OF MT GOX NOW** unless you send them, and I quote,
"- VALID Photo ID (Identity card, license, passport,...)
- Residence Proof (utility bill, tax return, insurance,... no bank statements) 
ISSUED WITHIN 6 MONTHS"
What kind of crap is that? 
I suspect they are insolvent.  It's the only reasonable explanation to this sort of behavior.  
They must know that doing simple day trades and then wanting to take out BTC... and REQUIRING ID to do that will make them lose customers, right?
So why would they do it?
Simple -- to slow down withdrawals, and in some cases lock accounts so they can just hold people's coin.
AVOID MT GOX AT ALL COSTS
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:57:50
Yes, you now cannot get Mt. Gox BTC out without sending them copies of everything someone might need to steal your ID: photo ID, utility bills, etc.
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:02:28
You are probably right.
It was an emotional reaction.
I still don't trust the company at all.
When I put the BTC in they clearly stated VERIFICATION NEEDED FOR FIAT CURRENCY WITHDRAWALS. Two days later I try to get my BTC back and after pointing this out they just changed their web site so it says VERIFICATION NEEDED FOR ALL WITHDRAWALS.  Scummy thieves.  They have no right to know who I am to just give my BTC back.  I even tried to just donate it from their site to the Bitcoin Foundation -- an option on their site. Won't go. I have to send all my private infos first.  I call that extortion. I wasn't part of the agreement going in.
So yes, I am reacting emotionally b/c I am pissed that I trusted Mt. Gox and I feel they screwed me. And yes, you are probably right it might not be that they are insolvent.  But seriously... why would anybody do business with them?

Since I started emailing them about 12 hours ago they changed the header warning.
It used to say:
"Attention Users: From May 30th 2013 all withdrawals and deposits in fiat currency will require account verification."
But in the last 12 hours has changed to:
"Attention Users: All withdrawals and deposits require account  verification."
This was right after I questioned why they would imply non-fiat exchanges would not have a message that ID was required.
MT GOX = SCAMMERS.
p.s. I found an older message back in April where the header message said,
"Attention Users: From May 30th 2013 all withdrawals and deposits in fiat currency will require account verification. However withdrawals and deposits in Bitcoin (BTC) do not require verification."
So clearly they have been changing this.  Too bad they didn't make it clear before I sent them BTC.

One feature that can be improved upon on Mt Gox is how the funding amounts are entered.  At times what you really want to do is say "sell all I have when the price reaches xxx" (or "buy...") but that entry mechanism is a bit clunky to do that.
