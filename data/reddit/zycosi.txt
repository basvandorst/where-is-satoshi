The big mac index assumes that the cost of a big mac would be the same in all countries if it wasn't for currencies being overvalued or undervalued but  labor availability, cost of transportation, cost of energy and capital availability are at least as important as currency valuation.
The problem with nominal inflation, is that you shouldn't have to invest  to simply not lose money. From a macroeconomic perspective it causes overconsumption and from a person perspective, I'm putting my savings on the line when I give it to somebody to invest so I'd rather not if I didn't have to.

It kind of is, but in the same way insurance companies have insurance in case of an unusually high number of claims, mining pools could do something similar with insurance.
ATM the irregularity that there is in pools incentives bigger pools, an insurance company would provide the benefit of reliable income without causing issues about double spending.

Takes effort on their part and they don't see any benefit.

Sounds like there should be a bitcoin mining insurance company, you give them a % of what you mine and in return if you have a dry spell they send some btc your way.

This is equally true for fiat currencies and they have relatively stable prices.


Currencies may not be investment vehicles but being a store of wealth is an important characteristic of money so the fact that they inflate is definitely a flaw. Building off that, the fact that inflation is built into modern monetary systems doesn't in any sense justify the inflation.

Disclaimer: I don't think that bitcoin is in a bubble right now, but think that its a thought worth entertaining.
That regression analysis assumes that the whole thing isn't a part of a larger bubble, if that were the case, then this analysis is the equivalent to analyzing the growth from mar-apr and speculating from that, when the "real value" could be much lower.
Again, I don't think this is the case, and that the spreading acceptance in China represents a lot of new utility, but if you are somebody with a lot invested in bitcoins, then it might be wise to be cautious.
triple disclaimer: I am very much just some guy, I don't have any huge amount of experience that I'm drawing this from.
