That's interesting. So it's possible to pay a transaction to a public key, instead of an address? How would one go about doing that? (Genuine question, not sarcasm. In case it needs saying.)

Blockchain is different, in that they don't control the private key. That should be the  rule: Make sure only you control the private key.

I'm thinking they had lots of BTC in cold wallets. Then every time the hot system said "running low on bitcoins", someone topped it up from a cold wallet. And nobody every tallied it all up.

I don't think we are supposed to care. It just got up voted because he told people not to do so. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:43:33
A simple rule for the future: never keep valuable amounts of Bitcoin in a wallet where anyone except you knows the private keys. That includes coinbase.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that you are in control. As soon as you hand over the keys to someone else (even someone you consider trustworthy), you give up all control. You are no better off than holding fiat in a bank. Except if this "bank" goes belly up, there is no government regulator to bail you out.
Be your own bank.

It's still a valid reason not to use gox. Just because it also applies to other exchanges doesn't make it wrong.
"Why shouldn't I eat cyanide?"
"Because cyanide is poisonous, and will kill you."

I don't think it's even possible for it to happen. It's simply impossible to create a transaction that 'disappears' coins. They can become inaccessible, but can't just vanish.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:03:41
Think of it this way. Some day we will need something like ~5% of market cap being spent as fees anyway, to keep the miners happy. By inflating rather than requiring fees, Dogecoin will reward spending and foster a healthy currency ecosystem. Bitcoin's rising fees will punish spending and encourage further hoarding.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:44:13
I hear ya.
To rant at a tangent... To me the point of bitcoin is that only you are responsible. You hold the private keys. I never understood why anyone would maintain a significant balance on a 3rd party service where the 3rd party held the private key. That's no difference to holding cash in a bank, except with cryptos there are no regulations to protect you when that 3rd party goes belly up.
The correct way to do bitcoin is to keep your own coins. Encrypted hot wallet, cold storage, whatever. Be your own bank.
This is why I don't think btc can ever become mass market. Most people are not competent to hold their own BTC and must rely on a 3rd party. And then what's the point.

To steal bitcoin either find the private key and transfer them to yourself, or trick the owner into sending them to you.

A digression: In British English, companies are commonly referred to in the plural, so "Blockchain want to reward you" would be correct to a Brit.
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:55:34
I don't follow how you get to the part about threats of violence being the cause of demand for fiat currency. Where and when, by and to whom, are these threats made? Or are they hypothetical threats that you think might be made, in a certain circumstance, in the future? I don't get it.
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:46:24
You gave it away for someone else to look after for you. That was your mistake.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:13:52
You are an idiot.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:26:39
So you track down every person who ever bought BTC at an exchange, which had a stolen source somewhere in the history, and ask them to hand it back?
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:27:30
So you track down every person who ever bought BTC at an exchange, which had a stolen source somewhere in the history, and ask them to hand it back? What if ownership changed another 100 times already?

How do you deal with the fact that your own coins are now tainted?
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:09:19
I see a flaw with your scheme. There is no way to refuse to accept a bitcoin transaction. That is, transactions are only authenticated by the sender; the owner of the receiving address has no say in the matter.
If someone sent a quantity of bitcoin to one of your addresses from a blacklisted address, without your consent, your address must now also be blacklisted since it contains funds from a blacklisted address.
This forms the basis of an attack whereby a malicious actor can "poison" anyone's address by sending them stolen coins.
How do you propose to deal with that problem?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:52:12

Perhaps they had an automatic system to re-send the "failed" transactions (which would money on support costs...)
Also this loss has taken place over a number of *years*. And they never noticed. It's incredible.

If only there were a way to securely hold our own bitcoins. Then we wouldn't need to depend on these damn middlemen. What we need, is some kind of decentralised peer to peer cryptographic  currency.

Mildly questionable. Right.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:47:50
Thank you! That was very interesting. I would have assumed that taking &lt;50BTC reward would be an invalid block, but clearly not.
So this means that if you sum the balance of every address (including unspendable ones), the total will be a whole number of BTC minus 1 satoshi?

@_date: 2015-01-21 07:13:54
In the UK you definitely can ring a person. It's idiomatic in the language, "to ring someone" (or "to ring someone up") means to make a phone call to them. We also "phone" people. Rarely would a Brit use "call" in this context, that's definitely a US English thing.
