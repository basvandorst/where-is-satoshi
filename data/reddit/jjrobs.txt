Back again

I did that and it shows a zero balance
Do you have to wait for it to sync? There is a green light in bottom right.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:28:00
Yep they are properly synced and up to date. 
Also I don't understand how a previously confirmed transaction with thousands of confirmations can suddenly become unconfirmed.
I don't know how to fix this

The only bitcoin I have left in multibit is this btc that is trapped there as unconfirmed.
I am trying to get it out with no luck or apparent way to do so which is why I need help

The wallet was exodus. It claims to have syncd and says it takes 5 to 10 mins.
I hit refresh to get it to sync again and it still shows a zero balance
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:23:06
Why do I need that?
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:08:17
There was no change of address or wallet. One day I just logged onto multibit and a small percentage of bitcoin that I had in the wallet had changed from confirmed to unconfirmed.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:18:29
It's not impossible. It happened in multibit before and repair wallet fixed it but I have tried repair wallet more than 20 times with no luck on this occasion.

Ok so I am now trying electrum wallet and have used the 12 seed words to do a restore.
Wallet is sync'ing and has been for about 24 hours now. I know that electrum does not download the whole blockchain but I have 2 questions
1) How long should it take to sync normally
2) There does not seem to be any progress meter. How can I tell how far through the sync process it is?

@_date: 2018-02-27 19:03:07
What address?
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:19:13
It's not. I tried using a different wallet and restoring using my keywords which worked but the new wallet just showed a zero balance.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:55:13
12 words
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:41:43
How? Exodus did not work.

Hi a few months ago 2 transactions in my multibit wallet changed from confirmed to unconfirmed.
The last time I had unconfirmed transaction problems with multibit I did a repair wallet and it fixed it.
This time I have done repair wallet 10 times and have waited a few months to see if the problem fixed itself. It didn't.
The 2 transactions are from 2015 and were confirmed in 2015 on the day I made them
On blockchain.info they both show that they currently have more than 95.000 confirmations so I don't understand why wallets won't recognize this
I tried 2 other pieces of wallet software and recovered the account with wallet words and the recovery worked but the coins still didn't show up as confirmed.
