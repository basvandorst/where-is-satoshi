I think most people know that there is a markup of about 1.50 over the market price when you buy with CB. All you have to do is look when you buy. Plus their outrageous fees.

Tell her nothing. Money easily changes people and relationships, and even the happiest marriage can one day end in divorce. If that happens there is a good chance she will get half your stack. You made the wise decision to buy BTC while it was still cheap, so you and you alone deserve to keep it in the event things go south. If she hates her job encourage her to find find a new one. If you want to share the wealth with her, cash out some of your stack from time to time and find creative ways to "launder" it back to yourself in the form of fiat (e.g., "hey honey, guess who won $1000 in the lottery!", bonuses at work, slip $100, $200 into your cash stash at home from time to time, etc.). But keep your mouth shut about the 1.8 mil.. The less people know about you, the better off you are; this applies to family, friends, and strangers. Take care my friend, and congrats on your wealth!
Edit: talk to a tax/business attorney if you plan to sell all or a significant amount for fiat.

I see a lot of guys posting with the very naive view, "This is your wife bra, your WIFE!!! If you don't trust her, divorce her. If you stay with her, tell her EVERYTHING!!!" First, the issue is not simply about trust, maybe his wife is not good with money and the OP is afraid she'll spend it all on stupid shit. You can love and trust someone but still doubt their wisdom when it comes to money. Second, they have a child together, many people will stay together for their kids even though they have HUGE issues. Third, grow up. EVERYONE keeps big secrets, no matter how close they are. You think wives tell their husbands everything lol. Fourth, none of us have any idea what life has in store for us. If your marriage ends up in the dustbin one day years down the line, you will regret taking an honesty is the best policy approach.
