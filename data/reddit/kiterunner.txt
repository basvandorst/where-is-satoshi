Out of curiosity, why is it a bad idea to pay with Coinbase account? Still a noob, sorry :)

My first ever tip on reddit, thank you!

That was just 19 days ago?!? Feels like an eternity. Also, I have stopped looking at the day-to-day ups and downs owing to the fact that, there are no good place left to buy/sell bitcoins anymore where I live (India ie.). That might have helped too. Seems like I will have to hold on to my 3/4 bitcoins to the end of times. No regrets though, I'm a believer :)

I already use Linux in all my computers :)

Humble Indie Bundle bro, check out the recent one:

Thank you for the info. You guys are a bunch of such nice peeps (in my experience), I wonder why many call this sub-reddit hostile to newbies?
EDIT: Those unconfirmed transactions are now gone! As you said, just some "temporary inconvenience", that is all :)

Came here to say exactly this. iOS is a very restrictive platform ("corrupt" may not be the right word for it). Hell, you can't even change the defaults for many stock apps such as the Safari browser. How can anyone be "okay" with that sort of restrictions is beyond me.

Yeah, that I understand. Thanks for clarification. I only keep small amounts in Coinbase account. It is easier for transaction though, because you can't carry around your computer everywhere. Are their any multibit equivalent for mobile phones?

FYI Namecheap already accept payments in Bitcoin (and without PayPal).

WOW! You've just got a new customer, Namecheap!

Whaat? I don't know about their store per se, but I have bought Humble Indie Bundle packages several times using Bitcoin. Is this a new development? Am I missing something obvious here?
