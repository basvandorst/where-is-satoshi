I'm using mycelium that supposedly is up to date. It gives you the option to be ultra cheap, cheap, moderately cheap, and relatively cheap and I choose the highest two most every transaction. 
Idk...this is wacky either way. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:33:48
Are the two bigger ones. I have one for .015btc  that's similar
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:50:19
Dude.  Gtf outta here with that shit.
I'm not posting screenshots unless it comes to that.  Click on the support.coinbase links below(*edit...above, wherever.. here  ) and read what they posted on their own site. 
I'm not omitting any information, either.  Coinbase is free to out me if I'm lying about a single fucking thing. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:03:11
I'm embarrassed to say how much premium I paid just to have the privilege of "instant" withdrawal .
Let's just say it's slightly lower than a pawn shop's premium. 
Fucking disgusting rate for money changing.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:54:25
Nope.  I got a wife, kid, and in-laws in town.  
I'll be on the phone at 11am cst. and in this thread tomorrow though.

How about you pay me what I'm owed before you go giving out $10 to new people. 
Eerily close to the definition of a ponzi scheme. 
"Pon·zi scheme
ˈpänzē ˌskēm/
a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors."  
Ok...so it's a modified ponzi scheme.  Call it a reverse funnel system,  if you will. 
Pay me my money Coinbase. You know who I am at this point. 
I've done everything you've asked and then some, and it's been ALMOST TEN DAYS SINCE MY BTC AND/OR MONEY HAS DISAPPEARED. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:30:51
I will say... I have never had an issue with buying btc from CB, whether it be via linked debit or CC. It's only during a sell that all this shit started. But suffice to say I'm out for good after all this hopefully gets settled. Kraken was fucking brilliant signing up with.  Account made and manually verified all my documents within 10 minutes of submitting them.
As far as I can tell on kraken the only way to sell btc in usd is via bank wire,  but that's just upon a cursory glance. 
As with most things in life,  convenience comes at a significant cost.

CAUTION with Coinbase&gt;PayPal.
I initiated a sell Monday morning and the usually instant transaction is now locked up in the ether...going on 6 days and counting with no btc in my account or money in PayPal.
Customer support is TERRIBLE. and might as well be non existent. 
CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:40:18
I used Coinbase's "instant withdrawal to PayPal" feature 10 days ago paying an ungodly premium for the service and here we are 10 days later with a whole lot of FUCK ALL.
NO BTC. NO PAYPAL USD. A BUNCH OF LIP SERVICE FROM CB email reps. NO ACTION. NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT CHAT OR HOTLINE.
Beware. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 20:05:28
Just wait. 
If you keep using it you'll give them more credit than they deserve and you'll get your btc and or money locked up with NONEXISTANT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. 
6 days I've been waiting for them to fix THEIR OWN PLATFORMS PROBLEM.   The SOOOOOOOOUUND of SIIIIILENCE.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:28:20
OH SHIT....thats rich.

Of course I haven't heard back.  
Support+reddit  email sent. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:56:16
Thanks Dave.
     I don't know if my support tickets had to get escalated to you before something happened but within 24 hrs of talking to you via email at least SOMETHING happened.  Albeit not what I was expecting and the usd conversion worked out WAAAY in CB's favor. 
Thanks for seemingly having some urgency. 
If I may make a suggestion.  First,  the appropriate window of time for a client's money to be tied up due to a bug/glitch is 72 hours AT THE VERY MOST. Ideally it should be resolved within 24-48 hours, being as you work at an Internet based company with no recourse for your customers if an issue arises. 
The burden on your company for prompt support resolution is Increased due to your industry leading position...11 days is Busch league and you know it. 
Good luck to you and I wish you well.

THANKS FOR CHECKING IN! Weather's kinda windy but mild here.  How's it over there in the Coinbase headquarters?
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:48:44
Apparently not.  So fuck them. I will tell 1,000 people each day how utterly terrible their company is until I see my money.  Then I'll step it down a notch and only tell 999/day.

Here it says from Jan. 1st to 17th there was an issue with PayPal sells that is now fixed.  Any sell made during this time will AUTOMATICALLY be credited back into your CB account.

Fucking scheister scheming money changers.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:53:25
???? Wtf man. So you weren't doing illegal shit with your coins and have given up on them?
FUCK THAT SHIT, my friend.
I'll fly to San Francisco myself and spend 10x the amount tied up to fuck with dishonest, thieving businesses.
I've been a small business owner for many years now.  I have 2 rules when it comes to my business.  1)Do not harm others in pursuit of profit. 2) Do not mislead or misrepresent my customers in pursuit of a sale.  
I could be a bastard fuck sitting on a mountain of money(skinning people once),  but I prefer to sleep at night with a clean conscience. I still make enough to live comfortably and also have the benefit of making lifelong, loyal customers in the process. 
It's not a difficult concept. 
I guess when you have venture capitalists to answer to you tend to take the "skin 'em" approach. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:15:03
At least PayPal will tell you over the phone to fuck off.
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:01:44
" I'd say 99% of people don't fault coinbase and would continue being cool with them after issues if CB had decent support. Livechat would be pretty badass. A fucking phone number too"  
THIS times a million.   
If you're some stand up paddleboard startup company from Glendale, sure...go ahead and have 2 guys casually replying to emails.  If you control access to peoples btc or money ergo control whether people get their mortgage paid on time,  GET A FUCKING MANNED PHONE LINE OR CHAT SUPPORT.

Good man! Incoming calls abound!
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:04:36
**edit... do people really sell drug proceed btc's through coinbase??? Jesus Christ.  That's absolutely retarded. 
It's a nice thought,  but I wouldn't even know where to go to get on the darknet. I'm just a lover of currency, coins, commodities, etc.  I think btc is a pretty cool idea,  and I like to back that idea with a little cash.  A deflationary digital currency is a hell of a concept. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:51:04
I got an email back from am actual person yesterday evening, but all it said was "I'm not an engineer so I can't actually do anything,...but I'll pass your case on to the next person"
Fucking 'ELL, man.  Free my shit up.  If the sell isn't working and you know it, disable sells on your fucking site. Don't let people get their money trapped up on this no phone having,  no ceo having b.s. of a company.

How long has your situation been unresolved?
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:51:28
Lol.  Btc bought off of CB over the years. I (*used to) buy small amounts fairly regularly when I felt it was undervalued. Sell when price is high or I need some quick cash. 
**edit 1- I forgot about circle...they made up probably 75% by volume of my buys... but still the fact stands that I've bought more than sold on CB over the years. 
***edit 2-  And again, I repeat...this is not a KYC issue. This is an issue stemming from coinbase's sell to PayPal feature malfunctioning.  They acknowledge it buried deep on this page  , but good luck finding it on your own. The statuses have changed over time...on the 16th it said they acknowledged having issues with PayPal sells throughout the month of January.  The 7th-16th is what i remember. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:33:21
Probably slow confirmations that have been plaguing blocks as of late.  But who knows.

That is pretty ridiculous
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:22:30
Point being if you haven't had an issue yet it's only a matter of time. 
And when that time comes you have NO RECOURSE in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:04:05
SEVEN days. not SEVERAL. 
I know,  semantics, and all,...
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:26:02
Ohhh for sure.  I'm all for the southern charm&gt;fiery gates of hell technique of call center etiquette.  There's about 20 steps in between.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:54:04
I am not under a compliance review,  for the record.  
I am not doing sketchy shit. 
I initiated a PayPal sell on the 16th of this month...something I've done a dozen times before. I have every level of Coinbase's KYC verification set up and have since day one. 
Once the PayPal money didn't show up in my account I dug around about 5 pages deep into coinbase's site to find that they posted a known error/bug with their PayPal sells from around the 7th-16th of this month. 
You would think if there was a known issue for over a week with a certain part of CB's site, they would disable it or at least post a prominent warning or send out an email to the user base, like a reputable company would.
An ounce of prevention, so the saying goes.
  There are several simple, good business practices that are lacking on several fronts,here. 
Do not sully my name in this matter. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:30:02
Sorry about your luck.  I would call your bank and tell them coinbase is perhaps engaging in fraudulent activities. 
And after you perhaps get your money back ( They've made mine disappear for almost 10 days now with no recourse) STOP USING COINBASE

@_date: 2017-01-27 10:42:53
Ohh im well aware.  "If you don't hold it you don't own it" works very well in practice with Gold and silver.  Btc on the other hand (in theory) should work the same way...I'm not quite sure how to adopt those same practices for btc, though.
If a thief comes and robs me of gold I can shoot him. I can't really shoot a digital thief.
