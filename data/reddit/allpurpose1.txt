I don't recall ever doing that for electrum? Is there no way I can get it back?

Wow... holy shit... I'm so fucking angry at this situation right now. I'm sorry about that. Please pm your bitcoin address and I'll send when I can. My electrum wallet is acting up on sending because i don't have enough confirmations, but I'lll get it to you

I tried that, but nothing happened

I might actually have something like that. I saved it for something but not sure if it was for electrum. I guess I can try it out. Where do I input it?

Man... this is so fucked up. I feel really bad about it and even worse I feel like a dumbass for falling for something like that. I appreciate the help and generosity. I'll keep your username saved and one day once I have more bitcoin I'll give you a bigger cut for all this. Sorry again

I'm not sure what that is. Where can I find it? Thank you, I'm a noob at this sorry.
