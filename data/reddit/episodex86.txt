Unfortunately this is why Bitcoin will never be serious currency for massess. Do you need to disable all extensions when using your online banking? Do you worry all the time if your money in bank is safe from hackers? Do you need to be paranoid about your security?
I like the Bitcoin idea, but in my opinion it's too fragile to become dominant ever.

But today you didn't learn what a humour is ;)

I don't think in this case it's dumb. People that are new to Bitcoin don't think in matters of investment etc. They want to have something that makes so much buzz and is said to be profitable. And now imagine such person, that bought 0.1BTC, telling his friend (not BTC owner) that he bought some BTC. Friends asks how much does he have, and what he answers? "Er... just 0.1 you know, but er.. it's a lot in $$!" - just saying "0.1" is embarassing (again checked on my friends). If mBTC becomes standard way of thinking about bitcoins he would say "I bought 100 mBTC" and even though it's the same amount it sounds *a lot* better. 
Does this make people dumb? Maybe, I don't know. At least we're not machines :).

You just don't get psychology :). I told many friends about bitcoin and at first it was like this:
- Hey, maybe you'll buy some BTC?
- How much is it?
- $700
- Oh, can't afford
- But you can buy 0.1 for example
- Meh, that's so little for so much money, no way...
Now imagine the same talk but starting with:
- Hey, maybe you'll buy some mBTC?
- How much is it?
- $0.7 per one
