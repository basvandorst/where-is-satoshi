Close but not quite: I am starting with the assumption that the money supply must have some mechanism (not necessarily a central authority, democratic vote could work as well) for counter-balancing inflation and deflation in order for it to be stable and useful as a tool for capital investment.
Unfortunately the only system I know of that has this mechanism is one of a centralized bank. I don't like crony capitalism any more than you do. However I am concerned that Bitcoin has not solved this stability problem, so I am now of the opinion that Bitcoin isn't really a viable alternative to fiat currency.
I am just brainstorming here, but lets say Bitcoin could adjust the number of coins available to the network as easily as it can adjust the difficulty of coin mining. So it could add more coins to make up for destroyed coins or take away coins in the case of rapid inflation. That would be incredibly useful and would solve the problem completely -- assuming this could be determined by entirely mechanical means without any central authority, much like how the mining difficulty can be chosen.
Alas, the number of coins is intimately tied to the hash function, and finding which nonce value produces the desired number of zeros at the end. So the current design of Bitcoin could never allow for an adjustable maximum number of coins.

I am well aware of that. But loss of currency causes deflation, which increases the value of **all** assets, including debts. Who wants to use a currency in a system where the amount of money you owe for a loan could never be payed back because it becomes perpetually more difficult to get your hands on the money to actually pay it back? So what, Bitcoin should never be used for loans, or else any loans must be adjusted over time for the amount of currency remaining in the system? Would anyone ever take that system seriously? I could be wrong, but I don't think anyone will.
The Bitcoin Wiki downplays this issue, but I think this Mt. Gox disaster shows that the rate at which coins will be lost is **much faster** than had been anticipated. This is a real big problem.

I am talking about people's trust in Bitcoin, which is the only factor decides it's value.
Basically, since there are a fixed number of coins, it is a system of economics that suffering from the exact same problems the US had when the dollar was pegged to the value of gold: in short, that you cannot stabilize fluctuations in value by simply putting more money into circulation or taking less money out of circulation. As a consequence, the currency becomes less useful to people who need to have some way of calculating risk, because it is so unpredictable. This makes it useless for serious investors.
So, if you think it is OK that Bitcoin just be a secondary currency that is only used for transferring wealth in certain cases, like transferring value between fiat currencies of different governments, I can go along with you on that. But using it as real money will never happen, not unless the problem of deflation can be addressed.

 like I said, I hope for everyone's sake that the coins did only switch hands. If the government was behind this theft, they could, and likely will, destroy the coins to make the currency untrustworthy and unusable.

I hope for everyone's sake that Mt. Gox or whoever has stolen the coins intends to spend them so they go back into circulation. If 750Kbtc were destroyed, plus the 144Kbtc seized from Silkroad is close to 900Kbtc. Out of 21 million, that is 4.28% of all coins in the current block chain destroyed so far.
If I were working for the US government, had the NSA at my disposal, and I were charged with destroying Bitcoin, attacking large Bitcoin trading centers like Mt. Gox is exactly how I would go about doing it. A few more major hits like this and all trust in Bitcoin will evaporate and that will be the end of it. It may continue to find a nich in black markets, otherwise, its odds of becoming a legitimate currencty are fading away.
So this **is** a problem with Bitcoin, not Mt. Gox, unless everyone figures out how a better security scheme to prevent intentional destruction of coins. Otherwise it is just a matter of waiting for the next big pooled mining operation to be robbed and see all of their wallets erased.
The mining difficulty can be reduced to try to encourage an influx of new coins into the system, but that won't prevent another Mt. Gox collapse. What happens when, say 20 million bitcoins have been destroyed? The remaining 1 million will be enough to make the currency useful as a serious currency?

This gives me some hope. But going completely underground (entirely within a darknet) is difficult, and with increased technological barrier to its use comes decreased popularity and decreased value.

How to block Bitcoin's usage? The same way you block BitTorrents usage, by hitting the ISPs. They don't need any evidence of wrong doing whatsoever, they just need to accuse you of wrongdoing and your ISP cancels your contract. This scares people into not using it. Who wants to risk having their Internet cancelled?
The RIAA/MPAA spends billions every year sending threatening letters to ISPs around the world. If they detect you are using BitTorrent they send a threatening letter to your ISP claiming they have evidence of you stealing movies (of course they have no evidence at all). Your ISP then cancels your contract and suspends your internet service indefinitely -- with absolutely no real evidence of wrongdoing. More than 99% of all cases go completely undisputed, it's easier just to stop using BitTorrent than to risk losing your Internet access. Thus the RIAA/MPAA get exactly what they want, ironically at the cost far greater than what they loose from pirating movies. But I digress.
So, what happens when someone even more evil and corrupt than the RIAA or MPAA decide Bitcoin is a threat to their current business model? And who could be more evil and corrupt than the RIAA/MPAA? And who could see Bitcoin as a threat to their business? I dunno, maybe Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup?
It won't be big government that kills Bitcoin, it will big big corporations (who, incidentally, *are* the government now).
I won't be comfortable until the Bitcion protocol can be used over Tor, which will be difficult if you understand why it is impossible to cover your use of BitTorrent with Tor.

That's a good point, but hypothetically Bitcoin is still useful even if you cannot exchange it for fiat currency. It is also impossible to prevent people from exchanging paper wallets for ordinary cash, so you can't shut down all exchanges, you can only shut down the popular, convenient ones.
However, take away the peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin becomes completely worthless. The easiest way to stop Bitcoin is to threaten ISPs with litigation. ISPs do *not* give a shit about you if there is even the slightest chance they will be sued. They already know you are using Bitcoin. So unless it is completely done within fully VPN, friend-to-friend network, ISPs are the best targets.

I don't think this would be effective at all. Bitcoin is hypothetically still useful even if you cannot exchange it for fiat currency easily. The exchanges are just convenient, popular places to buy fiat currency with Bitcoin. Even if they are all shut down, nothing is stopping you from trading your paper wallet for cash, and that counts as an exchange, even if it is much less convenient.

Let me rephrase that: covering your use of BitTorrent with Tor is largely ineffective because of how BitTorrent finds peers, and because it is difficult to prevent your request from traveling through an exit node to an unprotected network. Of course, doing it completely within a darknet is possible, but this is very inconvenient and often it's just faster to do a direct download over VPN from a friend.
If people were forced to use Bitcoin only within darknets or friend-to-friend networks, this would make it a very inconvenient and unpopular currency which will drive down it's value. They know this, and that's how they will win.
