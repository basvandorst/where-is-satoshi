Essentially you have two IP addresses. You have an internal IP address that is arbitrary and assigned by sprint and an external IP address which is owned by sprint. The internal ip address is unique to you and the external address is used by many devices through the magic of NAT.
The internal address that sprint has assigned to you just happens to fall under what the DoD uses in the real world. They could just as easily assign you an address that google owns or whatever because it is used internally only.

I have a few shares of this. There seem to be so many variables with mining, it will be interesting to see what my return ends up being

I have been using havelock for a few months now and my deposit address has never changed.

I was in the same situation and I ended up investing in one of the funds on havelockinvestments.com. In particular take a look at the petamine fund. The management has a good relationship with the asic producers and I when I did the math the ROI was much higher. The price per share has gone up recently, so do your own due diligence... but it is definitely an option.

*I was hoping to get a good response from dish, and I did. Reddit is magic. See my edit above.* 
You must not have dealt with dish support. I spent an over an hour on the phone with them two weeks ago to add a wireless receiver. They wanted me to sign another two year contract because I had to upgrade my equipment. It was very frustrating. I wanted to pay them more money and they wanted me to sign a contract. I hate contracts. Its not like they give me the equipment... I am just renting it.
And then after we agreed on no contract, the installer came and tried to have me sign a two year contract.
Asking them questions about bitcoin... I can just imagine how smoothly that will go.

If I cancel my credit card autopay I lose my free hd for life... which I think is a $10 a month charge. 
I would like to pay with bitcoin, anyone know a way around this? I just feel like if I pay in bitcoin I might get double charged when it comes to the end of the month. 
** EDIT: Got a response from dish. If you pay 7 days prior to your due date then it will not process the auto pay.

Think of 4G as just a big LAN, but instead of the 192.168.X.X ip addresses, sprint is using 21.X.X.X ip addresses

This is exactly what I did and something similar happened to me. I think the electroncash wallet is pulling data from the wrong chain in some cases. Sometimes it shows my post fork bitcoin transactions and sometimes not. I would assume that is based on the server it is connected to.
I didnt intend on keeping the bitcoincash... and closing and opening the electroncash application a few times allowed me to send the BCH coins to an exchange.
 I would look at your addresses on a bitcoin block explorer and a bitcoin cash block explorer and see what the real deal with your coins is.
