To the general UK population, it would come across as malicious.
I personally find it great

This is great, I am glad that you are also helping push Bitcoin further.

My problem is when my balance drops below $200...
Thats when the OCD kicks in

Bitcoin is not dead or alive...

It seemed like BTC was portrayed as a currency used by crooks to buy drugs, but in most situations its anything but that.
And i also feel as if they didn't highlight many of BTCs pros

I would assume that we all expected this...
Even back when the FBI were looking for Kevin Mitnick, they were still using dirty tactics to find him, even if it seemed 'out of their power' and simply wrong.
Thats why I never take the FBI's word for anything and I doubt that they would be able to use anything that is considered 'legal' for a normal person to do, but instead they yet again decide to play dirty and bend the rules; And as we have come to see, the FBI don't seem to like the rules that us normal citizens must follow.

I have a feeling that the opportunity to send with your email will take away some of Bitcoin's anonymity which may not rub off the right way for certain people.

Coinbase allows comments

10/10 for you good sir

Its not much considering how much people have made by abusing Stellars

Part of the problem lies in the media. Some of the most recent news articles I have read on mainstream media were showing BTC as somewhat of a criminals money in relation to Silkroad and other TOR sites

Thanks for the response.
I just find it a bit strange that whenever I go all in, it hits a mine on the first one.

I almost ignored it...
