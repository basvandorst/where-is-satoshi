Chainlink it is
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:55:20
So he photoshopped it into the video? Cool
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:06:28
Exactly my point...

Because  charlie lee, litecoin's founder tweeted that LTC is going on a all-out marketing campaign a few days ago. And tech wise LTC is superior :) 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:37:57
Lol sheeple go on and think it's fake
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:43:47
Why r u so mad lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:47:12
Ask him why he's being a hypocrite by calling bitcoin a fraud while his company gets investigate for fraud a while back 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:35:37
Yep and he would go to that extent just to defame Mcafee? What has he got to gain from it. He asked a genuine question to review Enigma(ENG) that's it.

 the haters, i was just pointing the fomo involved in this post, if u had bought litecoin (objectively the most rational investment decision) you'd be up 200% from time of this post
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:27:06
Errr can't u see that there is a blue verification check?? The fake account DO NOT HAVE IT
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:26:16
Yes XVG is good. However normies who literally just got into crypto like 5 days ago(can tell from their Twitter) are shilling it to levels of 'XVG IS THE NEXT BITCOIN, XVG TO $15. It is not healthy, Mcafee should AT LEAST say he is getting paid promotions. Also is it surprising that 1. All his shills are low prices coins, 2. XVG shill coincide with wraith protocol release/DGB shill coincide with OKEx listing, 3. Electroneum is just known for their PR shills not surprised if they paid him to do it.
Cannot imagine normies coming in thinking electroneum will change the world...

Calm down cupcakes
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:04:43
Errr why would  fake it considering he gave tips to Mcafee, and also, if I hadn't posted his he has ZERO intention to gain popularity, please at least go through his Twitter feeds.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:36:00
Enigma does not need shills to be top 10 coin, go on and be delusional although all evidence are presented. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:41:55
Still I don't see any reason why  would fake it considering he gave Mcafee tips. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:09:19
Go see his full Twitter feed, see that he posted the video for clarification almost immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:10:00
Nope i just cannot stand him shilling shitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:36:44
Well McAfee called it Bircoin
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:08:17
Okay even though all evidence points otherwise 
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:39:33
He thinks he's about to make it

Thanks for the clarification, will edit

Which also means bcash has no grounds to outright claim that it is the real bitcoin. The closest way of measuring is the coin with most hash rate/total work accumulated. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:48:37
Getting sick of the 'Bcash is is the real bitcoin' nonsense.
1. The real bitcoin is whichever coin that has community's consensus, largest accumulated work done, largest hash rate out of the fork.
2. Following satoshi's whitepaper is not a criteria for being named 'Bitcoin'
The community has to come together to stop this fraud from propogating!
