The millennials may have money in the future. But I disagree with your point that businesses must target them or die: they can do well by selling to all generations that are currently alive.

It’s a very limited distributed computing system though. You can’t run anything significant on it, like you can on AWS.

Bitcoin is an open source project, not a closed product created by a private company run by corporate drones. It should be compared to Linux, which has also gained value through large scale adoption and has evolved from very humble beginnings.

Bitcoin has more developers than Ethereum. This can verified by looking at their GitHub repos. The whole MySpace comparison is lazy and weak. Regarding Ethereum having better developers, have you ever looked at their GitHub pages? If not, what do you base this observation on? I think you are the one who doesn’t understand the space.

I'm buying back in - got some bitcoin this morning at $13K. If it goes down some more I'll buy some more. A couple of months from now the price will be higher, and we'll get lots of people asking when the next dip will be so they can buy back in. It'll be too late then.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:43:32
It's been less than a month since it was at $19K. I think you are going to be waiting a lot longer for it to get back to $19K, although I do believe that one day it may get back there. It might not though.

It doesn't have to go to zero for bitcoin to be the main currency in use. There have been quite  a few periods in recent history of hyperinflation, where there would be a strong reason to use bitcoin. That describes the situation in Venezuela and Zimbabwe right now and Germany after WW1. Given the way the US government is totally incapable of responding to financial crises, and relies on short terms hacks like quantitive easing, massive inflation could easily happen there too. Do you believe the government of the USA is in any way competent right now? Are you familiar with why bitcoin was initially created?

So how would you implement a non- trivial social media platform or a decentralized exchange using simple scripts and slow, expensive distributed storage? These are applications I see people stating Ethereum can be used for (including someone earlier in this thread).

I am arguing with your statement that businesses must target some specific generation or they will die. They can succeed by targeting all generations that are alive at the same time.

@_date: 2018-01-22 15:00:10
I totally agree with you. But they are competitors in the minds of people who are investing in Ethereum, who do not understand what it is about. The majority of people investing in Ethereum right now are doing so because they believe it is a better bitcoin. Very few people understand the value (if any) of Ethereums decentralized platform for running smart contracts. That is why I think Ethereum is a risky investment right now.

I think if you own bitcoin right now the best strategy is to hold on to it and not worry about the price for the next year. If you are very concerned about the price, then it may not be the best investment for you at this time. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:24:30
None. I think some of the other coins will succeed in the long term. But I do not have any confidence to guess which ones will succeed. Since I do feel confident that bitcoin will succeed in the long term, that is where I invest all my money. I also believe the store of value use case that bitcoin addresses is the one that has the most value to me as an individual.

Like in Venezuela today. Why would we lose internet access? We would still have currency, it just wouldn’t be fiat currency. Fiat currency is a recent invention, things worked fine before then.

Ethereum can handle a larger number of transactions than bitcoin right now, but that doesn’t mean it scales well. Scaling is a function how well something performs as a function of the size of its inputs, not how well it performs for a single input size. I know scalability is a concern for the Ethereum developers right now, which is why they are working on sharding. Sharding is a hack, so I am concerned they already need to resort to this.

In the long term I am more concerned about the instability in the value of the US dollar (and other government issued currencies). That's why I hold bitcoin. The short term instability in the US dollar price of bitcoin doesn't concern me at all.

Both Plasma and Raiden are ways to handle Ethereums scaling problems. Which means Ethereum has a scaling problem. Which is the point I’m making. People keep saying Ethereum runs more transactions than bitcoin, so it scales better. I am pointing out this is not true. Also one of my problems with Ethereum is that it has so many deeply technical projects going on right now that I am pretty sure no one can understand them all, whereas bitcoin seems simple in comparison. This is why I will not invest in Ethereum, as I believe very few people investing in it right now actually understand it.

The block chain cannot provide low latency distributed storage comparable to Amazon S3, which is what I was referring to. By load balancing I was referring to load balancing a service behind a single IP address. I really believe that no-one who is involved in Ethereum or who is investing in it understands that it is totally incapable of serving the primary use case it has been designed for, which is a platform for distributed computing. That’s why I believe it is bullshit.

True HODLers don't care what the price is relative to fiat, and don't give a fuck that the price is going down. They are hodling bitcoin to use when fiat becomes worthless. My own take on this is that I am holding bitcoin as a *hedge* against fiat becoming worthless. I think there is a good chance of this happening in my lifetime. I haven't invested my life savings into bitcoin, and would actually prefer fiat not to become worthless: life would be easier for me if the fiat system keeps on going.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:56:57

@_date: 2018-01-22 12:27:38
Is this a serious response?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:44:39
But do you seriously believe you can run non-trivial distributed systems in Ethereum? Once you start building real applications needing load balancing, distributed storage, guaranteed 99.9% up time, low latency communication between servers (which you get for machines in the same data center), distributed authentication and authorization, you need something like AWS. I don't see how Ethereum can provide all these. Which is why I think Ethereum is bullshit. If I am wrong about this I would love to be corrected.

Warren Buffet invested billions of dollars into IBM a few years back, right after I left the company to join Amazon. I thought at the time it was the stupidest investment decision anyone could make. Everyone told me I was an idiot for questioning Warren Buffet. Since that time IBM's stock price has languished around $150, and they have had 24 quarters of declining revenue. Amazon's stock has gone from $190 to $1200. Warren Buffet doesn't understand tech. I regard him bashing bitcoin to be a very strong buy signal.

Well I have a tendency to believe that assets are over-priced that I am very aware of. For instance, I work at Amazon.com and joined in 2011 when the stock was $190. I sold a lot of my stock a couple of years later at $300, as I thought the price was ridiculous. I was (very) wrong. Right now I am willing to make a bet that I am wrong again. So far I am correct about being wrong - since I bought earlier today at $11.6K bitcoin has gone to $13.5K.

I am guessing you work in finance and have a good knowledge of financial markets, so you assume that your knowledge gives you a "special" understanding of the value of bitcoin that other people don't have. My understanding of the value of bitcoin is not based on how financial markets work, I consider this to be mostly irrelevant. I could be wrong however, and you could be right. I don't claim my understanding is better than yours. But I continue to disagree with you that a strong knowledge of macro-economics is pre-requisite for understanding the value of bitcoin. It depends on how you choose to value bitcoin, whether it is based on it's market behavior, or it's potential to become a global store of value independent of the influence of any one government.

Technology is totally a selling point. A store of value running on a massively distributed computer network secured by cryptography uses a lot of technology.

Here is the wikipedia definition of macro-economics:
"Macroeconomics is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. This includes regional, national, and global economies.[1][2] Macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, and the interrelations among the different sectors of the economy to better understand how the whole economy functions. They also develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, and international finance." 
How does this relate to the scarcity model of bitcoin value that I referenced?

 Condescending again. You can’t help yourself.
What macro economic considerations are embedded in the scarcity model I cited? Do you actually understand mathematical modeling?

Depends on the value of k. For k=0, 100k = 10k.

Drinking and bitcoin trading are not a good combination. Drinking and posting on reddit on the other hand can be a great combination.

I agree the value of bitcoin is not valued only based on the technology. However the technology itself is what allows bitcoin to exist in the first place. A CS degree is definitely helpful in understanding bitcoin. I completely disagree that you need a strong knowledge of macro-econmonics - that is completely unnecessary and stating otherwise is very condescending to the very many people here who completely see the potential value of bitcoin.

Good to hear it's not just me!

I think what you say here makes quite a bit of sense. I was also quite taken aback by some of the price predictions in this thread. I  would have expected most people would be over the idea of bitcoin being a get rich quick scheme by now. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:37:16
I'm planning to start buying more soon. I think the price has a little further to fall first.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:14:45
Google “how do I buy bitcoin”
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:23:52
Nice! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:32:29
3rd choice: buy now.
4th choice: buy later at a much lower price. This is my plan.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:13:40
Don't listen to others here. You have lost much less than many people here who are still hodling. If you plan to buy any more though I would just buy a small amount each day and DCA.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:12:54
I bought 4
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:34:55
I'm beginning to think the drama of bitcoin is the best thing about being invested in it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:40:53
The world isn't ending. The rest of the world doesn't give a fuck about bitcoin. It is just not that important. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:49:39
Yes, congratulations! 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:09:45
Not me. I bought last time it dipped to $6k and I will do so again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:33:55
Good point. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:47:55
I'm not at all convinced we'll get a big explosion. I think there is a pretty good chance bitcoin will be worth a lot less than $10K by the end of the year. People are still expecting the value of bitcoin to increase dramatically, which indicates to me that we are not out of the correction yet. There are still too many people who are buying bitcoin because they believe it will make them rich quickly. That is a good sign we are still in a bubble.

So looking at your medical marijuana use case, don’t you need a lot of input data to process the legal requirements for the on Blockchain transactions? I am assuming you can’t communicate directly from the Ethereum platform to the external computing services that provide the input data e.g. user authentication, systems which store prescriptions. In which case this data needs to be gathered by some off Blockchain client application. So if that is the case, why not have the client application enforce the legal requirements and just use the Blockchain to exchange monetary value?

If sentiment is the primary driver behind the price of bitcoin then it is definitely a bad investment, given how easily sentiment is manipulated. Fortunately I believe you are wrong : I believe bitcoin actually has real value based on its technology. If I didn't believe you are wrong I would sell all my bitcoin immediately.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:34:04
Why's that? I thought bitcoin is old technology and irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:17:20
YesNoMaybe - I agree with gypsytoy here - I don't see any compelling use cases for on blockchain smart contracts. In fact the majority of people I know who are investing in Ethereum cannot even explain to me what smart contracts are. Can you give us some examples of specific use cases for smart contracts that might convince someone that Ethereum is worth investing in? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:18:59
I did! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:14:02
You will regret this soon
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:07:19
My point of view is that the more people who invest in bitcoin the harder it will become for the government to shut it down... But it sounds to me that you are not expecting bitcoin to make you rich quickly - you seem to be informed about the risks and are willing to hold for a long period of time.

When no time zone is given then you should assume UTC.

Ah ok sorry - missed that. Nice tongue in cheep!
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:03:42
Yes, disappointing. Hopefully it will go lower in the next few days. Hoping to buy a few more bitcoin before it shoots back up again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:43:41
You are practicing a well known trading strategy called buy high sell low. Another strategy you might want to consider is to buy low sell high. This can be more profitable in the long run.

TCP/IP certainly does have some flaws, and alternatives have been proposed to address these. In what ways do you consider bitcoin to be imperfect?

You seem to know nothing at all about history. The American government made ownership of gold illegal during the depression:
The police in America can legally seize assets for no good reason, and without due process, in order to fund their operations. There has been widespread reporting of abuses of this program:
The German government during World War 2 confiscated gold and jewelry from many of its citizens. I guess in your mind being Jewish means you are a criminal, but a lot of Jewish people might disagree.
You are either remarkably stupid or living in a rich protected bubble (probably both).

Bitcoin doesn’t have to displace the currency of any country for it to have value. In the long term however, I believe bitcoin has a higher chance of survival than any fiat currency.

You are kind of weird and sad. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:17:04
This is the funniest post I’ve read in a while. The whole point of bitcoin is that it is not controlled by any company or the federal reserve. You are the snowflake. And a very stupid one at that.

Feeling really good about hodling from 19K right now!

I agree totally. There are a few people who do get bitcoin and have interesting things to say, like cryptogrip and some others, but everyone else is just noise.

I don’t understand - if something is free why can’t you afford it? Does this mean that people who are in debt are not entitled to things that are free? Your reasoning is pretty weak, even for a troll.
