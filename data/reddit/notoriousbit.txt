Haha yes. Anytime I see anything on the news that I actaullly know a bit about I realise this.

Because bitcoin is probably the most free market capitalist thing in the history of economics.  The cool thing is that the leftys haven't worked that out yet hehe

"Having money that is not entirely controlled by a single group of people..."
then why not apply that logic to healthcare, military, the court system, education ?

Cool answer.  It's refreshing to read a non-emotional argument.  I don't agree with you but thanks anyway :) My definition of a free market is one where you are not FORCED to participate.  This might not be your definition or that of others you have read but just so you know this is where my reply is coming form.  We might never agree on what the best way to look after our health so why not lets go our separate ways and see who ends up better offi? As long as I'm not forced to pay or participate in your choice and you are not forced into mine then so be it.  If some people never want to use crypto currency and keep using fiat then I have no desire to force them to change.  A free market solution does not necessarily have to have anything to do with (financial) profits.  Charity and friendly societies are part of the free market but are not for profit.  You and I make no profit from having this discussion yet here we are!
