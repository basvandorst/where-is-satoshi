I don't think crypto is going away either, but i fear a "return to the mean" from before the bubble, meaning a price of around 3000-4000$ that will keep going up slowly year after year, like any other asset.

Hey, I used to invest in crypto and got out mid-December. Key reasons for me were :
- Fear of foul play by the exchanges (closing when the price dips and the whole Tether madness)
- Lost belief in the blockchain ability to compensate for human error/stupidity and thus challenge the status quo
- Inability to read which cryptocurrency would survive once the market busts

These Gartner cycles are not hard science, it is a consulting concept (aka marketing bullshit to be honest). 
Digital money has a bright future ahead... blockchain not so much.

Frankly, at that point, cryptocurrency is dead. Its the textbook tale of the engineer that invents something cool that nobody needs.

I see two caveats with that : 
1/ If Bitcoin goes up, it should mean that people are selling USDT, therefore the amount of Tether should decrease to maintain the fixed price.
2/ The order of events is reversed. As of now, Tether volume increases BEFORE Bitcoin goes up. If the trades were legitimate, Tether volume should increase at the same time or right after bitcoin goes up

I always understood that the world's *governments* are indebted but the debt is held by private actors. So the rule isn't broken if you don't confuse governments and countries.

Today, the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed to a monthly high. Experts attribute the insane growth to the launch of the Falcon Heavy Rocket.
Osama Bin Mc Arthur, an expert at Gawker Reborn says that the gains make this the best possible time to buy more cryptocurrency.
Also rising in the crypto market this morning is cryptokitties, which saw its all-time high this morning.
The driving factor behind the dramatic fluctuations seems to be talks of Uganda contemplating buying one bitcoin.
