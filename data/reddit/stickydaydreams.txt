What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:20:17
Why's it ridiculous? Seems consistent with other securities trading. If you have stock and sell it to buy shares in another company then that's all taxable too. There are systems that automate that process and execute just as often as any mining pool. People who day trade with cryptos need to admit some fault for thinking the IRS wouldn't be coming for their cut eventually.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the way you wrote this, but I don't think that's true. COIN is just a pile of 100,000 BTC that investors would be able to buy in increments of 0.01 BTC (100 shares = 1 BTC). The supply of COIN is limited by the security's underlying assets, not the total Bitcoin supply.
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:51:25
Don't take this the wrong way, but "6 or 7 figures" is a preposterous price target that I have to assume you pulled out of your ass. $1,000,000/BTC in today's USD mean the coin's market cap would be about five times the amount of all the world's currency in circulation right now. That doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:40:42
Then why does anything ever get approved by the SEC? Securities can always crash or fail in some manner.
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:08:41

Yep. Anyone with access to a Bloomberg Terminal, check out the COIN ETF company filings. There's an SEC Prospectus every time they want to add a sentence to their website.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:58:16
Wow, I can't believe I've never heard that.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:34:13
I'll go against the grain here. There are several reasons to not approve the ETF.
* Bitcoin may be confusing and scary for people who aren't tech savvy. I couldn't find the mean age of the people voting on COIN, but I'd imagine it's high.
* There will be concerns over protecting investors in the event of theft. COIN won't operate like a traditional ETF, it just holds 100,000 BTC and you're buying fractions of that pool. The application specifically says there's no insurance in case somebody steals those coins. If you buy a bunch of COIN, and somebody steals those 100,000 BTC, you just lost all your money. Critics will point to Mt. Gox losing 850,000 as evidence that Bitcoin isn't secure. There's at least one other proposed Bitcoin ETF that will insure their holdings (I'm blanking on the name).
* The SEC resists listing highly volatile securities (think penny stocks or certain leveraged funds). Bitcoin is still way more volatile than most (all?) commodities. 
* The SEC's job above all else is to protect shareholders. The government has little to no regulatory power over BTC, that will make people uncomfortable - especially people who aren't as tech-savvy as the average BTC holder. I'd imagine that's most of the SEC.
I'd say it's overwhelmingly likely there will be some type of BTC ETF in the next 3 years. That said, I'm not convinced one will get through one the very first application or that the Winklevoss twins have structured this one in a way that protects investors. I would love to see it approved but don't expect that.
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:30:55
It wouldn't be linear growth, though. The leap from $1000 to $2000 is a lot bigger than from $34k to $35k.
Although I think a $500B market cap in three years' time is improbable bordering on delusional.
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:33:56

@_date: 2017-02-11 01:05:11
I've never heard of this, why would miners consent to raising the cap? Wouldn't it dilute the value of the BTC already in circulation? If BTC supply is scarce, the natural solution has always seemed to be using mBTC/bits/satoshis as a base unit.

There are surely people better qualified to answer this, but here are a few reasons. Someone please correct me if I say anything wrong.
* There may be concerns over protecting investors in the event of theft. COIN won't operate like a traditional ETF, it just holds 100,000 BTC and you're buying fractions of that pool. The application specifically says there's no insurance in case somebody steals those coins. If you buy a bunch of COIN, and somebody steals those 100,000 BTC, you just lost all your money.

@_date: 2017-02-17 05:38:18
The mechanics of withdrawing BTC from a personal account are different from completely wiping out an exchange though (I'd imagine). The reason past hacks are important is that they've set the precedent that hundreds of thousands of coins can disappear instantly. If a theft of that magnitude were to happen on the SEC's watch it would be a huge setback for BTC and other cryptocurrencies; cold storage has to be absolutely airtight before any kind of approval (especially if you're not offering theft insurance, as the Winklevoss twins have refused to do).
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:03:17
There's no new information here, this doesn't mean COIN was approved
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:21:07
Even that would mean completely overtaking the USD. I used 7 figures for my number.

@_date: 2017-02-27 03:25:47
Yeah but what explains the difference in dates a security is listed whether the SEC doesn't reach a ruling (which I don't expect) or approves it? It makes no sense to me that an approval would delay trading as opposed to not denying it.

100% agree. I bought my first Bitcoins in 2011. It was new and fascinating and exciting and everything that the old-school financial sector wasn't.
Since then, the community's attitude and inability to have serious dialogue about Bitcoin's problems worries the hell out of me. We laugh at "shitcoins". The amount of "m00n!!!" shitposts point to a population that's more concerned with easy money in the short-term than reinventing how we think of currency. People fawn over stories about miners worth millions after almost no work. Critics in the past who dismissed Bitcoin as a pyramid scheme were shooed off, but the religious "HODL" mantra here makes me reconsider those warnings. And the reason that gets repeated so much isn't that it's necessarily the correct move, but Bitcoiners profit off of every new person who buys and holds coins. Isn't one of the core tenets of Bitcoin that people should truly own their money and do with it as they please? Let them assess their own risk tolerance and decide what's best for them. The most commonly repeated sentiments on this sub are, directly or not, about personal profit. And to top it off, we have a mod team pushing an agenda and deleting inconvenient posts. This doesn't feel like a progressive and forward-thinking community, it feels *slimy*. This past week I sold all of the Bitcoin I had left. I'll still lurk around here but it's my opinion that Bitcoin's best days are in the past.

I'm a noob to cryptos in general, can you expand on this?
1. Why is Ethereum's scripting language bad?
2. I've read there will be around 100,000,000 ETH max in our lifetime (~89,000,000 have bee mined). For our purposes, isn't that a limit?
3. What's chain rollback? Is that like the hard fork that created ETC after the DAO hack? Goldman Sachs praised Ethereum for handling the hack that way, they said it's evidence of the technology's maturity.

Part of it has to do with the rise of Ethereum, right? It's quadrupled in value over the last month and as a consequence bitcoin dominance is at an all time low. The masses are just following the momentum at this point.

If there are no trading fees, how do you make money?
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:27:31
ETH is just the currency Ether. Ethereum is the name of the platform upon which Ether is built, but we can use the platform to create stuff. Things like applications, other currencies. 
Ethereum has some cool projects coming out. FirstBlood lets people bet their ETH and play money matches for games like LoL and Dota while other users act as a "jury" and assign funds to the winners. Augur is a decentralized prediction market, like PredictIt with a fraction of the fees. Golem will allow you to sell spare computing power to others when you're not using your hardware. There are lots of other really cool things being built but those are a couple of my favorites.
Another huge difference is that while Bitcoin and Ethereum both use Proof of Work (ie mining), Ethereum plans to eventually move to Proof of Stake (forging). PoS will let users validate the chain by "staking" their ETH, essentially receiving interest for allowing their ETH to be temporarily used as fuel. The ROI here is to be seen but it's a cool concept and one that'll be more lucrative than letting your cryptos sit in a wallet. It'll also require less power and hardware than mining, so it'll be far more energy efficient and cheaper to sustain.
