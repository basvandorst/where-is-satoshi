This is correct and very important.  My understanding from talking to several international bankruptcy lawyers is that depositors are NOT creditors, and that their funds won't be recovered through bankruptcy. Your deposits on Mt. Gox will almost certainly be determined by the court to be 100% your property, whereas creditors get a negotiated fraction of their debt. Of course, in practice, this likely means you'll need to be part of a civil suit to get any part of your money.

Erik, I cover bitcoin for Fortune.  If you'd like to get the positive perspective out on this, please get in touch.

If you'd like to support some reporting that's a little more measured, here's my story from this morning (I write for Fortune, not CNN, though they have a content sharing agreement).

Thanks guys. I always like to come here and make sure I didn't fuck up too bad.

Bitcoin-blockchain loans will be more easily enforceable than any person-to-person loan ever has been, so it will change that equation.

I get the feedback loop idea, but I really don't follow how using Bitcoin as a store of value inherently raises its value.  Without transactions, there's no value there to store.

A lot. People will write books about this era. Big, detailed, history books and biographies of early leaders.

Thinking of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle does a huge disservice to the entire project.

This is actually pretty damn disappointing, since they're not implementing micropayments. In this case, not much more likely to drive adoption than your local hotdog vendor accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:15:32
Mackysee, I'm the author of the above article and write a lot about bitcoin. I'd really like to talk to you about your situation. The dark side of bitcoin investment and optimism doesn't get enough attention.

Also, I got a swear published in Fortune.
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:10:32
This definitely seems like big news, but it seems some other commenters have a more nuanced historical viewpoint . . .

No, because he has to pay that money back to the bank, on a very definite timeline.

Oh my god, I've been waiting for YEARS to hear a cogent explanation of why the Ron Paul types "fractional reserve banking is devil worship" line is BS.  This is it, in two paragraphs.

There are many legal precedents for digital goods as property.  There's no need that it be classified as 'money' to be considered to have value, and for losing it while it's under management to be gross criminal negligence.
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:56:46
I can't entirely disagree. But luckily we're too busy working for clients to make our own site as cool as we'd like it to be. We're only a three year old company and we didn't even have a site until a year ago. Just too busy.

I'm sure there's some sort of 'signing' mechanism that's structured to be legally as well as mechanically binding.  A good point to look into.

Ah wait, I see that collecting donations is banned on these boards.  If anyone knows of a good BTC crowdfunding platform, let me know.

It's the motivation for my entire writing career.

I'm curious how they would implement micropayments without Bitcoin. I don't know of another way, but that could be ignorance.
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:50:46
Alright, I'm about to reveal how little I know about the PRACTICAL side of bitcoin . . . 
People seem to really like this article, and I have several more in the hopper along the same lines.  Would it be appropriate/smart to post a wallet address here so I can start accepting donations to fund the writing of a Bitcoin book just as smart and well-written as this?  The idea just came to me, so I don't have any formal infrastructure yet, but will be working on it over the next few days.

They're not just documented. If I'm not overstretching my knowledge, you can program the blockchain through a mutual agreement that would seize assets in the case of nonrepayment.  No lawyers involved.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:08:18
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:18:43
This is really debatable.  Bitcoin could become a store of value, but there's no compelling case for it that I've seen at this point.
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:56:24
Another vote to hear more.  Personally, I think there are actually MANY reasonable, informed reasons to be short bitcoin, and the more I learn the more I think there are some headwinds, against Bitcoin specifically though not crypto more generally. The devil is in the details.
@_date: 2014-01-22 13:49:28
Just to clarify further, the reason they didn't "create money out of thin air" is because while Bob may have $800 in cash, he's also holding an $800 debt (plus interest, some of which will ultimately go to Alice, whose money was on the line).  The two cancel each other out.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:59:57
Just as I laid the blame on my photo editors for the last article, I have to give them the credit now that there's some to give.

I think the analogy to the printing press in particular is pretty valid, but that would be a different article (probably one for an academic journal or The Atlantic).

I feel really bad for Forbes. They adopted a very loosely curated contributor model for their writers, so their quality control is really sketchy, and you could find dozens of pieces that undermine what used to be a reputable media brand (although their coverage of Hearthstone is often top-notch, so there's that).
Disclaimer - I am a journalist who works for a competing publication. And actually understands Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-30 19:57:06
I guess my only comment on this is that people still don't actually understand how bitcoin or the blockchain work. Honestly, I probably only half understand it myself.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:00:42
It has always kept my attention, just not as much of it. I still think very few people appreciate what a mind-boggling conceptual and technical achievement it is. Stupid Newsweek and their stupid "We found Satoshi Nakamoto" basically killed it as a media story, I think, but we're coming back around.
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:18:39
No. Journalists can't hold positions in companies or sectors they write about. One reason that, while I wrote for them briefly, Bitcoin Magazine and the like aren't necessarily awesome sources for news. They're structurally motivated to be positive.
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:59:17
I was writing about Bitcoin, getting paid in Bitcoin . . . then posted something to social media when I bought Bitcoin. Of course, at the time, everyone was like "It's not an investment!" and I still sort of believe that, but my editor deemed it an ethical violation and pulled me off the beat. For the kind of outlet I write for, that level of caution is pretty appropriate. I'm a fairly new journalist, so it was a learning experience.
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:21:47
Haha, I said I was a new journalist, I didn't say I was young. The collapse is basically what got me into this.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:32:32
Absolutely not. I learned my lesson.
@_date: 2015-04-30 19:58:01
Academic. Which, on a totally different topic, DON'T GO INTO ACADEMIA.

@_date: 2015-04-30 05:16:55
No. In the tech world, the bullshit artists are sometimes PR reps, but mostly CEOs themselves. And they're remarkably effective, because they believe their own line. Inexperienced journalists get caught up in the excitement, but the job is to ask hard questions.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:31:35
Maybe. I think it's more like the hype stage has passed, and now bitcoin gets covered like any other tech sector. I mean, just on the r/bitcoin front page are stories from NYT and WSJ, so it's not like it's not getting covered. You're just not going to be on the cover of Newsweek for nothing anytime soon, and BTC startups are going to have to work just as hard as anyone else to get coverage. Which is to say, if you're not Elon Musk or Tim Cook, pretty hard (and really, even they work their asses off over the long haul for the kind of heat they've got).  To be honest, BTC also attracted its share of total bullshit artists, and some of them are still around, but the shakeout is mostly over and now the grownups are talking in much quieter, more realistic tones.

Lol, my apologies, for a second I forgot I was in a Bitcoin forum. Please ignore all references to the possibility for functional government.

Actually my line of thinking was re: politics. We as a country decide through elections how much tax we want to pay, and what the revenue goes for. Not that we have perfect control, but that's the basic idea of representative government.

No cryptocoin will ever be successfully 'pegged' to the dollar.  Entire nations can't successfully and sustainably peg their currency.

@_date: 2013-12-27 16:38:30
Demurrage isn't the same as deflation.  Demurrage only goes into effect if money is unspent - it's unique to digital currency, and a lot of people think it would be good for the economy as a whole and fight income/wealth inequality if it were more widespread, since simply 'holding' assets, as opposed to investing them, would be punished.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:41:30
The best example I got of this was Freicoin, whose demurrage (decay if not spent) model couldn't possibly be incorporated into Bitcoin without fundamentally changing what Bitcoin was.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:53:14
Well, there's no question that the dogecoin massive is doing its job, promotion-wise.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:49:49
ALL currency is based, ultimately, on trust in people.  As I pointed out in my previous Fortune piece, the idea that something like gold represents 'fundamental value' is pretty much delusional.
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:40:42
Hey Redditors, could you go facebook share/tweet this if you like the article?  My editors like to see that stuff and that'll mean me getting to write more about Bitcoin.
