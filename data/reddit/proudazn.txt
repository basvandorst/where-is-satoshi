Bitcoin ATMs are being deployed into every crevice around the globe. Next year you'll be complaining about the 20 cent fee to send to your friends in Zimbabwe.
Bitcoiners MARCH ON.

And with bitcoin we can capture the work of the 10% just by owning them and watching the value rise.

Vitalik Buterin needs a proper meal, he worries this community with his skeleton like look.
Vitalik if you are reading this, head on over to your local steakhouse and go all out. Paste your BTC adress afterwards and the community will pay the bill pal.

Without Amir they would just be another rag tag group of homeless activists.

Libertarianism ruins another soul.

Another moocher who wants to live off of other people. LGBT have the same rights as everyone else they just want extra ones we don't have.

Incredible work by the legendary Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki. Taaki has done more for the project then Gavin and co could ever dream of with their github pull requests.

So why can I exchange US dollars for Euros, Canadian etc in the US and nobody asks me for palm prints, ID scans, phone number?
Robocoin is a joke.

I already wear bitcoin related clothing when I am in public. I think this is enough.

The goal of marriage is to provide a stable environment to raise children in. Families are the most decentralized units in any civilized society. Homosexual couples cannot procreate, if you put them on an island they would all die out within 1 generation. Do you NOT understand this? Homosexuals have all the same rights as everyone else, they are demanding EXTRA rights and extra privileges. Also the issue is a big distraction to larger events occuring, namely the economic problems.

Usually when the last bull has thrown in the towel, the trend reverses. Nothing screams bullish when even a core developer has given up.

I don't want to go that far. I've already given everyone at work paper wallets and ask them to pay me to fill them with mBTC.
