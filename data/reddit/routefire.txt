You know so much about Bitmex except for the fact that they don't deal in fiat. 
Typical. Suggests alternatives to Coinbase to others, has never used said alternatives.

Since you asked, ETH can handle 5x the transaction volume today (if you theoretically replace every contract with a simple transaction) and has 3x the number of nodes compared to bitcoin. Their mining is a lot more decentralized than bitcoin too.

I find that sort of thinking to be dangerous. You build the future while making use of every resource you have at present.

This is what I don't get. Hard forks would be a big problem if mining was actually decentralized. But it's not; I can fit people representing 90% of the hashpower in my living room. Maybe I'm missing something and someone can enlighten me.

It's simple; no need for conspiracy theories. Bitcoin is a "geek space" and so a large percentage of its users care about what changes are made to it. How the debate got started is a different matter but when the Core devs split, users were pretty much forced to pick sides.
@_date: 2015-12-30 07:27:15
Didn't most exchanges and miners sign the 8MB letter a while back?
Yeh, the number is more like 10%.

- Promotes competition; since Bitcoin exists people have an alternative and the govt. has to up its game. So it helps the people, not the govt.
- The govt. can have no "monetary policy" regarding Bitcoin. When used responsibly, fiat currencies being inflationary promote greater investment, growth and less unemployment.
- 90% of the population won't know how to properly secure their computers and bitcoins. It's a hacker's wet dream.
- When the country is hit the hardest, and the govt. would wish to impose capital controls, it has no power to do so.

Yes but presuming miners and exchanges agree on the change, it is hard to see why holdout nodes would stall progress. As an example, something like 15% of nodes ATM are non-Core nodes. All nodes are equal but some nodes are more equal than others.

Hey thanks so much!
Okay, regarding Reddit, it's *designed* to favor new posts over old ones. So it was inevitable that this post would go off the front page and no new people would be able to read the challenges. I suggest you crosspost (link to your post) from other subs like etc. so more people can learn about your challenges.
Something else I wanted to say is - Reddit is mostly people looking for instant gratification. I too would love to see a Bitcoin flag on Mt. Everest or next to a shark but not many people would be willing to drop everything and travel. An ideal challenge for redditors would be something that's hard but not too hard - something that can be done in their immediate surroundings. Just my 2 cents and thanks again.

By leaving it small you open the network to another kind of DOS attack. All that millions worth of hardware backing bitcoin isn't worth much when a few thousand dollars are sufficient to cripple the network with spam.
There's all this talk of why we need to keep bitcoin "decentralized" and small to protect against (what some consider) to be inevitable state sponsored attacks. Well, the easiest attack vector is still open. They did the same thing to Tor - never went after them with a warrant, just paid a bunch of researchers to try and see if they could break it.

What are the risks exactly provided that a planned Core-supported hard fork takes place? Exchanges and services can prepare for a clean fork (say a warning broadcasted on all wallets) just as they are preparing for Segwit. Obviously there's a finite probability of funds being lost but when exactly did it become a "failure mode"? There have been forks before, even unintentional ones.

By that logic, the market likes the fact that support for Segwit has stalled!
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:16:27
"Support" here means that they are ready for the transition to segwit should it activate. No exchange is going to say "We'll shut shop if segwit activates."
OP's question is different. It's about who the exchanges will support in the event of a fork.

The US legal system isn't 'corrupt' but laws like the Espionage act are 'outdated'. You forget that Snowden was pretty damn sure he would be going to US prision. He is not afraid to go back to the US and spend his life in prision. His problem is that the Espionage act requires that his hearing be held in a secret court. Thus he fears the public will not be able to see his side of the story. 
He has publicly stated he is willing to come back if some arrangement can be made such that his trial is held in a normal court.

Satoshi boarded the Marunouchi Line metro and got off at the Tokyo station. He had no plans for the day. He found a corner, lit a cigarette and peered into the vast expense that was Tokyo's railway station. "I could pay a visit to the Imperial Palace", he thought. Castles had always fascinated him as a child. Castles, Chess and Computers. He raised his head to study the exits guide.
Suddenly he realized what he had been doing there all along. A voice in his subconscious said, "Chess is very austere in that you don't have many rules, there is no randomness and the problem is very hard."
Subconscious? He had not slept for two days. She kept bothering him. 'She' in Satoshi's life was Mathematics. He had found a beautiful piece of math and shared his findings with the world. It was not enough. Nothing was ever enough. Nothing could ever offset the initial condition to all his differential equations- life's misery.
Satoshi walked to the Yamanote Line's platform. He stepped forward.

Ah, so the optimists are saying that since the (block reward + transaction fees) is fixed, increase in transactions will bring the cost/tx down.
The pessimists are saying that since we'll keep reducing the block reward, the increase in tx will never catch up and miners will switch off their machines.
That was the answer I was looking for! Thanks a bunch!

I agree with you, except the problem is the following: PC/Internet could do things phones and fax machines couldn't and that is why they were adopted. CCs could do things cash couldn't and that is why they were adopted.
I was trying to talk to a friend about bitcoin yesterday and his simple question left me in disarray: **Why use bitcoins? What can it do that CC can't do right now?** I tried to explain about the transaction fees and the fact that it is not run by criminal institutions, but I couldn't convince him because I was lost myself.
You seem to be a really eloquent guy so I would really appreciate an honest answer that a new person could understand. Yes, achieving consensus over distributed nodes is a revolutionary idea, but that won't cut it with new people (especially since we are yet to see the killer 'apps' that will use the blockchain).

My question is about Electrum, which has the ability to generate different addresses from a single seed.
First, is there a limit to how many unique addresses can be generated with a seed? If not, when I restore my Electrum wallet would it need to run through countless addresses to check for transactions?
Second, is there any way you can relate different addresses generated by the same seed? i.e. if I give you 5 addresses, can you tell me whether they came from the seed or not?
@_date: 2015-01-04 11:47:37
You are absolutely right. The problem is that in most countries the Govt. has no policy in bitcoin. But the laws are such that they'll come after you if someone launders money using your exchange.
Thus, to protect themselves the exchanges go *farther than the banks* to verify their customers. No easy solution until bitcoin reaches the tipping point where it is no longer possible to ignore.
Hasn't Paypal refused pointblank to work with bitcoin exchanges? Due to chargebacks?
@_date: 2015-01-19 14:06:39
 &gt; The only difference would be that the miners would adjust how much they spend on their mining hardware to maximize profits, given their current income from mining vs their electricity costs.
So the hashrate would go down. The system would still work by adjusting difficulty, right? But the network becomes less secure. So we'll increase the tx fees to incentivize the miners.

The miners have only expressed support for 2MB so a 4MB patch would be suicidal. It will be based on 11 and as I said it will certainly predate SW; infact the present fork activation date is set as March 1 (likely to be changed ofc). They'll certainly have to make decisions about including SW/RBF etc. but that lies far in the future for now.

Well they're making quick progress on their Github page and a release is possible in the next couple of weeks.
Yes, it's clearly defined. ATM they're only concerned with releasing a one-time 2MB patch. The process by which future governing decisions will be made is still being fleshed out.
They're simply trying to avoid another XT by having a clear dialogue with the miners beforehand.
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:29:26
- Make sure the wallet's encrypted. 
- You basically run a node to stake. IDT there are any hardware nodes for alts. That leaves either-
a) Buy a used laptop and run the wallet 24/7.
b) Set up a VPS node.
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:09:15


No that's outdated. The most recent census was done by jtoomin. If that were true miners would be running XT. They're suddenly not happy with 8 MB.


Everyone knows miners can set their own soft-limit so I don't see the need to mention that explicitly.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:48:55
It's probably one of the top three arguments thrown around for the last 2 years since a contentious hard fork was proposed. It is well known that an economic majority has an equally important role in the outcome of a fork. Miners with/without the majority hashrate will NEVER fork unless assured of some degree of support from exchanges and services.
In short you don't need to take this on EL's authority. It has been discussed ad nauseam since day 1.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:40:48
It's not a "hilarious solution" to hide it, it's the norm for an exploitable critical bug. Satoshi did this too with his early releases. Obviously the question remains as to why such a bug made it into a release in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:19:23
Yes, but I wouldn't call it a debate back then. The 2010 part of the thread dies out after Satoshi comments that such a change could easily be made in the future. The thread is then picked up two years later, in early 2013.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:44:13
First, I am assuming that they would be willing to take a short-term loss to secure a favorable future outcome. Second, they don't have to use all of their hashrate on the minority chain. If a fork is planned just after the difficulty adjustment, the situation will already be dire. Your third point is valid, under the assumption that users would be willing to pay high fees on the minority chain, rather than simply switching to the other chain. 
Lastly, please relax. You're not as smart as you think you are.

You would have won the misinformation/shitpost argument a month ago. Not today. Let's look at this sub's front page:
- "Expect a violent attack"
- Lie about how Armory is against BU
- btc is a front to pump alts
- Rizun's "propaganda"
- Is the old Jeff Garzik still alive somewhere?
- Talk of BTU tokens without any understanding of the asymmetric situation
- "The multi-million dollar attack will fail"
So what I see is that this sub will allow "half truths and outright falsehoods" as long as it supports their agenda. I don't see why Roger's complaint in this regard strikes you as "cringeworthy" since this debate is all about who gets to have a voice in bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:21:13
True, but as far as empty blocks go, Antpool and F2pool found nearly equal number in February.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:26:09
Always? He signed the HK consensus. SegWit + HF *is* the HK consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:22:18
How? You're at 30% and Antpool can add about 20%.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:13:47
People have short memories. Core devs were warned by community members for months that their proposal had limited support among miners and certainly not the sort of 95% overwhelming consensus that they expected.
This was ignored, like all other public feedback. I remember a comment by Greg Maxwell with the defense that miners had told him privately that they supported SW.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:00:11
BU has less than 20% miner support. Stop blaming them for blocking SW until Core-a coin gets 80% support.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:10:48
Alarmist and unnecessary. Breadwallet's seed can be imported into other wallets like Multibit HD. You don't need to "move" your coins. In the event of a fork it is not a good idea to move your coins anyway, regardless of the chain your wallet supports.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:14:44
Yes, their average blocksize is lower by about 80-100 KB but as far as empty blocks go, Antpool mined 16 and f2pool 12. [Data from Bitfury](

Because they were full of themselves, thinking that the miners would support the massive increase they were asking for. Well the miners heeded your advice and refused and now everyone is back at the table.
They're extending a hand. You know full well that the risks of a hardfork to 2MB are not that great and will be survivable in the worst of scenarios.

I don't speak German but even I can tell that the 3% figure is absolutely false. It only covers the "extremists" who are totally opposed to Segwit. If you insist on that definition you then can't label the hardfork+Segwit supporters as Segwit supporters.

BU is not the way forward but it's an act of desperation. Bruce Fenton said it best. First Core supporters ask Roger and others to fuck off and develop their own client, then try to block discussion around it so that the situation becomes even worse. When all fails it's back to the primal, "It's an attack!!! We must save our community!"

Wasn't some Chinese miner quoted as saying that they had plenty of funds to attack the minority chain after a fork? I'm on mobile so can't link to it right now. I take that to mean that they will somehow buy hashrate or deploy outdated mining equipment to attack the other chain with.

Seriously though, why spread misinformation? It's one thing to say that Jihan Wu is hugely influential in the Chinese community and quite another to allege that he controls all these pools.
Also, I'm not sure if you realize this, but Jihan actively engages with the Core community. In sharp contrast to miners like ViaBTC which are rabidly anti-Core.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:08:44
If you want a truly decentralized bitcoin, you have to live with people trying to change the rules. Why is this so hard to understand? No, it's not as simple as creating an altcoin. Altcoins or alt chains like testnet serve well when testing technical changes, providing a controlled environment and allowing one to judge the results objectively. You cannot use them to demonstrate adverse effects of subtle shifts in economic policy which take effect long-term. Because you can't summon economic participants at your will.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:45:41
Desperation. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 08:24:04
Honestly makes no sense to me.
How difficult/costly is it to start full nodes? Once you have a *sufficient* number of nodes, it shouldn't matter whether they are the majority or not, and the control shifts to the miners and the version of Bitcoin they support. Non-mining nodes have little say if any.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:09:24
This is a classic straw man argument. No one in their right mind would disagree with the assertion that the present team has made immense contributions to Bitcoin. But in the present bid for control over Bitcoin it is important to remember that users rule supreme.
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:37:46
? We could've created a bailout fork too. We knew a few of the main addresses that the funds had been moved to. The devs and the community were smart enough to not fall prey to emotion. If the said altcoin does decide to fork, that'd be a sad day for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:18:53

@_date: 2016-06-22 15:00:52
Intentionally misleading indeed. SPV mining means blocks can never be 100% full.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:47:36
I disagree. Take something like online gambling, for example. Since most services practice instant settlement, use of an altcoin is low-risk for the user. Now if the exchange he buys/sells bitcoin on also supports altcoins, that incentivizes the user to deal entirely in that altcoin, saving significant fees and headache.
A lot of people have suggested that they don't want such users on the bitcoin main chain, and that's fine with me. But what that entails is that bitcoin will lose such users, long before payment channels and the like come into play.
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:00:19
The problem with such arguments is that they assume bitcoin to be the sole cryptocurrency in the world. If we get the balance wrong, we lose users to other competitors. Already, most VC-funded bitcoin companies that were rallying for an increase are implementing altcoin payments. The biggest recent example being Coinbase.
I want bitcoin to be a secure and useful network, not some rube-goldberg contraption that technically-minded folks can feel happy about.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:04:37

I did read the post, and he takes great care to separate his personal position from the project's position. In short, Armory will help users in the immediate fork period but they have no plans to support BU long term. Similar to Electrum's position. So a post title like "Armory does not support any controversial hard forks such as Bitcoin Unlimited", from my point of view at least, is a lie.
There are also minor caveats, like if you read the PR, the dev says: "if someone forks the repo, implements support for it and PRs that back to me, I will at least review the change set. If it's good and segregated, I will merge it."
@_date: 2016-06-09 11:31:43
Yes, but it will be very inconvenient. Depending on how many transactions you've made recently, Electrum will take some time (5-20 minutes) to recover your wallet.

I disagree regarding hard drive space. You can buy a 2TB HDD for the price of a hardware wallet. Chain grows at 1 * 6* 24 * 30 * 12 = 50 GB / year. Even if the blocksize limit was raised to 2MB, the HDD would last a lifetime.

I'm sorry but Andreas is wrong about India on many counts. 


One statistic he didn't mention is that only about 2-3% of the Indian population pays their taxes. Businesses don't keep a proper record of cash transactions and thus never pay, or best underpay their taxes. So the options are-
a) Hypnotize nearly a billion people into paying their taxes.
b) Force these transactions through banks so a record is kept.


About 80 so far. We're about to hit the one month mark in a couple of days.


The trading volume doesn't agree. All the proper Indian exchanges have ID requirements anyway. The only exception is localbitcoins, and if you're willing to do an off-the-records cash transaction in the present climate, you're an idiot.

Matt was invited by Roger to a conference 4 years ago. He was trying to develop a rudimentary version of the LN and was asking for more support (he specifically mentions BCI.info). He then says that there is a great sense of urgency among the devs to scale bitcoin, and that there is a lack of communication which may give appearances to the contrary.
I don't see much of an argument here to justify OP's sensational claims.

The entire thing had to be kept a secret, even from the banks, or it would have turned into a sham. No surprise then that the banks are ill-prepared. But things are nowhere near as bad as the media makes them out to be.

I can tell you about why Bitcoin will help the developing world.
As someone who lived in Africa for years, I can tell you that the banking system there, even for intra-country banking services, is truly atrocious.  Most people are unbanked there because of the local banks' untrustworthiness, low quality service, and inaccessibility.
For instance, it is not unusual to have to wait in line for 2 hours to withdraw money.  I was literally refused the right to cancel my own bank account, face-to-face, until I made a massive ruckus and demanded to see the manager. 
Let me emphasize that, in many African countries, there is a total failure of national institutions due to corruption and incompetence.  Since bitcoin makes you your own bank, many of the institutional deficiencies in developing countries could be short-circuited.  Many of the services in Africa that work best do so because of market forces and individual entrepreneurialism: in the teeth of rent-seeking government officials.
In addition to its role in liberating users from entrenched local institutions, Bitcoin also has enormous potential in cross border money transfers.  Sending money internationally, right now, is criminally expensive and slow.  You can pay a massive fraction of your total to send money abroad.  This amounts to many billions of dollars a year in fees to money transmitters like Western Union.  It is also noteworthy that these revenues, every year, are many multiples of Bitcoin's current market cap.
Besides the cheaper transmission costs, Bitcoin also delivers in that it allows an escape for people behind dictatorial currency control regimes.  This is hard to imagine from the USA, but in many countries, currency movements are closely controlled and regulated.  Whereas market forces may dictate a certain exchange rate, many governments simply enforce, with guns, another one.  This leads to massive inefficiencies.  Since bitcoin transcends all borders, it threatens governments' abilities to restrict the free flow of currency. 
These problems, corruption, lack of property rights and banking, currency manipulation, and illiquid money, are many of the factors holding back the developing world.

Bitpay is against UASFs.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:07:08
I will concede that you never directly alleged that Bitmain was running this stuff on mainnet. But your supporters did all the work for you. The end result is the same - widespread belief that Bitmain is using Asicboost without an iota of evidence.
Merely mining empty blocks doesn't count as evidence when others like f2pool do it nearly as often.
As for why I support the extension blocks proposal over segwit, I will leave you guessing since your cleverly crafted words imply malice on my part. It has something to do with how Core doesn't give a flying fuck about the opinions of the users, businesses and miners who use their software. This is the best I can come up with without assuming malice on your part. 
And Bitmain called you out on your assertion that Asicboost was the reason for not supporting Segwit. Unsurprisingly they still stand by the HK consensus which does include segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:57:12
The reason there is a no HF promotion policy is because it can lead to a chain split. So can a UASF.
In other words, the problem is not with the aim (blocksize increase) but with the method used to deliver it (HF). The same is true of UASFs.  
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:29:12

Fine, smeared by the broader community (including devs like Peter Todd and Bram Cohen). But Maxwell's reputation is the reason most people took it so seriously in the first place. Led the lamb to slaughter...
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:11:05
So a company was just smeared for committing no crime. Good days in bitcoin.
And most of that data is meaningless -
1) Bitfury actively experiments with including the max. number of transactions in a block, just as they will mine very low-fee txns that combine lots of UTXOs.
2) f2pool mines nearly the same number of empty blocks as Antpool. 
3) Four blocks with a small number of transactions but the same coinbase string proves nothing.

Classic deflection. Still waiting for Maxwell's proof.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:43:20
And back to 8% as per litecoinpool.org. 
Also if you look at the total hashrate it appears to decrease i.e. now at 2727 GH/s from 2865 and 2789 GH/s. Looks like variance.
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:14:11
Bcoin (developer of EBs) has already patched asicboost. And Segwit does not prevent the use of asicboost entirely.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:31:50


Maxwell's own words:
When asked how the vulnerability can be verified, and if it can simply be seen by examining a block, Maxwell stated that the network needs to be watch for behavioral patterns. “The covert method is hard to detect and cannot be detected on a block by block basis. It can show up as an increased number of empty blocks, strange ordering of transactions in blocks, or never-seen-before transactions showing up in blocks.”
Maxwell needs to put his analysis out there or this will be seen as a smear attack on a political opponent.
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:14:53
They've said so publicly, so please explain yourself.

Both parties involved in the debate have conflicts of interest. Coinbase relies on the continued expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem to stay afloat. Restricting network growth at a critical time in Bitcoin's history is not the best idea. Yes Bitcoin must rely on second layer solutions eventually but there is no need for them now. So even if Coinbase is purely selfish, they're merely trying to help Bitcoin the way they see fit.

False. As long as they provide access to both chains, there are no regulatory requirements that single out the Core chain as being "bitcoin". Especially if they choose the chain with the majority hashrate.

Hello, average person here. There is a logical fallacy in your argument. The Internet/Computers/TVs etc. could do stuff that had never been done in history before. Where is Bitcoin's original app?
If its currency, then bad luck, I've been conducting financial transactions on the Internet for several years using something called a "credit card". So, Bitcoin ATM is nothing more than a niche currency and there is no reason to see why it'll suddenly appeal to everyone in the next decade.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:20:51

In the long-term, yes. When it comes to short-term capacity increases though, this is absolutely political. I remember salty comments from many prominent devs here when pools began raising the soft limit from 750Kb to 1Mb. Suddenly it's absolutely normal to have 1Mb blocks. Also the planned soft fork only raises the limit to about 1.8 Mb. Several people have calculated that payment channels used by a much larger number of users would require a significantly larger main chain blocksize anyway.

If that doesn't work:
1. **Backup your wallet** in multiple places. Check Google for help if needed.
2. Install Electrum.
3. From MultiBit, export your private keys. It will save them as filename.key. Change the extension to .txt and make sure you can access the priv key. Ignore the instructions in the txt, just copy the priv key.
4. In Electrum, go to Wallet -&gt; Priv keys -&gt; Import. Paste the key you copied there.
If all goes well, Electrum should show your balance.
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:53:55
Okay, so don't worry you still have your coins. 
The simple way is to just reset the blockchain on Multibit. Go to Tools -&gt; reset blockchain.
If that doesn't work, we'll have to move your private keys (your btc) to another wallet, say Electrum. This requires some carefulness and effort, but will definitely work.

As someone else has already pointed out, it is best to have a coherent policy on the matter before taking any such disturbing decisions.

Their paycheck comes from their users. So they have a strong incentive to ensure that bitcoin succeeds and works as intended.
