As a super newb (only used btc to pay some small time business stuff, not more than 500$ all in all together), does this affect me as normal user in any way? I keep hearing about the halving and always thought that just is something the miners have to worry about.

Bitcoin, the money of the future! 
Hm, looks more like stocks to me.

Thanks for the heads up =). I am mainly interested in using btc for paying stuff, not as an investment option, hehe.

Joe Schmoe doesn't want to worry that his internet money is losing it's worth over night... Bitcoin still has a long way to go :/

Yes, the EU going bankrupt will be of great Benefit for us Europeans.
Wait a minute....

I just use it occasionally for buying stuff online. Usually it is such hassle to get my fiat to bitcoin, and the heavy fluctuations made it worse. 
I want to use it legitimately as a currency, not as a financial investment - but the volatile nature really makes that hard to do.

Will it bring more fluctuations, or more price stability? The last couple days were really good for me, I could buy and sell with btc with almost no price changes. Important for me, since I can't buy it instantly, I always have to wait a bit before I get my btc. (europe btc markets suck :x)

RemindMe! Three weeks. 
Interested in this as well. Not really interested in a crashed EU Market...

As I thought. What again am I shilling?

Thank you for this easy to understand explanation. I like to buy Stuff with Bitcoin, and really only use it as a curency, not as an investment.
For us Fiat-&gt;BTC-&gt;Fiat Users, this really seems to be not of any concern.

Keep Calm my British Friend. It will take quite some time until the negotiations take place, and that things will change. Don't do some hasty stuff you might regret later - keep calm and live on. 
Not suggesting that leaving the country is a bad idea though - just plan it out thoroughly! Keep your head up mate.

Damn, Quit making so much sense Russia! You are supposed to be the bad guy! That is what CNN told me! 
Actually I am surprised that they are so relaxed about this, since the Rubel has some trouble, and Bitcoin must look more and more lucrative for the Russians with some cash.

This volatile behavior is exactly what makes most people see bitcoin as an investment, rather than an actual currency.

Cash to BTC to actually paying with it takes me days. Really wish there would be better ways (without ridiculous fees/charges) here in Germany.
