Which is good enough for me, and should be for everyone. By the way, in case anyone was wondering,

That sounds dangerous

Eh, I won't celebrate until we're at 1776
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:59:19
Will it send the coins to any address or just online? Does it scan qr codes?
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:13:49
Makes it easier to mitigate a vote brigade.
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:53:25
So, they're a currency exchange machine?
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:45:08
Why does everyone seem to be using online wallets instead of their own, and what's the deal with bitcoin ATMs? What do they actually do, if bitcoins are an online thing?

It's a show of good faith and transparency so no one can holler at him over it later.
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:50:13
Oh. They should fix that. I think chrome got rid of it unless you set a special flag, and they plan on getting rid of it completely by the end of the year. I've heard rumor of similar plans for firefox, but I don't know anything hard on that. And speculation has it that IE will only be in Win10 for the corporate versions, otherwise it will be Project Spartan shipped with Win10. Java is on its way out in browser.

I forgot the password to the encrypted file
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:57:02
I don't remember. I think it didn't though.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:48:52
It was [this]( wallet backed up with their "Safety&gt; backup wallet" function
@_date: 2015-08-31 00:12:12
Wear it. If they ask just say you aren't carrying any.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:31:11
I honestly don't know that I trust myself with my coins more than I trust Coinbase.

I bought roughly $12 @ $1k and am holding on to my $120 now. Only gonna go up.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:09:32
Nope. No seed. Just gotta keep guessing, I suppose.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:02:51
I think they do for monetary donations, and try their best for physical donations

Swype capitalized it. I was pointing it out because I thought he meant automatic
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:06:32
So what you're telling me is Orange is the new back?
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:39:45
But bruh. All the best VR porn is paid
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:43:01
I've never been there. What do they have against bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-28 05:14:48
If they pay, what's the problem? Other than the possibility of a chargeback, I suppose. But that's not relevant for this order.
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:39:29
So, I'm sorry to leak here, but if I figure correctly
    Chuck Norris = Nutella
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:52:38
Still the same, it completely bypasses 2-factor. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:11:26
30% is kinda steep
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:40:20
So what you're telling me is, I can use bitcoin to get Neteller money, but not the other way around?
@_date: 2015-03-28 05:47:42
We need bitcoins to defend our bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:57:15
Yeah. I love the dogecoin guys, and I used to be one of them, but then I realized I'm only fooling myself. Dogecoin just doesn't have what it takes to succeed in the real world. They have hopes and dreams but no way to get themselves taken seriously, let alone make progress to leave the internet, or even reddit very well.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:20:57
I received this today with no explanation, after trying to purchase Bitcoin for the first time through Coinbase. I've heard of them doing this when the price rises between the time of submitting the purchase and the purchase completing. Is that what happened here?
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:45:52
I don't understand the aversion to holding your own wallet, especially if you're just doing it quickly as a proxy.
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:25:01
I think they expect you to buy it and use it directly from coinbase
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:59:37
Yeah. To circle it is!
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:54:25
They probably think I'm laundering money through them.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:56:46
So what do I do? Give up and go to circle, or try again?
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:54:19
The pin is too small
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:57:12
I switched to circle, because none of my coinbase ones were going through.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:39:35
It's not. I've sent some coins from coinbase to my phone's wallet, but that's it.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:47:08
Coinbase hasn't let me buy from them since I've been moving all of my bitcoin from coinbase to my phone as soon as I buy it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:26:47
I don't have a 'financial act'. I earn and spend money just like anyone else. I don't have and never have had any debt. I have plenty of money in the account.
@_date: 2015-03-25 05:37:39
I just checked. It isn't
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:38:44
Thanks for that. I have two-factor. Should I take the screenshot down?
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:22:22
Hi. I'm just starting with bitcoin and coinbase and didn't realize this was an issue. How is your standing with Wells Fargo? Do you have this issue with them?
