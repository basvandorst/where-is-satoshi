It exists?

There will always be beneficial motives behind governmental decisions but adoption is adoption right now. I fail to see how this could be interpreted as a bad thing.

What % is he giving you?

FYI- Circle will also do this to you. Closed my account a few weeks ago...

For gambling. Was careless and sent right from circle to nitrogensports. Really sucked because I was a localbitcoin trader and it wiped out my business.

You just took me down the most wild rabbit hole.
coconut fucking
a son fucking his mother for years, consensually
a teenage boy cumming into the corner and eventually began raising cockroaches as his children. 
I just lost 80 minutes of my life.
I’m not kidding. Don’t click the link.

I thought I’d seen its ugly side. Apparently I was still a young grasshopper.

I occasionally think about and hope my old associates from the dnm stashed all their coin while I was busy focused on accumulating cash.
Would have been better off just sitting on my bought btc instead of doing things that I’m not proud of having done. 
Safer, too.

Selling at a “heavy loss” as in cashing out too soon before the real jumps?

My personal favorite was the 50% drop in 24 hours 
I barely touched technology for a week

Hey wow another post shit talking a different coin.
screams insecurity...
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:14:02
Try again pal
Held btc for many years, never owned BCH.
ur just corny

If you don’t understand how bitcoin gained its initial popularity through the markets, you’re clueless.
You’re also right. Silk road does not exist. There are now 10+ other markets that have taken its place with tens of thousands of users daily.
Bitcoin has grown incredibly and its usage is now far beyond all that but we can’t act like it didn’t exist and doesn’t now. 
Yes, it’s used in many other ways today and that’s wonderful.

Sure, do you have some gold you’d like to sell me in exchange for btc? 
Alternatively, my e-commerce shop also accepts several crypto currencies in exchange for hand-crafted goods.

Nah, we’re just having a discussion. Thanks for your contribution.

Fiat can’t anonymously bring that substance to my door, though.
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:41:48
I want a thank you bj!
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:47:24
I agree.
