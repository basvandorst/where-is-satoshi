This isn't a fucking debt card.  I got rly excited and checked out their site - this shit is useless for the average consumer.  I just wish I could seemlessly use my bitcoins at grocery stores, gas stations etc like a real credit / debt card.

Assuming 750k BTC is gone, how is this even going to work?  
It will take years to pay it back if the exchange fees are competitive.  Fees will be high or it will be slower / shitter than coined up.  This whole thing seems like a way to get your own exchange.  Pay goxusers a token amount and wait until we forget about it.
