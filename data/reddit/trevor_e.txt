Exactly why I went to uphold.  It seems like even when you are verified they have a 5 day hold on money though.  Damn I miss circle.  I deposited this at $790.... missed that train a bit. 
I have no problem waiting, I'm not hard up for the cash but the time is a bit ridiculous for most.  I am mostly worried as the 5th will be almost 3 weeks since deposit and not sure if fraud has a window it must be reported within.  Or if this is even fraud seeing I made the deposit?

Well thats a bit of stuff to sift through but concerning at first glance...

Hopefully when they block miners they kill bcash too. Remove that uncertainty and we get a 2for1. 
Honestly I dont think it will matter much either way. Those that mine will setup shop elsewhere. Too much money involved.

Only one exchange stops on the 30th. Okcoin and hububoi have until end of October.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a [non profit]( and [accepts bitcoin donations](  I have the highest regards for their work with the community, maybe they can be added to the list?

Awesome thanks- I skimmed the text a few times and didn't see them, could just be missing it though.

I just setup a bip148 node on a rpi3 with dbcache=50 on a 256gb class 10 microsd card and it took about a month to catch up to live.  Even 2x that will be painful.
Not saying rpi3s should be all our nodes, but the barrier of entry for hardware shouldn't be much higher than that, IMO

I'd have to imagine you could rent rack space in a data center for cheaper than wiring your own. You'd only need a few U and make some kind of rackmount.

Until segwit activates and bitcoin price goes thru the roof and ETH pops due to all the ICO scams being all fake money.

Not very. But I suppose most phones have some type of recovery mode so unless its encrypted if its in someone else's hands its probably too late already.

Still cheaper than renting a house and wiring your own I'd think though..

Why would g20 do anything about it? I think too many countries embrase blockchain in general for that to happen.
