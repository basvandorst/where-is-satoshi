Our black tea is high quality, in Myanmar it is traditional to ground the tea, this does not affect quality, just concentration. With grounded tea it you need less of it to achieve the same flavor. We have reviews of the tea up on steepster.com if you are still worried. It is normal! :)

Have fun! :)

strawman: exxagerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument.
in reference to
"Yeah I don't make sense, I didn't want to"
I never said that, and I certainly didn't imply it. I just said that I reacted emotionally, not logically.

As far as I know, we are the FIRST tea store in the world that accepts bitcoin, we're really proud of the fact! :)

What privacy reasons would a business care about? A business doesn't want to be concerned with it's privacy -- that'd make people fishy.

Both are ways to pay for things. Its really as simple as that.

we pay 2% to process credit cards. 2% of $7.0 is $0.14.
shut up yo

We have black tea too! 
And we also ship to certain countries outside the U.S (Canada/UK mainly)

Hey! My store just started accepting bitcoin, if you happent o be looking for green tea, [check it out!]( 
Otherwise,  has great resources for this :) 
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:30:09
I added the bitcoin logo. :) 
And thank you very much! I designed it myself and put a lot of work into it. :)
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:52:09
We do currently ship to canada, and I'm going to get on putting the logo for accepting BTC up ASAP. :)

Now you're using a strawman. See how frustrating it is? 
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:30:52
No, our tea has no chance of being processed with anything like nuts.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:57:22
meanwhile "average bitcoin users" are the all knowing gods

I'm responding emotionally, not logically, heh

Thanks :) 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:27:55
Not yet, we're working on it!
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:32:21
Sorry about that, didn't mean to mislead you. 
- We've got no token sale to peddle
- We've built paybear. It's already fully functional. (more coming)
- We're charging $0 for it during our beta
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:18:14
We use no [gradients]( anywhere on our site. It's against our brand guidelines.
After doing some more research on you - I fully understand why you'd want to badmouth our product. We compete with what you're working on. Best of luck to you and your team, in the end we're all working towards making payments easier.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:50:48
Not yet, we're chatting with them to get shopify integration supported.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:28:35
We haven't figured out our pricing model here. We'll likely be charging a flat fee per transactions per month. We won't be charging a traditional transaction fee like most payment processors. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:55:11
This one hurts a little - we're quite proud of our branding.
Colors: How many fintech companies can you name that _don't_ use blue as their accent/primary color? 
Landing Page: We're flattered, but [our landing page]( looks nothing like [Stripe's]( 
Logo: No similarities at all. [Us]( vs [Stripe](
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:25:50
Yep, imagine your local mom and pop shop trying to figure out the blockchain. Much easier to offer a packaged solution. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:23:44
Thanks! I agree, current transactions times aren't ideal for small ticket purchases. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:26:20
We're aware of this, and working toward a rebrand. :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:27:35
Totally agree. ICO's mostly suck. This is why we didn't rush for an ICO, raise millions then outsource the project. We built paybear to prove that we're serious about making an impact on this space. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:25:07
Absolutely, it's in our roadmap.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:21:51
Here's 4 reasons that come to mind:
1. Merchants need to be able to accept payments without babysitting their wallets and making sure a transaction went through. Having a business wait on an employee to confirm every transaction isn't ideal. 
2. It's easier to download a plugin, add your api key and have a fully working solution ready to go instead of diving into code within your ecommerce/SaaS checkout flow. 
4. A payment form smooths out the purchasing experience. This is more user friendly to nontechnical merchants vs just presenting a wallet address. 
4. What if that intermediary also allows you to accept 6 other cryptocurrencies in the same package? What if they allow you to export your transactions right to Quickbooks? The cohesive featureset becomes attractive to merchants.

My mistake on the logo and the animation, I was looking at the design of the paybear website itself. This would be a silly thing to _intentionally lie about_ from our side. 
I don't disagree, we resemble stripe. So do the majority of fintech companies. We can agree to disagree. I think saying we're _pretty much identical_ to stripe is incorrect.
Our team is just trying to build a useful, usable product to increase Bitcoin's merchant adoption. :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:25:28
We seriously considered doing an ICO... but then we just built and launched paybear instead.
We didn't feel like forcing a token model into a business it didn't belong in. :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:23:54
Thanks! That's very flattering :) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:44:06
This'll depend on the blockchain, didn't mean to imply this would be the case for bitcoin. Will let our front end team know. :)
