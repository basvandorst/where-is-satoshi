I mostly pay my utility bills in hundreds.
Dinner for 2 at a restaurant with a $50
Movies with a $20
Street hookers for a bj with a $10
Tip my lap dance entertainer with $5
Snort coke with $2
And tip the pole dancer with $1
I must be doing it backwards, or the fucker at the utility office is getting too many high priced hookers and blow.
And for everything else there's master card.

I prefer the girls who like to be paid in "diamonds", at least those are minable.

There is an escort agency that accepts btc, you can find the ads on BP, if you search Bitcoin
There was a strip club that was going to start accepting btc, but they changed owners.

I'll do some "field" testing.
Will stream to cam4btc, that way its porn, and legal.
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:25:25
Bitcoin accepted here.

Don't forget to make a separate version for guys and girls.
The version for guys will include the option to pay mbtc to "undelete" the picture. Or to voyeur view names that have not shared with them.  Keep the btc for yourself, send 10% to me.

But they can use an iPhone and Instagram.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:05:32
They have ads posted and sponsored and posted daily, monthly, or for up to a year.
i'm guessing many pay for a week to month at a time.  so things should start to get interesting next week.

It's been about a month since backpage stopped accepting cc for escort ads.
Lots of ~~hookers~~ escorts ads are expiring, and they need bitcoin to upgrade to have their ad seen.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:05:22
Ads are free, and they will get flooded.
sponsored ads need to be paid for.  the pros will want their ad up at the top, and highlighted on the side.

I'm a giggolo, not in DC, but I might visit within a year or so.  I inform most customers of bitcoin.  A few have been interested, but non have paid in btc.

It depends on the device you use.
multibit is probably a good one for desktop for you.
android mycelium
iphone bread wallet.
also blockchain.info is a web wallet and useable from phone or desktop.  you are not it full control of the private key.  with the others you are.
start with those, see if you like it. if not try something else.  most of the people active on here probably like to play with everything.  but most people just want something to work.
after the wallet you will also need an exchange, unless you live in silicon valley and have many places to spend your coins.
You could use an exchange to cash out your coins, but at some point they might block your account.  mycelium might help you find a local person to exchange for cash, or localbitcoins.com

Usually a $5 fee to buy a prepaid gift card.
Or get a refillable card. But that's not anon, and you need to wait for them to ship you one with your name printed on it for some of the features.
Some banks let you make a temporary online cc you can set an expiration date, and spending limit.  I have done this a few times to expire next month, and have a $10 limit.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:34:54
you can back up the device.
but you could also have a wallet on a computer at home.  copy the address to your phone. or print it out with a qr code.  you'll have the account available, but cant access it till you get home.  after you use it, its best to make a new address, for your privacy, and your customer's.

Coinbase knows how to tell the difference.
They can tell from the first few numbers.
Not sure if what the porn sites use can tell the difference though.

There was a service.  Bit bucket or something like that.  You would still have to chose to send your years worth (any anything you wanted to program it to do) of bitcoin there, then it would auto pay monthly.. Not sure if it adjusted with the exchange rate.  You could also withdraw your funds anytime in the middle I think.

Good way to figure out what sites do that shit.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:47:13
Take a look at and they have some guides, advice, and you could make a little extra with some pics/vid/underwear sales. you can reveal as much or as little as you like.

I used a temporary card my bank lets me set up for online use.
I can set the card limit and expiration date.  So $10 limit and it expires next month.
Didn't feel like going to a store to buy a card just for porn.  Gf has no need to see my cc statement, and if she did, she better not have a problem with my porn spending... Unless I start spending $10k on it she better try to help/protect me from something sick like that.

I noticed you said you would install Mycelium.  not sure if you've played with it yet.
there is a local trader feature.  if you have 2 devices you could try it with yourself.
you'll need to have some bitcoin already on one of them.
set up a trade with yourself (one of the devices will have a publicly visible ad).
when you finalize the trade you will see a "Network Propagation" status bar, that gives the Probability the transaction will go through.  It usually takes a few seconds.  Once the transaction is included in a block (on average 10min), Its yours to spend.  I'm happy once the status bar reaches 99%, and for many trades have left the person at that.
I don't know of any other sites or software that show the propagation like this. I would like to know of any.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:41:42
there are many options.
you could use a phone you keep with you, and a computer you keep at home.

i'm tired of seeing Black on White anal/bj.  and would pay to see some regular sex.
