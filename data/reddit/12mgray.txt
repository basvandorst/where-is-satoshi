FYI:

Not the opinion of plenty of people on Reddit.

Fortunately as a journalist my info is drawn from conversations with fund managers looking at jumping in. Not hope on my part. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:58:20
Your estimate is what makes a horse race.

Most funds have an Alt-investment arm. This is where these managers place BTC. They don't need investor approval on day-to-day to buy BTC. They will mention it in their quarterly investment letter. It's the same as buying gold. It's also an alt-investment.

Part of my real job is to speak with market participants on what they are doing. I did not name the funds because my conversations are on background with these managers.

Some profit taking from early investors but majority is late investors cutting losses.

Futures trading will tamper the large price spikes. That's what the headline says
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:52:06
By what metric was it obvious? That's what I'm saying. It's not correlated to currency markets or stock markets with any degree of stickiness.

There have been plenty of short-term pullbacks, but on longer horizon the returns are impressive. Prices have been hit this AM on news out of Russia. 
Just wait for Asia to come online again, to see price appreciation.

That was my take as well, but could not confirm. My other thought was that it may be a fund manager or firm-wide buying across multiple trading desks.

No I thought that money (in the trillions now) would or could find bitcoin as a safe harbor to park money there. That was the premise.

Dow loses 460 pts om top of the 666pts on Friday. You still think I'm wrong on stocks sell off?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:50:55
Go for it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:33:54
Roughly $700B came out of the Dow on Friday. Where did it go?
Not much in bitcoin. That's the premise of the article.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:00:12
I agree with all that. However, right now should be the time for some investors to park assets in BTC as an inflation hedge. The usual investment is precious metal to hedge and they have risen of late.
BTC could fill that order as well, but it isn't and that's what I am writing on.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:37:03
Ok I get its democratization (small d) angle and I do agree in the future blockchain will give a lift up to many around the globe.
But right now the unbanked have little chance to buy cryptos. And BTC is priced in dollars (and other currencies) so for traders and investors it's a good hedging mechanism.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:17:13
Look at the global exchanges since Friday. Dow down 666 pts on Fri. Down another 260 pts on the futures. Europe down harder palying catch up.
Try to keep up with the news.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:50:55
Go for it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:59
Not Friday's $700B.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:23:12
I would suggest holding on tight for the first couple of  days. lol

Ticker symbol: GLD. The largest ETF
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:15
Ok I'll come back to this thread on thurs. The Dow is already down 9.7% from last Thursday's close. I write useful information before it happens, not reflexive after it happens.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:48:14
Absolutely. I agree with you. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:20:40
It comes from 2008 when I started this blog
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:41:28
Noted it's not an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:21:26
Have every right to call it BS. But the price move is undeniable.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:57:54
I apologize for assuming more astute investment-grade readers on this forum.
When you have an ETF -- or paper contracts that will far exceed the number of bitcoins in circulation -- the ETF can short the BTC price or sell off the contracts without ever buying the underlining commodity, in this case BTC.
Both these actions will drive the price of BTC down as we have seen for the last 10 years in gold and silver prices.
As with all ETFs on commodities, the contract can be settled in US dollars. So there is no reason for the ETF to load up on BTC. It is a derivative product on the price only.
  
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:33:08
Gold and silver are taken down in price in the paper market. No such mechanism with BTC until they get the ETF. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:01:48
No that would defeat the hedge. Right now it is pure bet the dollar will fall and bitcoin denominated in dollars will rise.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:46:42
I agree. If it doesn't come from within regulators will come knocking. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:11:54
Very true $300 takedown right after my post. But as I said in the post give it time. 
Strong fundamentals showed a quick rebound back
