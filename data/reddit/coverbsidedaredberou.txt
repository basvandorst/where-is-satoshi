Too much demand, they have to think how to deliver a lot of coins and still have some left for themselves. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:25:07

@_date: 2017-05-27 06:32:52
makes sense
 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:52:02
Worry not, btc is back on the game, was just a scare directed to the weak hands.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:37:52
What about fees? They grow exponentially at higher values, maybe a little discrepancy between exchanges cannot guarantee ill get enough coins back.
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:54:13

Offer and demand.
Yeah you could, but the time it would take to move to another place makes the outcome unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:40:23
