I think you may be referring to in-browser security. What we're dealing with is extensions which are much more secure and much closer to desktop applications.

Both will be debuting in Toronto tonight! Check out [here]( for more details.

After all the record keeping and FinTrac compliance, MAYBE banks will allow Canadian Bitcoin companies to have accounts now. Could this be a silver lining in all this?
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:20:33
Sweet!

Ripped down the hanging sign? Decentral moved, there is no hanging sign at the new location, but there is a big Bitcoin sign there and a Bitcoin ATM that serves hundreds of customers a week. Decentral also holds Bitcoin 101 sessions and has staff that sets up walk-ins with Bitcoin wallets. I don't think its fair to say Anthony has abandoned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:38:31
I'm not sure who Bitconnect is.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:39:47
Competition in this space is always welcome. Whatever needs to be done to get more BTC in the hands of the people..
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:31:34
You would be wrong sir!
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:26:04
Now just listing cities without and supporting info isn't very fun....put some oomph into it.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:21:40
Now now Mr. King. My Spidey sense tells me you may be holding off on some exciting "details" as well. wink wink. However, I may be wrong..
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:57:36
Its not a Bank of Canada logo.
It says "Made in Canada" and of course the French equivalent "Fabriqué au Canada".
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:29:06
You should be able to purchase one soon. It is not setup with the interac network.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:26:15
Nope. Never had Asian food in Ottawa.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:42:47
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:24:42
How about we rule out BC. I'll give you that.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:25:29
They most certainly are cheaper!! I can't say how much though as the team still has to make some key decisions.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:21:40
Awesome! They just made clear what we've heard rumored for a while. This gives our Canadian BTC businesses confidence they're in compliance. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:22:03
It exchanges fiat for BTC and in some cases BTC for fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:24:08
It isn't Dundas Square Toronto.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:28:18
Not necessarily...
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:22:53
Not necessarily...
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:14:02
Completely disagree.  With your thinking ANY bitcoin Web wallet or banking system is not secure and millions use such services.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:51:05
I really can't right now. Sorry.  More info will come out soon.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:30:44
Woot Woot!
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:53:47
The company name is still TBD. It's Canadian made by a fantastic team that came together and hammered this out in very very short time. Like a couple weeks. They graciously reached out to me and offered me their first machine. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:44:32
This will not be the location for the BTM. I commend your detective skills however. [The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada]( is a national non- profit whos offices will be moving from that mentioned address very shortly...
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:54:36
Thanks! Super excited.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:27:04
No problem! It is a little tricky to make out.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:33:21
We do not ask you to feel any particular way. The machines will be placed in a location with dedicated staff to handle any issues that may arise. Also, the people involved are well known in the Canadian BTC community. That being said, trust in this venture has to be earned and that is our goal. As soon as more details are released a lot more will be understood. For now I'm just showcasing a Christmas present.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:28:24
Because this is part of a much bigger picture, and that announcement will happen very soon. Its just not the right time now. The fact of the matter this machine will help facilitate Bitcoin purchasing in Canada. Isn't that enough for you.?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:53:53
Please elaborate on your statement.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:15:31
Well it does say both "Made in Canada" and "Fabriqué au Canada" on the sticker.

Bitcoin Decentral is a 5500 square foot 4 floor Coworking space in the heart of downtown Toronto. It will provide space for the [Bitcoin Alliance of Canada]( [KryptoKit]( [Cointalk.ca]( [Ethereum]( [The Toronto Bitcoin Meetup]( [The Bitcoin Expo 2014: In Cryptography We Trust]( and other disruptive technology innovation initiatives and businesses that desire to be immersed in a space with people of like-minds dedicated to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
If you're in Toronto on January 1st, please drop by between 7pm and 10pm and witness the unveiling of Toronto's first ATM and the first Bitcoin ATM made in Canada, and a new home for Bitcoin in Toronto. 
Check [here]( for details and location.

Please have patience. There are many other factors involved with this and I'm ensuring its being handled properly.There will be some announcements soon, and the ATM is just part of the larger picture.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:36:24
lol. It would freeze and not work :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:44:38
Wow. On the first day the BAC received over 200 emails, 25 Volunteer signups, 75 new members, 10 Lifetime paid members, and 2 yearly paid members. Been a rockin' day, thanks for the support!
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:18:20
Details will follow with a subsequent announcement shortly. This is just the tip of the iceberg for some very exciting new Canadian happenings. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:02:28
Very nice try. But those are not the clues that would give away the location.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:16:41
This one dispenses BTC only. It will be retrofitted within 2 weeks to enable both buying and selling. This team moves very quickly.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:20:33
You are wrong sir!
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:48:07
Finally. A national news article that puts the benefit of Bitcoin front and center. Great job Jesse!
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:47:19
Thanks!! It will open for business in a major city in Canada. Look for a clue on the machine and see if you can figure out which one. :)
The exact location has been secured and will be announced shortly. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:43:13
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:40:17
If this machine went both ways would you be bi-curious? :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:30:16
I will made an announcement of further details soon. Just making sure its the right time and a couple t's are crossed and some i's dotted. 
No association to Canadianbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-25 22:39:12
It's for the fingerprint scanner. Which we expect to use on transactions over certain amounts.
