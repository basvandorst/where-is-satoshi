I think we need to be realistic in our expectations. Most people are treating bitcoin as an investment vehicle, not a means of exchanging productivity or currency. If you are hoping the price will reach $2000 next year you are just another one of many speculators. Speculation adds not inherent value. All we can do at this point is support any new businesses / startups that aim to treat bitcoin as currency.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:44:02
I was thinking along the exact same lines as this recently as well. Well said. My friend asked me if Bitcoin had fundamental value, I said yes - the electrical energy and investment required to make it gives it fundamental value. If society starts ditching fiat currency, like you say, the energy value will transfer into the bitcoin.
I also do not believe any of these Altcoins will supplant bitcoin, solely from the fact of how much more energy has already been put into bitcoin. This will continue to increase exponentially.

Agreed. I like ckpool - 0% fees, great for small time miners. Also use Slush, he and his team stand for the same ideals I do.

Miners can mine whatever they wish. If they choose not to optimize their fee's, other miners benefit. Start mining, stop whining.

Another comment purely based on greed. 
If some other coin supplants bitcoin, good for it. Makes no sense to compromise bitcoin's core values because of greed. Bitcoin exists to be censorship resistant, that's it. Increasing blocksize compromises this value proposition, no thanks.

It doesn't matter if the majority of users care, the majority of users are just speculators. What matters is that we don't turn bitcoin into something that governments / corporations / rich miners can censor. This is *all* that matters. Altcoins are here fore a reason, to go play with bad idea's.

They don't "hurt bitcoin", in fact they subsidize miner competition.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:38:00
Everything you said is based on greed. Tell me, what is the rush? We can't increase the blocksize until we at least give LN a chance. The dust that no longer has value may be unlocked when LN is adopted. The same dust may increase in value to the point where the on-chain fee's the market is willing to pay is less than the dust value.
You have BCH to play with if you want bigger blocks, nobody is stopping you from doing so. Why in gods name would I compromise censorship resistance and increase the network burden for future users, when we *don't know* if LN will solve scaling because *we haven't given it a chance*.
The WORST thing that can happen due to congestion is people use bitcoin LESS. OK, fine, the value of my BTC goes down. I am willing to risk that. If you're not, go play with fiat.

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:35:07
I think Jihan has good points here. 
Everyone needs to understand and appreciate what miners do for Bitcoin and for PoW. We put an *upwards* pressure on the BTC price. That's right not downwards like some people would think, but *upwards*. A miner will not sell their BTC at a price less than what he paid to get it. A miner takes the biggest risk and thus a miner deserves the biggest reward. I'm spending my time now learning how LN and second layers will affect my transaction reward. I think the community would serve itself best to make it clear how the tx reward will be split up in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:36:32
Right, I understand this. But why are you not mentioning the most important point here, the COST of such an attack? How long do you think the attacker can sustain that kind of hashrate? Are you aware of the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost to energy cost / day? You think the investors would be happy that the attack is not only costing them profits, but is destroying market confidence in both chains, resulting in a price drop? I'm fully awake bud, are you?

I disagree with you on this. Splitting the coin allows the market to decide which coin it favors. Each coin can increase their following accordingly. There is no leadership in bitcoin, no matter how many times split, just influencers. The market will decide which influencers are worth following.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:19:15
Changing the PoW is a fear response. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:08:35
Pure speculation, and fear based. Please elaborate.
You do know an attack is extremely expensive to the attacker right? Especially if our minority chain are holding strong, together. It's a lot harder for a centralized entity, like Antpool, to maintain an expensive attack (investors don't like losing money) while our chain, more decentralized, can more readily defend. It's nothing to me to mine my few ASIC's for months (at a loss), but a completely different story for Bitmain / hypothetical attacker.

Right, they die. I'm talking about not giving into fear and changing the PoW. The second a PoW change is enacted, no miner will trust that chain ever again for fear of getting nuked. I will die defending it before I go mine with some network of cowards.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:55:48
Good point!
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:58:37
My idea would be for each of us, individually as miners, users, speculators and fence-sitters to support the chain they choose. That's it. That's all that is required. I see no problems with two competing chains, in fact I think it is inevitable.
Imagine BTU splits with BTC and BTU has 75% hash, the costs of attacking our chain with 25% of the existing hashrate supporting it (think energy cost). Would be astronomical. Such an attack would not last long at all. And it would be self destructive to the attacker. The best they could hope for is to incite fear and uncertainty, but that would also hurt their own chain. The dust would settle pretty quickly, and individuals could choose which chain to support. Let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:39:11
Here's how we combat this: divide (fork) the chain, and move the fuck on

Do you really think BU will wasted an insane amount of money attacking the BTC chain?

I don't understand. Why couldn't us good, honest, decentralization-first-minded miners and "users" not just wait it out? The storm would blow over quickly. Storms are expensive. We mine on the chain we agree to be valid.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:41:25
I just hope they give us miners time, in such a case of a malicious attack, to attempt to support and defend the chain and see if we can fight it off before forking to a PoW change.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:01:26

@_date: 2017-03-29 00:48:46
You are absolutely right, it's pointless. Too many people on this forum downplay the importance that miners - the people risking their wealth and energy to bring value and stability to Bitcoin - bring to the ecosystem. Miners are more egg than chicken
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:05:58
By changing the algo and eliminating my ASIC's from hashing on your chain, you are also destroying my voting power and ability to support your chain.
Regarding an attack, even if hostile actors or simply fear mongers like Jihad Wu orchestrated one, a sustained attack cannot last long because the attacker will be bleeding money. The more hashrate, the more money.  Both chains will suffer, but eventually the  attackers will exhaust and the dust will settle.  I believe an attack would be short lived.  During that time fear and uncertainty will warn people from transacting due to the risk. Eventually, both chains will evolve and have relative value to each other and to the USD, competition is a good thing - an internet of money.
And I'll throw in a thought that this kind of thinking seems to sprout from fear of miner centralization. Changing the algorithm will not help this problem because it doesn't solve the issue of cheapest electricity wins. If you don't want SHA256 hashing, then you're going to have to throw out PoW altogether.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:40:53
Elaborate on how changing a PoW will keep miner centralization at bay please? You are aware that miner centralization is due to centralization of cheap power right?
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:13:21
Mining isn't just about making profit, it's about supporting a network you believe in. I got into mining because when I learned  about bitcoin 6 month ago, I believed in the opportunities and freedoms it would bring to the world. I learned about mining and how my hashrate represented my vote. So I invested in an ASIC knowing full well I may not pay it off. I disagree with you completely, the most decentralized chain will win and I will continue mining on that chain. Nuking the PoW algo is taking away my right to vote. It's not even an option, let alone one worth talking about. Discussing it is *more* toxic than any of these fear mongering, bull**** threats coming from BU.

Oh I'm definitely on board with LN, but I just want understand how the total fee's are split up for a given channel. Sure the fee/tx is tiny, but what is the total % of fee's paid to channel operator vs what is paid to the miner by the channel operator once the channel is closed?
Is there risk of the early channel operators creating a monopoly on channel use? What competitive elements will be in place for newcomers to compete and host their own channel (not sure of the right terminology here)? 
What are the costs to the channel operator, just bandwidth and running a node?
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:04:03
Guys miner centralization is due to low cost energy, not access to ASIC's. So PoW change happens, you guys boot up your CPU's etc.. meanwhile, greedy bastards with low cost energy build some better gear, push you out, mining centralizes and the cycle repeats.

I think there is a very large political / economic / moral need for a currency to be completely transparant, with individuals and businesses identified in each transaction. This could be used in cases where corruption is inherent (government spending etc).
That being said, there is an equivalent need to have alternative crypto-currencies that are 100% anonymous.
People should have a choice. In certain applications it should be mandated that transactions are all conducted in a 100% transparent blockchain (where addresses are linked to real people / businesses for liability purposes).

This is a terrible idea, you clearly haven't invested any of your own money in mining equipment. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:17:54
You do realize that conducting such an attack, even repeatedly at strategic intervals, would incite fear and pessimism in both chains? 
The attackers would be losing money from their hashrate attacking our chain, and their own chain would not be making them money.
I don't see how such practice could possibly sustain itself. Even Bitmain cannot just burn up all of their investors profits.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:17:20
Right but I meant if that single mining coalition forked off, the minority chain (our chain) would be largely decentralized in comparison. It would be easier to put up a defense because our energy cost is split up between more miners. The attacker would quickly have to give up due to energy costs alone. Eventually the market would choose which chain to support and further attacks would be more difficult and definitely more costly.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:36:27
They will do what's in their best interest, yes. With more competition, they will have less incentive to mine themselves and more incentive to turn over product with a guaranteed margin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:18:23
While you guys are right in saying miners will mine what is profitable, it can be more than that. I for one would not mine on a malicious chain, I would prefer to defend the chain I believe in. Granted, I'm a small timer and it isn't too costly for me to do this, but if there's enough people like me we would make it very expensive to attack our chain.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:25:54
OK, simple as that is it. 
Well I hope that there are competitive drivers in place to prevent any single channel operator from gaining market control / monopoly. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:08:07
The flaw in your argument here is that we wouldn't be mining in the first place at a loss, so we wouldn't be getting new coins to sell at a loss. We only mine new coins if we can sell at a profit, hence *upwards* pressure
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:23:33
Not exactly. Assuming the OP is on target, Jihan can choose to trigger Segwit whenever he wants. Delaying it has the upside the OP suggests, and when Jihan feels like it he will support Segwit and activation will likely follow. The main thing is that Jihan is indeed influenced by the market, so I would think if the market continues to tank he would eventually fold his cards and do what a "rational actor" should do: support his investment.
Edit - I'll also add that since Jihan has likely the lowest overall operating cost for mining, it's not such bad thing for him to suppress the bitcoin price, knock out more competition and yield higher rewards. This tactic also destabilizes the confidence of potential investors looking at starting up their own chip / miner manufacturing outfit.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:06:58
Hey guys, what about the obvious option of DEFENDING the attack!? Jesus so many cowards fearing the unknown and clamoring to change PoW. No one will mine on your new chain, no miner will trust you.

I also agree. Bitcoin doesn't need an ETF. The ETF wouldn't do anything that is quantifiably good for bitcoin, it would just allow more speculators to speculate. So the only people who really care about the ETF are the speculators. If I want to invest my savings plan in BTC I wouldn't put it in this ETF anyway, I would buy BTC.

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:10:32
That's not a fair comparison. Most of the miners who were involved in GPU, CPU, FPGA mining etc made a MINT. I wish I knew about bitcoin back then, I would be retired I am sure. One clear difference is that everyone who invested in GPU's etc were well aware that new technologies were rendering their equipment obsolete and it was an upgrade game. It's a completed different risk to just brick our ASIC's because you are scared.
So lets say PoW is changed. It doesn't change the fact that miner centralization has occurred solely due to centralization of low-cost energy and has nothing to do with Bitmain. How do you solve that? What stops the exact same problem from happening to your new PoW Algo? 
Everyone who are advocating for PoW change need to just calm down and realize one thing. We are very close now to moore's law, new technology upgrades will not occur as fast as before. It will enable more manufacturers to sell the same efficiency chips and decrease Bitmains market share. Getting into the mining game is and will continue to become a more stable option. I firmly believe mining centralization will naturally move away from China as competition heats up. There's more time for us North Americans to get our ASIC's without having them devalue significantly in the time it takes to ship.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:07:45
I agree with everything you say here. Price is certainly not *dictated* by sellers or miners, just saying miners put upward *pressure* on the price. It's all inter-related.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:31:19
Agreed. And the act of mining and consuming energy actually puts an upward pressure on the price, as miners never sell their "gold" less than the energy cost to mine it.

Unfortunately, I'll be buying more Antminer's from Bitmain soon, it's simply the best product today. It hurts to do so, I wish they would at least remain agnostic towards this whole "debate" and not promote talk of malicious attacks... I think Jihan, one way or another, will one day regret taking a side. It's bad business for a manufacturer to do so.
I also hope one day Bitfury will sell a miner to the general public. Honestly, it makes me skeptical if they actually manufacture their own gear.. With Bitmain having a monopoly there should be tons of room for them to take a piece of the profit, assuming they are indeed mining with their own gear.
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:48:03
You fail to realize that me, as the owner of a hydro-electric dam (obviously hypothetical here, I wish I was), will go buy tons of GPU's and mine at a lower cost than you, the home miner. Then, as better equipment comes out, Ill go buy that too, because while I am guaranteed to make a return on my investment, you are not due to you high residential power costs. Once again, centralization will occur. PoW change does shit all. You people fail to understand that those with access to cheap energy will always call the shots in PoW. Our only chance is to pay them to host our gear.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:29:22
Very interesting thanks for this.
I am pro-segwit &amp; lightning, but I hope the channel operators have mechanisms in place preventing them from monopolizing and for them to compete on a free-market. I wouldn't want to mine their coin otherwise.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:00:28
Could you elaborate? If I was aware of the potential of an attacker going after my chain I would indeed be hesitant to transact. But that threat would not last long and the likelihood would decrease with time, due to growing network hashrate of my chain = increased attack cost.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:44:17

@_date: 2017-03-24 14:33:51

@_date: 2017-03-20 15:46:20
2 seems like the only reasonable choice here. If they fork why would we "concede" with  Just keep the two chains and evolve and let market decide. Slower block time for a month or more won't kill anything... changing the PoW algo is a horrid idea and would guarantee the new coin would be a shit alt-coin
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:14:12
My take on it could be that large mining outfits like Antpool could just say a bunch of garbage to create uncertainty and a dip in price, then when the timing is right, they could change their minds and promote Segwit activation. Having this kind of influence means they can decide to buy at the low then flip the tables for a nice profit.

I appreciate that we need to plan for it, but I don't like entertaining talk of a nuclear option like a PoW chain. I don't know how I could continue mining if I felt my equipment and investment could be rendered obsolete at any moment. I happen to be planning to quit my job to mine full time and this talk scares me. It's like the community would be stripping me right to vote. I think there are better contingency plans to discuss, anyway.

Best way to combat fear here on Reddit is to ignore and downvote everything that entertains or credits idea's that fear monger. 
Such an example is increased discussion to change the PoW algo in the face of an attack after a fork. This is an argument solely predicated on fear, with no empirical evidence.

Fair enough. Maybe I am naive but I know there's others like me. I just do not buy into ever having a need to change the PoW. It just scares me, considering I'm about to make another significant investment into Bitmain ASIC's, that respected people in this community like Peter Todd are lending credit to a PoW change. I just don't see it as a viable option, in any situation. And I'm all riled up about it haha.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:53:51
No, we wouldn't be fucked by the attack. That's the assumption PoW-change-advocates are making, but one that isn't valid. First, there's no empirical evidence to support it, just threats. Second, such an attack would be enormously costly for the attackers and therefore would not last very long. The chains evolve, that's it.

The beautiful thing about forking, is it allows two opposing opinions to part ways. Let them go, then support the chain you wish to support. Bitcoin is about free markets, let the free markets work.

So could not the good faith miners of our chain not just mine on the last block that we agree to be valid? As long as we stick together eventually our chain will overcome the attackers chain and become the valid chain. Eventually their resources to continue attacking will fail. 


Personally I don't think this would happen. I certainly would not switch to mine on their chain if I didn't support them or their tactics. In fact I doubt switching to their chain would even be profitable to switch because such tactics would insight fear and a price drop in both chains. I would band together with the community I support.

Let me presume that you aren't, or have ever been, a miner? From a technical perspective, yes you are correct. But miners bring a lot more to this ecosystem than this simple task, we are what makes your Bitcoin valuable. From an economic and value perspective, Miners risk energy to maintain the blockchain and in doing so we put an upward pressure on the Bitcoin price. We bring stability to the Bitcoin price. Miners are users as well and more specifically we are the faction of users that risk the most for Bitcoin. So please don't just brush off the importance of miners like our function is less than others, arguably our function is the most important of any group in this ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:46:47
As a miner myself, but not 100% involved in everything, I didn't know this. This of course concerns me that channel operators, who are not risking their wealth (energy) might take a cut of my hard earned TX fees. Do you know of a good source of information on this? A channel operator should only get a small fraction of the fee, unless they are risking something as substantial as power costs...

Bitfury is a self proclaimed "full-service blockchain technology company" and yet what full services do they offer? None. They sell smoke and mirrors as far as I can tell. They like to make claims of products like the BlockBox and others, yet no where have I seen evidence that these products exist. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't even manufacture their own chips, they probably subcontract Bitmain to stamp their logo on chips and pretend it's theirs. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:34:11
Yeah you are right, but I guess as long as the price continues to rise I will eventually make a return on the cost of electricity (so temporarily mining at a loss in a sense). I also like it because it's fun and it heats my garage :P

Just like to add that if one believes BTC price to continue to rise, it may indeed be profitable to Mine at a loss today. It comes down to how much risk one is is willing to take. I have 1x Antminer S9 and will probably be mining at a loss in about a year. I'll continue to mine though because I believe the BTC price will continue to increase. Eventually, the losses will be too great vs BTC reward and I'll have to stop.

Really good article methinks.
I thought the author was going to elaborate on how a majority of miners who decide to hard fork could conduct a 51% attack on the root network, but maybe I missed it? 
I mean if BU for example hard forked to their own network, that's great isn't it? The users can decide which currency to use. The future is one of many decentralized currencies, not just Bitcoin, so why resist that, it's evolution.
Also, miners should control the direction of any given network because it's the miners who are taking the risk (spending energy = spending wealth).
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:19:44
Wouldn't the BU community just hard for for their own ideals and the Segwit community go the other way? The community and miners then can support who they want to support. I don't see any problem with this approach
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:36:28
Many people have discussed mining bitcoin with solar energy, it is not a new concept. I can't speak of your case, seems like you are using excess energy, but I can say for sure that solar mining does not pay out yet. Maybe in a few decades when more efficient solar panels are invented...
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:36:54
Hydro is used a lot mainly due to overabundance of power and is generally cheap, most mining is probably done on hydro-power right now.
Wind and solar - well these barely pay themselves out in most applications let alone using for mining bitcoin. Fact that they have intermittent productivity hurts the application for bitcoin mining as well.
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:14:34
That probably is the one thing. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:39:19
Bitcoin mining requires a constant supply of power. Power companies, who want to use their power in off-peak times, will not necessary make money on directing their surplus towards mining, as this would only be intermittent. The miners would not me running during peak hours, which would impact their ROI. It may would but the economics are not as simple as you may think.

I don't see the issue with a divided community. It will happen again and again in the future, even if we get past the current debate. All that needs to happen is a hard fork and we can split ways. Sort of an evolution of ideals in a way. I believe this will be inevitable going forward anyway.. the future is many currencies, maybe many branches of Bitcoin.

This article hits the nail on the head, I am so happy to read it I swear I was going to write it myself if I had to.
Inflation, low interest rates and the resultant destruction of wealth of savers results in the need to keep spending, keep investing. This means we must keep consuming, or face wealth destruction.
Consumption is what drives energy demand. If we can get off this BS inflationary currency, which is printed out of thin air and only makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, we can curb energy use and curb climate change.

I do support segwit. Can't say I fully understand it, I don't fully understand much in computer science.. I have only just taken an interest since learning about bitcoin a few months ago. My trust in Segwit stems from reading the plethora of comments from other smarter people who support Segwit on these forums, whose comments make sense to me even if I don't always fully grasp the subject.
But from what I can tell we will need to have a blocksize increase eventually anyway, so why not get it over with now before this debate takes a toll on bitcoin adoption / allows room for other Alts to gain support. 
It does appear to me that certain influencers in this community are on a high horse, they should step off because it appears they are putting their own best interests in front of Bitcoin adoption.

Bitcoin will never have "full adoption" so I'm not down with this post. As the network effect continues it will also increase the need or desire for an alternative coins to take on some of the wealth transfer from fiat to crypto. So I expect the world will use many alts, which may even be Bitcoin clones (i.e. offers the same benefits). Bitcoin may be the ring leader but to think everyone will use it exclusively is silly.

I guess one step further, if the attacker has you at gunpoint at home or something, where time is on his side, he maybe able to coerce you into revealing your cold storage etc.
I don't expect this to be a serious challenge in cryptocurrencies, in the end the risk will typically be higher than the reward.

@_date: 2018-06-15 15:54:31
I know enough about the economics of mining that solar is not competitive with cheap, consistent energy sources like Hydro. If it was, you would see it more. While solar power itself is cheaper, the inconsistent output cannot match the all-in operating cost of Hydro (coal / natural gas in many cases as well), not to mention the electrical infrastructure (farm) required is generally more costly than a typical grid power set up. I'm not trying to hate on solar just being realistic. Chances are this solar company is leveraging unsustainable subsidies if it isn't just a marketing ploy.
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:58:32
OK, fair enough. So what happens we the blocks are *really* full in a year or so, assuming the community is still at an impasse (at least it appears so from my limited perspective) regarding Segwit? Does this mean we will be forced to increase the blocksize as a compromise while we try to gain a consensus on SW or does that mean we have to do a hard fork or something and split ways? 
I don't have the full picture as I still have a lot to learn, but I do worry that bitcoin will be set back or maybe even stunted. I want to see bitcoin succeed.

"Nervous, too, as there's the potential that my trade partner - whom I only know by his bank details - could convince his bank to reverse the transaction, at which point I'm out £620."

@_date: 2018-06-15 16:14:18
It's not about whether it will pay out, it will. Practically all mining farms have paid out, or will. It's a matter of when, and at what opportunity cost. 
For example, if you had 100k to invest in bitcoin, would you invest in a farm that yielded a total of 10 bitcoin or would you buy the bitcoin outright to yield 14?
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:41:19

It seems to me this is a natural evolution of blockchain technology. Let the two compete in the free marketplace, like bitcoin is competing with all of the Alts now. I don't know what the technical restrictions may be for doing this. For one, I am guessing the miners could still use their ASIC's for either chain (could they?) but would have to choose only one.

At $0.065 you should be competitive, as long as no new chips are released within 6 months, which is unlikely. Unfortunately you got milked by Amazon, so it will be quite a while before you break even when you consider how many BTC you could of bought with the same money. But in any case, good luck fellow miner, more people should do what you've done and get into mining.

Unfortunately, the only real option I would recommend to buy right now is Bitmain's equipment. That's what I buy. The Avalon miner is just too costly in terms of $/TH and too inefficient (J/GH) compared to Bitmains product. There is a HUGE market need for a real competitor to Bitmain, hence why I urge the whales to do something about it!
Yes there's plenty of hosting services available. Myrig.com / BitmainWarranty.com is a good option, they are honest people (Note Myrig is the new name for BitmainWarranty /  BitmainWarranty is not owned by Bitmain AFAIK). There are other options out there but I don't have experience with them, so I won't vouch.
Hosting is a good option when your personal power costs are too high (should be $0.10 / kWh to be profitable in the long term).

The problem is that the largest miner who also happens to monopolize ASIC manufacturing does not want to lose their edge - i.e. covert ASICBOOST. That's it. There's nothing else to it.

I'm just saying that bitcoin, or any good, is not "created". It is value transferred from another asset, in this case, typically USD.
USD, like all currency, is just a list of wealth with the person / corp with the most USD in assets at the top. If we trade our USD tokens for a token associated with a different list, maybe Bitcoin, the new list is strengthened (value goes up) the old list is weakened (value decreases).

Personally, while I want to see BTC price grow and grow, it pains me to think of the many individuals who literally just got lucky to be involved in BTC in the early days and are the "whales" of today. Sure they were in early and took a "risk", but lets be real, most of them didn't take much of a risk to justify the ridiculous reward they now have. Right place, right time I guess. Sucks to have only learned about BTC 6 months ago. I sort of wonder if this fact will hinder the growth of BTC in the future, it promotes us latecomers to support some other coin if we can get in early enough.
I'm just jealous...

No, stop this FUD. Core doesn't need to take action. Nobody needs to take action. Bitcoin survived this propaganda attack easily, and will again. These attacks are not sustainable as the miners are inflating the supply of the Alt when they do this. The hodlers of these Alts won't take this behavior for long before they ditch the coin.
Also, while all these miners chased profit on Bcash, they didn't necessarily gain anything. I stuck with Slush during this time and my profitability also increased due to higher fees and a longer difficulty period. If those miners didn't sell their Bcash immediately then the increased profit is much less significant that what they were chasing. 
Lastly, if we assume Bcash has no legs and will fail to continue increasing in price, then these miners are incentivized to sell their BCH for BTC. This further decreases the profits gained from mining BCH, as the sell pressure decreases BCH value and increases BTC value.

The thing about patents as well is that they are not supposed to be used to hold back a technology. For example, if I owned a patent on a flying car but didn't use it and didn't let anyone else use it, the courts would allow others to use the technology as I would be inhibiting progress, they would rule the patent unenforceable.
So in this case, if Bitmain is not practicing their patent and yet are holding back the technology (e.g. blocking segwit / preventing others from using ASICBOOST), I do think the courts would rule that the patent is no longer enforceable.

I'll just comment on your first bullet. I believe the opposite to be true, the higher the electricity cost per CPU the better. We often say the more hashpower on the network the more secure the network. This is true, but assuming all ASICS/mining devices had the same hashing efficiency (hashrate/watt) then one could say the network with the most power consumed Is the most secure. Keep in mind This hypothetical scenario is assuming theres no way to improve mining efficiency. Given two networks with different POW algos, he one with more power consumption should be considered more secure, all other things being equal (like cost of miners, efficiency of miners, access to miners etc). 
This may seem wasteful but electricity has a cost and so it represents a cost an attacker must overcome to attack the network. The cost also stabilizes the coins price as those who've invested in the mining equipment will not sell their coins for a price lower than the cost to acquire. This therefore keeps an upward pressure on the price.
Edit - I sort of misinterpreted your bullet, lol oops. Less electrical consumption per unit cost of the hardware is the same thing as higher hardware cost for a given consumption. Im see you're point, but I'm not sure this would actually help distribute the hardware more. The geographies with lower power costs would still pay off their hardware faster that the disadvantaged geographies.

It's a bit unclear, Bitmain never made a formal statement about the design choices in the T9. But the consensus over at bitcointalk seems to be the T9 is designed so the chips operate more stably than the S9, so reliability is better with the drawback of worst efficiency.

If we assume it takes 30 seconds to validate the block etc, that's 30 seconds of the expected 10 minutes it takes for each new block.  So, by this logic doesn't this correlate to Antpool mining 30/600 = 5% empty blocks (I know this isn't how the probability should be distributed, there should actually be less of a chance to find the right hash in the first 30 seconds than 5%). The remaining 95% blocks should be full since Antpool would of had enough time to validate and include the transactions

Are soft forks not more dangerous than hard forks? At least with hard forks both users and miners can choose to support their preferred implementation, and one would think in the long the the superior implementation would win out (like evolution through mutation). With a soft fork, is there not a risk that malicious actors may influence the users / dev's (depending on the type of SF) to implement a inferior solution? What recourse do we have then? Are we not stuck with it?
Just seems to me like soft forks are a dangerous game.

For those advocating for a PoW change, beware that doing so would bring a price crash that would stabilize around the cost to produce new block rewards. For example, if the network today consumed 100 megawatts but we change the algo and resulted in a total network consumption of 10 megawatts, we could expect a ten-fold reduction in price. 
Not to mention changing the algo would completely alienate and fuck over all investors in SHA256 mining equipment. Not all of us are evil. Bitcoin would be dead as we know it if we had to resort to a PoW change.
Personally I believe even discussing it is toxic. It's the cowards way out imo, plenty of other options before it comes to that.

More competition is good. Bitmain had likely acted to spam the mempool, covert Asicboost among many other things that hurt BTC. No reason to think this new company will act this maliciously towards the network.
In regards to mining centralization in general, it will *always* centralize to pools and miners with lowest cost of power. Sadly, this is not the average home miner, those days will never happen again. 
As time passes, chip efficiency improvements will continue to decrease as we reach physical limitations. This should work towards improving manufacturing competition.
The future of mining is bright.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:12:45
Hmm, yes I agree there are definitely good arguments on both sides so I don't fault anyone from taking an opposing view than my team. I do stand by my thinking that covert Asicboost is a significant factor, but there's a good chance we'll never know.
I'd like to think, even with fork after fork, Bitcoin or the Bitcoin legacy will survive on one chain or another. Only thing that I actually worry about is mining cartels attacking smaller chains (not allowing the market to decide the winner). So far this hasn't happened, so hope it stays this way :)

Sure there is. The value of Bitcoin is based on the required effort-to-obtain bitcoin. If we change the PoW algorithm, the effort is no longer 9500 kWh to obtain 1 bitcoin (via mining), it becomes much less. 
Right now people are paying approx $4000 for 1 bitcoin, or mining it with 9500 kWh. Why would anyone continue paying $4000 for 1 BTC after the PoW is changed, and they can instead spend 50 kWh running computers?

Changing it would mean bitcoins price would drop 95% perhaps, if you are OK with that then fine. 
A better solution than changing PoW is to just defend the chain. Mine it until difficulty adjusts and carry on. Let time figure everything out. Miners won't sustainably attack the chain because it would spark market fear all over crypto, they would be mining at a loss on any coin then and doubtful the attack would sustain. So time would heal. Just my thoughts on the scenario.
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:00:30
Naive to think users have all the power. If PoW is changed, faith in bitcoin is essentially broken. Value becomes destroyed, no one could trust the chain ever again. The threat is thin, its like being in the same boat with someone and throwing away the oars.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:42:58
I disagree, I think a PoW change spells the death of bitcoin and a terrible precedent for future chains. I am biased however, I have invested my life savings in mining equipment.
Edit - to me, the *only* option if we get 51% attacked it to A) stop transacting, B) stop buying bitcoin (decrease it's value) and C) continue to mine the chain, keeping the cost-of-attack high and to simply *wait it out*

GPU's are inferior to ASICs and do nothing to prevent mining centralization. Cost of power is what causes centralization, not access to ASICs. If someone makes a small miner, comparable to the load of a GPU, then the ASIC basically has the same "feature" as GPU regarding "decentralized" mining. 
PoW is about risking energy, ASIC's do this more capital efficiently that GPU's. A GPU is basically a capitally inefficient ASIC, the memory intensive aspect is literally a waste of material and upfront costs.

@_date: 2017-10-05 01:09:02
I agree with you, but you (and almost everyone else) are discounting the value miners bring to the table. Let me clarify: 
What is buying? It is trading effort (dollars) to acquire bitcoin. What is mining? It is trading effort (energy) to acquire bitcoin. Doesn't matter how you get it, if you are getting bitcoin, you a removing availability from the market, increasing "scarcity" or the required amount of "effort to acquire" to get bitcoin. Removing availability of bitcoin from the market puts upward pressure on the market valuation.
So mining is equivalent to buying. The relationship, as you describe is true. Miners follow hashrate, as seen on Bcash. More people mine when more people are buying, and vice versa. So we're on the same page.
My only point is there is a false meme going around that miners just find blocks and order txs and that's it. The fact is they do have influence on the price, just like buyers.

Even if miners attack our chain, I think we should literally just stop transacting and wait it out. Never change the PoW. Hopefully the attack itself would spread fear in all crypto, resulting in price drops and losses of mining revenue all over. Only a state actor could attempt to sustain such a costly attack. Market would condemn attack as well.
In the future, I expect an attack to be considered an attack on freedom of speech and there will be laws against it.

Maybe the price and difficulty will recover, but honestly I doubt it since the attackers will have more resources than us to continue attacking no matter what algorithm.
I dunno. I'm a miner, I will defend the Core / legacy chain as long as I can afford to.. because if we can't defend it I think bitcoin has failed. I'd prefer to see more prominent folk in this space promote the need to defend the chain they support, rather than talk about the PoW change. I'd like to see more leaders promote mining in general. Mine and buy the chain you support, sell the chain you don't. I do believe support through mining + time passing will stop an attack, but I don't know much.

Because there's a cost in both the cafe owner and the purchaser to having to wait 30 min for 1 conf. For such a small purchase, as a Cafe  owner accepting Bitcoin, it is a risk I am willing to take. If I find that I'm getting cheated by the customer, then I would stop the practice of accepting 0 conf. But let's get real, how likely is it that customers are going to cheat him enough for it to be a problem?

I agree. I'm pro UASF primarily to kill ASICBOOST. Otherwise, I would be willing to wait longer for a safer way to implement Segwit. 
Dev's should be pushing the killAsicboost BIP NOW, drumming up discussion and getting miner support, so it can be readily deployed ASAP. Miners should signal for the KillAsicboost BIP, if they don't you can safely assume they are using it...

@_date: 2017-05-23 15:40:21
I agree with everything you said here nullc. However I am still for BIP 148 because it is the quickest path right now to kill Asicboost. I also happen to believe the mechanism of letting the markets decide which chain (in the case of a chain split) is most desired is a natural upgrade mechanism. Everyone in Bitcoin is aware of the associated risks and can act accordingly.
It is true the Bitmain and friends gain more control and influence with each passing day. They are too afraid to fork off because all they really want is to stall to protect their own interests (Asicboost).
I would pull my support from BIP 148 if traction was gained on your BIP to kill Asicboost. As a miner all I care about right now is killing Asicboost ASAP. I could wait years for Segwit if we got that. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:28:38
The patent is worthless. A patent is enforced by the law, how can the law stop a decentralized network from upgrading its protocol? 
Not to mention, with luck, AsicBoost will soon be obsolete.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:54:00
I'm not being deliberately obtuse. Yes, when new hardware comes out it is not easy to get your hands on it (assuming you're small scale like myself), this is a known risk when deciding to become a miner. Even right now new S9's are several weeks to deliver due to increased demand.
But this issue is not the same as an exclusive VIP mining club having sole access to a patented exploit, which degrades one of the major ideals of Bitcoin - a decentralized system.

I mine with Slushpool. I have contacted Slush asking what their plans for BIP 148 are, haven't heard back. I personally am not large enough to influence many others, but I am doing what I can to support killing the covert Asicboost attack.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:45:12
Well, to be honest I don't feel an urgency to activate Segwit (I agree with nullc's sentiment to a large extent). I do want it activated ASAP, but the urgency I feel is to kill covertAsicboost. I believe once it is killed, a lot of funding supporting BU, extension blocks and the myriad of other stall tactics will dry up. Bitmain will start to lose their grip on the mining monopoly and will no longer be able to extort the pools and mining farms (not that they are doing that, but they could be and that's risk enough).
That said, the more I learn about BIP 148 the more interested I am in continuing to support it. If to only show these corporate clowns (ahem Barry Silbert, cough Stephen Pair et al) that they control nothing and bitcoin doesn't care about them. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:55:02

Right, yes thanks for the clarification. Well I'm sort of just blowing smoke but it seems odd to me that Bitfury has never released a miner to the public. There must be good money in it, I mean Bitmain can't keep theirs in stock. I have never seen a picture of any real life Bitfury gear other than renders (Blockbox) or pictures of chips with their logo on it (which means nothing).
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:05:31

Just to add to this - if you look at Ethereums hashrate chart, it hasn't increased in a manner to reflect the crazy price increases. What this means is that when the Eth bull run ends, the price will become extremely unstable as miners will have no problem selling their Eth at prices above the cost to mine (which will be very low).
Edit - I'll also add, when the bull run ends the problem I describe above may compound when miners switch their GPU's to more profitable coins (if there are any).

Guys, we need all the hash we can get. This pool by OP is a start but it's a solo pool. We need a pool to share profits.
ckpool.org is a shared payout pool. CK mentioned he will switch this relatively new pool to BIP 148 if we can get enough hash (1-2 peta). It's really not much. If we can't get that much hash there's no chance of UASF happening.

Buying &lt; mining, when you are mining at a low power cost which Bitfury *should* be doing based on their marketing history.
For sure, this website may not be accurate. But A few weeks ago I saw on Blockchain.info Bitfury had higher than 9% of the network, now showing far less... 
If Bitfury is selling old miners it is only to very private mining farms - as far as I can tell no public information exists showing Bitfury's mining equipment. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:54:07
I don't know what to think of Bitfury. In one light I think they're good for bitcoin - they support segwit, etc. In another light they seem bad for bitcoin - they have never offered their ASIC to the public and have hoarded their tech...
I have only been obsessed with bitcoin for &lt; 1 year, but I wouldn't be surprised if Bitfury just uses Bitmain's product to mine and pretends to be their own entity. I would like to see some proof that they actually build their own miners...

Sounds like you get it. More than most can say after 3 months
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:02:55
For sure and I think it is likely they do have their own product. But you know, its sad that they require at least an investment worth 7.5 PH/s to participate, that is not in the spirit of decentralization at all.
I don't want to hate on them because of all the major pools I consider them one of the good guys, but I think they could do a lot more for Bitcoin than they have been doing.
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:43:56
Personally I believe they do not sell legit hardware, it's more likely a facade. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:42:03
The problem with this pool, which I was mining on yesterday, is that it doesn't do shared payouts it's a solo pool. So it's not going to get much hashrate, it's too risky for most half serious miners (like myself).
Others are working on a new share payout pool, but if you join me on ckpool.org we will eventually have enough hash to convince CK to switch to BIP 148. We can switch to a different shared payout pool when it goes live.

Bitcoin is immune to the complacency that you fear is a threat to Bitcoin.
In time we'll see that even if the majority of hashrate and big business managed to pull a sizable chunk of Bitcoin in their direction, Bitcoin will evolve. You and I, who disagree with this direction will simply stick with the implementation we like. If there's a market there's a market.

It's not about us "children" "getting our way", it's about differing opinions and differing motives. I could say the exact same thing about anti-Segwit, pro-HF crowd, that they're children who can't get their own way too. If Anti-Segwit / big blockers want big blocks and think there's a real demand for it, why not just fork off and do it your own way? Why force us to take the risk with you when we see it as a poor engineering solution? 
Bitcoin is being attacked by the Asicboost exploit, as a small time miner I see UASF as my escape path. 
UASF forces anti-UASF supporters / miners to stop stalling progress and to get the F off our chain.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:32:40
How can a prospective manufacturer, lets say Nvidia, get into Bitcoin ASIC manufacturing when there is another miner holding patents that will put Nvidia's chips at a 20% (give or take) disadvantage? Patents covering an exploit, not an optimization.
It is very unhealthy to have only one manufacturer.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:51:34
Not unless we can get some miners together and get through the first difficult adjustment. It won't be easy. UASF proponents need to focus on getting miner support. Bitcointalk.org mining subforum is a good place to start
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:19:01
There's no doubt lots of miners do say things like "don't bother getting into mining, it's not profitable anymore" etc. So I see your point, just a bit skeptical on the solar angle in general. 
I am also mining at home, power cost around 14 cents usd. And it is profitable now and always will be if we assume the Bitcoin price continues to rise. Just gotta deal with the heat and noise

Yes I am aware of all of that, but thanks for pointing it all out.
Mining is better than purchasing BTC if your mining operating costs are sufficiently low. For example power cost of $0.05/kw-h is probably around the threshold to mine more profitably than purchasing. 
This, however, does not apply if the miners you are competing against have up to 20% efficiency advantage (i.e. covertAsicboost). In that case, mining is almost never profitable.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:31:01
Great, we really need a pool.
I mine on Slushpool (an amazing pool btw) but they haven't yet announced if they will support BIP 148 mining. Would be a tragic missed opportunity if they don't, especially since I've considered Slush to be the little guy standing up against the cartel
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:13:31
I think that most of us feel this sense of panic because we are afraid that Bitcoin will be overtaken by some other Alt. This feeling is driven by greed, really. I have no fear of crypto currencies failing, the use cases are proven. I think the panic around scaling is drawn from the desire that Bitcoin not be surpassed by an alt, lets say Litecoin. In the end society still wins, so this is my point. Crypto will succeed, the situation is not dire for crypto. I have most of my investment in BTC, but I intend to diversify a bit.

Sorry buddy, but your assumption that you can just sell your miner for a profit every 8-12 weeks is a bad one. This only works in bull markets, you are going to get destroyed in bear markets. 
I wouldn't buy 1000 S9 if I were you. It will take you years to pay off the solar capital costs, not even including replacement / maintenance costs.
The reason no one is mining on solar is because it is not profitable. Good luck

I for one do not care at all if Bitcoin price drops around August 1 or for a long time after. 
UASF cannot fail because even in the scenario of a permanent split, the UASF coin will retain the core values of Bitcoin - decentralized, user controlled, anti-dictator, anti-authority, etc

Yeah, which is still a problem. It will be a good while before LN and Segwit block has created enough demand for economic incentives alone to "disable" Asicboost
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:49:50
Hashrate does indeed matter I agree, that's why I intend to point my hashrate at the Segwit chain once BIP 148 is active.
Um, no it is not out in the open for anyone to use. Do you mine? Can you tell me where I can point my miners so that I can also get the covert Asicboost advantage? Can you explain to me and the others like me how to reconfigure my Antminer S9's and which non-bitmain owned pool to mine on?
Also, Asicboost is an exploit and an attack on the network, if you don't get that then you don't get bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-24 20:27:23
I genuinely would like to see this evidence and evaluate it. I should clarify I'm talking above the Covert version of Asicboost.
I'm not technical enough to know how risky Segwit is, so I do think it is a risk, yes. I observe the arguments for and against all proposals, the arguments in favor of Segwit have convinced me relative to the opposing arguments. To me it appears less risky to activate Segwit than to increase the block size or every other alternate proposals that tend to make Bitcoin more centralized.
Also I hate authority and corporate interests, and Core represent decentralization to me while the Consensus Agreement, BU support, Hardfork proposals and Asicboost represent authoritative interests.

Not to sound negative/pessimistic, but considering the total node count is increasing (see Coin.Dance), it is likely at least some portion of UASF increase is Aunty Sybil. There are reasons both pro-UASF and anti-UASF sides would Sybil nodes.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:57:17
So realistically you're in a unique situation, having excess. For most people the idea of investing in solar arrays to mine simply is not feasible, it just doesn't compete with Hydro. There's plenty of discussion on solar mining on bitcointalk.org and the general consensus I've gathered is it is not a good idea from a capital return perspective, although it would be fun. I don't think it's good to tell people that solar mining is a secret that solar miners are keeping to themselves, it doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:14:47


Bigger blocks lead to higher cost to run nodes which leads to less nodes. When your bigger blocks are full what is the next step? From an engineering standpoint, you always de-bottleneck the existing congestion in any way you can before you upsize the pipelines. I mean, if traffic increases because nobody car pools does the city just keep building more and bigger roads? No, they build bus and public transit systems etc.


I dont see this as a failure. The UASF chain will live on, if we have to HF to reduce difficulty, or HF a new PoW if we get attacked, either way it will live on. By living on it has achieved its goal, it will be more decentralized than Legacy bitcoin, it will have less NYA style / authoritarian influence and it will not have miners / businesses blocking important protocol upgrades because their business models are threatened.
In the long run, UASF represents the principals that give bitcoin its value, so I would expect to gain significantly by ditching legacy and supporting UASF chain, long run. As soon as I can safely ditch my legacy coins and go all-in on UASF chain, I will.

A memory intensive PoW is NOT the way to go. 
First of all, GPU mining farms could easily attack Bitcoin if we did that. 
More importantly, memory intensive PoW algorithms are wasteful / capital inefficient. Power consumption at the end of the day is what secures Bitcoin (assuming miners all have access to same chip efficiencies). Making the algo memory intensive means the mining equipment has pointless extra hardware, which is a complete waste. Some dummies already consider PoW mining as wasteful, making t memory intensive makes that argument stronger.

What is your total capital cost / TH?
You know I can just buy an S9, send it to a collocation facility for a cheap power rate, sell it in 10-12 weeks like your saying, and turn a nice profit. While you are stuck paying of thousands in panel equipment, batteries, etc. Solar equipment takes at least 5 years to pay itself off in most locations.
Also, most people don't live in an area where sunshine is viable to have a decent chance of paying out the solar equipment

Speak for yourself. I don't want a hard fork. I don't want asicboost. The only people that support Segwit2x are people whose businesses directly benefit from it, people that want to appear to be the ones that "solved" the scaling debate, or are people who are too short sighted and worried about the price of Bitcoin, that they don't have the balls to support the best technical solution. Which one are you?
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:22:45
Not really. Users and miners will have a choice. A choice to keep the chain or split the chain. And then they can choose a coin to support. It's all good news, buddy

We can't expect miner support. Bitmain has a monopoly, pools will not switch if they have any relationship at all with Bitmain. Miners who support 148 might not switch for fear of not getting any new equipment

One problem preventing this from happening is the Asicboost patents. Even the perception of ownership may prevent AMD or Nvidia from getting in the game. They wouldn't be able to compete with a 20% efficiency advantage.

I agree, we just got to hope it hasn't come to this.
In similar lines of speculation, how do we know Bitfury doesn't actually have their farms full of antminers? No one's ever published the inside of Bitfury's mining farms, I think it is more likely than not that it's full of Bitmain product.

Acts that instill fear = terrorism. Holding a monopoly on asics due to sole control of covert Asicboost tends to inspire fear into any business that does business with you. Inform yourself
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:16:28
Just to comment regarding attacks - an attack on the minority chain will probably backfire. 
First, it will incite even more market fear resulting in further financial losses to the attackers (price drop on both chains) and second, it will cause many on the fence to support the 148 minority chain. The attacks cannot be sustained due to the cost, so when the dust settles the 148 chain will have even more supporters because the attack will have made it clear that supporting the majority chain is to support centralization. 
Decentralization is what gives crypto its value, the decentralized chain will win. Anyone who is in Bitcoin for the tech, not for greed, will support the decentralized chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:41:10
Me too. I think it is likely
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:54:35
I'm not worried about the "visible attacks on bitcoin" I'm worried about the invisible attacks. Want an example? Covert Asicboost. 
I support BIP 148 not because I need to have Segwit asap, I'd wait for years for Segwit, I don't care - Bitcoin will continue to be digital gold. I want the Asicboost attack killed. BIP148 is the quickest way to achieve that. BIP 148 also inevitably forces a hard fork, either the legacy chain forks (to protect against reorg) or the 148 forks before the expiry, either way I get to point my miners on a chain that I fully support, a chain that my miners are competing fairly, the BIP 148 chain.
The only issue you and most people upvoting you have against BIP 148 is the "irrevocable [reputational] damage" that will occur due to BIP 148. I don't give a fuck about reputation damage or a temporary drop in price. Your fears are based purely on greed, not wanting your precious price to be damaged. 
Bitcoin will recover from a chain split. Maybe there will be permanently two chains. Who cares? This is a natural evolutionary mechansism when a blockchain cannot achiever consensus: time for divorce.

@_date: 2017-06-01 03:03:22
You're correct in that the risk is low. But the risk increases over time, as long as the revenue stream ($/kw-h) is higher on the minority chain it will continue to attract more miners. 
Once there's an active pool the only other prerequisite is access to an exchange. 
Hmm, maybe shapeshift will offer the BIP 148 chain...
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:56:24

This is pure FUD. Anyone who's bought an S9 since it came out has basically ROI'd.

I didn't read the article, so take this for what it's worth..
But what a fucking idiot this guy is. Literally does nothing substantial to become a "millionaire" and thinks he's qualified to give anyone advice? Fuck off you lucky little twerp. If I heard of bitcoin more than a year ago I too would have invested some money. 
Sad that some early bitcoin investors actually think they are special and had intelligent foresight.. it's literally a case of right time, right place for the vast majority of early hodlers. That's it
Edit - so I just read the article. Main takeaway is that this little dummy openly talks about how many Bitcoin he has = 403. Only fools discuss or reveal they have a lot of Bitcoin. Screw this twerp lol
Also, he decline 100k in USD and instead accepted 300 BTC when it was worth less... smart move would have been to buy the Bitcoin with 100k
I do agree with him tho that school is over rated and one can learn more simply on the internet if they dedicate themselves. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:46:19
Thanks it looks like you covered most of it.
Do you think the situation forces the legacy chain to hard fork to permanently separate the two chains?
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:06:21
Yup. Only the pool needs to modify their software
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:21:09


My opinion on this matter is that the onus is on the USER to be informed when utilizing a new technology. The folk who go out a get bitcoin without any understanding of risks associated with what they're getting will learn the hard way, its happened before and it will happen again. It is up to the individual to protect itself in an unfamiliar environment, the market has no duty to protect the individual.


I think this is a stretch. Good technology cannot be broken / unmade.


We know the covert Asicboost attack vector exists. We know bitmain has patents related to it + some other circumstantial evidence. The real question is, where is all of the hard, empirical evidence that Bitmain is NOT using Asicboost? The fact is, it *doesn't matter* if they are using it or not. The attack vector exists and needs to be neutralized ASAP. How else is a miner like myself going to invest in mining when this risk is on the table? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:03:38


I have no strong argument for this. However its possible such behavior would result in more pessimism in the main chains price causing further devaluation. A malicious attack against the "users" chain is going to drum up more user support for the minority chain. Might be best for main chain to just hard fork off and part ways, which I am for.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:04:28
Slush is a good pool because it shows the # of users supporting BIP 148. User count is more important than hash as it is more representative of the actual economy. Like others have said, fire up a BIP 148 node and run it until Segwit is activated
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:15:23
Not highly unlikely at all. Listing both chains represents a opportunity, exchanges will recognize this. 
Not to mention it would be reckless for an exchange to list the legacy chain unless it hard forked to eliminate the reorganization risk

Sorry, but this conversation is like beating a dead horse. Pick a side already, and support it. Put some *skin in the game*.
Enough with the I'm-waiting-it-out-because-i'm-worried-about-my-short-term-profits. If you support BIP 148, run the enforcing node.
Edit - or better yet, mine BIP148. Buy some old obsolete ASIC and mine it to show the world your support. Slush displays the # of users mining BIP 148
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:20:34
Agreed. The more I learn about this soft fork mechanism and the Bitcoin protocol in general, and the more I think about the game theory, the more I am convinced the UASF cannot fail in achieving its goals.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:47:42
I guess I mean "run Core until the economic majority agrees to run BIP 148".
The problem with this thinking is the industry leaders will never support BIP 148, for many of the Segwit destroys their business' use case. For example, Erik Voorhees and Shapeshift - the only reason anyone wants alts recently is primarily due to Bitcoin transaction fees increasing and also fear in the Bitcoin markets = hedging into Alts. It's likely the Alt bubble will burst upon Segwit activation, Shapeshift all of a sudden will lose huge revenue streams.
Additionally, when you are an industry leader you must carefully consider your political choices as they can make or break you. I don't expect individuals who have built up their reputations to suddenly risk it all on an unknown quantity like BIP 148, even if they believe in it, it's too much risk for them. That's why it starts with you and me.
But anyway, if you want Bitcoin with Segwit and no Asicboost attack, BIP 148 is the answer. I really think people need to stop worrying about a split associated negative consequences, and instead focus on supporting what they believe in. Every individual who is vocal about supporting BIP 148 (or whatever else they support) helps get the critical mass to influence these "industry leaders".

Agree with everything you said. This is the problem tho, not everybody is able to use it. I have 1 Antminer S9 and cannot use it.

I got ya. I don't exactly disagree I guess, I want the safe path forward as well.
My thought is the "reckless" approach (BIP 148) won't significantly harm bitcoin in the long run. I don't really feel for anyone transacting during the uncertainty period following Aug 1. No one should be into crypto without full awareness of the associated risks. It is a free market after all, some people will have to learn the hard way - which is the very nature of a free market.

True, and this is the root problem with every business involved with Segwit2x; they all have incentives to do what's in their own best interest and not for what's in the best interest of Bitcoin. Barry et al have been pushing propaganda for their own personal benefit.
I hope enough of the market realizes this and continues to support UASF BIP 148. Until Segwit is locked in absolutely no trust or optimism should be put in Barry or the NYA
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:35:38
I understand the argument. What percentage of users do you think would transact after August 1 without any clue of the risks?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:36:25
No, it is clear it's about their Asicboost patents
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:59:44

Its like trying to prevent the internet from "illegally" downloading your new album, good luck limiting a decentralized system - it will always find the path of least resistance.
Asicboost exploits a vulnerability, it undermines the entire premise of mining, proving to the network that you have done the _expected_ amount of work.

Not really a fact. The majority of users don't even know what BIP 148 is let alone which side they support. 
Most people who do understand BIP 148 but do not support it, generally are against it because they fear a price drop - i.e. they are driven by greed. 
I don't care if my support for BIP 148 results in a split, chain attacks and price drops. In fact I am currently mining BIP 148 at Slush. I know that I am supporting what is good for Bitcoin in the long run: decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:15:32

Besides these good points, the entire point of Segwit2x is to get Segwit and KEEP Asicboost! Just read in the Bitmain blog, they describe the HF will not break any patents - they are referring to keeping their Asicboost attack.
Asicboost is an attack on the network - it gives Bitmain a monopoly on manufacturing and kills any attempt at honest competition.
Support UASF, once Asicboost is gone we moon!!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:06:01
I dunno if it's premature. Would more time help? Yes. Would more time guarantee we get Segwit / kill Asicboost "safely"? I dunno... at this point seems like a fork is inevitable. I don't see any risk to the user unless the minority chain is attacked, in which case we don't blame UASF, we blame the attackers 
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:57:02
Sorry, but unless everyone can use Asicboost it is not an optimization, it is an attack. It is not at all like the development of CPU - Asics... everyone had access to better technology as it was brought to market.
Also it has nothing to do with Greg reverse engineering anything. There is a white paper about Asicboost and there is patents relating to it. Like I said, I don't care if Bitmain is using it or not, it is an attack and must be disabled. Mining needs to be decentralized for Bitcoin to work the way it was intended. This can't happen if only VIPs get to use exploits that increase efficiency

I was also wondering what motive these exchanges might have. It makes sense that they would want to protect their business interests, and so by stalling Segwit (through inaction) they are supporting the use case for the shitcoins, as you describe. 
I feel more than ever that once Segwit is activated the shitcoin bubble is going to burst, hard.

Name doesn't matter, utility and mining revenue matter.
148 chain doesn't have to fork after Aug 1, Legacy does to protect against re-org risk. The community can call either chain whatever they want, the 148 chain will be free of the Asicboost cartel.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:27:53


Well, my first thought is that those who are into bitcoin should be well aware of the risks of crypto-currencies, especially so early in the tech's life with numerous attack vectors for a user to lose their coins.
That being said I don't want a user, who is not informed, to get hurt. The good news is they only get hurt if they transact in the high-risk period following Aug 1. The only way they are not aware of the risks during that time is if their wallets / exchanges have not done their due diligence to inform their users. 
Yes the primary risk to unsuspecting users is a reorg from the majority legacy chain to the minority BIP 148 chain. The other scenarios, such as the majority chain attacking the minority chain, is a targeted, malicious attack. I think we can both agree if this happens the attackers are in the wrong, it wouldn't be BIP 148 at fault. 
It all comes down to short term pain for long term gain, the current situation - a mining cartel holding complete control on the ecosystem - cannot continue. Asicboost must be stopped ASAP or the situation just gets worse and worse as the cartel gains more influence. 
Also keep in mind this cartel that is holding back innovation and is therefore hurting users everywhere, it has resulted in increased fee's not to mention a depressed price.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:11:25
A couple reasons. First, I already own 1 S9 and am about to make a significant investment in more S9's or Avalons. I support BIP 148, but I won't be able to support the chain if it changes PoW. From a miners PoV a PoW change is a huge F U. How would I be able to comfortably invest in more mining equipment that mines the new PoW? There would be a precedent for changing it again on me.
As far as I understand there has yet to be a 51% attack in Bitcoin (correct me if I'm wrong). Not only are these attacks costly, but they will certainly instill market fear in both chains when word spreads, resulting in further financial losses to the attackers. This kind of attack is also an act of terror, and I believe the market will condemn the attacking chain and the minority chain will get more supporters. 
I just hope that in the case of a split, we allow a significant amount of time to pass before making the decision to change PoW, enough time to see if attacks will actually persist.
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:35:11
Define economic majority. The few business leaders who are profiting from status quo? From Asicboost? Whose business concepts get rekt by Segwit and what it enables?
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:55:11
Not necessarily. It's not NullCs theory it is an existing exploit. Whether or not it is being used is unproven, but just because an attack vector isn't being used presently doesn't mean it should not be shut off immediately. It is a risk that needs to be eliminated. 
Most large scale miners buy equipment from Bitmain. How do you think those business relationships will go once Bitmain finds out their large customer is looking to kill Bitmain advantage? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:26:38

@_date: 2017-06-01 01:02:49
Um, its about getting the mining hash before the BIP is deployed. The goal here is that we (BIP 148 mining pools) have a significant % of network hash before the August 1 SF date, so the difficulty adjustment isn't too long
And how many so called users do you think will tolerate transacting on a chain at risk of disappearing? Goes both ways bud

There's no need for a futures market, in fact, a futures market is not even a good idea. Big miners can game the market very easily to the detriment of everyone else. I don't think we would learn anything of substance

It doesn't need to be deployed immediately upon an attack. Time should be allowed to pass to see the effect of a continued attack on the market. I believe it will kill the majority chains price as well.

I'm not worried about Eth, or any other Alt.
Eth and the rest are far less decentralized than Bitcoin, or at least that what Bitcoin will become once Asicboost is killed and the mining isn't monopolized.
Decentralization is what gives crypto value, it is what defines security. Eth is becoming more and more centralized, look at its blockchain size growth, very soon normal individuals will not be able to run nodes. Not to mention what PoS will do and the fact that they have a leader.

Thanks nullc. I hope you and your peers can figure it out and present it when the time is right. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:51:55
All that is necessary is that the sole block per day has a better payiut for each pool share than the equivalent of mining the majority chain. In this case all that is required is time before hash power switches.

You don't get it, maybe do some more research before you post FUD. Thx
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:43:05
That's fine. The chain will split, I will mine and use the 148 chain, the legacy chain will be forced to hard fork. Good luck with that

That's fair. I hope not everyone feels this way because else we'll never hit the critical mass :(

Slush is a complete class act. He always  has been. When you look at the plethora of other Bitcoin leaders who have completely sold out, it is truly amazing.

The difficult retarget isn't exactly critical, yes for Segwit to lock in but no for economic incentives. Miners just need to be able to sell their rewards if desired, 5% is enough to do that in a reasonable amount of time (2 week wait).
The 51% attack is really the only major risk that might keep away miners that are economically incentivized to mine 148. No way to predict the outcome, but I believe an attack would cause a huge price crash on both chains. It essentially confirms all suspicion that miner centralization is a disease to Bitcoin. It may trigger more on-the-fence miners to switch to 148 if politically motivated. Users would be creating a shitstorm against attacking party..
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:54:49
Nah, tech and reputation mean everything. Call it what u want the market will follow tech and reputation. Legacy chain with Asicboost and no-Segwit won't have much of a shiny rep anymore considerings it's made up primarily of miners who have been attacking Bitcoin the last few years..
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:13:24
I disagree. The power savings, even if it was only 5%, has a dramatic impact on the profitability of a mining operation.
An exploit on the PoW algorithm should be accessible to all, or to none.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:49:33
Then maybe it's time for a peaceful divorce. Let the big blockers / Asicboost lovers fork off peacefully and not attack the BIP148 "minority". Everyone wins in this case, this is what the community should support
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:49:54
You have any points to support the argument you just made? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:09:01
I meant "Right" as in "Right, I forgot to consider that".
That being said, even a long wait time will be worth it if that ends up being what it takes to get Segwit and kill asicboost. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:05:40
Yup it's close to two weeks. Not an unreasonable amount of time to wait for a payout, and will be a juicy one at that. I have no doubt once we have a pool going the snowball will get bigger. Spread the word :)

Great post. Since learning about the code behind bitcoin a little over a year ago I've become obsessed. I have since invested a significant amount of my life savings into bitcoin because I believe in the tech. I do not care at all what happens to the value of bitcoin short term, I will do whatever I can to do my part in keeping bitcoin decentralized and to serve the purpose that it is meant to serve: as an exit to the elitist, VIP based money we all use today. Segwit2x does not envelop the spirit of bitcoin, it is more of the same elitist bullshit.
I am running a UASF node, I am mining it with my sole S9 on Slush. I will sell all of my bitcoin the day I believe it has lost its value proposition / taken over by suits. Compromising on tech just to get "consensus" is bullshit. 
Anyone on the fence about BIP148 is a complete fucking coward, choose to support one or the other. Stop worrying about your short term gains, you god damn greedy self centered dingus'

That's because you are a sheep. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:54:24
Instead of just hodling both coins like a pussy, why not sell the coin you think is inferior and double down on the other? Support what you believe in
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:10:32
So you're saying that known exploits / attack vectors are just red herrings? You would like to keep these attack vectors open?
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:23:13
Not really. Users and miners will have a choice. A choice to keep the chain or split the chain. And then they can choose a coin to support. It's all good news, buddy
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:52:54
Whether they directly control the major pools or not, the fact is they supply these pools with their equipment. So the answer is yes, Bitmain controls &gt;51% of the networks.
Any mining operation who wants continued supply of Antminers will do what Bitmain wants them to do.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:04:12
I'm OK with blocksize increases and think they are inevitable and agree with you. But before anything, I need to see asicboost killed.
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:39:14
Serious question, why should calming the markets be a priority for the minority miners? Why shouldn't they mine the coin that yields the most profit?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:31:14
Agreed. In the long run as long as BTC increases you are not mining at a loss. You are only mining at a loss relative to purchasing BTC outright, but honestly sometimes one needs to support what one believes in!
I'm also mining with an S9 at just above break-even (high power cost). I will continue mining with it until it breaks, supporting the chain I believe in.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:39:15
I seriously hope it doesn't come to a PoW change. It seriously undermines the idea of making a large investment in mining equipment, which I am planning to do
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:26:57
The only thing I disagree with is a PoW change. Can't the UASF chain keep the same PoW? Plenty of hash might switch over whenever the 148 chain has a higher mining revenue stream. I think it should at least keep the PoW until it is clear that attacks will continually disrupt the chain. I personally don't think attacks will continue long run, it is an act of terror and the market would condemn such behavior.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:04:56
No the first is not unchanged, they are hard forking to a BU / Extension block proposal and also keeping Asicboost intact
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:41:38
Keyword company. Bitcoin is not a company.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:00:36
We wouldn't know, but it wouldn't matter. It is clear it would be one of the major pools doing it. The market would likely react with fear and pessimism and the price will probably drop. Hopefully it drops to the point where miners are mining at a loss.
Already the major miners have and will continue to short the market to their advantage. Bitmain just needs to let their compadres know just ahead of every blog post, and voila, more money in their pocket. The only way for this to stop is to decentralize mining, and BIP 148 is the first and quickest step to doing that (kills covert Asicboost). 
For me the only choice is to support 148 until Segwit locks in. I will point my S9 at 148 as long as I have to :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:27:12
I should add - the big businesses that are negatively influencing Bitcoins scaling (Digital Currencies Group, Bitmain / Antpool, etc) want to stall bitcoin and pump eth. You can bet your ass they directly profit from both.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:31:07
I'm not worried about Eth taking over, Bitcoin is better tech with better devs. 
You're comparing a user movement with ISIS? What about the mining cartels that are blocking progress? If the UASF movement just shut down, what makes you think the mining cartel would ever compromise? They haven't so far, and remember they are the ones benefiting most with stalling. 
I support the UASF because it forces the miners hand and in the case of a chain split, gives users the choice what chain to transact on.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:49:28
It takes 2016 blocks for a difficulty change, not sure what you mean by 4 and 3 years remark?
The only way BIP 148 will happen is if this Segwit2X shenanigans doesn't go through. In that case I would expect BIP 148 mining after Aug 1 to increase well above 0.3% as the it will be clear to everyone that shenanigas are at play. Maybe BIP 148 mining gets 5%. At 5% the rate of finding blocks is still painful, but to get the 100 blocks to spend isn't so bad, a block every 200 minutes or so? It would take 2 weeks to spend the block reward in that case. As long as the BIP 148 token has a higher value  to mine I think it would attract miners.
Now if the majority chain attacked the minority chain, I would expect complete market collapse on both chains. Miners might be incentivized to mine BIP 148 just to end the terrorism and kill the fear in the market.
