You know, for a supporter of a currency which lost 12% of its value in  a single day, calling a currency that loses that much value in a decade unsound is kind of hypocritical.

There is one reason people are buying bitcoin at this point. That is because its price is going up. That is the only factor that matters.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:35:55
And then what? The price is based on more people buying in right? So once no more people can buy in, what is the price based on?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:59:26
Do you honestly think people are buying bitcoin because it is secure?

I like how you compare one fiat currency to another to prove that fiat currencies aren't stable.

Are you kidding? Of course. Cryptography is nice and all, but not nice enough to drive anywhere near this much growth.

No one uses bitcoin for trade. It is purely a speculative asset.

Bitcoin is not a currency. Currencies value don't rise exponentially over a few weeks. People actually buy and sell things for currencies. Bitcoin is an asset, whose demand is solely based on greater future demand for it. At some point, there will be no greater future demand. Then bitcoin's demand will collapse, and its price will follow.

Why would it stabilize? Demand for bitcoin is based on the expectation of its price increasing further. Once that expectation is gone, demand will dry up and its price will fall. This has happened before and will happen again. I don't know why people on this sub think bitcoin can defy basic economics.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:14:05
Of course there is. People can buy parts of a bitcoin.

Neither was the Dutch Tulip Crisis, or the South Sea bubble, or the Great Depression, or the 2008 recession, or really any bubble. All it takes is a speculative asset which a bunch of people jump on to.

Demand for bitcoin is based on the expectation of greater demand. There is no other reason to buy it. It doesn't have industrial uses, it doesn't represent ownership of a company with revenue or assets, and there are no legal structures in place to get a pay out. At some point, there cannot be greater demand in the future, and at that point, demand for bitcoin will dry up, and its price will collapse.

There are three requirements to be a currency. It must be a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a standard of value. No one buys or sells stuff with bitcoin. That would be really stupid, with how quickly its price is increasing, and difficulties actually spending it. It is not a medium of exchange. It is a store of value. It is not a standard of value, because its price changes so much. You never hear about people talking about how much stuff they could buy with a bitcoin, its always how much bitcoin they could buy with a real currency. Bitcoin fails two of the basic requirements to be a currency, therefore it is not a currency.
Also, just a note, all currencies can work across borders without exchange rates or government intervention, if people accept them in other nations, and it is a lot faster to transfer currencies than bitcoin. 
There isn't demand for bitcoin because people want an electronic currency. There are plenty of cryptocurrencies which are better designed than Bitcoin. What separates bitcoin is that its price is increasing, so people expect its price will keep increasing, so people buy it.

What is its correct pricing? How do you value something with no revenue, no industrial or commercial value, and no tangible assets backing it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:02:25
People aren't buying bitcoin because it is a new technology. They are buying bitcoins because the price doubles every few months.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:40
So the price is based on more people buying into it increasing demand? What happens when everyone buys into it? What will its price be based on then?

How does bitcoin help underbanked people?
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:44:50
Ah, so that is why there were [no busts]( in the US before the creation of the federal reserve.

So basically a form of mobile banking (which they already have), with transaction fees equal to weeks of income? I can see that being attractive. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:41:11
Do you know what a bank run is?
