I am the developer of Eternity Wall  which support OpenTimestamps  
I think OpenTimestamps format is simpler yet more flexible.
It doesn't yet support JSON-LD but it could be easily added.
Most important OpenTimestamps could be used with lite client which is not the case for chainpoint v2

Thank you for quoting my blog :)
My current opinion is that OpenTimestamps is more flexible, if true, including a more flexible instrument into a less flexible one it's usually not a good idea.
Chainpoint defines a single hashing type over the entire proof and this could not be flexible enough. Suppose you want a proof up to the block hash (so lite clients who store only block headers could validate) and the hashing algorithm is different between the block merkle tree and the vendor merkle tree. How does chainpoint handle this?
Why does chainpoint need to specify it's using OpReturn? Since OpenTimestamps it's not specifying where it's saving the merkle root you can put it into the script or even inside a non spendable address (I don't like the idea of unspendable UTXO, but actually it's a possible method and it's even not prunable. You also need a different hash, ripemd160, to support this). It's more general (even for other blockchains) that you simply check if the commitment is written somewhere inside the transaction.
Maybe could comment on this and add other points to the list and I hope your conversation with him could lead us to a format with wide consensus.

It's geobit ideator here.
We are very sorry for the errors.
The site isn't receiving recent updates because we are creating a company and we want to focus on security and problems like fake GPS before asking third party to put bitcoins on the platform.
The project is active. There isn't an app yet. Thanks for the feedbacks.
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:56:10
yes, we are. And It's also bidirectional, you can send bitcoins to arbitrary locations to attract collectors.
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:35:38
origin_mismatch error is corrected.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:49:24
It is already done by me and my team
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:47:06
It's weighted on visualization, recent visualization, likes and replies

We are proud to announce Eternity Wall now supports signed messages! Because anonymity is an highly desirable option, but you could want to have verifiable credit for what you write. You could use a nickname or your real life name, the important thing is that no one could write with your name. It’s not an account in a traditional way, actually, you are not registering in any particular server and you are not asking anyone permission... [follow the link for more]

This message is now first in the ranking 
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:24:28
now, if you are paying for writing any amount greater than the fee is a donation
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:28:21
Added a link to this block explorer from Eternity Wall 
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:52:49
We are still figuring out to work with donations (tips and message for others) or paying for single message, enjoy promo time :)
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:41:22
On the single message page, there are three buttons. One is for linking to external blockexplorer (like the one posted from HostFat) where you can see the same message
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:11:26
you can search now.
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:12:55
There is no public API yet. However you can create a bitcoin transaction with OP_RETURN starting with "EW " (hex:455720) and it will appear on the wall
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:26:36
Any feedback appreciated!
New features are coming, stay tuned!
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:31:25
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:53:42
yes, it has been fixed thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:17:01
Currently, it's in promotion. I am paying.

I inlcuded your suggestion in the article.
In case you don't know, you can propose changes to the article with a PR. Look the edit button at the bottom of the article

We are lucky enough to be in a niche-industry with other players like for example: stampery, bitproof, monegraph, ascribe, blockchain ID, clipperz.
Anyway and eventually we will store the data and the compact proof that this data is in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:09:17
The EW timestamping of external documents does not store the entire record but the hash of the root of a merkle tree containing multiple hashes. 
The network will always need full copy of the blockchain to bootstrap new nodes, not pruned nodes will be less in number but forever required.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:54:48
You can find if and when the hash is committed in the blockchain from the notarize page 
You are right that should be possible to find hte hash from the search. We are going to add this feature really soon
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:56:41
Now you can pay the fee for the message and eventually send a greater import to support the service
@_date: 2016-02-17 12:25:16


feature added. searching for a notarized hash automatically redirect to notarize page
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:25:13
doing like proofofexistence.com without grouping digests through the merkle tree, this operation would cost 500M * bitcoin fee ~= 250M$
