At first, I would like to thank you at first for being generous to send a lucky winner this huge amount of money.
Second, my BTC address : 15A9Zedp4A6gozy9vd4gzcWi7mdvhauxKJ
Third, I promise you if that is OK with you, that I give out some of the funds if I'm the winner, to a charity or something (We can work it out together to ensure this seriously).
I can use P2P decentralized coinjoin protocol
Thank you :)

Sir, thank you for your reply at first.
Second, all what you said makes a lot of sense.
But what makes you sure about what you said ? What backs all what you said ?
Regarding bitcoin price, why did you state $700,000 exactly, why not $500,000 for example ?
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:57:28
Thank you for your reply.
But I see people talking about min. of $10k and max of $50k by 10 years from now, what you think ?
Don't you think even $100k is too far stretched ?
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:49:40
Thank you for the video but there is something I didn't get it.
You say that 5 million is 8% increase from the 35,800,000 million.
Could you elaborate more on this please.
Thank you.

Kindly clarify what does that mean.

For me as a person, STRONG FEELING.
Most news articles regarding Bitcoin says that and I can feel the market is slowly factoring it in, it will be crystal clear, price wise, at the end of Feb./start of Mar.

Don't you think the odds will be much higher now ? Or this is just a normal procedures any (ETF-to be) owners tends to do even before the final decision ?

@_date: 2017-03-04 17:47:15
I agree with what you've said.
But on Twitter and here I see a consensus for UASF, or let me correct this more, consensus for having the power in our hands, the hands of the users.
I see a good hype is good around UASF, but will it stand at hype or will we will merge it to Bitcoin Core ?
You know what pb1x, the thing is that we need to move forward, we still have many issues to address beside the block size drama.
I see this BIP as one of the most powerful and logical BIPs ever, it will save the hassle and drama for any upcoming soft fork we will encounter in our journey.
I don't mind if it will take some time for peer review and such, but is it on the radar of the developers or not yet ? Are they considering it or not yet ?
I want to see a healthy discussion like the one we are having now between me and you but on larger scale to know where we are standing and what is coming for us.
Thank you for your reply, I've always been a fan of you pb1x :)
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:26:27
No problem, but if don't mind, could you please if it's possible to use VMware or something to install Windows 10 and help most of us getting this running.
I'm willing to help for sure if you need any kind of help.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:29:59
Could you elaborate more please ?
I didn't see it merged into Core ?
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:18:29
The top answer right now is 
"Give miners control over block size limit (via hardfork; ie, concede to BU)"
BU supporters could easily game and choose this answer.
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:05:15
Not only SegWit, but for any future soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:58:04
Thanks for your reply Luke, much appreciated.
1. It's not a must to reduce the threshold, we can keep it at 95% unless this interfere with the BIP.
2. Since you are a Bitcoin Core developer, could you please tell us what are the team take on this BIP and could we really see it anytime soon merged into our client ?
3. Regarding the miners and the hostility to the network, I agree with you, but as you are witnessing with us, we are at a deadlock, and we (users) are not able to work anything out, but don't you see this BIP is putting the power in the right hands ? 
As you said "ultimately as always the decision lies with the community." and we are the community (users, developers, business owners and the list goes on), so for a reason or another UASF can't be adopted, what do you think we can do to get this done (practical solutions please) ?
Thank you again and wish you all the best :)
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:17:49
UASF allows the people who are operating full nodes to signal for ANY soft fork.

Regardless of the trolls and BS replies, I'm extremely sorry for your loss and would like to thank you a lot for warning other users about BTCJam, actually I was one of the people who was going to invest in the projects there but I've changed my mind after reading a lot about it.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:03:16
I think this could work with you.
1. Download and install the latest Bitcoin Core.
2. Let it sync with the blockchain and download the complete blockchain, in case you've backup-ed the blockchain folder (main Bitcoin Core folder), then continue syncing from the backup to save time and bandwidth.
3. After the sync, delete or move the wallet.dat you've to any other location and move that old wallet.dat file you've in the Bitcoin Core folder.
That's it :)
Hope it works for you mate :)
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:33:11
What about buying Bitcoins with that $300 and hold it, until you work in summer or whatever and buy more and keep stashing, so simply you buy and hold.
As you said, you are a teenager, so holding those bitcoins will pay it off on the long haul.

Never do this, your coins will be 100000% at risk.
I'm on a metered connection as well, but it's worth it to be honest unless you are able to download the blockchain on intervals to avoid bypassing the limit.

Where does Vinny see Bitcoin in terms of price and technology in the coming 10 - 15 years ?
Thank you and looking forward to see my question answered :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:10:49
1. Download the latest Bitcoin Core and verify it (You will find all what you need on the right side-bar of this subreddit).
2. Download the full blockchain but at first make sure you've enough disk space, 140 - 150 GB is good to go.
3. While downloading the blockchain, you will realize that there is an wallet.dat file created automatically.
4. Replace that wallet.dat file with your 2014's ones and you are good to go.
5. Bitcoin Core client _might_ rescan the blockchain again, don't panic for this, it will take around 10 -15 mins. depending on your PC.
6. You are good to go.
7. Enjoy ! ;)
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:24:21
Simply, we _could_ have another hardfork like the Bcash one, it's the SW2X fork.
And most probably, it will result in free bitcoins like the one happened with Bcash.

You didn't continue reporting your latest standings with me in the other thread.
Does this Bitcoin Core wallet you are syncing, controls your address which is this, 1PK9FzjcUxCydZFDcFpQyURTLWPHYbA6Bf.
To know whatever you control it or not, go to the Send tab and look there for it at the lower half of the program interface.

Dear Greg, all what Circle CEO said is a complete BS, don't waste your time with them. You beside the core devs are doing a great work and outstanding performance so far. I'm one of many people who want to thank you from the bottom of my deep heart for what you've done of us (the Bitcoiners) and the normal Joe as well, beside the core devs for sure. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:00:20
I thought the same, I guess the most probable outcome from the SEC is the auto-approve since they don't have an "materialistic" reason to disapprove the proposal.

@_date: 2015-08-27 15:07:25
From which website you are taking the real-time reading brother ?
And update me please regarding my average reading proposal, I'm eager to see it yesterday than today.
Sorry if I'm pushing, but I'm daily addicted to the chart and want to see it fail-proof.

Perfect, I wish you all the best my friend :)
@_date: 2015-08-22 01:00:55
Thank for your kindness, really appreciated :)
1. How far you are sure about the projection equation ? As your reply at the user "riplin" hesitated me a bit, when you said (refine this chart more and more to get the best projection reading possible.)
2. How far you are sure about the growth equation (as it depends on the projection equation as well) ?
3. Can I by any means take this chart for granted by any means, I see it's like 99% correct unless one thing it could make it go wrong in my own humble point of view, which is the growth rate ?
Thank you again :)
@_date: 2015-08-21 00:51:07
Thank you for the chart.
Could you kindly please elaborate more on the "Projection" and "Actual" columns.
I'm trying to understand the chart more :)
@_date: 2015-08-26 14:53:47
Ah ok, makes sense :D
By the way, I thought about something.
Regarding "close", why not instead of taking the reading of BTC value on the 31st of December on each year, take the average of that year ?
Won't this make more sense ?
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:22:22
Thank you for your reply, appreciated.
1. Lets take 2015 an example, what is the projection meant here ?
2. I've noticed that 2016 is 2015 actual + growth and so on.
3. What is "Years" and "Close" ?
4. How is growth per year calculated ?
I'm sorry for the much questions, but I'm highly interested as it makes to much sense for me to be honest, especially yesterday when the growth was at %50 and in 2025 the price were around $20K as it sounds so realistic, what do you think ?
Edit : As I read in the "information" tab, close is for today for example is the price at 8/21/2013, right ?
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:42:46
~~Question 1, yes. But Coinbase is not an exchange, so it will not give you the S2X coins, you need to find chain split service for this.~~
Question 2, your idea won't work, because by then, the snapshot of the BTC balances will be taken and according to each address, the equivalent amount of S2X coins are distributed.
EDIT : As the guys pointed out, I'm mistaken for question 1, I apologize.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:27:22
Well, if that's the issue, where you want to feel safe and enjoy playing poker, then yes, go for what you've just said and don't wait till the fork as it may be somehow messy but I'm kind sure it will be non-event like the bcash one.
Go ahead with what you've told me and enjoy your time and don't worry about Bitcoin, it's stronger than ever and it's here to stay, just don't forget to hodl Bitcoin for a better future for yourself and your family :)
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:30:29
Thanks :)
Regarding the "current" reading, what is the source of the reading, finex ?
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:40:30
Ask whatever questions you've, I'm very happy to help you :)
If I were you, yes, it's worth it to hold the Bitcoins in my own wallet during the split and get my free coins.
Whatever you are getting 25% or even 5%, it counts.
So, if you hold your playing until the fork settles to ensure that you've got your free Bitcoins, that will be more than great, this is what I will do if I were in your shoes :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:15:09
If I were you, I wouldn't let the chance of getting free coins over my bitcoins go easily like this.
So simply, I will go with the 3rd choice, which is, I will purchase Bitcoins through Coinbase before the fork, leave them at my Coinbase wallet, forget them till the fork, dump my S2X which I will get from Coinbase due to my stored Bitcoins for another free Bitcoins, from here I will do the transaction thing you told me about.
IMHO, I don't think it's important to play poker now even if you entering an tournament where you winning odds is not solid 100% like getting free bitcoins due to dumping your S2X coins you will get from Coinbase due to purchasing and hodling the newly bought Bitcoins you will hopefully buy :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:48:38
Maybe you are right, mind sharing the proof please ?
@_date: 2015-08-24 00:58:07

Thank you for spreading optimism brother and wish you all the best.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:07:00
1) As I've stated, I was wrong, you will get equal amount of S2X coins to that amount of Bitcoins you've in your Coinbase wallet.
2) I didn't get the part of the poker site tbh as I'm not sure of what you are trying to do here, if you don't mind, clarify more for me over here or via PM and I will advice you :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 21:02:27

Mass adoption is not a must, to reach these levels we need institutional investors, and this will come from Bitcoin ETFs for example.
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:36:53
I prefer then what "devbitcoin" said in below.
Also, if you download and verify the download of Bitcoin Core v0.15 as "pb1x" it will be better as it will sync faster with you.
If I was you, I would stick with "Core".

So happy to hear that.
Keep hodling and don't be a _weak_ hand ;)
Wishing you a great day as well :)

The $5,000 acts as a huge psychological barrier as it's a whole number and half the way to the 5 digits which is the $10,000+
What is good for us here that, when the open orders at this barrier decreases, it's becomes easier for us to penetrate that barrier and march forward.
Oh, and regarding the "wild month", because we had our expect dip when we touched the $5,000 which is the "healthy correction" for our rally, so most probably we will pass $5,000 this month and _maybe_ we can see the $6,000+
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:24:48
No need to do anything, just buy and hold, that's it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:56:44
You are most welcome :)
Keep holding your precious bitcoins and don't be a _weak hand_ ;)

I gladly and honorably invite you to my decent and humble thread

You are not alone, we are the few who will be laughing on whom laughed on us.
@_date: 2015-09-16 01:05:19
Could you do for us please, if not today, by tomorrow if it's ok with you :)
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:04:38
I'm highly motivated to see it, maybe we can work on some TA from the graphs :D
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:09:58
Where are you my friend ? Are you OK ?
I'm missing you and our discussion :)
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:48:13
I'm sorry for the inconvenience and hassle I've made for you, I just wanted to make the chart looks more and more perfect.
Just a small note, don't you think if we got the growth per day by comparing the current per day with average, will be better ?
That's what I intended to say while proposing the idea.
At last, you are most welcome my friend :)
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:35:57
It looks better now.
What do you think we need to add/edit ?
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:45:48
I thought about this as well and I knew it would lead to negative  growth rate, but it's the truth.
You could add 2 columns, 1 for growth per year related with the average of the previous year and 1 for growth per year as well but related with the mean of the mean of all years existed in your your chart.
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:09:11
Actually it will be more because by 2027,
1. Not all the bitcoins will be mined and
2. The GDP will be more than 7.5 trillion
Edit : This is ONLY if they will store the GPD on the blockchain in terms of bitcoins.

BS and FUD
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:27:50
It looks fantastic, but only after fixing all the issues, lol
Really thank you a lot for all your effort you made into this amazing chart.
Did you figure the errors or not yet ?
If you need help, I can help you in organizing all the errors I see and write them in a separate reply.

You've a bug in your website, Dallasmaids.
I don't think it would cost around $1,110 for a 1-time clean for a 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom ;)

People are waking up and realizing they are missing the greatest invention in the mankind history after the internet.
@_date: 2015-11-15 23:43:53
I agree with you, but even if we reached all the 21 million.
This will net at $114,762 per coin !!
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:29:04
Unimaginable, yet marvelously jaw-dropping.

Golden rule of thumb : It's NEVER "not" worth investing in.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:06:54
I would like to thank everyone who turned this "idea" to "reality".
For everyone of you, YOU ARE AWESOME !!

Feb. 14, 2010: I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:16:46
I agree and disagree with what you've said.
From technical side, you are right, but you can't deny there is an demand in the Japanese market.
From business side, you are wrong, because as you are up with the Bitcoin news, Japan will have 18 new exchanges because of the increased demand.
So yes, it's leading the rally but from another perspective.
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:33:27
Well done. Respect !
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:21:25

Thanks for your reply.
But I smell that you are Bullish regarding the chinese people adoption to Bitcoin, am I right ? and why ?
Thanks again :)

Thank you Luke, much appreciated.
Wishing you a great coming weekend my friend :)

Which will lead to increase in demand at the end ;)

What if we've 2008-2009 financial crisis all over again ;) ?
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:07:53
To be honest, trolls just tell me (and many others) that we are going on the right track, I see this as a measurement of success.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:28:00
Why shall I pay you over market price when I can buy at the market price ? ;)
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:40:39
Maybe they are doing it secretly ;)
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:28:52
Care to elaborate please ?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:36:03
If you don't find a good reason for the explosion in value over the last month as you've said, I don't know then who is the one bullshiting seriously.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:31:47
You've got it right.
But our mega rally is not yet started, keep tuned for it :)
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:59:45
How did you know that we are at Level 2 ?
I'm sorry, but I'm really lost !!
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:07:50
No problem, don't invest because it will not pay you off in the future.
So soon there will be millions like you who will rush to buy 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:36:48
Read this please
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:51:47
I see it more of a safe-heaven asset/store of value than a currency, but what matters in the end is the decentralization and value.
 Still we ain't seen anything wait, wait for the $500 and $1,000 candles ;)
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:50:32
Buy any amount you could afford now, keep holding it till the years end.

And it's applicable for many coming years, it's a non-stop adventure full of beautifulness.
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:27:15
You want to say that sooner or later, like for example 1% or more could choose Bitcoin as a safe heaven and the rest could follow them ?

BIP91 activates SegWit in in-direct way.
So simply, for the SegWit opposers to save their face, they will signal for BIP91 instead of signaling SegWit directly.
Some people say they are faking this or playing games, well, this is a possibility, but I gave it an odd of 10%.
Why ?
Simple, power = money + control.
Jihan have both, would he easily sacrifice half of his power for rejecting SegWit, lets put ourselves (me and you) in his shoes and tell me what you think.
His excuse is that the SegWit fees is unfairly cheap, but to an extent where he would let go his control over Bitcoin, makes zero sense for me at least.

Did you take a "close" today at least on the new posts asking about investing ?
Don't you think this sub-reddit is the "go-to" when it comes to Bitcoin in general ?

Hey Kenneth,
Thanks for the blog article, I'm a big fan of you.
If you don't mind, could you please share with us/me in public/private the expert article you've read today about the price spike in the coming four years ?
Thanks in advance and happy halving :)
