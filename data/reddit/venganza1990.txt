What a great lie. I have had so many people profess the impartiality of cryptocurrency in the last several years yet, as we have all known for some time, it’s no more impartial than loaded dice.

I actually do buy and sell commodities every single day as a produce broker. My entire job consists of market analysis and buying/selling at a profit. Therefore, since I actually make a decent living from the purchasing and selling of commodities I believe that I am more than qualified to determine the strength or weakness of a market based on the relevant information. 
The blood is in the water. If you think your sinking ship is going to eventually float then don’t bother responding to me. 
However, I have met people who have put serious cash into this and someone has to tell the truth. If only one person reconsiders dumping more money into this then I think I may have done some thing worthwhile.

No we are not dealing with shares. We are dealing with irrational exuberance in regards to an emerging asset class. Furthermore, crypto is an asset that is about to be regulated to a fraction of its current worth. Did you know that produce was once also manipulated and traded in the same manner as cryptocurrency? After many similar frauds and scandals it became illegal to buy and sell produce in the amounts that would affect the market. 
The hatchet is falling. If you fail to move your head you’re going to lose it.

There have been scores of legitimate pump and dump schemes in bitcoin and other crypto currencies. If anything most people have acknowledged there is vast market manipulation but, they flatly dent that there will be a long term negative consequence.
