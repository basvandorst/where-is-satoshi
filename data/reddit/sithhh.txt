Thanks. Crazy I was writing this rant and that 14k dip started. I tried to buy more, of course.

Just threw $50 at it. Good price

you and your friend have different perspectives on finance, just let it be. In time your choices could be validated.

Lol sarcasm? Yes, they both claim to be improving something they’re actively destroying.

It wasn't possible. I locked in at 15.1 and the app literally wouldn't allow me to buy. Very glitchy as that time, I was watching very closely second by second.

I’m a believer that all pizza is good and I trust you when you say this tastes good but it is not really “pizza” if it has shit like eggs on it lmao I wanna eat this of course

Thank you for saying this. Don’t wanna get harassed for speaking up but who tf cares about this twat? His supporters look at him like the moth in the moth/lamp meme.

I love that theory and hope to see it (never sold personally) but I don’t see interest coming back. I can’t think of similar movements that gained so much momentum and lost it only to gain it back later.

Not being negative, Do y’all really see 40k in the future? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:23:48
Thank you and yes. Twat Peterson story, who cares, next!
