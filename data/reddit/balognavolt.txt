Won’t they be executed if they don’t?

This looks shady as fuck

Does the chart look any diffeeent today?

You are still a good person
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:56:39
Neat. Except for the music.

They look like they can spend and access bitcoins.

They are made out of cat food. So you can eat. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:00:38
Yes that will

TBH if you simplify monetary policy it all turns into inequivalent analogy sound bites like “moving money from one pocket to another.”  I think this tactic is the basis of most political rhetoric and cult formation. 
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:24:18
I think this says more about Ron paul supporters than it does about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-14 02:01:22
Ok. We found the problem.

My parents were obsessed with amway changing the world. This is relatable.

Buy bitcoin... 9 years ago, apparently

Op post is like saying buy options over treasuries.  Not even in the same playing field.

All about greed. Thailand is a military dictatorship. Don’t fuck around there trying to get rich.

Nobody manipulates bitcoin

This is some variant of natural selection at work. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:22:39
Isn’t this just like beanie babies you can spend? There may be a finite number of them but if people decide they aren’t of any intrinsic curiosity anymore they will lose value. Serious question not trolling.

Let me assure you I am a prince. I have an opportunity to share my fortune of nearly 188 bitcoin I must bring from my country.

The bitcoin will remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:03:52
Why not release the breaking changes on test net? I guess I don’t understand why testnet would be for “production” business use, and production would be for breaking changes. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:42:12
Haha. What’s a bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-13 09:37:29
My thoughts exactly. It doesn’t matter if you bought a collectible or if you bought internet tokens. Capital gains get taxed.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:39:55
Well, that settles it then. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:04:56
Maybe that meant is completely made from open source.

Pogs went mainstream in the 90s
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:39:08
Sure. I’ll try. Admittedly I’m on the fence regarding bitcoin. I am technically inclined through my profession, and naturally skeptical of the idea that digital currency will become sustainable. 
Maybe this gets me off the fence.

Unless the market is manipulated, technical analysis just leads to Magical thinking.

Just a lazy trick to imply depth of understanding to a set of statements that don’t truly have any factual depth on their own.
