Poloniex blowwwwwws, they locked my funds I pending for 6 months, no support

Yeah but it’s the same principle, you don’t have to give bitcoin , but you can lock in profit by holding it. Then just sell it when the contract is due to cover 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:03:52
So what you are describing is in fact illegal. The maximum position any person or entity is allowed to hold is 1000 contracts (each contract is 5 btc). The sole reason for this is to prevent market cornering. This is a highly regulated market, not the Wild West of crypto exchanges.  Not saying it isn’ possible, these guys are always doing illegal shit — just saying it’s something regulators have thought of and there would be consequences if they got caught.

And trading stops after like 7% price changes I think
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:08:47
Oh yea, got it backwards

The definition of arbitrage, is taking advantage of price disparities to lock in a profit right? 
So say there is a futures contract is worth 5k more than current 20k price. 
Step 1: sell futures contract collect 25k
Step 2: purchase bitcoin for 20k 
Now I have 5k guaranteed profit.
Assume I have enough capital to do these transaction/cover margins such that I don’t literally have to take the 20k and use it to buy btc. So yeah you need to have enough capital to do it in practice, but the principle strategy doesn’t change.
So I would say that anytime the difference between the futures price and the btc price is more than you can get with your next best interest rate available that’s an arbitrage opportunity.

Say I own 1 bitcoin and it’s worth 20k. A futures contract for a month later is going for 25k. I could sell that contract, receive 25 k. I then buy another bitcoin and I have locked in 5k profit. I still own 1 bitcoin (all I have to do is sell my first one for whatever it’s worth on the strike date). The key is this is a guaranteed profit — people WILL take advantage of it in an efficient market putting upward pressure on te price until an equilibrium is reached.

Hahah my logic was wrong sorry, maybe they have more which they could certainly dump and cause a crash, but they are looking at a payout of 90 million  max. So dumping billions for 90 million isn’t worth it 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:30:12
Yup 6 months to get my ticket resolved 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:13:13
Yes I understand, 5,000 bitcoins ~= $90,000,000 at current prices. Trading volume is in the billions right now, some dude sold 14,000 today in a short time frame apparently. So maybe a small dip if 5k get dumped, but I don’t think it’s anywhere near enough to crash the market. Pretty sure there would have to be collusion between firms (illegal), or one entity buying over the limit (also illegal) to really cause a dump.

I see your point, not being able to borrow or truly short BTC prevents the real downward pressure find elsewhere (not the same for driving the price up, as you can still borrow money).
However I think it would still cause some price movement in the downward direction. If I am sitting on a bunch of bitcoin. I could still lock in a guaranteed profit (and keep my bitcoin position), by selling my coin for 300, and buying a future for 200. I keep the $100 profit, and in one year I am delivered a $ amount that is equal to whatever bitcoin is worth at that time. Once I receive the settlement, I buy back my bitcoin. My position hasn't changed, and I am $100 richer than I would have been without this strategy. 
I get that this is not %100 risk free, but 99.9%. The only externalities are extreme price changes between the settlement and the time you are able to buy back your coin + transaction fees, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:40:37
Nah, max contract is 5k btc for one entity. So unless they are doing it illegally not worth the payout. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:45:38
Aré you really trying to say that arbitrage opportunities cannot exist because it is cash settled ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:54
Got it, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:13:53
If the futures contracts deviate to far from the bitcoin price, (I think the closer to the strike date the more influence it can have, but not 100% sure about that) it can create arbitrage opportunities, which puts real upward of downward pressure on the price from people buying or selling to take advantage 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:31:11
Yes I’m referring to the date where the contract is settled, I think it’s Jan 18 or 31st for the initial futures that started trading last week
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:57
Holy shit people gotta chill, wasn’t even supposed to be 10k by the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:32
And it’s cash settled so you don’t have to buy or sell it, but to lock in profits with arbitrage I think it ends up working in a similar way to if it was settled by delivering actual bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:51
Maybe it has to do with usdt on bittrex for example? I think some people are worried that tether is some kinda scam
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:55:36
Yes, I've had a withdrawal processing for 3 weeks on polo, no response to multiple tickets

Big dirty shit hawks, they're coming, they're flying in low, shitting on people, dragging them off to the shit nest.
