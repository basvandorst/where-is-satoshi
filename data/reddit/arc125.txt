Did Fox News run a segment on Bitcoin recently?

Why are you freaking out?  It's weird.

I mean, what represents more value: the total amount of gold in the world, or the total amount of currency?  If BTC remains viable mostly as a store of value, then whatever blockchain tech that allows as-quick-or-quicker transactions to credit cards will surpass it in market cap.

Damn bro, that's bearish as fuck on ETH.

Cryptocurrencies in general are for sure the future.  It's just a matter of which one(s).  Currently, Bitcoin is still dominant via the first mover advantage, and given that, I believe it will grow to become a more widely accepted standard for a store of value than gold.  Other cryptos will probably beat it out on adoption as an actual used currency on a day-to-day basis.

Yeah man, people all in on BTC don't want to hear anything other than unicorns and rainbows about it's future.  Nothing lasts forever though, including BTC's preeminence.  Could be 5 years, could be 50, but something at some point will surpass it.

No dude, I'm talking about cryptocurrencies actually becoming widely used daily currency, not just as a mechanism to move fiat.  I know about XRP and am staying far away from that shitshow.  Ergo, if one of the cryptos breaks out and gets widely adopted due to speed of transactions and ease of use, it would surpass BTC in market cap, since we seem to be admitting that BTC will only ever be a store of a value like gold, not a daily-use currency.

Well I didn't say he takes orders from there, but is merely an asset - a chaos agent.  But if he did take orders, it would be in those unrecorded meetings he has with Putin.

That was the thing that the State Department and the international community agreed to do.  Not at all on the level of what Trump has done, which was for his own political gain.

Not really, Trump is the most corrupt and inept president we've had in mnodern memory.  He's a Russian asset meant to sow division and weaken the Western alliance, and is a white supremacist.  It is indeed pretty clear cut that "Anyone pro Trump isn't worth supporting" is reductive but true.
