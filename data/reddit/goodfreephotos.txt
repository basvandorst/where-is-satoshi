But to have it crash that much at basically the exact time the futures expired could mean that it did have some effect on it in addition to the Korean news. I follow the price closely and it was table at around 13k-14k for several days before that sudden drop.

that dip already have happened before that, remember, went from 19k to 14k and it had held there before the 17th. I pay attention to every movement especially if they coincide exactly with an event.

don't you guys think it would at least be a big temporary dip?

well, I wouldn't say the expiry date theories are all BS, I mean BTC did crash right before the expiry date so I think it did have some effect. That effect was just compounded by the Korean news. I think it will swing one way or the other on the 25th-26th. The news right now on Bitcoin isn't that great either. I don't think it'll drop below 9k if it does drop but I wonder which side will win.

Its mainly the fees, no one is going to pay $40 in networks fees to by MS word. I'm getting out of bitcoin and getting into other Cryptocurrencies

Meh, I'm just going on binance to see if there are buy walls at a lower price.

Unfortunately you still can't buy everyday things like food or pay rent with Bitcoin so yeah, the fiat conversion matters to people living in the real world.

Funny you should say that because if I was in mom's basement, I wouldn't need to pay rent and buy food, Mom could do that for me. But since I live in the real world. I need to have these things. The only way that you don't think you need these things is if you live in your Mom's basement.

their talking about regulations at G20 summit, may cause btc to fall again briefly.

not sure, but Cryptos are deadly afraid of any regulation for some reason.
