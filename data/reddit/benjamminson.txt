Some big boys just entered the extravaganza. That's what this was. Fully intentional is my bet.

In this environment 80% from ATH is a deep correction

When you get it working can you send a donation to support our sustainable building mode village in VA?

God damnit i just bought , my fucking luck. How bad is this? Guess we don’t know yet.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:56:08
But how do you rid yourself of the fear that the .001% Dollar rulers (Rothschild, Trumps Russian elite support, etc) are deeply involved in the control of digital wealth, just as they maintain deep control of all aspects of our societies? My only worry is we cant beat them. Seriously, is Crypto capable of not getting completely hijacked just like everything else in our corrupt and broken world of power dominance?

You better believe!
‘Erybody out to get money.
The top dogs create these opportunities!
That’s how they remain on top!
“Hey Billy, I can spawn a FUD with the major media network that I own if you invest for me heavily on the dip.”
Billions were just made in a matter of 45 minutes.
Wild wild west Deadwood Gold Rush style!
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:22:45
It won’t, buy the fear
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:47:08
My negative percentage comfort zone is expanding
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:09:33
8000 coins?

This shows the demographic, fucking spongebob
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:23:28
Yea when it gets near 20k a bunch of people will prolly sell again because they want off the rollercoaster
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:57:23
Must fight hard to avoid the hijack. Most societal freedom movements get hijacked by the big boys who steer global economy. Not sure what to do to help as an individual with minimal comp science skills.. bought some BTC at 13k, thats about it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:29:29

@_date: 2017-12-30 05:00:27

@_date: 2017-12-29 19:02:53
So i bought on coinbase yesterday, $xxx at 13750 and my fee was only $5. Still pending...? What am i missing?
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:12:45
Yea the Trump Pump is coming 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:11:11
So will my buy be at $13750, or the price when it goes through?! It was bank acct
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:23:50

@_date: 2019-02-28 16:56:33
Yea, looks cool tho good work
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:12:50
 I Make a point of saying this out loud in groups and conversations when it comes up relative. I think people are so brainwashed they can’t go their in their minds...outside the box/cell. People hear big words and get bored. Overstimulated and too dependent on to break free.
@_date: 2019-02-28 04:51:43
It’s so busy and crowded it’s hard to really tell wtf is going on
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:58:56
Wasssup Ema?
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:25:59
I think they are braided and then pressure pressed together
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:43:29
Don’t worry if he has a pick axe though, prolly just another miner!
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:52:31
Yea, USD it?
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:52:55
If they truly smother Bitcoin by hijack, just as they disable anything that will take away their profit and power, the digital revolution will become a physical revolution...Yea, Them.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:01:48
Healthier looking chart than last rise through this area
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:23:45
It is prolly engineered to sag a little, but with s slight downward slope 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:51:14
Yea The people are fine; I’m pointing my finger at the global oligarchs that use the American governing body to accomplish their soulless, profit driven desires for power, wealth, and long term control assurance.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:34:08
Yea but a lot of rich elite fuckers just manipulated it down and are at 40% profit already... there is money from most of the ruling global dynasties at this point. And they will do it again and again until it becomes a regulated market. So study up and jump on the first few trains!
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:15:00
Buy now
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:23:24
Then you have to constantly monitor price
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:27:58
Yea i guess you could say the crypto market just got adopted 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:59:56
Nah, this jambo is rigged just like your potatoes and your government - the only thing that can’t be infiltrated is your mind, if you are smart about it, but even those are getting eaten alive these days
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:22:05
Thanks America!
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:49:37
Funny. I started smoking after quitting because of crypto!
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:50:59
The super rich are buying it all the way down with their fancy microsecond trading computers. The banks will have a big announcement about blockchain within a week.. Then everybody will have to go back to work :/
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:46:45
Good to know
Oh and
It doesn’t have to be awkward or small man! Talk about crypto and blockchain with a real person!! Awesome!
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:00:18
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:48:18
If the dollar is built upon capitalism of raw and human resources, what is BTC going to be built upon? 50%the same and 50% new age hope? I hope so...
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:50:01
Don’t hang out too long though, and keep your pace average as you exit the bank, you will need the energy for later when you stay up all late buying alt coins.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:38:27
And did you stencil/spray that code?
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:32:30
Was there one or two big donors, or lots of small amounts?
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:58:48
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:32:28
Yea dude the chance that we blow through 6k first try are slim. BUT the oligarchs do what they want.
I expect a weekly chart higher low to form
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:03:01
Yes
