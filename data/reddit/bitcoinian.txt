@_date: 2015-06-06 14:54:55
did you watch?   Charles says, "when people start to use btc in they're regular life more $ will flow into litecoin"... when btc takes off do you not think coinbase will have an insider for litecoin tech.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:02:57
for example?
is this not infrastructure?.... it's an API... that's what most people don't get..... buils something on top of this

thanks for your honest answer... you will only incur a loss if you sell... your coin has value.... if you need $350 you can sell (still allot of $$ to most people) your choice... China has not banned bitcoin anymore than Russia will (my prediction) Be grateful you can still sell for $350 and you will not regret....  in time the value will rise in $$$... just a matter of time... How much is a unique digital code that cannot be duplicated really worth?  The market dictates every day. If you are still holding you are in for a long haul... give it the full year. (

don't worry about the Indians... they have gold.  Lots of gold.
Gold is denominated in BTC.   I believe.. some day... you will not be able to exchange $/Au   However ...BTC will buy Gold. thus Indians own BTC.

Trace Mayer, an early bitcoin proponent and Lifeboat Foundation Economics board member, says “The Lifeboat Foundation is a good organization bringing together some of the brightest minds from many disciplines to act as guardians of the human race. But what good is collaboration without an ability, particularly a financial ability, to implement solutions? With this bitcoin endowment fund any donations made today enable the Lifeboat Foundation to be the beneficiary of the massive wealth transfer benefiting holders of bitcoins and practically that means an increased financial ability stored in a censorship-resistant currency to implement solutions to vexing existential threats to humanity.”

it could be that those early blocks are lost forever, no one really knows. the thing about bitcoin,gold, silver is that they are stored energy waiting to be deployed. I understand and agree that collecting/hoarding/conserving have an unintended action and reaction,

bitcoin will function as a payment system no matter what the price....saving will be rewarded. I feel we will be at $1 per millibit for a while but who knows? summer we were stuck at $60/$80/$100 all the way up to $125 in mid Oct.....  2 months later $925CAD uuhhh? Civilians say "Bitcoin's down" and I say "From what?"You are still a buyer at this level?
