What is the difference? They are both used to accept transactions correct?

But what does this number tell us?
The frequency (or lack thereof) at which bitcoins are being exchanged?

So if bitcoin days destroyed = how old these coins we can infer that there's a possibility of a cashout. A dump of these old coins will have a great impact on market, thus greatly screwing the guys with new coins (2013-2014)

I'm confused... Is it just the measure of how many days elapse before a newly mined bitcoin is spent?

He created the system so I'm pretty sure he has a better grasp on the matter as a whole than the majority of us.

A short term dip? I'm pretty sure we've all learned that daytraders are lemmings. If they see the dip Satoshi creates then they will soon follow and it will only go even lower.

It's a red flag because selling all of them off in one big lump sum essentially hints to the fact that he doesn't believe in the system which he created.
Making normal purchases as you would with a physical currency would be acceptable. A big cash out is very alarming.

If this cycle keeps continuing then I don't see how it can be seen as more stable than currencies existing today.
We have seen exchanges hacked and prices like a rollercoaster ride... Doesn't seem like a very healthy ecosystem at the moment and the last thing it needs is older coins being cashed out.

The ROI after Satoshi sells of his stash will be fucking abysmal. Wouldn't a true early adopter who believed in the currency actually have spent it by now and not horde it?
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:28:02
Have you been talking to the bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:40:48
Sure it will always "move forward" but it will be slower.
You are too optimistic. If Satoshi were to sell off all his btc then it would be a great depression. Daytraders and "get-rich-quickers" as you call them are the reason bitcoin is at where it is today.
Without their mainstream desire to cash-in/cash-out bitoin will never take off. Sure they've been acquinted with the pros of bitcoin but that's not what they're after. They're after the money. People want money. I actually think now that the majority of people involved in bitcoin are in it for the short-term goal.

But people consider bitcoin to be the gold standard of the alt currency. It's become more of an asset which you can convert to other alt currency.

100 BTC? Ouch. 2011 was still very early though. Who could have known? I remember mining for 30 minutes and considering it to be worthless. Best of luck going forward!

Not really. That's like saying you can buy a Ferrari 458 and a honda civic but after 4 years they depreciate to 50% value. Which hit would you rather take?
Personally, although the percentage is the same, I would want to have owned the civic rather than the 458.
Works the same way with appreciation in my mind.

Cameras exist outside of the phone market.

The state of the cars is irrelevant because a car depreciates by almost the same rate if unused. Usage and mileage account for a small percent of depreciation on new vehicle.

"Percentage increase is percentage increase, regardless of the base unit used."
Base unit is 1 Ferrari and 1 Honda.
