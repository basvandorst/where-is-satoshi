Never heard of it? Sad, it's probably the most famous piece of tech literature in modern times at least among laypeople like myself who aren't in tech. 
Anyway, why have it stay that way?

Got it, I meant can't scale as is. So there really is an effective hard cap on total number of bitcoin transactions possible per minute? Crazy.

This is something I don't understand. If the block size is limited, and the proof of work is scaled for one block every 10 minutes, doesn't that put a cap on the overall amount of bitcoin transactions that can occur per minute? And if so how can the tech ever scale?

Yeah it seems annoying that the bitcoin sphere has become filled to the brim with speculators. 
If you're constantly comparing the value of Bitcoin in relation to Fiat, focused on whether your "investment" is worth more or less fiat, doesn't that miss the *entire point* of Bitcoin? 1 BTC = 1 BTC...

But then the government couldn't print money.
