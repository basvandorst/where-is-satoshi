Uber owns a fleet of vehicles, Facebook creates tons of original content, Airbnb is building several enormous properties, no clue on Alibaba but this meme is pure trash.

I’m guessing this could also affect VPN users who connect through a banned country.

Not bait, honest question.
If this sub wants to promote bitcoin the very LAST thing it should do is associate it with Nazis. 
The goal should be a mainstream audience, not hate groups.

tf is with all the nazi symbolism in bitcoin posts. fuck that frog and fuck nazis.

And a swastika is just some angled lines, right?
Are you that fucking dense?

lol ok buddy. It's been identified by the ADL and the SPLC as a hate symbol. It's nazi propaganda.
But forget politics for a second. One of the golden rules of marketing is to NEVER associate with either side of a political argument. All you're going to do is alienate at least 50% of your potential customers. It's a no win situation. I'd be saying the same thing if people were posting Obama Hope memes. It's really, really stupid. I guess that's what I'd expect from nazis though.

You don't have to care, but millions do. Those same millions that you need if bitcoin is ever going to go mainstream.
Keep it up with the frog and bitcoin gets branded as nazicoin by the masses. They'll flock to something without the stigma. Use your head.

The creator didn't turn it into nazi propaganda. Nazis did. And now that it is enshrined as a symbol of nazism and hate, some genius is attempting to use it in bitcoin posts.
Regardless of how you feel about that frog, it is absolutely radioactive for a huge number of people. Those are the people bitcoin needs to attract. This sub is the single largest community of bitcoin users on the Internet. Using this frog, in any context is sooooo dumb. You may as well use swastikas, antifa logos, or an ISIS flag.

Why is nazi imagery being used in a Bitcoin post?
