What if people did not make a decision yet what they want to use.
I do not have a credit card although it would be easy to get one. When i was thinking about the cc-system i realised that is basically broken by design and that i do not want a credit card.
Now i can book flights and hotels with bitcoin AND the system is better.
Just my 2 cents why i use BTC instead of "the existing system".

I think the problem here is that people assume that one address = one person.
That is not correct. I do have 59 addresses. Very few contain &gt; 1 BTC. A lot of them contain &lt; 1 BTC and there are also lots of &lt; 0.01BTC.
Actually i have have a big amount of addresses with small amounts and only some with much. I like to split my BTC into addresses with small amounts. And there are also the change addresses with only dust.
Also one of the biggest addresses belongs to the FBI. Others could be addresses from the early days and lost due a harddrive failure. Or they could be a cold storage of a big exchange or company.
In the end I think the logic 1 address = 1 user is flawed.

These are some altcoins which use "proof of stake" which is somehow similar to what you are proposing i think.

I think your wording is a little bit unusual.
In short: You did change the hash of the next block and thus when the block will be created.
However you did not change the probability how long it will take for this block to be created.
In fact there are a lot of transactions transmitted all the time:
So every transaction changes the hash, and your transaction was in that way nothing special at all.

This was actually a 402 which will turn into a 429.

OP can still donate with bitcoins.
They just removed it from the front page.

bitcoind -maxconnections=10
This is only necessary for bitcoind. If you use bitcoin-qt the default will be 8 i think.

Sadly i share your opinion. Am I correct that this is only some random post anyone could have posted on some random website?

Somehow i feel glad that i do run a full node (not fishing for tips!).
Just a wild guess, but this could also be a university. They also like to do experiments with Tor for example and a university should have no problem with creating fake IPv6 nodes. As long as they only use it to analyze the systems and report possible issues to the devs everything is ok.
Maybe they do try to do a sybill attack in the real world. Things like that have been done with Tor before by universities, although the Tor devs were not happy about that as far as I know.
However this is just a wild guess.

Normally i do not use Teamspeak. But i just fired it up and the "Online since" time does not get updated if you do not switch channels...
However the "android Version" thing is a bit strange and i do not know how Teamspeak really looks on Windows, but i think the version can be faked easily. Especially the right border seems wrong but it can also be the Windows Look&amp;Feel. But your argument that the screenshot is fake because of the "Online since" text is garbage. Maybe if you elaborate a bit more or show a screenshot how Teamspeak looks on Windows you could have a point.

I don't know if this is legit. Under the assumption that this is legit this is my interpretation:
They are talking about 10k BTC under bot control. It sounds like the bot is not directly under their control and they talk about distributed bots. That could mean that they have a bot network of trojans which have access to BTC which the whaleclub does not actually control. Furthermore stamp is "only" used to trigger a selloff at other exchanges.
If any of you do remember our dear friend fontas then you could sum up everything and come to the conclusion that the purpose of this is not a BTC dump, but a pump for chickuun.
However "fontas" does never mention that chickun will fly in the screenshot so maybe fake;)
Just my 2 cents.

I did see that too. Makes me wondering...

Ok. I knew it for a long time but reddit is obviously garbage. The whole thread doesn't make any sense. Lots of downvoting and strange reasons which don't make any sense but get upvoted. The "best" voted posts have no actual content.
This is crazy.
