Any chance you can post from an account that isn't 21 minutes old?

A lot (not all) of Israeli's want peace - but most (not all) Palestinian's aren't interested.

Unfortunately, I followed all the steps and it just didn't work. I completely formatted my USB, and copied the tails iso file onto the USB via terminal. That much was succesful.
I then tried pressing the option key when my macbook rebooted and the only options it gave me were macintosh HD and macintosh recovery, there was no option for tails.
I feel like I'm so close, so any other help to get tails loaded via my usb on my mac, would be much appreciated.

Can you elaborate. You're dealing with someone (me) who's quite knowledgable with computers but not on the same level as some of you geniuses. 
I've got a mac. How do I boot tails from a usb? Then how do I get electrum onto tails without being exposed to the Internet. I've been advised to do it all offline. Any help would be majorly appreciated.

Ok, assuming that all goes to plan, when I do boot it up, will it initially be connected to the Internet? Does it come with tor preinstalled?

Thanks for all your help. Apologies for the stupid questions. May have a few more. 
Like, what happens when I want to spend? Does it become more of a risk/vulnerability when I want to spend, and how so?

Thank you. When you say write addresses down,I'm assuming you mean the public addresses, so you know where to send to?
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:57:48
Also, is there any way of getting the addresses generated from electrum onto a paper wallet?

You've been massively helpful and really appreciate it. Last question for now. I can't seem to find a simple (under 5 min) video tutorial showing me how I can boot tails from a sub on mac. Could you point me in the right direction, even if they are written instructions. The easier the better. 
Then pm me your bitcoin address as I want to say thank you.

thank you very much. The only reason I ask, is because what's to say that electrum won't be around in 20 years? What do I do if I know my seed, but nothing else?

So i've just deposited a small amount (0.002btc), and it's got 3 confirmations on the blockchain - yet it's still not showing in my account.
Can I assume this is a scam site?
