because you've lost so much money already on bitcoin, why not just lose more money by buying more nonsense? 
@_date: 2016-03-13 21:19:31
ooh exciting. i enjoyed reading your comment :)

I don't follow bitcoin news as much as I used to, but I just wanted to join in on the hate for coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:33:21
It's "shitcoin"
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:51:54
first of all, the majority of polish people are extremely anti-semitic, they mostly begin conversations spewing hate on jews. and this was made in krakow. it can't be anymore obvious...
@_date: 2019-08-29 14:42:46
pfff...this is BITCOIN! 2^256
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:25:01
anti-semitic garbage
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:24:48
That's true, I have just read about the nonce being only 32 bits as well.
From a book I'm reading, it says the initial target when bitcoin was created was 2^224 which is about a billionth of 2^256. So, a miner needed to just produce a hash that would take about a billion guesses to find a number less than 2^224 and it says back in 2009, ordinary computers were able to do a million hashes per second and would need to take 1000 seconds to do a billion hashes. 
Now if you could please correct me if I'm wrong about your analogy. In bitcoins case, the dice would be 2^256 sided and the initial difficulty would have been to roll the dice less than 2^224 times, correct? 
Thanks again for your help.

don't worry, he's got plenty of more money than you though
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:45:08
Awesome. Thanks!

shame. so what are ways i can make profit with bitcoin? other than selling items. just exchanges? because i noticed people make profit from fees charged during currency exchanges
@_date: 2015-07-11 00:03:20
you cant really say its the same way that people make money with dollars and euros. bitcoin is not accepted everywhere at the moment and is pretty volatile. i never inclined that there is a "scheme". bitcoin proposes that since it's a p2p network and mining can be done by anyone with a computer and are rewarded for their work. i dont see the US government rewarding me for printing dollar bills in my kitchen. i was just wondering if mining was still a viable solution and if not, was curious if there was any other way to obtaining bitcoins other than mining and selling goods since, like i mentioned, bitcoin is still not accepted everywhere. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 16:56:20
so its more like a cash register...
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:49:50
bitcoin is still in its infancy. will take another decade or so until true mass adoption I'm assuming. I remember when it was like $350 and I was like "oh jeez that's a lot of money for 1 btc...I'll just buy $50 and see how it goes..."
4 years later I learned my lesson lol

@_date: 2019-08-25 02:57:16
Thank you, this made sense.

when he said the old whale wallets are buying again I immediately thought that whales probably have a site where they all agree on a price to buy/sell at the same time. I remember being part of a group on hitbtc which was a clusterfuck, but they gathered a ton of people to act on a shitcoin at some point. I was a little slow and lost money, but I don't see why millionaires and billionaires wouldn't have the same thing. and they probably have special access to these groups by having to prove their fat accounts. I'd like to track these fucking sites down and see whats going on lol
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:18:22
so the gold rush is over? 
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:24:29
congrats! but I learned my lesson with women. I'm superficial and the girls that I like, like money. So I decided I'm going to die alone with my crypto lol
@_date: 2015-07-13 06:41:45
i can agree. i just started reading up on crypto currencies and bitcoin last week and im still learning about how to use it. definitely not used by many and will take a while. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:33:33
aaaaaaaand it's over. going down slowly
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:37:25
definitely. it's so random..that's bitcoins nature. I got into crypto mid 2015 and noticed that it has times of stagnation and spikes. And everyone loses their freaking minds when it spikes, but when it stagnates everyone wishes it would spike and keep going lol I've literally watched it go from like $400 to then $900, then break $1000 and was like ohh shit..then from there it was mayhem. I have no doubt it will do it again and higher because it always does that. and of course, it will drop hard too :)
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:23:16
ouch. I will make a small prayer for you...
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:56:16
I bet it's in the Bermuda Triangle...
@_date: 2019-04-14 06:56:31
shouldn't we really be using instead of holding? im also tired of the word hodl
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:23:04
yeah its tough for sure. I could have easily put down 3/4 on an apartment here in nyc and just mortgage the rest of it but now I have to wait a good while. damn shame. i was cocky thinking "ahh it'll hit 100k by the end of 2020 and I'll have a good few million" lol
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:05:31
so many delusional people on here lol i put in 30k in alts and I'm just sad I didn't sell at the height in january. my initial plan was to hold for a few years thinking maybe 3 years...now its looking like maybe a 10 year hold. what a joke...
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:09:58
lol so whats a fucking dent then? when it hits 2000?
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:32:12
oh i’m definitely one of them lol
@_date: 2019-01-02 04:31:41
sorry, won't happen
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:51:46
I found the sucker
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:11:17
nice attempt I guess...
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:50:40
don't worry, give it some time and it will be back to 1k
