Why would you sell it? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:26:27
So by selling cocaine you get more cocaine?
THAT'S what I've been doing wrong I think..

But he would still need access to my phone to get those app files?
If my phone is not hacked, my 2FA cannot be compromised, no?
Sorry if I'm wrong, but it's what I thought / read.

I'd suggest 
Coinbase for credit card purchases.
QuadigaCX for e-transfer
Localbitcoins.com for $ 
(Always check fees, depending on where you live)
And ATMs usually cost huge fees

Neo is my favorite.
I also have/like some lsk, qtum, omg, tenx, ark, sys, dgb and zvg.
I simply like their tech, project, team or think it is undervalued.

You guys confirm what I thought.. "too good to be true" often ends bad. 
Thank for your time everyone!

Also, if you have the public keys I think you can always check the balance of that wallet with a tracker.

He says the interests are "fixed" on the initial deposit, so the same amount everyday.
And yeah, I don't believe it too.. but wanted more insights/infos from people, maybe wake him up before he gets more people to invest in it (IF it is a scam)

Thanks the clarifications guys!

Doesn't matter at how much you bought in.
What matters is your ability and patience to hold it, for years if necessary. 
If you believe in it, I see no reason worrying.
If you wanted a quick profit, yeah it sucks right now..

Exactly. In the last 5 days my portfolio $ value took a big drop, but I got more coins than I had 5 days ago (sold mid-drop and rebought lower).
I'm in for years to come. Btc could hit 1000$ and I would be happy to buy more !

If you have the reset code, and working sim, why not completely wipe the phone and reset 2FAs ?

I have the Google Auth and read multiple times without the code it would be IMPOSSIBLE to retrieve.
(Its what I read, never tested it ofc...).
But if a hacker can obtain my 2FA without opening the app from MY phone, it is kinda bothering, no? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:51:27
Wait, isnt the 2FA locked to the DEVICE ? And to retrieve/reset it you need the code they tell you to keep when you activate it?
