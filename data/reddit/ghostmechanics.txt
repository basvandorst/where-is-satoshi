It sure does make a good Father's Day gift. Use this code for $5 off: **High5**
Currently I have it setup so it accepts Bitcoins and they are immediately converted into dollars then deposited into my bank account. I want to accept actual Bitcoins, i'm just not sure which wallet service to use. Im waiting for the Bitcoin community to come to a consensus on what the best/most trustworthy wallet service is overall. 
Do you know of any bitcoin marketplaces I could tap into to reach customers who prefer to use bitcoin?
Thanks for the help.

I like Bitcoin, but I have some concerns with it... 21 million coins will ever be created but since coins can be lost or even destroyed I see a problem here. Like that story of a man that tossed his hard drive in the dump with bitcoins now worth millions. Those coins are gone forever if the hard drive is destroyed. It makes me think the currency will be unstable in the future due to this. 
I also wonder if governments will create their own competing crypto currencies. Imagine USBitcoins or each country having their own. 
To me Bitcoin seems like a beta test. Something better may come along rendering them useless. 
This all being said, I love the idea and I want it to work because I see it as a better solution for currency than anything else the world is using.
