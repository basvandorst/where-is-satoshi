Same here. Coinbase could not verify my identity (the choices they gave me were incorrect). I have been with Circle for about 6 months and I am very very pleased with their service.

Talk about head in the sand. What's built with Bitcoin other than exchanges and gambling sites? "That other coin" has a clear advantage for developers.
I hold both coins (and only those two) and I try to be realistic when I look at the best properties of both.
@_date: 2016-03-06 19:53:58
You are joking. Right??
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:58:51
Spammers do not need money other than some Bitcoin to send back and forth between wallets that they own.

I have a Ledger that I really like the interface of. I also just bought a KeepKey but have much coin on it yet.
I would highly recommend the Ledger.
I wouldn't use a software wallet. The Ledger is brain-dead easy to use.

If for nothing else, better governance of an "open source" project.

I said current implimentation. It can't scale as it sits currently. 
Blockstream wants it to scale (a couple of years of vaporware so far), but I suspect that LN will be proprietary and not sit on top of Bitcoin for the general populace to use.

If it could scale, you would be correct. It can't scale in its current implementation.

It's not a technical issue when talking about core so stop it.

Then accept merge requests that the community as a whole wants.
It appears that you (commiters) are self interested and keep out code that doesn't represent your financial interests.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:24:33
Couldn't you just jump chains and do the same thing?
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:41:25
A problem to solve.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:36:35
If you like Bitcoin, then you have to play by the rules and this is how Bitcoin works. It has nothing at all to do with supporting "core" as you call it.

I can barely contain my excitement.
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:51:03
Same here. I wasn't using my limit before and now it has been raised substantially. I'm a buy &amp; hodler though.
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:09:34
This is the one I have and it is fantastic.

I have a Ledger, but I am thinking of getting a Trezor for this very reason.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:35:18
I use a Ledger. I like it *a lot*.
If I had a Trezor or the new one that is based on Trezor code, I am sure I would like them just as much.

I agree. Do. Not. Sell. Hold onto that coin like your life depends on it.
Don't let your emotions take over. That will be the only way you can lose.
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:48:55
I use a Ledger to keep whole bitcoins on. I keep fractions of Bitcoins on both Circle and Coinbase. If I purchase more to make a whole Bitcoin, I transfer it to the Ledger.
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:32:11
Yes indeed it does. I guess everyone wants to be the regulatory body and be the cool kids on the block.
@_date: 2015-10-07 23:50:35
I use one and yes it is safe. Very nice system they have.

According to the US government, Bitcoin is not currency ;-)

I have been strapped in for liftoff since mid 2013.
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:07:15
This will get down voted I am sure. 
I love my Ledger wallet and I am sure people have great experiences with Desktop wallets. However, for new users, I would recommend Coinbase or Circle. Most likely Circle because it seemed less hassle to get to the point that you can purchase Bitcoin and get it into your account to use.
The idea is to get them into the ecosystem so they can buy, send and sell with the least resistance possible to ensure a good user experience that they can tell others about.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:53:43
I do. I bought in with 2 BTC @ 300 in 2013 on the way to the top, never sold those two and picked up over 20 more under 275 since then. I had rather see it go slow and steady than yo-yo so much.
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:10:06
My apologies. I should have been more clear.
How do you wipe the local cache storage of transactions?
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:37:29
Is this thing really on?
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:46:52
Find a Bitcoin ATM.

Sounds like a good time to look at the Proof of Stake coin NXT
Not based on Bitcoin code.
