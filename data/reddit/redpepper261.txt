On-chain BTC payments are simple.  Maybe someday LN will be simple, but not today.

Miners create the consensus by linking blocks they deem valid. A node has no say in what block a miner should link to.  A node can choose to disregard a block, but it will never create new a block, so it will never cast a vote on which blocks are valid.  At most a node that disregards new blocks is an annoyance to miners.  Nodes alone will never create the longest chain.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:53:20
Non-mining nodes do not build blocks.  Consensus comes as blocks are slowly built, one on top of the other.  The mempool contains only non-confirmed transactions.  Miners move transactions from the mempool into blocks as they see fit.  Other miners build new blocks linking to previous blocks.  This is consensus.  The mempool is constantly in flux, the blockchain is not.  Every node maintains its own mempool, it's in the blockchain where consensus arrives.

This would require me owning a total of 1.6BTC frist.  How is someone opening a channel with me different from me opening many channels with others for the full 1.6BTC?  It would still have the same problems I'm having now. There would first need to be in-balances between my direct channels before I could receive funds with someone outside my direct connections.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:58:08
A good watch.

The extra steps to LN are a pain.  Hopefully there is a wallet soon that does all the steps in the background, so that LN can be as smooth as on-chain payments.
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:47:54
I would recommend testing out the Android LN: [
It might help you start to learn how the LN works.  First you fund your LN wallet with an normal on-chain transaction, then you can start opening payment channels with other people on the LN.  There is an on-chain transaction to enter the LN and an on-chain transaction to exit the LN.  When on the LN you can write IOUs back and forth to trade your LN balance.
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:39:45
Thanks for the confirmation.  It's good to learn all this stuff.
I do feel for startups having little capital to create LN liquidity.   For example, I do consulting and sometimes receive checks from clients for more than I have in all my bank accounts.  If I wanted to get paid on the LN from a client, I couldn't even do it, as I wouldn't have enough personal liquidity.
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:44:42
I didn't reach out to the mods. I didn't understand that was a requirement when I was asked by NotSeeTroll.  I thought somehow you get a direct message from a mod explaining why your comments had been deleted.  No mod messaged me. I answered the question honestly within my limited understanding an context.
I was told that my comments got deleted by the auto-moderator and not because people that I don't know, "my buddies" hijacked my original thread.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:26:03
You give $0.25 as a tip, that would require +50% in fees.  Would it make sense to build this on the LN?  Maybe it would be better to just use an alt coin with lower on-chain fees.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:16:08
As I said, it didn't occur to me that I needed to reach out to a moderator to see why my comments were deleted.  It's now very clear that I should reach out to the mods.  I didn't even see the message mod button until just a few minute ago.  I don't know who you are mad at, maybe the whole world, but I'm not your guy.
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:11:26
So I pay you 0.05 BTC using a Submarine Swap, and you'll graciously open a one-sided LN channel with me?
No thank you.  This would require too much trust on my part.  After I send you the 0.05 BTC, I have no guarantee that you'll actually open a one-side channel with me.
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:30:53
This is my first time dealing with deleted comments.  I discovered they were removed by accident, as they appeared to be untouched while I was logged in.  However, I was away and checked the post from my phone, wondering if my question on Submarine Swaps had been answered, and noticed my question was gone.  I was in disbelief and shocked. Why was that post gone?  How could that be against any policy?  How am I going to receive a reply from the other user? If I hadn't checked on my phone I would have never known. The r/bitcoin mods are being sneaky. At the moment I felt the moderators were against me.  It wasn't in my mind that I should reach out to them.
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:14:41
Put whatever name you want onto the node, it still doesn't create consensus, because a node having zero hashing power behind it, will never create a new block, so it will never add to the list of confirmed transactions.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:47:08
So I'm not wrong that you cannot receive back more BTC than you put into the LN.  Lightning Conductor doesn't seem like a working fix.  If I open a store on the LN, do I have to continue to use some liquidity provider to continue accepting payments?
@_date: 2018-09-12 16:00:40
A full node is one that is both validating transactions and solving block nonces; mining.  Consensus is achieved as other full nodes build blocks one upon another.  A node that only validates blocks has a say on what they relay around the network, but that is where their power ends.  A network with only validating nodes would never build a block and thus would never come to any consensus.
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:01:42
You have refuted nothing.  I do understand how blocks are built and consensus works on the bitcoin network. The consensus vote goes to the one who solves the nonce.
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:41:38
I'm trying to get a better understanding of the LN and how to get paid more back.  I had issues with creating an invoice for Lightning Spin to pay my winnings.
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:24:20
Good luck trying to make your BTC node talk to a BCH node.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:46:01
If no one spends, then the less it will be accepted as payments, making the utility smaller, becoming a fad.  Bitcoin needs to be spent, else their is little point to holding it. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:38:15
Yeah....  I found this video on YouTube.  It's good. [
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:00:03
The mempool is 6MB+ right now.  Unless the RBF option was set on the original transaction, you'll have to wait until the mempool clears.  Knowing what fees to set to get into the next block can be hard to know, as a flood of new transactions can come after your tx has been submitted.
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:15:28
Getting failed routes on the LN is common.  That's what happened.  I tried but couldn't pay the invoice from Lighting Conductor because there wasn't a suitable route.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:57:19
I thought that when a channel is opened, both parties lock up equal amount of BTC.  In all the examples I've seen, this is how it was done.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:31:54
If you run the BTC node, it will connect to other BTC nodes and download that blockchain.  If you run a BCH node it will connect to other BCH nodes and download the blockchain.  BTC nodes don't communicate with BCH nodes.
It's the miners that write blocks and not the nodes.  BTC or BCH is more or less decentralized has to do with the miners and not the nodes.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:49:24
Hello Lighting Conductor developer.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:52:57
Part of the conversation between nodes is current block height.  BCH and BTC are at different block heights, this is one reason the nodes wouldn't talk to each other.  At some point your BTC node will reject the connection to a BCH node.  Also, while you are syncing, you'll get new transactions and blocks from the nodes.  Your node will have to pick a network and stick with it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:44:57
I can't say that I fully understand this.  Is this all done in one Submarine Swap?
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:47:12
This idea has been brought up by multiple people, so even though I don't like the trust required, I figured I'd test it.  Well, my LN payment isn't going through.  It looks like there isn't an adequate route. 
To make sure that it wasn't my node, I did a new payment to Lightning Spin, which worked.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:08:53
You'll need to remember where you got your wallet address, an exchange or local wallet.  If it was an exchange, the BTC might be waiting for you on the exchange.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:13:04
Did you open a ticket here: [
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:52:24
My wallet can receive payments.  The issue is that I don't have enough space in my open channels to receive back more than I've put into the channel, because the channel wouldn't be balanced.
This seems like a limitation of the LN.  How can I earn money and get paid on the LN, when it requires balanced channels?
Edit: I'm using the Bitcoin Lightning Wallet which is one the site developer recommends.
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:26:57
Having to bother with liquidity in the first place is concerning.  I know they say that they need off-chain stuff to scale, because on-chain will not scale.  It seems LN has scaling issues of it's own; routing liquidity.

Unless a node is also doing mining, it really doesn't matter.  The network is secured by mining, not by nodes.

Honey is a great store of value, actually better than gold ([ but will likely never become a medium of exchange.  In order to survive, bitcoin needs to become a medium of exchange, and not just a store of value, as it doesn't have much intrinsic value to stand as a store of value on it's own, like honey can.  User adoption is what will take bitcoin from a store of value to a medium of exchange.  So the user experience is paramount.  
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:15:15
Regardless if this is a troll or not, BTC confirmations are unpredictable.  There is a real loss at play and it hurts me seeing anyone having transaction confirmation issues.  We should try and fix it, not just always blame the user.  That kind of logic will lead to no more users.
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:44:50
Some other crypto will become a medium of exchange, if not BTC.  I'm sure bitcoin will survive, but at what price?  As a novelty it will be a low price, as a medium of exchange it will be a much higher price.  I'd like to see it become a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:12:15
There are other scarce alt coins, litecoin for example, so I'm not sure what you mean by "only bitcoin is scarce."  Being a store of value may be a prerequisite to becoming a medium of exchange.  My point is, not all stores of value are a medium of exchange.  If bitcoin is only a store of value, then it risks losing its value.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:41:43
Please explain.  If I'm misunderstanding, I'd like to know.
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:18:25
I'm sorry that most people are simply blaming you for the problem.  It's not sound logic to blame the user.  Successful projects and companies make systems that work around the user, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:46:01
It's hard to know when you've paid enough.  You cannot predict what other users will do in the near future.  As the mempool fills up, it could easily make enough no longer enough.  It's just too unpredictable, which isn't a good user experience.  I've shared bitcoin with many people and the unpredictable fees has been a real struggle for them.

The only way this law suit holds any water, is if they plaintiff purchased BCH from Bitcoin.com when they really wanted to buy BTC.  For anyone else, there are no grounds to claim a loss.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:05:49
I didn't have much of a choice with this one. It's a transaction from HitBTC, which doesn't lump exit transactions from multiple users into a single transaction, lowering the overall cost per user, while boosting the confirmation time.  They also have two fee options, too low and too high.  They suggested an $800 fee, insane!
I'll sure I'll be boosting the fee here shortly, getting it to confirm.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:44:30
Yeah, totally it's a guess.  But is their guessing really that bad?  When the transaction was first submitted the guess was around 2-3 hours time.  So the initial guess is even more off.
