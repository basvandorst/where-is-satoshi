Actually yes. If you held USD vs investing it in a retirement account it would be much harder to retire. Holding is a speculation that whatever you are holding will be worth more "tomorrow" than it is today. In retirement accounts that bet is those stocks/ bonds will increase in value over time and what you put in will beat the rate of inflation over time. Holding BTC is no different. It's a speculation that it will be worth more later than today and you're relying on that positive growth to increase your worth. If your cash is not in a growth vehicle you are falling behind every year.

So much this.  People are always "oh kids these days are so smart they can use google" "always on those phones they are going to be computer experts" or "my 4 year old knows how to use youtube to bring up the video they want already!"
That shit is not genius. It's not smart.  It's thousands of hours of engineering and UI design to make an interface as easy as possible to use.  Your kid has reproduced an action that a monkey can remember in order to get an outcome that provides a stimulus.  
source: nearly 20yrs of IT work from PC to networking and I've seen how people interact when a thing doesn't do what they expect.  Knowing how to use a thing for it's designed purpose is not the same as understanding it.  Did people run around saying "look at all these drivers, they are going to be such good mechanics" when the automobile industry was growing?
