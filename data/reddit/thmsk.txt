Yes, this is what you have to do.

All these trees and hashes are pretty cool but I fail to see how this can be useful, unless the exchange verifies a list of all the addresses it controls so that people can check that the sum is equal or grater than the sum at the root of the tree.
I don't think any exchange would be comfortable enough exposing to the public all the addresses it uses and the exact amount of bitcoins it has.
**Edit one month later:** Ok I take it back, seems like vault of satoshi implemented it and also made their cold addresses public.

Many computers generate keys just fine without getting entropy from hardware rng. And in fact how random the private keys are depends more on the wallet implementation.
If you want to get more entropy in your system install "haveged" from the repositories. It is a daemon that collects entropy from the usual hardware(disk, cpu interruptions, etc)

How did you manage to get permission from the Bank of Greece to operate an ATM?

Regarding the third paragraph, I guess I should have said "the majority" instead of "51%" as I am not referring to an attack to the chain but to selective processing of transactions before they become part of the chain. I'll fix that to avoid misunderstandings.

Funny that you mention, ["agent programs"]( have already been proposed that will sell you services for bitcoins. Then with the bitcoins they earned they will rent servers to go on. And "Agents that are profitable enough may replicate themselves by spawning additional instances on other servers". I guess you could also build them to evolve and adapt over time. After that, evolution will "find a way" :P

Yes, that would be secure. (Although I can't imagine the average/"n00b" user doing it)

7. Do a clean install of your operating system
1. Save the private keys in QR form as images 
2. Play with them in photoshop or gimp and make them look like pieces of modern art 
3. Print them and put them in frames or on the cover of a custom made notebook or the inside of a pendant or wherever
4. Put a copy in a deposit box in a bank for your family, just in case something happens to you
Now that I'm thinking, I should test how easy would it be to retrieve the QR code after that.

I saw that number(2140) at the bitcoin wiki but I wonder if it takes into consideration the Moor's law and the possible invention of quantum computers or whatever new technology might come in the next 20-30 years.....

Totally agree. Using USB sticks to transfer data between an offline and an online computer beats the purpose...
It would be far more secure to have a computer that you wont use for anything else(no browsing the web, no torrent downloading, no IM) but **ONLY** for bitcoin transactions, with an antivirus, a firewall, glued USB ports and no microphone or speakers and powered-on and connected to the Internet only when you need to perform a transaction or download security updates.
