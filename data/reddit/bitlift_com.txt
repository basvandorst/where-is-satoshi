Instead of venmo, send friends crypto. Instead of paying with credit cards insist on crypto. When people take you up on it, make sure to help them setup a wallet safely.

More and more people are starting to think this way. Our mission at BitLift.com is to 1) Get more merchants accepting crypto as payment 2) Inspire more everyday usage of crypto.  We have a long way to go but hopefully some day we can be of help on your journey!

Yeah, people have been asking for this since the beginning.  Unfortunately no company would offer it since the customer has up to 6 months from the point of purchase to file a chargeback with their credit card company.
The closest thing I've stumbled into is Simplex, which allows larger companies to sell crypto with credit cards, but there's big fees too.
The only solution I can think of is a processor could require you to hodl a reserve with them equal to the amount of payments processed in a 6 month rolling period. Or maybe someone should build this using multisig?

Since it's a tiny amount and just a joke, set up a brain wallet and store your BTC there.  It's always fun telling people you store your Bitcoin in your brain.

Coinbase recently launched Coinbase Commerce which is a NON custodial ZERO fee ecommerce crypto payment gateway.  Most people here don't realize Coinbase offers this.  We built [ merchant checkout on Coinbase Commerce and I highly recommend it to.
