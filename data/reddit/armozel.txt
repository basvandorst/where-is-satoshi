You seem to leave out where I explain (correctly) what fractional reserve banking entails. WTG avoiding where I disproved your assertion that I don't know what fractional reserve banking means. :)
@_date: 2011-08-14 03:34:09
The problem I have with his example of the 'reserve' is the fact it doesn't reflect how the OMOC does business (disclosure: I'm an advocate of the Austrian school, but I don't make the mistake of asserting the Fed makes money out of thin-air/nothing). But his application of the model makes little sense to me, still other than it's a form of the Cantillon effect, which doesn't mean bitcoin is bad, but that is depreciates over each additional unit where only the first user gets the current non-additional unit value. So, I can't figure how this guy thinks that's necessarily bad. 
@_date: 2011-08-14 05:45:56
Yes bitcoins are not fractional because there's no explicit promise for anyone to pay for them in other goods. They're more like coupons for a commodities basket (which is pretty small right now). And there's no demand deposits which can be lent out by MtGox or other BTC exchanges. So, I can't imagine how he concludes that bitcoin is fractional in any respect other than it's naturally inflationary as all goods are in respect their factors of production. 
His same reasoning could be applied to gold being inflationary since mining companies continue to mine more gold to sell. He may not see it that way since the rate of inflation (or rather the rate of production) is relatively small when compared to US dollars.

These aren't ATMs in the proper sense. They're automated wiring machines (AWM)? Also, it would be cooler if you could do a market-value bitcoin to currency exchange with these machines since Taco Bell doesn't take them (yet? Maybe? Who knows...).

I do know what fractional reserve banking is about. It's about having a *FRACTION* of funds to cover deposits on demand. So, any more lies with respect to my person? Or are you going to understand why I said bitcoin is not fractional? In that there's no deposits, therefore no ability to ACTUALLY COVER THEM IN ANY PROPORTION. *headdesk*

And please read my posts again. You'll see I never said it was fractional. Not once. You need to stop attacking me for what I never said. Or do you want to fight for no good reason via reddit (wouldn't be more fun to do that on TF2 or something?).

Because you're being pedantic. Read it with less exacting reasoning. They're round about statements. **headdesk**
Edit: I made statements with the assumption that Don Harold thought bitcoins were being treated like bank notes, which would represent something already deposited, but only that a fraction of it was being held in reserve.
Sorry for any confusion, but I don't always write every sentence or assumption down in a comment. 
@_date: 2011-08-15 05:52:52
It depends on the central bank, but more or less the Federal Reserve follows what other central banks do in respect to increasing the money supply via the purchasing of securities (usually that of their charter issuing govt). There can be variations on the terms which securities are purchased, how long they're held, and etc, but it's pretty much the same around the world. 
Central banks buy securities with the money they issue. 
Then, they buy back the money with the matured securities (and usually the profits go back to the govt).
@_date: 2011-05-18 18:40:27
With full reserve currencies it wasn't zero sum back then either. Adam Smith railed against Mercentalism because he realized it left his country, Britain, at a disadvantage to nations which could swap gold or silver for any other commodity. The use of gold or silver is for price stability of those bring in respect to themselves and not in respect to the other goods that can be exchanged. Deflation in this context comes from outside of the unit of gold, meaning this is deflation due to productivity gains. And that means the same unit of gold/silver buys one more unit of a good, thus the total wealth of the economy is increased.

I think a better way is to link a wallet to an account, but that the wallet hosting service should be portable. In this way, you can just have some sort of wallet container service to handle all the transactions to/from the bank account to your wallet. 
Although, I'm sorta thinking of working on an auction system for bitcoins as a graduate project, so I'm dredging up all the information I can find on such systems implemented in the real world (especially on how commodities are handled in RL exchanges). 
@_date: 2011-08-15 23:19:17
I agree that it makes no sense to call it fractional, but I'm saying it's not fractional because there's nothing being held as a fraction of deposits. Meaning bitcoin as a protocol isn't simulating a bank. Why do you assume I say that it is, when I never said it was?

Can you prove that with what I just said prior?
@_date: 2011-08-15 22:13:44
It does make sense. Lemme explain it again since you don't understand. Fractional reserve banking is the operation of a bank where only a portion of the deposits can be fulfilled at any given time. Meaning ONLY A FRACTION of the deposits are there. They loan out the rest on interest. That's how they make money and that's how the savings accounts get paid back with interest. 
Now do you do understand the problem with comparing bitcoin with fractional reserve banking? As I put it, there's nothing to deposit nor nothing to loan out. So it can't be fractional in any sense. Inflationary, yes, fractional, no. Does this frelling compute or can I assume the English language is not your primary language? *headdesk*

Nope and nope. The mark of the Beast was the mark of Nero, Emperor of Rome at the time.

Machine parts then by your logic is also ever more valuable than gold. But here's the catch, how do you valuate it relative to other goods for a price?

I think the fact that bitcoin can be used for things other than exchange (as money) is what makes it desirable. Plus, the fact it covers the accounting and counterfeit problems more efficiently than gold. Gold is good for those areas where access to communication networks is limited, but in NYC or any other metropolitan area I would pick BTC over gold for any routine purchases.

1. No good in economics has intrinsic value, not even under LTV or STV. 
2. Peter's assessment doesn't dispel the matter of the utility of BTC for which there are many.
3. Peter's thoughts on the matter without him qualifying the degree of his knowledge of BTC makes him at best an uniformed opinion, so I'd say it's easier to discount Peter's thoughts on this matter and that of other goods/services in the economy.

I would hope it wouldn't. Seriously, if the dude's a great scholar and engineer, then good on him, but the rest of this hero worship needs to stop. I feel he's probably happy with releasing BTC the way he did, so he doesn't have people flock to him or get let down when he does something particular derptastic in nature. It makes him free to do whatever he loves and it makes us free to add to his work without having to appeal to his ego (like Linus Torvalds, who's been wrong on a few points in terms of development and engineering, but he's too stubborn to admit it).

The only way they could break these algorithms is by approximate algorithm usage or by finding keys which can be found in P-time. Both means they don't have a perfect answer, which means their target is always moving.

I still have doubts regarding ~~your sources since they don't cite where they get their numbers from.~~ [Edit  I'm still looking at the original paper for myself, but I still have my doubt it means what you or your website think it means.] [Edit  This site is not reputable and the source it claims here is also not reputable as it doesn't return to any original research paper or study. Sorry, this wouldn't even be admissible in court or in a peer reviewed journal. Try something with substance next time.] [Edit  Sorry for all the edits, but I'm doing research on this source right now. Mercola is a quack:  &amp;  These seem pretty damning sources. Sorry, can't accept anything by him, try another source. Maybe someone from within NIH.]
If they ran it themselves I'd like to see the sample data because the thing that makes corn poor isn't genetics, it's soil. I live in a state that only grows a small amount of the stuff due to being semi-arid along the western part (Kansas), but what we do grow definitely has high soil demands no matter which type you grow. It just seems to me that if you have poor calcium in your corn sample then it's due to the fact that the corn's soil is generally poor in that as well. It's been a big issue in this state for sure. I'm not sure how Iowans handle the mineral deficiency themselves, but I suspect they use various chemical treatments and crop rotation. 
Anyways, the second point regarding biodiversity is somewhat reasonable, but also deceptive. There's many varieties of cultivated plants that have less biodiversity than their wild counterparts and that in general agriculture "kills" the wild varieties with some success (and for a larger part due to quality control). So, this point is only valid if we're talking about cultivated plant crops invading wild habitats miles and miles away from human activity. If this is the case, then it's poor land management at the heart of the matter. If it's not the case, then it's not a problem. All in all, I'm all for choice, but if the science of organic(tm) agriculture looks to be quackery then I'm going to call it out.
Also, your point about not trusting science funded by Monsanto is a non-starter for me because if you can get the sample data, the methodology, and all the other data points then you can disprove their point or show their work to be sloppy and unscientific. That's how science works. There's no magic way to obscure things in analysis other than by its absence (this includes missing data sets). So, if you see anomalies in the research then point them out, but that's it. No other criticism is allowed because it doesn't attack the data. It attacks only the 'character' of the researchers, which doesn't prove a damn thing. It's the same mentality that keeps popping up among Creationists when they can't disprove biological evolution so they just attack a researcher for being an atheist/agnostic/gay/etc. Sorry, but if your tactics are that faulty I can't get behind you or support your opinion since it has no substance. Just sayin'.

If they've cracked most of the modern encryption algorithms used today. Even some of the hardest ones, then they either have a quantum computer of immense complexity or they have the greatest mathematicians the world has ever seen.
And they probably have quantum gravity, teleportation, and other hard physics problems solved too. I'm not trying to BS on those points either because parts of complexity theory either tangentially relate to hard problems in physics or are directly affecting them (gravity and/or entropy would be two that a Universal Turing Machine could 'simulate' with perfection if they could prove the Church-Turing thesis at the related levels in physics).

In economics it's called utility. But the utility of a good is defined by who uses it and for what. And the marginal *VALUE* [as a price] is defined by the relative demand versus the relative supply. This is simply micro-economics, folks. It shouldn't be that hard to grasp. **headdesk**

Despite my own ignorant opinions and naysaying in the past I think the impact of BTC will probably be similar to the impact that libwww has been on the Internet. So, I expect bigger things from the BTC implementation in just about every aspect of the Internet since it has methods to communicate and audit interactions between users (note: anonymity != privacy/confidentiality). So, I expect to see the usage of BTC to grow beyond it's alternative currency stance we see today. It may not be used as a single network, but the general implementation will probably replace many existing technologies (I'd love to have a nice anonymous messaging system please.) simply because it does those things better.
