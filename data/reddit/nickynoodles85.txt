How do you know the internet is not already aware? What *is* consciousness? If you look into complexity theory, self organisation, and fractals, there are interesting ideas that point to consciousness coming from the ground up, and not emerging from the top-down like current paradigms would have you believe. Check out this fascinating talk about the above if anyone's interested:

Not entirely true. Yes, the left/right model of for instance, left handling reason and right handling emotion has been exposed as too simplistic and false. Never the less, the division of the brain is there and there is a reason for it. McGilchrist approaches the topic in a new and incredibly erudite and original way. Watch the lecture, it might change your mind.

Yeah I agree. I think it's symptomatic of the modern lifestyle we all live. We are bombarded with more information than any other period in human history therefore our filtering system has increased to compensate. It's also something to do with the entitlement culture we have now where we expect things to be handed to us...a bit like credit! Which is why the implications of Bitcoin are huge in this respect!

Wow what synchronicity. I was listening to this very same lecture not too long ago and considered whether to post it here. You beat me to it. 
You may find a book called The Master and his Emissary, The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World by Iain McGilchrist interesting. The scope and ideas in the book are profound but the part where he talks about money echoes a lot here.
The left and right brain dichotomy is a real one and McGilchrist argues that we live in a left-hemisphere dominant society/culture. This is manifest in many things, including the prevailing monetary system which mistakes the representation of wealth for real wealth. In a left-hemisphere dominated world, the abstract and conceptual is mistaken for 'reality' which, he argues has led us on a destructive path.
A truly mind bending an life changing read. If you'd like a taste of his thesis, check out this 10 minute lecture here.

I would also say that many entrepreneurs are altruistically as well as monetarily inclined. Some people want to get involved for the benefit of an eco system they see doing good in the world, rather than just buy up a load of bitcoin and ride on the coat tails of those who would devote their time to building a foundation.
