Exactly, and the question is not regarding conspiracy, is more about technology, what if the NSA released bitcoin knowing they would always be one step ahead knowing how to break private keys??????????
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:48:31
the real question is: if Satoshi = NSA, how do banks move from printing money to controlling bitcoin... maybe the answer is in mathematics and computational power (bitcoin security, quantum computers and cryptography) !!!

but doesn't that cause the domino effect?
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:37:19
No, because we will know what to deal with...

I know... but the argument isn't ad hominem ... I ask what if they have the ability to break private keys while we believe they don't....

My answer: Bitcoin is not only favored by ilegal entrepeneurs. See bitpay.
Cyberlibertarian discourse is not blinkered and uninformed. 
Bitcoin intent is not to be a government-toppling currency, rather a ignore or no-need-government protocol.
Where are the blatant contradictions or digital arrogance of bitcoin? bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
All problems are ENGINEERING problems if you believe you need ENGINUITY to solve them…
Bitcoin is not a replacement of fiat it’s a new kind of asset/commodity.
Investor jumping in makes bitcoin volatile? yes, at first… so until bitcoin reaches its public peek it will be useful as a “commodity”.
Bitcoin is not like the tulip bubble because there’s no bubble (look at the logarithmic chart).
Currency problems are sociopolitical problems, bitcoin fixes a lot of those by removing the middleman and the need for trust.
Deregulation in a mass scale will bring a stable framework just like chaos has chaos theory. (bitcoin is a protocol and that means a set of rules).
The bitcoin assesination market does not typify the bitcoin mindset just like money laundering doesn’t typify the cash mindset.

yes, but what worries me is the evolution of btc security and who is driving it...
