Right, but the same exact thing happened with switchboard operators, bowling pin setters, and the neighborhood milkman.  These jobs simply do not need to exist.  As technology improves, we find more efficient ways to do the same amount of work with less effort.  Are you suggesting we should just stop improving on existing technologies out of fear that it may leave somebody with nothing to do?

It doesn't matter if it's actually him or not.  This is a guy who just wants to keep to himself and build model trains, and that's all that matters.  Now he's got a huge target painted on his back because some shitty journalist values her career more than an innocent old man's right to live his own life in privacy.  A human being is being unfairly targeted and needs help.  Who the fuck cares if he's the real Satoshi or not?  (hint: he's not)

"Passing" is being generous, methinks.  This was pure exploitation right from the start.  She doesn't care about Bitcoin or Satoshi, she cares about being a badass, hard-hitting investigative journalist.  If she has to throw some innocent old man under the bus to keep her career going, so be it.  It's truly disgusting.

If I'm not mistaken, processing small credit card payments comes with a higher fee (percentage wise) than a larger transaction.  Allowing people to drop $1 worth of BTC on a one-time rental could save them a lot of fees over time.  I agree that it would make no sense to move away from their current subscription model, but is there any good reason these two systems couldn't coexist?  It would certainly draw in some new customers who wouldn't otherwise pay for a full subscription, and I don't imagine too many people who already have a sub would drop it in favor of individual rentals.

Not necessarily, but if this guy really needs help and our community is in a position to provide it, what's the harm?  It may look a little suspicious to shuttle this guy off to who-knows-where, but I think that's a small price to pay to protect this guy's right to live his own life how he wants.  What if you were in his shoes?  Wouldn't you want someone to help you out if millions of people suddenly thought you had nearly a billion dollars just sitting there, with your name and picture plastered all over the internet?

@_date: 2011-06-20 02:15:23
If I understand correctly, those are completed trades.  Can anyone confirm this?
Pic is from 
The way I see it, some account with a huge number of coins was compromised, the attacker put them all up for sale for one cent which basically ate up any existing buy orders on the market until the price dropped to nothing.  At the same time he had another account, or multiple accounts, set up massive buy orders at one cent each to move the rest of the stolen coins (or as many as he could, given the timeframe and the withdrawal limits) off the site as fast as possible.
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:54:50

Also, they said they had started sending out confirmation/rejection emails... has anyone got theirs yet?

Ah, I didn't think about that.  Sounds like it would probably work just fine.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:40:24
You're basically right, but the Mt Gox team also said that the main cause was a single account with a large number of coins.  Obviously, they can't really be trusted at the moment, so who knows.  Again, this is just my wild speculation, but it all seems relatively plausible to me.
I would have to guess it was an early adopter trying to slowly sell off their coins.  To buy that many bitcoins would cost millions of dollars unless they bought in when they were going for less than $2, and I really can't imagine ANYONE spending that kind of money to buy into a fledgling currency like this.  If they were dumb enough to do that, they were probably going to end up losing the money, anyway.
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:10:40
Ok you got me, I'm still awake.  I hadn't seen that timeline yet, very interesting.  Although I'm still not sure I believe them when they say "only a small amount of btc was stolen."  People were able to transfer coins off of their accounts to their wallets while this was happening, what was to stop the attacker from doing the same?  Once the coins are out of their system, they're gone for good.  I have a hard time believing that this guy didn't have a plan to get the coins off the site, and it seems like it would've been pretty easy to do so.  Maybe they do have something in place to prevent 100,000 coins from actually being sent out like that all at once.  It would only make sense... but their actions over the last few days have definitely been questionable.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:48:24
My guess is the entire database was compromised some time in the last two weeks, and the attacker managed to luck out and find an account (or a few accounts) with a ton of coins and an easily cracked password(s).  Then it's simply a matter of setting up all the necessary buy orders to spread out and withdraw as many coins as possible once the huge sell order was placed to eat up the market.  I don't see anything that Mt. Gox can do to help the situation if he managed to get that volume of coins off the site before they knew what was happening.
Nobody knows if this is even what really happened, and it's even less likely that anyone knows who ended up losing all these coins.  If what I said is correct, they were asking for it by keeping so many coins in a single account.  Just dumb.

Could be the most broad and unspecific question ever asked... what specifically are you confused about?


You either buy them, mine them, or trade goods/services for them.  The easiest way is to buy them, unless you have a desktop sitting around with a powerful graphics card - then you can try your luck at mining.  Mining in a pool will give you much more consistent payouts than mining solo.


If you're looking to trade for BTC join irc.freenode.net,  (this information is also in the sidebar to the right ---&gt; )


Basically, blocks store the data of every BTC transaction that occurs across the entire network.  The block chain is shared and downloaded by everyone on the network so that transactions can be trusted and verified as legitimate.  It's a secure, distributed way to keep track of every bitcoin ever made and at the same time provides work for miners to do (generating the next block) in exchange for coins.  This is how I understand it, at least.
@_date: 2011-06-22 07:59:55
You don't need to have the client up to receive BTC.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:43:41
That's exactly what I think happened.  There definitely should have been measures in place to prevent anything like this from ever happening, like the 'circuit breakers' you mentioned before.  Or at the very least, a limit on the number of coins you can put up for sale at one time.  I really can't see Mt. Gox recovering from this very well, at all.
@_date: 2011-07-06 00:10:47
A wizard did it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:46:22
You could be right, but I'm still skeptical.  There are 6.6 million BTC out there right now - this would mean that every bitcoin ever made had to have passed through Mt Gox an average of 11.6 times.  If only half of all BTC have ever touched Mt Gox, each one would still have to have been traded 23 times.  Doesn't seem likely to me.
[edit] Also, as far as I can tell those 1.3m trades in the last 24h are across ALL exchanges.  I'm pretty sure that number has to be inflated as a result of this whole mess... it hasn't consistently been that high, has it?
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:05:59
Bitcoin is anonymous by design, there's no way to tell or prove who owns the wallet that they were originally deposited from.  I'm sure Mt. Gox has their IP address, but that's as close as I can think they would ever come to finding out who it was.  Embarrassment would be a nice way of putting it, yes. ;) I can't imagine there are too many people out there who would be sympathetic to losing that kind of money, even if Mt Gox was compromised.  There's simply NO REASON to keep that many coins outside of an offline, backed up wallet.
[edit] To your other response, I have no idea how they found this account in the first place.  They could've been tracking this person and their funds for a long time, waiting for the right time to make their move.  Could have been random, dumb luck, too.  We may never know! :(

Encryption will be included with the next release of the client, IIRC.  That doesn't help you if your machine ends up with a keylogger, though.  By making a completely offline wallet and backing it up there's no way anyone can ever get to it unless they physically steal it from you.  Booting from a CD ensures that wallet.dat never even touches your hdd.

The way they're handling all this is leaving a really bad taste in my mouth.

@_date: 2011-06-20 04:30:08


Because of the daily withdrawal limits.  Whoever had the huge account would notice if their account was being steadily drained, so it had to be done all at once.


That's the thing, he can't just take them.  He could take out a small amount each day, but that's it.  And he couldn't simply sell them to another of his accounts at regular price, maybe because he didn't have that kind of money sitting around (250k x ~$15) and I'm not sure how he would make sure that they weren't bought up by another order floating out there.  He had to take complete control of the market to transfer as many coins as possible, and the only way to do that was by eating up all the current buy orders.  Then he simply needs $2500 spread across however many accounts (250k x $.01 = $2500) and he could buy up all the rest of the stolen coins (or at least most of them) before most people could even react.


Clearly, with the way mt. gox was implemented, it was possible.  :)  They have a lot of work to do before anyone should be able to take them seriously again.


They were stolen coins, nobody was selling him anything.  He probably only ever put buy orders in at $0.01 on his withdrawal accounts, and I can almost guarantee nobody besides him was 'selling' that low.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:18:54
I agree, but it happened and this seems to me the most likely scenario.  The other alternative is they found and hacked several large accounts and somehow consolidated them into one, but I can't for the life of me think of how they would do that.
[edit] I guess they could've just set up a script to sell from multiple hacked accounts, but that huge 261k transaction is what sticks out to me.
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:26:27
It makes sense if you think about it; a bunch of people online at the time saw that it was crashing and bought up as many coins as they could while the price was falling, some people on here even reported buying coins when they were $1 each.  There's no reason not to believe that these same people turned around and immediately put these coins back up for sale around the $10 mark to make a quick profit, and the price in that video only reflected this once the attacker's accounts (and whoever else was lucky enough to buy some at the time) had bought up all the $0.01 coins.  He could have very well taken a while to actually send the coins out from these accounts (I think it was about an hour after this happened that they shut down?), but once those 230k coins were gone, the price jumped back up because of the people who put up fresh sell orders while this was all happening.  I have to agree, if he did manage to get all those coins out... one hell of a payday.
[edit] I'm going to bed now, thanks for discussing this with me though.  Cheers! :)

@_date: 2011-06-20 02:33:56
Sorry, I'm just not following your logic.  It seems far more likely to me that this all started from a single compromised account.  They would've had to have the database for a LONG time to crack every password to use every account on the site in the manner that you're suggesting.  And I know they probably haven't had it for more than a week or two, because my information was there and I only signed up two weeks ago.  Of course, this is all still speculation and you could be correct.  What you just describe just doesn't mesh up with what I saw when it was happening.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:53:52

"Online nerd bank" is the best way to describe bitcoin, ever.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:45:58
Best way to set up a separate, secure savings account:
1.  Boot off a linux livecd or usb while the machine is totally disconnected from the interwebs
2.  Install bitcoin, generate some addresses, save them to a text file or write them down (these are your receiving addresses)
3.  Encrypt this new wallet.dat (truecrypt, 7zip, whatever you want) and back it up to several places.  Burn one copy to a cd, one on a usb drive, keep these in a safe location.  Upload one to dropbox or something similar in case your house burns down!
4.  You now have a one-way savings account that should be completely secure.  Send as many coins as you want to it and they'll be safe until you need them again.  Reverse the steps when you need to make a withdrawal, then create another savings wallet following these same steps.
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2011-06-20 07:24:41
Exactly... and how do they define "small amount"?  They moved 460k coins around during this ordeal to keep them safe... a "small amount" to them could be anything from 1000-50000.  Feels like they're just trying to save face and hang on to as many users as they can.
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:12:43
The account that got hacked had far more than $500,000 worth.  I don't remember the exact figure but it was in the ballpark of 500k BTC.

It gets exponentially harder to crack passwords as you increase the number of characters - you should be fine.  Still, if you use the password anywhere else, you should definitely change it to be on the safe side.
@_date: 2011-06-21 02:06:36
That's what I'm thinking now... they were Gox's coins to begin with and the hacker had no intention of keeping any for himself.  Just a Robin Hood of sorts, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.  This would explain why they were so quick to announce a rollback and why what they've said so far has been so cryptic and riddled with holes.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:25:14
I don't think this is true - I was online during the attack and none of my coins or funds were touched.  Same for a few other people I know.
I believe them when they say it was one account with a ton of coins.  The attacker could set up a massive sell order at .01 to eat up all the existing buy orders, and at the same time have other accounts set up to buy the rest of the coins at one cent each and then move them off the site as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2011-06-22 01:09:14

I doubt this is the case.  They take 0.65% from each transaction: 500,000 BTC / 0.0065 = 76,923,076 BTC would have had to been traded thus far to account for that many in commissions.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:55:53
I thought the same thing at first, but it turns out that's actually not true.  See [this comment]( and [this one too]( for some great explanations.  It turns out that the 10 minute block target with BTC might just be too conservative for its own good.

@_date: 2013-04-03 19:49:04
Nothing really changed from $0.01 -&gt; $20 either, if you want to put it that way.  Personally, I would be incredibly surprised to see bitcoins ever trading at $20 again, much less $0.01.  The cat is out of the bag now and I don't think he's going back in.  Here's a quote from a friend on FB that I feel sums up the situation pretty well:
"I don't claim to have the answer to whether bitcoin is too high or too low right now based on future expectations, but I do suspect that there are a lot of people who have never heard of Bitcoin today who will be using it in a few years. The current price reflects the fact that lots of other people suspect the same thing. We'll see who is right."

I've never used mutlibit so I can't say much about it.  Electrum does give you the option to use encryption with a password, and I can't think of any reason you wouldn't want to do that.  If multibit doesn't support that, definitely go with electrum.  I really like it so far!
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:50:55
I only recently started using it as well, but this is how I understand it.  Electrum uses the seed and a deterministic algorithm to create the addresses (and their corresponding private keys) in your wallet.  Basically, as long as you input the exact same seed when you want to recover a wallet, it will generate the exact same addresses and keys every time.  So even if you don't have a backup, you can recreate the wallet from scratch and still have access to any coins you had in there.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:20:17
Awesome, thanks.  Looks like I have a new favorite wallet :P
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:32:43
I agree with you completely, and I do hope to one day see a real separation of bitcoin from fiat currency.  However, because it's such a fundamentally different technology, it's going to take quite a while for such a shift to occur.  Until merchants can re-stock and pay operating costs with BTC, there's no way they can avoid switching back to fiat immediately if they want to stay in business.  I do think that bitcoin CAN be successful while still tied to fiat as it is now, but not with the volatility we've seen recently.  I think that's the real first step towards an entirely bitcoin-based economy; it needs to have a stable value against fiat currencies before we can really move away from them.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:01:18
You could very well be right, it's just hard to say without the actual numbers.  
For some quick ballpark calculations, let's assume a TX fee of 0.0005 with one bet placed every 10 seconds.  0.0005 \* 6 \* 60 \* 24 \* 7 = 30.24 BTC in fees per week, per bot.
SD is basically guaranteed to profit 2% from every outside bet placed, so they would need to bring in 30.24 / 0.02 = **1512** BTC (per bot) every week in new bets just to offset the cost.  
Doesn't seem completely unreasonable, but I still question whether or not they would spend those extra BTC instead of just sitting back and enjoying the 2% guaranteed profit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:36:01
Seriously?  Do you think they would still be operating today, after being in business for ~3 years, if they were stealing people's money?
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:07:39
You only have a 98% expected return.  Which means, for every 100 BTC you bet (no matter which bet you play) you can only expect to get 98 BTC in return.  That's how they make so much money, it's just guaranteed profits for them.  The only way to win is not to play.
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:04:19
It may be a minor tweak, but it's still an advantage over bitcoins (albeit a minor one in the grand scheme of things).  I'm of the opinion that further decentralizing an already decentralized currency won't hurt things in the long run.  If litecoins really bring nothing significant to the table, don't you believe that the free market would eventually reflect that?
I'm not trying to be rude, I just don't think it's unreasonable to think that multiple cryptocurrencies could eventually coexist peacefully.  I think it may actually be one of the best things for the long-term future of cryptos in general.  More successful coins means more competition, which will eventually lead to a better product in some way or another.  I'm not saying litecoin is or is not better than bitcoin, because they both have their pros and cons, and I honestly think it's too early to say either way whether one will eventually "win out".  However, it certainly is opening the door for further improvements upon the bitcoin protocol down the road, and I don't think that's a bad thing at all.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:56:06
Definitely.  I think that's one of the next logical steps, too.  We've already come quite a ways with regards to safety (the earlier bitcoin-qt client didn't even allow you to encrypt your wallet from within the program, and there were few alternatives), but there's still much room for improvement on the usability side.

@_date: 2013-03-21 18:48:34
Huh.  I missed that part, but I still don't see how it would be possible to figure out the final hash (with the lucky number in front, which determines a win/loss) without having the transaction already in the blockchain.  Maybe they're worried about double spends?  I guess they could potentially do that with a bot, but I imagine it would be difficult to hide all those double spends until they finally hit a winning bet.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:27:39
I'm not so sure the bots are run by SD.  They still have to pay a TX fee on every bet, and with a bot (or bots) running 24/7 that would add up quickly.  Granted, the bot is likely to bring in some new traffic when it hits big like this, but I don't think that revenue would be enough to offset weeks worth of TX fees.

Plenty of people said the same thing at $40, $50, $75 etc... just saying.  I don't think this meteoric rise in price can continue forever, but I'm not sure we're at the top yet, either.
[edit]  That said, I definitely agree that OP should cash out enough to pay back his loan as soon as possible.  He did a stupid thing and got rewarded for it, no point in taking further risks.

Go to satoshidice.com and copy the address corresponding to the bet you want to place.  For example, 1dice1e6pdhLzzWQq7yMidf6j8eAg7pkY is the address for the highest payout bet, with a chance to win of 0.0015%.  Then just open up your bitcoin client and send your bet to that address.  If you win, you'll get your winnings sent back to your wallet automatically in a couple minutes or so.  If you lose, you'll get back 1 satoshi (= 0.00000001 BTC).

As I understand it, you don't need to make backups of electrum.dat because you can always recover it from the seed mnemonic, even if you generate new addresses.  I think you're good to go with the setup you described.  Probably wouldn't be a bad idea to physically write down the seed somewhere, too, as long as you can keep it safe.

If it's that easy then what the fuck are you doing posting here?  I'll buy some BovaCoins as soon as you get them up and running, let's make it happen.

That $272k is a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the total market value, so I really doubt the rally over the last month is just because of him.  People have been throwing so much money in to BTC lately that anon_bitcoin_gambler's contribution is really just a drop in the bucket. :P

This is the new milestone I'm waiting for... I think I can die happy if I'm able to trade 1 BTC for an alpha black lotus some day.

Thank you, this is what OP seems to be missing.  We don't want them to act like a bank, we want the exchange to fucking work properly.  Check out [this post]( in another thread for some examples of how terrible their trading platform is at the moment.  They could've implemented changes like these weeks ago when the huge lag spikes started happening, but they didn't, and now here we are.  I can only hope they and the other exchanges learn from these mistakes going forward.  This crash is not indicative of a problem with the bitcoin protocol.  It is entirely the fault of the antiquated trading engines we've been forced to deal with in order to buy and sell the damn things.  Hopefully this is the wake up call they need to get their shit together.

If you were losing sleep you invested too much to begin with.  I think you made the right choice here.

I was playing around with Electrum for the first time last night, and I want to make sure I understand the "seed wallet" feature.  If I memorize or write down the seed somewhere, does that mean I never have to make backups of my wallet (which I'm assuming is in electrum.dat) since it can be recovered from the seed?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:48:03
Should be possible, but I don't have time to figure out exactly how at the moment.  This should help if you want to dig further: 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:38:00
I believe that is correct.  This means you don't need to worry about backing up electrum.dat.  It probably wouldn't hurt to keep a backup anyway, in case you ever lose the seed somehow.

Faster confirmations aren't an advantage?  
I do agree with you about scrypt, though.  It doesn't seem to provide any major advantage in and of itself vs. SHA256, and it's downright silly that everyone was touting it as "GPU-resistant" when it has proven to be anything but.  I think we'll see LTC ASICs soon enough, too.  However, scrypt is obviously working well enough at the moment to secure the LTC network, and I think just the fact that it *isn't* SHA256 is an advantage for the entire combined network, in that it makes it less susceptible to a single vector of attack (however unlikely that may be).
Again, in my eyes, the main thing that LTC provides is competition.  Developers will see LTC's success and start thinking about ways to further improve both protocols, which will lead to stronger, more accessible, more robust cryptos in the future.  Even if that means BTC is eventually dethroned (and let me be clear, I personally don't think LTC will be the coin to do that), I think it's a good thing in the long run.

@_date: 2013-04-11 00:24:22
Yep, that's what I meant.  I think that's all you can do within electrum, but if you wanted to you could encrypt electrum.dat further with truecrypt or a password protected .rar file.
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:04:48
Exactly!  This would hurt legitimate users more than it could ever hurt the criminals it's supposed to combat.  Absolutely terrible idea.

I just double checked, and Mtgox has a minimum of 0.01 BTC for both buy and sell orders.  Where did you see 1 BTC minimum?

Did you read the article?  Nobody is saying it's not volatile right now, because it obviously is.  And probably will be for the next few years, at least.  That said, barring some catastrophic news or other unforeseen event, it's only a matter of time before increased adoption and liquidity will help to alleviate the volatility problem.

Cash, on the other hand, is not complicated and can also be used to facilitate such activities.  Was he even making a point at all?  Ugh.

The secret is worthless until they have the TX hash from the blockchain, after the fees are paid.  I don't see how they could do what you're suggesting.

Read the second comment that I linked:


That's tolerable as an extreme case, but imagine if the block target were 1 minute... then there would be miners spending most of their time BEHIND the network, mining old blocks. By setting a block target you're aiming to estimate a level at which you never encounter this situation. With Bitcoin, it was set at the extremely conservative value of 10 minutes because there was no data to work off of to set a block target scientifically.
Litecoin took advantage of years of Bitcoin network data in establishing that 2.5 minutes was a better compromise between expediency and cycle waste.
Bitcoin may still turn out to be a great means of transacting between Earth and Mars in 50 years when we actually care about having a transaction network that can handle network latencies of a few minutes.
Ten minutes is simply a much longer block target than it needs to be with the speed of today's technology.  And, unless you expect the average global computing power/connection speed to go down in the future, it will be way, way, WAY longer than it needs to be.  Satoshi set the ten minute target back in 2009 as a conservative starting point because no data was available to estimate whether or not the network would be able to handle a shorter one.  Now that bitcoin has been going strong for four years, it would be against our best interests not to try and improve upon it when new data becomes available.

People get really emotional when they think their precious status quo is at stake.  Change is scary and some people simply can't handle it.  I feel like anybody that honestly agrees with the beanie babies comment is either jealous that they missed the boat, and/or too stubborn to take a step back and realize that bitcoin could be a real game changer.  It's much easier to attack something you don't understand than to admit that you don't understand it (and then actually put forth effort TO understand it).

Check out page 6 of [this paper](  I haven't read it too closely and it's slightly outdated (October 2012), but I think that's what you're asking about.  Still pretty interesting stuff, I know I would love to see some updated statistics.
