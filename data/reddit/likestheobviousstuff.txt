I hate to single out anyone, because you all are amazing,  but I'd really like to thank for his kind words,and advise.  Honestly wish I could thank everyone individually but im on my phone and my thumbs would be bleeding by the end.

The mods removed did because I gave my email in the tread thinking I was responding to a messages several times.. I broke reddit rules they are justified in being removed.

I even said I posted my email that's why it was removed im not trying to make the mods of the sub look bad I love the sub. I think you were more then helpful. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 04:13:00
I didnt mean it that way. When I said ruin I meant how you mentioned that it could cause dishonest people over run the sub.
