Central bankers can short a future ( isn't that a kind of derivative ? ) as much as they want ? The Bitcoin price is dictated by actual holders. So ... as long as Bitcoin is not entirely held by bankers .. we should be fine :) ?

Why is this a problem since these speculators are not actually holding Bitcoin ? We should be more wary of bankers buying out large amounts of the actual Bitcoin... I guess they'd have to print a lot of FIAT to do this  tough ...

Can Kraken also reimburse people who's deposits were blocked on route to MTGOX, never reached the exchange and remained in the Polish bank. And then when the payouts were calculated, these creditors were left without compensation.
And maybe reimburse all creditors ? These money is not MTGOX's or whoever manages it, to keep.

There is articles Russia wants to legalize it, but if you read carefully  "legalize" means take full control of it. Including preventing trade outside of licensed places. The war with the system is in full force.

Are the US and China gonna follow once they are ready to "regulate it " and can crypto survive in the "resistance".

You touch Bitcoin, they will touch you.

That is what I think.  This is border-line mind monitoring and control.

If this becomes a mess, the BTC value may sink.
