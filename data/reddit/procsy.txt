If one guy can destroy an asset by talking shit about it, then that's not an asset I want to invest in. Bitcoin has thrived while under far more vicious attacks than this, and this is only one more chapter in a very long book.
These attacks and Bitcoin's stunning popularity shined a bright light on some legitimate issues. Capacity constraints, high fees, untrustworthy exchanges and custodians, etc.
The great thing is that this is all built with open-source software. It's a living, breathing, adapting thing. The issues will get solved and bitcoin will emerge from the fire even stronger and more useful.
It just doesn't happen in a straight line. Prices could bounce back next week or it could take months or even years. We've seen this pattern many, many times.
So bring it on! Attacks only make bitcoin stronger and more resilient. We *need* attacks like this to advance to the next level.

This is for reporting transactions in currency -- green pieces of paper -- not ACH transactions like you'd do to Coinbase.
No need to report ACH transactions of any size, since the regulators already have access to this data through the clearinghouse.

I don't have bank accounts in Japan or Korea.
But arbitrageurs do.
Seems like you could make a good living buying BTC on Bitfinex for $9,800 and selling it on Bithumb for $10,700, pocketing $900.
Keep doing that until the prices equalize.

The value of a thing is not determined by how many dollars "come in".
Let's say you own an apartment building three miles from a subway stop. The building is worth $100 million. It has 100 identical apartments each worth $1 million.
Then the city extends the subway line with a stop in the basement of your building. Suddenly that location is much more desirable.
99 of the apartment owners hodl and enjoy the better connectivity to the city center. But one owner lists her apartment for sale, and the new buyer pays $3 million for it. That's now the market rate for an apartment in your building.
Only $3 million "came in", but your building just gained $200 million in value.
Same thing with Bitcoin. As it becomes more desirable, its value increases, even if the vast majority just hodl.

This formula has proven amazingly accurate over long time periods, but it's not very good month-to-month or even year-to-year.
The formula said Bitcoin would start 2017 at $4885 then increase 120% over the year. But Bitcoin actually started the year at $998 and is currently up nearly 1000% so far.
That means there were *multiple years* when the actual price was far below the formula price. Most people aren't patient enough to ride out multi-year swings.
The price is supposed to double again in 2018. But maybe it'll drop 50% in 2018 and then do another 10x in 2019.
Also, the chart was made before other cryptocurrencies existed. If you include them it actually underestimates what's really happening.

This is true for everything, not just cryptocurrencies.
Apple's market cap is $900B. But if everyone tried to sell AAPL at the same time and reinvest in real estate they wouldn't get $900B.
The value of all housing stock in the US is $30T. But if everyone tried to sell their house at the same time and reinvest in AAPL, they wouldn't get $30T.
The beautiful thing about markets is that there are buyers and sellers at the same time. If all participants are sellers and none are buyers, then there's no market.
So the market cap is meaningful in that it describes the relative size of the market when there are both buyers and sellers.
The market cap tells us that Bitcoin as a whole is worth about 13% of AAPL, and AAPL is worth about 3% of the US housing market.

Futures on BT2 have [traded as high as $1,400](
After the announcement the price dropped to $1.
Unclear why they're now trading for $200, who would buy now?
If traders expected BT2 to replace BTC, then that must have driven BTC prices down somewhat.
What happens to that $1000 per BT2? Does it just disappear? Or does some of it flow back to BTC?

The daily limits only apply to CME contracts, not other exchanges.
So if the price increases more than the limit on other exchanges, then nobody is willing to sell on CME since their price is capped at a lower level.
When nobody is willing to sell, those who are short are unable to buy to cover their short and stop their losses.
This can go on for days, with shorts losing more and more every day, unable to close their positions.
When you buy something, the most you can lose is the amount you invested. But when you sell short, your losses are unlimited.

He's saying the circuit breakers cause the contagion.
Bitcoin goes limit up. Now there are no sellers. So shorts can't cover.
Losses grow, shorts go bankrupt, and now the exchange has to eat the losses.
This affects other commodities, and spreads the contagion to the real economy.
Basically, wild success for Bitcoin is armageddon for everything else.

I think Bitcoin is a Regret Machine. It manufactures regret no matter what you do.
I sold some at $1,300 and I regret it.
I sold more at $4,500 and I regret that, too.
I can't sell any more because I imagine my regret at $40,000.
Congrats to on beating the regret machine. For his sake I hope he doesn't regret this day later.

One solution is to require massive margin on deposit for anybody who wants to sell short. If you want to sell short $1,000 worth of Bitcoin, you have to deposit $10,000 in collateral in case the price rises 10x.
Of course, there's still the risk the price could rise 20x, so it's not completely secure.
The only guaranteed safe way I can think of would be for the CME itself to buy and hold, say, 100,000 BTC. Then it could allow its members to sell short up to that quantity, but no more.

Hope you're right, but probably need to address two things in your model.
First, if the second 13.1 million adds $27k to the price, why didn't the first 13.1 million do the same thing?
Second, if a thing is new and it's only worth $1000 and I spend $500 to buy a 50% share, its price is going to rise a lot.
But if the thing is mature and it's worth $145 billion, and I spend $2000 to buy a 0.000001% share, its price isn't going to move much.
So as a thing gets bigger and bigger, each individual new buyer should have less and less effect on the price.

I used to think so. The talking heads on CNBC are always saying stuff like "take your profits" and "harvest your gains".
But the handful of truly wealthy people I know don't do that. They don't sell after a double or a quintuple. They hold for decades, sometimes generations.
Warren Buffet said, "our favorite holding period Is forever".
He also said, "whoever said you never go broke taking a profit is a fool".
Play money comes from "rebalancing". Real generational wealth comes from holding for a very long time.
I wish I'd understood that before I sold at much lower prices.

Everyone's trading on margin, and the margins are pretty thin.
The CME Group itself does something like $1 quadrillion in notional volume every year, yet their equity is only $20 billion.
Bitcoin's market cap is something like $130 billion. Let's say traders short 20% of that on CME and then the price goes up 1000% like it already did this year.
Then when shorts can't cover, who's gonna come up with $200 billion to cover their losses? That's 10x the entire capital of the exchange.

This might be OK, but the truly paranoid won't do this.
Nobody knows how secure the new wallets are. There hasn't been enough time to study the source code and ensure there are no backdoors. And the people behind the fork haven't proven to be trustworthy.
To keep your bitcoin safe, you need to ensure the private keys in your wallet are safe. If you keep your wallet encrypted and ideally offline, you're safe.
That means it's not safe to just "copy over your bitcoin keys" to the wallet for the new fork. That wallet could steal your private keys and steal your bitcoin.
So here's how to do it securely.
1) Transfer your bitcoin out of coinbase into a Bitcoin Core (bitcoin.org, not bitcoin.com) encrypted wallet you keep locally on your own computer (or better yet, multiple copies offline on multiple new USB drives that have never been used for anything else).
2) Wait for the fork.
3) After the fork, keep waiting at least a week or two more to make it unlikely transactions can be replayed.
4) In Bitcoin Core, make a brand new wallet that doesn't contain your old keys. Transfer your funds from the old addresses in the old wallet to the new addresses in the new wallet. Now the addresses that held bitcoin before the fork are empty, and the new addresses in the new wallet hold your funds.
5) Keep your new wallet encrypted and offline.
6) Now that your bitcoin funds are safe, you can copy the old keys into the forked wallet. The funds you had before the fork in the old addresses will show up there, and you can shapeshift them out of the forked chain back to bitcoin if you wish.

Step 1: Nation acquires 1 million BTC at prices ranging from $50 to $1000.
Step 2: Nation announces that their central bank will hold BTC as foreign reserves and peg their local currency to its value.
Step 3: Bitcoin exchange rate skyrockets to $100,000.
Step 4: Savers of the nation enjoy low prices that keep falling as more countries adopt Bitcoin.
Step 5: Debtors of the nation go bankrupt and start over fresh, wiping out the banks.
Everyone wins!
