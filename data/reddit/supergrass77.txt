The Superbowl analogy is in response to your idea that the US has to always be the number one superpower. People will not watch a rigged game where one team is guaranteed to win because the point of the game is to prove one team is always number one, North Korea ring any bells?  Think of it like the dollar is WWF wrestling and Bitcoin is UFC.  People used to think WWF wrestling and Hulk Hogan were the greatest of all time. Then all of a sudden real fighting came along, the UFC, and in a generation people went away from the pretend stuff in favor of real competition. The bad monetary policies of the central banks and government are going to fail when a better alternative exists. You are watching the race for that happen right now and you are forced to bet on it with what you choose to do with your money

You are confusing a few things. You are stating the role of government but not addressing money policy. You are ignoring the changes to monetary policy that have occured during the history of the United States which then begs the question, which monetary policy during the history of the United States was the best for the citizens? If you have blind faith in the United States Government monetary decisions you really don't care about things like the creation of the Federal Reserve or abandoning a gold standard or the 2008 bailouts. Point there is that US monetary policy is always changing so you have to decide how that impacts your money.  Bitconnect is not Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not code for a Ponzi scheme. While some people may say Bitcoin will replace the dollar reality is it will not. Bitcoin will be competition to the dollar as are other currencies and assets like gold.  Bitcoin is your bet against government spending and increasing money supply. It is not criminal to make that bet and it's not anarchy. You are over simplifying like it's all or nothing.  To the point the US needs to be the number one super power, no, that implies the US needs to lie cheat and steal to rule no matter what. I think to be the number one super power means you earn that position by actually being better.  If the US wants to kill Bitcoin they need a better idea or alternative.  Would people watch the Superbowl if one team was always the champion without winning fair and square? I doubt it. Would Bitcoin exist if the Government bailed out the people in 2008 and not the banks? I doubt it

I don't care what Bitcoin price is but I know government debt and fiscal policy is out of control. Forget that for a minute. More people, not less, are becoming involved with Bitcoin which is why every year it goes up in value substantially.  Governments could kill Bitcoin by eliminating a need for it. Sadly that is not going to happen anytime soon so BTC will hit $100k well before governments eliminate growing deficits

The banks are doomed. Once you and I can transact directly without needing to pay for trust by a third party company that third party is done. 
Banks are going the way of the movie theater and toll booth operators, bye bye. There will be some stall tactics with laws and authority but the race for the future medium of exchange is on and Bitcoin is the birth of that movement. Fiat is dead but like mullets and acid wash jeans it's takes a while for things to go away. Fiat will be here for another 10 years but Bitcoin will be much higher  in value and usage living alongside the new forms of money governments create.

The war over crypto is coming because they know the number of people like you are growing. The battle is over the illusion of freedom and how they can maintain control without making you aware that you are being controlled. They are also walking a tight rope because if they come on too strong too early it will be obvious they are taking away peoples freedom and it will actually make more people buy Bitcoin and cause numerous legal challenges and the law of unintended consequences which they are not prepared for.   They will attempt to manufacture a 9/11 scale event to justify the war on Bitcoin and attempt to sway public opinion against Bitcoin to buy time or fool people into an alternative.  They already use fear tactics like screaming it is mostly used for money laundering, tax evasion, drugs, human trafficking, terrorism and any other evil thing that scares you away. What they are not doing is making a better alternative or changing monetary policy to advance progress for humanity. Bitcoin may not be perfect but it is your vote against endless printing of money by those in power. The more people that buy Bitcoin that do not have criminal intent the weaker they become because they can label you a criminal all they want but truth is you know you are not a criminal and anyone battling the truth is going to lose. 
If people quietly put a small amount of money into Bitcoin to test it for a couple years without selling regardless of the ups and downs it will force this war to play out sooner than later.  They can make Bitcoin illegal or try to tax it to death but the only way for them to kill it is to change their ways and make sound monetary policy. Bitcoin has already won this war but the losers still need some battles to prove to themselves they aren't dead yet.

You are missing it. People have to have faith in their governments money for it to work. Ever heard of a run on the banks? Plenty of countries have lost their citizens faith and had their money become essentially worthless. The Bitcoin made out of thin air argument is just propaganda by those against it. Do you believe Diet Soda makes you lose weight? It says it in the name and says it  has zero calories so it must be true, right? The dollar can and will change at a moment's notice by continued manipulation of money supply by the federal reserve and government growing deficit spending. Bitcoin is the opposite of that, it is the savings account you have been dreaming about because it is not controlled by any individuals, corporation, or governments with  a fixed supply that works directly opposite of current monetary policy. The best part is you get to decide which system you work for, the inflationary Fiat system or the deflationary fixed supply system. You can proudly support your governments valuation of money by staying in cash.

Bitcoins does not have to do anything other than what it says it will do. It does not have to depreciate like your US Dollars that the government you worship intentionally devalues to make you work harder for less which is assuming you aren't a government employee where you benefit from other people working to pay your salary.  If you are a government employee who gets paid from other peoples taxation think of Bitcoin as the place those people put their money to ensure you actually do something of value since you aren't responsible for making the money that pays you.  Bitcoin will easily coexist with the Governments military and assets and the best part is that if the Government prioritized the value of your Dollar there would be no need for Bitcoin.

Reality is that Bitcoin is converting more and more people to believe in it which is why every year it is worth more than the previous year.

Bitcoin is a movement of people choosing to take their money out of a system where those that create money have the power to devalue money for everyone else down stream. It is borderless, unlike cash, it is a world wide movement that in theory eventually could be used anywhere, even where it is considered illegal.  It might not make the world equal however it can become more powerful than elections as it could take the power out of the hands of those that can print money or raise debt ceilings to facilitate never ending government deficits.  It could become the new savings account that people trust more than a third party entity like a bank. It won't provide income by itself but it could change lending which produces income

I agree with everything you said.  Banks will still exist but to me that is like saying Chevy Corvettes still exist after 50 years and will continue to exist. Sure the name still exists but the cars themselves are all different with old ones that are vastly inferior cars worth more dollars than newer ones with decades more innovation, some collectible some not.  Bitcoin could become an aspect of banking in the future. I don't think Bitcoin alone will make a Copernican shift but it could be a major part of one depending on how future monetary policy and innovations play out.   To state it simply the best idea is going to win and Bitcoin's existence and continued growth after never ending relentless attacks is proof that it has validity.

If only a small fraction of the population buy Bitcoin it will easily blow past $100k.  The number of people becoming aware of how Fiat currency really works is slowly growing. There is a long way to go for average people to get it because they are destined to be poor regardless of the bazillion investment opportunities presented in life but the bigger issue is that governments and bankers have this virus that they can't kill. That Virus is the death of Fiat and fractional reserve lending known as Bitcoin.  Nevermind all that just keep buying it because it goes up.

If it were to go mainstream sorta like people trying to join the Airforce after Tom Cruise made the movie Top Gun it could go to a million dollars over night. It really only takes a very small percentage of the population to acquire some Bitcoin for it to be worth millions per coin. It's kind of like becoming a millionaire itself, it's not very hard, it's just a different path most refuse to take.  Most people will never be millionaires because they do not think like millionaires.

Somehow I think the original thread is intended to scare people away from Bitcoin more than educate about paying taxes.  The IRS is not going to waste resources chasing taxes on $1000 annual gains by the vast majority of small time crypto traders.  
You scum that think you can scare people about taxes go push your car to work because that is the equivalent of the IRS auditing and going through all of the processes to confiscate anything, let alone Bitcoin.  
You think the IRS has not learned a lesson from trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip?  They just place liens where they can and hope like hell they can collect.  
You scumbags trying to scare people into thinking the IRS is going to spend tens of thousands of dollars in resources and court costs to collect pennies can go massage your fingers for the time you wasted typing because the wealthy already know how to get past the IRS legally and laugh their asses off at sheep trying to scare sheep with scary stories

No, Bitcoin is sort of the equivalent of Fine Art in terms of market share in the asset universe. There are a small  number of people trading for it. You do not realize how few people own Bitcoin. If 1% (nothing) of the world population of people that can transact dabbled in Bitcoin it would be worth exponentially higher price than it is now.  Bitcoin does not even need regular Joe to go substantially higher. One flaw of the current internet is that it is easy to magnify small voices to appear larger than they really are.  Don't confuse small groups of special interests with truth, Trump never would have won   if the small (and shrinking) world of Media were correct in their messages. 
As cellphone usage increases and technology reaches the masses of people that are not even connected to internet  and Bitcoin continues development that makes it easy to transact (think of Square Cash App allowing people to send Bitcoin to each other followed by other apps integrating) it will go higher.  
Your parents generation will eventually die off and their assets transferred to younger generations some of which will find it's way to Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is growing and not dying like the Banks. Sure the banks will reinvent themselves to be in the middle of transacting but Bitcoin has not only started the innevitable death of Fiat it has forced the world powers to start a race to better money before they collapse or lose leverage.  Unless you think we are going to go backwards with progress I do not see how Bitcoin will not increase adoption.  I do think volatility will be here for the next decade as geopolitical issues move Bitcoin. Once enough people are involved volatility will go away.

How about skipping Universal Basic Income and just offering Universal Health Care for everyone in the country? 
I'm sorry but giving every person $1000 a month is just going to make rents, food, and fuel double overnight amongst a number of other expenses.  To assume prices will stay the same is just plain ignorant. 
People will not be rushing for healthcare other than those that need it.  The economy would improve when people no longer have to file bankruptcy after a medical procedure.

One of the best indicators Bitcoin is going to blast past $20k is that it is holding $10k and nobody even talks about it. All the block chain hype of 2017 and ICO frenzy is over. Bitcoin is quietly kicking ass and taking names as the alts die and the Federal Reserve and goverment are pinning themselves into a corner where they are going issue more debt and more Fiat money.  This year and next year will be great for Bitcoin.  
Once the herd comes back the party will be over until enough of them die out from their poor choices and bad  behaviors.

The Fed and US government are going to go the inflation route by lowering rates and flooding the economy with Fiat.   They are going to try to prop up every failing industry which will outnumber the last recession by a wide margin.   The reason they will opt this route is because taxation is based upon asset prices. A 5% tax on $100000 is $5000 but if that same taxable item (income, property tax, sales tax, any tax) goes to $150000 they now collect $7500. What happens when that $100000 turns into $70000? You are now taking away money from the government.  Bitcoin is going to have massive swings until enough people own it which will eventually make it stabalize.  Once Bitcoin does stabalize it will lose its appeal to speculators but will be a great store of value that will be accepted around the world.

At this point in time your sellers will want Fiat currency. You can convert to cash when ready to purchase.  Converting an appreciating asset to buy a depreciating asset like cash or a car is not a wise move. Have you considered the rate of return on Bitcoin versus a low interest car loan? If you were to finance the car at 5% rate  would your Bitcoin appreciate above 5% a year? Maybe hold the Bitcoin to hedge against your loan. The car is going to lose money no matter what but your Bitcoin might allow you to buy 2 cars in 2 years

Hyperinflation does not effect most peoples wages. It effects the cost of food, energy, imported products.  One common misconception is real estate hyperinflates at the same rate.

Your argument implies that only one kind of person owns Bitcoin, the ones that need to liquidate during recession, which will take the value to $0.  You are ignoring the population that will still have jobs or wealth that disagree with governments/central bankers pumping Fiat into the economy to try to prevent deflation.  The more extreme measures taken to prop up the economy the more likely Bitcoin will continue to gain users and appreciate against government stimulus.  If the Federal Reserve was raising rates to slow the an overheated growing economy with run away inflation Bitcoin might have problems.

I have converted gains to real estate in the past. Real estate is currently too expensive and in a bubble thanks to artificially low rates so I am parking in Bitcoin until a correction in real estate or stocks. If Bitcoin is rising while stocks and real estate crash it will be hard to take money out of Bitcoin as it is much more liquid than real estate. While Bitcoin does not return cashfow like real estate it has more scarcity, can be moved around the world effortlessly, and does not have the running costs such as maintenance, property taxes, and dealing with tenants, down time to sell, etc.   I do diversify though as you need multiple streams of income. Bitcoin is destroying the gains on my other investments so it is hard to look elsewhere when Bitcoin is on a clear path to much higher highs in the near term (1 to 2  years).  When tangible assets go on fire sale I do buy. Whenever Bitcoin went on fire sale I bought.  When the get rich quick dummies come out en masse or the Uber drivers are the experts I sell.

You make a good point about why most people won't ever (in the past or future) buy Bitcoin but you make an assumption that everyone or a large percentage of the population needs to be involved with Bitcoin. If only 1% of the world population bought Bitcoin it would be $1 million. Bitcoin is such a tiny percentage of any asset class that it does not need Average Joe that lives paycheck to paycheck for Bitcoin to exist and rise in value nor will Average Joe take it to zero. No assets are 100% immune to recession as some participants will invariably have to liquidate in recession times.  Bitcoin is the bet against or hedge to the banking system or governments deficit spending continuously devaluing currencies.

I remember when Bitcoin hit $100 and was determined to put $500 in to it for the hell of it. I couldn't figure out how to buy it and just gave up. One of the many times laziness has cost me dearly.  I joined Coinbase in January of 2017 but could not get through account verification by scanning my ID to fund my account so again I said forget this and watched the mother of all rallies pass me by as I was prepared to invest a lot.  After the crash I finally started buying in 2018 every week from BTC at $7000 down and up to now.   
You may not believe in Bitcoin but you should let that $30 ride a while say 1 to 2 years and think of it as if it was $300000 because rate of return will be the same either way. Only put out what you are willing to lose.

Although the mortgage lending isn't as "loose" as before many will argue that the bailouts for banks just made a bigger bubble. In many respects we are much worse than 2008. If you simply look at last year when the Fed started to raise rates to finally unwind the QE what happened? Everything started to crumble fast and hard. This proved that we are in a massive debt bubble that can only go one way before popping which is lower rates and more stimulus to attempt to keep the game going. There are numerous needles pointing at that bubble ready to pop it such as record student loan debt, record corporate debt, record personal debt, trade war, international markets slowing, real estate prices falling with record low rates, trillion dollar growing deficits, auto loan and credit card defaults rising. One component missing  over the past decade has been rising wages and growing prosperity with upward mobility in economic class. If you surveyed everyone you know would you say people have had major improvements in their income (not debt) over the past 10 years?

The feedback loop you speak of is scaring people away from Bitcoin, particularly the ones that stand to benefit the most from it.  The only aspect of speculation that is relevant is user activity however growing numbers of users that are not speculating will just as easily support the value.  The big picture is that Bitcoin works and every passing day is further proof.  Now it just needs time for more and more people to learn what it is. Each and every new user will take away from the supply of 21 million coins.  It will do just fine without get rich quick speculators.

BTC will save some but for most it will be too late once inflation arrives. People will always say they missed out and that BTC is too expensive never understanding how it works. BTC only needs to continue it's current growth trajectory of users to reward HODLers very well in the coming years.  A recession is going to force some to liquidate

Here's some reasons
Recessions are inevitable and this next one has the makings of a worldwide massive recession.  It is also overdue so the next one will likely be big.  Banks and goverment are going to try to print their way out. Bitcoin is the only alternative to Central Banking.  Most people don't care about that but most should. The more people that get involved the more innovations that can come to the space which make it easier for everyone to use. A Sound money system will reduce a lot of the problems we know today and bring back the middle class.

Your cause and effect are wrong. The economy is driven by how people make their money not how they spend their money and certainly not how they invest in stocks.  Their decisions are based upon the realities of their income situations. If your income is increasing or stable with good reason to believe it is secure then no amount of recession talk is going to change your behavior. In response to buying and selling stock, it's really simple, nothing increases exponentially in a linear direction forever. Stock prices are not based on feelings, they are based on measurable performance and guidance by real companies that either are generating growing returns or not. Business cycles do come to an end and corrections have to happen to have a healthy economy.  There is a reason Warren Buffett is sitting in cash and it's not because of fear or old age. The market is due for a correction irregardless of where you are in your personal getting rich plan.  
Did the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which caused the market crash, cause the recession? If investors held their Lehman Brothers stock and any other bank that failed and no market crash occurred would the recession have been avoided? If all of the investment banks holding garbage mortgage loans that blew up the economy in 2008 were saved by the government behind closed doors where the general public never knew about it would the recession of 2008 have been avoided? 
Consider the fact that real money already enjoyed a long 10 year run in the market and sees slower growth coming. Real Money is moving away from risk to stay alive.  FUD and FOMO does not apply to real money but does apply to small time speculators.

I am a Bitcoin supporter and own a fair bit of it but your argument doesn't hold water. Take everything you wrote and replace the word "Bitcoin" with "baseball cards" and tell me if it makes sense.  Bitcoin is volatile because so few people own or use it. Many of the current owners of Bitcoin are simply daytraders. Bitcoin needs more organic growth by HODLers and developers like Square that move progress and adoption forward. The moves by speculators are not helping Bitcoin progress instead it is scaring away the ones that stand to benefit the most by owning Bitcoin.

I understand they limit withdrawal amount however do they restrict how much Bitcoin you can sell for USD? If you can sell it all can't you just withdraw the USD over time?
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:55:00
While I wish I controlled the price of Bitcoin the only things I control are when I buy and sell. I think you are trying to say do not sell at a loss and just HODL instead. A more effective way to increase adoption would be to spread the word about CashApp and convey the message to millions of people to take Bitcoin for a test run and buy $20 of Bitcoin and HODL to see if you get scammed or lose all your money. If neither happens and it goes up in value people will know how to park money in something potentially better than any bank account.

All of your points are downstream of the larger factors of importance.  The foundation of the economy is built upon basic human needs so most jobs are related to these such as food, shelter, health care, transportation, etc.  Stock investors are not the economy and will not create a recession especially if they cash out at the top of the market and move into bonds as they are currently doing in record numbers. Although emotions can move stocks short term the fundamentals will always be at play and ultimately dictate value.  Your Elon Musk example is bad because Tesla stock has been wildly overvalued for a long time so naturally gravity will pull a stock like that down on any bad news.  Google is getting sued and investigated left and right, why is that stock not falling apart?  Warren Buffett represents real money, money that actually moves markets, Buffett does not like losing money and Buffett knows when to buy. Buffett is not buying in this environment and is in cash waiting for the opportunity to buy.  Why?


You still have your cause and effect wrong.  Smart money is already cashed out my friend which is why something called negative yields and negative interest rates are a reality today. Real wealth is already shielded and that same money will go back into stocks and other investments when the time is right. You said "Less money being invested is less money being made" which is not true.  Assuming you are referring to stock investment, this is not what fuels the economy, the underlying companies are competing for dollars in the real world.  If you are referring to general investment, business owners will invest when they know they will get a return. Investors are not buying real estate to rent out at the current prices, home flippers can't turn profits at current prices, auto sales are declining, personal debt is at an all time high as is corporate debt. Record numbers of store closures have been continuing. Many companies bought back their own stock instead of investing in growth, they do not do that if the economy is really growing. The current talk is that the US is the least worse economy therefore investment will flow into the US. Reality is the market is due for a major correction and evidence shows it is underway.  My advice is to get into cash or shield your wealth.  Losing 15% upside is better than taking a 30% to 50% hit to the downside. If you are in cash and you make the recession happen as you believe you will be ready to buy up assets cheap alongside Warren Buffett.

The get rich quick people are not helping Bitcoin. Pumpers and scammers are actually slowing progress as they are the equivalent of people getting in the fast lane on the highway and driving slow just so they do not have to be stuck behind someone else.  They are the problem and no part of the solution.
Bitcoin is not a penny stock and it does not need pumpers. It could use more people educating others on what it is and how to use it.

Once you see what small percentage of the worldwide  population is using or own Bitcoin while watching central bankers increase money supply it is easy to see Bitcoin many many times more expensive in terms of future  Fiat values.  
Once people see the real bubble in fiat and debt the price of Bitcoin will seem incredibly cheap.

While this is pretty euphoric to own and watch huge moves up it would be better to have a steady increase. There is probably a massive short squeeze happening but we need it to hold $7000k for a while to confirm we have bottomed. Going parabolic from a bottom with no news catalyst is just not going to convince people to trust their money in this

Not really. Stock investing is about owning companies. Will companies go away because of Bitcoin? No.  I think you imply money leaves stocks for Bitcoin. Money will chase the highest rate of return at various risk levels and time horizons.

There is no money or advertising revenue in Bitcoin for CNBC. The last thing a stock market channel wants to do is spend 24 hours a day reporting about investments that underperform Bitcoin.  They want their clientele to stay focused on stocks and not distracted by that pesky Bitcoin that never goes away
