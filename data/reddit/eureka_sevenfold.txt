I like how people said that Bitcoin is a bubble to all the naysayers get fuck only if I knew about Bitcoin a year or 2 ago before I found out about it I could have been a millionaire

lol the George Soros of the world and other people like him as paying a lot of money to prevent Bitcoin to be mainstream this just means Bitcoin or some form of Bitcoin is going to be the future of currency I hope Donald Trump starts talking about this kind of stuff

The Washington Post is a pile of shit in my opinion the best media comes from the Independent media now I agree Genesis Mining is probably shit they're going to probably do like mount gox but there may be some system that may be useful in the future of this type of currency that is why you're seeing paid shills to dinner great this company

when I see Bitcoin prices go up I usually attributed that to the world economy and maybe getting unstable we might start to see fiat currency start to fall the world leaders is trying to hold on to fiat currency all their might but the cracks are starting to show it's just a matter of time

well thanks for that that is basically how the establishment media acted I can say Bitcoin may drop down in price because multi-billionaires that are in the government are taking their money out of Banks and stock and putting in Bitcoin because because they know The Jig Is Up because a lot of the multi-billionaires is basically criminals and when the public finds out they're going to lose everything but this is not a understatement of Bitcoin because some form of Bitcoin will be the future of currency Bitcoin may have to be sacrificed to accomplish this and it may take a while to get the public back interested in cryptocurrency but it will happen again
