Here we go:

For mass adoption, learning bitcoin-qt is not reasonable because it is not designed for laymen. Imagine if using the internet required knowing how to configure tcp/ip settings. That's why we have layers on top of the core technology (services like Circle) to make it easier for people.

Because it's virtually unusable to people who don't know what Bitcoin is.

This was written as one unit, with each point elaborating on the previous. 86 words. Nothing about "open source" software, as that means nothing to the layman.
* Bitcoin is internet-based money that can be transferred instantly, anywhere, for free.
* The network consists of everyone who runs the Bitcoin software.
* It is the first currency in history to be managed collectively by its users, and not a central authority.
* Transactions are recorded in one enormous public ledger that every user's computer must agree on, in order to be valid.
* Because of this and other security features, and it is impossible to counterfeit Bitcoin.
* There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoins in existence.

Is this statement accurate: "All bitcoin transactions will eventually get confirmed unless it is part of an unsuccessful double spend attempt."

More power to you. I have no idea what that means but I'm still able to access the web.

Expecting the masses to adopt pure Bitcoin and knowing their private keys is like expecting people to run their own email servers back in the 90s. Sure it may be way better for techies and the anti establishment folks, but it has a long way to go until the layman adopts the technology. It's less important to educate people on the technology, and more important to provide them with tools, language, and wallets that are friendly and usable. My mom doesn't need to know about http to use Chrome. With Bitcoin, we are a long way from an adoptable user experience. And that's fine because we're still in the early days. So I may sound like a shill for saying this, but companies like coinbase and needing to "trust" centralized companies are necessary. They will be the bridge between technology and the rest of those who could care less about what the blockchain is.

An app may be user friendly but I'm more referring to the entire experience. This includes things that aren't yet seamless, like understanding how much they have in terms of value, having to find where Bitcoin is accepted, and the idea of being identified by cryptic wallet address and qr codes.

Very interested. Crypto needs UX desperately.

Using words regular people are familiar with... it's a personal account containing your money. But it's not registered through PayPal or any bank or any single app.

I make fonts! Lemme at it. What's the which unicode slot should the symbol be in?

Lucky you, we had friends who started the IVF route and ended up not needing to. Not for us though, but no regrets :)

We've dealt with infertility for the past few years and last year finally decided to cash out some of it to pay for IVF treatments. And my little one was just born a few days ago. Thanks Satoshi!

Technically some older doctor guy impregnated her. Funny story - when my mom (Asian) found out we did IVF she confused it with using a sperm donor and her first question asked "Is the guy white?"
