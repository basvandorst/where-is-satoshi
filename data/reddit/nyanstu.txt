It did both. Earlier this year it was instrumental in inflating the Gox price; a few weeks ago it was very clearly put into reverse, ultimately magnifying the crash by at least several times in my opinion.

The trading bot AKA Willy was simply so obvious, I cannot believe some of the commentators are pulling the "innocent until proven guilty" card. From the first day I began trading I was always thinking "what are they going to make it do next" on Gox and no such thoughts on the other exchanges, because when the bot kicked in it was so easy to spot. 
And of course it was Mark's bot. Considering it's behaviour and the ridiculous effect it had on prices over the last few months (the Gox premium and then the ultimate crash) any straight exchange operator would have cut the API to the bot controller long, long ago.
Of course none of this stopped me personally from being a jackass and keeping my funds on Gox for too long :)

Could you please tell me what info is included in the btc_xfer_report.csv?
For some reason I cannot open it.

Is it in the best interests of those who made deposits to Gox in the last few days before it closed on 25 February to file a criminal complaint against Gox claiming that the company continued to accept user deposits when knowingly insolvent? 
In this case should those filing the criminal complaint aim to recover losses through means outside of any bankruptcy process or civil rehabilitation process?

I want to put my name to this. I am afraid I do not have the time to help on a daily basis but count me in. Could I ask one of you - Daniel or Project Gox - to set up an e-mail address specifically for those wanting to sign up. I suggest you use it only for that reason given that over the coming weeks you may get thousands of messages. In fact much better still set up a web page form for the sole purpose of gathering a mailing list of those who want to be involved. Consider carefully the exact info you require: name, e-mail address, Gox account number, funds trapped, etc. Maybe [–]withaminutetogo would have some suggestion here? To save a whole lot of time obviously all this info needs to be saved into a database and you need to look at making a privacy statement. I'm really sorry I cannot help further but there's my first idea for you! :)

You don't need a well-reasoned argument to know when you've been Goxed.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:04:06
If this process is following the Gox code for loading the hot wallet, then can anyone say at what point the splitting up should stop?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:29:10
"500 million lost? IMPOSSIBILE!!! :(" etc...
They were lost or stolen in 2011 when they were worth much, much, much less.
Mark thought it wasn't so bad and Gox would come through...
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:54:05
Give Gox another few weeks to respond clearly regarding withdrawals and then decide whether or not to launch action.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:15:59
Thanks for putting the effort into this Daniel.
Could I ask, are you gathering names / e-mail addresses of those who would like to be involved in developing this idea?
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:50:42
Thanks for the insight!
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:38:39
The bot was instrumental to both the high and low prices. It was unmissable to anyone with half a brain who watched the charts regularly.
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:55:57
I don't know how to map out these movements, but if someone could put this work up on a simple web-page that is kept updated, then the web-page address can be passed on to the supervisor in charge of managing Gox. The call centre representative I spoke to told me they can pass messages back to the supervisor and investigators. Is anyone able to do this?
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:58:29
Can someone tell me if this is as definitive a thread gathering info about Gox wallets as exists? I have come across several already.
For me this info fits best with the theory that Gox cold wallets have been under the control of the USG for a while now.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:36:06
Now things get interesting, because although the current theory is that investors refused the business plan, it would be foolish to imagine that there was no arbitration going on during the Gox crash. It might well be that some insiders got their hands on tens if not hundreds of thousands of cheap Bitcoin* and then ran for the hills, leaving a big deficit on the books.
*EDIT: from people not in-the-know panic-selling for huge losses.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:40:31
Thanks. What is different about your data that makes you think it is not publicly identifiable compared to some others' data, then? Thanks for your explanations.
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:33:46
Great analysis Kometes.
May I suggest that you send this (perhaps minus the "screw it!" end theory) to the Japanese authorities? You could get a lead on exactly who to get it to by asking quesitons via the hotline that should come into action tomorrow:

Yep, looks like a mess.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:31:46
Really don't know what to say about this guy. Whatever the real story turns out to be, whatever the extent TBI has been used by insiders/others, whatever comes to light... the one thing I feel for sure is that he exudes the mentality of an internet troll. Put that together with real information + half-truths + propaganda + personal agenda = who knows? :(
If this is how we start I think 2014 is the year the Bitcoin community gets fractured, by chaos or by some ulterior intent  (government intervention??).
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:00:55
Have you also read this thread:
Could you put the web-page together? Unfortunately I have zero skills in that area.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:36:04
There was rampant insider trading - but it's also important to use the term market manipulation. I am not sure how long it will take for this to be phased out but now that Gox is gone it can only wane in my opinion.
That said the price won't be going past the ATH for at least a year now I think.
@_date: 2014-03-07 11:52:54
I don't know how to map out these movements, but if someone could explain in a few lines what is happening, with links to the relevant blockchain pages, and put this on a simple web-page that is kept updated, then the web-page address can be passed on to the supervisor in charge of managing Gox. The call centre representative I spoke to told me they can pass messages back to the supervisor and investigators.

Not only is the document fake but how could such a pathetic attempt at a real-looking business plan have been confirmed by several people as you claim Two-Bit Idiot. 
I don't believe your story at all.
Disclosure: I have no BTC or USD with Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:10:25
Movement in this case would mean between two parties. Gox moving coins around from address to address within their control does not count as movement.
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:07:18
You are a troll twobitidiot!
Are you one of the GCHQ trolls we've been reading about recently?
Seriously though, I ask this of you:
1. Look for evidence that potential investors were already buying cheap Bitcoins on Gox. If you have proper evidence and a source you can refer to, publish this. This I agree is corrupt.
2. If you find that Bruce Fenton or anyone else wanted to bail out Gox but didn't get to the arbitrage stage, leave them alone: THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A BAIL OUT, idiot.
3. If you find that your current sources, who remain hidden, or big players whom you respect, whom you work for, or who have told you to keep quiet, have been corrupt, REPORT THEM, because otherwise you are just a biased coward.
Thank you in advance for your honesty and integrity.
@_date: 2014-03-07 12:45:52
nullc could I ask, would you be prepared to summarize what you think is likely going on here? I mean in simple terms such as:
180k Bitcoins being transferred from 5 suspected Gox wallets (with 99% probability that they are Gox wallets either controlled by Mark Karpeles or by someone who has gained access to the keys) to such and such addresses. And give links to the blockchain pages or other pages that illustrate your summary.
I would like to put this information onto a web-page, the address of which I will pass on to the court-appointed supervisor in charge of Gox. While I would like to believe that someone authoritative in Bitcoin analysis is working closely with the Japanese authorities there has been no public sign of this happening.

Bitcoin Jesus might be a charitable man but he also loses big bets... don't know if that helps or not.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:57:07
I'm sure they have more than 180k btc. It doesn't make any sense at all that they would load their entire stash into the hot wallet. They control much more and I hope in our misery and frustration we don't slip into acknowledgement of the 180k btc figure left as being everything.
But whether we will get it back or not is another question...

Paul's tweets on this subject have been going for a couple of days now. I'm not sure the FBI investigation etc. are all part of the takeover plan. With all they hype starting up I think this has to come out fully by the end of the week or it's dead in the water.
