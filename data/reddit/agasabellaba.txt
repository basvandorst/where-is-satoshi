I saw the platform as well 
I'm curious to know the use cases of it (other than wrecking lol)
also, Shadow Trading seems a good idea, although maybe not really on such small and volatile markets?

You should just google this but anyways..
Airdrop is gifting coins or tokens to people. You can do that to increase adoption for example, exchanges do that (see [blockchain.com]( they gave me 50$ worth of Stellar just for registering) , and private companies also, and Bitcoin miners too in the very beginning. BitTorrent for example is a private company owned by Tron project that sent me an airdrop of their token, BTT, just because I owned some Tron at that time. (Tron is to BTT what Ethereum is to AUG or anyother ERC20 token.)  So Bitorrent is doing this to help adoption cause they know they are targeting people who are 20-35 yo, tech savvie etc and thus help adoption of their token. In this last case, the airdrop is particular because it happened on-chain, that is Tron holders didn't have to do anything because they already got an  account on the Tron blockchain that was targeted for the airdrops.  BTW, Bittorrent will continue these airdrops for the next 6 years so you are still in time to get some for free :P
EDIT: wording 
EDIT 2: I hope someone will give you more info about Binance specifically, although you could start reading their FAQ for some clarification
