Just so you know, you are not mining BTC. You are selling your hash power for BTC. I was doing this with Nicehash until someone, likely within Nicehash, stole all of their BTC. Be careful.

Bitcoin mining requires specially built hardware that is expensive and takes some time to become profitable while using a lot of electricity. PC's are not profitable at all because of this. The difficulty of BTC mining has increased this much over it's life span. 
I personally mine ethereum (ETH) as part of a mining pool. I use my Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU to do this. I earned about $40 worth in two weeks of mining overnight and while at work. I have cheap electricity so it doesn't bother me. There are other coins to mine but ETH works best for me. Follow the other links posted in the comments for more info.

Well there was the journalist who researched bitcoin and forgot about them. Saw the price had jumped and cashed out. Made a few hundred thousand.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:49:53
Why does it look shady?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:35
Nicehash shutdown, so you can't connect to their service to mine.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:12
You can move it around on hardware wallets too. If this was stolen, there is no reason for this person to move it much anyway. The heat is too severe. Take it offline and wait. Whoever did this is very smart tech wise and knows what they are doing.

Buy now. If you lose in the short term you will gain in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:49
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:51
Why not? Unless they invested recklessly or have an emergency there’s no need to sell right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:23
That’s not what he was talking about. He was talking about people getting out. And doing that kind of trading is risky. We didn’t know it was going back to 15. It was 12 yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:25
No one is pointing out this is fake? I know some of you got it. But some are getting mad. Look at how sharp the text is compared to the rest of the image and also how the box is lined up with the rest of the graphics. I'm ashamed at how poorly this was done.

Damn that tweet hit me hard. Yeah I have had to buy McDs with quarters and dimes. Being poor sucks. Maybe once I get my EE degree I can sit back and laugh at these times. Or when I have all of my BTC and people are bowing at my feet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:31:54
Well it was my first thought too. A taxi ride is 15-25 bucks and the transfer fee could double that. I'd just use Apple Pay if I could or a Visa.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:40
:( my 12 dollars I've been mining for the past week. I was wondering why the miner stopped working when I left for work.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:44:31
You have never filed your own taxes? Why not? It isn't hard, I've been doing mine since I turned 18 and I'm not exactly a smart man.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:24:50
Along with the key?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:06:10
Man this thing is climbing again. It's fun!

14k boi
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:39
If you robbed a bank for millions, would you spend it right away? No. Good way to get caught. They can transfer the btc from one wallet to another and sit on it for a bit. If they sell it for cash it can be hidden. It's not that hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:33:56
What do you expect to happen when something’s value doubles and triples? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:58:59
I'll buy them all.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:56:36
Well he could just transfer his BTC straight to GDAX. Once verified on coinbase you’re good on both. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:15
I saw that too. I want my $12 back.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:10
MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEEEEEEEEEEY
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:08:02
Me too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:20
Because each exchange has people buying and selling at a certain price point. They aren’t all connected. Generally though they are pretty close. But may lag when they are on the rise. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:26:04
Wanna join?  ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:09
Yes but not the person's ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:22
Price goes up and so does the amount of transactions that need to be verified. So it slows down. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:40:57
Yawwwwwwwn... 
The moon is still a ways off.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:57
It hit over 18k

Fuck off I'm not a shill, I just use shitty terminology because I ain't too smart.

Your address isn't usually linked with your name. They can move from one wallet to another with ease.
Could be this guy: 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:34:08
Why would they covert? They have earned 3 million dollars since this was deposited. And if they did sell, they could do it in small amounts. Or buy valuable things with it. It is pretty hard to track if they aren't stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:45
For like a minute. Then it crashed. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:22
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:36
The problem is for people who have only mined small amounts, the TX fee is too high to move them offline.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:55:15
The same can be said about Andreas here. People are literally giving him money because he preaches Bitcoin.

European countries often have GFCI all over the house, not just the bathroom like in the US.

Ha, yeah right. I'll eat 5 pounds of sausage biscuits if it does.

December 17, 2017. Makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:18:11
It’s the way we say the date. December 17th, the arrangement of month and day really doesn’t matter. But it flows more naturally to say the month because that narrows down the time of the year instantly. 17 doesn’t mean anything to me right away. But if someone says December first I know instantly what time of year and then will know the day right after that. Although I like metric units over our Imperial system, I’m perfectly fine with our date format. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:35
I built my PC a year ago, started mining in Dec 16. I had about 0.04 BTC.
And I sold it. 
Now I'm starting over, bought in at 10,308. 
Damn it, but WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:17:34
Smells like BS to me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:30:45
Shit I have to work in the morning, to get more dollars, to buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:28:37
Hugo Stiglitz would be ashamed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:36:58
I played with this last year and sold out to get some needed money back. 
Just bought 0.01BTC and I'm already in a profit. So do it. If I had bought $100 worth back then and kept it, I'd feel really good right now.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:33:03
Same. Blocked and reported.

And the true comedy of Dumb and Dumber is that they are just completely ignorant on an impossible functioning level.

Only an idiot would sell at 7k after losing that much value. Assuming it was investment money and not needed money.

Los Alamos From Below - 
Fun to Imagine (my favorite) - 
Youtube will suggest many more from those but these two are pretty good.

Feynman is so sassy in that part. He can’t help it. For most people it’s enough to understand the effects of magnetism. For seriously inquisitive people we have to dig further. Magnetism, like electricity happens on a very small level with things that we can’t record with video. It’s like most people know that Salt is spread on the road to keep ice from forming. Most people don’t know why that works on a molecular level. 
I’m not sure if you have seen them but Feynman has many lectures on YouTube including one describing his time working on the Manhattan project.
