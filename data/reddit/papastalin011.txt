hi, im a fellow newbie in similar position. before you send your coins to paper wallets, please make sure you understand how bitcoin change address works. I did not understand it personally fully, but i understood there is a possibility to loose your money when you try to spend from a paper wallet.
please read this
personally i decided to use a HD wallet instead of paper wallets due to not understanding this problem. wish you all the best

is there an option that instead of online mycelium app requesting 2nd key, you would just scan a signed transaction qr code from an offline device running also mycelium. that way 2nd key would never touch the internet? im the total newb so sorry if this is stupid, i just have an idea in my head what seems logically to be more secure.

A very nice feature of Mycellium is that you can export the xpub master address to your everyday phone with mycellium app, and than use it to receive bitcoin, check balance,  etc.
If you do not intend to spend from cold storage for years to come, you can completely wipe the offline phone.

had a very pleasent experience with mycelium last night. im excited as some schoolboy :) 
Wanted to prepare for buying my first significant amount of coins. sure its just 0.5tbc, but i feel proud and excited!
so what i did was to format an old android phone, install mycelium and disable wifi. than i created a new hd wallet, backed it up ofc, than exported xpub key to my regular online device running mycelium as well. that lets me receive coins to the cold storage wallet, and see the balance at all times. after that i formatted my old phone just in case, since i intend to save these coins for some time. 
process was easy, maybe could be more intuitive if there were additional tooltips when playing with export import options. but overall, havent found a wallet more user-friendly than mycelium. 
sincere ty to the guys&amp;girls making it.

can You please confirm if debit cards from Serbia (south-eastern Europe) are accepted? (just the regular visa i use on any online webstore such as ebay, paypal, so on)

recommend this route also! i took my wife's old phone, factory reset, install mycelium, disable networks. than generate a new seed, back it up, generate a xpub address so i can watch only the funds. factory reset the phone again. than i just import the xpub into my regular phone's mycelium app for watch only ability.

hi, could someone please explain how does the option to import watch only HD account work?
i was thinking about buying 0.5btc for the first time, and understood that cold paper wallet is actually what is recommended for larger investments. but than i read about dangers of using normal paper wallets, due to change address feature. And that if i want to invest this much money, it is better to do it on HD account. 
So, my question is where can i create HD paper wallet, and how exactly do i import it into watch only mycelium.
please forgive noob question, its just not exactly easy to figure everything out on my own.

can someone please help me out. i reset my phone, and now  just cant remember how to add a watch only cold storage HD account from an offline phone running mycelium, over to my regular phone. ty

My understanding (admittedly an average one) of the economics forces, leads me to believe wealth distribution would increase immensely a few generations after bitcoin becomes a dominant currency.
The way i see it, the main reason wealth is so centralized currently is due to those on top being able to print/create money out of thin air, and also due to being able to get the state to forcibly redistribute wealth (in their favor usually).
Without those mechanisms available with bitcoin (cant create it, and cant confiscate it), IMHO we will notice a very strong wealth decentralization effect of the free market. Just remember the old saying "from shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations".
I'm certain that spoiled, no work habit, lazy children of future btc trillionaires will be separated from their wealth very efficiently in the decades to come.

English is not my native tongue, but the way i understand this saying, by shirt sleeve it is implying a regular working man, pulling back his sleeves so to say, in order to do a proper job. A man striving to succeed, make a better life for himself.
The saying, in a few words manages to paint a great truth in life, that only through struggle do we learn to appreciate fruits of  labour. Our children, if given everything on a silver platter, will lack this appreciation and sooner or later squander the wealth.

Ty everyone, looks like bither and electrum mobile apps can do this. I have checked out bither google play store page, and it is specifically stated in the readme notes. Will have to install it and see how it compares to mycellium in other aspects. Fingers crossed.
Electrum doesnt mention this feature in the readme notes, will have to install it and see for myself.
Though im not sure why most wallets dont offer this feature as standard? Seems to me its a very convenient system to transfer funds from cold storage safely.
