Currencies have been deflationary before, such as during the Great Depression, the Panic of 1907, the Panic of 1857, etc, for example. When debts and obligations evaporate, the supply of money declines drastically due to bankruptcy, deflating the money supply and causing hard cash to rise in value.
People tend to hoard the currency and not spend it... that is the observed behavior, which causes further deflation, because money supply is generally defined as money * velocity of money. (A moving coin can satisfy many different debts and obligations as it goes from one person's hand to another, if it is still, and not in circulation, it does not have this potential).

I was just saying, that saving energy, or work, or oil, or goods, is a legitimate economic activity, but saving bit coins is not truly saving: the statistic just shows a lack of demand for bit coins.

This implies the value of bitcoins versus other currencies cannot go up much. Should bitcoins take a price rise versus other currencies, there are a lot of bitcoins under the mattresses to emerge and bring the price back down again.
Of course, these other bitcoins might be on discarded, broken computers.

No. 14 percent of gold is traded in London. Wikipedia says "Although the physical market for gold and silver is distributed globally, most wholesale OTC trades are cleared through London. The average daily volume of gold and silver cleared at the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) in November 2008 was 18.3 million ounces (worth $13.9 billion) and 107.6 million ounces (worth $1.1 billion) respectively. This means that an amount equal to the annual gold mine production was cleared at the LBMA every 4.4 days, and to the annual silver production every 6.2 days.[1]. The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee claims that clearing data substantially understates the true amount of gold traded, due to the netting of trades in the calculation of Clearing Statistics.[2] They claim the LBMA market is $5.4 trillion a year.[3]"
  
To me it sounds like a lot of gold is trading.

Hence it is not inflationary and much less useful as a currency, since it will tend not to circulate and be hoarded.

Yes they can. If I loan you a bitcoin, and you buy a car, and then the car dealer loans me the bitcoin by depositing it in my bank (since I run a bitcoin service), then I have the same bitcoin I loaned you, but I loan it out again. If bitcoin were truly a currency it would circulate like this, being represented on many people's accounts as debits or credits. One bitcoin, if it circulated enough, could represent hundreds of bitcoin of 'money', that is assets or liabilities on balance sheets. The velocity of money (how many times the same currency unit moves over time) is the surest representation of inflation there is.
But right now bitcoin won't be used as currency, lending and depositing of bitcoins is uncommon, so it's just a trading unit. And the defect of bitcoin is during a bank run people can't create the money to prevent a super crash as all that 'money' evaporates as debts don't get paid.

The ability of a small number of owners to control the price declines the more owners there are, so maybe volatility would go up as adoption increases.

That was true, until it turned out that bitcoins could be tracked.  I hear such purchasers have switched to Monero instead.

Cheap?  Maybe a different currency but not bitcoin

Yes, it has no underlying usefulness.

Question: Is bitcoin fiat money?
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:28:39
How many kilowatts did that transaction take?
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:13:27
Bitcoin is no currency. It would need to have smaller transaction fees, use less electricity, supported by many retailers, and be inflationary, and be uniquely useful (like to pay taxes).... all things it doesn't have.

Invest in what? If your business requires sales, and everyone is hoarding and no-one is buying, why should you invest in a way to sell more?
Money is truly valueless, it's just a way to make people in society work to provide for each other, hoarded cash does not represent investment, it is just sitting there. It represents future claims on society's resources, and it can grow. Should all that sitting cash suddenly release itself you'd get tremendous inflation.
This is exactly what happened during the gold standard in the US: periods of extreme inflation and loose money followed by periods of extreme deflation and bankruptcies.
It's not good to accumulate all claims on society's future production in vast pools of speculative commodities.

Well, the entire Visa system uses less proportionally per transaction much less energy than bitcoin, and that includes bankers jetting off to conferences, which they would still do if they lent out bitcoin instead of currency. The cost per transaction for the security cryptopuzzle is just too high.

Leave off the personal attacks, you obviously don't read my posts since you are asking these questions. I determined the cost for processing 1.06 billion transactions in bitcoin, and then compared that to the TOTAL WORLD generation, which is less. The banking sector is smaller than the total world generation, that's a given. I suppose I could try to figure out what portion of the world's energy goes to banking vs manufacturing vs farming vs mining, but it's irrelevant, since the bitcoin use would be larger than ALL OF IT.  So that's why it doesn't matter. Please read the post before you criticize and start attacking.
And layer 2 is just accumulating transactions together and running them at once, which has to be done by someone you can trust, so it's just banking by another name.
Note I added an edit in my previous comment where I got the figure for world energy use, not just world electrical energy use. Bitcoin to process 1.06 billion transactions is still greater than that.

Useful for what?
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:16:13
Yeah they can. They used to do that with gold bars. Remember bank accounts are not money, they are just debt obligations. Debt measured in bitcoin can be traded as future bitcoins and could cause inflation... until the inevitable bank run which becomes more of a problem, like it was under gold.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:28:29
Well I guess I suck because I had to pay $14 on a 400 transaction
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:40:34
It doesn't matter. The math does not lie. They can't possibly be using more than 20,000 terawatts for the banking industry because that's the WORLD ELECTRICAL GENERATION MAXIMUM. And if those same transactions were in bitcoin, you'd have to use more than 10 TIMES MORE THAN THE WORLD MAXIMUM to validate all the transactions.
Ergo, the banking industry, per transaction, is cheaper than bitcoin. They may charge you more though since they can.
Edit: Also, do you think if those people weren't employed as bankers they'd still own houses and cars and travel or would they just magically disappear?
Edit2: Total world energy use, including transportation and other fossil fuel burning, is 142.3  * 1000 Terawatts (in 2008). This is still less than the amount of energy you'd need to process all the bitcoin transactions if all banking transactions were in bitcoin, and that figure includes refining costs too.

 As per Satoshi's own design for Bitcoin the difficulty of mining is coded-in to the system to require more and faster CPU power as the blockchain gets bigger longer. (read the Satoshi paper to understand!)
Right now it costs up to 450 Satoshis per byte or around **261kWh** of electricity to confirm EACH transaction, or about US $28 worth of power in the cheaper power countries (like China and Canada) and there are around 2600 transactions per 1 MB block in the blockchain every ten minutes. 
2600 transactions per ten minutes is tiny in the banking sceme of things. In banking, according to CapGemini/RBS World Payments Report, there are 1.06 billion movements per day in the banking system.
If each transaction in the banking system cost cost 261KWh, like each transaction in bitcoin, then the banking system would use **261,000 terawatts a day.**
Total WORLD electrical generation is **20,000 terawatts**. This is a lot less than the cost of running those 1.06 billion  banking transactions as if there were bitcoins.
So unless the banking system has secret Star Trek dilithium crystals somewhere generating power from antimatter, you can easily see that per transaction the cost of bitcoin is extremely much more than the cost of the regular banking system.
So here is my proof.

Better than bitcoin.

What is the cost per transaction of a bit coin?
It's not just doing the transaction.
It's also having proper security on your hard disk, insurance in case the coins get stolen, and the like.
I think the cost might be too high for these small businesses of yours that can't handle the bureaucracy of Visa/Mastercard.
