For those of us in apartment or other places where it's included and we don't care about the environment, doesn't matter.
source: have two gaming rigs mining away paying for that $450 GPU I bought. Should be covered by summertime.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:03
The crash will start at 10:57pm UTC on the 9th of December and will bottom out at $3867.89 USD, and the correction will level out between $4891-$5762 within the next 78 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:20:33
okay sir your request will be quickly process shortly
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:49:04
Yeah I see what you are saying now as well lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:05
You haven't profited anything if you are only referring to hourly changes of a very volatile currency.

To transfer *to* GDAX or out of GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:46:15
That tx wouldn't have any effect on market price unless someone saw it on the chain, thought it was weird, and put a buy/sell order for a *lot* of btc for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:38
Omg guys [I already answered this](

I'm a huge car guy, but I am not, and most likely will never, be at a place in my life where I am willing to spend tens of thousands just for a couple years of ownership of a car. I'll stick to used cars where I can recoup most of my spent money by doing maintenance myself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:30


Oh, so you didn't actually cash out and you're only "ahead of your loans" in your imagination.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:06:30
Only while you're in school and for a short grace period afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:22:27
Nope, no pug.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:04:08
Please don't be rude.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:14:56
Good on you for setting up a plan to actually cash out some of it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:31
RemindMe! 3 days
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:01:57
It is less accessible and more work to get it to fiat, that's my understanding of the situation
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:05:19
So who designs and oversees the robots?
I design automotive tooling. The current state of the industry is *far* from having robots design, make, and install this stuff.

It's still essentially worthless to them if they can't spend it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:34:18
idk man I'm just the future-predicting bot don't ask me questions like that bro

Yes, a hot wallet transaction requires that the software processing the transaction has access to the keys.
A cold wallet has never been exposed to the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:44
Nope haha just a lover of dogs and came up with a funny name to annoy my even more loving of dogs gf lol

Coinbase gave me a small amount of BTC for a referral. It would take 99% of that amount ($18 CAD at this time) in fees to transfer it out.
As long as Bitcoin looks like that to the general uninformed public, people will only see it as an asset, not a currency.

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:04
I'm hourly so at forty hours a week it's less, that's just the rate I average. I accepted lower pay for flexibility though and do not regret it
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:13
k thx and plz send ur verification email address so I can be sure to send to the right email for the maximum security of your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:24:38
And where are the keys to those wallets stored?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:45
Why are you setting a reminder for an hour from now?

There's something to be said for being debt free. Circumstances can change. If you've been hodling for even only a year or two and can sell some to pay off debt, get it done. It's a volatile market and no one knows what will happen in the next two weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:21
Yeah but if you do that, you have your future after that pretty  much sorted out. Otherwise you wouldn't pay that much... right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:31
Crash earlier today?
It's still down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:16:25
It's tongue in cheek. I'm just always surprised at what some people do.
If you spend $20K/semester on a social sciences degree, for example, you'd damn well better have a plan for how to pay it off.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:16:59
Do you really think that they needed access to over 4500 coins at all times, though?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:22


It's not that deep... you only won't find it if you simply don't search for fees, which, like.. if you don't check the fees, that's 100% on you as it is not an unreasonable amount.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:27
Huh. I assumed, being the same setup, fees to transfer out would be the same
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:17
I mean Coinbase is still down
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:46
You bought and sold enough bitcoin to equal, after taxes, 2.5 weeks of work, and you did so within 48 hours of beginning?
That's impressive.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:45:23
Yes, a cold wallet address and key could never be "hacked" , only guessed in a completely random attack.
Or, y'know, a nice crowbar to the back of the leg of the owner. So keep your lips tight lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:17:11
And at that comment everyone should be saying "bitcoin **is** the tangible currency" at which point we say back.. then why are you talking about its value in USD and cashing out in USD?
If you're in it to make a profit, make a profit when you want to. It could be huge in ten years, it could be nothing. If it has a huge effect on your life now, cash some out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:19
Exchanges store some money online and readily accessible, and most of it offline. So a typical withdrawal process might look like a huge amount of coin from a few wallets to many, many outputs (the people withdrawing .1-.5 coins)
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:17:47
hey its me ur password

Is it really any easier than just cutting out squares on construction paper with box cutters? Seems like no.

Youtube ad revenue for creators is terribly low.
I'd love to pay them small amounts of real money based off the time I spend watching them. They would get paid more, and I wouldn't have to deal with fucking ads.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:55:34
6% is considered low from the reading that I've done.
I really need to get a TFSA opened alongside my RRSP.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:04:31
The same way you do on desktop.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:15:19
meme is are life!
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:55:04
Not, like, the people developing the technology..?
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:12:12
Well.. men rarely get compliments, so it is a valid point in context.
