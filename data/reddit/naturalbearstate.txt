Featured article is from CNBC. I have attempted to design the site to only retrieve "credible" (CNBC, WSJ, Yahoo, Fox, etc.) news sources. As for the price, that was one person's analysis. Others may analyze and reach a different conclusion. Let me know if you have any additional feedback on the site. I hope to make it more useful.

Erikt311: Fair point - thanks for the link. It's right on the money. 
The "like" property exchange is an uncertain tax position that would have to be defended if questioned. The new legislation specifically clarified going forward that this position cannot be taken as it related to Cryptos.

Haha. Yes, I agree that comment isn't that insightful; however, I'd wager the former Chief Strategist at J.P. Morgan isn't a total idiot, right?

If you needed a justification to HODL. "Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, a hedge fund focused on digital currencies, has told CNBC that Bitcoin may drop 50% before pushing to new highs. Morehead purchased Bitcoin at $72."

Articles are primarily compiled through RSS feeds; as this was the quickest way to see if people found it useful. I am currently working on a few scripts to pull from different sources - that way I can have more control over the end product. Definitely interested, if 1.) you have the time and 2.) if you think this has some utility. PM me and let me know what all you need for App development.

Interesting article  suggesting Bitcoin's true valuation per coin is closer to $4 million. 
While I am extremely skeptical that it will pass $1M, the article articulates a lot of the reasons we could get to a multimillion dollar valuation per coin.

Wow. Props to the OP for 1.) trying it by hand 2) for the thoughtful explanation.

It has been hard to find credible articles about Bitcoin with all the HODL memes/posts. Thanks to inspiration from this community I created  to compile credible news sources. Feel free for any additional constructive feedback. I have tried to keep it simple for easy use.

If your HOLDing you won't have this problem yet... 
Reminder, that your crypto gains are taxable. Hate to see someone get into trouble as the IRS has eliminated trading Bitcoin for altcoins as a "like" property exchange.

Longtime lurker here, I created a site to compile the latest cryptocurrency news. I've been somewhat tired of scavenging the forum with all the memes. I have tried to design the site to only pull 1st rate news sources (WSJ, CNBC, Fox, CNN, Yahoo, etc.). If anyone has suggestions on what additional information to include, I welcome the feedback. Trying for a drudge style simplicity.
