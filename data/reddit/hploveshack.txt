That's the lowest stress way to do it, but the way it matters if you "buy the dip" is if you're selling at peaks.   Then you can afford to buy more at the next dip.
Obviously it's much higher stress, but if you pick the peaks and troughs correctly more often than not you do get something for it.   Personally not worth it for me.

What did you expect to find btc Nostradamus in this place full of hypebeasts and cultists?  It's a loose prediction.  All I said was it's going to correct down.  No time, no amounts, I just said it was going to go down.
Bitcoin doesn't behave like a currency it behaves like a speculative commodity or a stock.  It's unstable and its past pattern always corrected it down out of a bubble.  Considering it's at record highs and super unstable, fluctuating by huge amounts day to day, even hour to hour, this is very obviously a bubble built on hype and fueled by market manipulating pump and dumpers.
Nothing significant has changed in the fundamental structure of btc and very little has changed in the context within which it operates.  There's no reason to believe it would behave significantly differently from the past.
All I said is it's quacking like a duck, therefore it's foolish to believe it's anything but a duck without extremely strong evidence to the contrary.  Evidence no one has, especially not in this place.

You know how easy it is to store a large value of gold?  One pound of gold is like 20,000 dollars.   
It's not that different from storing cryptokeys if you store it secretly and securely, in both cases you'll have to give away the key to your store of value for a bad actor to take it from you.   Even if you memorize the key itself (you'd have to be really trusting in your own memory, and really cautious of any kind of head trauma) and never wrote it down, that's still true.
Main difference, as a store of value, is the value of precious metals is much harder to undercut and has a multi-milennia track record, thus it's much more stable. 
The main problem with gold and other pms is they're taxed as "collectibles" at double the tax rate of capital gains (stocks and cryptos).   So if you "profit" because the petrodollar takes a dive and the value of your gold shoots to 50,000 per oz, even though it buys the same amount of beans and rice and other commodities, you're going to owe a massive amount of tax if you sell any of it for FIAT.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:28
If that's the case, then why is BCH alive right now as the current "loser"?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:31
You do know they made holding gold (and other pms) illegal not even that long ago right?
The government outright stole money from its citizens in broad daylight.  10 years in prison if you didn't turn in your precious metals for a standarized price.  The government then immediately turned around and sold those precious metals for nearly double the price they paid their own citizens to fill its piggybank.
You're really not safe in anything, unless you're an entity capable of jockeying for position with superpower governments.
That said, the logistics of actually enforcing a gold ban would be infinitely more problematic and costly than banning cryptos.

No, this is like the third time this has happened.
It's a cycle of progressive acceptance.   Looking at the numbers of unique btc addresses and the exponential rate at which they've increased, I'd guess we're about one third to one half of the way to "mainstream" in terms of time.  At least three or four more hype booms and panic busts.
Problem is btc isn't really a very good currency.  The transaction fees and confirmation times get in the way and require middlemen to "guarantee" transactions in escrow, acting very similarly to credit card companies.   BTC will probably remain a speculative commodity for quite some time, but some other, better designed crypto will take over the actual currency function.

I'll start worrying about that when we've leaped over some of the several thousand hurdles between present day commercial spacefaring and commercial asteroid mining.
Not to mention that wouldn't even work, the capital costs to mine an asteroid would be enormous.  Unless the gold is found in a very high purity (incredibly unlikely), it probably wouldn't even be worth mining and refining it for decades after its discovery.  You would still need lots of time for the technology to develop, economies of scale to emerge, and the costs of asteroid mining to come way down, probably by a couple orders of magnitude.
This actually illustrates exactly why gold is a way more reliable store of value, because mechanical processes inherently operate in a slower timescale than electronic ones.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:49:11
Nearly all currencies from the time they figured out how to mine and smelt metal up till about 50 years ago were based on precious metals.
When it comes to stability, track record is everything and bitcoin's track record of a few years is garbage compared to precious metals' track record of multiple milennia.

There's no reason to unless you're buying in quantities worth 7+ figures in USD or you're a speculator who needs to move it around a lot.
Regular people looking for a stable store of value don't buy paper precious metals.  It defeats the whole point if the actual property isn't under your physical control and you're instead relying on the law to ensure your property remains yours.
There's no reason to not take physical delivery for pms for the average person, 99.99% of the people on never invested more than 4 figures in bitcoin.  If they invested the same in gold they could hold it in one hand with ease.  Most people simply don't have the kind of spending money where paper pms make sense, they especially don't have it for crypto gambling.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:20:35
Probably would, but I only gamble with money I don't care if I lose and not a lot of that in my budget at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:17:16
Correct.  It's not really enforcable at scale due to the impossible amounts of manpower needed.  It's similar to how they enforce copyright laws in the face of online piracy.  They occasionally burn a witch at the stake and rely on people to self-enforce out of fear of punishment.   
It accomplishes maybe 60% of the effect of real enforcement, while costing less by a factor of about a million.  It's basically crowdsourced policing.
Whether or not 6102 applied to small holders is debatable since the threshold was set at $100 in gold coins which translates to about $6k today.  That's not pocket change, but that's really not that much money.  A few month's worth if you lost your income.  If people were limited to holding no more than $6k in cryptos...

It's not about backing currency with gold, it's about backing it with work.
Gold requires considerable work to mine and refine, that is where much of its value derives and that work naturally limits the supply.  Similarly, cryptos require considerable work to mine, which is how they achieve their value.
Obviously there is an element of collective agreement, but that's precisely the same way all markets work to value all things.  It's particularly noticeable in the odder markets like "collectibles" and "antiques" where the value is often wildly different from the actual amount of work that went into the object.   Yet the initial value of the object was derived from work.

Haha, you're pretty harsh on them and even that's not harsh enough.
This is literal robbery of citizens.  It was a traitorous act to pay for a war.
And lets not forget removing the ability for citizens to call in their notes for gold allowed the fed to steal more and more from every person that held USD over the proceeding decades by printing money.   When nixon took us fully off of the gold standard (which US citizens already had been for 40 years) at least he stopped foreign governments from calling in their notes while citizens still couldn't.

As is the way of government, it took money from the people, wasted a bunch of it, then "created jobs" that don't actually produce any wealth or value with the rest.
The government doesn't give you anything, it only takes and if you're lucky, hands you back a portion of what it took.   I see this mentality every year when tax returns come back.  People act like its christmas and uncle sam is santa claus because they got some of their own money back.

If you possess a car the chance of you accidentally or intentionally killing someone rises considerably.   A clear and present statistical threat.  Therefore we have the RIGHT to take your car?
If you buy land next to mine, build a house, and start living there the chance of you harming me rises considerably.  Therefore I have a RIGHT to drive you from your land?
If you're alive the chance that you could harm someone is infinitely higher than if you were dead.  Therefore everyone else has the RIGHT to take your life?

I don't understand why people keep trying to draw a line in the sand between currency and speculation, do you just love conflict?
Speculators are only helping to increase the adoption rate of bitcoin.  This is a necessary phase of bitcoin adoption as a currency, once the volatility stabilizes in the years to come, because most everyone knows about it and has made their decision on buying in or staying out, it will be in a perfect position to act as a currency.

Chargebacks also affect your credit score negatively.  It's really only worth doing if there's some kind of fraud involving at least a few hundreds dollars.
Plus you have to assume the additional costs of credit card companies are passed on to the consumer anyway.  
Still, it's a nice safety net for the consumer against fraud.  
I don't see bitcoin replacing credit cards anyway, it will just be another option along side of it, to be used with trustworthy merchants to avoid credit card companies and banks and governments interfering with the transaction.
And they could probably have a slightly lower price if you pay in bitcoin as a result.

1.  ATMs have fees for withdrawal.
2.  ATMs cost money to produce and maintain, even if you didn't pay fees that cost would influence you as a customer of the bank in a negative way through some other avenue of interaction with the bank.  Cost is passed on to customers.
3.  Credit cards have a cost to merchants, a cost that is passed on to the customer as well, usually regardless of if you're using a credit card.  Notice how some gas stations have different prices for cash/debit versus credit.
Ultimately, using any of those methods is convenient now, but you're paying the price in lots of hidden costs to the banks, namely the fact that your money doesn't appreciate for shit, the bank takes the lion's share of any appreciation your money would accrue and gives you a pittance.  
You're also paying the price to the credit card companies through increased prices at the merchants to support the convenience of a credit card.  
And you're paying the price to governments any time your goods cross a border or change currencies with often grossly out of whack exchange rates (and hidden fees for changing currencies) and additional tariffs.  And that's all on top of the usual taxes.
