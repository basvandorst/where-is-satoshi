Would gov agents be wrong to trust in this industry? Are they the ones hacking? Confused by your statement. Sorry if I'm a noob at this.

Ask Peter Schiff if he thinks the world is going to be using paper money in 100 years.
GG. Well done fam. Pack it up.

Oh ok, well I sent it to my ledger from Coinbase, I did one for LTC (not segwit) and it was almost instant. Is bitcoin usually this long? I thought Segwit was even faster and cheaper lol.

They inquired 100 million customers within decades of being a business. They didn't get 15 million in one week. Coinbase has been slammed and these children are just bitching.

Decided to buy a lambo instead of feeding my 4 kids. Can't pay insurance on it.

Glad to have ya apart of the team 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:09:42
yeah I know, I sent to a legacy for LTC, didnt do the segwit just yet. I'm just curious on my BTC from Coinbase to a segwit address. LTC was almost instant.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:11:04
Oh I thought I was in the whole 7 second time frame .. been like 30 mins.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:43:02
What do I do now?? Lol new to this. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:26:14
Imagine your local bank having 15 million new members banging at the door and trying to get in and get set up. Lol give them some credit
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:04:51
Definitely going to HODL. just trying to see if I can SEE the funds in my Nano S
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:29
Imagine 15 million people banging on the doors of a local bank. What do you expect is going to happen? Give them some credit and relax dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:01:26
How do you predict this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:20
Thanks guys for reassuring me. Terrified when your money gets taken into the abyss even though it's not much lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:48:28
If my ledger nano isn't getting the segwit transfer from Coinbase that was a test, how do I get that money back and how do i send it as a legacy?
again, sorry if i'm a noob. It just says pending in Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:09:23
Thanks for the reassurance man. Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:43:08
15 million new people?! Oh come on man. Give me them some slack
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:17:14
You must be fun at parties. Love the logic. Please take a joke more seriously.

What is everyone thoughts when BTC Future Trading hit Wall Street on December 10th?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:07:18
Lol! One of the comments asked "Who wins the presidency in 2016?" Ron Paul was the largest result.
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:40:33
I hope so. Waiting for the tax refund to come in 
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:11:59
Is this shit people have said about Bitcoin on Twitter?
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:24:18
If you look at the global exchanges, there is a huge buy wall at $4000.  
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:11:23
There's a few people who do have creditbility in TA. If you follow some of the best forex traders that make $25k a day, then I think youd see his side a little bit more. Not only do these "gurus" call BTC on the damn fucking spot, but it's close enough to give them some type of credit. I understand the majority of TA fucks have no clue, but there are some real ones.

Dude the entire internet is based off people who have zero ground to back up what their saying. Unless you link me your degrees, you're just another cynical troll sputing out non sense about your experience. How do any of us know? That is literally the theme of the internet, get over it. No one knows what anyone else is qualified for but everyone has a damn opinion.
Now obviously I don't think you're a liar and I am in economics as well, but I think a qualified opinion and an opinion are two distinctions we should sort out. 
Everyone can have an opinion and have the right to post it on Reddit or wherever. Does it make it qualified? No. Will you ever know if they're qualified? Maybe in a few hours of conversation.
TLDR: get over the fact that you'll never know what a qualified opinion is. Move on. And prepare your arguments well and you should excel.

In John McAfee's interview on the Bad Crypto Podcast he talks as if he knows who Satoshi was like no big deal. Although I'm not too big on trying to find out who it is/was, it just seems a bit coincidental for all of this to be a one-man planned. 2conspiracy4me
