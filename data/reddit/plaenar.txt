At the end of the e.g. 90 days, does the btc need to be transferred / settled?

Makes sense. Investors can trade futures instead of bothering to store or paying someone to store their coins. Whoever is left to buy actual coins should be looking for utility rather than purely as an investment.

It's useful if the institutional investor wants to own the actual asset.  If they used cash settled contracts, they would still need to use that cash to buy the assets afterwards.

MER is 1.5% according to [their site](

I guess.  But I'm talking about the case where they want more than just price exposure.  Consider other crypto assets that an investor might actually want to hold or use, things like securities tokens or staking tokens.  Even for bitcoin, if there is a reason to own it (for its utility), then there is a reason to buy it through physically delivered futures.

Technically this fits the definition of an ETN because the fund issuer itself does not hold bitcoin. The guarantor is the entity that covers the debt if the issuer were to default. In this case the guarantor holds the corresponding number of bitcoins so it can always pay out, and it also happens that the guarantor and issuer belong to the same parent company.  
tl;dr this is basically an ETF disguised as an ETN.

Wouldn't insolvent exchanges not support BCC because they lack the corresponding amount of BTC?

It's a knockoff of a copper coin.  Look at the letters, the A and R are identical.

Why not just take a loan on $1000 and pay it back+interest after 6 months?

The futures are physically settled 1 day futures.  They are not for predictions.

It originates from [this physical coin design](

It was the first fork of its code.  Not a fork of its blockchain.

If they just approve some ETFs, you can be sure the volume will flow into the US.

Coinbase is acquiring companies left and right.  Cipher browser a few days ago, now 21 inc.
Edit: Here are [Brian's tweets]( about this:

21 inc was massively (over)hyped from years past.  Coinbase must be seeing something that we don't.

I must be missing something.  How do you load testnet coins into the app?  There is no button to show your wallet address.

Wow thanks, never would have thought of that!
