what about when we feel our taxes are being put towards uncivic ends?

We need a navy, with  about half the current naval power we project, no army, and an airforce that is about half as strong as the current airforce. In addition, we need a large drone contingent that is manufactured from fully automated government owned factories. This business of paying other people to build drones for a premium price has got to stop. Also, lots of nukes for deterrences sake. 
No more gitmo. Close it down entirely. 
No more prison for nonviolent drug offenders. All current for profit prisons have their charters of incorporation dissolved, and the prisons are turned into places where druggies can use safely out of the public view, and are forced to stay inside until no longer high. They buy their drugs from government, which are mass produced for profit at low cost.
No more drug war. All drugs are legal, except you must go to aforementioned converted prisons if you're doing hard drugs that risk lives.
No more asset forfeiture. 
No more allowing corporations to donate money to election campaigns.
Taxes are now progressive, and there are no loopholes, special clauses or even long term vs short term capital gains. Also, no need for alternative minimum tax because everyone pays, and there is no loophole to not paying. 
All money that was being wasted on murdering and imprisoning people now goes towards lifting people out of poverty through gifts. For example, college is now free. Medicaid for all. 
Lobbying by corporations is now illegal and corporations found attempting to sway government policy will have their charter of incorporation revoked, and their entire board sent to jail with mandatory minimums of 4 years.

I mined with my 22 terrahashes straight through the storm. GIMME YO HIGH FEES AND I SHALL MAKE THEM INTO VERTCOINS!

Well how about a 1 minute block time? The lowest possible block time is what should be aimed for.

Ether is not the banker coin. That is ripple. Ether is the technologist's token. Ether is the token that does functional real world computation and logic. ether unlocks doors, runs smart economies, and is the backbone for moving value amongst machines.

How does the lightning network guarantee instaneous transactions when the block time is 10 minutes?

I bought bitcoin myself at 3,000. (the first 3,000) I know my lessons. Here is what I am doing.
On november 14th. I am selling. I am out. I know there is a crash, and I am going to be buying altcoins and ethereum. They will have more of a store of value than btc will during nov16.
On nov 17, I am going to kraken, and executing margin shorts on bitcoin. They will be watched manually, and I am going for a conservative drop of $500 in the first day. 
On nov 19 I am going to stop shorting bitcoin. I will be using all my short gains to buy litecoin and vertcoin. At this point one of two things will have happened:
Bitcoin will be alive but bruised.
Bitcoin will be dead and converted to bitcoin2x.
In either case, stable cryptos that are a key part of the scaling protocol (lightning network + atomic swaps) are going to take off. Both segwit and segwit2x can facilitate them, and that means that litecoin is going through the roof, as is vertcoin and decred. All 3 have atomic swaps working, and its only a matter of time for them to gain valuation.

are you saying we should all move to iota? Lol! stahp it!
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:51:29
For moving value between exchanges, I always transfer to litecoin before moving. It's faster, and cheaper.

If btc had a smart contract rule that if a wallet is not touched for fifty years, it goes to become a mining reward lost btc would be a non issue.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:42:15
Its bitcoin core because bitcoin gold, bitcoin cash bitcoin diamond and bitcoin star trek have diluted the name of bitcoin to oblivion. CURSE YOU BCH!

Bitcoin can give a more decentralized society. In fact, the blockchain could allow entire national decisions, like making war on iraq or not. Or how about tying every facebook post to a pseudoanonymous realid that can be used to prove that the poster is an american citizen? Then we can get rid of the stupid russia debate. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 01:04:49
But how does this relate to price or tech? Sure satoshi nakamoto may have made btc, but the community is what fixed it. If satoshi nakamoto is behind iota, who cares? Iota is probably as buggy as btc was when it was first released! Btc4ever!
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:13:30
Aight, its all good. I have been called names before for wanting a more free society, but scammer was a new one xD

bitcoin is better than both nano and litecoin. Nano is a dag, but its centralized, with no way to break the centralization. In one way or another all dags are centralized. Nano has their spend verifications with devs holding 60% of the vote. Iota has their coordinator that keeps their network from being 51% attacked by spam transactions verifying false transactions. Hashgraph is completely closed source and is plastered in all kinds of do not use or else legal stickers. In the end, all dags are all centralized. If any dag has a chance of breaking the mold its iota, but that is another discussion. Btc is better than nano, no matter what charlie lee thinks.

Nope, I am not a scammer, I don't want your money. I want your mindshare, your backing and your input on how to make the dream a reality.

I refer to bitcoin as bitcoin core, because there are a bajillion stupid forks including cash, private, gold, diamond, etc. 
All of those other forks include the name bitcoin. They should have done what litecoin and vertcoin did which have carved out their own niches and are respectable cryptos.

Buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is king.   
Altcoins worth giving a damn about:  
Eth.  
BNB.

My sell target is at 200k
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:07:36
Are you joking? my sell targets are between 175k-200k
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:40:58
I think the next all time high will be 10x the last all time high. so 200k
