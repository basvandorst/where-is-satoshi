The interest applies only to what you don't pay off at the end of the month. In the interest (no pun intended) of profit, the credit card company is hoping you overspent and can't pay it off completely.
I think what ven28 is getting here is that credit cards can be useful to the consumer: you can get rewards for using them, and your credit rating improves because creditors know they can depend on you. Maybe when you plan to settle down one day, you can get a great interest rate on your first home. However, these benefits go right out the window as soon as you miss a payment and your APR goes up to 29%. 
And that's what the credit card company is banking on (ok, this time pun intended): that enough people will overspend due to wants and needs that the company can pay its employees and rent and utilities, etc, and still make a profit for the shareholders.

The problem here in America began when the profits started getting larger and competition increased. There were a couple different major competing credit cards in the Sixties: BankAmericard, which became Visa when it joined with other credit card companies in other countries, and Master Charge, which later became MasterCard.
Originally, you only wanted people who you absolutely KNEW were going to pay you back to be enrolled in your credit card program. But there's only so many of those people in a country, and between a couple different companies grabbing people up (with some pretty sneaky tactics, check out the "Boston Fee Party" for a fun fiscal yarn), there's not enough customers to go around to increase your profit. 
But someone did the math on it and realized, "Hey, we can just give everyone a credit card! Sure, some of them will throw them away, and some will charge some stuff and eventually declare bankruptcy, but most will be like, 'hey, free money!'"
These credit card companies mailed out so many unsolicited credit cards that there was nearly one credit card for every two people in the US in 1970. And I mean, everyone was getting these things: people who couldn't hold down a job, compulsive gamblers, people who couldn't save money if their lives depended on it. It got so bad they had to pass a law that said you could only mass mail APPLICATIONS rather than actual CARDS.
This attitude has kind of carried over to today. I don't want to sound like the guy in *Fight Club*, but advertising really does have us chasing things we don't really need. And if you take an 18 year old kid, who's lived with his parents his entire life, who's never had a job, paid rent, bought groceries, etc, and get him signed up for this *magic card full of money that he didn't earn*, well, nine times out of ten, he's going to go to the mall and buy all that cool stuff he could never save up for before, like nice sneakers, and Oakley sunglasses, and the brand new iPhone, and an Xbox One AND PS4, because why choose, right?
College campuses are rife for this kind of "prey on the ignorant" approach. A group will set up a little booth in a public area with a sign like "Free Burger King combo meal! ^^when ^^you ^^sign ^^up ^^for ^^our ^^credit ^^card 
I have a credit card that I use to pay some of my bills, but sometimes when I see something in a store that I've been saving up  for a while in order to buy, there's always that little voice that says, "Hey, why wait? You're gonna buy it eventually anyways! You could be using it *right now*, just use the credit card! Let *future you* deal with it! Besides, he'll be so happy enjoying the new Dead Rising/bicycle/LCD TV that he won't even be mad!"
And that's where the profit is made: people buying stuff they can't afford and don't need.
In researching this a little more in depth, I got to reading about the European system, and it does sound very nice. I think a lot of it just has to do with culture influencing laws and business, which then influence culture.

Not meaning this as an insult, but I think the original poster, dretone, is fairly young. Back in the day, there were similar arguments against credit cards.
* So a person just puts a piece of paper of this piece of plastic with numbers on it, and rolls a bar over it, and you can trade the imprinted paper for cash from the company whose logo is on the card?
* What if this person just makes a fake card? Whose going to reimburse me for those goods he basically stole?
* Why should I put $80 on my credit card, so I can pay more later due to interest? Why not just pay cash?
* Keep in mind, the turn-around wasn't good back then, either. 14 minutes? Try **several days** at the speed of the US postal service for you, the merchant, to compile all your credit card slips, mail them off, and wait for the funds.
And yet, today, credit cards are everywhere! It seems odd, at least to me, when I walk into a retail store that doesn't take a credit card. Credit cards are one more way for people to pay for their goods or services, thus bringing in more business. 
Bitcoin is the same way: accepting it opens you up to new business. I don't think I'm alone here in saying that I've bought things, in person and online, that I otherwise wouldn't have bought for the sole reason that they accepted bitcoin.
LogoPro, thanks for taking the time to go through OP's points, one by one, and discussing them rationally with counter-arguments, instead of getting an attitude about it.

I don't know much (by which I mean anything at all) about German law, but in America there are several reasons one might want to use a credit card rather than a debit card (what people in my region call a card that ties to your bank account and has a PIN):
1. With a credit card, you can spend money you don't have yet. If you're waiting on next month's paycheck and you need (or most likely, just really REALLY want) something right now (perhaps auto repair, food, etc,) a credit card will let you attain those things even if you have no cash on hand.
2. The more you use a credit card, and pay off the balance, the more your credit rating improves. When you go to the bank to attempt to get a loan for something (such as a house, a car, or maybe money to start a business,) the loan officer will look at your credit rating to see if you will pay your bills on time, and if you pay the full balance back. If you have a great credit rating, then you're more likely to get a great interest rate; after all, the bank wants to give you an incentive to get the loan from them rather than another bank, since they know they will make some money off your loan when you pay it back. That's how "savings and loan" type banks afford to pay interest to you in your savings account.
3. Both debit and credit cards have a $50 "consumer liability limit" when it comes to a stolen card being used for fraudulent purposes. However, the credit card company must be notified within 60 days. With a debit card, you only get 2 days to notice the charge and report it.
4. Credit cards typically have a much lower "overdraft fee," in order to encourage spending.
5.   Many credit card companies offer "rewards" programs. My dad, who flies often as part of his job, chooses a credit card that gives him lots of free airline miles on the carriers he uses most often, thereby saving him a lot of money. By purchasing something with a credit card rather than a debit card, he ends up getting more for his money. Maybe think of it like one of those little rewards cards you get at Subway: buy ten sandwiches, get the 11th free! Sure, you could just always pay cash for lunch everyday and never get the little stamp on your card if you wanted, but if you were going to buy a sandwich everyday, why not keep the reward card in your wallet, get it stamped, and get the 11th sandwich for nothing? In the end, each sandwich is actually cheaper.
Sorry for going on so long about sandwiches, I missed lunch because of work and I still have to go get something to eat (it's about two hours past my usual dinnertime.)

I totally agree that banks taking care of this would be a much better system. I hate the fact that I have to spend money to be seen by our  credit system as "trustworthy" to get more money to spend. I have a, not large, but significant amount of money for someone my age in various types of savings, including a savings account, cash deposits, an investment account, and a Roth IRA (and bitcoin, of course, but I'm not expecting them to be on THAT particular boat yet.) Why can't the loan officer look at that and see that I'm a pretty responsible person with money?
In regards to your alternate universe, the best I've found is a [Smarty Pig]( bank account. It's entirely online, I can do it on my phone, and I can make individual, named savings accounts for everything. I have savings accounts for a trip to Europe, a house, etc. I used to have one where I would save up for Bitcoin, but my savings goal of $150 for that account should tell you how long ago I've used that particular account. They also have a debit card feature that you have to load funds onto from one of your goals. I like it because it helps control my spending, although I would like to be able to have more security features.
My ideal security feature? I scan the card at the register, and the computer connects to the bank, and splashes a big picture of me on the clerk's screen with the words **VERIFY CUSTOMER IDENTITY** in red across the screen. No expensive extra equipment, just taking advantage of what's already there.

AOL was a killer back then. You have to dedicate time that no one in the house will be on the phone, then you dial up, hopefully connect. Afterwards, type in the address of the exact page you want to go to, then go get a drink, maybe make something to eat, tell mom about how your day at school was, and MAYBE after all that, your 14400 modem has downloaded half a picture of a boob. And then you'd hear someone coming down the hall and you close the window really quick, but it's your dad, who was just coming back to do the same thing. Now you're both disappointed.
And buying stuff on the internet? Ridiculous! My dad looked at this form to submit your credit card to buy something, and just said "All I have to do is type in my information, and I don't have to prove anything? What's to keep THIS GUY from taking the information I give him, and giving it to OTHER GUYS to buy stuff for himself? And I'm just supposed to trust him to mail me the stuff AFTER I give him the money? It's not like he's Sears."

Yup, that's the key: the interest only affects what you DON'T pay off with your bill. If you're a responsible adult, it doesn't cost you any more than it would have, plus you get some perks in the rewards program, as well as an improved credit rating.
