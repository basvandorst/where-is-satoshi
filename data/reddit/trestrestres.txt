I live in Italy and I bought it with no problems.
I had only to change the cable because here we have 220 V and they sent me one for 125 V

Merry Christmas BetKingIO

I agree with you. Was not my intention to propose a new coin.
Surely I do not have the skills required to do so.

I read : CG, Roth IRA, ETF.
Nice to read but impossible to understand.
It would be nice if americans would start to imagine that the world is bigger than America ;-)

In my opinion the best faucet is : 
The reason? you earn coins only (yes, ONLY) receiving a mail everyday and doing nothing more. ;-)

value up.... then quantity released to miners decrease, value down... then quantity released increase
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:13:56
You can do also 3x , also short , at BTC-e in a MT4 platform
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:52:41
why is it not possible to see it in Italy?
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:46:26
July 7th or Aug 7th?

you would invest 1 billion $ to destroy bitcoin when we could start to use the day after  a different digital coin? :-)

As I know to open a non resident account you should do it in person.
The main italian banks are Unicredito and Banca Intesa.
Welcome in Italy!
@_date: 2014-04-26 10:43:52
why having a bank the volatility should be reduced?
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:17:21
I am not rich... but why not? :-)
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:26:52

Trying to send money having a not resident account in Austria (Unicredit Group) to Bitstamp to buy BTC, my bank said that (like not resident)  it is not permitted.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:17:24
$ 540
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:20:36
my statistic after exactly 1 month:received money back 422 times. delays (I consider them at 85% loss) 45.
Net annualized return 65.55%.
I had not big experience and so I am confident to do better in future
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:21:20
I am using this: 
In my opinion is the best because you dont need to do anything and you  receive cryptos everyday for free
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:02:34
Me too I think so... and in this case I want to warn everybody regarding this site
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:46:23
Me too I am satisfied of Bitstamp service
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:26:56
How to buy them?
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:37:20
I am retired
@_date: 2014-05-05 09:10:57
Me too I am from Europe.
My experience: I bought from Bitstamp and from BTC-e.
Like you can see BTC-e has lower prices.
Bitstamp has a good service and  withdrawals are easy and speedy. 
With BTC-e you have to wait one month.
So I suggest you (according to my personal experience) Bitstamp 
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:26:16
yes... I made a mistake... I agree with you
@_date: 2014-04-16 07:36:47

@_date: 2014-05-23 06:27:15
