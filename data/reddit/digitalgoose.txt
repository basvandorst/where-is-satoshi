If a large enough cartel of miners forms, it seems they can do this without much risk. Even though non-cartel miners sometimes find blocks, the overall higher fees would make up for it. Only solution I can see is decentralize mining more...

Sounds like a website could have stolen, from the watch only wallet, your XPUB which is a list of all your addresses. If so then you have less anonymity now.
Also, somewhat related - in general, never give out a single private key to any of your electrum addresses, because if someone knows your XPUB and just 1 (any) private key, they can combine them to figure out ALL your private keys.  You should not be giving out private keys anyway so this shouldn't be an isssue...

There are only a handful of people on the planet that are smart enough to work on Bitcoin. This isn't a project like Firefox - in addition to being a skilled coder, you need advanced knowledge of cryptography and security that few programmers have. Very advanced math. Not only that, but they need to be sold on the idea of cryptocurrency and willing to switch careers to work on it. This is a very small group of people.
So if someone wanted to undermine Bitcoin, the best thing they could do is troll the hell out of the developers, constantly attack them whenever they try to participate in forums, raise doubts as to their motives, make them feel terrible. Do this enough until they are forced to stop interacting with the community, get fed up, and quit.
Added bonus: those qualified to work on Bitcoin who weren't already doing so, see this toxic behavior and stay clear of Bitcoin, too.
Shortage of competent developers - much more effective (and secret) than a 51% attack.
I'm not saying someone is trying to undermine Bitcoin this way, but if you look at what has happened to some of the brightest Bitcoin programmers lately - those who were lucky enough to be funded, so they could take their volunteer work and make it full time by starting Blockstream - you could wonder if someone is trying to make them quit Bitcoin.
How amazing are these "evil 'Core' developers"?
*[“If this amazing team offers you a job, you should take it,”]( tweeted Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist, Bitcoin Foundation.
As for their bitcoin holdings - [“Everyone at Blockstream has a monetary interest in Bitcoin's success-- we use timelocked bitcoins as incentive compensation”](
So while I'm not sure if that is what is going on, it's not unprecedented. See the wikipedia page on [State-sponsored Internet sockpuppetry groups]( or this article  [My life as a pro-Putin propagandist in Russia’s secret 'troll factory']( - this tactic has already been used online before.

The rule "Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere" is there because it would very quickly turn into a flame war of bitcoin supporters vs monero supporters vs ripple supporters. I think the general bitcoin supporter argument would be, Ripple is centralized and Monero can't scale.

There is an altcoin called Myriad that has 5 POW's,
"POW: Scrypt, SHA256D, Qubit, Skein or Myriad-Groestl. How it works - Each proof of work algorithm has its own independent difficulty. Any algorithm can find the next block. All the algorithms use the same difficulty adjustment method. On average, each algorithm has the same chance of finding the next block. Each algorithm aims for a block generation time of 2.5 minutes. Over the five algorithms, a block should be found on average every 30 seconds."
I'm wondering why something like that wouldn't be a better idea for Bitcoin. Add Keccak, current ASIC miners have their overall returns reduced by 50% but they aren't kicked off the network completely. The GPU friendly POW for the other 50%, brings new users and the excitement of mining at home back (for a while).

I thought Quark was 1 POW that was made of nested hashes (each a different algo), ie hash(hash(hash)), where as Myriad has them all going at the same time independently. A much more interesting design.
[I saw talk of it on bitcoin-wizards once](
    tromp_: zooko, have you considered using multiple pows, like myriad?
    zooko: tromp: we have. Myriad-like things went into the bucket of potentially good ideas that we don't have enough teeth to chew.
    ....
    zooko: there's a proposal for multi-PoW, named Myriad, which makes it so it only goes south if they *all* fail. It's a really neat idea.
This is zooko of [zooko's triangle]( fame (I think) saying it is a neat idea. So I think this idea has some actual merit and isn't typical scamcoin stuff. Myriadcoin itself may have been a pump/dump, but its POW idea seems like an honest attempt to try something different.
, I'd be curious to know what you think of this approach. My guess is, it adds too much complexity.

but again the solution you are withholding is to a block that would give the pool rewards, not you, so this attack is just to screw over the pool

Isn't the nonce (in modern Bitcoin Core or Electrum wallets) deterministic - basically the hash of the message, so any nonce that isn't the hash of the Tx would be strongly suspect?
(But I do not know how to verify this, from say a Tx that an Offline Electrum signed)

In an offline wallet setup, such as Electrum, where there is 1 pc online and 1 offline(with the private key), which Electrum picks the nonce?  I think it is the signer (offline) that chooses the nonce, correct?
So you'd really want to be sure the Offline Electrum was verified/not malware'd , but you don't need to worry so much about the online one?
Or Is there a scenario where a compromised online Electrum can generate a valid looking malicious tx to sign, which causes the non-compromised offline Electrum to leak private key information?

The fee is based on how many bytes the transaction is, so 1000 inputs will cost about the same if they are 1 cent inputs, or 1 dollar. You might get a miner to pick it up for 0 fee... but I'd expect most would pass on including it in a block.
The ["Lightning Network"]( which is being worked on will allow for true micro-payments.

Maybe? Based on the 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas I'm not sure if the electric bill to mine 200 blocks was ever less than 2 pizzas...  I thought I'd read that even in 2009 people were only getting 1-2 blocks per day... so 100-200 days of mining 24/7 vs 2 pizzas? It seems really close. (Of course you couldn't buy bitcoin in early 2009 if you wanted to!)

If it crashed... Not 75%. More like 87%
Last time it dropped from $1163 (2013-11-29) to $152 (2015-01-13).
That would be like dropping from today's ATH of $6910 down to **$905**.

$905 is where we were about 1 year ago so that doesn't sound impossible to me.

they call it " accession to wealth", treated this way:


"Even an unanticipated windfall is considered income. For instance, if a taxpayer finds money hidden inside a piano, that money becomes income to them: see Cesarini v. U.S., 428 F.2d 812 (6th Cir. 1970)."
Forks are complicated because:
"Dominion - If a taxpayer sees a $20 bill, but does not pick it up, they have not yet realized any income, because the money is not yet theirs. "
yet by having the private key to the forked coins one could argue you "picked it up"/it is your new property (accession to wealth) even if you didn't want it

I think the only chance to be a bitcoin billionaire was to mine from day 1 and never stop mining... see this guy's post


So a billionare in bitcoin would need 157,673 today, and this dude who mined from day 1 only had 8550 by the 2nd month... who knows if there was anyone else out there like him, or if he kept mining after getting bored. Would you have found 17 of these guys to sell you 100% of their stash by 2010 for a few hundred dollars each? It seems unlikely... you'd need to get lots of people to sell you lots of pizza's worth of coins.... No evidence that ever happened ...

2) there are investors in other cyrotocurrencies who would love to harm bitcoin for financial reasons,
3) and yes, there is Ver/Wu who may fall in to the  camp, or maybe they genuinely think "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"
Bitcoin has many KNOWN enimies and likely more behind the scenes.
You cannot be owner of Bitcoin.org and use excuses like... "signed up with a dumb and easy to guess password... I was in a rush...".  
And "never got around to changing it", your account was 1 year old before you admitted it was hacked, how much time did you need to secure that password? *How long was it hacked for?*
*Because you choose to be anonymous we can never trust you now.*

You *choose to be anonymous*. We must hold you to a higher standard, because *we cannot verify you in Real Life*.
You can never use a "dumb and easy to guess password". **Ever.** Once your account is compromised, your anonymous identity is worthless. We can never trust you again. Because (1) you can't confirm in Real Life that you recovered your accounts, (2) because you have shown unnecessary carelessness with your identity and likely will do it again.
In this comment, Theymos was asked, "you personally know who it is, right?" and he [answers, "No. He was made co-owner by Sirius, though, so he is very likely to be trustworthy."](
Sirius's twitter is public: 
Perhaps you can ask Sirius to confirm you are not compromised. He needs to say he knows your Real Life identity and that he confirmed, in real life, that you are no longer compromised.

Unless you have a wallet.dat you don't have any bitcoins. I don't know how you could have extracted any private keys out of a wallet back in September 2009. Tools to do so did not exist. I don't know what is in your excel sheet but it doesn't sound like anything bitcoin related (certainly not from 2009).


There was no wallet encryption until 2011
In another comment you mention mining on Slush's pool which did not exist until very late 2010 in the days of GPU mining. Your story does not add up at all... there have been several fake "I'm bitcoin rich!/I found old bitcoins!" posts lately (that get lots of upvotes) and yours sounds like one.

I always thought it was extremely strange that *Ver lived across the street from Mt. Gox* and it sounds like he had high level access to Mt Gox's computers (even purchased them for Mt Gox!). 
"After Mt. Gox was hacked for the first time in summer of 2011, a friend asked Powell [CEO of Kraken, who went to highschool with Ver] to help out, and soon, the San Francisco entrepreneur found himself on a plane to Tokyo. After landing, he rushed to Shibuya station, where he was met by his friend, **Roger Ver, one of the world's biggest bitcoin supporters who just happened to live across the street from Mt. Gox.** Without bothering to drop off Powell's bags, the two rushed to the Mt. Gox offices to see what they could do."
Around the same time Ver and Powell were helping, the coins were stolen [according to this report]( - "In September 2011, the MtGox hot wallet private keys were stolen, in a case of a simple copied wallet.dat file"
Ver should have known how incredibly sloppy the security was having seen it first hand.

I wonder this too, I've asked some people I trust and they seem to think it is safe.
However, consider this message from in 2011 when they were creating the signing feature -
[nullc: "I don't believe your proposal actually provides a secure solution with ECDSA_SIGN(SHA256(fixed_string+message))..."](
They did not take his advice.
So as I understand it:
there is some tiny chance these byteball/stellar messages could derive your key IF sha256 were somewhat broken, which is unlikely
that specific risk could be avoided IF you could add your own text to the message they want you to sign, but that's not how these giveaways work - you can't add your own "nonce" to the message, you can only sign EXACTLY what they give you.
So I guess in theory they could create special byteball/stellar addresses that help them crack your bitcoin privkey.
But one could argue the byteball/stellar addresses you are including in your signed message are (LIKELY) random numbers generated BY YOU (by byteball/stellar software running on your local pc) and so unlikely to be malicious strings they've crafted in advance.
Secondly, there is also the risk that is the same as [address-reuse]( but that is another topic, and bitcoin as a whole would be f'ed if it were an issue today. So that one I'm not too worried about

"The name "Electrum" has been visible on bitcoincash.org and
electrumcash.org, with a modified version of our logo. The use of our
name and logo constitutes a trademark infringement.
We have never enforced our trademark against altcoin versions of
Electrum (such as Litecoin, etc), because we consider that users of
these altcoins are well aware of the distinction between Bitcoin and
their coin, and that they cannot be harmed by that confusion. However,
we do not agree with the use of the Electrum name in the context of a
Bitcoin fork, because it suggests that we endorse that fork, and that
we also endorse that wallet."

If you still have long term gains you can do a similar trick - sell and pay 0% federal tax up to some yearly limit - buy it back right away - you've increased your cost basis for free. (Talk to a CPA, first don't listen to some random internet guy)

yes, from core you can "dumpprivkey" on the address that has the coins, and it will tell you the secret private key.
Then you can install Electrum, when setting it up there is an option to make a new wallet by importing that key... paste it in and you're all set
Of course don't share this key with anyone
except you don't want to SWEEP, you want to IMPORT instead

They make more money.
It's more profitable to pretend you aren't adopting SegWit for vague "technical reasons", and stall by proposing/backing your own ridiculous alternatives (20x blocksize increase, hard forks, changes that give miners complete control over the blocksize, etc) - alternatives that you know nobody will want.
Stall as long as you can while you make tons of money in fees!
There was a time in the computer industry where everyone knew IBM would someday get into the game, but they hadn't yet, and life was good. But then one day IBM got into the game and very few of the little guys survived. All of today's miners are little guys compared to AMD/NVidia/Intel/etc. They want to milk it as long as they can. Bitcoin's price has not slowed down in any way despite the stalling, so why stop stalling?
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:18:18
each coin has different amounts of "total coins in circulation" so mult that # * coin price = mkt cap
