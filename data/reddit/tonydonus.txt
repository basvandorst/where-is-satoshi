and just like so many browser security add ons for fighting malware. after using malwarebytes to cleanse, i do manual malware check/removal. I never use widgets or javascript AT ALLLL when your btc client is online. and i never unencrypt it until im in a vpn tunnel. that plus keyscrambler is pretty good. but yeah cold storage is whatss up. I wouldnt trust a 3rd party either, they do get hacked from time to time. i got into bitcoin to manage my own money. regardless im sorry it happened to ya, and now youve got about 100 suggestions to choose from,(and you know you have to wipe your system CLEAN and start fresh) get a good vpn, learn how to use truecrypt or LUX, for that real heavy encryption. ive never had a problem with my small wallet i use on windows with all those levels of protection. and encrypted my entire harddrive the day i got this computer. but that being said windows is just by far the most open system, lots of attack surface, linux really is far better. OH yeah secure the shit out of your browser because it couldve been a widget w malware or js
