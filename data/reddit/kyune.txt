If my sources are correct, and I've played a lot of video games, she's actually a vessel for a demon lord hellbent on destroying humanity.

I'm not sure in which sense you're referring to, possibly due to a lack of clarity on my part.   I completely agree that Mt. Gox is on the hook for their customers' funds.  My primary concern is one of whether or not steps will be taken once people are done crucifying Mt. Gox for something that could have been prevented, lest history repeat itself.

Consider for a moment that this isn't just a random library or project.  We're talking about a system that is actively courting the world to become financially invested in it (and succeeding, bit by bit!)  
  
I'd like to think that with potentially millions of peoples' finances at stake it would be wise to acknowledge that perfect knowledge and understanding of how things work does not simply exist in the real world "just because there's a wiki for it", and in doing so actively promote design and development decisions that seek to eliminate these problems.  
  
Mt. Gox did it now, but who is to say that it can't or won't happen in the future as more businesses and exchanges spring to life?  Anyone with an account at Mt. Gox that got burned should be holding both parties to blame for the parts of the issue that fall within their scope.

I kind of feel like there needs to be a TVTropes-like website for, uh, real life tropes like this.

I wouldn't be shocked if Minecraft needs to have its resource/information sharing model completely redesigned to effectively prevent this sort of cheating, since performance-driven shortcuts are likely what makes it possible.

Watch "The Middle Man" if you ever get a chance.  Should be on Netflix still, or you can obtain it via alternate means.
