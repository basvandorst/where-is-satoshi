Suppose I'm lost in the wilderness, stumble on an abandoned cabin and eat the last tin of beans in the cupboard there. A month later you stumble on the same cabin, but the cupboard is now bare and you starve. My actions have inadvertently lead to your death, due to our competition for the same resource, but I don't know of any ethical or legal system\* that would treat that as violence. Nor would selling you a pint of beer that causes you to crash your car, or making a baseball bat that's subsequently used in a mugging.
Violence in an ethical context implies an *intent to harm*. If something isn't capable of having intent, it can't be violent. Two crystal seeds in the same solution are "competing" for the dissolved chemical in order to grow, but surely you wouldn't call *that* violence?
\* No modern legal system, anyway. Historically people have got up to all kinds of bizarre shenanigans, including [putting inanimate objects on trial]( but I think most people nowadays would consider that a bit silly.

Given the rough [10% conversion efficiency at each link of the food chain]( it's a bit of a stretch to say that "only a small subset of life" can be nonviolent. By this rule of thumb, at most 10% of Earth's biomass can be *violent* even by your definition. If you don't consider eating plants to be violent, that ceiling goes down to &lt;1%.

Originally I wasn't, but I was responding to this:


and modern legal systems care very much about intent. If you break my nose with your fist, it makes a huge legal difference whether you're mugging me or sparring with me in a boxing ring or having an epileptic fit. Specifically, if there's no intent to harm then there are far weaker grounds for punishment.
