Dear government,
I have recently become aware of a system of rigid logic and formal reasoning that allows nefarious individuals to create arbitrary systems of instructions, formalizing them into algorithms (a term of muslim/terrorist origin) and eventually programs (synonymous with programming  our precious children) that can then be executed (a reference to the violent killing these individuals are known for) on a complex calculating (as in scheming) device called a computer. This rule set, called "mathematics" is a threat to the good people of this nation, who should have no rules other than those imposed by the Constitution! Please do everything in your power to nullify this threat and ban all mathematics from public use! Now, I know that you have to have a majority vote, which does require some of this mathematics, but surely you can find away around this threatening dilemma. Perhaps by just reading signs and interpreting omens.

If rational consensus is central planning, then so too is bitcoin based on central planning. It is entirely possible to learn about our environment and determine the resources available to us. The vast majority are not greedy, and in fact wish to share and help others because that was how humanity has evolved in order to survive. A robot does not need money, so how will you trade with it? How much money does your computer want in order to let you use the internet? Is it greedy? You have not properly investigated a resource based economy, and instead project your own flawed perspective and beliefs onto it.

A monetary system that wall street has leveraged to give themselves the most inequitable lifestyles in human history while starving the masses. There is no blame to assign or evil to point to. There is only the recognition that we can do better than capitalism and that we can abandon the idea of money before it kills us all.

Your assumption that I "hate" anything is incorrect. I "understand" what people in your industry do, and that is why I must point out to all of the wonderful people in this community what the likely outcome of the Wall St./Bitcoin intersection will be. Everything Wall Street does, bitcoin can do better, with more transparency and less opportunity for "service fees". Once people figure out that your jobs are no longer necessary, you will beg the government to put an end to it. This is how the ruling class has always operated, and sooner or later you will come to reject reality and try to enforce your own will to dominate.

There are no central planners, only the use of science, technology and rational consensus. The "costs" are reckoned in terms of reality, not a distorting monetary system. If we understood the amount of resources available, their properties and usefulness and the rate at which these resource could be replenished or recycled, we have a clear idea of the "price" of using them. In the context of a monetary system, in which money can be arbitrarily manipulated (even bitcoin is arbitrary, by definition), then no physical properties or referents are considered, which has lead to the devastation, destruction and deprivation we are now witness to.

Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).
Downgrade warning
Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:
* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.
* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.
If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.
This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.

This is a minor release and hence there are no notable changes.
For the notable changes in 0.10 refer to the release notes for the
0.10.0 release at

anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of
your machine.
0.8.6 Release notes
- Default block size increase for miners.
  (see 
- Remove the all-outputs-must-be-greater-than-CENT-to-qualify-as-free rule for relaying
  (see 
- Lower maximum size for free transaction creation
  (see 
- OSX block chain database corruption fixes
  - Update leveldb to 1.13
  - Use fcntl with `F_FULLSYNC` instead of fsync on OSX
  - Use native Darwin memory barriers
  - Replace use of mmap in leveldb for improved reliability (only on OSX)
- Fix nodes forwarding transactions with empty vins and getting banned
- Network code performance and robustness improvements
- Additional debug.log logging for diagnosis of network problems, log timestamps by default
- Fix Bitcoin-Qt startup crash when clicking dock icon on OSX 
- Fix memory leaks in CKey::SetCompactSignature() and Key::SignCompact()
- Fix rare GUI crash on send
- Various small GUI, documentation and build fixes
- There have been frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems
  during the initial sync.
  Hence it is recommended to use a 64-bit executable if possible.
  A 64-bit executable for Windows is planned for 0.9.

These guys are trying to feed the world through innovative use of technology. The founder is an ex NASA contractor and part of the Zeitgeist Movement. This is one of many transitional technologies paving the way for a resource based economy.

I'm disappointed that Mike Hearn would advocate for the use of blacklists, tainting and reduced fungibility of bitcoin . As one of the significant members of the The Bitcoin Foundation, he has the ability to make this kind of scheme a reality. For someone who just went on a rant against the NSA for violating Google's privacy, this kind of betrayal of the bitcoin user's privacy is really heinous. Who will dictate what constitutes a crime? Who will dictate when a bitcoin will no longer be listed? I doubt that he's given much thought to such questions beyond "whatever the police say", which, in this current political climate, is a very ignorant stance. I suggest those who want to keep bitcoin a viable and fungible currency let Mr. Hearn and all of the The Bitcoin Foundation members know that this idea should not be implemented and produce policy positions rejecting it.

Stefan's recent "debate" with Peter Joseph, founder of the Zeitgeist Movement and creator of the Zeitgeist film series, really did expose some flaws in his ability to think critically and an inability to be reductionist to the point of absurdity. Such strict adherence to principles that have no basis in historical fact or current reality are more akin to religious dogma than anything.

Technology advancement is growing at a logarithmic pace, meaning it is getting better faster than ever before, and will continue to do so. Despite the insanity imposed upon humanity by a ruthless, invalid and destructive monetary system, we have seen great strides in automation, AI and computational capability. As the past has shown, such disruptive technology will become influential and prominent and will enable far greater capacity for humanity achieve such a society. Unfortunately, if most people adopt your pessimism and desire to remain in a stagnant state, then we may not pursue and grasp this reality.

Don't get the doors reference, it's been a while since I read them. The software is actually very much decentralized, which is why it infects and protects everything it touches and runs on. It is only centralized in the sense that bitcoin is centralized, in that one person wrote the software initially. Of course the overall story and capability of the daemon are over the top ridiculously implausible but it's still fun to read and think about.

The great promise of money and capitalism will be borne out to be a lie every time. Going against nature is a sure way to death and destruction. Investigate a resource based economy, an economy that doesn't have to drive many to suicide in order for the few to be rich.
