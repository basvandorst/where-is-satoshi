bitstamp.net seems to be slowly coming up.  Can get to the homepage everyone once in a while, but timesout when trying to login past my 2-factor auth.  Gonna have to give it more time still

I'm in the same boat.  Made a btc withdrawal from mtgox 3 days ago, they deducted it from my balance, but nothing ever showed up at my address. I paid the btc network transaction fee.  I submitted a support ticket 4 hrs after nothing arriving and it took them 2 days to assign the ticket to an agent, who then gave me a generic response:
 "We apologize for the delay. We will escalate to the development team and update you once the transaction is processed."
Now 3 1/2 days later, still nothing. I'm going to try the IRC channel as others suggested.  I already knew I was done with mtgox, hence why I was withdrawing my remaining balance with them, but this is just ridiculous.

Maybe not to much a "substitute" to fiat currency, but rather a supplement to fiat currency.  It's just going to add to the versatility of the economy.  Like a Paypal if you will, just taking it to so many other level.
And yes, gov't banning bitcoins will slow it's progression, but it can't stop it.  Many gov'ts have tried to crack down on torrents and how well is that working for them?  If the world gov'ts start banning it rather than try to understand it and embrace it, we'll forever have a large black market that will happily accept bitcoin (or maybe some other digital currency).

I'm curious on this too.  I was leaning towards 244084264 being the correct routing  but seeing audenx use 021283961 is making me hesitant to commit.
Their page says:
"Use this routing number: 244084264 (for our corporate credit union – Corp One) and this account number: 021283961 (that identifies us)"
I'm confused because it says 244084264 is for their "corporate credit union - corp one", which doesn't sound like the kind of account I opened.  And 021283961 is referred to as an account number, not a routing number...

I just noticed in the footer of pretty much every page at iafcu.org, it says: 
"Routing &amp; Transit Number 021283961"
So that must be the correct one to use...

Yeah... I just noticed it has been a thing before today even:  
Can't wait to be done with gox...

I submitted a 300btc withdrawal just about 2.5 hrs ago (and payed the 0.001 processing fee for a speedy transaction).  Although mtgox is showing a zero balance and reflects the transfer in my history, nothing has arrived to my qt wallet yet. I'm not seeing it in the blockchain anywhere either.   Really hoping there server issues are causing this to simply be delayed.   I cringe at the idea of having to deal with their customer service.

Ah ok. It's clear now. Thx

You get your btc withdrawal yet?  I've currently been waiting 26hrs on large sum btc withdrawal I submitted and nothing has been sent yet.   Emailed their support 20hrs ago and the ticket hasn't even been assigned yet :(.  
I already decided I don't want to do business with gox anymore.  Converted my fiat I had tied up in their exchange into btc for a quicker withdrawal.

Sooooooo...I'm curious, you hit the jackpot?
