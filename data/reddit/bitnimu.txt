it might be high, but that doesn't mean it's inaccurate. The price on clarkmoody is just as accurate as coinbase. They just use different exchanges.

do you need a verified account to use ACH withdrawal and deposits?

learn this as a rule with any valuable asset: if its too good to be true, it is probably a scam. If its not a scam then the reward is probably not worth it. what do they offer? like 0.0001 btc per minute?
save yourself the trouble and just convert your currency into bitcoin.

then i suggest you contact coinbase support. They are really helpful and willing to fix any issues. Contact them first. If they cant help you it might be a problem with your bank.

You can learn from this experience, but that's about it.. Even if you know what address it went to, its just a bunch of arbitrary numbers.. no ID behind it.

well it isn't. I operate a bitcoin website and that free to use ticker is just what i needed.

Good to know, I trusted MtGox with my bitcoin with an unverified account and now my bitcoin are stuck there. I think being able to use your account from only one IP address should not be burried deep in the ToS. Now theyre holding my bitcoin hostage untill i verify :(

You should get a "We accpet Bitcoin" badge somewhere on your site. I didnt see anything untill i was at checkout.

i think it would have taken you the same amount of effort to google it as it did to right that comment.
here you go buddy.

awesome! will definitely be using. Firebase seems like it provides some cool services aswell.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:12:30
coinbase is definitely the easiest but theres a wait period of ~7 days untill you get verified.
i hear campbx is adding ACH soon so it should be as easy as coinbase, but the liquidity is nothing compared to gox and bitstamp.

and when i said, "well it isn't" I meant its not a puppet account. My only affiliation with BTCQuote (if any) is that i will use the ticker and maybe provide a link to the source code so that people know the original creator.
Sarcasm doesn't really work on the internet unless your trying to be humorous or a troll.
