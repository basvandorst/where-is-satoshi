I would be incredibly surprised if more than one person was involved until pretty late in the process (Getting the software ready for public consumption / advertising it).
The idea is so out of the box that to recognize that all of the pieces will actually work in the end (Distributed proof of work + blockchain + transaction signing in an adversarial untrusted context) kind of requires you to understand the whole thing. Just looking at one piece and saying "I wonder if there's a way to make this work" the natural expectation would be that it wouldn't work.

Well, not necessarily taxes, but a levy of some sort. In the US, higher bank fees through most banks having FDIC insurance.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:20:39


That doesn't work at all though... it's not like the bank has a bunch of separate accounts with money in them. They have one central store of money and a database saying how much each person has. If money gets stolen how do you decide who absorbs the loss and in what way? When the bank says "Sorry, some of our money was stolen, and you didn't have insurance... too bad", are you going to trust them? Etc, there's a lot of problems with the approach.
Either the whole bank needs to be protected or not. That's the only way it can reasonably work.

It's not just the $5 wrench.
* Insecure generation of the wallet being used for cold storage (bad random number generator used)
* Accidental destruction / degradation of the cold storage making the coins inaccessible
* Error in transfer from hot -&gt; cold storage (wallet not erased properly from the networked storage for instance), making the cold storage not entirely cold storage
There's a lot of ways it can go wrong.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:40:06
I would sure rather pay a bit more taxes than have the chance of my money randomly disappearing with no recourse.

And how many people know how to properly split up their bitcoin into multiple cold / hot wallets, create backups, create a cold wallet, establish contingency procedures for how others can retrieve those coins if they fall ill, etc?
There are a ton of practical issues that most people will not properly handle.

They don't have the expertise to test whether a Bitcoin wallet works / is totally safe, and I don't fault them for it either. Cryptocurrency is such a new and complex field that they can't easily test it past very basic things.

I would rather put it as... I think that the bitcoin community vastly underestimates how easy it is for someone to slip up once / mess up once / let their guard down once or fall into unsafe habits no matter how "intelligent" they are.
Basically no empathy for basic human nature around here.

AFAIK they're all insured. There's not individual insurance per person. That's what I'm talking about not working. You can't have half of the people in a service insured and half not.

Assuming you can secure it properly. Part of the issue with Bitcoin as a value store is that it's basically impossible to properly secure it right now. There's probably only a thousand or so people in the whole world who can really claim that they can secure their Bitcoin as well as the money they have in a conventional bank is secured.

The Bitcoin blockchain only allows so many transactions per block, and there's only one block every 10 minutes.
If you don't offer a high enough fee your transaction will never complete because other people are willing to pay the high fees and the miners will use the limited space in the blocks for those transactions with the higher fees instead of yours. The demand for transactions right now is much higher than the available space, so the competition has driven the fee up really high.
As for why the Bitcoin blockchain only allows so many transactions per block, and why the number is what it is... that's a much deeper issue.

Yeah... and "Taking part of the currency for their own financial gain because they don't agree with someone's principals" is almost certainly not what *any* of the customers would think is reasonable stewardship of that currency. Nor the exchange operators for that matter... if they *don't* hand over those forked funds they definitely haven't just burned them... they've taken them for themselves for their own financial gain because *they think they can get away with it*, not because they think it's fair / ethical.
It's not ethical because they've taken financial gain away from the customer in return for nothing: They didn't take an any additional risk or anything like that which they haven't already charged fees for.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:34:20
Crypto doesn't help the average consumer at all with that because in the long run the average consumer is going to be using / storing cryptocurrency *through a bank* even if it is successful. 
It's simply too hard for the average user to be their own bank. Hell, I'm a programmer and I would still feel much safer keeping cryptocurrency in my bank if it were an option than trying to secure it myself.

Even if a smart contract becomes legally enforceable... what are you going to do it someone fails to follow it? Is the FBI going to go digging through a bunch of smart contract code and then go out to someone's house and take their money? How are you going to garnish someone's wages to get your repayment on a delinquent loan when they're getting paid in cryptocurrency?
You still need a system of financial institutions to handle the human element.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:22:36
I don't like your analogy. 
It completely ignores the fact that it *is* relatively easy for any exchange that actually has all of the funds that they claim to give the current holders of the Bitcoin on the exchange the forked currency if they don't want to hold an account of both on the exchange. Bitcoin exchanges do claim to be fully solvent and don't engage in fractional lending or anything like that, so there is no issue, they are effectively just directly holding currency for their customers. And even putting that aside, in your analogy, it would would still argue that it **is** unethical for the bank to keep said new currency for themselves, though there may be practical issues involved that make said situation more complex in practice, since they are fractional lending etc.


This is surely not a condition that the exchange wants, they don't want everyone suddenly withdrawing all of their currency. It would work much more smoothly for **both parties** if the exchange just does the ethical thing and gives the customers the option to withdraw their portion of the forked currency.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:39:35
I guess this is a more subjective argument. 
IMO it's such a new space that the exchanges should offer every coin that they have the technical ability to and let the market decide what is a "hostile takeover" or "scam coin". Being such a new space I don't see any way that the exchanges can ethically perscribe which coins are valid and which aren't... it's not like there's established best practices to follow.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:22:06
I completely disagree with what you're getting at there. They actually owe them *more* than in a regulated market.
In a regulated market they owe them exactly what the regulations say they owe them and nothing more, vs in an unregulated market they owe the customers as much as the customers were willing to trust them with, which might in fact be much *more* than the regulations would require.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:21:09
They *shouldn't* have to for every fork. But there's a very clear line between forks that don't matter ("one nutso just wanting to change something") and forks that are relevant (an actual divide in the community). Basically every cryptocurrency fork that has happened has stayed &gt;1% value or gone straight to basically nothing, it's not like there's a grey area.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:45
The whole blockchain is public... so you'll be able to see what *addresses* touched the stolen coins. But that doesn't help you know who actually has control of those addresses.
So, you can only track them if they're stupid. If they send the coins through mixers that can be trusted to not keep any records then there's no way to follow the chain.

@_date: 2017-12-31 02:43:53
I don't see how real world results have anything to do with what they "owe" them. Owe is fundamentally about moral / ethical obligation, the hypothetical.

It's not about "forgetting the password" at all, it's about *securing* the password. Most people can't properly secure a their cryptocurrency seeds / passwords / etc to prevent their funds from being stolen.
Even if you make a stupid mistake and accidentally post a picture of your credit card on social media or something you don't lose all of your money, you can cancel the card, and dispute transactions that were made in the meantime. If your roommate decides to try to steal your money on the way out they may be able to steal something but what they're able to touch will be very limited. It's *almost impossible* to lose your money kept in a bank unless *you* very explicitly go there, carefully bypass all the checks and balances, and do something very stupid.
Wealth in the banking system being hard to move and transactions being reversible aren't bugs for most people, they're features.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:11:43
The fact that really big players still can't get their security right certainly doesn't reflect well on the medium term viability of cryptocurrency though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:38:47


This **IS** an issue with cryptocurrencies though. Security with cryptocurrencies *is* an order of magnitude harder than it is with traditional systems. When you can have money irreversibly move without any human interaction it simply **is** harder to do security, that is part and parcel of cryptocurrency.


Companies like Equifax? Like Sony? They're *only* some of the biggest companies in the entire world. I'm not particularly confident that most companies will be able to adequately secure cryptocurrency no matter how much effort they put into it. 


So, what is careless? Is not using a hardware wallet careless? Maybe. Is not shredding the region of your hard-disk that had a wallet on it at some point careless? Is using a random number generator that was unknowingly not seeded well careless? It's so *incredibly easy* for even someone who does their research to slip up somewhere in any number of the various non-obvious traps cryptocurrency has and lose everything despite being very careful.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:18:08


If by that you mean "The ToS says that they retain the rights to forked stuff" then *no shit*, of course the ToS say that. The ToS **have to say that** regardless of what they actually intend to do in the case of relevant forks. Otherwise they would be obligated to go to the work of handling every single fork, no matter how small or inconsequential, I could fork Bitcoin tomorrow and they would be legal obligated to handle that even if I'm literally the only one on the forked chain.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:10:25
Off-chain only really requires one widespread payment provider implementing a system on top of cryptocurrency as a settlement layer which would then develop into a defacto standard. Businesses don't have to worry about the details because the payment provider does it for them.
Do you think that companies develop their own payment systems from scratch right now with traditional banking? No, unless they're huge businesses they delegate that out to a payment provider. It would likely be the same with off-chain scaling solutions.

The move to bits as a measurement will have alleviated much of the upwards pressure on the price, and Bitcoin will say well under $1000 for a very long time even seeing while significant adoption.

Maybe the hundreds of dollars price range was just all hype, and we're seeing the slow decline down from there to the actual market value as the price memory fades.

@_date: 2014-12-14 09:13:24
Yeah, I know, that's why I'm saying "In practice". It seems to me like in the long term, Bitcoins are very prone to being "lost" through any number of means.
* What happens when people who own some amount of Bitcoin start dying of old age / other incident? What fraction of the current community's coins would actually be recoverable if they were to suddenly die? It seems to me like that figure is well under 50%.
* While the coins themselves may be "durable" the media that the wallets are stored on are certainly anything but. Paper wallets can easily be destroyed or made unreadable. Hard disks, in the grand scheme of things, actually have a pretty short lifetime, same thing with flash memory. A hard-drive or flash memory device left in a safe for a couple of decades has a pretty good chance of being unreadable afterwards.
* Coins being "lost" through IT accidents. I'm sure that as adoption rises over time, there will be some programmatic / systematic errors that cause a loss of a lot of Bitcoins.
Don't you think those are real factors?
@_date: 2014-07-27 05:42:03
The price of bitcoin seems like a giant mess of price memory, speculation and unknowns.
I don't think that *anyone* can reasonably make any predictions about the price. Whether it goes up or goes down, or stagnates for a while longer, there are reasonable explanations for all those scenarios, and whichever one does end up happening will be "obvious" in hindsight.

It has been implemented, but in hasn't been integrated.

I'm not a lawyer, but AFAIK yes, that is legally seizing it, whether you have that control or not. Whether you think the term makes sense or not.
Plus, I don't get what your point is with that control either. The coins are effectively taken once they're demanded, since as soon as you try to use them at some point later they can come after you again even if you refuse to give them up and serve imprisonment in the first place.

You're saying that like it's a given. There's *absolutely* no guarantee that increasing the block size would increase the fees to miners any time in the foreseeable future.
Miners are in it as a business. Businesses want stability / guarantees whenever possible. I don't see why you think that they would value some potential extra revenue that may arrive well after their hardware is even relevant over a guarantee that they have right now.

If anything the problem is more like that it's too *little* to ask for: I really don't like such a stopgap because I feel like it could end up not helping for very long at all while causing even more contention ("We increased the block size and it didn't even help!")  and possible technical issues later.

The main con is that Bitcoin's greatest asset is rock hard stability of the core protocol: Any changes that get made inherently introduce some risk of there being bugs / exploitable problems with those changes no matter how much they're tested, and SegWit is the most significant change so far to Bitcoin really.
There's also my opinion: I'm not pushing super hard for SegWit myself because I don't think it actually solves any of the problems that need to be solved, in that block size increases are only a very short term band-aid and layer 2 networks could still be done even without SegWit. Though I would vote yes if I were running miners because it is a decent technical improvement.

@_date: 2017-08-10 07:19:47
It looks like I used a faucet or something. There was a 0.05 Bitcoin transaction being made to the wallet at the time that I last ran that client (It's showing cached data).
If I downloaded the blockchain up to the point of that transaction then it would show as me having 0.05BTC in it, which I do.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:44:19
Yeah, I don't get how Bitcoin turned into such a anti-government anti-fiat circlejerk.
You don't need to hate on those things to make Bitcoin successful, and if anything that sentiment in the community will slow Bitcoin down. If Bitcoin or something similar is truly successful in the long run it will probably just naturally beat fiat, there's no need to force it.

If you're looking to SegWit to solve the problem you'll be sorely disappointed when fees start going out of control really soon again even if it gets approved. 
Any possible to pass block size increases will not solve the problem of full blocks, especially not with basically any new adoption happening. The bottom line is that there's just going to be a lot more demand for transactions than can reasonably fit in the primary chain regardless of how big the blocks are.
@_date: 2017-01-01 09:13:36
You realize that these taxes go both ways.
If your Bitcoins decrease in value and you sell them you can declare a capital loss and pay less taxes.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:38:20
I feel like this is entirely semantics.
SegWit as a concept itself does indeed not do anything to make blocks bigger: The particular implementation being shipped in the current SegWit update just results in a modest increase in capacity.
I think it is correct to say that "SegWit does not make blocks bigger".
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:21:00
It's not.
What Bitcoin provides is the **option** to be your own bank. There's nothing to say that you have to use that option for everything or 100% of the time.
@_date: 2016-11-21 03:57:58
In what way?
Popularity / existing infrastructure / devshare matters in a massive way. I don't know how you can discount it. If all of the technology and users already exist for smart contracts in the Eth ecosystem before things are developed on the BTC blockchain then you're going to have a hard time getting people to switch over.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:31:50
I disagree.
20c (not to mention that there's no reason to believe it won't go quite a bit higher in the medium term) is enough money that it will psychologically feel like spending a real amount of money to most people, which is a problem for Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:34:44
That's not really true.
The *new* supply will half in that time. A doubling in price would assuming that the rate of new demand remains constant, which there's really no reason to believe: It could swing pretty widely either way through mass adoption or through saturation of the market of consumers technically knowledgeable enough to be interested.

AFAIK some form of off-chain network is not blocked by lack of SegWit. SegWit just makes an implementation slightly easier, but is not strictly necessary.

I mean as a service. The underlying technology wouldn't change but in banks offering storage of and monetary services using Bitcoin just like they do cash.
I would put my Bitcoins into a bank in a second if it were an option. I trust them to be able to secure them way better than I ever could.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:20:10
Doubling (More accurately about 1.7x IIRC) is modest. How long do you think a doubling will buy before blocks are full again?
If there's any of the sort of pick up in adoption people keep predicting then they'll be full again in no time. When transactions are cheap people will use up the space. I bet it wouldn't even take a year for them to be full again.
I'm not saying there necessarily should be an even bigger block size increase (In fact, I'm against increasing the block size much at all because it doesn't solve anything in the long run), but as far as how helpful a 1.7x will be, I think the answer is not very.

Anyone shuffling currency into an extremely volatile risky asset like Bitcoin on short term time scales to escape another "weak currency" is out of their mind.
I don't buy that there is anyone actually doing that, unless there's such strict capital controls that it's all they can get.
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:17:38
A lot of the pools with the most development / infrastructure behind them have enough above 5% share that they have complete control over if a switch will happen though (since they alone can block it if it comes to that), so I don't buy that as a good point.
@_date: 2016-11-05 09:52:23
Difference of opinion I guess. As a programmer I **do** think that something like Saicoin and Bitcoin *are* very similar.
* They're similar in terms of implementation challenges, for instance scaling and security wise.
* They're similar in terms of how the community around them develops and works.
* They're similar in terms of financial and sociological behavior of the people using them.
Really the only different thing about most Blockchain technologies is what end they're trying to accomplish with the project, but a lot of the stuff along the way is *very* similar for most projects.
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:33:12

@_date: 2016-12-02 09:04:08
The very good reason being that since Bitcoin is such a new and novel thing that nobody has prior experience with people are much more likely to treat it wrong than basically any traditional personal finance issue.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:10:35


Yes, that *would* be the case, if the maximum fee where people stop paying for transactions were too low... but that clearly isn't the case, even the current fee is substantial enough per block to be worth something to the miners, and that's the lower bound, it could go much higher. You're right that at some point the fee will stop rising, but you're wrong that people will suddenly stop paying the fee at all at that point or something like that. It will stop rising because it has met an equilibrium, at which it will stay, or rise further from in the future with more demand. It won't reach a breaking point and suddenly drop off a cliff for no reason, it will just stop rising at some level.
I would wager than the fee could go *significantly* higher than the fees for banks / credit cards and the blocks would still easily fill up. Most of the people using Bitcoin for transactions right now are hard core enthusiasts that use it even though it's not actually the best tool to use for what they're trying to do, and for them it won't matter if the fee is fairly high.
And, even putting all that aside, *even if* you think that it isn't in the miners best interest... clearly the miners think otherwise, and it's what they think that matters in the end.
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:03:28
The fact that SegWit is so controversial and might not be politically viable is *part of* the scaling problems I'm talking about. If every little set takes so much controversy to go through I just can't see all of the pieces getting into place to make scaling work well enough for mass adoption any time in the forseeable future, whether it's technologically viable or not.
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:12:33
I'm not exactly against it, but I don't get why the push is so big for it, given that it doesn't really solve any of the "big problems".
The layer two networks are what's needed to *actually* solve things, and there's a ton of work to do on those before they're anywhere close to being usable. Not to mention that they could still potentially work just fine even without SegWit.
If I were running a node I would vote for, because it is a net technical improvement, but I have no complaints to those who do vote against it, and don't think it will actually hurt Bitcoin in the long run if it doesn't pass.
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:51:55


I don't understand how you *don't* think that it could be potentially problematic. Literally our entire global economy, from fractional reserve banking to monetary policy involving setting interest rates is based around lending, and changing to a deflationary system is a massive change in that area.
Changes as small as half a percent on interest rates can have *massive* effects on the economy right now, and moving to a deflationary currency (Even assuming it had a completely stable value, and didn't inflate in value at all) would effectively be a change of a whopping 5% on every single loan (Given that global inflation rates for the last century have tended to be around that much), how do you not think that that would substantially change how things work?
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:53:47

People **did** want it to take over that role for the last several years and assumed it would though. Look at any number of posts from the last few years and people **were** arguing and upvoting posts suggesting that it would take over that role.
It feels very dishonest of the community to, now that issues have caught everyone off guard, suddenly move the goal posts to try to act like they haven't.
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:18:26
Why would anyone hold that position? There's no advantage to "wait and see", what percentage are supporting doesn't tell you anything useful. Either they're going to upgrade and support when they have the time or they're opposed for whatever reason and a simple percentage supporting isn't going to change their mind.
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:27:40
Except for literally the very end of hyperinflation scenarios where the money has basically no value at all anymore Bitcoin currently is much more volatile than and state fiat currency.
 That's not a problem in the long run because with more widespread use comes more stability, but it absolutely is a problem for early adopters trying to use it in business.
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:46:35
How does that address either of my questions?
@_date: 2016-11-05 21:51:38
Well, we can't know *for sure*, but given the very low success rate of the various things in the crypto-currency space, it would be a losing strategy to do all the work to create something like Ethereum unless you were actually excited about the technology.
Just alt-coins with slight adjustments? Sure, some of those may be made with the intent to scam, but for any of the more significant projects it seems very unlikely.
Obviously being one of the early adopters / developers has some potential monetary incentive even for those projects, but I don't think it has anywhere near enough that you would undertake the project just for the money.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:41:25
To get people using Bitcoin. If you were a miner you had a large incentive to promote adoption since you were holding onto a pile of coins.
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:07:05
What to they have to lose exactly? I think that you're vastly overestimating how much the miners care about Bitcoin going up in value. They probably care way more about cashflow on average than speculation.
In fact, they have more to obviously lose by not blocking, because they're raking in transaction fees which could very well drop if they pass it.
There's potentially single interest Chinese farms that have &gt;5% on their own. It's not even like a pool would be needed to block it. And that's assuming that the pool participants actually care enough to switch pools over the blocking, which I doubt many do, they're happy as long as they're getting their money.

**IF** SegWit activates. Taking it as a given that it will activate at this point is wishful thinking.
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:12:22
Again, the miners don't care about "relevance". All that matters to them is that the electricity and infrastructure cost of mining is less than the block reward plus the transaction fees, and making the profit on that difference as large as possible.

Technically speaking? Nothing. Either one can be used to exploit you if you use it without understanding it and trust someone's implementation.
The difference is only practical: Bitcoin scripts are simpler so they are less likely to be accidentally written in a exploitable way.
@_date: 2016-11-05 09:08:06
Very unlikely in the foreseeable future in my opinion.
My view is that Bitcoin has gotten exposure to most of it's "natural" market (technically savvy people who are willing to deal with all of the really tricky security measures necessary to hold / use Bitcoin) and found it's market price at this point at a price on the order of magnitude of $1000. Basically all of the prime candidates for Bitcoin enthusiasts have already been reached at this point.
It would take some very significant change in course to push it to new groups / markets, and I'm not really sure what that would be. Even if the scaling problems can be solved (I'd say that this is an IF, not a when too, politics may keep scaling from ever being solved), the security concerns around bitcoin are just too great for it to be anywhere close to ready for new non-technical users.
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:40:28
That's kind of stupid.
Absolutely nothing has changed since then. If anything things look more unstable as real technical / political problems in the ecosystem start to rear their ugly heads rather than there being a nice clear path ahead as there was at that point.
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:00:56


What makes you think that they are actually interested? They are supposedly aware of it because you made them aware of it. It's not exactly hard to buy Bitcoin if they want to.
That's the situation with most of the technical people I know. They *are* well aware of Bitcoin but just not interested in it because it's not useful to them.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:33:23
But "failing to gain critical mass" isn't a problem, there's clearly enough demand just from the "nutters" to fill up a block as is.
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:43:53
It also means that all the people that are hyping mainstream adoption should recognize that it's an absolute pipe dream right now if Bitcoin *already* can't even handle the scaling problems even with the absolutely tiny amount of adoption it has so far.
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:57:05
Uhhh... no thanks.
I *hate* holding Bitcoin myself, I would put it into a reputable bank account in an instant if it were available.  I'm even a programmer who's dabbled a lot in writing exploits and I *still* don't feel particularly good about my ability to really secure my Bitcoin.
Being your own bank is so incredibly hard and risky to do properly, there's no reason to do so if you're an average Joe.

If flow in is generally less than flow out then the mempool stays small. If flow in is generally more than flow out then the mempool can balloon in size very quickly.
The difference between the flow in being bigger or not is not that large.
It could simply be increased usage reaching the breaking point for the current block size.

That's such a cop out. There's basically zero impact they could have to whatever issues there are for them by contributing.
The only thing that really matters right now development wise is lightning network, and that could take millions of man hours of work and years worth of time to really be ready for use. Not to mention that the pool of developers who are even qualified to do the dirty work on that system is pretty small, it's not exactly easy work.

It seems like a pretty reasonable complaint about the development effort from them that the developers are so split.

This is a very unhelpful way to put it.

@_date: 2016-11-25 08:41:38
For one, SegWit in and of itself doesn't make scaling happen on it's own (other than being a very brief stopgap by offering a bit more transaction space), all it does is offer some tools to future scaling solutions. There's an entire layer two infrastructure yet to build which will probably take years.
But like I said above, whether the technology is possible or not is beside the point: There's still a question as to whether *even SegWit* will be enabled because of the consensus being considerably split. If we see similar political division on every scaling topic I don't see how we'll get to be ready for adoption. If anything getting layer two working will be yet considerably more politically problematic than SegWit because it relies on building trust agreements between a lot of different parties.
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:53:29


The fact that all the posts about "helping out the pool people with cheap micro-transactions" and what not were *massively* upvoted suggests that you're talking about the majority of the community, misinformed or not.

I don't know how you think this is so clear. 
What's to say that Bitcoin won't still be hanging between $500 and $1000 for the next year too? There's literally no precedent on which to value Bitcoin, it seem unwise for the miners to assume that the price will rise significantly over taking **sure thing** that there's almost no chance of the transaction fees dropping if they take the status quo.
Remember that miners are fairly risk adverse: They're making big infrastructure investments for fairly stable return. If they wanted high risk they would probably do something else with their money.

We're barely a month in, but every additional 10% is potentially exponentially more difficult to get than the last. It's not like there's some linear rate of progress that you can extrapolate here: As adoption increases you're going to be hitting less and less willing blockers.
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:57:52
I don't get what you're not seeing, what I'm talking about is simply the expected outcome, not some exotic effect:
As the percentage of people signalling yes grows, the people left over will naturally be the people who are less eager to update... or else they would have updated sooner instead of waiting. And that effect grows much much stronger as time goes on, because the remaining people are less and less likely to be willing to update at all if they haven't already.
That's what I'm talking about, simply that "already at 30%" or whatever is a bit of a misnomer in terms of the "already", because the first block of yes voters who were eager to update and did it right away is *significantly* easier to get than the rest.
The last 20% or whatever of holdouts that will be very hard to convince are really the only ones we should be interested in, so "already at 30%" is kind of irrelevant. Those 30% were the "freebies", they were already convinced even before the change was ready.

Yes, which is why I think that it's highly unlikely for this blockchain stuff to really catch on. It's *way* to big of a liability.

60% is too little for me to bet, I think there's a decent chance it could get there. 60% is possibly achievable given time for pools to make a move and modify their infrastructure. I think the last 20% or 30% (one or two big pools, plus Unlimited, plus random small miners) or so will be the really hard part.

How would an economy based on a deflationary currency even work? Wouldn't everyone just hoard their money most of the time rather than lending it out? Right now economic activity gets generated by people lending out their money in some form to save it from inflation.
It seems like everyone using Bitcoin would make it seriously hard for anyone to actually get capital in order to do business and thus destroy the economy since everyone is just safer holding onto their money.

My argument is that a block size increase *isn't an improvement in the first place*, it's just a stopgap. And one that may not even help for very long I might add, it would barely take any additional adoption to bring us back to the same situation with a modest block size increase.


IMO there is no problem with private companies getting into providing layer two services. Bitcoin's power is the *option* to be your own bank. Not the **requirement** to be your own bank. The way I see it the easiest way to get mass adoption is realistically companies providing layer two or higher Bitcoin services wrapped in a nicer UI.


My opinion as a programmer is that one block size increase as a stopgap is pretty likely to lead to further block size increase stopgaps in the future. And if you go down that route it will also lead to increased centralization / other difficulties in the future because you can only make the block size so big before it becomes quite technically challenging to actually run a node.

@_date: 2017-04-14 09:39:04
Because increasing the block size won't solve anything. The bottom line is that Bitcoin can't support as many transactions as it will need to (given what people want it to be) no matter how big you make the block size.
Doing an increase may even hurt overall progress because it will remove the pressure to actually get Lighting Network or something similar working as soon as possible until the fees become high again.
SegWit itself is a technical improvement that there isn't much downside to. Block size increase is not an obvious positive.

This is probably our main disagreement. I don't think it will alleviate problems for long enough to be worth the risk: I bet that fees would be significantly on the rise again in as little as a few months thanks to the market gobbling up the new capacity really quickly after fees initially plummet.


In what way. I stand by that statement: Some layer 2 solutions, whether from private companies or community developed are more likely to emerge faster if the fees are high. It's just basic economics, the higher the price the more incentive there is for competition.
If that competition is another cryptocurrency that's simply including more / bigger blocks, then that's not really a sustainable solution, and I don't see that being much of a threat to Bitcoin.

Something that makes me suspicious right away reading the white-paper: Why is there a crytographic puzzle at all an the system?
In existing networks like Bitcoin the cryptographic puzzle adjusts in difficulty to the network's hashrate, but the puzzle can't in this system: Suppose that a small IOT node wanted to issue a transaction in Iota, it needs to be able to solve the cryptographic puzzle to make any transactions. Given that it's an IOT node it probably doesn't have that much processing power, so the cryptographic puzzle can't be that hard.
Now, we have an attacker in the system: Their node is almost certainly multiple orders of magnitude more powerful at solving the puzzle than small node. So, for their node, the cryptograph puzzle is almost trivial. But then what's the point of having the cryptographic puzzle at all? Cryptographic puzzles aren't worth anything unless they're actually hard for the person trying to attack your system.
I don't see anything at first glance that addresses that problem, and it makes me doubtful of the quality of the other stuff.

Silk road **alone** had literally 1.3% of *all the Bitcoins in existence at the time* on it when it was taken down.

This is operating under the assumption that there is one standard cryptocurrency that everyone is using.
If cryptocurrencies become common, and say that you got paid in a cryptocurrency, it would be exceedingly easy to transfer that value to another cryptocurrency (given that the barriers to setting up an exchange would be very small compared to with traditional currency). So why do you think that one cryptocurrency would dominate everything?
I would expect that in the case where cryptocurrencies become the primary store of value there would be a multitude of competing ones that serve different interests better by making different technical tradeoffs (fast transactions, vs cheap transactions, vs complex scripting ability, vs stuff we haven't even though of yet etc).

Copy of my other reply:


This is correct, you could build / maintain local networks. But that doesn't matter for Bitcoin. Once the disconnected localized chains diverge the blockchain as a whole would be pretty much irreparable.
Bitcoin loses all of it's value as soon as any partitions happen. You'd have no way to know whether coins were being double spent on the other side of the partition, so you couldn't safely accept any coins.
It would also take an extremely long time to rebuild the internet. The inter-continental fiber optic cables are very complicated and expensive technology, you'd have to reach an extremely high level of sophistication again to even begin to rebuild them. Not to mention all the various peering agreements, management layers, and politics involved in the top level interconnects.

@_date: 2017-05-17 22:09:05
I have no idea why you're being so pedantic. Don't you get what I mean? The signaling level is stable and unlikely to change much any time soon... what do you call that if not a decision?

We're talking about a societal collapse which kills the USD's value, which is a totally different thing.

It may not be entirely accurate quantitatively speaking, but the fact remains that Bitcoin's dominance almost certainly at the lowest level that it ever has been compared to other cryptos no matter how you measure it.

How is this not more upvoted? This is easily the best explanation of cryptocurrency ever made IMO at least for people with some amount of technical knowledge.

"No changes" is an option, and in fact likely the safest one out of all the options.

Except for all the times that this subreddit upvotes "Bitcoin's market capitalization is now bigger than X's market capitalization" posts of course.

That's an interesting problem... I'm not sure what the solution to that is.

But what overlap is there there? Why would a prepper be more likely to hold in Bitcoin than cash or gold? If anything I would expect them to value holding gold a lot more than Bitcoin.

More like are you willing to play Russian roulette with *your* investments.
There are plenty of other cryptocurrencies willing to pick up the slack if Bitcoin falls apart. Crypto isn't going away, it would only be a minor setback.

This is correct, you could build local networks. But that doesn't matter for Bitcoin. Once the disconnected localized chains diverge the blockchain as a whole would be pretty much irreparable.
Bitcoin loses all of it's value as soon as any partitions happen. You'd have no way to know whether coins were being double spent on the other side of the partition, so you couldn't safely accept any coins.
It would also take an extremely long time to rebuild the internet. The inter-continental fiber optic cables are very complicated and expensive technology, you'd have to reach an extremely high level of sophistication again to even begin to rebuild them. Not to mention all the various peering agreements, management layers, and politics involved in the top level interconnects.

I don't know how you can argue that something that only a vanishingly small fraction of the population even have is a "necessity". Hell, only 60% of the population even *has an internet connection*.

It's only frictionless, or functional at all for that matter, as long as you have a smoothly functioning internet.
In a true societal collapse scenario the internet isn't going to last very long.

That's not what I mean. If ASICBoost came up I'm sure other further patentable optimizations on ASIC mining will come up in the future, potentially giving one origination a monopoly on profitable mining.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:25:53
Right now there's always enough of the internet connected reliably enough that there's a completely obvious "main chain" that can overrule everyone else once things get sorted out, which will happen pretty quickly.
The issue would come if the network were divided in such a way that there were two or more roughly equal parts, and / or if the division happened for long enough, since it would be very hard to restore a consensus if any divergence happened while the disconnection was in place.
@_date: 2017-05-08 04:15:02


Implying that there's a 100% chance of the "worthless" chain being as worthless as you're anticipating.
Obviously if your assumption is that one chain will quickly die off then it is safe, but that's quite the assumption to make. Even for Ethereum where there was pretty strong consensus, ETC is still worth about 10% of ETH, hardly worthless, and there's no guarantee things will even turn out that well.

It would be easy to make money off of a large scale attack: If you had a large bankroll you could short various other altcoins for large amounts, because a sucessfull attack one BTC would hugely shake confidence in the whole blockchain ecosystem and take prices down a lot.

To be fair, Bitcoin has relied almost solely on the block mining reward for most of it's lifetime.
That won't always be the case, in fact, it will pretty quickly become not the case as the mining reward decreases.

During the last lull there was plenty of demand... that didn't stop the price from stagnating for more than a year.
You do usually need a significant *driver* for demand... just people gradually becoming interested isn't going to suddenly push the price up a ton.

I would bet that equating one wallet = one person is off by *at least* an order of magnitude. Most people have multiple addresses, quite a few probably have 10 or more, and some even have more than a hundred.
That's not even counting services like exchanges that make piles of addresses while shuffling around funds.

Implying that forking in that scenario is an invalid choice...? There's nothing wrong with making that choice, it has both upsides and downsides, and it only went through at all because it had majority community support.

Modeling relies heavily on calibrating against past outcomes to tell whether your model actually has any accurate predictive power.
Literally every economic system in history has been deflationary, and moving away from that changes way too many things to really have a good idea of what will actually happen in that case.
At least that's what I've gathered asking various people about it many times over the last few years. I'm not an economist.

Something that makes me suspicious right away reading the white-paper: Why is there a crytographic puzzle at all an the system?
In existing networks like Bitcoin the cryptographic puzzle adjusts in difficulty to the network's hashrate, but the puzzle can't in this system: Suppose that a small IOT node wanted to issue a transaction in Iota, it needs to be able to solve the cryptographic puzzle to make any transactions. Given that it's an IOT node it probably doesn't have that much processing power, so the cryptographic puzzle can't be that hard.
Now, we have an attacker in the system: Their node is almost certainly multiple orders of magnitude more powerful at solving the puzzle than small node. So, for their node, the cryptograph puzzle is almost trivial. But then what's the point of having the cryptographic puzzle at all? Cryptographic puzzles aren't worth anything unless they're actually hard for the person trying to attack your system.
I don't see anything at first glance that addresses that problem, and it makes me doubtful of the quality of the rest of the stuff that they're claiming.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:13:35
Why do people think that transactions would be so much cheaper with only a small block size increase?
With how expensive transactions currently are I would imagine that people are being extremely careful to make as few transactions as possible, and that the block would fill up quickly even if it were increased in size and prices dropped a bit. Obviously the price would be lower, but I don't think it would be an order of magnitude lower like it used to be.
