lol nice comparison. It would be valid if we were talking about Bit torrent and half of seeders were from China.

His argument is stupid. And saying fees and confirms times are not a problem is also stupid. Exchanges using batching imo would be more useful than Segwit at least short term.

So is for shitcoins. POW does not give a coins value just for that. Especially when the price per coin decides how hard is to mine no the other way around. Even 1 ASIC mining would get 10 coins every 10 mins. 


And in POS?


Better Sathosi then some mining farm.


From the ledger's perspective is exactly the same in POS. Every new block new coins come into existence.
I am not saying POS is better. It's definitely more fair, it remains to be seen if it can replace POW.

Now? after 6 months?
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:13:01
What do you mean? You need coins to stake more coins. So if the coins have value it is costly. And everyone can do it even the little guy. As opposed to mine bitcoins.

Good luck convincing the local shop to take crypto. I rekon it will take years. This card is perfect. No one even knows you spend BTC.

Good for you. Especially if you love your job. My wife is the same.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:15:47
TenX is a 3rd party and they advice to only load on the card what you intend to spend. Still, until fully mainstream this car is great. You can go abroad and you don't need to stay in line and get ripped off when you exchange to local currency. You can also withdraw from any ATM. If you withdraw USD/EUR/GBP depending on your card type, you will pay absolutely no fees. Not even currency conversion, which are huge 3-5% when you withdraw other currency than what your card has. So if you use it at home and you pay something other than USD/EUR/GBP, you will suffer one currency conversion to your local currency.

To be honest withdrawing from ATMs might have some fees, that is the case with any card unless the ATM is from your cards bank. Other than that you should get Bitstamp price when you withdraw.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:37:31

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:11:44
Of course humans make the code, what I think he mean was the fact that we can create code that automatically enforces actions. So the trust is shifted from trusting a human to trusting a code. This shift works especially well when: you are dealing with strangers and the code is open source and stood the test of time.

@_date: 2017-03-19 22:47:08
One more is not enough. Another 25% would be something.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:55:15
Are you saying they are spamming since January? Even with 20k in mem pool is took 12 hours last time to confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:43:50

@_date: 2017-03-05 23:34:50
So are you saying is that an approval would increase volatility? Also for institutional investors to short they have to buy first no?
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:31:40
What dump
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:10:41
I really don't know. But every payment I make makes me more frustrated. I checked only 20k transaction in queue. I payed 75 sat/byte as 0.49$, after 3 hours I saw the recommended is 240 sat/byte. It took 16 hours to confirm.
There was always a fear that Bitcoin will get competition but the argument was that Bitcoin can adapt and adopt any feature a competitor comes with. Let's hope will will have a solution soon. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:22:26
The hashrate will always adjust depending on the price. Then there are different types of mining algos. This makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:32:05

@_date: 2017-03-05 23:23:45
It is because of the port. Still maybe you exaggerated saying it takes weeks. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:46:06
For individuals connected to a pool it's just the number of computation sent to the pool and the total hashrate of Bitcoin is an approximation based on how fast the blocks are found at the current difficulty.

@_date: 2019-03-08 00:36:28
Have you verified your nodes(if you have one)/wallet source code? Have you verified your hardwares wallet source code? Have you inspected the hardware components of your hardware wallet? Every hackatron they find new attack vectors. How do you go about verifying Samsungs wallet code and Android/iOS vulnerabilities? Maybe if it's open source. How do you verify the components in the Samsung phone and decide there is no attack vector and the private key cannot be extracted by opening the phone? You cannot.

To imply Bitcoin was robbed of MoE when the split happened and that people left (and will never return) because of high fees era is beyond ridiculous. Almost no one is using(or were using) Bitcoin for merchant payments because it doesn't make any sense at least for now. Exceptions are the dark net payments and the unbanked. There are way better MoEs. Paying 10% higher rate(which my local processor takes) to have questionable proof of payment in case you get screwed over and risk data collection/doxing from the processor makes very little sense. And for what? So we have a high transaction count and get our payments instantly converted to fiat? Bitcoin should be used as MoE but where it is needed and there is no alternative.

@_date: 2017-08-17 22:58:24
Well obviously "has done a great job supporting bitcoin" is not referring to scaling since there was no scaling in Bitcoin ever. They worked 1-2 years on Segwit, rest of the work was not scaling related.  
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:12:12
I don't believe Bitmain will continue to mine a Segwit only chain. He is the final boss and we are not prepared to face him.

I doubt they will mine a Segwit only chain. They have enough money to survive. And what will be the value of the Segwit chain if 90% of the hashpower leaves for the 2x version? What will happen to confirmation times? What if they will mine until diff change then leave while the difficulty is sky high? Then do it again next time? Segwit only chain needs POS to survive imo
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:38:09
Miners believed 2x will happen otherwise they wouldn't have signaled Segwit. So UASF just made them hurry a bit imo it wasn't a decisive factor
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:19:05
You should always try to get more BTC. Fiat value doesn't matter unless you want to cash out. So if your trade nets you more USD but less BTC imo it is a bad trade because eventually BTC will rise and you have less of it. You buy with BTC, you calculate your profit in BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:56:00
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:10:09
Why check the price constantly if you are not selling? If you invest in alts though BTC movements matter though

What % of transactions do you estimate will be Segwit few days after activation?
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:57:17


Yeah cause the miners will just gladly mine the current chain. Even if they leave for BCH, there is still a hf required.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:24:43
Why Core can't continue to work on Segwit2x? Exactly which miners will get the picture? Those that signaled Segwit maybe, that's 30% or so.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:03:58
Can you explain more? I find those 3 arguments rather dull.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:34:16
฿0.073020 on Kraken. Better than expected.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:47:01
Well you can make a case that if Segwit people refuse the 2x hardfork and big miners move to BCH, the price will rise and then we will have true coinwarz
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:27:39
Pretty much.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:13:38
You can say the same about 1000 people
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:41:16
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:33:04
They refused Segwit for almost 2 years but then they were defeated by 1000 or so nodes with no hashpower and almost no economic entities on their side? Why didn't they think to launch a UASF themselves if it's that easy?
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:24:38
You bought around 15 July which was at the very peak. Also you do not mention NEO which grew like 10x since then
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:52:43
I agree with your post(including that 2x was rushed and COre are the best developers), and that was my only remark that Segwit2x may have the majority of users(not sure yet how to verify that). We tend to hear from the same UASF people that claim they single handedly defeated the big miner cabal. And of course these people will object to the 2x fork and if they fork they most likely have to switch from POW, they have no chance against the miner. I am curious what the miners will do, will they switch to BCH or mine Segwit2x? They must have seen this coming and have a backup plan.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:08:02


Yeah cause miners will gladly mine a Segwit only chain.
There will be a fork. Either to 2x or a split. Unless miners decide to go to BCH
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:48:24
You believe most of the miners will support 2x? Or go to BCC? With staying on 1MB being the 3rd options, what probability do you assign to those 3?
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:37:34
The actual event i.e activation is weeks away. So we may still be in anticipation
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:28:24

How is the fact that BTC is divisible or not a confusing thing? Should we call it Divisible Bitcoin so everyone understands right away without them bothering to reasearch anything? No one should buy BTC before understanding it. We don't need our bags pumped just for the sake of it.
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:22:07
Even if you find someone with a miner that he is willing to rent to you, ask this: why would anyone do that if it is profitable for them to mine? There is no reason. And if you find a way to  invest 100 dollar and get 10 dollars/day back in Bitcoins for 30 days would you ask someone on Instagram for $100 or you ask a friend and make the money yourself?

@_date: 2019-06-04 21:29:40
I see where you are comming from but it's not that simple. First, not many places take BTC. If they do they have around 10% premium. Second, even if you use BTC exclusively, you are still holding since many people have thousands invested not peanuts. Third, these processors are gonna dump your coins on the market. But I agree that this could be just a required phase for adoption. 4th. Tax issues, doxxing yourself buying silly things online etc.  I personally use a debit Visa that I can top off with crypto. Hits all the right spots atm.

I wasn't aware they are continually dumping premined coins. But it doesn't matter, the fact that they can dump on a price so high is because people are required to buy the token and driving the price up. Mybe they don't dump premined coins, they just released the initial amount from premine. I didn't say this is not sustenable as long as they have coins to dump and Bitcoin is on the rise. If BTC goes to 1k tomorrow, assuming they keep their money in BTC, will they be able to pay if a lot of people withdraw and don't lend?

1) As in you can use the protocol without permission, that also includes the code to fork. These forks attract newbs at first that want to get free money, there is nothing you can do about that. Forking is a feature not a bug.
2) Agree with you. But I don't agree with OP that these forks don't do any service. They do exactly what they need to do. Split the community. The fact that every Dick and Morty is doing his fork is not an issue as long as people don't give it attention. Plus you can't do anything about it so why mention it

You are so retarded that the moment someone disagrees with you they must be on the opposing camp. A sympton of the times we live in I guess. I was just pointing the retardation in your logic.

Well even now many farms use electricity that would be wasted otherwise. Mining could become the defacto in areas that produce electricity and are not connected to the grid.

It's not about penalization per se, it's about getting rid of the exploit so miners can be more objective when judging to support a protocol change. Otherwise, all changes have to keep the exploit or they will be immediately rejected. Even if you think Segwit is not a good example, maybe your next favorite improvement can't be deployed because it will mess the exploit and will never see the light of day.

There is no way to know that just by looking at addresses.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:43:32
The 12.5 BTC is inflation. To say the holders pay for that is like saying the 1-2% you lose yearly in fiat is paying for the government/monetary system to run. Which you can make a case for. But in Bitcoin inflation is 1)know from the start to the end 2)necessary for a)incentivizing miners to secure the network b)to reach total supply since we started from 0 coins in circulation. Without inflation we would still be at 0 coins.
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:39:03
Obviously because of risks. The whole point of crypto(if you believe in it and you are not just a speculator) is that you can control it 100%. At least keep the stash off exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:39:55
The only way to insert arbitrary data is the OP_Return memo field. Or a coinbase address but you need to mine blocks for that.

Store of value doesn't mean you use your rent money or money that you are gonna need short term. Maybe with gold, but not Bitcoin which is very volatile but you take it because you don't care what happens short term and the upside is huge. BTC was a good store of value for 9 years minus the last 3 months. Also you don't go into a store of value when it went 3x in a month. I imagine very few that bought in the parabolic move were buying to store value. They fomoed in to gamble. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:24:44
Very few merchants hold coins, those that believe long term. What happens if a big player starts dumping? The price drops. Coins get more distributed which is good.

I am deluded. Where are those "concrete" examples? At what block number? How do you put an image when the OP code allows only 80 bytes? They stated: "In an online forum this image is claimed to show child pornography, albeit this claim cannot be verified". They also did not verify the links themselves. I can see someone putting there sensitive information like nuke codes. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:44:48
They had tens of thousands of BTC in 2014 after that bubble so I assume they still hold most of their gains in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:40:47
Of course it's a gamble. One bug or regulation could crush crypto to oblivion. But like I said everything is a gamble. Gold, stocks, real estate, your education etc. It's about risk/reward.


Well that depends. Many people I know that are working are borrowing money left and right and it's usually for stupid shit they don't even need(which imo is worse than gambling on something you believe in). If you can pay the debt and the interest is decent then it's fine. Borrowing at high interest and without an income that is quite tricky to pull off.

Cause no one is using Bitcoin. We have almost 50% less daily confirmed transactions than a year ago when the price was 2k or so. The drop coincides with the price decrease so it's not due to batching.

You may be right, we are arguing semantics though. Bitcoin does not satisfy the definition of money yet people are using it as such. Same for store of value. You may argue it's not store of value, it's speculation. Not sure how you decide which is. For a believer it's store of value(some say investment), for an unbeliever it's speculation. Could be both at the same time. Of course volatility is not something you want in a store of value, but volatility is both unaviodable and necessary until a marketcap into trillions. You can only reduce it with artificial rules that remove the free market aspect. Gold was pretty volatile when the Gold standard was removed and it went through a price discovery phase. Gold price

Well even if regulators crack down on the currency aspect of crypto, I reckon companies/startups can still issue their shares on a blockchain platform like Ethereum. I don't see how this use case can go away, although it is a paradigm shift, I have friends that buy bitcoins through brokers which is crazy old nonsense. But being so easily tradable, those shares could be used as currency. I for one after using crypto don't believe we are going back.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:19:03
What's that? We are talking about everything on chain 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:15:55
There is no FUD. Maybe the general "Bitcoin is ded". We stretched more than the blanket allows. We went from 6k to 20k just because of the futures market which did nothing. On chain metrics are at July's levels so this boom didn't give us much adoption. Going back to the means, maybe even below that which is gonna be a great buying opportunity.

Every investment is a gamble. It might pay off, it might not. And it is different then going to a casino. You have more control(using stop loss, waiting for a good entry, dollar cost average, take profits) and as opposed to the casino the risk/reward ratio can be greatly in your favor. In a casino the risk is guaranteed to be bigger than the reward since the house is always a favorite.

Nice sheep mentality you have here. Care to look into it or just relax and be spoon fed? The obvious cause of low transaction count is batching but there is no batching evidence. Who started batching a month ago when we had over 350k daily? It seems output did increase since a year ago but not to explain the drop. Also USD transaction volumes are in Sept-Oct area.

How exactly is it overvalued? If there is demand? Sure, many buy them with debt and the materials+work+land is way cheaper than the building. But how do you quantify if it's overvalued?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:26:22
Not a good one IMO. The fact that resources have to be spent to get it doesn't mean it's backed by those resources. And even if we agree it is backed by those resources doesn't mean it is worth something or has any value.

Your address  1Nyw2e1Bzw8yxBE73ZsStfteXNwmLogfgY  received many payments from other addresses. When  1Nyw2e1Bzw8yxBE73ZsStfteXNwmLogfgY  makes a payment it has to reference an address from where it received the funds. After choosing an address that made a payment to  1Nyw2e1Bzw8yxBE73ZsStfteXNwmLogfgY  bigger than what you want to spend, all the coins sent from that address are spent for the payment you want to make and the excess is sent back to a new address your wallet generetes and it is controlled by you. This new address does not appear in your list of addresses. In your case, your wallet choose to spend from a transaction of  1.0054932 BTC, instead of smaller ones. Why? No idea. Depends on how to software wallet is set up.

Decentralization is not some utopia we have to subscribe to 100% it is just a mean to gain some properties that are desirable as: immutability, permissionless, uncensorable or transparency things that digital assets/tokens did not have until Bitcoin. The fact that you need to use centralized systems to either acquire, trade or spend crypto does not take these properties away, more than that they are unavoidable for now at least. What is the problem paying crypto for something through Bitpay? Why would I care it's centralized? Should we wait for decentralized companies before we can spend crypto? What is the problem using a credit card connected to your crypto wallet? Should I wait years for the local shop to take crypto? Ohh it's centralized like everything we used until now but now we want to go directly to decentralized services 100%, we can't bare the though of having $100 on a centralized service? Sure, a lot of people leave their crypto on centralized services and they are doing that at their own risk. Like having money in the bank.

From coinmetrics.io "Daily on-chain transaction volume is calculated as the sum of all transaction outputs belonging to the blocks mined on the given day. Known “change” outputs are not included. Estimation difficulties remain and the measure is imprecise."
Now they say the volume is 5.5 Billion daily now, while various other sites state the volume is less than a billion daily.
So I'm not sure which is the correct one but it's not 10 billion like the guy said.

Bitcoin is and will be inflationary for a long time. The exponential price movements are because: free market, small marketcap, speculators usually young and unexperienced, started from zero value/coins.

How would it looked by now if it didn't fail? Everyone pays their coffee and store all their value in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:06:11
That would create a gap between Binance - Bitstamp. The gap is small now due to people dumping alts for USDT lowering the price on Binance.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:17:45
History shows store of value precedes medium of exchange function. Also imo the short term goal is not to replace Paypal but to use BTC where there is no Paypal or banks. Later, when many get their salary and store their value in crypto they will use BTC instead of Paypal.
@_date: 2018-04-02 01:40:54


Well you can buy it from another person but then you are gonna say fiat itself is centralized. Sure you can do some work for bitcoins so no fiat involved but still the majority are gonna buy it from an centralized exchange. But why is that an issue? Is the goal to not touch anything centralized ever or you are not hardcore enough? What is the problem buying coins from an exchange and withdrawing to your wallet? How do you envision the transition to a new system when everyone's wealth is in the old system? 


ICO boom and darkmarkets would disagree.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:29:29
They are part of the problem if you want Segwit. The empty blocks don't really make the confirmation times slower. They are too few.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:47:39
Bitcoin is and will be inflationary for a long time. It has to rise in value because it started from zero. 


Everyone has a price when they will want a house, lambo etc. 
Just holding is nonsense but sound economic logic so far said a currency starts as a collectable&gt;store of value(we're here?)&gt;medium of exchange&gt;unit of account. Of course it's a feedback loop between SOV and MOE, like when drug users were using Bitcoin purely as a MOE and that gave some value to the SOV aspect. But imo SOV is more important at least in this stage. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:21:16
If the store of value aspect gains traction more and more people will want it. And when many people have coins then more and more companies will take them. But imo Bitcoin's goal is not for us to buy stuff for which we can use Paypal/credit card but use it where either there is no alternative or the alternative is more expensive and slow. The West does not have a payment problem(besides drugs or payments to remote countries) but it has a store of value problem as equity/real estate is imo super inflated so I believe the medium of exchange use case will be 2-3rd world countries. These countries also have a store of value problem either because of hyperinflation or the fact that they are un banked.

"Core could change the proof of work algorithm to something that isn't mineable by ASICs." Again what are you talking about? if the fork happens the B2x chain will be controlled by other entity than Core.

You should research how this works. It's a risk they take to find an empty block in 4 seconds. They either find it or not. If they would have picked transaction before, they wouldn't have find it.(actually they could, but it's a very slim chance to find a new block in 4 seconds)

I don't care about BU. Spam or not the network should not be in this state. But as far as I know 0 fee transaction are rejected instantly. Also most of the transaction in mempool are 100 sat and up.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:33:37
With the current network state it is clear to me this is pure speculation. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:41:42
ETH is second, I don't think it has any competition among alts. But this feels like a pump. Last time we saw these prices was because Bitcoin went down to $950. 
I don't know about most of the alts but there are a lot of them that have potential. Most of them don't even compete with Bitcoin, so I don't know why people insist on holding. 
Yet this feels like a giant bubble. I mean they can't ALL go up can they? I would expect this if Bitcoin was back to 1000, but that's not the case. Where is this money coming from?
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:39:46
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:21:22
So with 228k transactions in mempool, paying $2 will get you a confirmation in the next block?
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:21:48
I meant IF they pay
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:49:16
I was expecting proof from nullc as he reverse engineered it. 
If I recall correctly Jihan said he likes extension blocks. 
Anyway I don't believe Asicboost is used. He has the best miners so if Bitfury is profitable then for sure he is too. Waiting for proof though. 
And he opposes Segwit in fear of LN.
In these times when everyone already picked a side and has a bias I don't believe anything until there is proof. Look at politics. They criticize the other side and not one bad word about their side. Any media, journalist, blogger etc that only barks in one direction is not worth to consider imo. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:43:08

@_date: 2017-05-15 00:01:31
Ok but it should make a good fee estimation. Or you want me to do a research every time I make a payment?
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:22:58
That was a month ago. 10 cent fee transactions are confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:06:33
He might be on profits if you calculate in USD but is he in profits if we calculate in BTC? I highly doubt that. So he should have bought and hold.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:45:12
Where is the fix? Segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:47:43
Ok empty blocks might be a sign but where is the proof? Maybe I've missed it. I haven't seen the reverse engineering process.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:34:58
I can already see the news tomorrow.
