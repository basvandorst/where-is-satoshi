I'm on the toilet right now reading this, lol! It would need to be able to show all multi-tasks too in order to be accurate.

I decided to spend the time confirming that you spelled Rubik wrong and then it finally completed in Coinbase. Thanks!

Well, I can say that where I work, they implemented a no tobacco policy and so it takes people literally 20-30 mins to drive off campus to have a smoke. They would be more than happy to go right outside and decrease it to 7 or so minutes.  So a huge increase in lost time is being caused, at least where I am, by the policies, not the smokers.  I only go out one time, during lunch, personally, but I have a vape :)

No, scared of what?! If it crashes so be it, if it doesn't then yay!

He still is.

I just replied to a similar post with my experiences. But I will say that the smokers should not be going out longer than their entitled break allows. That's not even about smoking but rather taking extended breaks which would be against policies and thus can result in consequences.

Which is truly unfair...what about people who eat too many Twinkies and Doritos? Should that be applied to them too? Not saying you agree with it or not, but just pointing this out.  If companies discriminate against one unhealthy choice then they could start doing it for all of the big ones...like big drinkers.

I recommend learning the process with a very small amount (even like $50) so you can learn what you are doing without worrying about losing your money. 
And no, don't invest all of your savings! Only do whatever amount your are willing to lose!
Hope this helps, but to answer your question, no its not too late! Though you may want to wait a little to see if there is a correction and price goes down, but there is certainly risk it just keeps going up and corrects higher than where it is now...so it's a gamble.

Regardless of what this was for, this is amazing!

Yes, you'll still have the same amount of coin whether the price goes up, down, or stays the same.

Maybe that was a sign for you to HODL???

I cannot agree more regarding all crypto. Trying to even explain it to folks is hard enough. I am a pretty computer savvy person and I've continued to use Coinbase because of its simplicity. I look at the wallets and mnemonic codes to store and fear I'll do something stupid and lose my funds. I think Coinbase is a good step in that direction but not sure they do not market it this way, especially when most people recommend offline wallets. The mainstream must have a simple and and safe method if this is ever to become mainstream. Hey, maybe we should go into business together...?

Here's my prediction: It will go up, followed by it going down, followed by it going up, then down, then up again, followed by down, then up, then down, all the way until it goes up............then down some more, then up again...

Sounds like a nightmare that turned into a wonderful dream!

I put in $200 around 4400...will this really ever amount to much even if BTC went to 50k? I own 4.5% of a coin...so that would be worth $2250...ceetainly a great return but not a lot of money...i think I have to invest a lot more...?
