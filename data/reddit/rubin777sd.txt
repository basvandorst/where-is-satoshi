Went down to $3,600 around 9am Pacific standard time. I think it's the articles circulating about China and the CEO of Chase talking smack.

Honestly I don't know at this point. US tries to regulate anything they don't understand especially when it deals with money. They try to get their hands on everything that's new. I think they should simply stay away from this market because it's none of their business. A few reasons why they might want to regulate cryptocurrencies include taxation, cracking down on crime, and things of that nature. Most people would believe that the US wouldn't be able to regulate this market but with their past history with other things I wouldn't be surprised that they do regulate it.

My advice would be not to rush, I'm doing 20k but waiting for the right moment. Hopefully around $3600.00 just missed it at 9am pacific standard time.

That I agree with, they will try to and I believe they already have, tried to discourage people away from purchasing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because it's not in the best interest of the government as well as the major banks. Don't forget these banks simply control the government. I think the biggest reason why the US government wants to regulate the market is due to taxation. Is there any government agency that can prove you own bitcoin? One way they will try to get this information is by regulating exchanges such as coinbase.com, they will most likely pressure these website to release user information on purchases and sells in order to tax individuals on their gains. Think about the usual stock market exchange websites, they require you to prove your identity and provide a social security number in order to report your gains or losses to the government. When you don't pay for taxes you get audited and then your going to have a major fuck fest with them. I think they will start with bitcoin since it's the most popular among them and then slowly creep into others.
