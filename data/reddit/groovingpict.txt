It's basically a ponzi scheme: there is no real value behind the currency other than people investing their own real money into it. Unlike state-backed currencies, which is tied to actual value creation. It's like a text book ponzi scheme, and like all ponzi schemes it is just a matter of when, not if, it will blow up in everyone's faces.

The difference being that neither of those are claiming to be a currency...

Im not saying it's reached its peak, Im saying it is definitely a bubble that will at some point pop and pop big, and that it looks less and less like a currency with each passing day.

Oh I get it, it's a "new type of economy"; gee, where the fuck have I heard that before I wonder... * cough*dotcombubble* cough*

That wasnt what the bubble was about: the internet existed long before that socalled "new kind of economy" emerged (turns out it was just a familiar old bubble though)

I get what you are saying, but in making your comparison to gold you are also implying that bitcoin will forever be a commodity and never a currency. Which is kind of the point Ive been trying to make: that bitcoin isnt working as a currency and likely never will even when and if it flattens out and settles (which it isnt going to do btw, it's going to burst like a bubble and the only unsure element is when it's going to happen and not if it's going to).

And we dont tie our currencies to gold anymore, for very very very good reason. What you are saying that in a best case scenario, bitcoin will function like the gold standard? Thats a huge step back my friend, not a step forward.

So is it starting to sink in that it's a bubble yet? As a currency, it's not very stable is it (stability goes both ways)? It doesnt work as a currency when everyone who has it wont spend it because in a few short months it will be worth 20% more. Thats not a currency. Thats a bubble speeding head on into a crash.
