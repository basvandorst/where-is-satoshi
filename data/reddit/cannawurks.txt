I’m sorry I meant ban exchanges or regulate them to death, making it much harder to buy, sell or use. GitHub just banned Iranian users.

The Govt. doesn’t care about hypocrisy. I just think it’s something you guys need to be discussing instead of this sub being all memes.

BTC doesn’t rise at all, it’s just that the dollar goes down.
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:25:08
Duly noted. Very good reply, and yeah I agree, it might be a good thing.

We have a lot of them here in my city, they definitely get used, have no idea what kind of volume they're doing or if they're profitable though.

I don’t blame you, $100/ounce is a really good price. I have no choice personally, thc gave me panic attacks.

It’s actually not us, the plug in we use has a bunch of altcoins attached. Don’t even really know which ones. I’m a btc purist myself.

Processors charge up the ass for cbd businesses or anything considered "high risk".

We ONLY accept bitcoin on our site lol.

They're about 3,500 usd for base model.

I'm currently using Bitcoinpay.com!
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:28:04
I want to accept as many cryptos as I can! How would we set up LTC XMRE and ETH? I can't find any services that are similar to BitcoinPay that will let you completely bypass the application process and broker the transaction with html codes etc.

I'm actually considering going with Wordpress and using woocommerce. But I've been so busy with work I haven't had a chance to even work on the site. Also, my payment dilemma exists even if I use woocommerce. I'm also setting up a site on wix since it's free just to test it out. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:29:07
Can this happen to anyone? Even today?
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:12:26
I ask every stripper I meet if she accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:23:19
Yes they do have integration but the companies they go through require applications and most likely won't allow cbd businesses.

It's CannaWurks.com. But the site is vey new and only has two products listed so far and it doesn't look very good. Getting more products soon but I work full time so it's kind of tough doing everything. But we will sell what we have on the site so far lol.

India is running out of drinking water. BTC to the moon!!!
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:02:12
Not well I shut the site down. Didn’t make many sales but I also didn’t market it much tbh. If you wanna start one up again a let me know. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:21:24
Don’t think that can happen. Inflation would be ridiculous at the point. Actually it can happen, but then that $1 million wouldn’t be able to buy much, so there wouldn’t be a point to having $1 million dollars if it can’t buy anything.

Had no idea so many people in this sub run bitcoin atm businesses since those are the ONLY people that should even be commenting on this post.

Actually it’s plenty for one btm.

You mean the 2018 correction right?

We need to be careful. If bitcoin gets too big America might come and bring freedom to us.

He's right you know.

What sell-off? That tiny 10% hick up? If that's a sell-off to you you're in the wrong place. A sell-off is when it hits exactly $0.

Someone in the Monero sub said this was back in 2018 and it never got anywhere. Anyone have more info?
