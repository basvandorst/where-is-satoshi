I think low fees are more of a threat to bitcoin at this crucial stage as it gains wider adoption.
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:16:24
You could hold coinxbt in registered accounts for ages.  Just takes a little more leg work.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:16
Sure thing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:26:32
I think we should wait until Bitcoin is solidified trading on futures exchanges.  Too many variables changing while entering a new stage of adoption is not good for anyone except those who wish to destroy BTC.
@_date: 2018-09-21 15:39:01
You're right, but following that it other sources backtracked on it.  It's nice to see someone who's invested in Bakkt say that this is back on the table.

Amazing, thanks!  Follow up question you may be able to help with.... Do you know of anything with exposure to alts? Like a traditional exchange traded iconomi or something?
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:53:23
Calm down, and be aware that you are in fact regret trolling whether you intend to or not.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:09:45
You are completely missing the point of his tweet.  The proportional difference between 3-5 is the same as 3000-5000.  It has nothing to do with quantity of coins bought.  He's insinuating there is so much growth left that just getting in is the best thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:36:23
I do see what you are saying completely it's just that quantity of coins has no bearing in the original tweet.  It's a fiat denominated example and I've spent too much time on this.  Have a good weekend :)

I actually agree with you, centralization for a lot of db's makes more sense right now.  Who knows though in the future, couldn't blockchain advance to a place where friction is minimized and efficiency is maximized?
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:53:39
Back when the internet was in it's infancy many couldn't see what it would go on to become.  The majority of information lives on the internet now, lots of it is still gated but it's there simply for ease of use, transferring, sharing, collaborating and manipulating.  The same could happen with databases.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:25:26
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:46:03
Seriously, who cares if you blame him or not?  It's his life and he did the most rational financial decision based on the current information.  These regret trolls are the some of the biggest knobs in the crypto world.

This guy speaks for all scoffers apparently.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:05:45
Is this a threat to growth?  If people bet on a crash they’re incentivized to see that happen, will this tank bitcoin?  I’m just trying to understand the potential threat this poses.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:58:39
Huge congrats.  Have you looked at  as a way to participate in the future gains and get your new pad?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:49:56
It appears no one in answering.  Shame, you'd think with so much money on the line that this would be at the forefront of people's minds.

Asian countries sometimes do 3D re-enactments of news stories.  My guess is that it’s from that.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:23:25
Exciting headline, but nothing will come of it for the reasons I've already stated.

I just bought some, so it should fall significantly shortly.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:02:08
Not quite, someone or more likely a group of people and corporations purchased a specific BTC backed stock on an exchange and used JP Morgan for these transactions.  It's not just as simple as saying JP Morgan bought these shares.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:03:55
Same way you move $10 worth of BTC.  
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:29:22
There is no crime.  This is just uneducated people trumpeting a fun to repeat talking point against someone they perceive as an enemy of bitcoin that isn't factual.  
If JP Morgan was directing their customers to purchase BTC or shares in a BTC backed fund after the damaging statements were made in the press, then I would agree with you, but those facts have not been presented and I would find it extremely unlikely that they are nefarious or wise enough to pull off that scam.  However if there truly is evidence of this I will accept the facts instantly.  But until then I'm not jumping on the pitchfork bandwagon.
They are just facilitating a trade, this could simply be individuals using a web based brokerage platform to purchase shares the same way people use etrade.

I paid for movie and popcorn to my brother in law for 0.2 BTC... Over $1000 at today's prices, thankfully it was an amazing movie and worth every penny. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 01:43:34


Clearly, I don't think anyone reading your comment needed that disclaimer.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:46:39
It's a publicly traded instrument.  You think if a CEO doesn't pull access to stocks based on his personal opinion it's a crime?  If you do we have nothing left to discuss.
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:41:53
I'll give igadjeed the benefit of the doubt and assume they're a troll.  No one can be that closed minded.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:16:01
Exactly, it's clear at this point that the established banking industry does nothing but leach from society.  Even when they are caught afoul of the law, they blatantly try to weasel out of it even then.  Put these guys in jail and let peer to peer lending and decentralized trust take over.  It's about time society outgrew this corrupt and obsolete model.

I feel like a business of their sophistication would absolutely be able to spin up to scale on the turn of a dime.  What benefit would there be to turning away potential customers?

Btc and eth decoupled in their movements earlier this week.  Now eth is up at the expense of BTC.  Meaning a lot of folks are jumping ship.

Anyone doing TA based on the memeconomy?  Seems like the good memes really come out to play and in huge numbers above 9000.  It's very silly but I actually wonder if you could correlate reach, sentiment and quantity of memes to actual price prediction.

Scaling is exactly a problem you can just throw more devs and more servers at.
