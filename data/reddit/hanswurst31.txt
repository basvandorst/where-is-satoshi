no their not. they screwed it up 3 times. 2 times i bought btc at the weekend and the whole weekend the status would be "sending". till mondoy when the support where availible. this friday i bought some bitcoinn and the idiots managed to not forsee that they have to use a higher fee because the chain was allready clogged up. i was lucky that someone from the support where there but guess what. they said:"sry but we cant help you" they could opt out double spent and there are a few more  methods. now i have to wait till tomorrow so i can tell them how shitty thei are and that i will sue them.....sry but im angry. they playing around with your money
