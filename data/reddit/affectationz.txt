Damn! I bet that was a great day! I got excited over finding 0.05 BTC I didn't know I still had.

For example BTC market cap is $121 Billion, so to significantly MOVE the price one way or the other you'd need 10% of that or roughly $12 billion -- so nice theory but math says no.

No one has enough money to buy enough Bitcoins to create this much price mvmt/manipulation. The numbers don't make sense. Great conspiracy theory though. I like it. ;)

Veteran here who has now worked in a few corporate jobs. Corporate America is actually MUCH further behind than the military when it comes to technology and upgrades. (I was surprised about this). I'm guessing because lives actually depend on it, not just profit.

I've done the same in the past but created a ticket had to upload my drivers license and selfie again etc...I think 48 hours later or something I was good. Don't give up. They are just inundated with new users right now.

I've referred people too and never received the bonus -- neither did the other person. Seems like a scam. No response from Coinbase either.
