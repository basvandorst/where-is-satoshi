The chart I look at from time to time is the number of Blockchain wallets. Although people may have multiple wallets, its a great little indicator and gives you faith in BTC's growth.

As a baby boomer about to retire, yes we have had it good... different times though and different norms... I am hoping the fiat charade will last till I fall off the perch, but think not.

Hope you guys have a better chance of stopping your countries going to war than what we had.... good luck

I have had the same question running through my mind. I have a handful on btc on Gox. When I heard through a reddit that they were laying off staff I managed to get a number off the exchange and the rest got stuck. I then also moved the fiat I had there into BTCs. I have tried getting fiat out of Gox.... impossible. From my point of view the chances of getting btcs off the exchange are hugely greater than getting fiat.
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:51:24
As a 64 year old I concur with what you have said. Discovering bitcoin and the blockchain was so exciting.
I wish I was as young as the OP to see where this goes to. I think I may have done the same as him if I was young and footloose.
All the best OP, I envy you!
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:50:55
Confidence, it all comes down to confidence in any currency, be it fiat or bitcoin. In a financial collapse confidence will flee from what has collapsed and be directed to currencies that are perceived to have people's confidence.
Presently wealth would flee to precious metals but as bitcoin/litecoin develop their reputation they will also become a safe haven. If a financial collapse is a year or two into the future then Bitcoin will begin to dominate over precious metals.
A financial collapse will be bad for everyone. It certainly pays to have some insurance outside of the traditional financial instruments.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:00:06
PPC has a 1% inflation built into it.
I think your arguments re deflation are wrong. People want more spending power, not necessarily more quantity of fiat representing less spending power. It will take the populace sometime to comprehend this as we have been indoctrinated the other way.
When looking at the long term future, I believe that coins have enough flexibility to be modified to handle any threat that comes along, as has been the case to date.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:22:30
Great buying if you can get fiat into Gox. May not see it again but worth a small amount. Gox is using Mayzus now I believe to get money into Gox accounts. Good luck if you try, let us know how it goes.

Although Max Keiser can't keep his mouth shut asking someone on his show a question, I owe him a huge debt as I heard him talking to someone in Argentina and they discussed Bitcoin..... this was around 15 months ago.

Getting USD onto BTC-E and Stamp cost me about 6-10%, getting it onto Bitfinex cost me 2%.... not sure if that has anything to do with it...
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:42:25
Before bitcoins I went down the root of gold and silver, mainly silver, the main element of wisdom from that journey was that 'you should invest 10% of your wealth in precious metals and hope like hell it doesn't do well', I thought that was sound advice so I don't worry that PMs are dropping.
 Two years ago I came across bitcoin, what a mind blowing experience that was.... and I have supplemented that wisdom with 'invest 5% in bitcoin and just hold onto it'. I now have 15% outside of the banking system and not susceptible to counter party risk. 
Just sitting back and observing now.

@_date: 2014-07-08 21:39:06
Simplest way to get bitcoins is to open an iGot account. Then you can transfer money to iGot's BNZ account and start buying bitcoins. Overall you are paying about a 3% premium than on an exchange but when you look at move funds overseas and all the ticket clipping that goes on, then 3% is pretty good.
If you are looking in the $10,000 range then Bitfinex is the best and most reasonable exchange to use from NZ.... good luck and maybe see you at a meetup in Auckland sometime :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:59:43
Bitcoin is a slow burner. Its takes a reasonably long gestation period from hearing about it, getting interested in it, then deciding to buy some. A couple of months I would say..... Giving paper wallets with a small amount of bitcoins can accelerate this, doesn't have to be much.... try it :)
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:21:05
I cannot help feel that we will retreat to a more primitive form of doing things as was done when gold and silver were used.
With our fiat wealth, this is in banks usually, so is being used to capitalize production for a small return of interest. This automatic background function needs to be developed somehow within the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:55:55
Every time I mention bitcoin to a friend they still have not heard of it, or in some vague way, some lite memory.
We are still at the beginning, we are still the early adopters.
Because it has been a while since bitcoin made a big move does not signify boredom (5 short months). Some things take time, people have forgotten how to pace themselves.
If you think Bitcoin is boring , go and play the NYSE...
Bitcoinis just starting......

The price will not drop, miners will stop mining until the new balance is reached. Miners are not idiots. They will come back in when it is worth their while..... so the price will go up.

My charting suggests the bottom of this present cycle will occur around early April, then a steady rise reaching its peak in mid May, with BTC reaching between $2000-$3000. (LTC following similar pattern reaching $130-$200).
BTC dropping back by Mid August to around $1500.
Thereafter another two cycles may occur before the end of the 2014.
Will be interesting to see how these projections pan out.....

LTC is the next most likely to be around. People want choice an options, VISA would do so why have Mastercard, etc.
Also often LTC goes down as BTC goes up and visa versa, it can help stabilise a portfolio
I think you are doin the right thing. After BTC and LTC, well who knows..... good luck

I think Governments can really slow things down and make its adoption spread out into the very long term, but they will ultimately fail to stop it. It has too many advantages for the people.

Mike sees gold and bitcoin as insurance. Insurance is something you do not want to claim as it means that the bad event you were insuring against has occurred.

From my experience of being on Boards, you do so to assist with moving the organisation forward. Lately I see people doing so to screw the organisation and gain status for themselves by being perceived as revealators of the truth by the rest of the bitcoin community.(sections of which are only too eager to read such)
Normally you allow sometime to get bedded in on a Board before shooting off you mouth to the world. As a Board member it is not your personal view that should be broadcast to the world but the voted on position of the Board.

Pity about the Swarm failure, was looking forward to participating in the first ever election on the blockchain and be part of history, never mind, I have voted using the Helios system.
Worth a shot with Swarm though, next time maybe....

I know this may be a naive question, but if bitcoins are as traceable as some argue here, then why when some have been stolen that the thief is virtually never caught and prosecuted?....

What a brilliant statement. Wish I had thought of it!

I sent some money from NZ to BTC-E via wire transfer, it was converted into US$ at NZ bank (ASB) before transfer, by the time it arrived in my BTC-E account the banks had clipped 9% and btc-e 1% so total clip was 10%. Hence one of the reasons for price diff between btc-e and Gox. Maybe using localbitcoins is best option. Good luck...

salient advice, to just hold whilst its falling apart is the hardest part, I have bet someone that by end of 2014 it will be $10k, still believe I will win before June 2014!

We need to build into the Bitcoin infrastructure processes that allow getting wealth into bitcoins. Wealth that is not dependent, or less dependent on banks. Perhaps a gold/silver/bitcoin exchange where the movement of fiat into the exchange has multiple paths. (fiat to gold, gold to bitcoins)
If China had indeed banned their banks from dealing with BTC exchanges then that would have been it, too easy!

You should be on the trollbox at BTC-e, a much better locale for this FUD

Watching bitcoin and the market is addictive. Great lessons on price movement to be learnt. Accumulation of coins is my only strategy, what is is against fiat is not a priority.

Thanks ashray, glad I cancelled my Mt Gox with drawal then as would still be waiting. I think hold on withdrawals at BTC-E maybe due to me having to supply them with ID..... will find out

Things are looking grim for you guys in the US, bail-ins will be the order of the day before 2018 I reckon...... actually in a lot of countries. Thank goodness for precious metals and bitcoin!

Hey Gavin, if you have a spare night/afternoon in Auckland, interested in joining the Auckland Bitcoin Meetup group for an hour or so? Let me know and we'll spring a meetup into existence.... bitcointradernz

What I have done is put 10% into gold and silver coins, mainly silver. Put 5% into bitcoin, left it for six months, then withdrew twice what I had put in. I have left the rest (which would be 10 times what I put in originally) and am letting that ride for the long term.
Whilst market cap is $3B, no worries, once it gets to around $100B Government/banks will get really worried, till then things should be good.
