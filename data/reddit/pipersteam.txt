Do you know which episodes specifically? Just gotten in deep with JRE. thanks in advance!

I'll run with it.  JR probably laughed when he saw your username and was like man whatever this dude says, goes.

Shutup really?!? Love Joe Rogan this is going to be a great listen.  The topics Joe discusses are so beneficial and diverse.  I was anti podcast guy until about 3 months ago and I can't get enough of the powerful joe rogan!

Print won't be available until June 7th, paris time.
Sign up for the email list from printthemall.com and also follow both that site and artist on instagram for the latest updates.
Not sure if it will be an instant sellout or not.
Hope that helps!!

Square is quietly becoming a force in crypto adoption.

Gorge run this year was a thing of beauty.

Cash App (Square) is going to be here for a long time.  
They're trying to sell BTC adoption to the masses, they do a ton of advertising (joe rogan experience and others).
Would be worth a look at their stock, IMO.

It’s street art so it MUST be banksy...
@_date: 2018-11-08 13:44:43
Yep. Very crazy right? 
I tend to be in the crypto space for risk / reward but I’ll be damned if I don’t invest a little in square for real long term.

I laughed way too hard at this.
