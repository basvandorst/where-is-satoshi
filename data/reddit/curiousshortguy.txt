Rejecting and destroying a $100 tip and demanding the ~$4 tip in USD seems more unfriendly. It's not like he offered something hard to monetize or worthless instead.

Under that definition, they key feature of fiat is given by
* the obligation to accept fiat currency
* the attempt to prescribe the value of the currency you are obligated to accept without backing
A private agreement between us to do a transaction in cryptocurrency does not depend on the outside party forcing us to do it or to do it at an (implied and abstract) rate.

I didn't get any. Are you sure you got the syntax right? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:38:00
I think you're the one either trolling or clueless:
check this out:
An activity involving physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often undertaken competitively.
An active pastime; recreation.
As well as
(General Sporting Terms) an individual or group activity pursued for exercise or pleasure, often involving the testing of physical capabilities and taking the form of a competitive game such as football, tennis, etc.
(General Sporting Terms) such activities considered collectively
(General Sporting Terms) any particular pastime indulged in for pleasure
Taken from wikipedia, which says "The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport."
SportAccord has bridge, go and chess in their list of associations, moreover the definition goes as follows.
SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:
have an element of competition
be in no way harmful to any living creature
not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football) not rely on any "luck" element specifically designed into the sport
In particular, they also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).
Your narrow minded, KNH driven definition is just coming short to reality. Sorry.

It's interesting how you got bashed in the orginal thread for leaving a tip in non-US dollars. Since a tip is voluntary, it seems to be clear that the tipper gets to choose what to tip, and you can't DEMAND tips.

Awesome, I didn't even expect a reply at all. Regarding and the FAQ


I kindly disagree, since my statement was slightly different. I'm not arguing that bitcoins are worth what you needed to put into it to mine them, I am arguing they are worth at least what you currently, at the moment you want one, need to spend to get one.  Although this is still different from the underlying market value. I never really understood that aspect of fiat, any "precious" metal could have no market value at all too.
* any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
* state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
The definitions I understand refer to an intrinsic value besides the state prescribed one, and I think the costs of producing a replacement if no market value is available is quite a good number. The english wikipedia says:
* money without intrinsic value
linking to intrinsic value, which states "An intrinsic theory of value (also called theory of objective value) is any theory of value in economics which holds that the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic or contained in the item itself. Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value".
That's basically what I described. A coin is not worth what it used to cost to produce it, but it is the minimum cost to either produce or acquire it at this very second.

I don't like the quiz and they way it presents answers.
* Who has the ability to reverse Bitcoin transactions? 
If there is a majority amongst the miners, they can do that.
* Who controls Bitcoin?
Is a bit sketchy, since, as fair as I know, most nodes still run with the "official" open source program which gives that group a bit chunk of power.
* By accepting Bitcoin retailers must take on the pricing volatility risk associated with Bitcoin's value. 
They must take it on, but they can mitigate it using third party services.
* What is the safest way to store a large amount of Bitcoin?
Paper wallets? The house can burn down, they paper can be lost, stolen or physically damaged. I'm not convinced it is a lot better than my rooted phone.
* In which of the following ways is Bitcoin different from traditional currency like the US dollar? 
Whether you regard bitcoin as fiat strongly depends on the definition of "fiat" you choose. No intrinsic value is not the only choice, and you might want to define the current intrinsic value of a bitcoin, just as done with gold, the current mining costs, dependign on the price of electricity and network difficulty.

What? This is so wrong it blows my mind. Mortgages are (property-) backed loans, which can be done in Bitcoin just fine. With fixed or variable interest, nothing is a problem. Why wouldn't it work like that?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:13:23
The fact that there are serveral altcoins has another advantage: it needs more heads and competent people to write infrastructure, which brings more talent into the cryptocoin world. Regardless which coin will win, it's better to have more compentent people working on it.

Just because they physical activity in chess happens in a part of the body you either do not posses or do not know how to use correctly doesn't mean there is no physical activity.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:08:06
Just because you are uneducated doesn't mean chess or computer games are not sports or esports.

Just having a college degree does not make you smart, sorry to bring that to you.
Almost all esports are much more than just mental activity, it still seems you have no clue what you are talking about.

That's the spirit, you just need to send an expiration date on your own live.

It is considered a sport. Just because it is not in your head, reality does not change for you.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:45:07
There is an important difference between (not) wanting and being able to have. There are also other ways to implement it instead of just nominal amounts, e.g. by referring to a basket representing purchasing power. A mortgage contract could read that you receive 100 times the purchase power of a reference basket, paid out in bitcoin, backed by a property. You have to pay back in bitcoin, again referencing the purchase power basket.
I really see no issue in constructing mortgages or derivatives thereof exactly modeling what dollar nominated ones do.

I suppose you should use this as a reason to immediately cancel your contract and stop payments.

Just reading the rest of the thread and saw that you turned from narrow minded to transphobic, so for sure I will laugh and enjoy the show you deliver.

So you come up with one random definition for sports and think because you have a KNH degree this is the only acceptable one?
For the sake of not just trolling, check this out:
2. An activity involving physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often undertaken competitively.
3. An active pastime; recreation.
As well as 
1. (General Sporting Terms) an individual or group activity pursued for exercise or pleasure, often involving the testing of physical capabilities and taking the form of a competitive game such as football, tennis, etc.

3. (General Sporting Terms) any particular pastime indulged in for pleasure

Says fiat is an intrinsically useless medium of exchange. Since we can use bitcoin for more than exchange, it might not be intrinsically useless.
I'd be very happy if your fist question referred to the backedness by physical goods instead of fiat, but I'm fine either way. This just started out with me explaining my thoughts on your quiz, which is a nice thing to have.

You have showcased your lack of knowledge on esports a number of times and still keep trying to re-define well-accepted meaning of words as well as commonplace definitions. That's certainly a sign of intelligence.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:18:39
I'm not sure who gave you that degree with your bad grasp of language, concepts and the lack of ability to think abstractly. But you're welcome to waive around your degree that relates to a subsection of sports and pretend you know it all.
Just take a look at the etymology of the word "sport", the definition by SportAccord or look into the world dictionary of English to figure out that computer gaming is not only "esports" but frankly "sport" according to all of these definitions.
