Well, then it's not almost like they vanished at all.

Why would the person who stole all of these bitcoins not want to spend them?  Or try to exchange them gradually at some point in the future?

Isn't that what has happened consistently and repeatedly with paper currencies?
I'd say a 'rollback' would set adoption back even longer.

I think because of the hacking language going around.  Mind you, there isn't any proof that there was some sort of hack, but that seems to be part of the narrative.
Never attribute to malice what could just be negligence?

So you're able to trade it easily.

Who's this from?

So does this effectively mitigate the Tor MITM attacks that have been reported of late?  Specifically, compromised Tor exit nodes have allegedly been used to steal passwords and access wallets.

LSD from a darknet market.
LSD is very difficult to find in the flesh so it's unsurprising that bitcoin and darknet markets have started to fill that particular niche.  Same goes for DMT, which is even rarer.
I took it and binge-watched music videos from my absolute favourite band Beirut.  I stayed up until sunrise and drank tea and smoked cigarettes.  It was lovely.

TSR doesn't exchange bitcoins.  All transactions are BTC only. It maintains an escrow service as well as individual account balances that can be withdrawn to a wallet address of your choosing at any time.  I'm sure they have some fees in there to keep the thing profitable, but this fellow's statement implies that TSR is exchanging bitcoin balances for cash on the regular...  which, of course, it is not.

It's almost as if you cherry-pick statements that support your argument!
I'll lay it out plainly for you:  I don't like you.  You don't know a terrible lot about what you're talking about.  You have also latched on to the term 'HFT assholes' for dear life and repeated it no less than 32 times in comments in the last week and that annoys me.  The acronym 'HFT' has appeared in your comments 85 times.
At some point you should probably consider moving on to a more pressing issue.

The total now stands at 34.

It is extremely difficult to weather a DDOS attack.  It takes a lot of equipment and a lot of money.
Your anger is well founded, but misplaced.  You should be angry at the folks that did the DDOS'ing.  Or you could be angry at the online exchange model that makes bitcoin vulnerable to such attacks in the first place.
Or you could be angry at yourself for investing in a bubble.

According to this:


It would appear HFT can't be done with version 2 of the MtGox HTTP API.  I was frankly surprised that MtGox has an API that supports the placing of orders at all.
At any rate, if I was responding to a DDoS, the first thing I would reach for is the switch that shuts off that API.
I don't think the blame can be laid at the hands of HFT assholes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:31:15


That, I think, is a sentiment everyone can agree with.
If there wasn't a coordinated attack on MtGox as I strongly suspect, IMO you still can't really fault them.  How could they anticipate that sort of traffic spike?  MtGox is doing something quite unprecedented (at least as the technology is concerned).  You can't make a direct comparison with something like the TSX and say, "See?  MtGox are amateurs!". 
Either way, now that the bar has been set higher, MtGox will very likely improve their infrastructure to meet the demand.  In addition, it looks like there's a strong will in the community to diversify exchanges.  The crash will likely be a good thing for the community.
I think what I'm responding to is what I perceive to be an atmosphere of delusion and scape-goating created by people that lost in this market.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:09
I find it very difficult to believe that MtGox (or any well-coded platform for trading) would not institute transaction time limits.
Do you have any evidence of the existence of these HFT assholes or their hardware?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:45
The fact is that Gox is the most resilient and well funded exchange in the community.
Other exchanges don't have the funding to weather a DDOS as well as Gox.  If anything, splitting trading between several smaller exchanges would make it easier, not more difficult, for a DDOS to adversely affect trading.
