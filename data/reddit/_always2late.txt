So then allow me to adress the Elephant in the room now... BCH. Can we please talk about BCH now?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:47:44
currently thats me, 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:00:29
I know for sure that Coinbase and Gemini disagree with you as they still understand that BCH and BCG could very well take over the market cap and has stated that whoever has the highest marketshare will carry the BTC ticker because of exactly what i stated earlier... This really isnt even a debatable topic, nobody of any merit who actually has anything to do with development, or has been a key member of the community long enough to see this whole discussion is under the impression that BCH/BCG/s2x is anything other than the most recent development of the discussion. 
The problem is really just reddit, and its harmful AF to bitcoin as a whole

too lazy to respond to your idiocy so heres a video. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:44:12
Technically he didnt claim support for BCH, he claimed that S2x is a clusterfuck, and he is totally against that, which pretty much means BUY BCH, because the BTC network may very possibly be down for an undetermined amount of time
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:07:50
You are an idiot, use your brain and think about this objectively. The fact that we're arguing about this is proof that this video is correct. Heres another one. Segwit 1x didnt deliver. Segwit 2x is a clusterfuck... look at the charts

The markets have pretty much already spoken, and whether you agree or not Roger Ver seems to be on the right side of things right now
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:42:47
Just google his name He's the first person to ever write about blockchain. Judging by your stance on this whole mess a quick look at the wikipedia page for him alone will blow your mind and reshape the entire way you think about blockchain tech.

I hate to say this here, but BCH is looking better and better by the minute
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:39:59
its also the most pofitable thing to mine by far right now
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:26:37
you're looking at it all wrong. Coinbase and Gemini already decided for us They are going to list whatever has to highest market share as BTC
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:28:32
So does this mean that we cal talk about BitcoinCash here now?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:52:03
Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin, that is what BTC Maximalist-shills have beaten into your skull because they don't want anything to hinder their profits. Until we actually solve the scaling problem BCH is just as much the real bitcoin as BTC. Currently Segwitt is not doing what it was proposed to do so that means increased blocksizes are the only option which was the reason for the BCH hardfork
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:04:55
I refuse to pay one red cent to the US govt for what I've made trading digital currencies/assets that they refuse to accept as legitimate. 
Also on a more libertarian note, not only is taxation in general theft, but taxing the most rapidly growing industry financially that is spawning technological innovation at an even more rapid pace across an unprecedented number of fields all at once, is the definition of shooting yourself in the foot

Why should the miners not have control, they are the backbone of the network, and when you really think about it they dont really get paid very well, compared to even some of the worst traders
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:53:15
My main reason for even bringing him up (other than the fact that this thread is about Satoshi) is becauseit seems that everyone is forgetting is that bitcoin really isn't meant to be anything more than a proof of concept. Just happens to be a very very successful and valuable proof of concept.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:47:18
miners are bitcoin. there are no fucking transactions without miners. please go take your bullshit somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:05:49
tbh you guys should really be looking at nick sabzos stuff. Will change the way you look at everything
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:34:22
The 2nd vid i linked does a really good job of just giving data no emoitions, no shills. its explained there(the reason i posted it)
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:45:03
Bitcoin Cash already has more miner support than bitcoin, already has retailers accepting it, Coinbase and Gemini already stated that they will consider whichever one has more market share the real bitcoin. Bitfinex is only on the side of 2x because they invested heavily in blockstream... What else most wallets support both, so yeah i dont see why anything stopping adoption at all.
You're looking at this all wrong though from the get go. First off whether r/bitcoin wants to admit it or not BCH is the real bitcoin, just as BCG is as well. What is happening now is all apart of what satoshi planned. This is decentralized free market governance happening in real time. Finally everyone seems to forget that Bitcoin itself is nothing more than a proof of concept for the blockchain, which was necessary to create smartcontracts. So in a sense bitcoin doesn't even matter now that the Ethereum network has flourished,  the only reason that it's stuck around this long is because it became a household name. (which really only happened because of silkroad) Bitcoin was the first, it had its run, and now its time to pass the torch on
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:49:49
Essentially the bitcoin name will go to whichever coin has the most market share Coinbase and Gemini have already set the standard for this.  As far as brand recognition, it really doesn't matter what the everyday person thinks about crypto anymore as its grown to the point where the banks have accepted it and are now trying to manipulate it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:54:12
No im tryng to open up real discussion rather than passing around BTC-Maximalist kool-aid
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:31:16
centrealized mining is only a temporary problem, with more countries opening their eyes, as well as improved technology and renewable energy we will soon see large scale mining ops showing up around the world. Until then increasing the block size is actually a better solution to scalability that has already proven itself to work. We also have Graphene on the horizon which is a million times better than segwit, that can be applied to either network. 
It really comes down to this. Segwitt 1x didnt workout the way it was planned to, Segwitt2x is a clusterfuck, so now we really only have 1 option left and thats to go with increased blocksizes, aka BCH

roses smell like something aweful
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:41:29
have you ever even looked at coinwarz? Do you even know why its been the most profitable coin recently? Do you know anything about the tech advancements behind BCH that allow it to have a constantly adjusting difficulty, as well as blockchain size? Regardless of how this turns out, I suggest you educate yourself because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about

this sub is already a cespool of filth. Just wait till Ethereum switches over to POS and the real fight for bitcoin begins.
