Thanks for the link.. It seems like there is a lot of information available!
Bcash? I've never heard that.. everywhere I've read calls it Bitcoin Cash or BCH although some exchanges I've looked at call it BCC which is a bit weird.
Why do you think Bitcoin will continue to increase in value? I've seen some sites that say that Bitcoins value will decrease because of Bitcoin Cash because it can process transactions quicker and has less fees.. Is there any truth to this?

What's FUD?
2nd layer technologies? I'll google this and see what you mean

Okay, I see what you mean.. The Lightning Network.
Send BTC to Lightning Network (pays on-chain fee)
Complete transactions on Lightning Network (Little to no fee) 
Send BTC from Lightning Network back to chain (pay on-chain fee)
That actually makes sense.. My immediate thought is do you think this will reduce the on-chain transactions which will in-turn reduce the on-chain fees?

Firstly thanks for your links.. I'm going to check them out right now.
The average transfer fee seems quite high on Bitcoin and at one point went to $16 per transaction.. This doesn't make sense why does the fee change? I looked at Bitcoin Cash and they are paying only cents for their transactions.. I don't understand this.
I read online something about bigger blocks result in smaller fees why can't Bitcoin have bigger blocks?

I guess that make sense, I've read about the blockchain and it seems like a really interesting piece of technology.. even large corporations are looking to use blockchain for other purposes.
I don't know 50GB a year doesn't really sound like much? I've got a 500GB hard drive which means I could hold 10 years of data.. Why is space a big issue?
I understand the concept of store of value but I always thought the limited quantity of bitcoin is what helped it increase in price.. forgive me for asking but I don't understand where the value comes from if people aren't using it because of high fees.. What are these implementations? Is there anywhere I can read about these?
