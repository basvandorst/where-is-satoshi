Absolutely brilliant website and service, but the UI should be a selectable theme: old, new, dark, high contrast. Perhaps like 4chans bottom right selecter.

-You would buy btc from some exchange... and have them send that to your wallet. (in this case your online wallet- so your receiving address)
-If you wanted to purchase some flowers etc from a site like the SR, you send an appropriate amount of coins to your SR wallet (your account on sr generates a new bitcoin wallet address)
-add sr item to cart, enter sr accounts wallet pin. provide receiving address.
-Funds go into escrow and you wait to receive the flowers in the mail. Once done, give feedback on sr and allow the funds to be cleared to the seller.
The hardest part really is getting your fiat -&gt; btc. But that bottle neck is easing.
protip: Don't send btc straight from your mtgox etc account to the SR address. 
btc can be anonymous, providing you use it in an appropriate fashion.
Good luck friend! Welcome to the revolution.

Huge fan of the colored coin idea. You've said before you going to be aiming to work on your own exchange if I remember correctly yes? Obviously just a website front end for a distributed stock exchange ( Which certainly has become evidently needed after the glbse closure)
I agree that keeping colored coins on the bitcoin blockchain is a better  idea than overlaying them on the namecoin network, as the bitcoin network is much much more secure in regards to the amount of hashing power required to undertake a 51% attack that I imagine would be substantially less for a less widley used fork.
Good luck Killerstorm, you've spotted a vital next step in the advancement of fair economic systems and are giving it your all. On behalf of the Bitcoin community I'd like to congratulate you.  &lt;3

This is what I think the idea of colored coins would be ideal for.
You could color a single bitcoin to create 100,000,000 MMOXCoins. This allows for the game creator to have a set (or ability to influence through inflation) units of ingame currency. 
That would give these coins an independant value to bitcoins. eg. I wanna buy lvl  over 9000 sword ..I can't just load my btc in..I'd have to buy the games colored btc with my plain coins ..If nobody is willing to sell their colored coins, I can't just introduce a huge amount of money into the game throwing things outta wack. You might even be able to short these coins as they change value due to supply and demand. (Trust issue may arrise with game owners ability to inflate by creating more of the same colored coins (with the priv key) though)

Why not start your own bitmit account with the items you're selling on ebay aswell...?
Along with cheaper fees, you'll have a little more peace of mind with no bullshit paypal chargebacks

Interesting to see where this goes if governments keep defining it differently. - China calling btc a commodity like gold, swed calling it a currency. I'd be more inclined to call it a commodity myself. It's not a representation of money or anything, it's just a well organised protocol for some rare hash values. Coincidentally, those hash values are easily moved, divided and traded with the Bitcoin protocol. But the 'valuable' part is just as much a real thing that can be found as 1kg of gold or the 237th number that starts with 3, or the 1000th prime number. What makes it appear as a currency is the protocol we use to make it act as one.  Calling it a currency subjects it to too many AML laws and regulations when really it's not entirely applicable to Bitcoin.

Mitigating the problem before it becomes realized would be a better choice than letting it happen and hoping the double spends weren't too serious and the users of the pool leave promptly after the see what they're apart of.

except a bank could demonstrate their holdings much easier aswell as it be easily verifiable.

but you're forgetting the fact that these 'bubble scares' are becoming more and more common. To the point where most of the bitcoin(understanding) community has become jaded with all this 'omg this time it's a real bubble' talk. 
It's stabilizing to a degree. As in, panic sells and panic buys are becoming less of an issue affecting peoples choices and in turn the market. We can see a $300 drop without that spurring a wave of sells to to floor. We've seen a track record of this many times. The only thing happening now is people getting burned trying to predict the highs and lows of these fluctuations.
There have been many 'cleansing' occurrences, where those that where holding based on pure speculation have jumped ship (of course some re-bought, at lower prices or did some panic buys as it rose more) ... Point is, the money is now more likely becoming more concentrated in the more steady hands - those looking long term and not trying to short every opportunity they can.
I disagree with your calculations of a drop to the &lt;$500 range. The trends you speak of wont continue so rigidly. They're taken into account too, but that changes the whole dynamics of the market. Nobody(wise) bets directly on the market, they're betting 1..n steps ahead depending on how sure their predictions are. Which ultimately affects everyone else and the accuracy of their future predictions.
I'm quite disappointed by your FUD spreading, backed with such trivially sourced guess work.  NotSureIf.jpg trying to lower price to buy more or actually holding such hollow beliefs.

Roundabout way to fix.
* .00001xxxx btc stuck in account
* send .105 to above account
* withdraw .100001 (leaving .005 for tx fee)
* final account balance: 0 btc

Ha, yea. I've had a keen interest in it for a while longer than my postings started appearing... First verbalizing in bitcointalk forums..due to the resistance and lack making any headway with friends and what not. Trying to share a good idea that in truth does have some radical elements quickly get's dismissed and labeled crazy babble unfortunately. Anyway, hopefully my comment wasn't taken to heart, I just had the free time and took issue with the evaluation and felt it irresponsible to leave that analysis without at least a contrasting one. Nice work on that profit though, I was unfortunately not in a position with much investment capital but what I do have in it now is certainly a lifestyle changing amount. Best wishes to your future brother.

This is exactly right. Anything can be a world currency...t's just a matter of everyone coming to the same voluntary conclusion that x is best suited to their needs. OF course bitcoins fill the voids of manyyyyy people but if there are groups of people who still wish to use fiat, gold, shells, rocks etc let them.. 
What OP is missing here, is that there is no such thing as a defined world currency,nor should there be. Let the market be the decider of what is worth what..It does it best and most dynamically. This doesn't mean people will just suddenly all become aware of whats a good choice of money, feel free to (infact I encourage it) to inform others of what is useful why you use what you do and hopfully are versed in it enough to back up your beliefs in the presence of any criticisms or concerns

Solution: TrueCrypt your wallet file, With a hidden volume. 1 file, 2 volumes, each with a different password (the hidden vols existence is unknowable from looking at the TC file). Someone is bashing you with a wrench for the password? Give them the password..to the volume containing the insignificant info.

My prediction is BTC will be the worlds 'gold reserve' that is used as the backing for each governments created crypto. So they can still regulate it n all that horrible shit. That or coloredCoins with each country having their own colored supply that's gov issued to buy for dem taxes. As much as I would like it to obliterate their influence over money I think at least initially, btc will only be able to drastically reduce that power...While they've still got the sheeple on their side and the military power...that scarily is moving into robotics and autonomous war machines that aren't as difficult to issue orders to kill/arrest etc. innocent civilians as perhaps a human military force would be. We're really letting it get dangerously deep... Unmanned, 100% obedient war machines are a perfect army. You can't reason with a machine. All you can do is turn it on and off again, then hope for the best. At what point did this post diverge into a prattling ramble is the real question here though.

I'm more taken by the 'skip all this shit' approach and move straight to satoshis. At this growth rate, we'll be hitting another need to change the terms for ease of understanding..Most people are familiar with the k or kk ( MMO gamers)
1k satoshi 
69kk satosh
suggestions for a satoshi symbol? 'BS' 'sBTC' 'BTCS' are all probs too vague. 
OR! WHAT ABOUT AN 'S' WITH A LINE THROUGH IT!!! ..$...Perfect.
