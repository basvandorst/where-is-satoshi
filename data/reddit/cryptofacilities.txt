So far, UK regulators seem not to have looked at bitcoin as much as US regulators. And most UK banks stay away from it. Would not call it hostile though, they have very strict regulations and just do not want to take any risk.

I think at the moment institutional capital is mostly going to companies developing the infrastracture around bitcoin as opposed to into the currency directly. Hard to say if this is going to change soon...

We are working on that. It is less straight-forward from a regulatory point of view.

That you have to ask regulators. The CFTC seems to classify it as a commodity, which is very broad.

We are looking at that yes, but don't expect it extremely soon.

That is correct, so in the event that the collateral of your counterparty is insufficient to cover their loss AND they do not post additional collateral what happens is:
- Their position is liquidated on our market so that you will have a new (solvent) counterparty. You would not even notice that OR
- If for whatever reason their position cannot be liquidated, it will be terminated but at price that is 5% in your favor compared to the current spot price (so higher if you are long, lower if you are short). This compensates you for the gap risk you have between the time this termination happens and until you have replaced the trade (if you so wish)
A member cannot just make a small deposit and put on as risky a positions as he/she wants. The initial margin is 0.5 BTC for 1 long Forward and 0.25 BTC for 1 short forward. This provides initial price move protection of 33% in either direction to their counterparty. They need to post at least that much margin. And if their position moves against them, they would first have a chance to top up margin (when maintenance margin is hit). If that does not happen or the price moves further, the position would be closed out automatically and if that is not possible either, it would be terminated. In each case, a notification is sent out.
Hope that helps.

We address that issue by storing all bitcoins on offline servers. These private keys are never connected to the internet. So the scenario you mention would not be possible.
Having said that, it still requires the trust of our clients that we do this right and we are working on a solution to remove that trust requirement.

Thanks for the feedback. We have focused on developing a secure, reliable product which you might agree with when reading the documentation. Design did not prevent some of the things we have seen on exchanges so far. Having said that, we are actually going to re-launch the design soon.

This means we match buyer and seller, collect and administrate margin and payments but do not act as cental counterparty in these trades.

Not right now, we may add options at a later stage though.

- If you have 1 bitcoin as collateral, you can buy 2 forwards, giving you an exposure of 3 bitcoins or you can sell 4 forwards, giving you an exposure of -3 bitcoins. The reason why it is not symmetric is that bitcoin serves as collateral and becomes more valueable when the price increases and vice versa.
- What do you mean by profit/loss ratio and how did you get to the 73.3%? One way to think about it is Initial Margin initially covers your counterparty against a 33.3% move in either direction. If only 5% of this move protection remains, the position would be terminated. For that the price would have to move by around 28% in the wrong direction AND no additional margin was posted AND the position was not liquidated before (which normally would happen by closing it on the market)
- Any bitcoin you have in the account is counted as collateral. Depending on your positions and how the market moves, you could lose what is in your account. If you wanted to limit your loss to Initial Margin exactly, you would have to pay in only as much as you need to just cover IM
Hope that helps.

Not nearly!

Yes, it is bitcoin only at the moment. We are working on adding fiat.
