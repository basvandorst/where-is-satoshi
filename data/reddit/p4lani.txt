Thank you Pieter for your response and all your contribution in Bitcoin! I have been reading recently about Casa keymaster and did not know about Blockstream Green wallet. I will check it out.
What would happen if I enter my mnnemonic phrase from a Ledger Nano wallet in the Blockstream Green mobile App? 
Could someone in the future secure funds with Casa and Blockstream to reduce risk?

Ocean Ramsey and Juan from Oahu. They recently got a lot of attention for swimming with a huge great white shark in Oahu. You can dive with shark without any cage with them all year long, I highly recommend it! One of the most amazing experience I've had in my life!

Not yet. Using Bitcoin Ticker at the moment, but I will be happy to make the switch when I can

Thank you for sharing! Lot of good info! 
Perhaps something worth adding to your guide would be how to use a Shamir's secret sharing scheme to secure private seeds and share shards with friends/family safely to protect and distribute one's wealth.

He is salty and wrong about Binance. CZ success is not only about Sep 4th.
