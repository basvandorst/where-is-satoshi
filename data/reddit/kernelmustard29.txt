The key word is "store" in that statement.  We obviously have to use some type of Exchange to buy and sell bitcoin, but leaving it there for any longer than necessary is a grave risk.  The same goes for fiat currency, as the Bitfinex users found out the hard way.

I disagree.  For buying bitcoin, simply transfer the bitcoin from the Exchange to your personal wallet the moment it arrives.  For selling bitcoin, simply transfer the bitcoin to your Exchange account immediately before selling.  Storing bitcoin on any Exchange is very dangerous.  And please try to use bitcoin to pay for goods or services whenever possible instead of selling it.  Bitcoin usage is good for the ecosystem.

I agree that more regulation would not be beneficial to the Bitcoin project as originally conceived by Satoshi.  As Ronald Reagan said, "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'"
I'm just amazed that Satoshi didn't work this out ahead of time.  Clearly, he's a genius and a visionary.  Missing the key exchange of fiat to BTC during this period of early adoption is a tremendous oversight.
Something has to be done about the current state of the BTC exchanges, and I think the answer is recruiting the existing fringe financial networks as BTC exchanges.  Traditional banks and credit unions probably won't play ball, but it's possible the Western Unions, Amscots, and convenience stores would welcome the extra income.  Let those large companies that already have money transfer licenses in the US and abroad buy BTC wholesale from mining pools and large retailers and sell it to the masses.

No, it's laziness and tolerance of criminal activity to simply accept a loss and move on.  This isn't a bad trade in the stock market where you cut your losses and move on, this is burglary.  
If someone broke into your house and stole 30% of your stuff, would you just shrug your shoulders and be thankful they didn't steal 100% of your stuff?  You'd probably call the police and demand an investigation.
There is still a lot to be gained from going after Bitfinex.  First, it would force them to cease operations, which I see as a very good thing because they are clearly incompetent to protect customer assets.  Second, it would force liquidation of any operating capital, assets, or other investments that might be on the books.  Third, it would open up the books to third party auditors and allow the public to learn the truth about what really happened. Edit: Fourth, it would provide justice for those who were wronged.  Fifth, it is the socially responsible thing to do.
Bitfinex are either crooks or incompetents, they should absolutely never be trusted to steward the public's assets.

Exporting private keys and using paper wallets is not at all necessary.  Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets are very secure and simple to use for the novice bitcoiner.  Easier than setting up a multisig Coinbase Vault, and apparently much more reliable.  All people need to do is document their seed words and store them in safe places, which would also be necessary for any of the online vaults.  I still don't see any advantage to storing bitcoin at Coinbase.

There is nothing left to redistribute?  Have you seen Bitfinex's books?  Nobody else has.  Bitfinex is still one of the largest BTC exchanges, I'm sure there are both fiat and BTC deposited in trust accounts right now that could be liquidated.  There could be operating capital set aside that could be liquidated.  There could be investments of any type that could be liquidated.  
But most of all, a judge could force Bitfinex to open the books to auditors during a liquidation and close their doors for good.  
If the Bitfinex "hack" was an inside job, people go to prison.  If it truly was negligence, then reputations and careers are ruined.  If it was a magnificent heist that couldn't be prevented, they will be exonerated.  Inquiring minds want to know.

No, SegWit separates the transaction data from the witness data and stores it separately.  Only the transaction data goes into the original 1 mb block, the witness signatures are appended to a new section that doesn't count against the 1 mb limit.
Here is a good example of how SegWit increases the block size.  Say you're building a workshop in your backyard and you're getting the bricks and lumber at a warehouse store.  At first, you only have a 1 ton pickup truck, so both the bricks and lumber have to go into the pickup truck bed.  Your pickup truck bed gets full and there's a huge backlog of material that needs to be transported, so you buy a trailer that adds 3 tons of capacity behind your pickup truck.  Now you can load just the bricks in the pickup truck bed and load the lumber in the trailer to get up to 4 ton capacity (in theory.)  Since the trailer has some quirky limitations, the max in theory is actually 3.7 tons, but most loads are going to max out at around 2.7 tons due to the characteristics of the materials.

When it was $8k previously, you said it would crash to $1,000-2,000 because of adoption. It didn’t even get back to $8,000 so you weren’t even close, and now it’s back over $11k, and adoption still had nothing to do with it. The flash crash was due to the first set of futures contracts expiring with the institutional investors on the short side influencing the price drop so they would win the contracts.

The Lightning Network is one of the Layer 2 solutions.  It's essentially a cache of Bitcoins that a person commits to a payment channel transaction on the main chain with another person or payment hub.  
Bitcoin payments can be sent back and forth to anyone else on the Lightning Network (very much like the way the Internet works) over the payment channel thousands of times, instantly, with little or no fees.  The payment channel can be closed (settled) by either party at any time, but channels are expected to be used many thousands of times before being settled.  
When the miner fees for the channel opening and closing transactions are amortized across the thousands of instant transactions, the fees per transaction are negligible.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:05:04
That's not true.  You can open and fund thousands of separate Lightning Network channels with a single on-chain transaction, similar to the way Exchanges batch withdrawals.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:00:58
You can settle the channel whenever you want, but each channel should be good for thousands of transactions.  Spreading those $10 on-chain transactions over thousands of payments makes them super cheap on a per transaction basis.

On-chain coffee transactions were feasible when fees were super cheap early on due to the very generous block rewards.  We've already seen that small, casual transactions just don't make sense on-chain for at least a year.  That's why the community has been pushing for Layer 2 solutions for a long time.  Coffee transactions belong at Layer 2, or possibly higher, rather than on-chain at Layer 1.

A billionaire can't realistically buy every bitcoin, even a modest attempt to own 25% of the supply would likely drive the price out of reach.  Thinking in terms of whole bitcoins is so 2015, most people will never own a whole bitcoin.  
To give it a frame of reference, if a whole bitcoin is valued at $1M USD, then one satoshi would be equal to one US cent.  In that case, goods and services priced in US Dollars would probably be priced in microbitcoin (μBTC), colloquially referred to as bits, which is 0.000001 or 10^(-6) bitcoin.  Something priced as $549.99 USD (pronounced 549 dollars and 99 cents) would cost 0.00054999 bitcoin or 549.99 μBTC (pronounced 549 bits and 99 sats.)

Absolutely, Hal Finney's RPoW is the genius secret sauce.

Combining RPoW with difficulty adjustment to keep the value of each token approximately correlated to the cost to mine it is what makes the magic happen.

I disagree.  People don't buy silver or copper because they can't afford a whole pound of gold, they just buy ounces (or fractions of an ounce) of gold.  Litecoin isn't really the corollary to silver either, it's mostly just a clone of bitcoin with some parameters changed to make it a little different.  Bitcoin is in the process of gobbling up the altcoin market share, it's very likely that all but a few altcoins will be practically worthless within the next wave of progress.

Yes, there is third party escrow capability built into LN.


There will definitely be a market niche to provide third party escrow services on LN.

This is where Visa, MC, AMEX, etc could evolve and be relevant in the future.  But then again, Sears and JC Penney were perfectly positioned to be the go-to online retailers, but they failed to evolve and lost out to Amazon, Overstock, and other major online presences.

Ok, I get your point, and I agree with you. However has a point in that all of the IRS guidance documents paint virtual currencies with a single broad stroke. 
They say getting paid in virtual currency is taxable income, paying someone else with virtual currency is taxable for the payee, and purchasing anything with virtual currency creates tax liability for the spread between the purchase price and fair market value at the time the virtual currency is spent.  
There is nothing in the IRS guidelines that differentiates between variants of virtual currency, so an argument could be made that exchanging BTC for ETH is the same as exchanging 24 karat gold for 18 karat gold. 
Am I missing some specific language in another IRS document?
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:13:54
The previous commenter’s position is that virtual currency is a single asset class comprised of every type of virtual currency; therefore, trading BTC for ETH is the same as changing a $10 bill for ten $1 bills.  I’m not sure I agree, but it is an interesting angle.
Exchanging virtual currency for other property is considered cashing out the virtual currency investment for the fair market value of the other property, so capital gains tax would be due on the spread between the purchase price and sale price of the virtual currency.

Lightning Network is basically an Internet of nodes riding on top of the Bitcoin network.  All anyone needs is one channel to a hub and they can send payments to anyone else, anywhere on the Lightning Network, just like anyone can get to any website with one connection to an ISP (unless the connection is filtered.)  It's very feasible to use the LN for 1,000 (or many more) transactions.
The original comment assumes that every Lightning Network channel will be used at least 1,000 times and eventually settled to the Bitcoin blockchain with one transaction; therefore, BCash would need 1000x larger blocks than Bitcoin with LN to service the same amount of transactions.  133MB x 1000 = 133TB.  However, each LN Channel actually requires 2 transactions, one to open the channel and another one to close it, so BCash would actually only need 66.5TB blocks.

Exactly right. Bitcoin has grown up and evolved past the days where coffee and beer transactions should be on-chain.  All of the fundamentals and core beliefs of Bitcoin are still valid, Lightning Network (or other Layer 2 or 3 networks) will simply bump those minor transactions up a layer or two to make room for more valuable transactions that will garner higher fees in order to pay the miners to secure the network.  
The free ride of 1 cent beer transactions would never scale to even PayPal levels, especially when the block rewards dwindle and eventually expire, because miners won't process 1 cent transactions when they rely primarily or solely on tx fees to pay the bills.

LN uses a routing protocol to route payments, similar to the way the internet uses BGP.

My point is that Bitcoin on-chain transactions are no longer appropriate for microtransactions and casual spends like coffees.  SegWit enables Layer 2 and 3 solutions, that are currently under development, which will take those types of spends off-chain with instant and nearly free transactions.  All of the original cypherpunk philosophies are still applicable, Bitcoin is just pushing them up to another layer.
I understand the nostalgia of early adopters and how they can feel like Bitcoin has abandoned what made it great in the first place because of higher on-chain transaction fees.  However, the initial design proved that it just couldn't scale effectively in a linear fashion with block size increases without significant centralization pressure, which many feel is a much more important attribute than the ability to process minor transactions.  
Another factor is that increased fees for on-chain transactions is a very good thing for miners and it is starting to condition the user base for having to pay higher fees as the block reward halves every 4 years.  Satoshi himself envisioned that on-chain transaction fees would be enough to compensate miners once the block reward expires.  At that point, on-chain microtransactions and coffees would be priced out no matter the blocksize.
Complaining about confirmation times and fees for coffee purchases isn't going to change Bitcoin's course because it has evolved and is continuing to move on to bigger and loftier goals.  In my opinion, it would be a better use of time to lobby exchanges, payment processors, and other high volume users to adopt SegWit transactions in order to relieve fee pressure and reduce confirmation times while the next layer solutions are implemented.

Coffees are not the types of transactions that should be stored in a highly secure blockchain for all time. Those are casual transactions that nobody cares to document once the payment clears and the coffee is consumed.  
Major purchases, such as property, vehicles, watercraft, investments, major appliances, and other things where publicly verifiable proof of ownership would be beneficial are the type of transactions that warrant permanent storage in a highly secure blockchain.
That doesn't mean there aren't valid use cases for buying coffees with cryptocurrencies; however, the market is still sorting out the best way to meet that demand.  Offchain solutions like Lightning Network may be the answer.  Atomic swaps to altcoins may be the answer.  Continuing to use Visa/MC/AMEX may be the answer.  There may even be another brand new concept down the line.  We'll just have to wait and see how the market responds.

The wealth is stored on the blockchain.  The private keys that allow the transfer of wealth are stored by the owner in a hardware, software, or paper wallet.  The wealth cannot be stolen without the owner surrendering control of the private keys.  
The bitcoins "stolen" from exchanges are simply instances of bad operational security by the exchange operators, which is why users should never store bitcoins on any exchange.  Without control of the private keys, users don't own their bitcoins, they only have an IOU for bitcoins.
The wealth is not compared only to fiat dollars, the wealth is compared to anything else of value.  Most things of value are denominated in fiat currency units for now, so I understand how people get confused, but bitcoin can be directly exchanged for a wide variety of goods and services right now.
As far as the Trezor recovery is concerned, users can throw away their Trezor and recover their bitcoins using their seed words with any BIP32/39/44 compatible hardware or software wallet.

The OP letter appears to be addressed to Germany, so the bank account would have been insured up to €100,000 - and 19 bitcoins would have been worth about €6,500 at the time - well within the limit.
Whether or not it's possible to pay out €100,000 to everyone isn't even a little bit realistic.  
(Of course, the ECB could absolutely print as many Euros as they need to cover the deposits, but that would likely cause hyperinflation and ruin the currency prematurely.)  
A car insurance company couldn't afford to pay the max benefit to every policy holder and a health insurance company couldn't afford to pay for medical services up to the lifetime maximum for every policy holder either.  Insurance, in general, is a concept to socialize low-probability yet high-risk scenarios across large groups of policy holders, not as a safety net for every policy holder at the same time.
Deposit insurance exists to cover up to the maximum amount for a very small slice of banks that actually do fail.  Most depositors don't have anywhere near the maximum amount and most banks are healthy, so the realistic exposure is nowhere near the maximum theoretical exposure of €100,000 per person.

You're having to go way out of context to try to salvage your argument.  Systemic bank failure is not what happened with MtGox, it was one exchange failing.
You stated that if the OP's money was in a failed bank, it would be gone forever.  This is simply not true, the OP was well within insurance limits for EU deposits and would have received his or her money very quickly.  
Deposit insurance is really insurance, there are private corporations in most countries that bear the risk, but I will concede that the taxpayers as a whole are ultimately responsible for paying the claims if they exceed the assets of the private corporation.

I disagree that having fees greater than the block reward is insane; in fact, it's exactly what's going to be needed in the future when the block rewards are phased out.  Somebody has to pay the miners to secure the network.  
Bitcoin was never meant to have free or even cheap transactions, that was never one of its core values.  Satoshi himself envisioned that transaction fees would support the miners when the block reward dwindled and eventually expired.  The early adopters got spoiled because the block reward was 50 BTC, difficulty was low, and the mempool was empty so miners happily processed every transaction just for the block reward.
Another point is that transaction fees must remain high in order for users to adopt the Lightning Network.  LN has been active on Litecoin for a long time already and it's a ghost town because there is no fee pressure to convince users to use it.

The value proposition is the ability to store wealth on a decentralized, distributed, publicly available blockchain that is verified by about 8,500 independent nodes and secured by 12 trillion GH/s of processing power.  This wealth can be transferred across borders within minutes for very reasonable fees.  This wealth is stored in a deflationary asset that is not subject to the whims of any world government.  It's quite possibly the safest, most useful, and highest appreciating asset of all time.

The mining marketplace is extremely efficient at balancing hash rate with block rewards + fees.  At the last halvening, the hash rate was about 1.5 exabytes.  The current hash rate is about 15.5 exabytes.  The amount of hardware and electricity required to mine is incredible.
Many experts expected the fees to be equal to the block reward about halfway through the 12.5 BTC reward cycle, so it's only slightly ahead of expectations.

Metcalfe's law states the effect of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2).  
To get from 30-50M users to 1B users, the user base would double about 5 times; therefore, the value of the network should also double about 5 times, which would be about $200K USD per bitcoin.  That's 32x today's price of about $6500 per bitcoin.

According to my CPA, exchanging 24 karat gold for 18 karat gold is not taxable.  Exchanging gold for silver is taxable because they are different assets. 
As far as the text you quoted, it depends on how “exchange” is defined. I don’t see “exchanged for another virtual currency” so it’s reasonable to define it as “exchanged for goods or services” which is clearly taxable. 
There’s a lot of gray area that will be sorted out over the next few years.

Maybe you missed the activation of SegWit, which enabled sidechains like Lightning Network, atomic swaps with other cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts.  Side chains and smart contracts are serious threats to many other popular altcoins.
I believe there is no coincidence that Bitcoin’s price caught fire as the emergence of SegWit became clear with the UASF, as SegWit actually activated, and then when the NYA/S2X hostile takeover failed.  
Bitcoin has continued to prove itself to be anti-fragile through a wide variety of attack vectors. Every time the Money Badger takes another victim, it becomes more valuable. 
Bitcoin as an electronic cash system was worth a couple hundred dollars a coin. Bitcoin as a store of value and a foundation for side chains and smart contracts is worth tens of thousands dollars per coin, maybe even more.

The max blocksize was already increased from 1 MB to 1.7 MB with SegWit activation back in July.  Many of the exchanges and other high transaction volume users still have not implemented SegWit and they are not doing batch transactions. (I'm talking about you, Coinbase.)
A hasty move to go with 2 MB blocks would only increase capacity by 0.3 MB and it would require a hard fork with universal node and wallet upgrades.  That's insanely risky for such a small gain, and there's no indication that exchanges or other high transaction volume users would be willing to upgrade.
The best course of action at this point is to lobby exchanges and other high transaction volume users to implement SegWit and use batch transactions in order to reduce transaction volume and fee pressure until Lightning Network arrives.

LN uses 2-of-3 party multi-sig, so the escrow company literally can't scam anyone by themselves because they never take custodial ownership of the funds.  One could argue there is less trust involved with a 2-of-3 party transaction than a 1-to-1 party transaction.  The only trust required is that the escrow service is a fair mediator in the case of a dispute, which requires less trust than a 1-to-1 transaction that has zero recourse if the seller defrauds the buyer.

That is not a true statement, the amount of coins in circulation (supply) does not dwindle at halvenings, the inflation rate is simply cut in half according to a well known schedule.
Halvenings undoubtedly have some limited affect on value because the miners essentially take a large pay cut; however, there are many other ways that the mining market can get to equilibrium through some combination of bitcoin value, transaction fees, and hash rate.  Transaction fees will likely increase and unprofitable mining gear will likely get decommissioned as the block rewards decrease.

As you point out, there were plenty of wars when the world ran on gold; however, that was when the victor was able to take the spoils by force. 
A group of people that were faced with losing a war couldn’t destroy their gold, they could only try to move it or hide it. Once everyone was killed, captured, or surrendered, there was nobody left to stop them from confiscating it. With Bitcoin, a group of people faced with losing a war could simply destroy their private keys to prevent the victor from seizing their bitcoins. 
In any case, wars haven’t been fought over gold for quite some time. They’re mostly fought over territory disputes, natural resources, politics, and religion.  The first two can be mitigated by efficient trade markets, the second two are the bane of humanity’s existence.

There's no reason the coins have to be stacked on one address, so that's not a real argument against custodial services.
Most people are not technically savvy enough to store their own private keys safely and have a viable plan for transferring their coins to their designated heirs upon their death or incapacitation.  Many people are going to be willing to pay a fee to custodial service to manage their accounts for them.  Opening up the crypto markets to the masses is going to be the fuel for the next stage of the moon shot.
Just because there are custodial services does not mean that those of us who are technically savvy enough to manage our own private keys must use these services.  The peer-to-peer and self-empowerment described in the Bitcoin whitepaper is still valid and available to anyone with the ability and will to manage their own keys.
The bottom line is that custodial services and ETFs are a win-win situation.  They won't take away our ability to be our own bank and they will bring in an immense amount of new participants.

I'd argue the launch of the Lightning Network is the equivalent to the dawn of the WWW because it puts a real interconnected application layer on top of the transport layer.
In any case, Bitcoin and LN adoption and development may take longer than the Internet adoption and development for the simple reason that the current electronic money system of ACH deposits, wire transfers, and credit/debit cards is very well established and it's pretty convenient for the first world population for most transactions.  There are some ugly spots like some deposits taking several business days to clear and transferring large sums across borders, but most first world people rarely go inside a bank branch anymore.  They get their paycheck via ACH, pay bills electronically, and charge most daily purchases on credit or debit cards.  The Lightning Network experience will probably be very similar.  People will receive paychecks via LN and pay bills electronically and spend daily expenses from that same channel.  It's not a game changer for the first world, but it will revolutionize the third world and developing nations that don't have modern ubiquitous banking services.
The advent of the Internet solved a lot of real problems for the first world with much cleaner user experiences.  Email, IM, online shopping, digital media, voice over IP, online publishing, social media, and even online banking improved efficiency and increased the quality of life for a segment of people with money to spend on these services.  However, the third world and populations with authoritarian governments were largely left out of the revolution.
Bitcoin is a godsend for the third world and the unbanked, so that population is going to benefit the most quickly.  The first world will lag behind a bit, but it won't be long before first world corporations realize they can use the Bitcoin network to reach new markets and the first world won't want to be left behind.

I agree that borrowing against them is not a taxable event, unless something happens that forces the sale of the crypto. I don't know of any lenders that allow borrowing against crypto holdings yet, but I'm sure there will be value limits similar to the way margin works in an investment account.  For example, if the crypto value falls below a certain level, the lender liquidates the crypto to cover the loan.  Obviously, a foreclosure would also trigger liquidation.  In both of those scenarios, your crypto would be gone and you'd get a hefty tax bill from your friends at the IRS for dessert.
I understand the urge to diversify, I'm feeling it myself.  I think the best way right now is to sell some of your crypto for fiat, then purchase other assets.  Long term capital gains tax for 2017 is only 15-20% depending on your marginal tax rate, so if you've held your crypto for over a year you can liquidate it fairly inexpensively from a tax perspective.  
I agree that rental properties are a tried and true way to build long-term wealth, so use the fiat from your crypto sale to buy a couple of them outright.  After a couple of years of rental history, you can borrow fiat against the rental properties to expand your empire.

Do you really think Stalin and the Soviets would have preserved our government?  Do you think the Islamic extremists wouldn't impose Sharia Law on us?  Americans have paid the ultimate price in all of these conflicts, both domestic and abroad, to defend our country and our right to vote.  To say otherwise is disingenuous.
Whether or not our founding fathers would be deeply ashamed of this election is a matter of opinion.  One could argue that the American people chose these candidates through the primary system and are getting the exact choices they deserve.  The founding fathers were more about protecting the process than imposing their own politics, so I think they would be fine with the outcome.
There are more than two candidates to choose from in this Presidential election.  Gary Johnson represents the Libertarian Party in all 50 states and every other state has at least one more candidate on the ballot.

How would any government "regulate" crypto to stop this?  The only way I can see is to demand that everyone include a government-controlled multisig address in every transaction, requiring government approval before the transaction posts.  There's nothing stopping anyone from thumbing their nose at that demand in Bitcoin.  I suppose it's possible to require it in a future soft fork, but at that point, it's definitely not Satoshi's vision of a decentralized, censorship-resistant electronic peer-to-peer cash system and Bitcoin would be dead.

Is a $1M USD per bitcoin valuation really that crazy where it requires eroded trust in fiat to the point of blood in the streets or serious panic?  The $1M USD per bitcoin valuation would equate to a $21T USD market cap, not accounting for lost bitcoins or bitcoins that haven't been mined yet. For the purposes of this thought exercise, we'll use the full $21M bitcoin supply.
As a comparison, the Gold Market alone is about $8T USD.  If the Bitcoin Market were to match that $8T USD, each of the 21M bitcoin would be worth about $380K USD.  Is it that outrageous to believe that humans would value the Bitcoin Market at 3x multiple of the Gold Market?
Now let's take a look at the Global Bond Market, which currently exceeds a $100T USD valuation.  Is it really that outrageous to believe that humans would value the Bitcoin Market at 1/5th of the Global Bond Market?
Bitcoin is uniquely qualified to challenge the Gold Market and the Bond Market because those are the two go-to markets for storing value.  All it would take for a $1M USD per bitcoin valuation is 50% of the Gold Market ($4T USD) and 17% of the Global Bond Market ($17T USD) without even considering any encroachment on other commodities or stores of value.  And what happens if world governments start using Bitcoin as the preferred reserve currency?
As many others have said, it was more impressive for Bitcoin to go from $0 value to $10K than it would be to go from $10K to $1M.
But please don't take this as investment advice because Bitcoin is still very experimental.  All it would take is the discovery of a serious bug in the software to erode the general public's faith in the project.  Don't invest anything more than you can afford to lose.  If you have some serious gains, don't be afraid to lock in some profit.

I agree with this part.  We don't need a massive political revolution or war or economic collapse for Bitcoin to take over the world.  A steady march forward is all that's required.  
Technological revolutions tend to be bloodless, quiet, and (relatively) gradual.  Email didn't kill the post office overnight, it just gradually forced it to downsize and morph into a package delivery service.  Uber didn't kill the taxicab business on day one, it is just gradually taking over and forcing the taxicab industry to modernize and be competitive.  Streaming didn't kill the CD right away, it forced the music industry to restructure their entire financial model gradually.  Amazon didn't kill the catalog companies (Sears, JC Penney, etc) in one fell swoop, it gradually choked them out because they didn't adapt.
It's very likely that Bitcoin will gradually become the world's reserve currency and the preferred store of value at the same time it gradually gains acceptance with merchants.  At some point, the remaining fiat will be an annoyance like the Zimbabwe Dollar and nobody will want it for anything other than collectible keepsakes.

Absolutely, the government would love to eliminate cash.  Over the past 20 years, the use of actual cash money has dropped dramatically.  Many people use some form of electronic payment for almost all of their monthly transactions.
The government loves it, because they can strong-arm banks and other institutions into giving them whatever info they want and even freeze balances whenever they want.
Bitcoin is a much different story.  The government literally can't track every transaction with 100% accuracy and can't seize the Bitcoins without obtaining the private keys.  That's the context.

Having two hardware wallets with the same 24 word seed doesn't provide any additional security because the private keys would be identical.  Ideally, you'd want two hardware wallets from different manufacturers with different seeds.
With that said, you could accomplish all 3 use cases using a single hardware wallet with 3 different passphrases representing 3 different private keys.

Security Experts around the world agree that SMS is not a secure method of 2FA.  SMS is not and was never intended to be secure, the messages have always been in plain text.  SMS 2FA was intended to be a step in the right direction, and as other commenters have stated, it is better than just a password.
The TOTP protocol that Google Authenticator uses was designed for 2FA, and it's still not completely secure.  It's vulnerable to the secret key being revealed by a person or a flaw in the implementation, but it's still very secure.
Just because you haven't been hacked yet (that you know of) doesn't mean that you're not hackable.  That's a ridiculous assertion.

Satoshi implemented the 1 mb cap as a method to discourage DOS attacks and transaction spam.






Making it possible for many users to run a node during the adoption phase is extremely valuable to the Bitcoin network's decentralization and censorship resistance.  The unexpected advent of mining pools and ASIC mining rigs changed the game, running a full economic node is now an extremely valuable contribution to the network.






BTC hardly leads with anonymity.  The most valuable properties are decentralization, censorship resistance, immutability, and scarcity.  Anonymity is a component of censorship resistance, so it is an important piece of the puzzle.






Again, the advent of mining pools and ASICs created the need to keep block sizes low to maintain the ability for many users to run full economic nodes.  Decentralization is more important than micropayments, which can be facilitated with layer 2 solutions without compromising decentralization.  Satoshi also envisioned using nLockTime transactions for high frequency trades between a set of parties, which is essentially the Lightning Network.  [

There is a pretty easy software engineering solution to defeat net neutrality throttling.

I agree that SMS as 2FA is better than just a password; however, the specific example given here is securing GMail or a crypto wallet with SMS as 2FA.  GMail definitely supports TOTP and any wallet worth using would also support TOTP.
TOTP are not perfect, they are susceptible to disclosure of the unique key for each website, but they are orders of magnitude more secure than SMS.  U2F keys are the most secure option at the moment, but they are also vulnerable to implementation bugs at any specific website.  And all security measures are vulnerable to the $5 wrench attack.

Completely agree.  Is this how it would work?  
Rather than have a checking account with a bank, where employers send direct deposits and employees pay their monthly bills, employers can open a LN channel with each employee.  Employers could pay employees on the LN channel, and employees can use the same channel to pay their monthly bills. Employers could refill the channel each payday so the channel could stay open for the tenure of employment. 
If that is the case, then I can see a couple of areas of concern.  First, the employer could always see the balance of the LN channel, and that's a privacy concern for the employee.  Second, it's likely that employment will shift from a dedicated model to the on-demand model in the future, so many employees will be free-lancers and work for several employers, and managing multiple LN channels would be an unnecessary hassle.  I suppose both of these concerns could be resolved by employees opening a completely separate LN channel and funneling their pay there as it comes in, or a smart wallet of some kind that aggregates channels for the user.
What are your thoughts?

[Edit to add this commentary]  I agree that human psychology matches better with an inflationary currency than with static or deflationary currencies.  Not only is it very easy to understand for the common person, but it's a psychological flaw that allows the banksters and governments of the world to steal the global increases in efficiency every year (2-3%) while raising prices another nominal 2-3% per year.  It also allows us to commit to fixed-payment loan repayments confidently.  
Switching from an inflationary currency to a deflationary currency will be a paradigm shift that most people will struggle to understand.  If the US, for example, can't switch to the Metric system because the legacy English measurement system is so entrenched, then how could the US switch from inflationary to deflationary currency?  
For these reasons, I think prices for goods and services will be priced in USD for the foreseeable future.  Bitcoin will be used as a store of value and as a currency; however, each transaction amount will be calculated at the current BTC/USD exchange rate.  I'm not saying all transactions will actually be converted from BTC to USD; the funds will stay in BTC, but simply be traded at the current value of USD for the goods or services.  Eventually, after several generations of people live this way every day, the USD could be phased out completely.

There may be a million ways to impede Bitcoin, but there will always be another way to keep it working.  Collusion of every ISP in the world isn't a very likely scenario.
In any case, repealing Net Neutrality isn't about stopping Bitcoin, it's about charging high-bandwidth content providers (like Netflix) more to access the downstream networks (like Netflix subscribers), which makes sense.  Could it be used nefariously, absolutely, but it's extremely unlikely.

Sure it does, the thing that changes is the rate at which the doublings happen.  It’s called the S curve.  In technology, the rate slows as the adoption rate approaches market saturation.  
Bitcoin is nowhere near saturating the market, so there should be plenty more doublings in the future as the adoption rate grows.

The CME Futures piece is interesting. When I first realized the contracts would be cash-settled, meaning no BTC ever changes hands, I wondered if the futures might be as irrelevant to the price of BTC as the influence of wagers placed on sporting events affecting the outcome of the games.  I expected some effect, but not a commanding influence.
Now I realize that the CME futures traders are also allowed to be traders in the BTC markets, so it's more similar to sports players being allowed to bet on the outcome of their own sporting events.  Point shaving, back door covers, and other super shady strategies are definitely possible.  When they are possible on Wall Street, somebody will take advantage.  There is a reason that sports players aren't allowed to bet on their own games, this would decimate the integrity of the games.

Again with the horrible grammar; you're clearly not qualified to question anyone else's intelligence.  
You should also take a history of economics class so that you properly understand that buying power and currency value are not directly related.  Buying power with inflationary currencies (like USD) will steadily decline over time, while buying power with deflationary currencies (like Bitcoin) will steadily increase over time.  
I will refer to the Zimbabwe Dollar (ZWD) as an extreme example.  In 1980, the ZWD traded on par (1:1) with the USD.  By 2006, the ZWD inflated to a 1:500,000 value compared to the USD. By 2009, the ZWD inflated to 1:300,000,000,000,000 (300 Trillion) and their money is sold on eBay as a novelty.  
While that kind of hyperinflation is very unlikely to happen to the USD, it's certainly possible that some hyperinflation will occur and $26M USD per BTC is not out of the question.  The US National Debt is over $20T and growing by the second.  The only way to pay that off is with some limited hyperinflation of the USD.
The USD has lost 95% of it's buying power since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.

Since there are a fixed number of Bitcoins that will ever be minted and they are minted at a fixed rate that halves (about) every 4 years compared with demand that is growing exponentially, how will "the market ~~to~~ will reach demand" and lower prices by 75-87.5% exactly?  
Market prices are governed by the nexus of supply and demand. Bitcoin has a fixed supply and demand for Bitcoins is just getting started.  Prices are going to continue to increase until Bitcoins are more expensive than anyone is willing to pay.

I suppose each of us is entitled to their own personal definition of what The Moon means to them.  Many humans have a hard time conceptualizing the power of exponential growth, so something worth $1 originally appreciating to $10,000 appears to be an impressive feat; however, that is only between 13-14 doublings.  It is impressive, but judging Bitcoin solely by price is not a thorough analysis.  
If we define The Moon as mass worldwide adoption, where most people use Bitcoin as a store of value and/or as a currency, it's easy to see that there is still room for exponential growth on that front.  Price and adoption go hand in hand.  Exponential adoption should help drive exponential price increases and vice versa.
At the current price of about $6,500 USD per BTC, the price has doubled between 12-13 times since hitting the $1 mark.  The price only has to double 4 more times for each BTC to be worth over $100,000 USD.  If the price doubles 8 more times, each BTC will be worth over $1.6M USD.  If we're fortunate enough to get another 12 doublings, each BTC will be worth over $26M USD.
All of this sounds crazy, but when you factor in the scarcity of Bitcoin and calculate the exponential price growth, it's entirely possible for Bitcoins to be worth $25M USD each by the time mass adoption happens.

I agree that we have differing opinions on what will happen.  I have trust in the free market system, especially as it relates to technology, keeping ISPs in line.  We'll have to wait and see how it plays out.  If the evil corporations abuse the system, all it takes is the stroke of a pen for Net Neutrality to be restored.


History shows us that the free market holds corporations accountable, even where there are limited choices for consumers.  I'll use the cell phone industry as an example.  There are only a handful of nationwide providers in the US, right?  They used to all offer unlimited cellular data use because they had to remain competitive.  Then after smartphones became data hogs, they all gradually migrated to fixed caps on cellular data.  Then one of the smaller providers removed those cellular data caps and saw an influx of customers, which caused the other companies to follow suit.  The cell phone providers aren't in collusion, they're just adjusting to what the free market will bear.  There are countless other examples of the free market working without government regulation.  Even OPEC can't control worldwide oil outputs with 100% certainty, how would a group of unaffiliated ISPs in the US manage to cripple Bitcoin with 100% certainty?

Bitcoin has been dropping 75-87.5% in value repeatedly since launch?  I think your charts are broken.  There was ONE instance, when the Mt. Gox trading bot created artificial demand in late 2013, where the price dropped that far when that artificial demand vanished.  There were a couple of minor dips when "China Banned Bitcoin" and removed a huge chunk of demand or when exchanges were (allegedly) hacked and undermined consumer confidence which reduced demand.
The consistent theme to every dip is that demand was reduced by some directly related event.  According to transaction volume charts, Adoption has never capped, so it has clearly never been a factor.  Based on your inability to provide any reason why demand would suddenly vanish at Mt. Gox collapse levels, it's safe to conclude that there is no reason.
Since history and adoption caps have been ruled out, that leaves "common sense" as your argument for why Bitcoin will drop 75-87.5%.  I'll trust the Law of Supply and Demand over your "common sense" any day of the week.

You're completely wrong.  The ME is enabled by default and it's nearly impossible to disable for a normal user.
We know minix is very insecure, so it's Intel's duty to prove that they have addressed all known vulnerabilities and they have taken steps to remove any unnecessary attack vectors.  That's why the author suggests using open source Linux for the ME and AMT functions.
A minix rootkit could take control of a computer's OS without an owner's knowledge and remain undetectable to antivirus and antimalware applications.  With control of the OS, it would be next to impossible for an owner to detect an outbound leak.  Someone could absolutely be spying on you and you'd never know it.

You claim to be using an isolated pre-paid burner for all of your SMS 2FA - which is more expensive, more inconvenient, and orders of magnitude less secure than running the Google Authenticator app on your primary phone - and I'm the one being stubborn and talking nonsense?  
An attacker would not have to guess your burner number.  Assuming you use the same burner for all of your 2FA for economic and practicality reasons, here are some real-world examples of how your 2FA burner number could be identified:
1) There is a very good chance that your 2FA burner number has already been compromised in one of the many data breaches and is published somewhere.  This is not a problem with TOTP like Google Authenticator because it uses a separate key for each website.
2) Even if your burner number hasn't been compromised yet, the attacker could use social engineering, bribery, or any other underhanded tactic to get some organization to reveal your 2FA burner number.  This is not a problem with TOTP like Google Authenticator because it uses a separate key for each website.
3) If the attacker knows where you live or work, they can breach the SS7 network and monitor the cell towers closest to your home or work.  Since GMail exposes the last 4 digits of your number to anyone requesting a password reset, it would be trivial to match up your burner number to the numbers registered with a handful of towers.  This is not a problem with TOTP like Google Authenticator because the separate keys are never revealed over an insecure channel.
None of these SMS 2FA scenarios are science fiction, they are all currently in use by cyber criminals, and they would absolutely be deployed to steal any sufficiently valuable stash of digital bearer instruments.

It's a slippery slope.  I am a US Citizen.  We are allowed to buy or sell bitcoin through an exchange that complies with KYC/AML laws in pretty much any amount.  
We are allowed to spend them however we want, although it looks like we're supposed to calculate the value change between purchase price and spend price for capital gains or loss reporting purposes.  
We're allowed to buy or sell bitcoin with ordinary individuals in small amounts, which is intentionally left vague so the government can prosecute at their own discretion.  
Businesses are allowed to accept bitcoin as payment, but they also have to track the value from when they were received to when they were converted to fiat or spent for capital gain or loss reporting.
So far, doing business in bitcoin is pretty much the antithesis of what Satoshi envisioned.  It's a tangled web of laws and regulations that is almost impossible to navigate cleanly.

You're on the right track, but you have it backwards.  TCP is a network protocol that enabled the Internet, which in turn enabled the MySpace's and Facebooks to be developed.  Bitcoin serves a similar purpose, it is a network protocol that created the Internet of money.  Payment networks, like [Lightning Network]( and other Layer 2 applications, like [Digital Identity]( are being built on top of the Bitcoin network.
The advantage to building Layer 2 networks and applications rooted in Bitcoin versus creating yet another altcoin is that Bitcoin is the ONLY truly decentralized blockchain and it has unrivaled security.  Any new Layer 2 network or application rooted in Bitcoin immediately inherits Bitcoin's decentralization and security, there's no need to reinvent the network.
The innovation that will drive mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is happening and will continue happen as Layer 2 (and higher) networks and applications rooted in Bitcoin.  Layer 2 (and higher) is where networks and applications are at risk of the MySpace vs Facebook and Yahoo vs Google flippenings.
A better analogy for the altcoins is back when AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy, and private Bulletin Board Services were competing with the Internet at the network layer and they got demolished.  Some remnants of those companies survived, but only as content providers, their network infrastructures have been long gone.

VisaNet processes 150M tx per day, which amounts to about 1700 tps on average with a 24,000 tps theoretical maximum.  
There are *currently* almost 2,000 LN nodes on Bitcoin Mainnet, in the project's infancy.  Each LN node is certainly capable of at least 1 tps, which means it could currently handle Visa's throughput right now with room to spare.  Each LN node can easily handle 12 tps, so LN can match VisaNet's theoretical maximum performance right now. We're talking about real world performance on a deployed network, not vaporware.
Each LN node can process hundreds of tps, so LN is already an order of magnitude better than Visa, and it hasn't even started to take off yet.  VisaNet is a dead man walking.

If we're comparing the Bitcoin protocol to Internet protocols, it's most comparable to the layer-3+4 transport+session protocol suite TCP/IP.  There were other competing suites, such as IPX/SPX, DECnet, XNS, and even Appletalk, that claimed to solve the perceived problems with TCP/IP, and they are comparable to altcoins.
What happened with the Internet ran out of TCP/IP version 4 addresses?  Did the network become useless and did everyone switch to IPX/SPX?  No, TCP/IP version 4 implemented NAT (which is essentially sidechains) before expanding the address space with TCP/IP version 6.  That's exactly what the Bitcoin community is doing now.
Lightning Network is comparable to Layer 7 application protocols like SMTP, NNTP, Gopher, Finger, Telnet, FTP, SSH, HTTP, etc.  While some of those protocols have become obsolete, many of them have been improved upon and are essential to the way the Internet works.

When credit card networks become obsolete due to the adoption of Lightning Network, merchants won't be hostage to cc processors and won't have to pay processing fees that get passed on to consumers.  
The fees for transacting on LN will be infinitesimal, sub-Satoshi, so even if 1 BTC is worth $1M USD, transactions will cost less than a cent.  Fees will be too cheap to worry about, for both you and the merchant, so prices should go down for everyone.
Another incentive for merchants to adopt LN is that they will get full custody of their money immediately, rather than waiting 2-5 business days for the cc processor to ACH money to their business bank account.
LN is a win-win for both consumers and merchants.  It's only a matter of time before LN disrupts the credit card industry the way Amazon disrupted Sears &amp; Roebuck's catalog mail-order industry.

I think Zeeterm is trying to point out that LN transactions are off-chain.  Only the opening and closing transactions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, there can be countless off-chain transactions back and forth while the channel is open, and none of them are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.
I disagree that off-chain transactions defeat the purpose of a global distributed trusted ledger.  Many transactions are unimportant to track for any duration longer than the transaction.  For example, does anyone really need their coffee transactions stored on an immutable blockchain for all time?  The only transactions that really need to be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain are those between two or more parties that don't trust each other.

Cash, as well as Bitcoin (or any other asset that is stored in a multi-tenant, full-custody environment) is subject to fractional reserve.  
Even if you keep all of your cash in your own private environment, other people can (and will) store their cash in multi-tenant, full-custody environments, so your cash will suffer from fractional reserve practices.

Blockchain without a token of value is insecure and not trustless.  Proof of Work (PoW) is what makes blockchains useful.

When you buy something over the Internet with USD, you're most likely paying with a credit or debit card.  In any case, the use of credit or debit cards is most definitely not free.  
The credit card processing companies charge fees, generally between 1% and 4% of the transaction amount, to the merchant.  Most credit card processors forbid the merchant from passing those fees to the customer so the prices for products and services appears to be the same for cash or credit payment methods.  However, the credit card processing fees get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for every product to everyone.
Bitcoin, in it's current form, is not anywhere near a finished product.  The best comparison is that it's a pre-AOL and pre-WWW internet experience.  When the applications, like Lightning Network, are fully developed and widely adopted, spending bitcoins on the internet will be an amazingly simple process.

Oh, I definitely agree, Bitcoin should always remain a PoW system.  Things may actually shake out where Bitcoin is the world's only real PoW system, and all the specific applications are Layer 2 or higher PoS solutions anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain; possibly even most of the altcoins.
If you think about it, apps like Lightning Network are already PoS systems anchored in Bitcoin's PoW chain.

Perhaps adding the BCH fork was easier than implementing SegWit; however, batching transactions has made perfect sense since Day One.  
It's inexcusable that Coinbase (and your ShapeShift, among others) took so long to batch transactions, especially when the mempool was full and tx fees were skyrocketing.  The fact that some of the biggest proponents for a blocksize increase were the very same people responsible for the tx backlog and the high fees is very fishy indeed.

Exactly. US Dollars are created with debt (national, commercial, and personal.)  If all US Dollar debt was paid off, the US Dollar would simply cease to exist.
The US Government can borrow and spend as many US Dollars as it wants because it simply orders the Federal Reserve to create them out of thin air. The borrowing limits are arbitrarily set by Congress, and they extend the limits regularly, there is no theoretical limit to how many US Dollars that can be created.
The only realistic limit on the US Dollar supply is the ability of the US Government to find another entity to borrow it or buy the various bonds or bills.  As long as the world continues to view the US Dollar as one of the safest currency investments, there will be plenty of buyers.  If that faith is shaken for any reason, all bets are off and the US Dollar could crash just like any other fiat currency.
Fiat currencies have relatively short life spans and the US Dollar supply has been dramatically (horrifyingly?) expanded since the turn of the millennium.  Inflation is coming at some point, which will spur investors to flee the US Dollar and could possibly cause the US Dollar to crash.

There is no evidence that nobody is using Bitcoin anymore. In fact, the larger blocks due to SegWit adoption and transaction batching by large payers provide evidence that the network is being used more efficiently.
Lightning Network transactions ARE Bitcoin transactions, made with real Bitcoins.  The LN simply takes some transactions off-chain that don't require the overhead of being recorded and secured on the blockchain for all time.  All of the principles Bitcoin was founded on still apply to LN, it's still a decentralized system of efficient and trustless peer-to-peer financial transactions that will eliminate the need for banks for those who embrace it.
I don't deny that at some point there *might* need to be an increase beyond the 4000 kb block weight that SegWit introduced; however, it's entirely possible that another backwards compatible soft fork or alternative solutions like sidechains could provide further effective block size increases.  The community can rest assured that every possible solution that maintains consensus will be thoroughly explored before any hard forks.
Some of the more forward-thinkers in the Bitcoin community believe that network congestion and higher fees is actually a good thing for the Bitcoin network.  It will drive trivial transactions up to Layer 2 and compensate the miners appropriately as the block reward dwindles and eventually expires.
How does Bitcoin Cash intend to compensate miners appropriately as the block reward drops to 6.25 and 3.125 over the next 6 years?

It really depends on how any individual uses credit cards, which are largely a First World luxury anyway.  The responsible way to use credit cards is to charge purchases to your account and then pay it off at the end of the month; however, I'm well aware that a large portion of credit card account holders use them to finance large purchases.  This behavior is the driving force behind the greatest redistribution of wealth in history, as consumers pay outrageous interest rates for purchases.  (As my grandfather used to say, "Don't spend money you don't have on stuff you don't need to impress people you don't know.")   /endrant
In any case, I understand your question to be more about how to build a credit history without traditional credit cards.  Take a step back and realize what role the credit card processing company fills.  The only value they provide is that they provide liquidity for consumers, merchants, and banks in exchange for a fee for facilitating the transactions.  The LN would allow you to cut out the credit card processor and deal directly with the lender, whether it be a bank or an individual investor.  That credit account would be reported to the credit bureaus and help you establish a good credit history.
The second part of your question is how to finance major purchases, like cars and houses, by borrowing bitcoins.  When bitcoin is ready, it's price will be very stable. When appreciation is stable, there will be speculators and investors who will be willing to loan their bitcoins out for major purchases in return for interest payments.

Why do you think credit card processors are blocking bitcoin purchases with credit cards?  They're terrified of the LN making them obsolete, just like the WWW made AOL obsolete, Amazon made Sears catalog obsolete, and Netflix made Blockbuster obsolete.  In the near future, people will open credit lines with banks and/or investors directly over LN.  
This will happen because companies like yours, that do hundreds of millions a year through the card networks, are run by smart people who are going to be able to reduce those transaction fees to almost nothing and pass the savings to the bottom line and/or lower consumer prices to win more sales.  Business owners and shareholders will demand it.
Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, etc. need to come up with some other value proposition, because being a middleman in the digital age is a death sentence.  One free suggestion for them would be to start LN nodes now and build out their cross connections as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately for Bitcoin Cash, free market principles are detrimental to the security and decentralization of that network.  If the fees are cheap as the block rewards decline, the total compensation for finding a block will decline.  The mining ecosystem is very efficient in establishing hash rate to protect the network.  Miners shouldn't, and won't, spend the capital for equipment and pay electricity bills for equipment that isn't profitable.  Therefore, as the compensation declines, the hash rate will decline, and the mining will become even further centralized in places with low cost electricity.  As hash rate declines, the network becomes less secure.  As centralization occurs, trust becomes a requirement, and being trustless is the most important tenet of Bitcoin.

The reason people would invest their bitcoins is to earn higher returns than the Global Deflationary Rate and to provide liquidity to the economy.  It's up to the investment companies to pay adequate interest rates to attract investors.
Depositors should be asking why banks are only paying a fraction of a percent in interest on savings, because they are lending money out at a minimum of 30% interest when they have 10x fractional reserve leverage on 3% interest rate loans as described above.

I agree that the current easy-credit-for-everyone system is toxic; however, the ability to borrow money to get an education, start a business, or buy a home allows many people to climb out of poverty.  It's all about borrowing wisely to make an investment in your future, rather than buy consumer junk on credit.
For example, a friend of mine in high school was brilliant but came from a very poor family.  He borrowed money to go to college, then dental school, then endodontic school.  Then he borrowed money to open his own practice and then purchase a beautiful home.  His income as an endodontist has allowed him to pay off all of these loans and build a handsome nest egg at age 45.   Imagine if he had to work a low wage job to save money for education, opening his own practice, and purchasing a fine home.  It would probably have taken him to age 45 or 50 just to get through school and get his practice open.
If the credit system is completely gone, it will would provide a massive advantage to the rich, because they will be able to afford to get their life started without spending time building up the resources to get an education and/or start a business.

8x transactions at pennies apiece will never compensate miners at the level required to secure the network anywhere near the current levels.    And by the time there is enough competition for those 8 mb blocks to raise fees, the Bitcoin Cash community will likely simply expand blocks further.  
The inconvenient truth is that Bitcoin Cash's business model is not sustainable without artificial inflation.  The only viable solution is for the Bitcoin Cash community to expand the 21M coin limit to provide continuous inflation to keep the miners happy.
There will be a LOT of transactions on Bitcoin, most of them will be on Layer 2 or above and miners will be compensated to secure the network through on-chain transaction fees at the level that the market forces decide is fair.

As stated above, it's a hard fork, which should only be done with community consensus after extensive testing.  
Much of the community thinks it's not necessary to increase block size until the effects of broad SegWit adoption are determined, so there is not consensus in the community.  
The code has yet to be released, so it hasn't been widely tested; in fact, if any development has been done at all, it's been done in private, because the git repositories have not been updated.

In a hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin has taken over as the defacto world currency and price has stabilized, we can expect 2-3% annual deflation based on worldwide productivity increases.  There could be further deflation if bitcoins were truly lost and even more deflation if the world's population continues to grow.  Let's call this the Global Deflationary Rate, it doesn't need to be pegged to a number.
Once the price is stabilized and every hodler is pegged to the same Global Deflationary Rate on privately hedl bitcoins, some people are going to get antsy and try to increase their returns by investing their bitcoins in various ways.  As more people do this, others will join in to keep up with the Joneses.  Soon, it will be normal to have bitcoin hodlings invested for growth.
As part of these investment strategies, people will probably lend their bitcoins to others in various ways in order to earn better returns.  Since most people are fully occupied with full time jobs, there should be an industry of professional investors that organize deposits and administer the loans.  
If most people invest most of their savings with these professionals, then those organizations will have the ability to implement a form of fractional reserve banking to leverage their deposits for higher returns.  Fractional Reserve Banking vastly inflates the money supply; for example, a 10% Fractional Reserve policy would allow an organization to lend 1,000 bitcoins on a 100 bitcoin reserve deposit.
– You deposit 100 BTC. Your bank loans someone else 90 BTC.
– That person deposits 90 BTC. Their bank loans someone else 81 BTC.
– That person deposits 81 BTC. Their bank loans someone else 72 BTC.
– That person deposits 72 BTC. Their bank loans someone else 65.61 BTC.
– That person deposits 65.61 BTC. Their bank loans someone else	59.049 BTC.
– That person deposits 59.049 BTC. Their bank loans someone else 53.144 BTC.
– That person deposits 53.144 BTC. Their bank loans someone else 47.829 BTC.
– And so on			
Ultimately, your initial 100 BTC can grow into 1,000 BTC with a 10 percent reserve requirement.
It could turn out almost exactly like today's banks or investment firms, but without a central bank as a lender of last resort to quell any bank runs.

As far as Capital Gains Tax, at least in the USA, you get to choose which "lot" of Bitcoins you are using for a transaction.  They don't have to be used on a first-in-first-out basis.  
If you buy Bitcoins immediately before you spend them, you can designate the new lot as the lot being used for the transaction.  There is no Capital Gain, therefore no tax due.  
However, you would still bear the burden of documenting every time you bought new Bitcoins and used them to buy something immediately as proof in case you were ever audited by the IRS.
The point about losing fees to Exchanges remains.  Add in the burdens of the buyer paying transaction fees on Bitcoin purchases and the lack of most consumer protections.  That's why using Bitcoin for real world purchases is less attractive than using credit cards.  Buyers will have to go against their own best interests to promote the ecosystem if they want to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions.  
Hopefully, second layer solutions will level the playing field or even make Bitcoin better than current credit cards.

I would refer them to the link above about Consensus in Computer Science.
SegWit maintains consensus by optionally extending block weight to 4000 kb in a backwards-compatible format for those who choose to use it.  Lightning Network is also an optional Layer 2 solution that is completely backwards-compatible.
Again, SegWit and Lightning Network do not break consensus rules and don't affect anyone who chooses to use the legacy transaction types.
Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, is a hard fork that changes the consensus rules and is not backwards-compatible with the Bitcoin Network.  It is, by very definition, an altcoin.  Promoting it as anything other than a fork of Bitcoin is extremely unethical.  Playing off the Bitcoin brand and trying to confuse newcomers is nothing short of disgusting.
EDIT: I forgot to address the allegation of changing Bitcoin's original concept.  Lightning Network transactions ARE Bitcoin transactions, made with real Bitcoins. The LN simply takes some transactions off-chain that don't require the overhead of being recorded and secured on the blockchain for all time. All of the principles Bitcoin was founded on still apply to LN, it's still a decentralized system of efficient and trustless peer-to-peer financial transactions that will eliminate the need for banks for those who embrace it.

I think we need MORE people that are willing to sell bitcoin in person.  The problem is that many people are criminals, and there is a huge risk of getting robbed or killed before, during, or after any substantial cash transaction.
I've been trying to solve the puzzle myself.  It seems the key is providing safety for both parties.  My best idea so far is to do the transaction in person at a Western Union.
1) The buyer goes to a Western Union and transfers money to himself/herself.
2) The buyer and seller meet in person at a Western Union.  The buyer receives their cash at the window and exchanges it for bitcoin in person.
3) When the transaction confirms, the seller sends himself/herself the money.
4) The seller goes to Western Union later to pickup the money in the form of a money order.
5) The seller deposits the money order in a checking account.

There is always an opportunity cost when a person chooses to spend vs. save a currency.  In the case of inflationary currencies, like the USD, people are incentivized to spend their currency before it loses value to inflation.  With established deflationary currencies like Gold, people are incentivized to save their currency to hold their spending power steady until they need it.  With new deflationary currencies like Bitcoin that are still in the very early adoption phases, people are incentivized to hodl their currency in order to benefit from massive appreciation during the adoption curve.
The bottom line is that looking back on old purchase transactions in Bitcoin is always going to look ugly because of it's deflationary nature and they're going to look ridiculous during the early adoption phase; however, spending them and getting good value in return at that point in time is a good deal for both parties.  Especially if the spender is wise enough to spend-and-replace.

I see your point, and I've thought about it long and hard as well.  It would be crazy to borrow bitcoins during the adoption curve, where the value of bitcoins vs not only fiat, but everything else, grows at a very high rate.
In the best case scenario for bitcoin, it will be the defacto currency for the world, and all goods and services will be priced in bitcoin.  The value of bitcoin will be deflationary, but it will deflate at a point or two a year.  People will be paid the same amount every year instead of getting raises, justified by their increased productivity offsetting the deflation.  Hodling bitcoins won't be a very lucrative venture because the value will be practically pegged to the consumer price index.  That means the only way to get ahead with savings will be to make investments and loan bitcoins to other people.  Once a few people figure out how to make an extra point or two by investing or loaning their bitcoins, everyone else will jump on board to keep up.
I think there's going to be a very long period of bitcoin and fiat co-existing, where the bitcoin side is used for storing value and the fiat side is used for growth and investment.

While this is true, changing out the crypto algo in Bitcoin would be very complicated.  The Bitcoin ledger uses addresses that are derived by [hashing the ECDSA private key 9 times]( so changing out the crypto algo while maintaining backwards compatibility (just in case Satoshi comes back and wants to spend his bitcoins) is not as easy as changing out the crypto algo in a military or commercial encryption system that don't depend on backwards compatibility.

Coinbase also doesn't run a Lightning Node, so your question was equally as loaded.
A better competition would be to take two identical battery-powered IoT devices, load the LN client on one and the IOTA client on the other, then have the two IoT devices process 1,000 microtransactions per minute until the IoT devices deplete the batteries to see which one is more suited for the IoT marketplace.

I never said I was anti-government or anti-taxation. I was simply mocking the notion that the government believes it is entitled to a share of individual income and capital gains to fund its voracious appetite for spending. 
The income tax and the short term capital gains taxes are designed to place the tax burden on the middle class, while relieving the wealthy elite from paying their fair share.  There are much simpler and fairer modes of taxation, such as consumption based taxes and property/asset based taxes, but the wealthy and powerful will never allow that to happen.

Direct LN connections will not have fees and they don't require committing processing resources for PoW functions.  Once an LN channel is open, users can refill it via other channels and never have to close it.  LN channels can be opened in batches of thousands with one single Bitcoin on-chain transaction, which is currently just a few satoshi.
IOTA requires processing resources for PoW for EVERY SINGLE TX, which will add up quickly when a device processes thousands of micro-transactions per minute.  Imagine a battery powered Arduino device as a typical IoT endpoint.  The processor is going to be cooking to try to keep up with the PoW, which will deplete the battery very quickly and render the device useless.  
Not to mention that it may not even possible to attach thousands of TX to the Tangle, nobody has been able to do it yet.
The bottom line is that LN is much better suited for IoT devices by any standard.

This article leaves out the fact that Bitcoin addresses are naturally quantum resistant because the public keys are hashed several times to create the addresses, and the hashing function is not endangered by quantum computing yet.  
While an attacker could theoretically use a quantum computer to derive your private key from your public key, your public keys are not revealed until your bitcoins are spent.  As long as addresses are not reused, the only time your bitcoins would be vulnerable is the brief window between the time your transaction is broadcast to the network (revealing your public key) and the time it is confirmed by a miner.  This is one of the reasons why modern wallets issue change to brand-new bitcoin addresses with new keys.
A successful quantum computer attacker would have to run a Bitcoin node and cherry-pick the transaction(s) they want to attack.  Then it would be a race to derive the private key from the public key and broadcast a new replacement transaction before the initial transaction was confirmed by a miner.  Then they would depend on the miner choosing to include their transaction instead of the initial transaction, which would simply require offering a higher transaction fee in most cases.
In summary, the attack vector against Bitcoin's encryption is much narrower than most people realize.  Addresses that have not been previously used in spending transactions, such as Satoshi's stash, burned bitcoins, and unintentionally lost bitcoins, are not vulnerable to quantum computer attacks.  The much bigger concern is breaking military and commercial encryption that doesn't hash public keys.

LN only has fees when a routing node charges them.  A person could open thousands of LN channels with one Bitcoin TX and never pay any routing fees.

The beauty of Bitcoin is not the blockchain or even the crypto. It’s the decentralization, consensus rules, and fixed supply. 
Blockchain is worthless without a valuable token as a reward for securing the network.  Many of the “next-gen” blockchains, like tracking chickens from the egg to the market, would be better suited for a traditional SQL database. 
Government issued and controlled cryptocurrencies are just digital currencies, like the electronic money in your traditional bank account. They’re nothing new and they’re certainly not transformative. 
The fixed supply of bitcoins is the main reason why they are valuable. Scarcity drives demand and demand correlates to higher value.  Many of the altcoins that have no cap (or a ridiculous cap) are going to leave their fans holding the bag as cryptocurrencies go mainstream. 
The reason Bitcoin is valuable is because it is transformative. It’s scarce, it’s secure, it’s decentralized, it’s peer to peer, it’s trustless, and it’s ruled by consensus.

Even the IRS does not claim the income tax is voluntary:
I. FRIVOLOUS TAX ARGUMENTS IN GENERAL
A. The Voluntary Nature of the Federal Income Tax System
1. Contention: The filing of a tax return is voluntary.
Some taxpayers assert that they are not required to file federal tax returns because the filing of a tax return is voluntary. Proponents of this contention point to the fact that the IRS tells taxpayers in the Form 1040 instruction book that the tax system is voluntary. Additionally, these taxpayers frequently quote Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 176 (1960), for the proposition that "[o]ur system of taxation is based upon voluntary assessment and payment, not upon distraint."
The Law: The word “voluntary,” as used in Flora and in IRS publications, refers to our system of allowing taxpayers initially to determine the correct amount of tax and complete the appropriate returns, rather than have the government determine tax for them from the outset. The requirement to file an income tax return is not voluntary and is clearly set forth in sections 6011(a), 6012(a), et seq., and 6072(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. See also Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-1(a).
Any taxpayer who has received more than a statutorily determined amount of gross income in a given tax year is obligated to file a return for that tax year. Failure to file a tax return could subject the non-compliant individual to civil and/or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. In United States v. Tedder, 787 F.2d 540, 542 (10th Cir. 1986), the court stated that, “although Treasury regulations establish voluntary compliance as the general method of income tax collection, Congress gave the Secretary of the Treasury the power to enforce the income tax laws through involuntary collection . . . . The IRS’ efforts to obtain compliance with the tax laws are entirely proper.” The IRS warned taxpayers of the consequences of making this frivolous argument in Rev. Rul. 2007-20, 2007-1 C.B. 863 and in Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609.

This is exactly why Satoshi's ability to stay anonymous is so surprising.  Sure, he was a cypherpunk, so we can expect him to cover his digital tracks with VPNs, TOR, and other anonymity tools; however, his ability to make all of his writings so vanilla, not just the whitepaper, but seemingly off-the-cuff forum posts is where we should all be even more impressed.
The FBI used linguistics to identify Ted Kaczynski as the prime Unabomber suspect way back in 1996 when they had very limited knowledge of the science and one small team of agents using it.  That success led to a huge push in developing software and human expertise to analyze linguistics for both law enforcement and intelligence agencies.  
It's shocking that the FBI or another 3-letter hasn't identified and outed Satoshi.  Unless they have identified him and made a strategic decision not to out him.  Or if they're a party to the creation of Bitcoin.  Sp00ky stuff.

@_date: 2018-04-08 17:15:53
I understand your point, and you may be absolutely correct.  The part that's blurry for me is whether or not it matters to the exchange where the payment originated or ended.  
As far as the exchange is concerned, they received a payment from Alice on one smart contract and then made a payment to Bob on a separate smart contract.  Since they have KYC/AML with both Alice and Bob, it's possible they have fulfilled their KYC/AML obligations and don't care where Alice got the money or where Bob sends it after he receives it.  It depends if you look at the LN transaction as one contiguous transaction from Alice to Charlie or as a series of coordinated transactions strung together.
There really isn't any traditional banking example I can think of that's similar.  If Alice wants to pay Charlie in the traditional banking world, she either gives Charlie cash, writes him a check, sends him an ACH bank transfer, or uses a service like Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, etc.
I certainly hope the scope of KYC/AML is going to be limited to the LN channel partners.  If it's not, then it's nearly impossible to comply with KYC/AML and every LN node could possibly be classified as a [Money Transmitter]( and be required to register with FinCEN and comply with many other financial regulations.  LN would be doomed.

1) You absolutely pay the fee, it's just already baked into the price of the item or service you're purchasing.
2) While the credit card authorization is instant, the vendor doesn't receive the payment immediately.  Some vendors get paid nightly, but some only get paid weekly or bi-weekly.
3) There is also the risk of charge-back to the vendor and a risk of fraud to the credit card issuer.  
All of these problems are solved with Lightning Network.  Fees will be so cheap that they're not even a factor.  Vendors will get paid immediately.  There's no risk of chargeback to the vendor, although this is a double-edged sword because chargebacks are an important consumer protection.  I imagine some LN hubs will emerge that will provide consumer protections in exchange for a slightly higher fee.

@_date: 2018-04-08 16:19:40
I think it depends on how the entire transaction is interpreted by the government. 
For example, let’s say Alice and Bob each have LN channels open with an Exchange. Bob also has a channel open with Charlie. Alice wants to pay Charlie, so the path is Alice —&gt; Exchange —&gt; Bob —&gt; Charlie. 
Does the Exchange have to have KYC/AML with Charlie?
The entire LN transaction is obviously Alice to Charlie; however, each hop is technically a separate smart contract. The exchange knows Alice and Bob and the bitcoins only traveled on those two smart contracts, that could be enough to cover their backs from a KYC/AML perspective.  I’m not sure if anyone knows for sure. 
To answer your original question, I don’t think operating an LN for fees is a viable business model yet, just like mining for only fees (without the block reward) is viable yet. 
I think organizations are going to open LN nodes that provide large amounts of liquidity in order to attract customers.  
Think of the way most people refill their checking accounts today.  They use direct deposit from a payroll processor.  Employers could have LN channels open to one, or maybe a few, payroll processors. Employees could have LN channels open to a payroll processor for each job. The payroll processing companies could have fat bidirectional channels in a mesh network.
Since most companies that sell anything also have employees to pay and most people that buy stuff from companies spend the money they earned from an employer, the LN could be bootstrapped with payroll processors as the main payment hubs.

Because there is currently no technical way to do both in a timely manner.  SegWit is written, tested, already deployed on Litecoin, and ready to go live whenever the miners decide to activate it or August 1, whichever happens first.  
Increasing the block size would be a hard fork, and there is no tested code ready to go at this point.  The New York (Silbert) Agreement is technically incompatible with the current deployment of SegWit, so the code would have to be re-written, re-tested, and re-deployed.  All of this simply can't be done responsibly in less than 12-18 months.  Don't take my word for it, ask any software professional.
The quickest way to alleviate the congestion is to activate SegWit now, then get to work on deciding whether or not Bitcoin needs larger blocks.  If larger blocks are truly needed, the community will get it done responsibly.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:33:05
Not exactly.  He has enough hash power (ASIC chips used in bitcoin mining) to delay activating SegWit until BIP-148 goes into effect on August 1, 2017.  If he doesn't play ball then, there could be a blockchain split, which could be either permanent or temporary, nobody is quite sure how that would play out.  He definitely has the power and political influence to activate SegWit, he just refuses to do it because he has a patent on a software technical advantage over other miners that earns his company and estimated $100M extra per year.

Users are the ones activating SegWit on Aug 1 with UASF BIP 148 (if the miners don't preempt it by activating SegWit earlier with MASF BIP 141.)  Exchanges and businesses will follow the users.  Miners will be forced to follow the users, exchanges, and businesses.  Miners would be wise to get on board now, because they have a lot of investment in hardware at risk.
There are many problems with the 2 MB blocks, the biggest being that it's just not necessary with SegWit at this time.

Miners have the most to lose if there is a chain split.  They have millions invested in hash power, possibly borrowed from sketchy lenders, that uses an insane amount of electricity.  Most of them go hand to mouth, using mining receipts to pay for the hardware and electricity.  Going even a few days on the wrong chain would be the same as going a few days without food and water.  They might survive, but it would be a very unpleasant experience.  The miners really have no choice but to accept UASF or trigger a MASF.  Bitmain will blink, but they will probably wait until the last possible moment so they can maximize their covert Asicboost profits as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:43:54
Why should we wait 12-18 months to do something that has been ready to go for quite some time already, would give us an immediate capacity increase, and would enable Layer 2 with all kinds of unimaginable magic down the line?
Also, there is no firm commitment from Bitmain to deploy SegWit.  The wording of the New York (Silbert) Agreement is sufficiently vague enough to provide plausible deniability to miners if they back out.  It says SegWit will be activated when 80% of miners signal for it.  It does not commit any of the miners to signal for it.
Many of us do not ever expect Bitmain to signal for SegWit or allow it to be activated because it would block asicboost and take away their competitive advantage.

Some guy named Satoshi Nakamoto said, "The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more hash power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."
With the current enormous hash rate, many orders of magnitude more than any other crypto, it would be prohibitively expensive to try to overpower the rest of the network.  That's where much of the network the security comes from.
If Bitcoin changed the POW to something based on CPU or GPU, it would be inherently less secure until the hash rate was sufficiently rebuilt to a point where it is prohibitively expensive to try to overpower the network.
I fully support Core and their professional engineering approach to Bitcoin and I don't think we need bigger blocks once SegWit is activated, but we have to respect that the miners are a necessary evil because they provide the hash power that secures the network.
I'm all for other companies developing ASICs to help break the mining cartel, rather than changing the POW and damaging Bitcoin.

If you do nothing with the coins, that's the equivalent of hodling them, which will reduce the supply and keep the price higher than it should be, which could also hold the Bitcoin price down if the market decides that this is a split value proposition.  The same applies for those considering sending the coins to a burn address.
The best way to damage that BCH economy is to sell the coins, which will increase supply and cause the price to drop.   If you're uncomfortable with the dirty money on your hands, donate the proceeds to a worthy charity.  They will do something good with it and everybody wins.

Assuming that the miners do not activate SegWit before August 1.  If 51% of miners choose the BIP-148 chain, then there will not be a split.  If 0% of miners choose the BIP-148 chain, it will never activate.  If somewhere between 1% and 50% choose the BIP-148 chain, there will a split and coins will be active on both chains.  This could last anywhere between a few hours to forever.
Unless the legacy chain also does a soft fork at the same time, any coins on the legacy chain could get wiped out at any time 51% of miners switch to the BIP-148 chain.  That's called a reorganization and the mechanics of it are quite complicated.  Here's a link:

Or that SegWit-only-for-now would not work position was taken so that a subset of miners could take advantage of a protocol bug called covert asicboost so that they could maximize their personal profits for as long as possible.  There's no other plausible explanation for rejecting SegWit.  
Once the UASF was launched, that subset of miners had more to lose by not activating SegWit than by activating it, so they concocted this SegWit2x scheme which allows them to activate SegWit in a slightly different manner to save face.
As far as the miners making demands and voting, that's just ridiculous.  Miners are essentially heavy equipment operators.  When was the last time a heavy equipment manufacturer took engineering advice from backhoe operators?

The are really only two attack surfaces for quantum computing:
1) The only “old addresses” that are vulnerable to quantum computing are the old addresses that have been reused. Any bitcoin address’ public key is not revealed until coins are spent, so there is no attack surface for old addresses that have not been reused.  This is why modern wallets spend the entire output value, paying the unspent remainder to a new change address. I don’t have any statistics on how many current old addresses are vulnerable, but I would expect the vast majority of old addresses to be safe. 
2) The other attack surface is tx that are in the mempool, or possibly those with only a few confirmations. The possibility of having quantum computers hijack these tx is real with the current encryption algorithm, although I’m not sure how practical it would be to hijack them. 
In order to completely quantum-proof Bitcoin, the encryption algorithm needs to be changed. Unless someone can figure out a way to change the encryption algorithm with a soft fork, we’re looking at a hard fork.

I disagree.  Pretty much anything can be fractionally reserved by a custodian.  For example, let's say I decide to open a company that holds and lends apples.  People deposit apples with my company for safekeeping, and my company lends them out to other people who need apples.  If my company receives deposits of 100 apples, my company could lend out 90 of those apples to other people, only holding 10 in reserve in case depositors show up to withdraw an apple.  Everything is cool until somebody shows up to withdraw the 11th (or more) apple, that's when an apple run occurs and my company either gets bailed out by a generous apple benefactor or it goes out of business and the apple depositors lose their apples.
The main difference between fiat and Bitcoin is that the Federal Reserve is the lender of last resort and can simply print more fiat to bail out the banks.  The Federal Reserve cannot print more bitcoins, so there is no lender of last resort.  If someone trusts a Custodian with their bitcoins and that Custodian becomes insolvent, those bitcoins are very likely lost forever.  See [Mt. Gox](

I don't think the fractional reserve system of lending would work with Bitcoin because it depends on the magical creation of more money each time they loan money they don't really have.
Even if people do trust their savings to banks in order to earn a little bit of interest, the banks will only be able to lend Bitcoins 1:1 because it's just not possible to create more Bitcoins out of thin air.  
That brings to question how people will be able to get mortgages and other loans if the fiat system dies.  Interest rates would have to be exorbitant because risk is distributed 1:1 instead of 1:Many.

I see your point, but I think the situation is a lot more complicated.  BIP141 requires 95% of miners to signal for SegWit by Aug 1 to activate SegWit.  If that doesn't happen, BIP148 will go into effect, where all nodes running the BIP148 binaries will actively reject non-SegWit blocks, which could cause a chain split if less than 51% of the miners choose the BIP148 chain.  It will only take 51% of the miners choosing the BIP148 chain on Aug 1 to avoid a chain split.  
In addition, if 51% of the miners choose the BIP148 chain at any point between Aug 1 and Nov 15, the legacy chain will get reorganized and all transactions on that chain would be lost unless the Bitmain coalition miners also implement a softfork or checkpoint to preserve the legacy chain permanently.  This is where your point about allowing the fee market to make the decision comes into play.
GBMiners is one of the first mining pools to defect from Bitcoin Unlimited to BIP148, which means that Bitmain's coalition is not as strong as they would like everyone to believe.  That is a very significant development because getting the first domino to fall is always the hardest.
I fully expect that other mining pools will peel away from the Bitmain coalition between now and Aug 1, which will build enough momentum for at least 51% of the hashrate to change allegiances. 
Nobody who cares about bitcoin's future wants a chain split.  The Bitmain coalition has taken a hard line position that doesn't allow them any way to save face if they activate BIP141.  They may be quietly allowing members of their coalition to change allegiances to get to 51% so BIP148 succeeds without a chain split.  Then they can go along with it and cry foul in order to get their block size increase.  But that's one whale of a conspiracy theory!

Not only is fiat constantly getting diluted forever, more and more people are entering the Bitcoin market around the world.  Price is simply a product of supply and demand.  The price will only stabilize when demand stabilizes.  We've only scratched the surface with demand, which will (hopefully) grow exponentially.  That means the price of Bitcoin will also grow exponentially.  
A factor of 10 from today's price would be $28K per Bitcoin.  A factor of 100 would be $280k per Bitcoin.  A factor of 1000 would be $2.8M per Bitcoin.  Where it stops, nobody knows.

We could have anywhere from 1 to 3 different blockchains if the entire community does not get behind a single option.  The market hates uncertainty, so prices should be volatile leading up to August 1 or an agreement.  
The good news is that anyone buying bitcoin before the blockchain split(s) will have duplicate coins on every branch, so as long as one of the options succeeds we will be fine.  
The bad news is that if the blockchain splits, the expectation is that the price of coins on each branch will take a huge (hopefully temporary) hit.
The worst case scenario is that any blockchain split(s) could weaken all branches to the point where users, miners, investors, and developers move to a different altcoin leaving all three branches worth less or even worth nothing at all.

If you want to sell BCH coins right away, you need to have your BTC on an exchange that supports both BTC and BCH today.  Once the first block of BCH is mined (which will likely be 12-16 hours) the exchange will create your BCH coins and you can sell them (ironically, off-chain) and send your BTC back to your private wallet.
The alternative is to wait until after the first BCH block is mined, then send the new BCH coins to an exchange in order to sell them.  But even if your transaction got into the next block, it would likely take 10-12 hours to arrive and another day or two to get 6 confirmations, so the exchange wouldn't allow you to sell them for 2-3 days.
It looks like there will be several waves of BCH sellers.  Those who have their BTC staged on an exchange to sell right away, 2-3 days later when the first BCH-only transfers are allowed to sell, and then consistently afterwards as the more conservative sellers trickle in.

It matters very much.  A mining pool that was very loyal to Bitmain just swung over to SegWit, so the dominoes are starting to fall in favor of SegWit.  It's only a matter of time until a critical mass of 20% of the hashrate follows suit.  Once that happens, the miners that are on the fence are going to blink and do the safe thing, which will force Jihan to cave in and activate SegWit.  Let's hope it happens leading up to August 1 so we don't have a split chain and lose too much value.

Aren't most transactions in "digital fiat" these days, at least in the developed countries?  Almost every transaction I make is with credit card, debit card, or ACH payment, and I think that's the norm for most Americans these days.  If I spent $100 USD in paper or coins a month, I'd be surprised.
I am disappointed in the amount of places that accept digital payments directly by phone, meaning Apple/Samsung pay or PayPal/Venmo/Zelle/CashApp.  Having to whip out a slice of plastic to make a payment seems ridiculous when I have a very powerful handheld computer in my pocket.

The BIP148 chain will have to find 2016 blocks within the 107 days of the activation window (Aug 1 - Nov 15) or SegWit won't activate and that whole chain will be worthless. 
The Proof of Work difficulty also adjusts every 2016 blocks. At the current difficulty as current cumulative hash rate, blocks are found about every 10 minutes, which is about 2 weeks.  
It would take 12-15% of the current hash rate to find 2016 blocks in 107 days, so that is the bare minimum for SegWit to be successfully deployed this year.

There's no guarantee that the initial value of BTCa + BTCb will be the same value as BTC on July 31.  There's a chance of up to 4 separate chains will emerge:  Current BTC may survive, BIP148 UASF may happen, SegWit2x may happen, and Bitmain's version may happen.
Users and investors may decide that all the BTC forks are a mess and move their money to altcoins or back to fiat.
With that said, we can look to Ethereum's history as an indicator of how things may turn out.  ETC is now worth more than ETH was before their controversial hard fork and the new ETH is booming, so having tokens on all the forks may end up being of higher value than BTC on July 31.

I couldn't disagree more.  The current implementation of SegWit as a SF has been in development for more than 2 years, has been fully tested on the testnet, and has been successfully deployed on Litecoin.  It's been ready for Miner Activation since November 15, 2016.  It will provide immediate scaling relief, fix transaction malleability, and kill covert asicboost*.
The vaporware SegWit2x HF that you're promoting simply cannot be coded, tested, and deployed safely in less than 12-18 months.  The risk of rushing the deployment and having a bug is simply too great.
The only sane method to give us any capacity increase in the next 12-18 months is to activate SegWit as a MASF as soon as possible, then start working on a HF to increase the block size.
*Killing covert asicboost is the only reason the miners oppose the current implementation of SegWit.  They want it rewritten as a HF to preserve their unfair competitive advantage for their own personal financial gain.

Well, that's where the legalities get sticky, at least in the USA.  At some point, if Bob relays more than a State-defined number of transactions to other people or businesses, he will have to register as Money Transmitter with his State. [Source - Wikipedia](

For instance, Bitcoin Exchanges, Western Union, Visa, Mastercard, etc. could open legitimate money transmitter hubs and facilitate the Lightning Network transactions.  But that's bad for the bitcoin philosophy because the new boss would be the same as the old boss.

Everyone realizes that SegWit is necessary at this point, the debate has gone from whether or not it's needed to how to implement it; whether by MASF, UASF, or FrankenSegWit HF.  
Your time would be better spent lobbying the miners to activate SegWit with the BIP141 MASF to get an immediate capacity increase, then make a case for larger blocks.

There are a finite supply of bitcoins, which are currently divisible 8 decimal places.  It's possible to subdivide even further with a software upgrade, so theoretically, the whole universe could run off of a single bitcoin someday.
As for now, bitcoins are subject to the laws of supply and demand, so a shrinking supply would trigger a price increase if demand stayed the same or increased.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:02:35
Nobody wants a split chain.  The only sane method to increase capacity within the next 12-18 months is to activate the current implementation of SegWit.  We would all prefer the BIP141 MASF that has been ready for activation since November 15, 2016, because it would be the safest course of action; however, the capacity and fee issues have gotten completely out of control and something must be done to break the stalemate.
In the business world, there's an axiom "Deadlines make deals happen."  The August 1 deadline for the BIP141 MASF or BIP148 UASF is the only way to get the miners to activate SegWit one way or the other.  The users cannot, should not, and will not allow the miners to hold Bitcoin hostage for their own personal financial gain any longer.
If there is a chain split, that lands on the miners for being greedy.  Their greed will ultimately be their downfall.

You're being dishonest here.  The Federal Reserve requires a 10% fractional reserve minimum for banks with over $500M in deposits, so the maximum one dollar can expand to due to fractional reserve banking is ten dollars.  (N*1/0.1) is the formula.  
There's no logistical reason that bitcoins or apples can't be borrowed and re-lent over-and-over again, just like dollars.  Except there's no Federal Reserve to enforce the 10% reserve and no lender of last resort for a bail out in the event of a bank run.
If every Exchange loaned out 90% of their deposits over and over again, their holdings would expand ~~the~~ their bitcoin supply 10x.  Without knowing how many bitcoins Exchanges hold, I can't say for sure what kind of effect that would have on the overall bitcoin market.  Say, for example, exchanges hold 1M BTC, expanding the working supply to 10M BTC would have a massive effect.

My concern is that there are only 106 days (Aug 1 - Nov 15) for the BIP148 UASF chain to find 2016 blocks for the PoW difficulty adjustment ~~and another 2016 blocks (roughly 14 days)~~ with 95% SegWit blocks to activate SegWit before BIP148 expires.
~~Backing out the second 14 day period, there are only 92 days to get the first 2016 blocks.~~  That means it will require a minimum average hash rate of about ~~15.3%~~ 13.2% of the July 31 hash rate to get SegWit activated before BIP148 times out.  Starting at 1% would be tough sledding.
Edit: I realized that BIP148 does not require a second set of 2016 blocks.  If the first 2016 blocks all signal for SegWit, and they will because the BIP148 nodes will reject everything else, then that first set of 2016 blocks is enough to satisfy the 95% requirement.

I absolutely agree that lending bitcoin is impractical because it's deflational and it's very risky because there is no lender of last resort; however, implementing a bitcoin fractional reserve is quite possible and it could be already implemented at any custodial service.
The consumer debt piece is quite interesting.  I agree that consumer debt is out of control, but there needs to be some level of practical borrowing for major purchases or the economy will grind to a halt.  If people have to save up to buy a house with cash, for example, the number of qualified buyers would drop exponentially and houses would be extremely difficult to sell.  This would reduce demand for construction, appraisers, title companies, realtors, lawyers, etc.  Those workers would have less money to spend in other sectors, and the economy would tank.  We'd essentially be back to the 18th or 19th centuries when people had to be largely self-reliant to produce their own housing and consumables.
