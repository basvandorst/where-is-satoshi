Anyone else unable to fund their gdax account? I can only transfer from my gdp wallet on coinbase which I also can't deposit into

I was gonna right out some sentimental bullshit but I'm gonna be straight, grow up. Bitcoin is going to go back up it is just dipping for now. Killing yourself and leaving your kids without a dad or wait it out and watch it go back up. Easy fucking choice, nobody wants a dead dad for Christmas

Sold my LTC to top up my bitcoin. Looks like a silly mistake today but gotta think about the long run

Noob here. What's electrum wallet? I have coin base but no bitcoins yet.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:54:50
So if I bought some via coin base I'd then transfer them to my wallet and I'd have control of them not coin base? 
Also Im trying to understand the fork. If I had 1 bitcoin in breadwallet or electrum do I then have 1 bitcoin and 1 of the new currency?
Sorry for all the questions it's just all very new
