It's not directly BTC but certificates/ETNs for BTC. You need 200 of those certificates to have the equivalent of 1 BTC.

It's not exactly a shit ton of bitcoin though, at least not for a big company. The certificate shown here is priced in SEK and it takes ~200 certificates to have the equivalent of 1 BTC.
On the table on this screenshot they have bought 19.1k certs and sold 9.9k -&gt; actually bought 9.2k certificates. Divided by 200 that's about 46 BTC worth of certificates.

Exactly, which is also why this whole JP Morgan "proof" screenshot here is useless.

They didn't broker Bitcoin purchase. They brokered purchases of ETNs for Bitcoin issued by [XBT Provider]( The amount of certificates is insignificant though.

It's legit, but not in the way OP presents it. The ledger shows purchases of ETN/certificates. You need 20 of them to have the equivalent of 1 BTC, so 'thousands' of BTC is most likely just hundreds.

Love it :D

They don't really. They broker certificates/ETN for BTC that are issued by [Bitcoin XBT.](

It absolutely is for clients, and the amount of Bitcoin traded here is insignificant.
The certificate shown on the screenshot is priced in SEK and it takes 200 certificates to have the equivalent of 1 BTC.

... and it's much less than that. The currency of this ETN is SEK, not EUR. Then consider the fact that they bought 19k yet also sold 9.9k, so essentially they only bought 9.1k of them.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:26:00
About 5-6k BTC.

Sorry, I'm new here :p

The screenshot is legit. The issue is that many people here clearly have absolutely zero clue what the screenshot is showing. In terms of JPM manipulating BTC to buy them for cheap, the screenshot proves nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:02:15
The latter.
