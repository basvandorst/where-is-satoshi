Your timing isn't very good.  We have a few people trying to game this sub for tips and it's turning people off from tipping.  It's funny that they're actually working against their own agenda.  Good luck next time!

8 decimals will be enough.  Sidechains will gain space and eliminate the need for more decimals.  We will stop using bitcoin for everyday transactions because it is so valuable and instead use a sidechain that is distributed and inflationary but tied to the bitcoin blockchain.  Everyone will still accept bitcoin of course, because it is so coveted and will convert to any sidechain you want, but it will become uncommon and maybe something that only wealthy use regularly.
  
We'll look back at the small tips thrown around here in amazement, just like we do when we look back at the beginning and the first pizza.

That was really dumb if it's true.  There is a trusted user on reddit that will help you with this.  Now you have no guarantees.
   
But, somehow, I feel this will end in tips..
