Congratulations on getting the joke.

Jiggle the cord, or try turning it off and back on again.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:47:41


Yep... Been in Bitcoin 7 years, never been to Bitcoin.com once, Bitcoin isn't a company, and Satoshi's vision at this point is completely irrelevant.

There's nothing saying that investment has to be under one account, or under an account that only lasts 'untiljune', before signing up for yet another new one. There are many legitimate reasons for not wanting to keep a coherent history in any one account or company's servers. Not everyone wants to be a Roger or Antonopolous.

Or do some kind of trial.

What is this 'cash out' thing? It doesn't sound like something I'd like to get involved in.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:48:34
I like the 'wake up' fact.

@_date: 2017-04-13 22:43:30
Pretty scary that newbies might stumble upon bitcoin**.com** before anything else... and assume it has some sort of official status.

I'm switching to North Korean dollars.
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:37:46
I chuckled.

"Takes one to know one"?
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:20:47


There's no such thing though.

It might be FUD but reddit account age is irrelevant.

We already passed the halfway point.... $1414
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:34:59
Duh, hence the quotation marks. It is however the exact phrase that people have repeated in this thread. And we all know what they mean by it even if they've chosen the wrong label.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:49:15
I got around to it (I think my cheapest coin was $0.79) and then sold thousands of them for $10 each... I was waaaaaay in the black and yet you can still see that as someone who sold thousands of coins for $10 each. Pretty much just Joe Blow 9-5 guy now with a mortgage and shit job.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:24:31
Not here, but people on *bitcoin.org/smf* certainly did.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:08:06
May I be bold and mention what an impact that aliasing is having on my eyes.

What is bip148?
And secondary question, where is the best place to look up plain-english descriptions of bips? (For when the inevitable happens and someone else assumes we all know what a particular bip is).

Plus, their personal key could open other things that others *aren't* allowed access to, all while only having to carry one key.

No, he basically became a drug kingpin, creating a safe space for dealers and traffickers. So basically an admirable person.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:25:12


Which shouldn't be a crime.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:46:41


There's no such thing though.
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:32:51
Remindme! Where to put a 'c' in the word 'Bitoin'.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:58:37


I agree with this part. That's what they are using the phrase to mean. I still haven't seen/heard any proof that he was a scumbag though. Scumbags steal. Scumbags aggress on other people and put them in cages.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:21:34
Add me too if you like, as long as you're compiling one.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:32:40


Again with the generalisations. That is not *my* entire purpose for using bitcoin. For me it represents a store of value, theft prevention, financial privacy. Transaction speed is not high on my priority list, nor is "cheap fees".
The whole thing will not 'go away' just because it can't be used as day-to-day cash.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:16:02
For me, it's a feeling of annoyance and heartache that I *had* to sell in the past even though I never wanted to. Really long stint at unemployment, no other assets, and the only thing keeping my kids fed was selling off BTC for a while. Ugh, all those $10 coins...
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:14:32


Just do what I do... check the price in AUD.
D'oh, still 'only' $1932.
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:40:38
Today is shit?
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:27:37
Yeah, even my phone's 'small change' (~0.1) is $200 now... it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:53:36
100 USD would be 0.0625 BTC
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:16:06
Yeah I specifically remember because at that price ($266), $70k turned out to be ~266 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:36:11


Lol, if muggers need finances to provide you lunch, does that mean it wasn't theft if they mug you and then buy you lunch the next day?

FWIW, I'm pro-organized [peaceful] crime and I've subbed here for years.

The most encouraging thing for me is to see how involved Nigeria is becoming. They were really big on e-gold in the *golden* days before US gov completely neutered it. Hopefully millions of Nigerians and alike will see bitcoin as a US-takedown-resistent e-gold in many ways.
@_date: 2017-05-21 09:09:51
Don't know. Maybe it's not pumped up full of tiny credit card payments like coinbase et al.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:38:25
btc-e is usually one of the lowest... but $2001 right now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:54:21
I didn't miss that at all. Did you miss the part where I said I haven't seen or heard any proof? Even the courts couldn't prove it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:00:40
There's this thing call 'supply' (currently the amount of transactions that can fit in a block) and this other thing called 'demand' (how many people want to get a transaction into the next block.
Unfortunately, people seem to think supply should be infinite regardless of demand, and everyone's transactions included at near zero fee all day every day.
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:33:59
Lol, I understood too. Are you guys a comedy duo or just argument beings?
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:11:46


Wow, thank you. This whole thread just to find this one line.
I wish there was and easy list like this of bip# vs name / one-line description.
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:06:32


Do they offer a way to donate to them without bragging? I'd like to send them some money, but don't want to feel compelled to tell everyone on reddit about it.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:52:14
I clearly remember putting in a LOT of money at the $266 top... that was the ATH for a very long time, so the $70,000 I put in at that point took ages to recover. Should have kept them til now, huh?

If someone killed him, his punishment *was* excessive.

Complicit in what? I'm saying it shouldn't be a crime for two individuals to engage in voluntary trade of personal-use chemicals.

Or watch the original "we use coins" video again if the whitepaper is too sterile for you.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:33:18
So disgusting. Who were the victims exactly?


So, buy low, sell high, but make sure you ask daddy government first, or they'll imprison you.


Yes, I see that as a big problem too - a problem with the law.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:30:47
Of course it matters. It's the reason he's the bitcoin 'fall guy'.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:45:45
Sorry. It wouldn't have surprised me even in this sub to find someone believing legality is 100% correlated with morality.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:53:43
Yeah, I'm pretty broke but for me that imaginary figure is about $138,000,000 since I've been in since 2011.

1\. winning
2\. an argument being
3\. right
4\. winning
Ah yeah I guess 4 doesn't count since it's the same as 1.
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:31:47
To be honest, I'm more suprised by the 0.02 LTC/BTC ratio lately.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:19:02
It means the more people with access to potentially secret (from the government) wealth and transactions, the more difficult it will be for governments to raise taxes. Starving a government of taxes might be thought of as regulating it (e.g. how much damage it can do).
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:59:23


Point taken. Just as the flip-side is true too I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:02:04
Yeah about 8 months.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:12:30
I don't dispute that they are currently illegal and that people get prosecuted for doing illegal things, however that doesn't change my assertion.
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:18:28


Just a case, no power supply or mobo.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:42:34


Nope, only one of those things.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:55:28
So I was ¼ right.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:19:50
I C what you did there. No more C increments for you.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:18:25


What does that even mean?

Exactly. My computer has 12B of RAM.

The only thing that irks me is that you're coming from a place of "higher fees is automatically a bad thing". I realise its just an opinion piece but right from the start, the worthiness of the goal (i.e lower fees) is subjective.
