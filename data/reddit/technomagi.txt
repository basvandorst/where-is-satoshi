Yes and yes. I mined at least 1btc ages ago using 2x Radeon 6850s. This was the only wallet used. Interesting.

PA, USA. Blockchain info claims my balance is zero? Could it be because I've moved my wallet off the original hdd?

It's not actually true.

I stream as well. I'll tell you that posting your shit content on here, where it isn't appropriate in the slightest, isn't the way to go about finding viewers. You're more likely to lose viewers, as the potentials who see this link will just see you as an asshole and not give you a chance.

I've heard this 3 or 4 times now, right before the break and value significantly falls.

That's an invalid reason. You don't need a middle name included on a transfer. And either way, it'd be on the ID you're providing to pick up a $300+ transfer. And $500 isn't too much. I sent $700 through WU 2 months ago. To me it just sounds like you're either an idiot or full of shit, trying to get another rise from Bitcoin's awful community.

No one in this sub wants to admit bitcoin is inconvenient as fuck for many money transfers. Especially for someone on time constraints or who isn't overly computer literate.

True story. I've had to use it several times in the past year to get money to my girlfriend while she's on contract on the other side of the country. She has no PC or time to sell/convert shitcoin, like most average people. WU is pricey but an ease to use. Never had a problem. This sub really has gone to shit, though. Every time I see a post I wonder why I'm subbed.

Sure, but how likely is that? In massive cities it's a possibility. For the absolute vast majority? Not a chance. It's interesting to read about how so many people are familiar with bitcoin, but the reality is different. Outside of my close friends, no one I know is aware of it. Not a single person I work with. I can't think of a local company. There are no Bitcoin ATMs here, and likely aren't any within 50+ miles. Maybe eventually, but I doubt it.

Honestly, no, and it never will. One of two things need to happen. First is for Bitcoin to become accepted everywhere, for everything... and I don't see Bitcoin doing that. Maybe years down the line, with some other "Cryptocurrency," but not Bitcoin. The second is instant conversion. Some service that will kick your Bitcoin to USD or whatever currency in an instant, no holding, delay, etc. Directly from wallet. But that's not how it works, nor will it ever. If I'm sending money to family, they likely need it immediately, not 3-4 days down the line after sending the coin to a 3rd party to sell off and convert to actual currency, then send a check or transfer to bank or whatever.
