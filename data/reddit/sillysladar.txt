I think I'm going to be crucified for saying this but.
We were going to doing some Bitcoin stuff on the consumer level. We were located in Toronto and I wanted to buy my first 20 dollars worth of Bit Coins on a Sunday.  It literally took me till Monday mid day to purchase them. 
We first went to ( but their website look like it's from the 90's and the verification would take way to long.
We then went to QB ( that wouldn't accept our Bank (We are with CIBC)
We then went to the Bitcoin Market and posted this and got no actually responses
We then went to  and no one would sell us less then 50 dollars using payment method we have.
When then went to  and bough some but it took 48 hours to get them a fact made clear on the site only after we purchased them.
On Monday I went to the Toronto ATM, which is in the shadiest building I have seen, and the machine was down. I had to get them to reset it, then I found out it doesn't take debit so I had to get cash from another ATM down the street, insert the money and then I got Bitcoins. 
All together the largest problem for me getting involved in Bitcoin was getting Bitcoins. And the fact in Toronto due to the amount of walking and travelling I had to two during this whole exchange I was offered to exchange my money for Marijuana twice by people on the street.
