He has a bunch of more videos on his channel. I think he makes 1 video per month or something like that. Its a great resource. Ive donated through change tip but i will also be buying his book for sure.  
  
 I feel like there is a shortage of bitcoin programming tutorials and he does a very good job. I think if we had more resources like this that people can use to engage bitcoin it would be a good thing.

Here ya go.
Use that and you will have a better chance at knowing if the transaction will confirm or not. If confidence factor is greater than or equal to 95% then issue virtual good. Or 90% or whatever you want..  
If confidence factor is lower then your X then wait for a certain amount of confirmations for the transaction to clear.

I like the ledger nano! I just got the nano "s" so i cant comment on it yet but i can comment on ledger the company. I dont think i have had a better experience anywhere else in the bitcoin community. Great company and great people.   
That said, the latest shapeshift integration with the keepkey has got my attention and i will probably give them my business next. People give Trezor a thumbs up but i havent had the pleasure of using one so i cant comment.
Before i got a hardware wallet i was using electrum and i still use it tho the majority of my coins are in a nano. Electrum has been great and very forgiving so i gotta give a shot out to camp Electrum!

Robinhood does not sell bitcoins. They sell you an imitation that you can not remove from their platform, you can only sell it for dollars. Meaning they sell something that is pegged to the bitcoin price but you cant withdraw it to a bitcoin wallet so its not bitcoin. Bitcoin gives you the opportunity and the privilege of being your own bank! Dont let anyone ever rob you of that privilege.   
Purchase bitcoins from an exchange and remove it from the exchange and store it in your own personal bitcoin wallet. That way you have 100% control of said bitcoin. You are not at the mercy of a third party telling you when and where you can spend it.  
Get yourself a hardware wallet like a "Ledger Nano S" or a "Trezor" and make yourself familiar with it. Control your finances and control your destiny as they say. Pay attention to the opportunity that is presented along with bitcoin. Its not just money. Its freedom, its financial sovereignty, its a privilege that was not available to the generations before. Be responsible and be mindful of your operational security and learn as much as you can about what bitcoin is so that you have an understanding of its value outside of the price. 
Eventually you will have an aha moment and you will lurk no more. You will be one of us.

Its because you understand you have been shoveling opportunity out the window! I think its an after effect of becoming a bitcoiner. 


 A long time ago I used to have a large Caramel Macchiato every morning at Starbucks and one day i decided to quit. I quit because it was part of a daily routine that involved coffee, junk food, cigarettes and just nonsense that was consuming about $30 daily before my day even began. 
Me quitting that routine has now turned into a game of what else can i get rid of.

I already sent $3 bucks..   
 
When i sent it.. i meant it as a small gesture. I wasnt implying multibit was worth that. If they wanted to charge for it then state the price and if i deem it worthwhile i will simply pay for it.  
Calling it donationware and then taking a piece of every transaction while possibly introducing new privacy issues is not what i had in mind when i made the gesture.

Its too late Jim, I have already transfered all my funds to another wallet and i have uninstalled MultiBit. I simply do NOT agree with your approach. Its ok to disagree... Im not hear to hurl insults at you or anything like that. I simply do not agree and i have chosen to NOT use or recommend multibit anymore.   
That said i think you guys actually rock. I have been using Mutibit for a good bit now and for the most part ive had a good experience. Thats what makes this a lil painful! Nonetheless whats done is done. Everyone has their choices and my choice is to NOT use multibit anymore.
 
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:37:37
Hello, i had a quick question about network propagation. Network propagation is the number of nodes that have heard about your transaction before its confirmed.  
  
That said, before its confirmed..  How many nodes hear about a typical or average transaction in the first few minutes?  Say in the first 2-3 min???

Time is an internal cadence we verify via observing a moment while correlating it with a future that hasn't occurred yet. Sometimes you are observing a moment and you are correlating it to something that has already happened but a cadence no less.

Go to the corner of demand and convenience and start pitching your spiel! Once you get there, among other things you will see a bunch of other people just like you pitching their spiel!  
  
If you fail i suggest you take a moment to listen to the spiel of the other people there and figure out a plan to best them while keeping your profit margin acceptable.  
Do that over and over again until you see people starting to copy your spiel.

Hey there, do you know the processing capabilities of your node in terms of how much it can handle? Do you use it to handle transactions for a store front or just private use?  I need a node to process data from multiple store fronts and at one point i was looking into pi based nodes but i was told it may not be adequate for my intended use.  Does the cluster of pi's change that? Do you think your node is capable of handling data from multiple store fronts?

I wonder what satoshi thinks of asics. Sorry to hear about your experience at Cointerra.. I kinda of gave up on mining and not because im financially locked out but because i felt what you are feeling now a ways back and decided the risk vs reward ratio was not in my favor. At the same time i felt as the industry had a sort of predatory behavior attached to their business models and the community was inducing it..   
  
It was not probable for me to find a vendor that carried the traits that i expected from your household electronics name brand. Funny enough the first asic i targeted for ownership had a big red sign on their website that said **no support, no warranty, bitcoin only** and they sold out in record time!  
  
It seems "we" have created this environment and not the asic vendors. It seems "we" have let them set this standard and i think its up to us to correct this behavior so as much as i hate ..( fill in asic vendor here ) i think "we" can do a lot better.  So when you ask me ..   
  
    
 &gt;&gt;Who in the right mind would want to deal with scumbags like them?...
  
 Ill give you a hint, it starts with "w" and ends in "e".
We need a more decentralized bitcoin mining landscape.. I dont think enough of us mine and since a lot of us fall under the same risk profile that risk to reward ratio i was talking about earlier handcuffs us to our decision to NOT mine leaving mining to people who have a rather large footprint in the bitcoin mining arena.
  
So we have a lot of work to do and when i say we i dont mean the ftc.

You mean the price. The price and the value of a bitcoin are two different things. Thats probably the hardest thing to grasp about bitcoin.

Dont worry by default they will be monitored for sound, video, gps by the FEDS and they will also siphon any data on your smartphone, tablet, laptop and will associate you with the address you are traversing to for life. After they force a bunch of "ask your doctor ads" down your throat for the extent of the ride they will offer you a discount for your blood and then they will offer you you a "gift card" to have "vaccines" injected into your kids on the spot where they will insert rfid and other bio monitors that will track, locate and terminate you on the spot if need be. Any questions, good. /

My research shows by 2021 bitcoiners will totally be flying while everyone else looks at us like we were zod from superman. The fear of flying bitcoiners will lead to the banning of all flying objects including planes so society can concentrate on catching the nakamotos in the sky ...

Have you not heard of cost averaging!! If you bought at 800 and it fell to 400 just buy another at 400 and your average price you paid for each will be lower! If you had bought another you would have it even at 600 so you would be in the positive right now since we are at 620 ish!!

People just want the price to be more than the all time high. If the price of bitcoin was 700 he would still tell you bitcoin is crippled... 
 Not only that but it seems some people just cant separate the price of a bitcoin from its value!

 Well somebody had jobs .. 
Im not to proud of the vast amounts of inequality and the current state of concentrations of wealth so if i have a choice i would tread carefully in regards to how we "all" move forward. Guess we could just rinse and repeat the age of industrial monopolies and just replace "industrial" with technological. Some of us are tired of the rinse and repeat and its crystal clear that the smaller the **concentrations of wealth**.. the larger the inequality! So while its generally acceptable to want to embrace new advancements i dont think you have to be a corporation shuffling big data to see whats going on. The rich are getting richer at an astronomical rate in comparison to then and now they want to automate and cut people out of the loop completely or as much as they possibly can while they prey on the last few industry's that have abundant cash flow! As of june 2013 the US GDP i think was 16 Trillion and these guys are hiding 32 trillion roughly twice the GDP of the US!! These are people with the **largest foot hold in our society**, CEO's and wall-street execs.. fortune 500 owners, politicians, bankers and what have you.

I caught my chuckle and did the best i could to not let out an epic laugh .. I responded "it was normal".. and right then i knew by the look on his face i watched a fan boy die.

Well if it was just the taxi's its one thing but what about the delivery drivers, bus drivers, limo drivers .. They all have dirty world wide special interest groups too? There will be a significant "impact" on the transportation industry and the lives and families of many many other people.  So while a one liner about some interest groups clearly wasn't enough to convince me otherwise. This report from the department of transportation gives me an idea of the impact that transportation has on the rest of the economy so i wouldn't exactly be grinning while corporations siphon and transfer wealth from everyone else.

The owner of the business said its the cost of doing business in nyc!

well generally the clipboard or the section of your computer used to remember what you copy is open and can be viewed by other programs including viruses and malware. That said if you only copy a portion of the key and remember the last or beginning 3 or 4 characters in your head then there is no way the malware or virus can pull the info from your head to complete the key stolen from your clipboard! :)

 I guess somehow the ownership concept model makes more sense to me, maybe its the audiophile in me. Streaming is as one puts it, transitory at best and lacks permanancey and thats the very thing i cant do with out. Music is personal and intimate and im not eager to give up the control knobs which determine when and how i have access to it.. Let alone let someone gauge and run analytic's on my listening interests. It really doesnt matter if that doesnt make sense to you or if you find that absurd.. i did hope you could see my perspective but we can agree to disagree. You know what they say..

The lack of support by wallets is an issue.. I setup a vps and installed bitmerchant which also uses BIP70 and the wallets i tested mostly failed. I hear multibit beta has support. Latest electrum too. All the older version of electrum and multibit dont have support tho. No support from blockchain.info either.

When I negotiate a new car purchase, I reserve (and often use) the right to walk out of the showroom... I am concerned that this is going to be a veiled one-way conversation. We talk, you listen. Sure, I am familiar with the way FAA CFRs work. NPRMs, these things are put out for public comment, and from time to time the FAA listens. But in this arena, they have no real incentive to listen to the community other than to appear to placate them.

I remember when i bought my first asic. There was a big  sign on the website that said NO REFUNDS, BITCOIN ONLY!
Big scary letters in red mind you. He was sold out in like 20-30min.
If you are leveraging the customer properly you can get them to do anything. 
If you think they are going to try something new (bitcoin) for a measly discount or just because you asked them to, think again.  That said, if you are prepared to apply continuous leverage then you will be fine.   
In other words you better be selling a digital "sword of omen" wrapped in golden silk made by a million spiders from Madagascar... If not you better be leveraging the customer with a nice discount or bundle offers.   
  
good luck

It wasnt that i couldnt find a wallet that supports BIP70.. Greenaddress for example worked right off the bat and alot of my testing was done with that.. The problem is demanding your customers use a specific wallet. Ultimately as a merchant i would like to be able to have a bitcoin shopping cart .. and not a BIP70 shopping cart. Meaning i want a majority, if not all wallets to support BIP70 so that customers who come to my site looking to pay in bitcoin can do so with their wallet of choice.
If someone sees a bitcoin address and makes a payment to it and does not get forwarded to the product they paid for it really sucks.  
Thats what was happening to me .. basically the payment would go through and i would receive it but from a customers point of view the transaction failed. Their payment was taken but they were not receiving the product or they were not being forwarded to the product page or callback url.. No graceful fallback.
That would then start a chain reaction of support emails and back and forth and pretty much turn an automated site into a customer support nightmare.  
Since BIP70 is two years old, i would think all the wallet providers would have included BIP70 by now but it seems consensus on anything, even when its something important is more difficult then i thought.
Even when there is consensus.. I also understand that not all wallet devs/providers are VC funded and everything takes man power, energy and time so it is what it is..

 Here's looking at you :   [
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:06:51
For some reason you seem to be fixated on me me me!! **Its not about you**!!! Your not saving 50% of anything by using uber and i was talking about the transferring of wealth from other industry's to a concentrated few venture capitalists. Clearly you have some bias against unskilled workers, i cant help you with that in the same way that i cant help you if you are a racist or a bigot .. that's outside of the scope of this conversation. "**Good luck with that**." Nonetheless, a huge portion of the economy is ran by unskilled workers, everything from drivers, janitors, hotel workers, painters, landscapers, construction and day laborers, waiters and restaurant staff, security guards and so on. In fact there is a considerable amount of "unskilled" workers in the economy not because they are lazy but because the pool of unskilled workers isnt just the bottom half of our economy **anymore**. Skills of years ago are no longer required because of massive technological advancements and 50% of the workforce is vulnerable to computerization. Plus you make it out to seem that unskilled workers are like 3% of the work force and the rest of you who are smart and not lazy are the rest of the work force! **Thats pretty much laughable!!**  Maybe its sounds better when yahoo finance says it.   
  
 See the first paragraph where it says "Americans are worse at math, reading and problem solving than people in **nearly two-thirds of the world’s advanced nations.**" The unskilled pool is alot bigger than you think!!!  
 The pool is getting bigger because the inequality is getting bigger and the rich are getting astronomically richer and the other half no matter what they do they cant position themselves to move up the ladder because they cant afford to or dont have the opportunity to do so by design.    
That said your gonna have to do a lot better than "unskilled workers are lazy" if you have a point to make but.. maybe you dont.

Idea wise i think its great but in terms of deployment..  
As much as i hate the idea of a centralized party like blockchain.info .. I would prefer the deployment of these merchant platforms to be less dependent on server technologies.. 
Instead of requiring people to use a specific host or a specific variant of a specific distro i would like to see something cast out with a wider net!
Something that works on any shared hosting environment .. No dependency like requiring a vpn or a dedicated server or worst yet a specific host. 
That said the api's some of these companies provide can cater to such demands but there is the whole centralization issue. Maybe if someone can create a platform that allows using multiple api's ... so the system can degrade gracefully when one api vendor is unavailable.  
I like   and blockchain.info.. 
Guess im a bit biased as i just finished working with a dev whos merchant platform required me to get a vps and install some variant of ubuntu and i spent most of my time trying to get ssl to work with the jetty server and dealing with a bunch of server administration i knew nothing about. In the end it was more of a hassle than i intended it to be and tho im no linux expert by any stretch of the imagination i have used ubuntu before in the past so i have some experience. Those without the experience are just in for a world of pain.. 
Show me something with multi api support that degrades gracefully and something that requires only shared hosting and maybe wordpress. Even that i think shortens the net a bit. Maybe something that just requires a php enabled server and thats it!
That way people can deploy it with their wordpress and jooomla or what ever they are running. Hell if they are running a server from a usb drive on a local workstation on WINDOWS it should work with that too!   
Nonetheless, good luck on your venture.

Yeah i think its a great layer of added protection. Dont get me wrong i use a hardware wallet too for my main wallet but i also use Electrum and i used circle and coinbase in the past.. plus i have small amounts of bitcoin on a couple exchanges so this app is great for times when im not using my hw wallet. 
There are a few competitors that i havent tried but ive been using keyscrambler since before they offered bitcoin wallet support so when they finally introduced wallet support i didnt even think of using something else.
 That said, here is a link to their competitors that maybe worth a look.. I cant speak for them since i have no experience with their software but here is a link.

Like this man.. 
- Seriously tho, First step is to check yourself! We live in a digital times. Safeguard whats important to you because if you dont do it nobody will.
 The repercussions to not doing so are significant. If you give the world access to your life, you will suffer the consequences and the fault will mainly rest on your shoulders.
Take facebook as an example. Use your real name do ya? What else you giving away? Do you post pictures of a cake and you blowing out the candles on the same dam day every year? Thats a great way to tell people my name is blah blah blah and my birthday is blah blah.
Then people take the same photos that you posted of you blowing candles out and find the location of your home! [Like this!](  
Then after they know where you live, they wait for you to post pictures when you are on vacation! Just by luck, you have this urge to post everything about yourself at every moment so the minute you are at the airport you are already snapping photos and live streaming from the dam airport! "Hawaii here i come" you said!  
As they are backing up the U-Haul truck in your driveway, they are thinking to themselves this can only get easier if the keys are under the doormat because.. Now they got your name, address, birthday, and since they happen to be the luckiest crooks of all time your public and private key is scribbled on a sticky note on the computer monitor along with every password and pin code for every website known to mankind!
Be conscious to the fact that there are really bad people **online or otherwise** and take appropriate action. More importantly, use preventative measure and have contingency plans in place like freezing your credit if your personal info is stolen or comprised and for the love of god stop giving away your personal information.
NOT your name, NOT your mothers maiden name, NOT your first pets name or any other name! If anyone ask for a name you tell em your name is "Mickey Mouse".. follow my drift?

Ok, looks like a vps is mandatory.. Thanks for making this, though i was really hoping for something i can use on a shared server..  I applaud your effort. 
Ive been looking at bitcoin_sci which requires nothing but a web server (works on shared server) and uses blockchain.info to poll for transaction but it too has its pitfalls. I was floored when i found bitcoin_sci since it only requires php but its not a ready to use out of the box. 
The community really needs something like what you guys are doing.   
I think its imperative that merchants can accept btc without the likes of coinbase, bitpay and to some extent blockchain.info too. We need standalone systems to flourish within the most popular setups like shared server environments running wordpress or stand alone php powered websites/apps.

What exactly is the bandwidth concern? How much data are we talking here? **50GB month? 100GB? 200gb?**   
People post these fanless boxes but never mention anything related to how much bandwidth these things suck up monthly! I have a data cap to deal with so... running one of these from the house may not be a good bet. 
The above said, who wants to bust out some bandwidth stats for running a full node? I heard it has something to do with how many connections you allow? Maybe someone with experience can elaborate.. If someone can break down how many connections net you x amount of bandwidth that would be great.

I have questions. 
**1)** Bitseed is sold with the option of buying different size drives with it or an ssd. How big is the blockcahin now and how long will a 1tb drive last? Will i have to upgrade the drive in a year or two? 
**2)** what type of maintenance is required? How easy is it to upgrade to 13.3 or whatever the next core version is when it comes out? Also if and when the drive has to be replaced, be it to upgrade to a larger size or to upgrade to an SSD.. What is the procedure like in terms of getting up and running again. Do you have to follow some cryptic guide or can your grandma do it?
**3)** I have bandwidth limitations and i need to limit connections or set a daily upload limit. Can this be easily done from the web interface?
**4)** If one has "multiple" commercial storefronts with bitcoin powered shopping carts, is this product suitable to verify payments as they come in?

I figured by now they would go full retard and be charging to see your account balance.  
  
Wanna see your balance? "That will be 1$!"
2 minutes later.. you get an email..
Dear Member,
It seems you have hit your daily limit for checking your account balance and your account has been locked. To unlock it and check your balance now.  "That will be 1$."
10 seconds later..
"For security reasons your session has expired and you will need to re-login." As of Jan 1 2016 if you would like to re-login to an account that was previously logged into less than 60 minutes ago..   "That will be 1$."
Find that to be a sudden shock? Our terms and conditions are constantly changing so check back here often to wade through this material and since its 79000 pages, if you would like to sign up for our terms and conditions newsletter that highlights all our new terms and conditions.. "That will be 1$."
Thank you for being such a loyal customer. We appreciate your money and have no intentions of giving it back. We will use it to ad new "features" like our hidden fees program that will be deployed to all accounts later this month. After January 30 2016, to remove clutter and to improve the workflow of your account details page, we will no longer display the fees we charge as part of your account details page. If you would like to enable our new "show fees" feature. That will be 1$."

Say no to restaurants. Real Estate has a boom and bust cycle too similar to bitcoin. My aunt did really well during the 2008 housing crash. When $hit hit the fan she was cash heavy so she pounced on a townhouse in Cali for 54k and 7 or 8 years later she sold it for $388k. 
She then moved to Ohio and bought a 3 bed 2 bath 1800sqft house for 150k and also bought a duplex for 50k in Ohio as well that she rents out. She got in at a really great time. Funny enough she always asks me if she should buy bitcoin and when. She tells me she thinks about that often.
I suppose you need to ask yourself where am i? If you have a real estate cycle map that says ["you are here"]( that would help a lot. Im biased regarding bitcoin as i rode in on the ship. There is a saying where im from that says..


Well, i rode in on bitcoin so thats how im riding out. Clearly im biased in favor of bitcoin but its young and its rekless and threatening to disrupt a lot of $hit. Ive been here for a [long time]( and i have no plans on leaving or exiting but sometimes i day dream of buying real estate just like my aunt dreams of buying bitcoin.

Ive always wanted to get a trezor but i have never got around to it. I have bought 10+ ledger devices for family and friends and the good folks at ledger have always taken care of me.  
  
 One time i bought a ledger and they emailed me saying that the shipment took a lil longer then expected.. then they asked for my btc address so they can refund me partially for the shipping! 
WTF!! LOL..  I knew right then and there that i would be a ledger customer for the long haul. The above said i recently had interest in the Trezor one cause of a certain altcoin that just got Trezor support but i found the Trezor one was just too expensive in contrast to the ledger nano s. 
Ill probably revisit getting a Trezor during the holidays when i load up on hardware wallets for presents.   
  
At the end of the day im pretty happy with ledger and the only reason ill get a Trezor is so i can support Slush. Trezor has been holding it down for us for a long time and they deserve our support as does Ledger!

Hello there, I am in the US and here we have to pay taxes every time we spend bitcoins. Its basically a taxable event so you have to keep track of how much you cashed out or spent/sent. That being said.. if there was a way to export the history of your transactions that would be great.

 Maybe something that shows arbitrage opportunity between pairs of exchanges over long or short periods of time. Lets say some random exchange in India has a 100 dollars price difference then say coinbase. It would be great to see a historical graph of said arbitrage opportunity.   
Basically it would have to be setup in a way where you can select "two exchanges" maybe with checkbox from a list of exchanges and then not only view the current arbitrage opportunity from those two exchanges but also a historical data on arbitrage opportunity from the select pair of exchanges. 
In my example i said some random exchange in India and Coinbase so using that example the app would be able to tell me what the arbitrage opportunity was between those exchanges a week ago, two days ago or a year ago..

Have you seen the worlds currency visualized? Bitcoin is that first lil dot. Scroll down a bit to see gold. It would be really great to see some of that gold money leak into bitcoin and the 1 btc price going over the 1 ounce gold price maybe a pivot moment. Lots of investors are going to take another look at bitcoin and that may mean we have to purchase zero gravity boots if that happens sooner then later.

Got a couple questions..
Is the Btcpayserver limited in anyway running on the Casa node 2? 
For example is there a limit on the amount of stores that can be created/powered? ( Example: If i have 6 businesses and i would like to accept btc and lightning using the Casa Node 2 for those businesses is this possible? )
 
Can i add alts like LTC or is there a hardware limit to how many alts can be added?
Given the above.. How much monthly bandwidth do Casa Node 2's require to run?
Last but not least do you have a planned hardware cycle.. meaning how often do you plan on releasing new hardware versions?
EDIT: Would only like to add ltc to btcpayserver

See the squiggly white line on the rainbow? Follow it to the right until the end. (**you are here**)
The colors are supposed to represent the zone you are in. If the white squiggly line is at the dark blue zone at the bottom the of the rainbow then sell everything you own and buy btc!
Currently we are in between the blue and light blue area. Dollar cost average and buy regularly.. Welcome to the accumulation zone.
If the white squiggly line gets in the purple area at the top of the rainbow that means bitcoin is rampaging and going nuts.. you should consider moving 30-50% of your btc into a stable coin and wait for a correction so you can buy back in and accumulate moarr btc.
Im sure you can interpret the rest of the colors based on the above.
( This is not financial advice, lol. This is just my interpretation of this chart. )

Without the support of the wallet providers it means nothing if the merchants implement BIP70.

No doubt.. Im just really protective of my coins and its a responsibility that i dont take lightly. Measures that you have taken like turning off the wifi can be undone if you dont pay attention to the feature set of your handset or OS.   
For example this feature of automatically turning on WIFI if you are near a "high quality" home or public network that showed up with the release of oreo might put you in a bad position if you have that feature enabled. I dont think its enabled by default but dont quote me on that.. at least on Oreo. If you have a rooted phone with some random rom this feature might be enabled. Hell it might even be enabled by default on newer variants of android like " Android 9.0 Pie"..
 
That said, even with wifi off, having the phone in your possession and driving by your job or some other trusted network may toggle the wifi "on" exposing your coins to hidden malware on your handset that it may have been shipped with from the factory.

Thanks for the reply, Im using blockchain.info and their api. I plan on selling items that are unique to the user like a software license.. Naturally im worried about fraud. Initially i was just going to make everyone wait the one confirmation but maybe allow repeat customers to purchase with zero confirmations.. I didnt realize how improbable it was until reading your comment. Do you by chance know If there is a way to poll network propagation for a given transaction in real time using the blockchain.info api or otherwise?

BIP70 is a couple years old now right?.. Why are wallet providers slacking in implementing.. i tried a bunch that just didnt work including multibit and electrum, blockchain.info...  
  
Really popular wallets that have just not opted to add the support. Glad to see there is a beta out for multibit with support for it tho.  
Great stuff comes along like BITID and BIP70 and it just stalls cause wallet providers are slacking.

So what would you say the magic number is in terms of value vs wanted confirmation. If you were a merchant and you were selling items ranging from $5-$100... What is the cutoff line for items with 0 confirmation. 
You said a coffee not worth the trouble so $5 dollar items can use 0 confirmation. What about $20 items? How close does one get to the $100 before asking a confirmation or two confirmations?
Is there a consensus on these things or a standard of sorts or is it just based on what the merchant is willing to risk or not based on the value of the item?

Buyer protection and regulations.. haha. Fuck a bank! 
  
Oh and here is a thought... with bitcoin you dont have to put everything you own in one account! You are your own bank. You can have 500 accounts if you want.   
 
You can use a multisig wallet for accounts with large amounts and have a bunch of hot wallets for daily spending. If you choose to be careless or you like posting your pin or private key along with the rest of your life on facebook then go ahead and post your keys to your hot wallets on social media so you can have someone or something to blame cause it sounds like to me you need something to blame other then yourself Mister ( "when "i" lose my card (pin/access code) "
As for the regulations and buyer protections.. why the fuck have banks been fined 243 BILLION since the the financial crisis if banks are so great.

You know ive been looking for a standalone solution for a merchant platform without having to depend on the likes of coinbase and bitpay and i found a pretty good solution in "Bitmerchant" but its dependent on bip70 to work properly ...

Im not sure its a good solution at all but Its actually not ridiculous that FATCA exist! The people with the biggest foothold in the US are hiding 32 Trillion offshore &amp; tax free! At the time of the writing of these articles, i think the GDP for the US was around 16 Trillion! So these fools are hiding twice the GDP of the entire US offshore! When they started going after the money like when the Swiss went south, they would just convert it into art like a real life shapeshift.io! Then they would take said art and toss it in a freeport tax free!

Its none of your business how i manage my private keys. Its my responsibility that i will not pass over to anyone else. In terms of how many places accept bitcoin.. its irrelavent to the topic at hand but you know that.  
 I do agree with you in that you are not alone in being a careless fuck. I look at people who are posting pitcures of themsevles on social media all the time: "hey guys im at the airport going on vaction, look at me!" Then when they arrive home from vaction and realize they have been robbed of everything they own they go on a rampage looking for someone to blame! Anyway to shift the responsibility to anyone or anything but themselves..   
"Its the door lock manufacturers fault, No its the alarm company's fault they should pay for all my things, No its my neighbors fault, No the citys fault there wasnt enough patrols, No its the ...
Please..  take some fucking responsibility. Not only for your personal info but for your finances and your health or anything else. There is a culture of passing on responsibility and not being accountable and when shit hits then fan people look to pass the blame on to anything but themselves. 
PS: Since you careless fucks are taggin your mom on social media and her maiden name visible in plain fucking sight it doesnt take a scientist to break into your bank account hence the reason you want recourse! How about taking some responsibility.

There is no defacto bitcoin shopping cart that merchants can use that doesnt have the burden of bitcoind. I wish there was something light-weight that worked with api's like blockchain.info's or better yet some sort of decentralized solution to be able to query the blockchain so merchants can know when they have been paid so they can ship product immediately.   
  
Something that doesnt take a percentage of each one of your transactions! Something free and open source. We have Electrum for a light weight wallet and it rocks! Where is our light weight shopping cart solution? Wordpress plugin maybe? Something that works on a shared server so you dont have to get a vps. When its all said and done i wish i had something bitcoin powered that had coupon codes and automatic shipping rate calculation and buy 1 get one free system and so forth but right now i would take anything have way decent.

Ive gotta say .. for a bunch of people who want bitcoin to succeed, there are not to many people in the community willing to put in the time to make tutorials and help others along! I have found one resource that has been amazing and its simply because the guy is passionate about teaching others! I have donated via change tip a few times but im sure i will be donating more as this guy deserves  it in every sense of the word! 
We need more people like this, willing to put in the time and nudge people in the right direction. What i like about this the most is that he is saying what he is thinking the whole time. Hes not just pointing you to git and saying figure it out. He walks you through the process and tells you how it all works as hes going along. Good Stuff.  Here is the link, Enjoy the channel.

Dont take this the wrong way man but .. I dont think you understand what has happened here. This has nothing to do with bitcoin, reddit accounts, gambling, laws, fucking up, being right/wrong, or anything else like that. What has happened here is that you have become a clown until you pay this man back. 
You being a clown is "initially" not visible to anybody else. Its something you will carry with you until you de-clown yourself and there is only one way to do that.. Switching outfits, reddit accounts, computers or ISP's wont change that.
Somehow your psyche allows you to negate what is happening and you are proclaiming to the world you will be a clown forever and you publicly admit to being the type of person that betrays peoples trust. Look up the word traitor and see how its defined. 


Doubt is the ultimate treason against faith and your faith in yourself will forever be tarnished until you pay your debt, even if you dont realize it. 
As time goes on, your internal character will harden and take form and you will be under the impression that people "dont know" you are a clown but the reality is that the people around you will know exactly who you are becasue you will unintentionally broadcast it like a beacon wherever you go.
The most hilarious part of your post is that you are signing off like a comedian or a clown does at the end of every show .. (rofl)
"be honorable. Don't scam people and don't promise" ( signing off now)  wtf.. and then you dare tell people to HODL! Whoever u/YusafIslamEfud is.. would be hodling if it wasnt for you!
Ok.. ive said too much. If i can leave you with anything.. its that maybe you should consider trying to pay him back slowly. He might even let you off the hook if you remotely attempted to pay him back!( aka de-clown yourself)
 Something to think about..( btw, you passed up pathetic a hundred miles back grinning like a mental patient )

@_date: 2013-07-07 21:32:17
yawns.. why would the people with the largest of footholds in our society move their money! There is no clamping down! You think 32 trillion got there over night? Ceo's, Judges, lawyers, venture capitalists and the rest of the kardashians have zero incentive to get their bitcoin on! 
They have America by the balls and they are laughing at us!

**micro trading**  Stop the bots and the micro shuffle. Its used to ensue panic !! **we know you love the panics because you profit from it!** Enough is enough!! **Do something about the bots** Filter them or charge for trading above abnormal amounts of trades from same account!! DO SOMETHING!~

Get the malware off youre pc! Pluck out all the bad browser helper objects ..Use a vm! Use a live disk if you have too! Purchase keyscrambler if your running windows! Use lastpass! Install antivirus &amp; anti malware like malwarebytes! Use sandboxIE! Install a 2-way firewall! Turn on 2 factor! Do your windows updates! Update all your plugins like java and flash! Have someone harden your system.
None of the above alone works! But together...  Separate youre work flow from play.. Use different computers or take the steps above! Dont share youre pc with other people! They are called personal computers for a reason! I have a services overhauling pc's and its so frustrating when i see people with no antivirus, or protection of any kind running xp with service pack one and the computer is riddled with spyware and viruses! This stuff can be avoided if you take precautions.

I got so fekd, Twice!! Lost $250 :( missed legendary miner! and missed out on the epic jump this week in BTC..  I Have a lil under $6k sitting somewhere in some trading platform now in USD..   :( Broken heart, im limping into the sunset alone. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:48:41
Thanks for even offering buy the way!
@_date: 2013-08-08 04:19:43
Lets hope they come thru in the end here, There are lots of people depending on them. I wonder why the silent treatment. If they ran with the loot i would be in shock! I dont think thats the case.. Hopefully there is not anything major going on.. The silence is deafening tho. Ironically everytime if tried to contact yufi he has answered right away! lol.. Im not a customer tho so maybe he was being polite. I can imagine customers buggin the **** out of him.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:25:55
LOL, made my day!!
@_date: 2013-08-22 06:47:13
Whats Wrong with people! Stop doing business with them!!!! Your being had!!
@_date: 2013-04-07 02:47:48
Its like $5 higher! Kinda sucks.. i liked bitfloor, if they were two maybe three $ bucks off no problem!! BUT 5$!! Really.. looking for alternatives.. Will end up at bitstamp. Or maybe when mtgox finishes the 30day verification with my **ssn , drivers licence, medical insurance papers a picture of me fucking my ex and a piece of shit from my dog** and everything else they need to do a simple verification that even ridiculously incapable companys like paypal can do via dropping a few cents in the account! Maybe then !!! MAYBE.. after they have everything they need.. then add 20 days of watching the BTC rise while they verify how ridiculous they are being .. then add another 20 days to send them funds! Oh wait.. what was i doing again!! Oh yeah something about finding a halfway decent company to trade on their floor!  Fek !!

You mean the max 5-15cents per transaction? Its not to bad.. But the few stores ive helped setup have under 100 items or less so maybe its hasnt been an impact for us to notice.
