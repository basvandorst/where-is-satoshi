This is like using gold to buy coffee. Bitcoin isn’t ideal for small transactions, it’s good for holding. The solution is for retailers to accept for more alts like litecoin.

Because bitcoin wasn’t designed to handle the volume it has today and simply believing in something doesn’t make it true.

Why is that? I’ve always heard of the 4% rule.

Eh, I somewhat disagree with you here. I work in retail and when we started accepting Apple Pay I noticed a bunch of people start using it, about on par with android pay. Mobile phone payments are still pretty new in the US and I think the more options there are the better.

Not when it concerns the IRS... Keep records

Keep your coins in cold storage. Exchanges are for exchanging, not storing.

No, he needs advice on both. 
You’re free to provide info about hardening without misleading OP into thinking immediately moving coins to a paper or other offline wallet is not necessary. You don’t own your coins unless you own the private keys to the wallet they’re in. You’re trying to make an argument against what is generally accepted as the most secure form of coin storage and I don’t understand it.

I’m not sure what your point is. OP asked how to prevent this. The answer is cold storage. You do your trading then move your coins out of the exchange immediately. I never implied what you’re arguing against.
