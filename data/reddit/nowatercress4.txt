If you're so smart, why is it so difficult for you to defend (or even explain) your own comments? A rational and mature reaction to debate is to explain your side of the argument, rather than defaulting to the "why should I waste my time" excuse. This does nothing but prove my point that you actually have no clue what you're arguing, but think you can get away with throwing out pseudo intellectual jargon.
I mean do you really believe Warren Buffett has no clue why money is valuable?

I would love to hear more about monetary economics and how Buffet is ignorant. Please go on wise one who posts in the_donald.

Every single expense you have accepts bitcoin? Seems incredible unlikely, if not impossible.

Sounds like you did something wrong

Yeah, Europe totally doesn’t have a toxic political environment that gave a voice to people like Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen. Sure we have a total buffoon as a president, but a politically toxic environment is not unique to America.

It's hard to believe, isn't it?

What does account age have to do with anything? Or do you consider it some indicator of knowledge? You probably think Reddit gold is an honor.

Good god, you really can’t defend your point, can you? You can’t even scramble together a  google search of Warren Buffett and monetary economics to try to make something up, because you are legitimately just regurgitating things you’ve heard other people say in hopes of sounding enlightened. 
I’ve given you so many opportunities to make me look ignorant or dumb but you don’t even possess the smallest kernel of knowledge to do it. Instead you resort to insults and the assumption that even if you did explain it that I wouldn’t understand (which, of course, is the most transparent strategy when you actually are clueless). 
The only thing that is ignorant is expressing a belief and being unwilling (or in your case intellectually unable) to explain it with words.

Nope...can't have a dissenting opinion about bitcoin here. Otherwise you're:
1. old
2. stupid
3. scared
4. all of the above

Mr. Ztsmart, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this sub is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Can you explain exactly how banks create money out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:30:44
Typical backtrack by someone who doesn't actually have any insight and is just regurgitating buzz words that they have absolutely no ability to defend. 
But I guess you're probably used to sounding uninformed.

It’s irrelevant only because it doesn’t support the views of the people in here. This is much more an echo chamber than it is a place to discuss bitcoin in any constructively critical way. 
It’s a shame too, because whether Buffett is right or not, he’s a smart guy, and any discussion about bitcoin could be something that helps rather than hurt it. But the people in here would much rather call him names and post article after article of some random person predicting what price bitcoin “could” hit.

I don't totally disagree, but I find almost no tangible evidence that Bitcoin is having a substantial effect on the big banks, American ones in particular. So I think the notion that bitcoin is eating their lunch is unfounded at this point.
I also think bitcoin supporters vastly overestimate how many people actually want or need to use it. The bitcoin community strikes me as a very isolated one, and I think it's inability to view opinion from outside what has become an echo chamber severely affects its ability to remain pragmatic. 
Bitcoin is essentially promoted as a monetary revolution. But is there really enough people to join in this revolution to make it anything more than a fringe payment system? I'll guess I will believe it when I see it.

I can assure you that I am not the person who wrote the Vanguard article. That dude would not waste his time posting his own article to reddit. I on the other hand I have nothing better to do at the moment. Though I guess I probably won’t convince you of that. But that’s okay.

How is Square surpassing Venmo when it has less users?
Also, this whole article seems to suggest that Square's stock price was a result of bitcoin integration. No fucking way. Correlation does not imply causation.

If in fact this sub is a good sample of the larger bitcoin community, I think it serves as a pretty good indicator of where bitcoin is going to end up in the future. Hint: the story doesn't end with lambos.

Lol. “Why should I?” How old are you? Well if you don’t want to explain your brilliant economic theories can you  at least send me an I told you so message when bitcoin supplants the worlds currency. I’ll be waiting patiently

Why does this only show its % below 10k and not 1m?
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:32:09
Just because it doesn’t support your own beliefs doesn’t make it a bad analogy. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:54:51
Lol. Love how there is a rationalization for every bitcoin dip as if past events are a 100% predictor of the future.
