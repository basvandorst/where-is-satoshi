I ordered on a Monday, they said they would deliver Friday, and it got cancelled an hour before I was supposed to get it on Friday.  I don't think there's an algorithm, they just cancel all orders from new users since a scammer is unlikely to complain.  I emailed them, got an automated response right away.  I emailed again on Tuesday, got an automated reply to be patient.  On Thursday morning I got an email saying they reviewed my order, it would be filled a the original price and I would be whitelisted for future orders.  They filled the order 11 hours later at the original price from the Monday before.  
It's pretty nerve racking with all the waiting and uncertainty, but they eventually come through.

"Unfortunately, we have decided to cancel this order because it appears to be high risk".  Make sure to email them every two days and you'll eventually get it at original price.

If I backup to a wallet.dat file, then send(or receive) some bitcoin, is the old file completely worthless or could it still be used to get my private key?

Wouldn't the transaction fee make this unfeasible?

If you like this idea check out the book [Ready Player One by Ernest Cline](   I think you would like it.

You don't see it in pounds either.

Didn't your Datek account get converted into a TDAmeritrade account?
