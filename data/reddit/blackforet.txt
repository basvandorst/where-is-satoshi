We are roughly at a 30% correction now.. yes it’s gone a bit further than expected but in the bigger picture it doesn’t make a big difference I think. Could even go to low 9000 now - I like this healthy correction to regain strength 
From a day trading perspective one should have sold at the high 13’s but I rather cold storage hold for several reasons (taxation is one of them)

He definitely gave up the scam by saying ‘with ease’ ��
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:52:04
I obviously agree with this truth, but this was not the point of my original intent.. anyways
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:41:34
Ok He‘s purely tech though -  price &amp; speculation is still &amp; will be a vital part of the space
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:48:01
Maybe the worst is behind us now - let’s see..
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:56:32
���� - yeah not sure.. imo the charts do their thing regardless
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:25:20
Fun fact: this might well could have been the last sub 10k Bitcoin ever...

Looks like the futures got included 
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:32:41
How harsh is that ����
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:25:36
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:42:17
Thanks Theodore - you are magic
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:11:44
Still here though?
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:03:13
Ah i get it ��
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:04:02
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:02:46
And the solace is?
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:09:17
It took me 14 hours on Binance - they do it properly with required selfie etc.. and then got approved the next day
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:29:45
How long (or should I say short) do you expect this bull market to take
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:11:49
Pls do ����
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:09:19
Good point! Now vanish
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:28:31
No shit ����
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:52:16
Thx! Puh these random breakouts are to be enjoyed with care these days, do you agree?
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:54:02
Which of the remaining 20% do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:00:40
You’ll be just fine.. only Focus on resisting to sell when it’s down temporarily - that would be really bad
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:40:30
Calm down
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:04:31
My stand exactly... btw how do you feel about the fact that this current chart movement rhymes with the last cycle to the T - only that it took 6 months instead of 18.. i think OTC‘s are running low on coins to sell and the ‚Institutional‘ bubble could potentially blow this thing up quickly
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:41:32
That’s clear - just looking at it from the angle that exchanges would have to gather info from whom one receives crypto - so when receiving from your own Ledger cold storage how does that go? Or am i completely wrong on this one?!?
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:00:59
That’s the thing - if this keeps going at the current speed it would peak out after a third of the time span. Last cycle it took 32 months to go from bottom to peak in Dec 17.  Having said that it would only take until give or take Q1 '20 which is crazy - that’s why I keep looking for different takes on this. I rather have it take time to the actually expected mid '21
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:47:45
Funny enough the majority of speculators (who do essentially drive the price) don’t go into actual detail like you have (brilliant info thx) so it’s more of a hype effect causing trading action.
Good point as to how much of the ‚pricing in’ will happen within the next 10-12 months
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:01:33
Pff I think that be insane - but def quicker than last - could be end of 2020?
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:38:31
Yes on par - we are about to bottom out for this correction (maybe 10.4 the lowest max) then slow(er) recovery going to around 18k before the next dip back down to around 14.5
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:56:27
For starters, Congrats for not selling when you were down.. not easy... 
First you need to suffer, then you get rewarded. The laws of life apply to crypto perfectly
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:40:36
Unless the exchange is dodgy or about to go bust you’ll be fine
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:30:42
Thanks for this general overview bro - been in the ‚game‘ since early '17 and do spend a decent amount of time daily on the space. Was hoping to have a more advanced conversation with you. 
I find it interesting how the charts rhyme to the previous cycle to the T - and it keeps doing it and doing it and doing it.. it’s almost too good to be true. Only thing that strikes me is the time factor - it seems to move 3 times as fast this time since the last time it took 18 months to get from bottom to status quo - now only 6 months
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:08:58
He‘s the one who made it - think about it ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:41:56
That’s why I gave you this reply
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:09:09
I do live and see what happens.. the intent was to get opinions on the speed this current chart performance.. It’s relevant for me regarding tax components in my country - I rather have it take time! Maybe the wording mislead that
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:46:01
Ok thx man - this would def defy the 100k by EOY theory though. Much more reasonable..
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:11:17
Serious? Did it on mobile can’t get it clearer. But then again it’s not about the prettiness is it
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:50:11
Poor you.. no one gets the joke.. or maybe it’s just not so funny
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:37:38
As applied to a lot of things in life overthinking can shut doors.. just do it and thank yourself in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:20:21
If you boil it down to psychology or human behavior patterns mixed in with whale tactics it doesn’t seem so wild anymore in my opinion. Yeah the volume isn’t it
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:00:06
You’re not giving up I give you that.. relevant comparison too �� By the way this discussion is about timing and you made your point thx
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:33:14
Does this for instance mean Ledger will have to introduce KYC?
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:41:40
Exactly thanks ����

@_date: 2018-03-04 13:24:05
The future is here
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:13:03
But he meant the reasons 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:00:50
cash, gold or both
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:14:32
it takes pre-organizing similar to how traditional inheritance settlements are organized pre death. Private Keys need to be made accessible just like bank accounts or asset ownerships 
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:06:40
Huh?? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:27:19
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:48:31
They are there it’s just a displaying issue 
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:26:54
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:07:09
Go in more detail about your situation for a start
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:08:45
You answered it yourself.. fast moving progress in 18 Months
