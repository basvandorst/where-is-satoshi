yeah man. i’ve learned to not wait on anything anymore. I’m investing what I CAN afford to lose. So if it goes up, good. If it goes down, oh well.

Buy high, sell low!

you lost me at 'in my opinion' ��
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:08:03
Then get to reading ya bum. If you're really in it to just hold, what your asking is irrelevant. Why care if you're gonna 'hold for the longest time possible.'
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:53:05
scroll. read. get informed. quit bein lazy. ��

i truly suggest you do your research. Or better yet, just scroll. This question got asked so many times people are just starting to troll every new post about this.
