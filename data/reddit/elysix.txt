Different markets having different prices
(and/or the websites using different formulas to calculate some average price)

Well yeah. And the indoctrination and force is still alive and well. So the us dollar is backed and healthy.

Not the us, but a friend of mine actually put "for cocaine and hookers" or something similar in the comment line for a transaction to settle a debt for something else with another friend, and the recipient apparently got a very serious talking to by the bank to not have that happen again.

By skewing the exchange rates to their favour like every other company providing the service of exchanging currencies?

That doesnt factor in difficulty adjustment though. If mining rigs get better or more people mine then everyone has to mine harder, using more power. Watts/block is what matters, not watts/hash. Or better yet, watts/transaction.

I dont think the number of bitcoins doubling will last for much longer than until 51% decide for one side... the other half will quickly become worthless... i dont see the big players accepting bitcoin from the 2 chains simultaneously

It is an answer though. There is no reason to suspect them having a drastically different business modell than everyone else before them in the same niche. Its how standard currency exchanges operate, its how previous bitcoin ATMs operate.
Are you waiting for an employee of them to explain themselves?

Doesnt that make it extremely easy to doctor your books?
"No its fine that we didnt pay tax on any of that,it was all bought by foreigners..."

But there is no obvious difference between me sending bitcoin from one adress to the next and me paying someone for something. If that person then gambles with that money, i havent broken any laws, the other person has.

Its there so that the camera knows its a qr code and how tilted it is and which way around it is supposed to be if you dont take the picture perfectly straight.

Well if he really was satoshi, then he would be extremly rich and wielding considerable power over the bitcoin market. That made him a target, not only for people out for his money but also people whose money would be threatened by him and his bitcoins being anything but dormant.

The "pyramid" in pyramid scheme is not about hierarchy of authority, or who is subordinate to whom, its about how the money flows.
In a pyramid scheme the money flows from one layer to the next, with each one getting a bigger cut than the last, and the bottom-most layer getting nothing or even being in the red.
In a regular job, all the money flows directly to the top, and then part of that money flows down to all layers.
Difference being that as opposed to the pyramid scheme where you are fucked if you happen to be in the last layer before the thing keels over/before no profitability is left, (and you cant know for sure, they certainly wont tell you), and you are indebted to your boss, in a normal job you know youll get paid and you are not indebted to anyone.

If we go with your weird definition of "backed", then fiat is backed by police forces and armies.

There may be a few hickups but eventually it will get profitable again after enough miners drop out

With a fake identity and all? Wouldnt call that simple. And what are you going to buy? And how? 
If its illegal then very few if any shops will offer to accept it as payment, especially since they would have to launder it afterwards, and amazon and the like wouldnt ever try.
That leaves you with importing everything you want to buy, or going with the black market. Which is kind of noticeable from the outside, especially if you are not spending any normal money on it.
