Sure but it doesn't make sense to spend $30+ to send $10 to somebody. Or worse, I need to consolidate a wallet with many addresses and right now it would cost over $2000 in transaction fees just to send my money to myself.  It's broken.

Can you not see the price in bitcoins without completing the checkout process? I mean what exchange rate are they using. This is very important for something as incredibly volatile as BTC. I don't I even know if I have enough coin.

when you use purse.io do you still get Amazon return/exchange ability if the product is defective? What about manufacturer warranty? Seems kind of funky.

It's unclear why they even need to do this. Bank transactions are already tracked so if you moved money from coinbase to a bank or the other direction then it is already tracked. There is no other way to move money in or out of coinbase so yeah, I don't get why they need to pull all the coinbase records unless they think coinbase themselves are doing something wrong (which again, their bank transactions are already tracked!).

The client is fucked up. This is the life you get when you depend on idiots managing the software for your finances.
