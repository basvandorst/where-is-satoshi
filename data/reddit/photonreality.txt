I expected more from Trezor T but it only offers touchscreen and a slightly faster 2$ CPU.
If you are looking for a company who focuses on security you should check out [AsicVault](
Instead of performing just 2,000 rounds of HMAC-SHA512 on your seed words to derive the keys, it performs 2,0000,000 rounds! That is one thousand times more. 
Slow microcontrollers inside Trezor 1/T simply can't do any better. Trezor T is just 1.4x faster than Trezor 1, that doesn't help.

16384 is probably the default for PBKDF2, but this would make wake-up too slow..."
Guess what, AsicVault also makes you paper backups 1000 times harder to crack! These are real security benefits.
It has aluminum case, built like a real vault. Multiple layers of active and passive anti-tamper features. PUF encrypted keys and much more.
