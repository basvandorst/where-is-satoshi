It’s sad that MDMA research has been shuttered for decades when we knew decades ago its potential for therapeutic usage.

Make no mistake, tipping your waitstaff with bitcoin would make you an asshole. The likelihood that they have BTC, the knowledge, the address... we all know it’s not popular with everyone. Give cash.

��You talked to the founder of bitcoin?

�� Dude quotes DJT talking points, says I’m overwhelmed with propaganda. Back to the cave.
What you admire is a place you’ve never lived and know nothing about.

The government isn’t inefficient, we keep electing people who specifically don’t want it to operate.

Yeah same thing for that Einstein guy, fucking genius socialist!

This comment is an example of someone who knows nothing about politics, sharing their opinion. I’m laughing so hard that you don’t even know what “Star Wars” was.

The economy is great for who? Not any of us.
Sources Mises, a joke of a source. Might as well read tea leaves.

You sound like you listen to the moron in chief to much.
No one cares about GDP or unemployment alone, jobs pay less, people are in more debt. Holy shit record unemployment for Latinos and blacks? Fuck off with your trump talking points troll. That’s great that in Serbia or Russia they’ve given you nice scripts about how great America is, I mean in comparison to Russia; mobility is a fucking lie; the only way anyone’s going is down right now.

Systemic racism exists. It’s not bullshit. As a white man its next to impossible for me to be affected by systemic racism. I won’t be looked over for having a foreign sounding name for instance.
That doesn’t mean that classical racism doesn’t exist.

The only people who use the word SJW now are regressive douchebags on the internet.

Systemic racism? No.
Normal racism sure... someone can call me a cracker or hate me cause I’m white.. I don’t run into that shit though..
