only if you want to get tainted coins, shady people, cant sell on other exchanges but go to bisq as they have no chain analysis or ways of detecting colored coins

I think the cards are much easier for underbanked folks. Getting Bitcoin requires formal banking most of the time. There is definitely potential for bad stuff as well and I did my best in addressing that in the article. Very hard to estimate proportion of each.

well thats just dumb, your platform must be full of people using compromised bank accounts to pay for btc.
if i do not know the person i am trading with how can i ever have any idea they are paying from their own account or im not the unwitting recipient of some MITM/forex scam deposit.
you make your users patsys for money laundering and crime

ok and i have done this and got "gtfo you are buying from me not vice versa"
nobody selling on bisq will share their identity as most people are trying to launder stolen ico scam coins that other exchanges wont touch

localbitcoins is dying.
their volume is all moving to paxful 
@_date: 2019-12-11 12:33:38
they would have the most high cost of making payments overnight :D

If you are LocalBitcoins, yes, ... 5AMLD caused a freak out.&gt; 
yea Paxful is profiting bigly from LBC being unlucky enough to be in the EU and under 5AMLD jurisdiction.
for paxful users can just create a new account and buy up to 1500 with no verification so more or less they are eating up their customers now

How are prople managing to trade on LBC when the exchange now requires KYC for even a 1 dollar trade.
do people in Venezuela all have passport and documents to KYC and are they not afraid of repercussions since i thought bitcoin is not really allowed officially?
