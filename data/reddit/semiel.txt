It's pretty clear at this point that Wright wants people to think he's (part of) Satoshi. Whether that's because it's true, or for some other reason, is less clear.

Are you referring to Counterparty-style systems built on top of Bitcoin? If yes, then I agree that that's a definite possibility. But that doesn't really get the same network effects as Bitcoin proper, as you need people to switch to using Counterparty nodes and to get access to some XCP. I'm also curious about what would happen to things like mining in a future where 99% of transactions were in XCP, and Bitcoin was only used for backing the network.
If you're referring to smart contracts somehow using plain Bitcoin, then I'd be curious to see any work that's been done on how to make that possible. I'm under the impression it would require fairly serious additions to the protocol.

I agree there is a pretty different approach. Ethereum raised a lot of money to build an entire system themselves. CIYAM just built an MVP, and now is letting the rest of the world build the necessary tools on top of it. Both are perfectly valid models, and it will be interesting to see what different paths these differences cause them to take. 
The part I disagree with is claiming that Ethereum didn't have "much to show" when they did the crowdsale. They were already on their fifth PoC release by the start of the crowdsale. That's the release IBM is using in their project. It had (earlier versions of) all of the features I listed before, with the exception of the fast block times.
Anyway, this is arguably off-topic in a thread about AT, so I'll stop here. I just get annoyed when falsehoods get traction, as this one seems to be.

They seem to be well-intentioned, and completely technically incompetent. Whether you see them as a good company depends on which side you find more important.

No, that's also the wrong priority. As long as Bitcoin is something you "buy", it cannot succeed. Daily-use currencies aren't "bought", they're earned through wages. 
The priority is for people to get _paid_ in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, there's not currently much reason why employees would want that.

It would be a very bad thing for Bitcoin if it were as good as WU right now. That probably sounds crazy, so bear with me while I explain. 
There's a famous book called _The Innovator's Dilemma_ which introduces the concept of "disruption". Like most subtle and technical concepts, disruption has been warped by pop culture to mean almost the opposite of its original idea. 
In the original formulation, the key aspect of a disruptive technology is that it is _worse_ than the incumbent technologies. An innovation that makes something _better_ would be merely a "sustaining" innovation, which the incumbent companies will coopt and use for their own benefit. We have a prejudice that big companies cannot grasp new technologies, but the history doesn't bear that out. Big companies are extremely good at using their giant piles of cash to do anything that will be better for their sales, including adopting new technology. 
Instead, the way disruption happens is that a new technology is invented that is worse than existing technologies. It's slower, more expensive, less efficient. But because no two technologies have exactly the same properties, there are some quirks that make the technology interesting for _new_ use cases that the old technology couldn't cover. Eventually, the new market might grow to eclipse the original. 
An example: personal computers were worse in every way than minicomputers. They were slower, more expensive per cpu, and more expensive per MB of storage. They couldn't run any of the existing software, and weren't powerful enough to be shared by multiple people. Businesses that sold minicomputers to other businesses had absolutely no interest in personal computers. 
But, they had the interesting property of being small, and cheap-per-unit (even if more inefficient). This was not at all useful for existing customers, who had plenty of space and cared about efficiency rather than unit cost. But it meant that a small group of hobbyists were interested in what you might be able to do with it in a person's home. 
Hopefully, Bitcoin is in the same place. It's currently worse than real money on almost every metric. It's more volatile, less secure (from a real world hacking perspective), less convenient, more expensive. The experience of buying something with Bitcoin is much worse than a credit card. If I'm wrong, then we should expect banks to coopt it. They'll realize it's cheaper, or faster, or whatever, and start offering their centralized version of it to their customers. 
But if I'm right, then banks will be forced by economic common sense to ignore it, while we nerds play with the part that's new: trustless decentralization. Maybe we'll be able to build a whole new market for new types of activities,  the way personal computing did. 
Personally, I think our best bet to do that is with smart contracts, and the possibilities of decentralized organizations and truly "programmable money". But regardless, we need to claim our own turf before we can possibly be better on theirs.

It's entirely possible that "all the applications that make it possible" will require fundamentally different tech than Bitcoin allows for. You couldn't build the modern web on top of CompuServ. 
Personally, I think there's a big chance that smart contracts in particular will turn out to be crucial. If so, Bitcoin would have to make some pretty radical changes to keep its lead.

So my only real knowledge of this case is reading the appeals court's opinion, but it was pretty thorough and clear. From that, it seems that he wasn't convicted for creating an alternate currency, but rather for attempting to pass off his coins as government-issued money. An example of the evidence for this: training materials that advocated mixing in liberty dollars with the rest of someone's change when they bought something from a store.
We can still argue about whether that's a fair conviction, but it's quite important that his conviction was _not_ for creating an alternative currency.

I do think historians have a unique perspective on change and technological development that might lead to better predictions. But I'm not sure Isaacson is a good enough scholar for that to count...

But most people will never have a reason to do that. People aren't going to suddenly want to spend Bitcoin until they _have Bitcoin to spend_. If it's not practical for people to earn Bitcoin, then maybe Bitcoin isn't actually useful.

To be specific, they're using their own forked version of Ethereum PoC5. ( This is very much just a proof of concept, and not intended to run on a real blockchain yet.

AT is really cool, but I think it's unfortunate that a lot of people seem to think that liking AT means you need to spread FUD about Ethereum. 
Ethereum has released working, open-source code for the following:
- [Three]( [interoperable]( [clients]( which are polished enough that an average developer can [get one up and running the testnet]( in a few minutes. (The testnet is very functional, and currently has 4-second block times due to [their extension of the GHOST protocol]( They're aiming for 12 seconds when they go live with the mainnet.)
- Compilers for [three]( [higher-level]( [languages]( that make it trivial to write complex contracts.
- [Javascript bindings]( that make it trivial to write a front-end for your contract.
You can use all of this right now if you know any basic programming, because in addition to the technical work, they've been keeping up with [good tutorials and examples]( There are already people building [ambitious and complex systems]( on top of Ethereum, and IBM is [using some of the code]( to run their IoT proof of concept.
We're potentially at the forefront of some truly revolutionary technology. It's unbelievably petty to argue about which of the two teams working hard to push the state of the art forward to prefer. I just want to build some dapps and DAOs, and I'm happy with anyone who's making me tools to do so with.

Imagine if Bitcoin were a centralized system. It would be incredibly simple. You'd store addresses and balances in a database, and have a way for one balance to go up while another goes down. It'd take 20 lines of Python and about half an hour of work. 
Satoshi's genius, and the reason Bitcoin isn't 20 lines of code, is that he found a way to make a system as powerful as a centralized one, without the dangers of centralization. 
The same analysis applies to other Bitcoin-based technologies. The basic idea of Counterparty is also really simple. You need the ability to issue new assets, transfer arbitrary assets, and trade among them. Maybe it's a night of work instead of half an hour. But again, the reason Counterparty is cool is that it does it in a decentralized way. 
The idea of Ethereum is to make this analogy literal. What if there was a blockchain that handled the decentralization part, and all you had to do was write the 20-line script? That's what Ethereum offers. Once it's live, you won't have to spend six months building a decentralized app, because they'll have done the hard part for you. 
The hope is that this will spawn a new explosion of decentralized experiments, by radically lowering the barrier to entry.

I know that you've probably gotten the idea by now, but here's another data point for you:
Up to this point, I've been extremely happy with my Trezor purchase. It's a joy to use, and has completely changed the way I use Bitcoin. If you look through my history, I've made more than one comment praising Trezor in strong terms. I had absolutely zero interest in competitors or clones, because $129 seemed like a steal for such a good product.
Now, I will likely never buy or recommend a Trezor again. Not only is your change bad for the community and the ecosystem, it directly harms your core value propositions of security and ease of use. A locked-down and unchangeable "security" device is worse in many ways than no device at all. The change also makes me reevaluate my trust in you and your ability to react intelligently to threats, which has a direct impact on my trust of your code.
Finally, I work in the Ethereum space, and there has been talk recently of trying to adapt the Trezor firmware to work with Ethereum. Since that would now be illegal, I imagine people will be looking elsewhere. So there are additionally entire new markets that you are shutting yourself off from.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:59:36
I would agree about 2 of the 3, but hardware wallets are really the best of all worlds. The only downside in my opinion is cost. I love my Trezor, and can see it being ubiquitous in the future if they can make it dirt cheap.

The point of the demo is the smart contract. The money used to purchase Tiny Human is automatically and trustlessly split between Imogen and the other contributors. That wouldn't work if the Bitcoin blockchain were used instead of Ethereum.
The btcrelay, when it launches, will presumably make it possible to pay using Bitcoin-denominated tokens. It'll still have to run on the Ethereum blockchain, though.

He's explicitly talking about potential future innovation. His point is that Bitcoin *isn't* a threat to fiat currency until that happens.
