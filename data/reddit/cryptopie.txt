I mean, it's possible. This Yahoo post certainly reveals something. Fact is we will never know for sure.
Another thing I noticed, is that both Dorian and Satoshi both like to use numbered lists consistently. I know that isn't proof by a long shot, but even in that awful Amazon review, he uses numbered lists. Satoshi also used them regularly in the bitcoin forums. It shows both had structured thought processes.

The problem is, very few people actually believe Gox really has coins. They just sold u a fictional number in a database for 300 euro.

Gox don't actually have as many coins as they claim. They are selling u a fictional number only, not actual real btc. 
But its your choice.

@_date: 2014-02-20 23:25:01
You're assuming that Gox actually have any real bitcoins. The likelihood is that they don't and people have simply been trading fictional bitcoin for last several months/years. Hence people are exchanging into $ which pushes the bitcoin price ever lower

It's an interesting debate. In some ways bitcoin could compete with Visa certainly. Bitcoin is a currency/payment processing/bank hybrid. In this sense it's competing with the dollar and other currencies. But also Visa, PayPal as well as traditional banking. If bitcoin wins out it replaces all of these industries!

Yes more coins enter the system but at a very very slow rate due to increasing difficulty. People probably lose their private keys to coins on a regular basis and so in real terms there are probably more coin lost than new coins entering the system.

I'm not in this to sell if it drops. I only invested small because £40 is something I won't miss. I don't play the lottery so I figure this can be seen in a similar way. I could lose that small investment completely or it could pay off in a good way. I'm not a rich guy by any means but have a savings account with a few hundred pounds in. Just thinking to pump half of that into btc.

Isn't this comparing apples and oranges? Visa are a payment processing corporation and bitcoin is a currency?

But they are earned. People spent money on electricity to earn bitcoins.
If all the gold mined out of the ground had been evenly distributed to everyone upon discovery, would it have value? No it wouldn't. People value things because they want more of something and if other people have it, the price goes up. Hence intrinsic value. Bitcoin is no different from gold.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:44:57
Anyone buying now, is still an early adopter.
Less than 1% of the population know about bitcoin. And less than 0.1% own any bitcoin at all. So it's not too late
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:22:33
The creator of bitcoin wanted it to be a currency with no middlemen, that's true, but how do u get bitcoin into the hands of millions of people without the exchanges?
Also, there are only 12m btc in the world, probably a lot less due to lost coins etc. But there are 6 billion people on the world. Supply and demand therefore dictates that before bitcoin can become a currency, it needs to first go through a rapid value growth phase.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:42:03
Exactly. Makes me sick that city bankers make over $1m per year out of other peoples misery. Its so nice that normal people are able to benefit from something new and exciting like bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-04 00:04:41
Because the maximum number of coins is limited to 21m and there will never be more than this and the last coin will not be mined until the year 2140. So its not like your analogy at all because its not possible that someone can find 10m extra coins tomorrow. It simply doesn't work like that.

@_date: 2013-12-02 22:59:32
Gift a portion of the coins to trustworthy family members, such as mum, dad, brother, daughter etc. each individual has a tax free allowance and so by splitting them up before selling you will pay significantly less tax.

And that's why you'd only give a thief the private key to your small "ready cash" wallet to placate them enough to just run off, rather than giving them the key to your offline "savings" wallet. If that makes sense.
They of course don't even need to know how many wallets your own and so distributing your coins to a few wallets would be a good idea for this reason. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:44:39

This is great for techies and geeks.

Well your question of what would the value be if people only bought it to buy things with, the answer is nothing, because you wouldn't buy bitcoin to just spend immediately on a McDonald's. You would just pay with $.  why add an unnecessary step into the process. 
Generally speaking people buy bitcoin for two reasons only. 1) speculation on future value or 2) to buy illegal goods on the dark markets.

In the business world, a "moonshot" often refers to a one in a million opportunity. Something with big risks but with gigantic rewards if successful. Larry Page of Google often talks about moonshot strategies, of which Android was considered one of their early moonshots which paid off. Google Glass and their self-driving cars are also moonshots. The term originates of course from the moon landing expeditions which were considered a one in a million chance to get right. 
I assume the "to the moon" phrase refers to this type of mentality. In that bitcoin is a moonshot with huge potential upside if it is a success.

Presumably people will write Wills (the same as they do now) and they could leave their wallet passwords in the Will or some similar solution. They could also simply tell their heir the wallet password on their deathbed or transfer their wallet funds to their heir before they die.
I don't think it is a problem. In 100 years tech will be so much more advanced than now. We'll have wearable computers and our wallets will probably be embedded into our wrist or something! It won't be a problem like you think it is.
