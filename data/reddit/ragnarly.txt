@_date: 2015-12-14 21:57:47
The [International Bitcoin Real Estate Association]( has over 200 members around the world, several of whom are experienced attorneys who are excited about what we're doing. I worked for the 3rd largest title insurance company. My particular startup has a team whose institutional real estate experience spans decades. So, yes we do have a strong legal background. 
We're not pushing ideas. We're building a real company backed by real VCs run by real estate industry veterans. The blockchain title product is an addition, and an alternative to, government records. (Deeds do not have to be recorded at the county office to be valid, but it's common practice). Property owners can record at the county and on the blockchain. 
What do you mean by "Courts honoring"? The vast bulk of title work is performed by title insurance companies and real estate attorneys, not courts. Almost all title disputes are settled between title companies or in private arbitration. A property buyer determines what he will accept for proof of valid title. Being able to view and validate a property on the blockchain will decrease fraud and costs, and speed up the escrow process. 
I'd like to give more technical and business details but we're still in semi-stealth mode. But look at the legal validity of Overstock and NASDAQ proving ownership of assets using Bitcoin colored coins.

The arguments and the types of regulation proposed for Bitcoin are the same ones for the fiat financial systems; accredited investors, a license to deal in financial instruments, etc.


The near complete collapse of the legacy financial system isn't a data cluster among other (Counter) data. It was the sum total result of the existing financial system. How much more comprehensive of data can you get? Nor was it random. It was perfectly predictable. Government insisting banks lend to unqualified home buyers, the Fed regulating the money supply to create artificially low interest rates leveraged everything up creating the greatest bubble of the last 100 years.


Yeah, what does Satoshi know about the safety of regulated financial systems?

Mathematical semantics is diluting the point which is, if any of the above people had their money in Bitcoin rather than fiat, they would still have their money today.
A criminal is anyone the State says is a criminal. Roger Ver was thrown in federal prison for over a year for speaking up about the role of ATF agents in the death of children at the Waco seige.
The State is most dangerous to political dissidents and the poor in developing nations. This is what Andreas Antonopoulus gets all worked up about. 
Faster, less expensive payments are great. But for me, Bitcoin's meaningful value is protection from State malevolence.

That's what I was thinking.  For example, you start a business that delivers cell phones with UAVs. The coin you create lets users pay for the purchase, contains the GPS coordinates of their house, and the code to unlock the phone. The coin itself is part of the innovation of your business. The coin has demand, it  comes from clients who want to use your businesses.  That's the value,  not a speculation play.

So the financial incentive is not that your create a sidechain with a coin that increases in value, but your chain adds a feature or use to Bitcoin, which then increases the price of BTC? 
If so, then your profit (Or loss) depends on the thousands of other factors that move the price of Bitcoin. This is a weak incentive. 
Are there other ways to profit from your sidechain? I'd much rather the financial incentives come from creating useful applications rather than "Rent -seeking" and currency speculation.
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:21:08
Escrow. Right now multisig is good for securing your OWN wallet. But multisig for escrow doesn't work when the buyer, seller, or escrow each use different wallets (E.g. Electrum vs Multibit). Would you call this cross wallet compatibility?

Let me see if I understand, are there always two addresses that need to be funded? What I mean is, does Cryptoauction have its own (Hot) sort of a general purpose wallet? One that will be used to fund the multi-sig address? 
So, first a buyer sends bitcoins to the first (Cryptoauction) wallet? Then when he's ready to buy, he sends funds to the transaction specific (Multi-sig) address?
If this is how it's done, is the first (Cryptoauction) address multi-sig? Sorry if this is explained in the tutorial, but I'm on my phone.

I was born and raised in California.
You're conflating the State (The government apparatus of power) with the entrepreneurs and natural resources that lie within the arbitrary geographical lines called California. Every State is a malevolent,  inefficient,  UNnecessary evil parasite. Everything it purports to do has been proven to be done better by private companies. 
Roads? Have you driven around L.A.? I have toll roads in my area and they're excellent. They cost less to build than public roads which everyone pays for, even if they don't use them. 
Schools? Is California ranked  on the nation? Much better and cheaper per student are private schools, charter schools, home schooling,  Khan Academy, etc. 
Security? Google LAPD police brutality and corruption. It's staggering. How many days would it take for a private security firm to go bankrupt and its employees in jail if they did what the LAPD does on a daily basis.
All of the above are twice as worse if you're poor or a minority.
Non profit research? Isn't that what non-profit organizations fund, such as the American Cancer Society? 
Farms? Ask central valley farmers what state agricultural protection of minnows have done to water resources for their crops. A private water company, whose customers would be the farmers, could never get away that.

This isn't Vigilantism, which is when private individuals: 1. Act as a jury by deciding if a person is guilty, and 2. Act as a judge by deciding the punishment. Roger is asking for help in collecting evidence, just like cops ask for help in collecting evidence when they interview people, provide a phone number to call, etc. When a child is kidnapped the parents will often raise money for a bounty.
Our current "Justice" system spends too much time on victimless crimes and/ or on consentual activities between two adults. Look at the depth and breadth of the destruction the war on drugs has caused. Roger's bounties are to collect evidence for actual crimes, ones that have a victim. 
I greatly hope Roger's blockchain evidence + bitcoin  payout  bounty concept catches on. Decentralize everything @_date: 2014-04-11 03:49:17

This is a terrible idea. 
1. You're weakening Bitcoin fungibility. The units of a currency have to be fungible with one another otherwise it's not a currency. 
2. Anyone can send bitcoins to an existing "Tainted" address, thus making it nearly impossible to untagle the stolen coins from the other ones that were sent there. 
3. Anyone can "flag"an innocent address on blockchain.info, thus negating your purpose of doing it. And that "Innocent" address will then forever be marked as nefarious. 
If you don't understand, give me two of your Bitcoin addresses. 
Your idea has been proposed before, discussed ad nauseum, and shot down for lots of reasons, some of them listed above. On bitcointalk.org, search: Mike Hearn, coin validation, black or red lists.
With fiat, scammers are identified by their name or website. You don't find out the serial numbers of the dollar bills they've used, then put those numbers in a database. Why not? The answer to that question is why your idea is terrible.

Cops won't get paid for "Going around arresting people". Arresting does nothing. Rather, to get paid,  a cop has to 1. Upload evidence to the blockchain and 2. The accused has to be tried and found guilty by a judge or jury. And in fact,  because any misbehavior by a cop in collecting evidence could get the case thrown out, the cop must strictly adhere to investigation protocols. "Going around arresting people" would be the last thing they would do.

I might get downvoted for promoting our site, but these bitcoin thefts from escrow is inexcusable now that the community has the technology to prevent it. 
At [AnArk.it]( we have a "Trustless" escrow which means we never hold your private key. We use multipart keys. You need three parts and our server can only see two of them at any time. The third part is created client side. So we can't steal funds, and if our server gets hacked, neither can a third party. Our escrow is based off the open source [Casascius Escrow Scheme](

Yes. And if you are hold funds then you must comply with all of the state escrow laws such as insurance, licensing, liability, etc. 
Instead of focusing on the escrow/ arbitration function, we can focus on the "Transfer" function. Some sort of "Safe", "Unstealable", "Distributed" transfer.

Most businesses in most countries can accept whatever they want for payment; various fiat currencies, gold, services,  etc. Bitcoin is no different. There's software that keeps your books in bitcoin. It can convert the daily exchange rate if you want to track the dollars in fiat. Businesses have to pay taxes in fiat though. 
Only China, Ecuador,  and maybe one or two other countries have outright banned accepting BTC as payment. Just because there isn't a law that explicitly states you CAN use bitcoin doesn't therefore mean bitcoin is prohibited. It's like when the Internet came out,  there wasn't a law saying companies couldn't accept payment with a website, people just did.
Bitcoin is volatile. For me at least, it's volatile in its long term climb upward. 
Like the emergence of the internet, permissionless, mass adoption will dictate regulation. If a lot of people like and legally use bitcoin then most politicians won't risk messing it up.
Anarchists were some of the earliest adopters, developers, and entrepreneurs of Bitcoin. They still make up a large portion of the community. Thank them! : )

How about making each local Bitcoin MeetUp group the human/social "Node" of this network? Similar to a "Chapter". 
- The social network is already in place and it doesn't need any funding. 
- The organizers of the Bitcoin MeetUp groups aren't in it for prestige or power. 
- Each group is locally focused and already puts on mini-conventions. 
- Everyone wants a decentralized BTC exchange. But with Mycelium and LocalBitcoins used at MeetUps, it already exists.

As far as I know, we're the only ones with a "Trustless" escrow, meaning we don't hold your private key. There are some multi-sig marketplaces that are in development, but none that are functioning today and/ or easy to use. Tip: If the escrow can charge a % transaction fee, they hold your private key (Excluding properly done multi-sig).
Our escrow implements the Cascacius  system written by Mike Caldwell. Once multi-sig becomes operational and easy to use we'll consider using it.

I don't have time to explain the [Colored Coin]( and [Counterparty]( token technology in depth. But I think if you study them then you'll understand what we've been trying to explain to you. Individual properties aren't fungible, but liquidity doesn't require fungibility, only a decent size pool of assets and a low-friction transfer mechanism. If there's 10,000 properties, whose ownership is controlled by a (Fraction of) bitcoin, one could buy and sell hundreds of properties for pennies in transaction costs, in minutes, using any Colored Coin or Counterparty wallet.

Each property will have the price listed - Instant valuation.   


It doesn't represent the title, it IS the (Digital) title. 


Bitcoin is the most public record system in existence. 
The colored coin or Counterparty token contains a data field where the property's address, owner, easements, contract terms etc. are listed.  


Again, data fields will contain info easements, warranties, contract terms etc.

A few of us have been working on escrow and title off and on for almost two years. In my venture prior to [meson.RE]( my (Then) partner and I created an implementation of the Casascius scheme to do "Trustless" escrow. Here's a [five minute video of my presentation]( at the L.A. Meetup group.  The challenge with holding bitcoins in escrow for real estate transactions is that volatility makes a significant impact when you're dealing with transactions of $500,000+. There's a workaround we're doing for now. Better solutions are in the works.
Bitcoiners who aren't real estate professionals have underestimated the tedious complexities and legal nunaces of real estate title. That's why despite enthusiastic, but naive proposals, there's currently NOT a  blockchain title solution that the title industry would use or the government would recognize. Be skeptical of claims to the contrary. I personally was working with two different groups a while back, but we couldn't make it work.
I had a core dev contact me recently saying he's working on some exciting real estate projects. Considering his track record, I'm confident he'll succeed.
