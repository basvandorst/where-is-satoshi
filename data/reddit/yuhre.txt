Right now, the ability to short Bitcoin is very limited. 
For those that don’t know what shorting is, it works something like this: 
The exchange or brokerage holds bitcoins. I borrow bitcoin from them and sell it to you at 18. I do this because I think the price will go down. The price goes down to 17. I buy it at 17 and return the borrowed coin and keep the difference.
If the price goes up, I still have to give back the coin I borrowed, so if it goes up to 22 and shows no sign of stopping, then I have to buy it at 22 and I loose 4.
Price moves up because of buying pressure. More people want to buy at the price than want to sell at that price. The price has to increase enough until it finds someone willing to sell at that price. 
That is why the price keeps rising. Everyone wants in now because the price is rising so fast and they don’t want to miss out on the riches.
This increases the amount of buyers and drives the prices up even more. That is where we are now with the added bonus of very limited money available for shorting ( remember that to take a short position you must SELL)
So, right now bitcoin is like a bottle of water in a sun parched desert. If you want to buy it, you will have to pay.
Another guy selling water comes along so now you can buy at a better price.
Three more guys come selling water so now water is cheaper.
So, when will the price of bitcoin go down?
When people start selling it. If you bought at 18 and the price goes down to 16, are you going to sell? What about 14?  Well, you and everyone else and that will drive price lower.
Remember, the shorts are salivating in the wings waiting for this thing to open up. Then, they are coming in and they are SELLING.
Nobody knows when or if this will happen, but it seems more likely than not. Don’t buy on margin.
I’m just a random internet person and I know nothing. Just offering food for thought.
