You not caring  ≠ "They had until last month the longest track record of not screwing their customers."
It's not about you.  It's about MtGox.

Sentator Manchin, 
Your reasoning is unfortunately lacking:
Your argument seems to rest in a large part on the assertion that bit coin is used for illegal activities and its disruptive to to economy.  Cash and guns are used for illegal activities - should cash and guns also be comprehensively banned also Senator?   How many crimes have been supported by cash or guns compared to bitcoin? 
Financial institutions have been used for illegal activities - should they be banned also Senator?   
Financial institutions like banks have been a few billion times more disruptive to the economy (e.g 2008 global financial crisis) than bitcoin.  How many people lost their jobs and struggle to feed to their family because of of the malfeasance of banks compared to bitcoin?   You are looking in the wrong place by about a million orders of magnitude.
Senator, if you want to protect the economy from shocks I suggest you spend your time on things you have already regulated The people will be fine without your interference in bitcoin.   You need to demonstrate you can appropriately regulate financial institutions and other crimes first before we give you any consent to regulate bitcoin.  Even then, its unlikely.
Thanks for the offer of your help regulating bitcoin, but I'm pretty sure we will be better off without the help from the government.   Bitcoin's an experiment in decentralized commerce - it defeats the purpose if you regulate it.
We already have an existing formal economy and regulations and we use it when appropriate.  Please spent your time working to improve the formal economy and leave the informal economy to us. Yes we will make mistakes and we will learn and people will lose money but that's the way we want it. 
Thanks.

Perhaps you haven't been through 20013?   MtGox have been screwing their customers for a year now.  Ever tried withdrawing USD from MTGox?  They consistently posted false information  last year about the 'delays' with getting USD out of MtGox.

Spot on - You can't ban ideas.

MtGox are not "handling all the traffic".  They will pretend to execute a USD/BTC trade with you but they never deliver the USD.  Taking a commission from you for the trade then defaulting on the settlement is not "handling the traffic".

When you say "MtGox prices are much more representative of global trade" I think that is wrong.  Mt Gox is only representative of trades that can't  be settled (i.e. Mt Gox default on the delivery of USD).  Some trades are eventually settled if you pay 5% extra.  If you want to trade and not have the exchange default on the delivery of USD, you have to look at price on other exchanges that trade BTC/USD.

IMO, The USD/BTC price on a exchange is only meaningful if the exchange can actually settle the trade.    What's the transaction costs associated with getting BTC China to settle in USD?

+ 1 .  Exactly right .  Best explanation I've seen so far.
