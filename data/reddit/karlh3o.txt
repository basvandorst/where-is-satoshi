It seems really crazy to define a BTC exchange as a gambling site. I know we joke about a risky investment being gambling, but it's not. No bet is made, no lottery ticket purchased. There's no game of chance and no predefined concept of winner or reward. I might say I won in the stock market, but that doesn't make it gambling. I suppose some people might call my Fidelity account online gambling.

I think I got coinlab mixed up with one of the many services I've been reading about over the last few weeks. Now that I look it up, coinlab seems promising but isn't offering anything yet.
What other options do I have for getting bitcoins? I either try to get some money onto an exchange through a service like bitinstant, or I go looking for someone to buy coins from or trade with on a service like bitcoin-otc or localbitcoins. It seemed like bitinstant -&gt; mt gox -&gt; btc was the fastest, easiest, and safest. Am I missing something? Any suggestions?
Of course it would be awesome to sell a product or services for btc... I'm working on that.

Can't these coins be tracked? If the thief doesn't properly launder them, maybe he can be discovered.

Wouldn't double authentication with your phone break any phishing scam? Or could they act as an intermediary, route everything through their server in real time to coinbase, and use the same pin/phone authentication to gain access when you do?
On the plus side, it seems to be speeding up at coinbase. I had to purchase in 1 coin increments, but I was able to get some btc this morning.

Bitcoin is designed such that all transactions are public. It is not anonymous unless you take precautions. If the person who stole these coins is not careful, it will be possible to trace the address to a person.
I never suggested blacklisting coins and actually hadn't even thought of it. As it turns out, coins have been blacklisted before, but I agree that it doesn't make sense to blacklist coins for the reasons you describe.
My point in bringing this up was to see what others thought of tracking down a thief, or at least attempting to.
Some reading on taint and mixing services if you are interested:

You don't need to be verified to buy bitcoin on Mt Gox. I'm at 1000 something in the queue, and I just used bitinstant to wire a few hundred dollars to MT Gox and bought my first bitcoins. All in about 30 minutes including travel time to the 7Eleven. There is a daily withdrawal limit of $1,000 when not verified, however I don't see anything about a deposit limit. 
Of course there are some fees to use the bitinstant/moneygram method, and it's kind of annoying to be in a 7Eleven messing around with a kiosk and phone, but it was really fast and bitfloor prices are higher.

This is a big speed increase. When I signed up 3 weeks ago I was 1500 in queue. It took 12 days to get verified.

Thanks! That's my first tip!
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:52:25
My btc are stuck on coinbase until the transactions clear. Doesn't matter too much, I bought at 94, so I'm just waiting to see what happens for now.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:40:10
No way. This is Japan. They are drinking Hibiki 30 year served by kyabajō in a skyscraper bar. Wish I could join them. :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:27:30
Thanks, that's much easier than searching through their forums.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:31:45
I bought at $94... but I'm not selling. I'm just laughing. Goxxed... I'll remember that.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:22:40
Same for me. I got interested at 47. Signed up around 55 and bought at 58. Only took a few days. You don't need to be verified to buy and sell. Verification just increases your limits.

I also like this one:

You only lost 15% of your coins... be happy!
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:22:55
Yeah, paypal might freeze your account and reverse the charges. Of course the Bitcoin transaction can't be reversed, so at least one person gets screwed.


There are a lot of other options out there. If you are looking for a more person to person experience:
(Full disclosure, I've only used bitinstant-&gt;mt gox and coinbase.)
@_date: 2013-03-20 18:35:29
I used Coinbase to buy my first bitcoin yesterday. If a company has access to your bank account, they really can't screw up like this. The wild west coding startup that hacks things together during all night red bull fueled coding sessions is probably not going to work. This shit can't break!
I guess I'll try bitinstant and coinlab. ~fingers crossed~

I bought a few coins this morning, but I had to do it one coin at a time. I could get a coin, then it would fail with the "reached its maximum number" message and then a few minutes later, I could buy 1 coin again.

If you do decide to add a battery and the ability to transmit transactions, I would vote for using a Bluetooth connection to smartphone to broadcast the transaction. 
* Smartphones with Bluetooth are almost ubiquitous.
* They are much more likely to have an internet connection everywhere you go (don't need a WiFi hotspot).
* You won't have to worry about logging into wifi with a small screen and 2 buttons.
* Bluetooth will use less power. (I think, some of the new WiFi chips are amazing.)
Of course, if you are using a smartphone, then maybe you can just plug it into the smart phone USB for communication and power. Depends on if the smartphone has USB OTG, right?

Loved this quote:


I wish more retailers realized this. I think paypal wouldn't stand a chance if they did. Regardless of market price for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:38:24
Yeah, you can send Bitcoin that easily. More info:

No, the OP used the term "straw man" incorrectly. Using a straw man is "replacing it [the argument] with a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the "straw man"), and to refute it, without ever having actually refuted the original position."
Just having a weak argument for your side doesn't make it a straw man. Making false implications regarding what others have said isn't a straw man.

That looks pretty cool. What application are you using to view the exchange activity?
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:28:03
You don't need to be verified to buy bitcoins. You can send them money now and purchase coins.
Edit: According to some people, this may not be true outside the US...
@_date: 2013-03-23 06:49:06
I live in the US. Bitinstant is setup to quickly get money into Mt Gox. I don't know what or if there are limits on Bitinstant transfers. I just wanted to get a few hundred into my Mt Gox account.

It also crossed my mind that the website is flawed in a way that creates bad keys. Maybe someone found the site and discovered the flaw in key generation, then used that to direct an attack. 
Check out the Security section where it talks about Sony for an example of flawed keys:
And that math is pretty crazy looking. Who knows how the site is generating the keys.
Nevertheless, I agree with you, start with the site owners. At the least try to get the site shutdown.

I think coinbase is definitely getting faster. I had almost no trouble buying today. I'm not upset with them, they are a new company and were just caught unprepared for this incredible demand.

Link? I would like to read more on his changes but I'm not finding anything...
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:44:54
Looks easier than it was for me to buy my first bitcoin.
