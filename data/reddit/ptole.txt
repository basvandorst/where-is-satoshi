Oh my god please videotape/audio record this meeting somehow. (Or at least come back and tell us how the conversation went!)

My daily motivation to trade and be involved is, of course, an attempt to profit in a volatile market. I kind of like that I can daytrade without anyone's permission. I don't need a minimum balance, I'm not blocked from participating for not being wealthy enough, which is a nice feature.
As for why I continue to stash and build a BTC bankroll, even as I spend it, well it's quite simple: the technology is a revolution in the making. It's gonna take a while for the world to catch on, and hell it might not even be BTC at the top of the charts in 5 years, but... the blockchain and modern decentralized economic theory is not going away. Every day/week/month more and more people have that "a ha" moment on why crypto could really change the world. 
I am involved daily for profit and selfish interest, but I am hooked into the idea for much more important reasons. When someone asks me about BTC, my ensuing passionate rant has absolutely zero mention of daytrading or profit. The idea, the potential, that's really why I'm here.

Use open/close points for fib endpoints, not the session extremes.

Obviously as the sponsor of the event, no one can blame you for asking what you want - but unless you have specific reasons for wanting the scene as described, at *least* removing all of the requested pieces/components and just leave it as a general theme, or a one sentence description, etc. Something like requiring a physical representation of a bearwhale animal slayed on a battlefield is about as specific as you should get. You're reducing the chance you'll be pleasantly surprised or blown away by someone's genius by dictating so many particulars that should be part of the scene.
If it's going to be displayed, or used for promotion, or a t-shirt or whatever else, then clearly you may have good reasons for wanting *your* vision. Otherwise, give the creative types the opportunity to surprise you. Not trying to pile on, just want to encourage this point! :)

Change starts somewhere. It's not going to be painless.

99% might only be *hoping* for it, but stories like these are why there is 1% of us *working* towards it. Naysaying is as useful as fanboism - that is to say, not very.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:37:59
How can we be certain you will pay up? 
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:21:38
So - still net profit then? Seems more like encouragement than punishment.

Where is the clause in v8 or a separate legally binding document that the previous contract is null and void? You can't just "sign a new one" and call it overwritten.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:50:44


Except you made an account specifically to post about this dispute.
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:12:51
No, it means an account that can't be frozen or seized by a state sponsored gang.

This is my question, how do you possibly go insolvent if you're rigging the game without anyone looking over your shoulder? Is it free catered lunch and champagne every day at the office or what? Everyone getting bonuses instead of paying bills?
The corruption has to go a lot deeper than illegal trade practices or simple mismanagement if they're actually insolvent *while* being able to front-run and stop-hunt (which I totally believe they do). 
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:40:35
God damnit, pizza places don't open for another few hours here - dick.
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:03:38
Did you add the toppings yourself? Looks great for a frozen!
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:11:43


Good thing we have emerging technology with the potential to change things, eh? Sure as hell can't rely on elected officials.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:23:42
Hah... if the OKCoin exec's were confident they were in the right, they wouldn't need to offer a bounty for help. What a joke.
The PGP emails are proof they both signed v7. Why would they resign another version? Where is the PGP exchange where they talked about it or exchanged a new version? Please. Ver has you fucked.

The pains of price discovery. Outside of "the next bubble" (or maybe two), late 2015/early 2016 is when the market will IMO become healthily bullish and perhaps even sustain it for a good while. Late 2016 is the next halving from 25 new BTC every ~10 minutes to 12.5, and I would think in the year leading up to that event we'll start seeing it get priced in. The price discovery we're seeing now and the downtrend is mostly supply and demand. Yes manipulation and shenanigans make waves, but in the bigger picture, it's still trumped by supply/demand. Adoption works to increase demand but between: early adopters, the low amount of of coins (in relation to total supply) on the markets, and 3600 fresh BTC created every day - there's a good bit of supply pressure in a still relatively low-volume market. 
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin's market performance is amazing, I'm long bullish all the way - but this is still a pretty small market when it comes to price discovery. The tech and the rate of adoption/awareness will definitely win in the end, but this is a dangerous time to be a bullish trader or to leave large bankrolls in BTC if the money is significant to you.

That's not what an "index" is, so I doubt it. It will likely just be an average of whatever exchanges they deem worthy enough to be included.
@_date: 2015-05-24 08:40:10
Ok - but how is he faking PGP exchanges? Why would he sign one version, then happily sign another that - conveniently - simply adds a clause for OKCoin to back out with minimal expense? You can talk about his character all you want but how about the facts of this situation, let's address those.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:34:03
Well good thing OKCoin is completely legit and would never do such a thing.

I know the article is talking about donors, but there's a user in this story that PayPal hasn't been friendly to. A non-freezable account seems pretty user-friendly to that guy, I bet. Knowing your donations aren't held by a corporate overlord is pretty user-friendly, I'd say.
The services/abstractions will just keep getting better to make BTC easier to use. Stories like these are why. I bet this guy looks into trustless decentralized services a bit more as a developer. Thx PayPal, you keep doing you. We'll handle the rest.

Leave other hints around the house that future owners might discover? If it's just gonna be sealed there and hoping on pure chance for someone to come upon it, I think there's a real chance it never gets found. If there's a legend to it, or if someone knows there might be something in the wall...
Also unless the dollar is allowed to become deflationary (hah!) at some point, that'll just be a nice piece of historical currency. The BTC though - BTC is so good for time capsules! Genius idea.

I think all sides need to learn that trying to equate price with performance during significant inflationary stages is folly. 2014 was an unbelievably huge year for Bitcoin from where I'm sitting.
I'm a Bitcoin believer, I think the blockchain is nobel prize level innovation/technology, and I'm pretty damn optimistic that this is the beginning of something great - whether it's Bitcoin itself or if the Facebook to BTC's Myspace comes along - I think this technology is *massively* important and is not going away. It's probably easier to distance myself from the emotional response, because I'm not a buyer/holder, I trade and long and short when it's appropriate and am in and out of BTC all the time.
Detach yourself from the price. If you can't manage to do that, grab a calculator and work out the inflation that BTC is going to experience during each block reward cycle. The hyperbole is severe on both sides - so give yourself the knowledge to ignore it for what it is. I look at 2014 and think it was absolutely incredible for Bitcoin and it's price chart has almost nothing to do with that. And personally I couldn't be happier that the price has tanked because I didn't get into BTC heavily until just before the crazy 2013 bubble.
TL;DR - Stop ignoring all the reasons why the price makes perfect sense, stop expecting miracles for an early retirement, and consider Bitcoin's 2014 for what it really was; the biggest and best BTC year yet.
