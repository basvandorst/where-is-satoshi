It's a target that you have to hit before you can pay out any profits - which means it acts a lot like debt. Sure, having 550k verified accounts is a minor advantage, but not compared to existing exchanges who have verified accounts and a strong brand.
The debt we're talking about here is probably hundreds of millions of dollars worth. It would mean this exchange is starting from a serious disadvantage.

Except they can sell and then claim the loss so it's not a real long term loss.

That is incorrect according to the article. You would have to pay taxes based on the dollar value of the coins you mined on the day you mined them. 
This is similar to vesting RSUs at a company.

While this would be an amazing story, it would require some very wealthy investors willing to take a tremendous risk to help get this exchange started. It will take a lot more than dedicated engineers willing to work for free. It means financial services integration, legal counsel, accountants, hosting, etc. 
If all those pieces can come together altruistically to make this happen and then find the luck needed to make the exchange successful it would be a fairly tale ending indeed.

This isn't something they can or will do.by this logic, vesting stock would be a dangerous proposition.

Did you read? Yes they have to pay taxes at $1200. But they can sell their coins in the same tax year, take the loss from $1200 to whatever the current price is, and it's fine. 
It's the same as if you vest stock at a company and then the share price drops.

Basically, this idea is akin to starting a new exchange but instead of starting from scratch, starting with a ~700k bitcoin debt.
If we're going to the trouble of starting a new exchange, marketing it, and taking on all that risk, why would anyone want to run that as opposed to a business without any starting debt?
Is there some competitive advantage this exchange would have over the existing exchanges or one that could be started by said management group tomorrow on their own? Without such a competitive advantage I don't see how it could become successful enough to repay the debts owned by Gox.

Can I ask why? I understand the benefits to merchants, but as a consumer the only real benefit is that you save a few seconds on the transaction. And you give up the 1% cash back as well as chargeback protection. 
The only reason I as a consumer would really care about paying for Dropbox with BTC is if I wanted anonymity for the data I'm storing with them.

Nope. That 3% is a marketing fee. It's sole purpose is to get you to spend more on amazon. They aren't taking that money from anyone to give it to you. It's amazon's money which they want to spend on customer retention.

Of course, using an escrow service adds fees and inconvenience. And while this doesn't completely remove the benefits of using bitcoins for the transaction, it bring them much closer to credit cards.
