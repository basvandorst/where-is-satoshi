The Fed could print a trillion dollars to buy up all the Bitcoin, and they still wouldn't get mine. They'd get a lot of it, but they wouldn't be the only ones buying as the price climbed toward a million.
If they then dumped it from a million to $100,000, I'd use my profits to buy back more than I had previously.
Even the Fed and their magic bullshit money couldn't kill Bitcoin. All they could do is drive the price way up, then dump it to a level much higher than now, as has happened before. That's the difference between a supply controlled by math vs a supply controlled by a bunch of inbred idiots.

The best paying skill sets are not taught in "school".
If you are getting a paid ride: do it.
If you are accepted into a 1%er program: do it.
Everything else is better learned outside of school without debt, or in a trade school.
Working a mediocre paying job and living frugally (invest large sums into long term assets or physical assets) is the best financial method anyone who is not blessed with inheritance can make!

Reading up on the history of BTC since 2013, there has always been talk about wanting a "slow and steady" or more "healthy" rise. But this is Bitcoin. There seems to be no such thing. ;) My husband even said that he was sure that this last bubble would be the final one. I wasn't so sure, but the FOMO was there and I figured maybe he was right? There was more interest than ever and talk of an ETF finally being approved. I do think that there might be a point in the adoption curve where it is kind of like the point of no return and we no longer have these dips. But so far it has been the same cycle over and over and over. But if we are following an S-Curve for new technology, it should end well.

I think its really only info for those that want to understand the tech a bit more and how it works (like OP) which I commend because its far more interesting than the USD price.
But Johnny Mainstream doesnt need to know or care about it. Same as I dont care if my Bank account balance of $5.00 is made up of 50x10c payments.
Although, I would care if it meant it cost me more to send that $5.00 because it was made up of 50x10c payments than 1x$5.00 payment and I could make it cheaper to transact by consolidating the payments to myself for 1c when the network isnt busy.

It's not always a bad idea to short. There is a legitimate reason for shorting: hedging. This is not what most amateur idiot "traders" do when they short Bitcoin.
If you were buying $100 million in BTC, you would do well to place a $10 million short with high leverage. That way, if the price falls, you don't lose money on your big buy. If the price doesn't fall, oh well, you lost a few million on the short but made much more on the long. That is the only smart reason to short Bitcoin. If it were a stock, a short might make sense if there were signs that the company was in trouble, but it's not a stock. Shorting is stupid unless you're doing it as a hedge.
