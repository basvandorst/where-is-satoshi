Probably because of the cash flow. Me ex trader myself and during one year of me trading localbitcoins I managed to reach 1mln eur turnover. Crazy times cashing in and out &gt;10k eur in one time. And I wasn't a big fish. If a trader is a whale he'll defo be redflaged by a bank, following tax people and maybe even police. That kind of money floating in and out to a bank account from different bank account will rise suspicion in no time
