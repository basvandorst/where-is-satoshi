You want us to send you BTC?  On your Birthday?
We will send you something far more appropriate: 'virtual birthday cake' to your cake address.
I just sent you one.  Did you get it?
Come on Bitcoiners, send some more cake.

Sew witch is the best coin I shouid be looking at they're?
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:06:32
Oh yes.  Most don't use your wallet.  Just take live prices from exchanges.
I'm not a trader (or only very occasionally), so it's just nice to track your hodled portfolio.
I have used Bitsnapp (Android, there may be a fruit one, don't know.)   Very quick to set up.  You can set a primary and secondary currency - I use USD and BTC.  What's not in the manual is that all you have to do is tap at the top of the screen to switch between the 2 currencies.
(I only use this feature to track Bcash's descent into hell vs BTC :) 
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:44:40
Is that why nobody goes to your parties?
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:32:01
It's true.  Everything about you is available.
BTW, I don't like the color of your bathroom suite.  And your milk is out of date.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:11:22
I have defended you, and you are right to have your views.
But you have written that you 'hate' Bitcoin.
That is not helpful to anyone, and is an extremely biased view.
If I were to go on any subreddit, and write that I hate what they support, what would the typical human reaction be?
Anyway, I support you.  But will not engage any further.

They were in the cafe under the grill.

I thought we'd trained RIMS.  
He definitely bought BTC the other day, so is now conflicted.
He probably trolls himself now by writing notes to himself, like 'fuck off RIMS', then puts them in, and takes them out of his waste-paper basket repeatedly, feeling increasingly confused.

They are over at Conbase, buying it.
But then their greed kicks in, and they buy 51,000 shitcoins instead.
The shitcoin crashes (quelle surprise), so they come back filled with anger.

You can make your own subreddit you know.  Why not call it r / sadcunt and hang out there?

So, you - literally - shouted out **'DECIDING POINT'**
That could be very embarrassing, was anyone watching?
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:07:33
Fair enough.
Last party I had at my parents' home it was completely trashed.  Broken bottles, people throwing up, drugs, girls, open sex, fights.  It was terrible.
I had to leave with my friends and leave my parents and their crowd to get on with it.
My Mom and Pop apologised for their behaviour the next day and cleared it all up.
