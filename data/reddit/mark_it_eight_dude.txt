People trading actual goods for bitcoins are butt fucking retarded.

Heh, nope not mad I just enjoy seeing speculators lose their money. Since this butt fucking circlejerk insist on upvoting ever single stupid ass article which could possible inflate the price of this nonsensical "currency", sometimes I get to see these posts on the front page and come by and comment on them.

That must be why you're on reddit complaining about it.

A dollar is worth a dollars worth of actual physical things that are purchased with it every day. 
How much is a bitcoin worth?

So then by accepting bitcoins in trade for actual goods you're trading an actual physical thing for something that could have no value. Sounds like a perfect reason not to trade actual goods for bitcoins.

You're a dipshit. Hope you didn't have any future plans with that money.

He's the dipshit that brought it up.

Someone, somewhere in the transaction loop is trading things or money for bitcoins and those people are fucking idiots.

So you spent over $30k on something from the internet from someone without even a phone line? Solid investment bro.

The difference between the two is that dollars are accepted everywhere and bitcoins are accepted virtually nowhere. So, a bitcoins worth of actual physical things in most circumstances is 0.
