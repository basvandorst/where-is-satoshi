Why don’t old nodes reject the bigger blocks then? Funny how old nodes enforce block size while you claim they allow bigger blocks...
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:18:28
Yea having free stuff dropped in your lap is suuuuuch a chore.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:02:49
You only say that because it proves you wrong. The point is that it makes sense to care about who you are doing business with and refusing to support bad actors.
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:20:54
They just want to stockpile Bitcoin in general. Stop straw manning.
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:45:48
bcoin is awesome
@_date: 2019-03-15 11:53:43
That’s not what was asked. If you’re going to be a smart ass then at least be smart. The question wasn’t why aren’t we talking about it now. The question was why isn’t it ever talked about period. Now try again with a less smug attitude. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:19:51
I never liked them. I hated them when they wouldn't let me pay an invoice with a Bitcoin wallet of my choosing until I used a curl command to get the actual Bitcoin address from their stupid invoice format.
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:52:49
It’s not the price. It’s the hassle.
@_date: 2019-03-12 08:10:20
You think I don’t know that?
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:23:05
That’s still not a block size increase.
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:39:49
So if they didn’t sell to black people that would be okay since it’s unrelated to the product?
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:06:29
It’s my personal opinion. We need atomic swaps. Having to deal with scammers and prove you are legit is not worth the hassle to me. Don’t like my opinion? Stop reading then. Pretty simple.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:16:32
Segwit signatures aren’t part of the block. Stop lying.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:57:58
I already explained it to you, idiot.
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:12:09
Escrow sucks dick. Pass.
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:15:52
It's not a block size increase because the non-segwit nodes don't have bigger blocks. QED.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:33:20
Not in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:43:38
Non-segwit nodes don’t see bigger blocks. This is the last time I tell you.

Too bad they use BitPay. Dead to me.

Enjoy being smug and self-satisfied.
@_date: 2019-03-07 07:05:42
Your comment is literally the first time I’ve read that it was purchased with SquareCash. All the headlines and articles I’ve read never mention it. So thanks for helping him out, I guess.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:05:06
How can the blocks miners create be bigger if non-segwit nodes don’t see bigger blocks? They can’t be. Because the blocks aren’t bigger.
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:29:38
They are segregated witness blocks aka extension blocks. Non-segwit nodes don’t see them and don’t care about them. That’s why segwit is backwards compatible while block size increases aren’t.
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:29:12
Yep, hideous. Might as well just give it to me so they don’t have to look at it anymore.

That’s irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-02-16 09:40:24
Market cap is mostly irrelevant to spot price.
@_date: 2019-02-24 23:07:08
If you use BitPay then you are scum.
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:00:16
Fuck ledger. Went to buy a nano x, saw BitPay and noped the fuck out of there. Ledger is dead to me now.

You’re a retard.
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:44:32
Bitcoin can’t fail because of a lack of a feature. The only reason Bitcoin lacks a feature is because we are conservative about changes made to it. We are conservative because we don’t want to break Bitcoin. But if Bitcoin is in danger because it doesn’t have some feature, nobody will be conservative anymore.
@_date: 2019-02-16 15:14:40
Market cap doesn’t tell you how many coins are sitting on exchanges waiting to be sold.
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:44:18
I almost bought a Ledger until I saw they used BitPay. Ledger is dead to me now.
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:33:22
BitPay invoices are retarded. You can get the actual Bitcoin address using a curl command but I shouldn’t have to do that. The only reason I do is because they are greedy fucks trying to force everyone to use wallets that they approve of.
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:12:09
Amazon sells thousands of different products. Bitcoin is just one thing. The categories of “store” and “money” are not analogous.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:59:20
Nothing has intrinsic value. Things are only worth what you can trade them for.
@_date: 2019-04-28 21:24:47
Stop playing dumb.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:45:52
What's your point?
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:44:10
Ledger is dead to me because of BitPay.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:50:16
market cap is meaningless!
also, look at this awesome market cap!
@_date: 2019-04-28 11:56:59
Why are we holding BTC if price is just a distraction?
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:01:37
What the hell are you blabbering on about?
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:57:15
You sound kind of whiny.
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:46:19
Uh yea, but people are trying to pretend like they don’t care about the price.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:24:18
If you don’t like my replies then stop talking to me. I don’t really care either way.
@_date: 2019-04-24 22:00:01
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:39:55
Market cap tells you nothing. That’s why it’s meaningless. Spot price and VWAP is what matters.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:48:26
Either way, it’s trying to speculate on currency.
@_date: 2019-04-19 11:10:04
Moving goal posts. First your complaint was about waiting 100 blocks but now you say there needs to be more due process and neutrality. Stop trolling.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:31:43
I think a good path is whatever people choose but then again I’m not an egomaniac that thinks they know what’s best for everyone else.
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:58:20
$800 for an escort? Her butthole better be spotless!
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:02:23
That’s because your strawman is stupid.
@_date: 2019-04-29 11:55:44
Sure some people don’t but my argument was never “every single person cares about the price”. You talk about bad faith arguments but then you can’t even be bothered to understand what I’m saying.
My claim is that if you hold a volatile asset long term like bitcoin, it’s most likely because you are trying to speculate on the price and sell it for more than you bought it for.
So, most of the people holding bitcoin and trying to pretend like they don’t care about the price are full of it.
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:41:32

@_date: 2019-01-20 08:53:42
Look at both.

You’re arguing semantics.

Go away troll.
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:35:04
Replace it or perform as well as it? Those are two different questions. You’re the one talking about a fantasy land where PoW has failed. If PoW has failed then either something must replace it or cryptocurrencies can’t exist.
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:54:42
Wow, BOOKS? You must be really smart then!
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:40:58


Well, he's not wrong.
@_date: 2019-01-30 16:28:13
Those people are ignorant of cryptocurrency. If you understand economics AND crypto then you’re a maximalist.
@_date: 2019-01-30 10:39:49


Do you not understand logic either? That’s exactly what is implied.
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:53:39
Most people don’t understand economics and finance and how markets work.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:32:58
I'm glad it was posted here. Thanks OP.
@_date: 2019-01-18 16:01:32
You are assuming that if PoW fails we will just try PoW again which seems kind of like a silly assumption.
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:01:32
You are talking in circles. If Bitcoin fails and you can’t spin up a new coin using PoW then at that point PoW has failed.

The great thing about anti-fragile decentralized systems is that they don’t need you to worry about them. Most people can happily ignore it and it doesn’t matter. Bitcoin is inevitable.

Are pirates going to replace fiats?
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:01:54
That’s not what I said. Read more carefully.
@_date: 2019-01-18 19:20:22


Read the whole context, not just a single phrase.
@_date: 2019-01-18 14:05:12
That’s not a description of an anti-fragile system.

Look at Mr. Money Bags over here with his Fancy Feast.
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:58:28
That’s not how market cap works. Just because Bitcoin market cap goes up billions doesn’t mean billions of dollars of Bitcoin were bought.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:08:33
I don't think condemning them for lying is ridiculous at all.

Being too expensive for your use case is not the same as bitcoin “not working”. By that logic, airplanes don’t work for people that can’t afford the ticket. Coincidentally, I’m posting this via in-flight WiFi. It seems these things can still actually fly, regardless of ticket price.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:11:00
Nah, I think it’ll be like a hosted service model. Kind of like how kids have their own Minecraft server that they pay for but don’t have to manage, people will have their own bitcoin and LN node they pay for but don’t have to manage. They will still control the keys though.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:57:57

Where did you come up with that definition?
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:52:28
You called heads and it landed heads. That means you made a lucky guess. It doesn’t mean you can predict coin tosses.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:39:11
The reality is that good and bad fees are subjective. Why not claim it needs to move $1 with no fee instead of $100 with a small fee? Some people can’t even afford the small fees.

In other words, you’re full of shit.

Neat but also pointless.

What is this based on?
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:38:17
You sure are a good mind reader. Can you guess what number I’m thinking of?
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:54:21
How “easy” it is was never up for debate.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:15:58
That’s your easily manipulated opinion. I think the most responsible way is to go public so we all know what’s going on.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:55:31
You are not in a position to make demands of them.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:18:48

He didn’t say they can’t be parents. He just said that they won’t be as good of parents as straight couples and that’s only statistically speaking, not every individual case. There are certainly gay couples that are better parents than some abusive straight couples.
