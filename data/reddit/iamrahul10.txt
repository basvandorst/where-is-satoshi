OP's history show's that he's promoting Zebpay.
But, I am a user of their service. They can be trusted and 100% reliable. The company is from India and is targeting Indian users, mainly.

I am from India. And I am pretty much sure that if the masses starts to use Bitcoin and when it gets wide recognition, the stupid govt will regulate it. I bet that's gonna happen here. There would be zero anonymity.

That's true, man. Both Zebpay and Unocoin needs verification with PAN card. 


I think I am the online one in my city who knows about BTC. None of my friends or colleagues are aware about it. So there's no option of localbitcoin traders. Sadly. And I am not looking for anonymity. I was just mentioning that, when BTC becomes mainstream here in it, one of its core purposes will be defeated.
