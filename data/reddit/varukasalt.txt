I say things that piss people off from time to time, but that's because I'd rather be honest than live in denial of how I feel and think about things. When it comes down to it however, my previous post is how I attempt to live my life. Am I always successful? Fuck no. Do I try to pay attention to my own contradictions and deal with them? As much as possible. I haven't met a "normal" or "perfect" person yet, but I sure have met a lot of people who don't even bother trying. I try not to be one of them. That's really all I, or anyone, can do.

Almost all the issues I've have have been with video drivers, and those have all been fixed. I haven't had to actually "fix" anything or do any maintenance for at least 2 years.

I didn't say he was religious, I said he was a creationist. That is a specific point of view that only a certain subset of religious people adhere to. It is blatantly anti-science. FYI, I was raised catholic and was never taught creationism. I was taught science, which includes biology and evolution. Anyone who denies the validity of evolution denies the validity of the scientific method in total. That is an extremist view.

All right, forget his user base. Glenn Beck is a lying asshole at best. He's an extremist. He is poison.  Not the kind of person we want to actively promote bitcoin to, nor someone we want representing the bitcoin community. If he is, then I don't want to be associated with bitcoin any longer. I don't care if all his listeners turn out to be boy scouts that spend all their spare time helping old ladies across the street. He is vile enough on his own to not be a positive to the bitcoin community. If the consensus of the community is that a person of his ilk is of benefit, then I will at that time have to withdraw my support an divest. A this time, it doesn't seem to be the case.

Are either dollars or gold an emergent technology who's success depends on mass acceptance? Dollars and gold are well established, bitcoin is not. Bitcoin has poor reputation in many circles as "that drug money". Bitcoin already has an image problem with a large portion of the population for a variety of reasons. Being associated with someone like Beck is not a positive selling point. It may be for a very limited group, but not for the general population. I'm really having doubts about the viability of bitcoin due to the constant hostility of the bitcoin community to outsiders. There is a very us against them mentality here which needs to change if bitcoin is ever to gain mass acceptance, otherwise it's going to be an interesting but ultimately pointless experiment. I'd really hate to see that happen.

Intellectual exercise here. Is it really generalizing when talking about a group like listeners of a political radio show? These people have chosen to listen to a certain type of show because they identify with whatever is being said. That's not the same as saying all people of a particular ethinic/racial/nationality/whatever group have factor x in common, because they have no control over their inclusion of that particular group, and will be included that group no matter if they wish to be or not and regardless of any beliefs they have. Basically I'm saying, it's not completely incorrect to generalize about a group that has selected themselves to be in that group. Is saying all Catholics are xtians generalizing? Absolutely not. That is a core *chosen* characteristic of that group.

I'm not generalizing, I'm focusing on a specific group, glenn beck listeners. He has a large number of extremists in his base. This isn't generalizing, this is fact. Would it be generalizing to say that almost no liberals are among his fan base? Possibly, but that doesn't make it false. Either way, Glenn Beck is not a positive for for the Bitcoin community IMHO.

Again, speculation. Anyone can guess. We are looking for a specific reason for this spike. Did another bitcoin business come online? Was there some news about some government acceptance / regulation? Is some new large corporation accepting bitcoin?

I actually am a pretty cool guy day to day. Like most people I'm pretty opinionated, but have to keep it under wraps in the real world. I tend to let my id have a little more of the freedom it craves online. Certain things and certain arguments that I've had a million times already can put me into Internet Asshole mode. If you look at my comment history, it's obvious I don't really care much about karma. I'll say what I feel and damn the consequences. I've only deleted things that I later realized were inappropriately offensive to someone either mistakenly or inadvertently. Sometimes I do comment just to hear myself. I work with a bunch of guys who don't speak my language, so I don't have anyone to talk to till I come here, so I tend to spew a lot, like now.  
TLDR; I'm actually pretty cool, just don't self censor on the net much and I like run on sentences.

I keep most of mine on my phone, since I'm practically stapled to it anyway. I only use online wallets for immediate transactions. I don't trust PayPal as far as I can spit them. They seize money at the drop of a hat. Security and brand trust? Not PayPal, not from me.

I'm talking really small amounts here. Like, I'm starting with $60. As for the other, the emergency is already here. I've been out of work since Jan 2 because someone rear ended me and now I have 3 ruptured discs &amp; may require surgery, so yeah, I'm going lite on the speculating.
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:20:10
Are you referring to the incorrect "too" in the title? I noticed that right after I posted, but since I can't do anything about titles, I didn't bother bringing it up.

They have increased their verification speed. I was 4200 about a week ago, and am now verified. They did hire additional employees.
@_date: 2013-08-18 23:58:57
OK, my confusion level is over 9000 now.
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:33:02
What he did wasn't a bug, it was a lapse of some pretty basic security. About as dumb as leaving your wallet at the scene of a crime. None of this had anything to do with computer code.
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:38:36
Why thank you very much! You're being awfully generous around here. World needs more people like you. :)
EDIT: Now I just need to figure out how to get this to the wallet I already have. Damn bitcoins, you complicated!

Solutions for this are already in the pipeline, and you should soon be able to buy BTC directly with your CC or bank account. The main problem is implementation of regulations specific to the United States.

I know it's not super impressive, I use my TV as a second monitor via long ass HDMI cable. The other monitor is next to my chair. Wife has tower and laptop setup to my left, roommate with double monitor setup to the right. We had the kids in here until recently, so at one point we had 6 computers and 9 displays going...all in the living room. It got pretty hot in here in the summer. And yeah, cable management, I for sure need it. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:20:30
Did you already have the cash in your mtgox account? Apparently, I have to be verified just to make a deposit, which is what I'm waiting on. When I choose dwolla as a funding source, it just gives me a link to the verification page, no way to actually transfer the funds.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:10:03
Are you in the US? I don't see any option for me to do that, not one that doesn't take a few days. Oh well, once I'm verified, it won't take this long. Still will take 3 days from my bank to Dwolla. What a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:06:27
So, has anyone else not received their Staoshi yet or is it just me? I still got zip.

That's why I'm getting in small. Real small. I'm just trying to get my hands on 1 BTC right now. So far.... 0.0095, thanks to a generous tipper. I'm not worried, I'll get there. If I can only buy a fractional BTC when I'm cleared, that's what I'll do. Main point is I'll be in, and I can afford to loose that $60 I'm putting in. I'm going to see how far that initial investment can take me, and if things go well, I'll toss a few bucks in here and there when I can.

But it does maximize short term profit. I know I, for one, would only need the profits from doing this once to live more than comfortably for the rest of my life. I know some people are never satisfied and want more and more and more, but I think I would be happy with enough to live the rest of my life to not risk something like that again.

Honestly, I'm just here for the money. I'm investing very little right now, about $100 total at the moment, and will throw in more as my situation allows if I continue to see the price increase. I really couldn't give a rats ass about all the other stuff. Frankly, I think most of it is ridiculous pie in the sky stuff (states collapsing due to lack of tax revenue, the dollar becoming worthless) that I don't believe will ever happen. What I do think will happen is that people will continue to buy, speculation will continue to increase. If bitcoin is to really make any serious inroads as an actual currency, it is going to have to get way, way easier. I'm extremely tech savvy and my roommate is a computer programmer for a major (like really major) online merchant, and we've been going nuts just trying to get our hands on some coin, much less coming to an understanding of the underlying technical principals of bitcoin. I think it has great potential, largely as a way to relatively easily transfer funds globally, and also to change from one (is there a word other than "fiat", I really don't like to use that word, as it's rather tainted by the anti-gubbment crowd) form of currency to another.  I'm actually very interested and engaged in politics, but in this one instance, I really couldn't care less about the political ramifications of bitcoin, I'm just really tired of being poor, and this seems to me, at this present time, to be a good opportunity to make a little money, and so far so good. Also, I love run-on sentences. :)

Correct me if I'm wrong, still learning. All of these bank transfers take 3 days or so, I don't have any merchants in my area, and doing a cash deposit at a bank requires me to print something out &amp; I don't have a printer at the moment.

That's pretty much their stated goal, as insane as it is. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:33:10
I know. Unfortunately, I won't be able to get in that soon. I the mean time, I'm learning tons about the market, and watching it like a hawk. When my funds are available, I'll just wait till the next artificial "panic" and swoop in at the bottom. I'm in this for the long haul with a small amount of money I can afford to loose, so I don't have to worry about "wiping out".

I don't. If they don't have the guts to weather small fluctuations like this, then bitcoins aren't for them. Better they get out now before they loose themselves lots of money. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:28:29
NO.....not saying that I would personally do that. Just saying that for some people, making the quick buck is all they're after. They could give fuck all about long term profits or the consequences of their actions. I mean, look at Wall Street all day long every day.

So, for us n00bs, what does that mean? More interested in the financial ramifications (if any) than the technical aspects, although that is interesting too.

@_date: 2013-03-28 01:21:14
But it can reduce stress and produce peace of mind. I'd sure like to not have to be stressed out all the time, worrying how I'm going to pay my bills. That would definitely improve my standard of living and make me happier. I do understand what you are saying though. I have some extremely wealthy clients. Most of them, actually, and I've seen some incredibly miserable multimillionaires. Of course, I've met several down to earth and downright pleasant billionaires that seemed to be very happy with all their cash, but not necessarily because of it.  My needs and wants are pretty modest, so I'm hoping I can accomplish them with bitcoins. Or at least get started in the right direction. This paycheck to paycheck crap is wearing me down &amp; I'm pretty tired of it.

@_date: 2013-09-24 11:10:43
I don't see how bitcoin helped here at all. Actually, they were a hindrance in this situation, because you had to exchange them for cash first. Now, if you had sent her the BTC directly, then yeah I can see your point. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:45:13
Or you could quit making assumptions about me and my life. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:44:28
You really think they would portray it in a positive light? Holy fuck there's some serious delusion happening here.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:45:59
How much did the wire transfer cost? I'm moving a tiny amount of money. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:13:51
I wonder if they understand that advertising this way is guaranteeing that I, and I'm sure many others, will never even consider doing business with them.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:25:35
It is also required for deposits depending on where you are located, and what funding source you are using. I'm one of the ones waiting in the queue, and I can't do shit until I'm verified.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:05:32
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:51:53
I rest my case. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:45:43
Oh fuck. I spent over an hour on this yesterday. It is required of all American bank account holders using Dwolla. Went over and over and over this yesterday with someone, only to find out they were in NZ and using a Swiss bank account. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:27:35
No shit. I got USD just sitting there, waiting for verification.  9 days to go.... :(
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:24:30
I have done my homework. Please stop assuming that my opinion is based on ignorance. You're not talking to some teenager. I'm not in favor of libertarian policies or ideals either. They're based in fantasy. If the only reason you think I disagree with you is because I haven't been "educated" you're sorely mistaken. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:36:35
Ideologues, gotta love 'em.
@_date: 2013-06-11 02:20:24
Then why does every other telephone company, even prepaid, require this information, but you don't?
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:28:00
They are now!
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:12:27
Everybody's got to start somewhere. Remember, on the internet, perception is everything. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:35:54
Oh I know. The place is full of tin foil hatters too. I'm pretty good at spotting them. I'm not much of one for buying into conspiracy theories and the like.
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:08:36
No, it's a way to find which posts are more popular. Popularity vote does not equal censorship. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:41:23
Did anyone read through the comments on that article? 90% of the people have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:07:14
You could trade those in right now on several exchanges for many different currencies. Not sure what your point is.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:41:09
Way, way too much.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:00:35
I'm in the US. I'm just getting my toes wet so we're talking really small dollars. My plan was just a couple days ago to put $50 in to buy one coin. By the time I was ready to submit, it was $60, so that's what I put in. Now, buy the time my money is available, I'll be lucky to get .5 BTC. I'll see how things go, I'm watching the market like a hawk now. IF things keep going like they are, I'll put in more money as I can. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:09:14

I remodel swimming pools for a living. I like the job, it's very satisfying, and I do donate some of my time and expertise to those in need (sometimes there are old widows with a pool and no more money), but there's no fucking way I'd do it for free all the time.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:35:32
Sounds like great advice. Thank you, I'll be sure to do that!
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:30:34
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:07:19
Yeah, that's why I'm only putting in $60 right now. I can afford that.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:35:05
A bastion of verifiable information, that place is.
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:22:19
Yeah. A washed up lunatic who never did a thing (except fleecing his supporters for millions) endorses bitcoin. Please, help me curb my enthusiasm.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:19:25
Apparently he missed the part where Farmville made millions of REAL US dollars?

So...anyone in the market for a Commodore Vic 20? I even have the box! :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:48:22
Yes. I'm currently waiting on verification from Mt Gox so I can put my measly little $60 into bitcoins, and I plan on putting as much spare money as I can into them. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:46:09
"I got mine, fuck you" is pretty much what I hear from them. Same thing I guess.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:32:57
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:17:28
Walmart used predatory pricing to drive small mom and pop stores out of business, then jacked their prices. This is a well documented fact. You're either willfully ignorant or delusional. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:16:35
You'd be surprised. There might even be a socialist or two around...
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:23:00
Don't see getting one of those either.

I'm not talking about Bitcoin itself, I mean these ridiculous, non-fact based, pie in the sky, fanboy circlejerk posts. 
 Hey guize, Bitcoin is going 2 b 11ty billion phony fiat dollarz bi tomorrow. No...fer realz this time...
No one talks about any other financial instrument this way, because it's idiotic and immature. Drives serious people away in droves.

They still exist even if I spend them. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:42:09

Quite possible.
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:20:19
Yes he does, ignore and downvote.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:00:52
Not many. From my understanding, Chinese are using Bitcoin to bypass cash export restrictions, and move money out of China. Where to, I don't know. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:43:10
Yes. 50-100 K would totally change my life. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:31:22
Yeah, there's no one within an hour of my location, and their prices are really high.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:53:32
They made a post yesterday stating they were hiring 3 new people today, and I have seen some movement in the numbers. Hopefully things will pick up soon. I'm going nuts with my money stuck in limbo. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:52:00
Can I crash at your place tonight?

We are back over 800 on all exchanges.

Wow. My reading comprehension was a total fail here. Thanks.

Same here. I have no love for the Austrian school.

No way what?

All of them.

Market capitalization. Basically all the BTC in the world now have a net worth of over $2bln USD.

Better keep one more going just as a control, you know, for science. I'd be willing to take one for the team.

It's called profit taking. Happens in every single market everywhere. We're already back to 66. Buy now before it's $100

Just joined. Waiting from my money transfer to go through so I can get my first coin. Of course, since I initiated the transfer, it has gone up so much, I won't have enough for a full coin. Oh well, gotta start somewhere.

It's been all over NPR this week too. At least one story a day.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:27:17
100% 
Once I'm verified I can transfer funds at will, but as of now, I have $60 tied up somewhere between them and my bank that I still won't be able to touch until I'm "verified" which could be up to 10 more days. :(
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:53:32
Brand new account. First post. Seems kinda fishy to me. Should be easy to prove me wrong. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 22:55:48
Congratulations. You just invented Wal-Marts business model. Does a great job of driving everyone but you out of business.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:39:56
I understand Austrian economics, I just don't agree with it. A difference of opinion does not mean ignorance and that attitude is getting really old around here.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:32:14
You're not going to get anywhere with these neo-confederate types. They really don't give a fuck about anyone other than themselves and fuck brown people. And they wonder why people look at bitcoin funny. Because asshats like these are all over it. Fucking ruining something that could be incredible. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:36:19
Oh, well that's good to hear! TIL :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:01:56
No, I understand what it means, I'm more than well informed on the subject. It's idiotic.

@_date: 2013-10-05 16:46:20
Come on. He used his real name as a gmail address. That's incredibly stupid. Period.
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:48:26
I'm shocked. This is my shocked face.

What the hell are you talking about? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:22:08
Same here. I got $100 floating around in the ether somewhere between mtgox and Dwolla. Can't wait to go bottom feeding.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:49:08
NO! You need to be verified now. It will take at least 10 days before you can trade on Mt Gox. I've been posting about this for the past couple days.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:28:25
Maybe you did, but I didn't. I never used my personal name on any gmail account. The only place that has my real info is Facebook, and only my name, and my account is private. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:00
Wait a minute. Making money is a problem now that shouldn't be discussed?   
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:04:51
They're buying in the 1000 BTC unit range right now.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:31:03
8 more days (at least) before I'm verified so I can't buy anytime soon anyway. All the other ways to buy bitcoins more quickly are either not available in my area, not available in the US, or are just too expensive for the small amount of money I'm trying to send. I'll just have to wait it out and see. After this initial verification period, it won't be a problem. Wish I knew earlier, I've actually had my MT GOX account since 2011, but just never got verified. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:05:24
And a dessert topping!

FYI, MrGOx still has a huge backlog. 5000+ waiting in queue. I'm 2960, and I've been in line for 4 days now.
