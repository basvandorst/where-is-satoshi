The argument is Gold vs Bitcoin. You can't do jack with bitcoins.
If this is the case we might as well start valuing land and commodities
like water or food.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:07:08
Thats purely your opinion. I haven't seen a solid argument for bitcoin. If there is room for me to dispute your claims or rebuke them, you've failed.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:00:00
Same to you friend.
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:19:30
What then is the intrinsic value of bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:24:47
I can spend gold too can't I?
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:15:08
Thats a fair argument.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:12:33
You obviously didn't see the post where I mentioned that I sold all my BTC for gold.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:24:36
All the gold I have is literal pure gold stored in a secure vault by a security company.
Also, the tech to make gold isn't going to be around for a few lifetimes.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:52:01
Gold is a largely required commidity in many things, its not just pretty to look at.
Gold will never become useless.
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:05:10
Right, so when the economy fails i'll have this gold that has been used to barter for centuries, and you'll have your precious bitcoins which won't be usable unless someone finds a reason to give you your internet daily.
When your computer fails and you need gold for the circuits in your computer, i'll have gold and you'll have bitcoins.
Nicely done editing your comment after.
But guess who buys gold? Everyone. The value of gold? Universal.
I can go to africa tomorrow and pay drug lords in gold to start a war.
I can't go to a minimart with bitcoins to buy a soda.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:23:47
Yes, in life people make up their minds. It takes a solid and well grounded argument to change your mind. My mind has been that my safely secured gold that is guarded by armed and trained personnel, deeds, contracts and insurance is far better than a crypto currency that you can depreciate in value as quick as it gained, and be stolen far more easily.
I understand what barter trade is, apparently you don't.
So the next time the cryptocurrency isn't secured and another 100+ billion coins are made, or another hosting company is hacked, or you get scammed by a phisher, or you lose your wallet, or a million other things that can and have gone wrong.
Next time that happens, silly old me will be sitting on physical gold of which no lack of demand exists.
So when you stop trying to insult my intelligence and instead help me understand what are the concrete benefits of bitcoins, i'm afraid I cannot do anything but dismiss you.
@_date: 2014-08-08 08:58:21
I can take a single gold bar or one of those cute little cube nuggets they suggested that I should have. I can carry one in my pocket, and nearly anywhere in my country sell the gold for a fixed price.
Let me ask you this:
If someone came up to you and asked you to change all of your physical gold that has long been valued as THE asset to have, into some online currency that has failed many times before, and only recently in a short period of time has risen to semi-high levels...
Would you?
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:01:25
Both have monetary value.
Gold is liquidatable anywhere and everywhere.
Gold has intrinsic value.
In three sentances I have shown two ways that gold is better
and one way on why intrinsic value matters.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:12:53
Who needs to check what is secured by bureaucracy.
@_date: 2014-08-08 10:39:00
I don't care what you do yes. But in the context of presenting an argument, I provide an analogy. I still don't care what you do.
Also, bitcoin has suffered many server faults causing the loss of hundreds of thousands to millions of bitcoins. Bitcoins have also been exploited thrice leading to the creation of more than a billion fakes.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:42:52
To be even remotely secured you need a password of 15 characters all of which must be random. Can you remember that? Even then...
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:19:23
The gold I have is marked and stored in a vault only me and my parents have access to. The place is literally guarded 24/7 and there are insurance policies backing the gold, as well as several contracts that state if any of it goes missing, the companies must pay reparations. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:19:35
If the internet is down?
Last I remembered there were warlords fighting over land and gold just for the sake of it. Who can resist the offer of gold for protection?
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:03:26
I need something that would definitively make me want to convert hypothetically millions in gold into BTC. This is no small venture.
Also, i'd like to point out barter trade. Gold is something physical, not a currency. People will want it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:43:47
I give up after having explained countless times i've physically touched it.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:06:07
Not really an argument...
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:51:18
Gold has inherent worth, at the very least its something I can have. I can use it to make things.
What can I use bitcoins to make when the economy fails?
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:44:44
Right, thats your problem. I don't care about what you have, I care about a solid argument that can convince me into using bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:11:44
The next generation hates gold, sure. Just tell that to china and india and dubai and... you get the point. I carry my wealth in physical deeds.
At any one time someone can con you out of your wallet, the value of bitcoins can drop significantly due to it not being secured by a physical asset, and hell, someone might just steal the SD card.
At any one time my gold is lost, insurance and the company securing it has to pay me a large sum of money and a police investigation is formed. 
Which officer is going to look for your SD card?
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:14:43
With the value of gold i'd say it'd be more of a "Driving in large convoy to giant fort".
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:16:07
Who needs to send gold physically, when you can liquidate gold almost instantly?
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:08:13
Well, this imaginary physical metal that can be transported anywhere instantly has basically invented teleportation for all of us.
Hypothetical scenarios fail.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:28:13
Personally I still prefer gold because it remains a physical malleable asset that has high demand and the ability to turn to cash quickly.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:15:05
They gave up like me? What part of branded and sealed in a 24/7 guarded vault do you not understand?
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:50:25
I've felt it.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:25:54
I had some bitcoin back when it was less than a dollar. When the price hiked I sold all of it for gold. It seems too flimsy for me. At least gold has an actual physical value; i.e electronics, circuits etc.
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:31:37
Diversification only works when its sensible to diversify.
Would you rather have an item that is worth money,
or would you rather have a digital item that people say is worth money?
Crypto currencies are only worth as much as actual
currencies are.
The demand for gold exists forever, not just for jewelry but
for circuit boards and electronics.
