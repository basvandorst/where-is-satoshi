That's wrong because the bubbles were bigger when BTC was cheaper. The previous bubble was to $220 and then to slightly over $1000. That's only 5x. $32 to $220 is like 7x.

Except that's not what the market price was. The $1200 figure was due to really long withdrawal times at Mt.Gox and if you sold at that time you would have money still stuck there. This is because they were already insolvent at the time. That's why withdrawal times were really long.

50 Gh/s is 0.0041 BTC a day in bitcoin
if you had clicked on my link you'd see you'd get 784 myriad a day with 50 Gh/s which is 0.0042 BTC a day when exchanged immediately to BTC
so actually it's slightly more profitable, but tracks BTC profitability closely (when it becomes more profitable to mine BTC miners switch, which drops the difficulty and makes it more profitable again)

If we extend the lottery comparison:
You select a lottery number. If it has 7 correct numbers, you win. But it's hard to guess all 7.
So you get together with other people and you say "give me all of your tickets that match 1 number" and you promise to split the winnings between all tickets
there's a chance that your ticket that matches one number matches all 7 numbers, so if you collect enough tickets with at least 1 number matching you'll eventually win the lottery
the 1 number matching ticket is called a "share"
the 7 number matching ticket is also a share, but it's a share that solves the "block" - it wins the lottery
so you just have to mine and submit shares of difficulty say 512 while the current difficulty is 11,756,551,917 to solve a block
There's a non-zero chance that something whose "difficulty" is 512+ is also greater than 11,756,551,917  
you can't just take that money and run, because the transaction to the pool address is coded into the block so your share only solves the block that mines for the pool, it wouldn't be valid for other pools (because the block would have a different mining transaction so the hash would be different)  
because this share that solves the block pays the pool owner, he can split it up between the last, say 2000000 submitted (Pay Per Last N shares - PPNLS) and everyone who mined in the last x hours gets paid in proportion to their hash rate

I doubt you solo mine bitcoin, so you're probably paying a pool fee. You could probably solo mine myriad if you have a lot of hashpower.

Why wouldn't it eliminate PayPal? The average price of an online purchase is around $100 or so (depending on the site) and paypal fees for purchasing in USD are much higher than Bitcoin fees (especially since you can send transactions without fees). And if you add currency conversion, it's even more expensive since PayPal screws you (they quote a number that includes a 2.5% currency conversion fee). Bitcoin is a separate currency, but you can use a merchant that provides the conversion cheaper (1% fee).
But I think Bitcoin will first kill Western Union before killing PayPal.

Hah, you think PayPal really protects you? Let's say that the seller doesn't send you the item. You put in a claim that the item hasn't been sent. The seller responds by sending you an empty box with a tracking number. You now are out of luck because you can't change your claim from "item not send" to "no item in box" or whatever the categories are.
See  for more examples where PayPal actually doesn't protect either the buyer or the seller.
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:30:00
Not true. Let's say you have 40%.
The chance of you getting one block is 40%. But you lose it half of the time you don't find the next one.
So 60% * 50% = 30% chance you lose that first block
40% of the time you find the next block and you're guaranteed a payout since you can release the first two blocks and orphan the competitor
when this happens you literally become 100% of the hash power on the network for the third block since everyone else's hash power is being wasted trying to catch up
if you get really far ahead (like 4 blocks) you can just release two blocks when the rest of the network finds one and never risk anything while being the only productive miner that finds any non-orphan blocks

You can still announce your block and go "surprise!" and hope yours becomes accepted right before the other one does. I guess it's a 50-50 shot and if you have 25% of the network you can get several blocks in a row randomly and you'll be protected from the rest of the chain since now you're the tallest and the rest of the network is mining only one block while you're on like your third.

Look, if you fail, you just get almost even money. You gamble for $100K and fail, you can still win the bet fairly. When you gamble for $100K and successfully double-spend, you win even if you lost the bet.
That means if the casino edge is 5%, you only need to successfully double spend 6% of the time to make a profit.
Ghash has like a 20% edge in the game, they can make bets like $1M and doublespend losing bets 10 times easily in ONE DAY.

Yes, but if you get up two blocks, you're guaranteed to not waste a block. So having 25% of the hash rate you can actually take the hit on the orphan blocks until you get two in a row and then everyone is wasting their hashing power since two blocks is better than one. There's a break-even point (some percentage of hash power of the total network) for this strategy. Having close to 50% it's very profitable, though.

It's impossible to program correctly in PHP. There are just too many corner cases and vulnerabilities to keep track of. For example, you can't recover from some exceptions. Your application just dies, and your error handler doesn't get called at all. So you need to run another php process just to see if your first process did everything correctly for some error conditions...
like for example you can segfault the C interpreter by writing some PHP code that has a bug in it
it doesn't just exit and say "infinite recursion, ran out of memory", it actually just crashes
and these bugs stay open for years and never get fixed

BTC is not made for retail. Use a faster coin. I suggest LTC or doge.
But BTC is perfect for moving large sums of money securely. Its ASIC farms mean it's the most secure cryptocurrency in existence today. Not even a government can get in easily at this stage of the game. Its market cap allows you to buy millions without moving the market.

Same thing happened to the poker site Full Tilt Poker. They had more liabilities than assets (and lost money because the government seized assets). But they got bought by their competitor Poker Stars and PS made a deal with the government to let people get their money back through a combination of the seized funds and some extra money (since FTP was insolvent). Right now people are getting paid for the money they had in FTP. And FTP is now owned by a more trustworthy site.
A similar situation could arise here.

You will get lower variance when mining at two pools than just the biggest one.
If one pool is 50% and the other pool is at 10%, you should put 20% of the hash power at the smaller pool and 80% at the bigger pool. In most scenarios you'll get lower variance than just the small pool or just the big pool. Because even the big pool has bad variance, you only spent 80% of your hashpower on it and you have a better payout than someone who's spending 100% of their hashpower at the big pool.
Using 5-6 pools makes you have almost 0 variance because you already accounted for almost all of the hashrate.

- What is bitcoin?
It is international online cash.
- How does it work?
It has a public ledger. You get a virtual wallet that has a passcode on it that you can put coins into. You use the passcode that is stored on your computer to spend money from that wallet.
- What are wallets and how were the defendants able to 'take' peoples' coins?
A wallet is virtual and it has a balance and a passcode. The passcode is too long to memorize so it is stored on your computer. If this passcode file is stolen by another individual, they can spend coins from your wallet.
- How were they able to 'cash out'? (We have some evidence from traders that have come forward and from marketplace websites)
By sending your coins to an online currency exchange, you are able to convert between bitcoin and other currencies. You can also purchase goods from merchants using these coins.

I think Bitcoin either hits $4000 at some point (not in two years, more like 10 years) or goes to $1 and kind of dies.

Let's work backwards. In the event that two bitcoiners remain, the older one proposes that he gets 16 bitcoins and the younger one gets none. The younger one votes against it, but the vote is 50/50 so the older one gets all the bitcoins.
So when there are three bitcoiners, all the oldest needs to do is offer the youngest one 1 BTC. That will be enough to bribe him in voting for that proposal, since if it doesn't pass he gets nothing. So the breakdown looks like:
3: 15  
2: 0  
1: 1  
If there are four, the oldest one proposes that he get 15, and offers the second youngest 1 BTC. Now it's:
4: 15  
3: 0  
2: 1  
1: 0  
when there are five, the oldest one needs to offer  and  one BTC each so they get the majority:
5: 14  
4: 0  
3: 1  
2: 0  
1: 1  
they agree because otherwise they get nothing

@_date: 2017-03-28 04:08:13
This is why you don't want to change the PoW since the current PoW is the most secure against a state actor, due to the fact that ASICs are already very efficient at mining it. If you switch to a PoW that doesn't have ASICs, a government actor might develop them first and attack the chain.

The frozen/seized use case is only important if you're doing something like playing poker online in the US.
99% of users will never be impacted by it - which means that almost all users will just think it can never happen to them. The value proposition of Bitcoin shouldn't only be "privacy" since that's how you get only shady people using Bitcoin. The value proposition must be fast and cheap transactions. How fast and cheap? Just a bit cheaper and faster than Western Union or PayPal. This has to include the currency conversion fees at this moment. When you sent $10,000, the conversion fees dominate your transaction (then you're competing with bank wires and it's probably not worth). When you send $50, the miner fees are the most relevant.
Bitcoin HAS to beat those services in price, otherwise most people won't see the point. Nice properties like more privacy don't matter to the average person sending money to Mexico. They just don't want to pay $5 to Western Union. If Bitcoin fees actually increase to $5, Bitcoin will be useless for most use cases not involving shady stuff.

At first, yes, but the BTU difficulty would drop in the difficulty adjustment period, while BTC wouldn't drop because it would be just 1/4 of the way into the difficulty adjustment period since it has only 1/4 of the miners.
Actually, I just messed up the math. It would be actually equal at those prices, BTU would have 75% of the original difficulty (75% of the miners use it) while BTC would have 100% of the original difficulty.
Of course, BTU would have more miner fees because of bigger blocks, but I didn't really think of how that would affect the calculations. If the extra fees attract enough miners to come to BTU, the difficulty would adjust up, which would further make BTC blocks slow down to nothing until the next difficulty adjustment period in BTU at which point some miners would switch to BTC again.
But if BTC blocks get too slow, people wouldn't be able to transfer their coins to sell them anyway and that chain might just die off. Similarly, if BTC is way more expensive than BTU, the BTU chain might die off and everyone will come back to BTC.
I think the extra fees from transactions will initially be what miners will switch to BTU for. It's hard to predict what happens after that.

thing is, 0.25% to exchange $100,000 becomes a $250 exchange fee (both sides, converting into BTC and back)

Ukrainians have had those things for years. It's a poor country, but it's not like they live in caves.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:18:53
Harder to happen in BTC. Let's say BTU is $300 and BTC is $400, but the difficulty didn't adjust down yet. Now it's 3x more difficult to mine BTC than BTU because the miners INITIALLY supported BTU so that's where the blocks are happening.
It's not feasible financially to mine BTC until the price of BTU hits below 3x. So you're right that it's both, but ETH/ETC have a different difficulty adjustment algorithm that allowed both chains to survive.
There's a chance that either BTC or BTU just outright die when the hashpower switches to one or the other. Which of course follows the price, but also the difficulty.

@_date: 2017-03-27 12:06:43


That's not quite right. It does so in a decentralized way, which is the actual progress. PayPal was around before BTC. The reason why Bitcoin started to look attractive to people is because the centralized nature of PayPal made PP be able to charge more fees.


True, but 100 billion transactions a year can't exist on a 1MB block settlement layer. Those numbers don't add up either. We're fitting what, like 2000 transactions in a block? Even if you use LN, and you do 100 transactions in LN for each time you need to settle, that's still only 10 billion transactions a year.
So if we want to scale to 100 billion, the block size even with segwit/LN should be at least 16 MB, even assuming a 100:1 ratio of off-chain to on-chain transactions. What if the real ratio is more like 5:1? You'd need blocks 20 times as large.
You might say that Bitcoin won't scale to 100 billion transactions a year ever. Well, I heard that Bitcoin won't ever hit $1000, Bitcoin won't ever hit $100, Bitcoin won't ever hit $10, etc. It's a number that could easily be achievable within ten years.
I think even if you enable segwit and implement LN, you still need larger blocks even for the next few years.

The 1MB limit was never meant to be there forever. I don't think anyone can argue that. It was meant to be there to simulate how to scale when faced with a real limit - when blocks take several minutes to propagate due to their size. At that point, you can't include blocks that take more than 10 minutes to propagate because the chance of orphan blocks increases, which undermines the security of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:12:16
640KB blocks ought to be enough for anybody
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:48:35
Or maybe they'll just have a large block size so they'll be the same size as bitcoin, but the scaling issue will be orphaned blocks instead of high fees.
I doubt users will care about orphaned blocks other than "wait for multiple confirmations" being told to them by exchanges and so forth

Yeah, sometimes it's about how bad BU is
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:52:20
Even if you implement SegWit you still need bigger blocks eventually. You EVENTUALLY need to settle transactions on chain. Even if lighting network was available now, you'd still have congestion because not everyone would use it all the time. You still need to fit actual transactions on the chain.

It's a problem because it doesn't make sense to send $0.50 anymore. I remember when I got 0.05 BTC from a faucet once. At the time it was worth around $0.01 and there were no fees. Of course, it only took a few minutes to be included in the next block.
I understand LN may solve this issue. But when is that coming? 2018?
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:18:21

They clearly do, because if 100% of the miners decide to hard fork then it will happen. The other chain will have no hash power, so will not have any transactions. The difficulty won't drop because of the long difficulty adjustment period, which means that any attempts to revive the other chain will fail.
If 100% of miners get behind core, BU will fail and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:44:26

Ah, but the cost to produce Bitcoin increases because more people mine them. So the cost to produce Bitcoin increases as the difficulty rises. This has been true when it was CPU mined, and GPU mining kernels were written. The hashing power increased 10x, but the cost didn't increase - GPU mining is more electricity-efficient than CPU mining. Similarly, ASIC mining is more efficient than GPU mining electricity-wise (although you do have to buy hardware for it).
But it remains true that Bitcoin (GPU) mining has always been just marginally profitable. Basically, if you were paying residential electricity rate you were breaking even. This is why the difficulty would go down when the price dipped - the people in the US that were paying a marginal electricity price of $0.35 / kWh would just stop mining. This is because it became more profitable to just BUY the coins you were going to mine instead of wasting your time.
Sometimes the price would go up so high that people ran out of second hand 5750s to buy and then it was profitable for everyone to mine and the difficulty couldn't possibly raise fast enough. But when it crashed I would find myself in a position where it was actually a waste of money to mine unless your electricity cost was lower.
I didn't buy an ASIC, but the same thing happens with older miners that aren't as energy efficient that people run in their house. It's only profitable when the price is going up and the difficulty hasn't adjusted yet. When the price drops and the difficulty adjusts it becomes less profitable, so they probably turn them off (although not everyone micromanages this much).

Sure, on-chain transactions aren't free, but there's a huge difference between $0.01 transactions and $1.00 transactions.
I think I would target lower transaction costs than credit cards. Otherwise there no reason for a small merchant (not Amazon, but some random guy selling stuff on his website) to add a "Pay with Bitcoin" button. If it costs $0.25 + 1% to accept Visa, a $0.75 Bitcoin transaction fee + 0.25% exchange fee is bigger for $20 purchases.

That's my point, once you make a good amount on BTC you don't really care THAT much about paying taxes because it allows you to stop worrying about tax evasion.

OK, but most transfers are not for $1,000,000. The VAST VAST majority of transfers are lower amounts at which point the fees matter. Even if someone got a transfer for $0.01 through doesn't mean there's enough space for EVERYONE to get a $0.01 fee transaction through in the future.

Holding BTC is just as much of a gamble as selling it. It could have gone up after I sold!
So if I have BTC, it could go up or down. If I sell it for USD to "use a different currency" it might go up the very moment I sell it for USD. Or it could go down. Either way, I'm gambling. Might as well hold a lot of BTC and use it when I need to instead of selling for USD early while BTC is going up.
I mean, a few grand of USD is definitely useful to hold. But the rest of my money is going to be in crypto, equities, bonds. I don't want to hold too much money in USD which I know will lose something like 2% a year.

Not as much because there's a chance Bitcoin will die before 2024 because some other coin has better properties. So maybe 50% priced in for 2020 halvening and 25% priced in for 2024.

It's not going up 600% because the total amount of money in BTC is greater, so it's giving it a little bit more stability. I don't expect it to reach $3000 without correcting first.

If they only get as popular as Bitcoin, they won't because they don't have a 1MB cap, they'll just have 2-3MB blocks and they won't be full. It would just take more storage to run a full node.

That's why I said I can run my own node just fine even at 28.5MB blocks. Hell, if it's 2TB/month I wouldn't complain. Or I could just turn my node some of the time (when I'm sleeping or away from home) and catch up. I would only need to download the stuff I missed, I won't be relaying things to other nodes in the time when it's off.
So I can see 16 MB blocks working just fine. There's some head room.

There's no guarantee that one side will follow through. If you're going to do it, HF to two MB blocks and SegWit immediately. Then both go into effect at the same time.

It wasn't a pump and dump. The law change made futures contracts into options contracts. This meant that instead of risking 100 guilders on bulbs, the contractor would only risk the 3.5 guilders it costs to make an option contract.
That means that the people who lost money simply cancelled their contracts and only lost 3.5% of the nominal value of the contracts. When you consider the risk and reward, it's perfectly rational to risk only 3.5% on the off-chance that the bulb becomes more expensive.

We could have had 2 MB blocks a year ago.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:27:43


that's not true, you have to look at momentum
at every point there's a chance that it's going up and down, but it's not independent of previous events - if it's dropping, it's more likely to keep on dropping, if it's increasing in price, it's more likely to keep increasing
in other words, you shouldn't have a price in mind, but you should trade based on when momentum reverses - if the bubble seems like it's popping it's a good time to sell to decrease your losses
if the bubble seems to be growing, it's a good time to buy to increase your profits

Not really.
Current Bitcoin: deposit  ฿0.02 to Bitbucks and you can have coffee for a month (because Bitbucks passes on savings from CC fees to coffee drinkers!).
LN: Open a ฿0.02 channel with a hub and spend it on Bitbucks for a month. Close the channel because you ran out of funds but didn't get any back from anyone.
LN works best ONLY if you actually receive BTC. That requires you to be a trader or getting paid with BTC.

An algorithm that is "ASIC-resistant" basically requires an ASIC with a ton of RAM and a lot of instructions that can't be done in parallel. You can build an ASIC for it, but it will be not significantly faster than a regular desktop so it would not actually be worth it to build.

It wasn't even a big deal at the time since blocks weren't even close to 1MB. The spam I'm talking about is storing 100MB blocks in the blockchain just for lulz.

we're talking about nodes here, if you run a mining operation you shouldn't have a bandwidth limit
if you have a bandwidth limit use a thin wallet
I don't have a bandwidth limit and I'd be okay with transferring 1TB a month, which is 380 KB/s and which is 228 / 8 = 28.5 MB blocks - I'm not even a miner, I'm just a random residential Internet user

@_date: 2017-06-19 15:49:31
Yes, but up to a certain level of fees, you actually still get back money for just doing it yourself without any help. You just have to put in enough transactions at a lower fee level to where it makes it unlikely that a user's transaction goes through if they put it at that level. So users have to pay slightly more. Then, those transactions the pool operator did don't get included in the block anyway unless there are two blocks in a row in a short period of time. Since you raise everyone's fees, even doing it yourself can get you returns better than not doing it - you can do it without the help of other pools as long as you're large enough. If you're a large enough miner you can expect to pay the fee to yourself some percentage of the time.

Not really. We had a scaling issue where the DB would just stop responding after a small increase in requests (only 200 per minute and it would die). Throwing more devs wouldn't fix it, there was a bug with the implementation of persistent connections, so it wasn't solved until I looked at it myself. I had to temporarily disable them and we stopped getting issues.
It takes someone who is able to solve problems at that level to see where the bottleneck is and how to fix it. These kinds of people are missing at coinbase at every level, from support to management.

Yes, and we did run into the 250KB limit and had 250KB blocks for a little bit. The only difference is that we didn't have to hard fork to 1MB to increase it. In practice, the drawbacks and advantages of 1MB blocks vs. 250KB blocks are the same.

@_date: 2017-06-25 22:22:28
Well let's say 6 months pass, but the segwit blocks are not full. Then the prices increases and they're suddenly SUPER full. Do you think the core devs will all agree to raise it? All the miners agree to raise it? All the users upgrade at the same time?
No, we'll be stuck with full blocks for months before any change if history is any indicator.

As far as I understand, when you start broadcasting segwit blocks, old nodes can't understand them because they can't see where the funds are going. This means old nodes can't use segwit blocks either.

We know how increasing it works. We've increased from 250KB before. We also know how hard forking works. We don't know if LN will ever work on a large scale.

Are you really saying both chains will be as valuable? We'd be lucky if both added up to the current price.

That's why we should decide on a size increase later this year after SegWit activated.
We should get the USERS updated and have the miners not mine the 2MB blocks until enough users can accept those larger blocks. Just because the hard fork is going on doesn't mean the miners are FORCED to mine 2 MB blocks.

Every time that Bitcoin has been trading sideways, it precipitated another quick rise.
The last time there was a Bitcoin bear market, it dropped something like 3x over a period of many months. Considering how much larger its market cap is this time, I don't see any Bitcoins going for lower than $1000 in the near future. My reasoning for that number is purely psychological - people would feel that $999 Bitcoins are "cheap" because they are 3 digits.

Some of them stop, some of them don't. It depends on whether they have deep pockets. But you will see that the difficulty does adjust down. It's happened last time.

I'm expecting absolutely zero increase in price due to this event. I'm not sure why uncertainty in the future would make the total price increase. That being said, it could certainly increase to $3500 or whatever prior to it or after one chain wins.

WU doesn't care about inputs or any details, it's just $5. For some transactions it will be cheaper. If you have to transfer to an exchange, you'll have to pay again. You may need to pay the taker fee at an exchange, or take the risk the market moves as you're trying to exchange coins.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:40:02


I'm not, because I have more money in BTC than ETH. If ETH market cap exceeds that of BTC I'll be pretty bummed out that I didn't buy more when I could.

I would just switch to Ethereum if that were the case, because ETH actually increases its block sizes when it needs to. This solution doesn't scale, but it DOESN'T NEED TO FOR NOW.
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:08:47
It's going to be necessary eventually. Even with segwit and a functional LN, you still need to open channels on chain.

Then what happens if blocks are full in 2018? People will be trying to buy, but they will pay increasingly high fees, especially since you can't choose what fee to pay in a lot of exchanges.

I think then the only thing that's reasonable to do is both at the same time.

sounds like a good decision, they can buy back in for cheaper now!
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:40:01
it's okay, when everyone is on the segwit2x chain your core client will have to follow the economic majority eventually anyway
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:34:42
Or, like I pointed out earlier, if you got in at $2800, sold at $2600, you'd have more Bitcoin if you bought back in at $2400 again than just holding.
The only problem is then you'd have to know when you should sell before a further drop, because you could end up having to buy back in at a higher price point.
But you can't just say always holding is better. I'm actually getting cash reserves to buy in after a drawn-down.
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:42:42
I just downloaded the whole chain a few days ago. It got finished overnight. I also have Comcast in Silicon Valley.

I'm not selling any until ~3k or so. Then maybe again at ~3.5k and so forth. I'm not buying until bubble bursts and the dust settles and someone writes a Bitcoin obituary.

Same, bought at $24 in the middle of that fall.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:15:45
The problem is if core refuses to increase the block size further even if it's needed. If they wanted to increase the block size through a hard fork, why didn't they do it before the fees went through the roof?
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:28:08
if you had most of your wealth in bitcoins, then you'd have a good incentive to spend them, I'm sure the people who have 100K+ would find it easier to spend bitcoins directly than have to cash them out and take a fee

When I mined Bitcoin with p2pool I had to run my own bitcoind. That limit was in bitcoind at the time. The only difference is that clients didn't have to be updated. If core releases an update where clients can accept 2MB blocks in 2018, it would be the same because by that time enough people would have upgraded.

At a certain point all miners were mining 250KB blocks. Some people thought that was a better size. Luke-jr, for example, thought there was no need to increase the block limit to 1MB because it was all just spam. Sound familiar?
The "block size" debate goes back to 2013, with people complaining that 1MB won't be enough in a few years. Just read the thread.

The difficulty won't drop, if mining becoems 100x less profitable, then the "difficulty target" would be 0.01x
but the difficulty only drops by 4x each time
it would take 200weeks (4 years) to drop the first 4x
50weeks (1 year) to drop the second 4x increment
12weeks (3 months) to drop the third 4x increment
3 weeks to drop the fourth 4x increment
and only then could the network continue to function at 2 week adjustments
we've seen this in namecoin where the blocks took forever before merged mining

it's speculating in the short term, if you don't have cash at mtgox and mining costs you the same as buying (since you only have to pay electricity at the end of the month and the price could already increase by the time you get money on Mt.Gox)
but in general, I agree with you if it's more expensive
