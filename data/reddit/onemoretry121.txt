I think it's shooting through the roof and I can't buy it fast enough.

I'm sorry but I stopped reading after "and will continue until I profit". That's why you lost $20,000.

Hmm, what's the catch?  Can anyone with more experience fill me in?

The amount of FUD being spread here is ridiculous. Every time an exchange is unavailable, doesn't mean they're running away with the money. I was able to withdraw my coins 30 minutes ago just fine.

Sorry, but the price, more specifically the volatility, is an enormous factor in whether or not financial institutions and merchants will ever fully adopt it as a currency. I'm not worried about the volatility, the more capital that is invested the less volatility we will see, but the massive amount of volatility in the price is the sole reason why merchants are unwilling to hold Bitcoins and instead use services like BitPay to immediately transfer to fiat. Yes the price is all well and good for investors to turn a nice profit, but its also critical to its function as a currency.
You can't tell people to stop fixating on the price of gold and simply value it for its shiny, beautiful nature. Yea there are a lot of pros that Bitcoin the protocol offers, but the price is a big deal...

Don't know if you know this or not, but we're at $435, down 30% from last week. I'd say the sell off is occurring, and its dramatically impacted the price.

mstevenson10009 you just blew my mind.

Coinbase is on top of things, they've done an excellent job pushing out these features.

Hey Andreas, my comment was merely meant to address the masses who are satisfied with this spot-check. I believe your Coinbase review is very well written and does a great job at achieving its goals. 
Events like this remind us that we have a long way to go to achieve the kind of trust and security financial services firms are going to require before jumping in. And yes redditors, financial services firms can add a lot of value to Bitcoin given the right regulatory environment. I think this is a great start and I hope we get better as a community in demanding more transparency from these exchanges.

You really don't understand how this works OP...

I love Cups and Cakes, I make it a point to go there everytime I'm in the city. Their banana chocolate cupcakes are phenomenal.

I love Coinbase, I love what they're doing here, and I'm a fan of Andreas, but as an IT Auditor this "Peer Review" isn't even worth the storage its stored on. Comparing this to a SOX audit  that publicly traded companies are subjected to, much less money transmitters, is pretty entertaining. I hope this is only the first step of many.

Working as an IT Auditor right now in the technology sector. It's interesting to see how much work goes into a public audit versus a bitcoin exchange audit :D

0.2% fees vs. 0.5% fees = more bots and more trading per user. This plays a role in it, although it doesn't describe everything. You also have to look at the liquidity of fiat deposits, which also has a difference.

I hear Mt. Gox had vested interest in the success of Bitcoin too. Creating a central point-of-failure in a decentralized system is stupid. Just because they claim to be trustworthy, doesn't mean all of their employees are, or that they are immune to security breaches, or that they can't be bought out by a larger company with vested interest. Horrible idea.

BTC-e hasn't asked me to send money to them. I fail to see the difference.
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:17:36
Hmm, that's actually pretty cool. I will probably never use this feature as I find it much cheaper to transfer BTC from BTC-e to Coinbase and then withdraw via ACH, but I can see how this would be helpful to some people.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:53:14
Hmm weird I wasn't even aware BTC-E had frozen withdraws. I've been transferring out of there without problems lately.

Yea, definitely not worth enabling the API key.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:54:49
What's interesting to me is that everyone loves Satoshi Nakamoto's decision to remain anonymous, yet despises BTC-e for choosing to do so. There are pros and cons to being anonymous. Being anonymous does not necessarily make you "shady".

Wow, I usually have a pretty high tolerance for this stuff, but that guy is a moron.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:24:43
What exactly does Mt. Gox have to offer? $350+ million dollars of debt? Tarnished brand name? Impending legal cases? The only thing I can possibly think of that they could offer is their software infrastructure, which I would say is worth about negative $350+ million.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:33:15
Hmm, how about that. My $10.00 is now exactly $6.00. Brutal.

You could always get a visa giftcard  and use that. Put like $5 on it.

I had a question regarding this as well.  I recently bought Bitcoins and they haven't funded into my coinbase account yet, they won't until Friday.  Can I still sell them right now, or do I have to wait until Friday?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:06:21
Thanks for the reply, I figured as much, and I've done the verification but it still takes 30 days after the first transfer before instant transfers can take place.
