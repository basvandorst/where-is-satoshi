Not all miners will do this. Some people will - the miners that aren't selling their coins. I pay $100 in electricity to mine coins. If my mining becomes unprofitable, I'll pay $100 on the market to acquire coins. My goal isn't to sell my mined coins for immediate profit, it is to increase the size of my bitcoin holdings. Once I can't do that by mining, I'll do it by purchasing the coins on the market.

40 weeks isn't absurd - that's the way the Bitcoin protocol works. If 95% of the network dropped off overnight, it would take a long time for the difficulty to adjust. But assuming rational actors mining and no catastrophic event affecting all miners, there will never be a drop off that precipitous. I explain further in my other post. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:34:00
The first halving isn't the first time that mining has suddenly become unprofitable for miners. Back during the first big crash from $33 people were mostly mining with GPUs (no FPGAs or ACISs yet) a lot of people quit mining. There were some increased block times. But the major problem I see is with your thought experiment. 
You assume that everyone is paying the same amount for electricity. The reality is that electricity rates vary wildly around the world. 95% of miners will not shut down on the same day. They won't all become unprofitable at the same time. You'll see farms in places with higher electricity costs shutting down first. Maybe that will be 33% of the network. This will cause the next difficulty adjustment to take ~20% longer. This has happened in the past, it will happen again. I remember there being times that it took around three weeks for the difficulty to adjust. The reality of the situation is that most non-miners won't notice the difference. Variance is already a huge part of Bitcoin, and even when the difficulty is on the rise there are times when there is an hour or more between blocks. And guess what? The network continues to run just fine. 
A second factor will help mitigate this as well. Not all miners mine to instantly turn a profit. If I'm spending $100 on electricity per day to mine, and it becomes unprofitable, of course I'll turn off my machines. Any rational miner would. Now a fraction of that 33% that turned off their miners will take that $100 per day they were spending on electricity to mine coins and buy them directly. This leads to increased demand in increased price post halving. This raises the profitability of miners so that some can turn their rigs back on. 
While I don't think that a scenario like you described is completely impossible, I do think that it is highly unlikely. If there's anything that I've learned from mining for years it's that no one can accurately predict what the network will be like even a few months in advance. So there's really no way to accurately argue over the numbers here, but the network has already survived numerous situations like you're describing - massive crashes leading to unprofitable mining as well as a halving - and the network is more robust than ever before.

Much like everything that one altcoin or another has implemented - altering the difficulty adjustment to Bitcoin has been discussed by the core devs. What they said (and I'm paraphrasing from posts I read a year or more ago so please don't quote me) is that Bitcoin's protocol has been set since it began, and fundamental changes like that aren't going to happen. If it happens that an altcoin has a better feature set than Bitcoin, then the free market will have it's say and that coin will take over.

I don't see how using Bitcoin would be more beneficial to any of these criminal enterprises than a bank wire to an offshore account in the name of some fake corporation.
Bitcoin is not letting criminals do anything they couldn't do before, and to say otherwise seems to me to be just trying to spread fear about a new currency. 
The US Dollar is used in tons of criminal enterprises, and there is no way to track face-to-face transactions. On the other hand every Bitcoin transaction is recorded in the blockchain, making it possible to track the money used in any criminal activity if you are aware of the initial transaction. The idea that Bitcoin is anonymous by default is wrong.
Bottom line is that Bitcoin is faster and cheaper than the legacy banking system, with very strong decentralized security. Criminals get this benefit along with everyone else, but it doesn't let them magically commit crimes that they couldn't do before.
@_date: 2012-12-22 00:50:38
I would say that it is a clear risk vs. reward question. Typically the people that have the capabilities of pulling of these types of coordinated, well-thought out crimes are the types of people that have a significant amount to lose. A house, job, stuff, family, etc. Sure, in theory they could make a large amount of money doing illegal things, but would that excess money be worth the risk of losing everything and spending the rest of your life in prison?
Sure the risk might be less with a perfect payment system, but that hardly removes the risk completely. And with modern forensics and such, you'd have to pull off your caper perfectly not to be caught. The longer you do it, the more chances you have of being caught. So the question is if you've got the skills that would clearly be able to get you a moderately well-paying job to get you a house, family, nice car, gadgets and whatever else you want within reason, why risk it all? There is a reason the majority of crimes are committed in low income areas where people are desperate and feel like they have very little to lose. 
@_date: 2012-12-22 02:40:10
I really don't see an assassination syndicate as falling under the heading of white collar crime. I think it would be much easier for a CEO to rationalize embezzling a few million dollars than it would be for him to threaten to kill people if they didn't pay him off. The risks are typically significantly less for white collar crime as well, both in time served and the difficulty of the living situations in prison. So the risk/reward with white collar crime is obviously different than with violent crime or terrorism, as the OP is discussing.
Additionally feudal systems and mafias tend to operate in systems where they already control all or a majority of the power. In situations such as these a system which allows for perfectly anonymous transfers of money isn't going to make much of a difference. The important players will never be in a situation where they could be 'caught' with the money, they'll have someone else absorb that risk for them, or have influence or control over the authorities so that it doesn't matter anyway. States don't need Bitcoin or any other system to oppress their citizens, it's been happening for thousands of years, and will continue to happen. They have the power and the guns, they don't need to be anonymous.

A CPU miner will keep your processor pegged at 100%. This increases your electricity usage and your monthly bill significantly over idle. And it will run 24/7. That load on your CPU will probably shorten the usable life of the chip as well. Software that does that, without giving an option to opt out of installation, and without telling you what it's doing sounds like the definition of malware to me. Actually it sounds worse than most other malware.

I wasn't trying to say they're luddites or otherwise unaware/unwilling to use technological advancements to their fullest. But I feel that Bitcoin is one technology that for the first 3 or 4 years of it's existence fell through the cracks with the majority of people that heard about it. 


There's a big difference between people that have heard about Bitcoin, maybe used it a few times, and people that have been involved in the community and developing for the protocol for a number of years.


I completely agree, and your last sentence it pretty much exactly what I was trying to communicate with my post.

They have plenty of smart people who have been educated and employed in the legacy banking system. They are conditioned to think a certain way. And that has worked well for them. But it looks like JPMC is looking for people who have alternate ways of thinking based on the content of the job posting. 
Most of their employees probably heard about Bitcoin within the past two years, and have maybe done some surface research on it. It wasn't related to the projects they are working on. On the other hand, people in the cryptocurrency world who "are probably ambivalent about the prospect of working for a large financial institution" probably have 3-6 years of hands on experience with Bitcoin. 
I tend to agree with a lot of posters in this thread that ideas are worth very little. But with the gap of knowledge between someone who as been working with Bitcoin for 3+ years and someone who is just now learning what they can about it is going to be pretty large. So in this case I think the ideas are somewhat more valuable than in other fields just because of the way finance sector employees are trained to think.

This is one reason I don't use coinbase regularly. The other is that their fees are almost twice as much. While 1% doesn't seem like a lot, and it's certainly not unreasonable, it can add up after a lot of trades. Though perhaps the higher fee goes to pay for better customer service...

No, they can't. The majority of my coins are kept in cold storage. They don't touch the internet, and the only way to get to them is physically.

I typically replace what I spend immediately, unless its a small amount. But I buy in every two weeks when I get paid to slowly increase the total that I'm holding. I don't worry about a dollar or two difference in the price from day to day as I'm looking to hold bitcoins long term.

How would they stop it? Prosecute people who use it? How as that fared with stopping bittorrent? There's already a large amount of cash transactions for bitcoins, and if you're just a little careful it would be very hard for the government to track you down and prosecute you.
There's no central authority to shut down, and hypothetically if they tried to get ISPs to filter the traffic, Bitcoin could all be run through TOR. I feel that legislation against Bitcoin may slow down it's growth a little, but in the long run would just be a speed bump.

localbitcoins.com is pretty much the only way to get your coins immediately. It's worth a try, I was a little sceptical before I tried it but I make a couple trades a week in person now. I've never had a problem. 
As far as more traditional exchanges go, coinbase.com might be your best bet, as once you get your initial verifications done you can buy bitcoins at the current rate, and then the transaction takes 4 business days to process before you actually get your coins. Bitstamp might be best if you're in Europe, as SEPA transfers seem to be the best way to get money in there. Or CampBX is a US based exchange that accepts Dwolla transfers, money orders in the mail, and several other methods of adding funds.
Best of luck!

Difficulty just changed, which is now 86,933,018. The current network estimate is 630.9 TH/s. Your calculation is 216,666,667 GH/s or 216,666.667 TH/s or 343.42 times faster than the current network speed. So we'd hit breakeven at about 29,854,537,014.56 difficulty.

Basically the way it works is the network will recognize the longest chain of blocks in existence. So if you mine four blocks in secret while the network mines three, once you release your chain all the transactions that were included in those three blocks the network found would be invalidated. But for this to happen statistically and regularly you'd have to have either control of half of the current network or hashing power greater than the power of the current network.

This is all true presently, thanks for pointing out the numbers. I also believe there is talk of increasing the amount of transactions per block in the future, so I don't believe that will be a hard cap on transaction fees. I'm not familiar enough with the development issues to say whether it'll happen or not, but I do know it is being looked into for the future when more transactions are vying for spots in a block, so if Bitcoin becomes massively popular, the transaction fees per block could be much higher than the present technical limit dictates.
@_date: 2013-09-20 18:23:21
You could just pay higher transaction fees on your Bitcoin transactions. A lot simpler and it goes to the same place.
@_date: 2013-09-01 12:49:46
I don't think it's big players liquidating as much as it is that established users aren't necessarily buying $x per week. Many have invested in mining hardware, so they may be selling to recoup initial costs. Others are just watching to see where it goes. I have a few close friends that I've got interested in Bitcoin that aren't interested in buying or owning them, but regularly watch the price and happenings surrounding Bitcoin. 
But right now there are more people buying than coins being minted (or at least coins going up for sale), hence the major price increases we've been seeing over the past couple weeks. This will change when people who have been buying decide to sell if they feel the price has gone up too high, or feel it's the right time to get out. 
But in the end I think you have to look at the entire ecosystem. There are ~11.6 million bitcoins out there that at any point could potentially go up for sale. Not everyone is hoarding. A lot of people are in it to make a quick buck, or to buy something (which then the merchant most likely sells for fiat) or just have to sell their bitcoin to pay bills/rent or whatever. 35,000 mined coins a week isn't even half a percent of the total supply out there. I really think there are a lot of other factors to consider before I'd be willing to bet whales are artificially holding the price down.
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:45:56

@_date: 2013-12-31 04:38:29
From my understanding this is possible. The problem with this is that you would have to have a very substantial percentage of network power. The problem would be that while you're holding your block back - that block isn't the only solution. So your block could be orphaned, and if this happens you're out the block reward you would have gained and you'd be no closer to a second block than every other miner on the network. 
There was an article that discussed this issue a month or so ago, I'll see if I can dig it up. Bottom line - this isn't a serious concern unless a single entity controls a very significant percentage of the network power.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:31:31

To crash the market they would have to dump loads of bitcoins on to the market. Which they would first have to buy, which would cause the price to skyrocket. They they have to hope that the amount of coins they bought is enough to actually crash the price to worthless without the people leaping to scoop up cheap coins driving it back up to about where it started at. It's not a simple undertaking, and though it might succeed, it's also possible it would fail. This isn't a system that the Fed can just create money into to modify the price.

It's always painful to look back and have seen an opportunity for something and missed it. I can only suggest starting to buy in a little at a time now. Make a budget - start with your total income, subtract all your bills, and determine your disposable income. Take a percentage of that you're comfortable losing and set up a regular buy. [Coinbase]( will let you do that automatically. If you're not in a position of having much disposable income then just start with $10/week or month. That can be done cutting back just a little bit - one meal cooked at home instead of eating out or something else very easy to do.

Like a few others have said, the plan you outlined likely isn't feasible. However I think what you pointed out shows just how little Bitcoin still is. Despite the price compared to what it was a year or two ago, this is still the early adoption phase. If something happens that causes Bitcoin to be adopted even on a  small scale then, as show by past price explosions, we could see another huge rise.

The recent proliferation of ASICs has made mining Bitcoin with standard CPUs and GPUs inefficient and unprofitable.  Basically at this point the only way to get into Bitcoin mining is to purchase from an ASIC company.  This is really a gamble and may or may not end up profitable with the skyrocketing difficulty.  Most of the time it is better to have invested directly in Bitcoin than to have purchased mining hardware.  These ASICs cannot be used on anything else, so there is little resale value once they become  unprofitable. 
 One other option is to look into Litecoin mining.  It uses a different algorithm than Bitcoin that is still profitable to mine with GPUs.  You can then trade the litecoins for bitcoins.  Once again you're probably better off buying Bitcoin directly but you can build  a profitable Litecoin rig that can also be used as a powerful gaming PC.

It's quite different, because the dollar doesn't see the appreciation Bitcoin does. In many cases when there is a jump in Bitcoin prices, Bitcoin stock prices drop.

So I'll distill the main argument first so that you can correct me if you feel I'm replying to the wrong problem. In the beginning of Bitcoin coins were mined easily by anyone with a computer. The small amount of very early adopters were able to amass a large percentage of the total bitcoins that have been generated. Since a small amount of bitcoins are available on the exchange market today, if one of these early adopters were to liquidate all their coins all at once then they could drive the price to nearly 0, and destroy the Bitcoin ecosystem.
This isn't a new argument, and I'll list a few reasons why this is either unlikely or impossible. 
First, as pointed out by the poster, when these very early adopters were mining bitcoins, they were worth practically nothing. If you had something that wasn't worth anything for a few months, and had lost interest in it, what would you do? Throw it away. And that's what some of those people did. There have been a number of people that have posted that they mined a lot of early coins and either lost or deleted the wallet because they figured that the bitcoins would never be worth anything. So it's quite possible that a number of those coins (giving any accurate percentage is impossible) will never, ever move, because no one has access to them.
Second. Assume you were one of these very early adopters. You have more bitcoins than you can imagine what to do with. Would you rather sell all at once, crashing the market in which you are so invested, or sell slowly over time, getting as much fiat as you need, and still maintaining both the price of Bitcoin and your wealth in both fiat and Bitcoin. These people would be shooting themselves in the foot by crashing the price. They'd be getting less fiat than they could otherwise, and any Bitcoin holding they aren't able to liquidate just became worthless. It's the same theory as with nuclear weapons. No one is going to fire one because they'll be destroying themselves in the process.
Third. Look at the buying pressure currently on the market. The price has been driven up a large amount in the last two or three weeks. People are willing to pay well over $100 for a bitcoin currently. Now when the price drops, as we've seen in the past, some people will hold, and some people will panic and sell along with the trend. But there comes a point when people see these cheap coins, knowing that Bitcoin has seen prices of $200+ before, and knowing that there is a market emerging around this new currency, and they'll want to buy those cheap coins. Even if some person exists with a ton of bitcoins, and they're stupid/malevolent enough to want to crash the market by selling all their coins at once, it's quite possible that the market forces, seeing these cheap coins will save it's self anyway. Just head over to bitcointalk.org and spend some time in the speculation section and you'll see people wishing they'd be able to buy coins as cheap as they have been in the past. Drive the price down to $50 and people will be buying. Drive it lower and they'll be shoveling cash into Bitcoin buying up those cheap coins. And no matter how many bitcoins one of these early adopters has - it's a finite amount. Compared with the amount of fiat that is available to be channeled into Bitcoin by some of the bigger players, I think it would be very, very hard to crash this market just through the dumping of coins. And the market is only getting stronger day by day.
Hope this helped.

Those numbers are in Bitcoin. So your potential profit (assuming the difficulty continues to rise as it has been - and I've seen nothing that says it won't) would be .16 bitcoins by March of next year (~$23 at the current exchange rate). If difficulty starts rising faster than the estimates then even that profit margin could disappear. So the real question is whether a potential profit of .16 bitcoins is worth the risk of 4 BTC, and the hassle of setting up and maintaining the blade.
Edit: I really think that the time has come where mining is no longer going to be profitable for the vast majority of people. ASICs have already started coming down in price - the first incarnation of these ASICminer blades would have cost you 50-70 BTC just two months ago. They'll continue to drop until they're cheap enough that most people can afford to have one just to secure the network, and earn enough coin to pay the electric cost. But that's just a prediction. We'll see what happens.

But alt coins aren't dropping. They have the same value they had a few weeks ago, with the exception that Bitcoin is worth more than it was a few weeks ago. Look at LTC/USD prices. They've been pretty steady while Bitcoin has risen. When gold appreciates and it costs more USD to buy an ounce of gold we don't say that the dollar is declining.

Buying and holding. I try to spend bitcoins on different services that I see accepting them to foster the growing economy, but I always buy more to replace the ones I spent.

Transaction fees, which if the network continues to grow then so will the number of transactions per block and therefore the transaction fees per block. Transaction fees will probably exceed the block reward long before all the coins are minted.

Of the companies you mentioned I think Valve would be the biggest win for Bitcoin. It would at least get tons of visibility from the wide range of gamers Steam caters to. The humble bundle already accepts them, which provides steam keys, so it's a fairly logical leap that Valve could gain from implementing them. 
As far as the brick and mortar stores, I feel they'll be among the last to implement Bitcoin, as it's a large task to roll out a new POS system, and the benefits of Bitcoin to them at this point do not outweigh that cost.

That's why btc-e always has the lowest exchange rate. It's hard to get USD into the exchange, and every way of doing it has large fees. Coinbase, bitstamp, and campBX are all more reasonable.

None of the big Bitcoin hacks have had any warning or prior indicators. People have lost a LOT of bitcoins by keeping them on exchanges or other places they didn't have direct control over them. You'll be better off in the long run keeping them in a secure wallet you control.

This is because there is no way to actually measure the hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network. The charts are based on guesses based on how fast blocks are found. So when there's a lucky period it looks like the hash rate has gone up, and opposite when there's an unlucky period.

Every listing on that feed is either buying at BTC-e (impossible to get USD into without huge fees) or selling at MTGox (impossible to get USD out of) or both. There's a reason why the prices are so low and so high at these exchanges, and trying to take advantage of these "opportunities" will likely lose money overall.

The only way I could see the algorithm ever being changed is if SHA256 is compromised. If that's the case the ASICs aren't going to do miners any good even if they don't switch.

Bitcoin, obviously. PPCoin because it isn't just a copy of Bitcoin with a different variable - it incorporates proof of stake which could be huge in reducing electrical waste in the future of crypto currencies.

It's still wasteful, you just don't have to pay for the waste. I'd recommend trying to provide any goods or services you can offer in exchange for bitcoins. That way you get coins and help foster the economy along the way.

I don't use Facebook much so if I'm off on this please correct me. But Facebook privacy limits who can view any persons wall (limited to their friends or whatever). So there would be no way for the bot to see the the tip message and process it.

I think more are kept in cold storage than you might think. It's become a common way for all bitcoin businesses to operate after the few high profile hacks of the past couple years. Most individuals with large bitcoin holdings are also quite careful with them - it is a large amount of money and people are apt to protect it. Even if they're not kept offline, encryption keeps them safe.

It would essentially be a new coin. People could accept either old or new coins, and both forks could be valid.

A lot of the traders there have a ton of feedback, and most likely some of their orders were larger than yours. Of course it's always possible to get scammed - at which point I'd suggest meeting in person to make sure you don't get scammed. I know I'm always willing to take a trip out of my way for someone who's buying a lot of bitcoins. Or you can use an exchange that you feel is more trustworthy than a trader with a lot of feedback.

I'm replying to this because an upvote is simply not enough. People are waiting for product they ordered almost a year ago from this company. Please, in the Bitcoin world as anywhere else, do your own thorough research with any company before you give them your money.

While this sounds like it would work in reducing chargebacks to virtually nothing, that's probably because you won't get customers willing to jump through all these hoops. The amount of effort a customer has to go through to be able to buy bitcoins this way completely negates the ease of use of the credit card. They might as well just sign up with an exchange - at least they wouldn't have to go to a notary for that.

Pruning the blockchain is something different. That refers to removing certain transactions that are no longer relevant in order to reduce the overall size and make storing the full blockchain more manageable.
What you're referring to is something that has been discusses before, if coins don't move for a certain length of time then they get thrown back into the pot or removed completely. It's is inherently a bad idea because it hurts Bitcoin as a store of value. It makes long term storage impractical. Want to start a cold storage for your newborn's college fund? Better move those coins periodically or they'll be lost. What happens If you're sent to prison for 30 years? Should you lose all your coins because they haven't been moved while you were in prison? It's counterintuitive to the concept of accumulating wealth and currency. Bottom line is someone mined those coins, and no one else has the right to take them away. That is one of the great things about Bitcoin.

Right, but that is IF we see ASICs that use 0.55 W/GH. To my knowledge none of the shipped asics are anywhere near that efficient. I believe KnC miner which is a 28nm process is claiming 1.6 W/GH, and they haven't delivered any miners that I'm aware of to verify this. I believe Bitfury is claiming 1 W/GH using a 55nm process. So there's still a lot of room for the difficulty to rise, but I don't think we're quite as efficient as can be yet.

I'm in the Boston area, I'd be willing to sell you coins in person for cash.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:04:37
To my knowledge that is mathematically infeasible, and if it's not then it would completely break Bitcoin. So I could go mine for private keys, what's to stop me from finding yours as opposed to someone who lost their key? How do I even determine who has lost their key and who hasn't. It wouldn't take long for people to completely lose faith in Bitcoin if their balance could just completely disappear from their wallet. Luckily using current computing technologies and cryptography, this isn't possible.
Not to mention that brute-forcing private keys would not be hashing on the network, so they would not even be mining.

Right, but he could have used the cash he bought the Jalapeño with to buy bitcoins at the time. Whatever coins he bought would be more than the 7 he mined. So having used the USD to buy the jalapeño was still a net loss. The currency used to purchase the hardware is irrelevant.

I think this would be sending the wrong kind of message to people new to cryptocurrency. You're trying to make Bitcoin fit into the box of credit cards, and what we are trying to do is show that Bitcoin doesn't belong in that box, and we should all be free of the box. The membership date, valid until date, and not valid unless signed space on the card are all laughable. These things don't apply to Bitcoin, and to put them on a card will only confuse people. 
In addition, having this sort of card and claiming it is fully usable is false. So I ask someone to pay me for something, let them scan my card. Then I either have to trust that they sent me the correct amount (not a good idea) or pull out my phone to verify the transaction. If that's the case, why didn't I just pull up the qr code on my phone? Quicker, easier, and one less hunk of useless plastic I have to carry around in my wallet.
Anyone that might have use for this would be better off spending their money on a cheap android phone or tablet to do their bitcoining with. We as a community need to stop trying to fit Bitcoin into legacy banking's shoes, and focus on what makes Bitcoin different and the situations in which it is more advantageous.

It definitely is possible that the hashrate growth slows down by then. It'll have to eventually. I just wanted to make people aware that the continued difficulty growth may well continue into 2014 as we see a lot of new chips and devices being delivered in the next few months.
