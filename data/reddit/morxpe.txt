Very nice converter, but I think you still need CNY, EUR, PLN, JPY, GBP and HKD.
For Polish złoty (PLN) conversions you should use: 
[pln.bitcurex.com API]( ([here's the ticker](
Polish Bitcurex is in very good arbitrage in relation to Bitstamp (taking into account the costs of conversion to euro). It is the most trusted and convenient exchange in Poland, which is why it is commonly used for conversion rates.

That's pretty common knowledge here, on Reddit, but in media mtgox is still their major source of pricing. That's pretty funny actually, it is not as difficult to cross $1000 mental border or legit exchanges (bitstamp) when it crossed on mtgox already. 
Mtgox just keeps pulling other exchanges through many milestones. So i guess.. thanks MtGox? now you can go back under your rock.

Yes. And that was several months back. Although it is hard to imagine how couldn't they notice such a leak. It means they were not monitoring their cold wallets vs their books (balances on the exchange software).

Problem is, you are assuming there are no other, inflating, national currencies. When you take that into account, production in country with bitcoin-based economy becomes too expensive and uncompetitive. Exports die, imports increase rapidly, local companies suffer, and the country quickly becomes dependent upon other countries. Local economy dies and unemployment goes through the roof.
If you would like the limited-supply currency to work, you need the cooperation of all countries in the world, or the awareness of employees what is the real value of their wages (adjusted for inflation). None of this is possible, At least for now.

Well kinda. High interest rates causes more deposits and lower consumers activity. But you can easily lower interests rates and increase consumers activity when the economy needs it. 
When we're talking about deflationary currency, with a limited supply like Bitcoin, there is no way to influence consumers' activity. Hoarding is always prefered option, and there is no value added in this (no progress for society).
I mean, there is progress, but supposedly slower. And less stable.

You are wrong. 
In the unofficial, leaked Crisis Draft they are talking about 624,408 bitcoins missing from customers acounts and 120,000 from MtGox account. This sums up to 746,408 btc. 
Than they're just saying 80,208 BTC of these customers' funds were linked to banned accounts, and they probably wouldn't have to return them (hence the negative sign). Again, it's unofficial, internal document. [Here is the balance sheet from the leak](
In [the official document]( there is MORE bitcoins owed to customers (750k) and LESS owed to MtGox (100k). They're not saying anything about any banned or suspended accounts' funds.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:29:23
[Here's the statement.](
The "+" sign is correct, this is a balance sheet. 
The exchange owes: 
- 624,408 BTC to customers
- 120,000 BTC to MtGox (investors? employees?)
This sums up to 744,408 BTC
This amount is reduced by 80,208 BTC probably from the amount recorded on accounts involved in exploiting the malleability (they're basically saying they're not going to pay these customers back).
It clearly states all they own is 2000 BTC from the hot wallet.

maybe at first
but I think most of these coins would just be moved to cold storage for owners to enjoy full control once again. And when funds get to cold storage, people are too lazy to withdraw them and trade some minor price jumps. They'll also realize the risk involved in keeping coins on exchange to trade.
So in the end funds that used to be traded regularly, will now be hoarded.

From what I understand from the draft:
- they have been exposed to the malleability leakage for a long time (months or even years) 
- they kept supplying hot wallet balance with their cold storage bitcoins (could have been happening half-automatically -&gt; software requests funding + physical confirmation from an employee)
- they didn't notice their bitcoin liabilities to customers (the balance of customers' bitcoin deposits) can not be covered by what they were keeping in cold storage. (POOR ACCOUNTING) until they did and halted BTC withdrawals.
- It was too late, their cold storage bitcoin wallets were drained.
And as it has been reported before ([an early explanation of what was going on]( they were clueless about real reason of MtGox not beeing such a good business anymore. They were allegedly modifying transaction fees to make it profitable again.

Is there any open source licence code selling software integrated with bitcoin?
Like: you load a database with premium codes of some sort and sell it through your website for a set ammount of bitcoins each. 
Someone buys 1 code, pays in bitcoin and after X confirmations the licence code is send to e-mail address. Fully automatic.
If not, would it be difficult to create something like that with a super simple, basic interface? I think it could boost bitcoin utility through the roof.

To make sure your ID wouldn't be used for loans etc. within EU just call ANY bank and report that your ID has been stolen. They update international database and nobody can use this ID for fraud.
Negative aspect - you need new ID.
I also had my ID in MtGox. For now I'll just wait to get more reliable confirmation that it has been leaked. Seems unlikely that they've been storing this on the network... but who the hell knows, it's MtGox. :/

Love the idea of Darkwallet. Can't wait to use it. One of the most anticipated projects of 2014/15:
*    Darkwallet
*    Toroken
*    BitWasp
*    Storj
*    FrostWire's team projects of integrating bittorrent and bitcoins (paying for content, paying for transfer etc.)
*    Trezor (so close...)
These are the projects that will soon shape the everyday reality we live in.
This is why Bitcoin utility will soon go through the roof (and so will the price).
Finally, these are ideals I believe in, and why I believe in Bitcoin.

1. Is it possible for a malware to modify a bitcoin address you copied? e.g. when CTRL+C to replace every string of 27-34 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1 or 3 to the hacker's bitcoin address? And how could this be prevented?
2. Is it possible for a malware (especially browser extensions) to replace address string and QR code graphic on the payment site of popular bitcoin payment service providers (coinbase, bitpay)? I know that in a Chrome browser it is very easy to modify anything that a website is showing after it is loaded (simply modify code and it looks 100%  legit). Bitcoin payment services usually show the QR code, bitcoin address and the ammount (there is no form). Than they observe blockchain for confirmation. 
3. Electrum bitcoin wallets use 12 words from English dictionary to create "seed". Knowing this seed gives you total power over all addresses in the wallet (no BIP38 encryption). Knowing that the list of words Electrum uses is limited and probably available in its open source code, how difficult would it be for an attacker to recreate all possible combinations of 12-word seeds and than scan them for balances? I guess when you have all the seeds, than you generate all the available addresses and compare it with blockchain?

*Bitcoin is "not a currency" because it doesn't meet the criteria of a currency*
Agreed. It doesn't fit today's definition of a currency. It has some similarities but in the same time is very different. 
*...including being a store of value*
Can't agree on this. It does store value. Right now it's utility is higher than many assets Warren owns. And this utility grows every single day. A simple implementation of micro-payment revenue system in bittorrent network (only months away from implementation) will boost this utility through the roof. And that's only a one single branch of bitcoin-related development. 
Warren doesn't grasp it, but I can't blame him. That's a nerdy subject. My position is based on facts he apparently didn't acknowledge. I wish him all the best in the business he can wrap his had around. He's a good guy.

IRS news are actually... bad news. 
The fact that every bitcoin operation is taxable (in theory) significantly decreases its utility as a payment method (in theory). Price drops are due to risk that real usability of bitcoin for legal business might become non-existent.

it's [HADOUKEN]( 
I think that's what the name was inspired by, as it is equally cool.
Toroken concept was basically to make TOR with option to pay the NODES (people who provide some of their internet connection to TOR network). To pay them Bitcoins according to how much internet speed they share with the TOR network. Payment would be volountary, but if you pay, you get priority access. Also, you can become a node yourself and earn shiny bitcoins.
Idea is to compensate the sacrifices nodes have to make sharing their connection, and to feed geeks greed (get some shiny bitcoins m8). It would make TOR much more popular and therefore way faster.

Being a shareholder means literally part-ownership of the company. Your profits are dividends - company's profit generated per share. Good condition of the new company would be in best interest of large part of the bitcoin community. That ownership would give them the opportunity to get involved in creation,  maintenance and marketing of the new, re-branded  exchange.
It is risky, but I can't see other way out of this. 
Right now the only other option seems to be: you get nothing back.

Once you buy bitcoins on your exchange of choice, on Polish side of the transfer try using bitmarket.pl exchange. The btc/pln exchange rate is the best you can get as there is very good arbitration with bitstamp USD exchange. Transferring money out to polish bank account is less than 24 working hours. There is also an option of instant transfer (in 2 minutes on your bank account) for 5pln.
I'm not associated with bitmarket.pl, just honestly recommending the best Polish exchange there is.

When they deliver all pre-orders and when they have another batch ready to send. I know, this sux, but that's what happens when consumers have to deal with a monopoly.


If I understand it correctly, the hardware wouldn't allow any external software to access private keys used for signing transactions. 
When the transaction is signed within the unit and comes out ready to broadcast, and than is captured by a keylogger-like malware, there is not much a potential attacker can do with it. (except maybe change it's ID but that's not a big deal in this case).

**Make it possible to pay for extra speed.**
like: I want to pay 0,005 for this 500 MB file
For every 100 MB of your upload you receive 0.001 BTC
Than the person who has the fastest upload gets most BTC. 
 downvoters, please consider that once a real value asset is involved in bittorrent file sharing process it would be considerably easier to implement a content-creator gratification.

Just like ASICMiner shares, but instead of dividends you receive whatever is left from MtGox. 
**How about:** offer ASICMiner-style shares where every share represents 1 bitcoin of MtGox liability, but instead of squeezing whatever is left from old exchange, let's just get together and create a new exchange (I'm sure community will help). Profit goes to dividends.
All you need is MtGox database. No relation with MtGox or legal authorities is needed. Just let people claim these shares by some available mean of verification, and let's get this baby going.

Cloning bitcoin and making this new currency a "token" for all ebay purchases can be a very smart move from ebay. They can make shit load of money, and if they'll make it open source they can convince bitcoin miners to join their network.

In fact usd value is the only thing that matters here. 
ASICMINER chips pricing is in dollars, even if they sell them for bitcoins. 
Selling 100 chips, $0.99 each gives you ~27 satoshi or $0,0002/share, share price is ~$630 now.
Also they no longer get 50% of their profits in bitcoins from mining, now they're less than 1% of the network (used to be 30-40%).
Last divident gives you a raw example of what their mining earnings are: 0.00026655 = $0.25 / $630 share.
Let's assume they'll manage to make it a dollar per share dividend when the sales starts. 
That's an ~8% profit a year for shareholders, which is pretty shitty taking into account all the risks involved.
And  a dollar per share assumption means more than 300.000 chips sold every week...

It is very difficult / legally unclear to operate in bitcoins in most countries. You can't keep your books in bitcoins. There is more risk in holding bitcoins than fiat (despite from what h4x0r anarchists say). Volatility is a cost. 
Clear legislation has to be in place for any serious business to consider doing that.
Focus on lobbying for clear legal situation for bitcoin. 
Other than business - just use an exchange.

What I mean is that you can't accept bitcoins or any foreign currency "exlusively" (in most countries). This is because your country needs to ensure the utility of the national currency - it is necessary to conduct an effective monetary policy.
 I won't bore you with details, but there are some solid, rational arguments behind it.
Oh, and Visa / Mastercard transactions are settled in local currency by your bank. I meant national fiat / cash is what you're obligated to accept.

I think we might be close to some break-throughs. "InPay" is a company working on implementing BitPay-like payment system. "Automater.pl", leading licence-code selling service, is thinking about bitcoin as well. Unfortunately both of these companies are strugling with legal issues. 
Right now we have no bitcoin-specific regulation to work with. Wide adoption could be only possible if there is legal clarity and Poland is far from there.

In the  process of bankruptcy debts are cancelled.
There is no hope for depositors to get what they used to have on the exchange.
Mark is a respected member of bitcoin community known for acting in favor of bitcoin users (bitomat.pl takeover etc.).
If he decides to re-create the exchange and if he wants good PR for making up for those who lost their bitcoins, it is plausible that he will make a "special" offer for these people.
Shares are one option (legally possible) which means part ownership of the new company. It means that a huge chunk of bitcoin community is involved in maintaining this new exchange, because its in their best interest. It means special care from Bitcoin Wizards (Andreas and other developpers) it means free marketing (solidarity of community).
I wouldn't rule out this way out. Bitcoin markets are small and they need the gratitude of the community to be able to function.

Does it work just like a kickstarter? You crowdfund the public leak?
So there has to be someone who decides whether or not information is legit?
I mean... without someone verifying the legitimacy of the info before the official, public leak, it would immediately become a scammer heaven.
Make a deal with Julian Assange (or someone equally trustworthy) and make him proof-sign leaks. Although I'm not sure if Assange would go for allowing leaks to become something you pay for... it's no longer that noble.
When it comes to crowdfunding music etc. it's entirely different story. It seems like intellectual property reinvented. New rules for the modern standards of close to zero marginal costs of digital content. 
* Artist decides what the price of his/her new album is. Let's say 1 mln. 
* Artist's album gets confirmed by a trustworthy third party 
* Crowdfunding page is set up and people pay for album to be released
* Once it's paid for, it's immediately moved to public domain. From then on anybody can copy / download / share the album.
I think it's a more moral approach compared to what we see today.

If you can't use coinbase (not in US) set up standing order in your bank account to automatically transfer set ammount of fiat to a bitcoin exchange of your choice once a week.
Most exchanges will inform you that you received new funds by e-mail, so it will work as a reminder that it is time to buy some bitcoins.
Also, as soon as you buy bitcoins, transfer them to cold storage or Trezor (lesson learned after MtGox collapse).

I agree. To go mainstream, bitcoin needs Bank-like institution:
* to guarantee the safety of bitcoins stored within
* 100% clear legal situation (institution must be serious)
* internet banking-like interface 
If bitcoin will be recognized as a legitimate CURRENCY I think it's more likely that BANKS themselves will offer bitcoin accounts, like they're offering accounts in foreign currency. It is far more likely that your mom will trust her bank rather than some confusing software.
So our main goal should be: MAKE BITCOIN LEGITIMATE CURRENCY IN YOUR COUNTRY
First step is to make bitcoin exchanges as legal and transparent as possible. I think it can happen within a year, since in EU we've got KRAKEN coming, supposedly with a clear legal situation in Germany (therefore in entire EU).
There is also a promising Buttercoin project that can be a game changer ;)
Ah, this will be a very interesting year for Bitcoin.

I'd get rid of these ASAP... The network hashrate is increasing ridiculously  fast. Use ebay or craigslist and get your money back when there are still some bitcoin noobs trying to make an investment of their lives... 
In my opinion - long-term, mining should keep the price of bitcoin on a stable level, just a little above the average price of energy-per-bitcoin-mined. 
Therefore: 




This is how free markets work. And distributed, bitcoin mining network is probably the "friest" market you'll see in your entire life. ;) 
All benefits of ASICs:




Contrary to popular belief, in long-term, ASIC-based bitcoin mining industry will not make the network any less energy consuming than CPU- or GPU-based network due to increase of mining difficulty (to the limit of "bitcoin price/energy cost = 1").

Not every country has a capital gains tax and they're doing just fine. I think bitcoin is going to show governments that taxing it is very ineffective and they will eventually seek taxes somewhere, where they're harder to avoid - like Value Added Tax on products.
Anyways, the fact that Israel is trying to tax it is actually very good news, because it means they're not going to ban it.

I wouldn't recommend it either. I'm just saying there are people who are OK with it and this is how the arbitrage is done (mtgox-bitstamp). 
The premium varies, usually 10-20%. Since there is almost no risk in arbitrage, it most likely represents the risk people are willing to take withdrawing from MtGox (4 weeks+ of frozen funds).
Of course there is a possibility that nobody really performes this arbitrage as described, only speculators assume that this 10% premium would be a fair price for the extra risk involved in MtGox. The Invisible Hand of Free Market takes care of the rest ;)

I recommend Electrum. It is super light and powerful.

You can also use Electrum as a cold storage on your offline USB linux system. It supports offline transactions.

Of course it didn't matter. In EU it works like this: If the bank is Italian (Headquarters in Italy), it's under Italian financial supervision. 
It doesn't have to be supervised by any other authority of any other EU country it decided to make business in.
But it doesn't change the fact that it's Slovenian government who decides about politics and whether or not they want Cyprus 2.0. Slovenia is independent when it comes to legislation. 
Of course "seeking outside help" is still far from wealth confiscation and Bitstamp users should not panic. Most EU countries were/are/will be asking European Central Bank for help during the crisis.
**tl;dr Slovenian Unicredit branch is under Italian financial supervision, but under Slovenian legislation so it is "bad news". But don't panic, it's far from "very bad news".**

Partially ASIC effect - roughly 18k new bitcoins a week when MtGox depth is &lt;255k (for offers at and over $10/btc). It couldn't last forever.
I think now the trend will continue its down rally as miners will exchange their bitcoins immediately instead of hoarding it. 
From technical analysis the next resistance point is $50.01/btc. But unless something really big happens (positive) I don't think this wall will last long.
In long term the price of bitcoin shouldn't fall below average mining cost. This barrier will be driven higher and higher with increasing difficulty (more Watts per btc mined). All significant increases above this value should be considered hype and speculation.
As the difficulty increases quite rapidly investments in bitcoin should still bring quite decent profits. In the same time mining business will become more and more of a charity work with a small margin of profit.

Although I have to admit that I've received a withdraw from 13 June a little bit earlier. Maybe they're prioritising first withdraw of each account in queue?  
Anyway, I don't think it's fair. 
I really don't think they're limited to a certain number of withdrawals. It seems more likely that they have a set daily amount that they can transfer out. 
Also, I am not sure if there is any regulation that might put these limits on them. BZ WBK SA (the Polish bank they are using for Sepa) is not a small player. It is a part of Spanish Santander Group. SANTANDER is the biggest euro-zone bank, 9th biggest bank in the world. They shouldn't have any problems with processing MtGox's Sepa transfers.
What I'm saying is, if they don't have any limits set by the bank or by Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) it is very likely that their withdrawals policy is set internally, within MtGox itself. Now that would be very suspicious because it could be a signal that MtGox operates as a Ponzi scheme founding our withdrawals with their new clients' funds. With $5 mln of their cash frozen, I wouldn't say this is impossible.
Right now all this is pure speculation, but I'll try to look into KNF's and BZ WBK's regulations (I'm from Poland). If I find anything suspicious about MtGox's transfer policy, I'll make sure to let everybody know.
@_date: 2013-08-19 07:31:04
FIFO (first in first out)? I do not agree. I received some of my later withdrawals weeks before the earlier ones. I think they prioritise smaller withdrawals.
**example:** 160 EUR withdrawn on 16 Jun has been received on 9 Jul, but the 175 EUR withdrawn on 11 Jun has appeared on my bank account just recently, on 13 Aug.
All were SEPA transfers within one country (from MtGox's *BZ WBK SA bank* in Poland to mine *BRE Bank SA* in Poland) so it takes 3 days tops from the moment it's proceeded to the moment its received.

Cool proposal, but... Dollar bills and coins do not represent all dollars in existence. Cash is just the form of paymant for common people. When Ben Bernanke is "printing", he actually create digits on accounts. When Wall Street is trading, it's moving large ammounts of digits from one account to another. This virtual cash does not have "serial number" until it's actually printed for Banks, for all the Joe Does - clients who withdraw their money from ATMs all over the world. Financial institution rarely touch bills.

It would be wise if you describe bitcoin as a new payment technology rather than a currency. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't find many enthusiasts of a currency with a limited supply... especially in government body of EU country. 
I think the first step for Government is to regulate bitcoin exchanges (unfortunately). They can make local exchanges collect client's data so the taxation of potential profits might be possible in the future. 
The second (simultaneous?) step is to specify the nature of Bitcoin. That is decide whether they see it as a financial instrument, a currency or something else. By doing that the Government can subject bitcoin to the existing law or it can create a new law to regulate cryptocurrencies specifically (more desired but requires more work). The point is to make bitcoin users aware of: which taxes (if any) and when are they obliged to pay when they trade crypto.
When it comes to tax avoidance this shouldn't be an issue when it comes to legally operating companies, as they usually want to stay clean. Just make it obligatory for them to register their account on the bitcoin exchange if they want to accept payments in bitcoins and it should solve the problem.
IMO bitcoin is inevitable technology improvement. Cryptocurrencies, just like torrents, are unstoppable, therefore it is the Government's duty to adapt, not the opposite. The time to act is now. If they won't regulate it properly, soon Bitcoin will live its own life bringing a lot of trouble to the rusty regulators.

So there was a dog called Weiner but he wasn't a weiner dog. One day Weiner says to his owner: "Andrew,  you've been good to me. Let me start in a dog race and I will win it for you. ". Andrew was shocked but he agreed. It was the first time ever Weiner spoke to him so he fought it must have been a sign. So he signed up his dog for a race. He sold his house, took credit and all the money he could get to bet it all on the Weiner's win. So the day come and Weiner who wasn't a weiner dog is waiting on a start line all pumped up and ready. The shot was fired and the race begun. Weiner run as fast as he could, he run, run, and run. And then he falls down put his paws in the air and freezes still. Andrew runs towards him. He falls on his knees and asks Weiner: 'Weiner! What happened?'. Weiner looked into his eye and replied 'I don' t know Andrew. I don't know. '

MtGox used to post this information on their Twitter account. Also people on reddit knew where they were in a queue when they applied so they posted it in this sub.
