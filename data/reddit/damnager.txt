I will actually place the qr code more in the middle for the us bill.. the private keys are hidden inside... foldable design. i also made debit card design foldable and different types of currency
Here is debit card design:

It is clearly an issue.. you should not be able to open a wallet with another wallets application... they should use a kind of signature which binds to the blockchain and the method used...  you can be lazy about security.. i am better over protective and i know how stupid trustfull people can be when they don´t know about a thing.

In short it is like giving the same bitcoin for example to as many people you want while it isn´t even bitcoin and everybody can set it´s own password, just not sent anything. The blockchain and the bitcoin-qt client will say it is  there and this gives a false feeling of trust which some people could count on.
Also swapping it for an application will result in a virus detection sooner or later, a different wallet.dat never.
In this example i copied a bitcoin wallet in the namecoin folder...  it just shows 0.00NMC because this was the actual balance.

if these coins pretend to be your coins... then it has to do something with you.. why not? Running it on the different blockchain just gives you the coins for free... now you whould have to use an old namecoin client to generate such address...
