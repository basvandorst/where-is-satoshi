You invested into BTC without accepting that it could go back to $0 ???
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:14:29
It isn't about buying a dip - my point is any investor should be aware of the risk of BTC becoming valueless. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:28:12
Nice research. 
The only subreddit that occurs on is where it is all satire and a joke. Walk over there for 2-3 minutes, and you could have noticed that (or also realized that those posts only occur on that subreddit).
Even my closest real life friends know about and post on that subreddit. It is a joke, and no one there truly means harm to anyone but themselves (very self-depricating, **you will see plenty of comments on there where I call myself retarded, an idiot, stupid, etc**).
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:47:17
My point was that googling "quote about contradiction" doesn't make the contradiction I pointed out any less retarded.
I've come to the conclusion everyone on this subreddit is blind with ignorance, and borderline religion freaks about BTC.
This subreddit is a joke compared to other investing subreddits (even crypto-focused ones), and all of you are worshipping a god you don't understand. No discussion, and very little willingness to talk about the weaknesses of BTC.
What a sham.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:25
It's fine. A lot of people on this sub are quite toxic, but I understand quite a few other people here aren't blindly following a religion, and - like you - have a lot of grounded logic and reason. 
Why do you think BTC isn't going to fall wayside to someone else improving the blockchain technology? Plenty of other cryptos exist and better ones can be created as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:26:56
Right, but why? 
I don't care what happens **if it happens**, I care **how it is guaranteed** or even highly likely. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:35
Any younger person that invests "more" (as in more assets in crypto over stock) is taking too much of a gamble, and I've never met one in person. I'm 22 and know a ton of people who have both. No one I've met puts anything more than 10% in crypto.
And nothing you said counteracts my point. Even if your logic is based on other stuff, you still just cited the past. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:03
Assuming a majority of bitcoin users got in within the last year, can you then call it a success in such a short amount of time? 
A success would be, to me, reaching a point where Bitcoin cannot be criticized and has actually achieved what it set out to do.
No one is currently going to be using bitcoin to buy stuff considering the f-ing price makes the phrase "highly volatile" seem like a sloth doing a 5K while Bitcoin is in a rocket ship that could blow up any minute. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:20:40
Quote from a fictional drug dealer... Quite ironic in the context of Bitcoin. A philosophical quote isn't a counter to the joke of your logic. 
You contradicted yourself in less than two sentences.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:14
Seems like a typical response to any criticism ��
If only this weren't disgustingly accurate to how little discussion truly goes on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:12:04
I meant proof that alt coins are all based on Bitcoin's source code.
Blockchain is a concept beyond bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:40:26


Yet you intended to leave out that part? That's literally contributing to the issue of spreading misinformation. Leaving out that critical piece of information makes the host look like an ass (to anyone who didn't watch the video), and unfairly puts Chamath in a brighter light than he deserves when that specific segment really only had him saying "it's about confidence" and "an idea." 
If anything, the host was spot on to call him out on that, yet your initial comment tried to flip that. That's pretty annoying on a sub-reddit that should be encouraging total truth and clarity in order to understand how bitcoin works.




Interesting, amusing, or not, that isn't the main point here. None of that actually contributes to the argument on either side of the discussion, and that idea won't be worth shit when BTC collapses (if), and no one cares. Comparing BTC to the USD is digustingly simplistic in a community that tries to act like it is simply better... not more of the same.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:05:42
Wanna give some proof of that? 
Being the first mover is not a benefit when a new technology is taking off. It will be improved upon, and already has been multiple times.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:37:54
It's good to understand the technology (and I do as block chain has been relevant in my non-financial field), but I would still be mentally separating the technology from Bitcoin itself. 
That said, a lot of people use their currency (e.g. USD) without understanding how the system works.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:24:10
That would be different, and matters in stocks too. First off - **past performance has nothing to do with the adoption of technology** especially when something like BTC could be a fad. 
Second - it would be different if BTC had something that made it unique beyond being a first mover in a technology space. That doesn't matter much in the end when a technology is adopted and improved upon since BTC literally can't be improved. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:40:44
It is your job to back up an insult, otherwise that just makes you **an asshole.**
Also, how can you insult me **two more times** without seeing the irony in your own words? I'm ending this chain of conversation as I don't feel like communicating with someone like you. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:43:41
Seriously. I found the sub, and within 30 minutes I decided half of the people here are toxic little kids acting like assholes with anonymity. I'm a little disgusted by what I found here.
Little to no discussion - mostly pseudo-religion-level worshipping. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:19:52
What the fuck are these posts? I come into this subreddit for an hour and I see a circlejerk of you people just sucking each other off for being early. 
Isn't the whole fucking point that (1) you want to to become standard and used by everyone, and (2) grow, meaning that small amounts of bitcoin like this are still a good investment? 
Makes no fucking sense how you guys laugh at this, and it shows you have conflicting opinions and ideals. If anything it's laughable how poorly scaled Bitcoin is since the only way to talk about it will be saying "$Xxx USD worth of BTC" since anything under 1 just sounds retarded. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:29:22
Are you a prophet? There is zero guarantee with BTC
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:30:26
Care to point out what specific ignorant and/or incorrect statement, or is this just going to be another response with no grounds?
What a fucking joke of a subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:16:28
You seem like a fucking idiot if you think BTC can replace someone's career. 
I know someone like you who thinks making $100k on Crypto this year means he's successful and never has to have a job again in his life. 
Except $100k is nothing for someone who is truly successful and earns it through blood sweat and tears, and it is decent for a 1-year salary. Does everyone here really think that growth is going to be sustained? 
I'd ask you to be a little more cautious if you're that blindly following BTC as a path to the promised Land. If your goals are truly using BTC as a get rich quick scheme, you really have no fucking clue how it's supposed to work. It can't be useful and volatile, and if it isn't useful, it won't be a good investment.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:23
I'm not saying either of you are wrong in what you're saying being true, but implying past performance has anything to do with the future (in investing specifically) is one of the biggest mistakes you could make. This is a rule to live by in stocks, yet something that crypto investors use as justification. 
It's bad logic.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:24:37
You compared it to stocks in multiple ways now. Is this a joke?
Also, you can literally download an app called Robinhood and buy AAPL. So that's a fallacious statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:21:59
Why? You have nothing to say that actually counters it, just an insult? Lol...
e: YOU ACTUALLY UPVOTED THAT COMMENT HOLY SHIT HUMANITY IS DOOMED LOL
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:38
You aren't evaluating Bitcoin like a stock, but compare it to Apple two seconds later..
 For real?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:19:25
Exactly my point. You **believe** in a digital deity because it is speculative. 
Also, don't be an asshole or insult people. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:21:18
How you heard about it isn't my point.
My point is that realistically no one else would share your perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:23:55
I don't think value going up over time is an issue, but anything over a consistant 5-10% would screw up a lot of things, including the stock market. BTC can't be both an investment vehicle, and a currency, so there is a paradox there that will likely be solved by a bubble in either situation.
Can you expand on your point about protocols and email? I don't follow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:18:47
So no real response, just an insult. got it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:15:04
&lt; if you were around long enough like me to wonder if Bitcoin could ever be worth $1
So, like 3 people?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:45:06


Yes, that's what stock ownership is. Holy shit, I didn't even finish the rest of your comment after reading how little you understand about investing. No wonder you're in BTC - you probably don't even own stock and are ignorant enough to put 100% of your investments in it.
I'm out of this sub after my 30 minutes here. You are all insane.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:37
I never said I wasn't invested, nor does my personal investment have to do with my point. I'm also understanding that the market and people are irrational. That is a law I live by. 
However, I'd say "first inning" is a joke. This is the first step of the bubble when we look back on it. 
Bitcoin is more of a digital deity that we put faith in than it is anything we say it is (currency? What a fucking joke. Who is actually planning on using BTC as currency when the price goes up? Only a huge ass bubble burst can actually get us there). 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:39
He called it a confidence game himself. That's literally a fucking con game, Google it.
Don't act like the reporter is throwing something out of left field with shitty quoting - you're literally doing a worse job than they are. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:55:21
How, though? Who is currently using BTC to make purchases at the level of volatility it is seeing? 
It isn't as simple as "the same, just cheaper" when there are way more complexities to it. 
I understand the analogy you're going for, but your shaving analogy was purely on price. There are way more factors in this situation.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:30:10
Yet everyone here says "be willing to lose any money you put into it" going against the whole other point of what he's saying. 
Not to mention, how the fuck can BTC ever do what we want it to do if no one trades it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:37:24
He did zero research. I'm only "toxic" on a subreddit where the entire sub is a meme and everyone acts like that. It's likely an enjoyable and funny sub for anyone here.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:36:13
Degrees are about knowledge, not authority. 
Do you realize that you can learn nothing without those who know more than you, and come before you? Our species would be dead without the passing down of knowledge. 
You sound delusional in your outlook at the world. 
Also, a "new world" doesn't have to include BTC. The "future" you speak of could be any other Cryptocurrency or even one that isn't created yet. Why do you think I'm on this sub if I don't understand the impact of blockchain on the future? 
**Blockchain =/= Bitcoin**
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:00:55
The point was that no idiot is evaluating the dollar as a store of value like gold. 
Well, it appears some idiots are. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:18:39
I hope this is a joke ��
