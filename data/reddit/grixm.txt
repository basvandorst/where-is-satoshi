Let's be realistic, we can't expect retailers to give discounts for bitcoin users. We must be willing to pay in bitcoin even without any discounts, if not it doesn't look very attractive for the businesses at all.

Well they are. It's a fact that there are more blockchains than bitcoin and that blockchains can be used for more than bitcoin or even money at all. Bitcoin is by far the biggest blockchain right now and is used for the most applications but this is beside the point he is making.
Kalukhov's quotes are informed and accurate.

It's not a "scam site", localbitcoin is a serious and reputable website with over ten million dollars trade volume every week.
Of course it is possible that individual sellers are scammers, like on any site, but if you buy from people with positive feedback and use escrow the chance of that is tiny.
If you wonder about the "national bank" thing, why not just message the sellers in question and ask what they mean by that?
@_date: 2016-04-23 11:45:30
I think national bank means any domestic bank. So if you just have a bank account and can send the money to the sellers bank account in the same country, that's enough.
There are also sellers that do cash trades in person, so you don't even need a bank account at all.

I am a miner myself, and I don't really appreciate being lectured on what my own motives are, by some guy who's never even met me.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:24:22


Right now no implementations of bitcoin would hard fork without a clear majority of recent blocks, so I think this fear is overstated. If there is a hardfork, it will be because it is supported by the majority. "Contentious" is a strong word, there will always be a minority of people against any kind of change, they will simply have to yield, or create their own coin to their liking. Because it's impossible to respect everyone's wishes.
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:06:47
Yes. In short, nearly any kind of spending requires some personal information, like a shipping address for an order, contact information for services, bank accounts for currency exchanges, etc. The moment he gives up that information in some trade that can be linked to his bitcoin wallet, he can be identified.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:41:01
I didn't laugh at him, but I disagreed with it, and still do. Because first of all, it's way too short of a timeframe. Never mind 6 months, never mind two years, come back in **10-20** years and if bitcoin still hasn't set proper foothold, I will admit it probably never will. And secondly, it's not about price. Bitcoin could crash to $5 and although it would suck to lose money because of it, it won't falter my belief in bitcoin's success. Bitcoin is a tool, as long as tools do what they are meant to do, it doesn't matter what pricetag people put on them, they are still useful.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:32:39
The price have actually been briefly outside the $220-240 window recently, so it cancels out
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:51:48
Not true. Big processor manufacturers is likely to wait a while until yields are better, they are in no hurry. In fact, TSMC is happy to let companies like KNC, who care more about being quick to the market than production quality, practically beta test their fab.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:59:11
But that is the wrong question to ask. No, you may not be able to link a wallet to a specific IP if the owner is taking proper precautions. But, does this mean the owner of the bitcoins cannot be tracked down? Absolutely not. The weak point is actually spending the bitcoin. That is hard or impossible to do without potentially exposing yourself. And what good is bitcoin if it is never spent?
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:40:11
Why is this determined by the partner? Does 2K have to actively say "No, don't let the customers pay with bitcoin" or have they merely not said anything and the default is no?

@_date: 2015-06-06 20:40:57
I wasn't as offended as it might have sounded, I was trying to prove a point, that some miners, while money is a nice bonus, care enough for the network that they would continue mining even if the reward were to drop to near zero. So you shouldn't generalize.

There is. They would have to be extremely careful not to leave behind traces that can be tracked, especially if they are converting the bitcoin to fiat. Plenty of people have been caught doing bitcoin-related crimes, for example the infamous pirateat40.
Here's a demonstration of how bitcoin, especially large amounts, can be tracked even through tumblers: 
If one random guy can do that, imagine what the feds with all their resources can do in tracking people down and following the trail. No one is perfect, the cryptolocker guy(s) must have made an exploitable mistake some time.

Some more info and numbers:
tl;dr KNC currently owns around 10% of the network, around 4000 Thps. Some of this might also be KNC's customers running on their hosted pool. Not quite 466k USD/day at today's market prices. 
I'm a fan and two time customer at KNC, but this irks me a bit. In their [FAQ]( they state that they will never mine with more than 5% of the hashrate they sell, but this is clearly not the case anymore.
However, I disagree that they are mining with scrypt ASICs. There is no reason to believe that they have working scrypt ASIC boards ready. If they had actually received a batch of chips and started mining for themselves the difficulty would have increased a LOT more than 80% in a month.

Sales are actually going very well. It is clear that bitcoin and lasers are quite overlapping niches :) Even though I also accept paypal, most customers pay in bitcoin. Every month I get more and more customers too, regardless of the price going up or down.

It may not sound like much but this is not my full time job, I have barely paid for any advertising or anything.

That's where you are wrong. They DONT threathen you with physical violence including guns, handcuffs and placing you in a cage for such crimes. At worst it's a fine, and if you refuse to pay they just seize your assets. Whether it is wrong or not is irrelevant, it is certainly not VIOLENT. No one is physically hurting or even threatening to do so to anyone.
OH AND BY THE WAY:
Being pro-state, or "statist", is NOT THE SAME as supporting laws like this. You are not arguing against statism, you are arguing against unjust laws. Completely different. This is a democracy, if you disagree with how the state is running things, run for government yourself and change it.

Many other companies are like this too though.

I think China's announcements' effects are very exaggerated in this article. They imply that the bubble crashes in December was China's fault, but I don't think that's the case. They were simply that: bubble crashes. Maybe the announcements from China was part of the trigger, but they are not at all responsible for the full 50% drop. The price was overvaluated, it had grown 1000% in just a few months. It was bound to pop sooner or later, China or no China, just like earlier in 2013 and in 2011.

Perhaps not immediate and practical benefits, but certainly benefits. For example, by using bitcoin you alone control your own money. And if more people used bitcoin, businesses would save on fees and chargeback fraud and pass the savings to customers by lower prices. And you could send money fast and cheap to anyone on the planet with an internet connection while solutions like paypal and western union are not available in many countries and cost a lot. 
It's a chicken and egg problem, the big benefits of bitcoin will come when more people start using it, but many people don't start using it because there are no big benefits.

This is fucking stupid. It's just semantics. Sure, I guess if the police taze an armed murderer in self-defense it is technically violence, though 100% justified. And as said many times, my country has a very low rate of police brutality. I live in Norway, we didn't even shoot Anders Behring Breivik, remember? He is sitting there in his comfy cell in good health. Normal police don't even carry guns. Most years you could count the number of police shots fired in the whole country on your fingers.
And as said this is all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. The state being violent does not make me violent. This whole pointless argument started with a guy calling all statists violent. I am not violent. I support the state, yes. But I do not support all aspects of the state. And even if I did, supporting violence is not violence.

You can get power for 30-80 øre per kilowatthour depending on location, provider, plan and not least season and recent weather. But in addition to that you have to pay "grid rent" which goes directly to state owned companies that builds and maintains the power grid, it consists of a flat rate of around 1650 kroner per year and another 35 øre per kilowatt use. It's kinda complicated and volatile.

A green laser is probably best for astronomy, as they are the brightest per milliwatt. The very best would be the 520nm green lasers because they are more stable in lower temperatures and has a better beam, but a regular 532nm would work fine too.

Pretty much any laser on the site could pop a balloon and light fireworks, perhaps except the weakest green lasers without a magnifying glass.

I would not be happy to receive a tip of 100 dogecoin. It's not even worth the effort to reply to the bot to accept them. It's dust. Worth practically nothing at all.
However with bitcointip it's a different story. The bot itself warns people that tips of less than 50 cents or so might seem rude instead rather than good (which I certainly agree with). The average bitcointip is far higher than the average dogecointip. And you can actually use the bitcoin, even in small quantities, for example by buying reddit gold for $3.99.

Imagine this: If you had spent 15 million dollars developing a product, but the raw parts for the product only cost $100, would you sell the product for $150? Of course not, you'd never make back your investment with that tiny profit margin. Now imagine you sold enough of these products at a much higher price and finally got rid of your debt. Now would you sell them for $150? Sure, you'd be making a profit and have no other costs to worry about anymore. 
ASICs doesn't cost that much per unit, but the initial NRE is huge. BFL have now sold enough machines to cover that NRE (partly because of the previous generation sales), so they can now start selling machines much cheaper and still profit. They might not have been able to cover the NRE if they had prices their machines at $2000 from the start, so they chose not to because of the risk.
Another point is that ASICs are actually worth less the more time passes because of the difficulty, so it's actually quite reasonable that a machine that cost $5000 costs only $2200 a couple of months later, even ignoring the economics.

I mine interne regnskap noterer jeg balanse og bevegelser i to separate valutaer, bitcoin og dollar. Men min butikk er såpass liten i omfang at den ikke er registrert som foretak. Bitcoins som veksles ut føyes til den totale profitten i kroner og rapporteres på selvangivelsen. 
Men for deg antar jeg at du ikke har leverandører som aksepterer bitcoin og dermed vil foretrekke at bitpay/justcoin betaler ut i norske kroner med en gang, og da er det ikke noe problem med regnskapet. For hvert salg vil du bli betalt i kroner akkurat som ved kort eller kontantbetaling og kan føre det opp i regnskapet på samme måte.

I use bitpay for my small business in Norway, it works well. Right now I get paid directly in bitcoin, but there was a time I requested payments in NOK via domestic bank transfer so I know it's possible. Beware that there might be some hidden bank fees though, if I remember correctly the fee between the price and the bank settlements were slightly higher than the advertised 1%.
However, a better choice might be Justcoin payments. Justcoin is a norwegian company itself, they are mainly an exchange but they just launched vendor tools for business owners to integrate into their stores. I think their fees, especially hidden ones, might be lower than bitpay, and I think you'll get better support and help with setting everything up as the owner is quite actively trying to recruit vendors and help them. The only problem is that it is still in beta.

I do not think law enforcement fits under the description of violence. I can't speak for other countries, but here police don't go around shooting people committing infractions, or even hitting them with batons, that would be illegal in itself. There are laws I disagree with, but if I break them (and get caught) I will be met with a piece of paper demanding I pay a fine, or at the very worst jail time. That is not violence. The only time police in my country uses violence is when dealing with a criminal that is violent himself, and that is just self-defense.

I still believe in fiat currency, for the foreseeable future I think bitcoin will be a way to transfer money, not a currency to replace the state's. 
There is one more reason too. What I don't like about the state is the meddling in what I do with my spare time or money (except taxes). We have many oppressive rules, like you cannot buy or use drugs, or play poker online. Bitcoin allows us to easily bypass such restrictions.

It depends on the region. In the US where it has been on many talk shows etc. I imagine it is relatively known, but where I live it's pretty unknown. The majority of people have never heard of it, much less know what it is. But of course some have, and they are often a pretty loud minority.

I don't mean to rain on the parade, but as a vendor this is not how it appears to me.. Most months over the last year or so I have averaged around 5-10 bitcoin sales a month. But recently this number had dwindled. Last month I think I had 2 or 3 bitcoin sales. And this whole month, only a single one, and that was a very small one. All other sales were in paypal. I haven't really done any more or less advertising and such these months, so I can't really explain this in any other way that it is directly related to a shrinking active bitcoin spenderbase.
And to add to this theory, another vendor that I've talked to that exclusively accepts bitcoin, also said business has been very slow lately.
Hopefully it is only temporary.

I think 7% is a way low estimate. There was a whole year or two where mined blocks were a dime a dozen and I think more blocks than not were mined by someone who randomly downloaded a wallet to test and then forgot about it, until the private key was eventually lost. 30% sounds about right to me.

It is not one scam in particular, there are many. The whole thing is quite elaborate, part ponzi, part pump-n-dump and part fraud and lying. 
GAW miners is likely operating on a deficit and using funds from new customers to pay out older customers, not actual mining revenue. This will eventually collapse and payouts will stop, leaving especially new customers with a big loss.
Then we have paycoin, which was pumped using broken promises such as "the price will be backed by us with a floor of $20" (the price immediately fell below that at trading launch). Anyway, the thing is that the coin is 97% premined, meaning that josh owns 97% of all coins in existance. So the only reason he is pumping the value is to cash that out for himself, taking the money that others put into the system.
These things, plus his trading platform paybase, probably shares cashflow in order to keep each other afloat and looking healthy for as long as possible, but it's all a facade. And there are more, like past scamming on ebay and shilling for his companies or against competitors, etc. In general too much to describe in just one post.

As I said, I experienced the problem with bitcoin-QT. So yes, it IS happening, not just to third party programs. Stats don't really mean jack shit compared to reports from the actual users. It doesn't help to tell me that "No, it's doesn't happen, the stats say so", when it did happen. It still happened.
And like it or not, third party services are here to stay, bitcoin is programmable money, you can't expect all users to stay on the official, naked client. Users will and do use third party services, often with delays to withdrawals and transactions, and payment invoices need to account for that.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:27:03
A bit of an exaggeration I think. Last word I can find is this: 
0.1% of the sales is not a lot, but it's still an order of magnitude more people than you could fit in a classroom since HB gets hundreds of thousands of sales every bundle. And that was two years ago, bitcoin commerce has increased quite a bit since then, especially in the third world.

I disagree. Even if what you're saying is true, (which I don't think it is, people have different tastes when it comes to looks) a product like glass is hugely useful in many cases even when you are not in public. Basically it lets you get information no matter where you look even if your hands are busy. Just one example of when I've really wished I had a glass is when paragliding, being able to display variometer and GPS data in the corner of the vision like that is very appealing.

It being the logo of the bitcoin core app does not make it official. It just means that someone some time decided to make it the logo and no one objected. 
This is actually one of the main benefits of bitcoin.

For me the scary thing about option 1 is not fees going from 0.01 to 0.02 dollars (by the way we are already past that point, most of my transactions have fees close to 10 cent or more). The scary thing is that the number of transactions simply exceed the max capacity. Because as of now there is a max capacity, where it is no longer possible to just pay a higher fee or to make more efficient transactions, but where the backlog just keeps rising indefinitely and some transactions simply won't ever get included in the chain. If so it won't become a fee market where the fee to get recorded to the chain is higher but constant. It would become a bid war spiraling out of control because more transactions are important and wants to outbid the competition than the blocks can hold. Until the fees are so high that bitcoin becomes useless for any purpose.

It certainly has enormous benefits. For example, he has had control over like a million dollars worth in bitcoin that came from donations to bitcointalk. Short of just pocketing them, he could spend them on pretty much however he saw fit, and there have been a lot of criticism over how he did choose to spend them (mostly on development of a new forum platform that doesn't really have anything to do with bitcoin and serves who knows what purpose when there already are so many forum platforms out there).

In my opinion it is important for the success of bitcoin simply to prove that it can handle a hard fork and multiple parties with separate opinions regarding development. Therefore, in a way I wish for a hard fork just for the sake of a hard fork to see what would happen. If bitcoin fails as a result, maybe it simply wasn't worth protecting in the first place. If a hard fork, even one that needs a clear majority of mining support to trigger, is a danger, then bitcoin is fragile. A fragile monetary protocol is pretty worthless.

What is the transaction ID? Just a fee doesn't really say much, it's the fee per transaction size (in bytes recorded to the blockchain, not number of BTC sent) that matters.

First of all, calling the biggest competitor for a "coin" is already pretty misleading, it's not really meant to be mainly a currency like bitcoin is. But the rest you said is wrong too.

I believe the blocks will eventually become full at almost any size. If there is room in blocks, new transactions will probably choose to be included in blocks rather than go through higher layers like the lightning network etc. Only if the block size is restricted and minimum fees go up does this become undesirable. This is of course assuming that the popularity of bitcoin and demand of transactions continue to rise, but there is no signs of this stopping. Even if genuine user transactions not being common enough to fill 8MB or more, if there is room in blocks leading fees to be low, it will be practically free for spammers and bots to fill the rest of the space, so they will.


Storing the entire blockchain doesn't necessarily mean storing every transaction ever made. I mentioned higher layers like lightning network. I think most of bitcoin scaling will inevitably happen there, meaning it doesn't permanently occupy drive space for full nodes. But storing the root settlement transactions would be as important as ever.


That's a very acceptable disadvantage considering its benefits.


8MB was just an example. If you argue for big blocks, why stop anywhere? It comes down to: restricting block size and let the growth happen in higher layers, or not restricting block size and let all the growth happen in the root blockchain. If you are a fan of the latter, 8MB won't be nearly enough. If bitcoin or a similar cryptocurrency becomes as popular as I think it has the potential to, we'd need blocks hundreds of megabytes large to cover every transaction. Maybe even gigabytes. I don't think it would be doable for the regular joe even if accounting for the drop of storage prices per year.

You are speaking of bitcoin purely as an investment method. I think the people who say to hold forever are more interested in bitcoin itself, they expect it to grow to the point where you never need to cash out because your bitcoin *is* your money, that you can spend on stuff as you would have spent the fiat if you had it. In that way you can't compare nvidia stock to bitcoin: stock (unless you own enough to influence the company of course) is only useful if you cash it out because you can't do anything with it on its own, however not so with bitcoin.

I don't think it's that simple. For example the block reward is decreasing, when it approaches zero and only fees are left, there is far less incentive to mine as now when accounting for any price difference. And fees likely won't provide enough reward to keep a huge mining network by itself, because the bulk of the growth would happen in higher layers like lightning network, not directly on the blockchain which would press fees up. Even if the bitcoin price increases to like $8 000, but there is maybe just 2 BTC reward per block, that's hardly twice the reward as today so the mining network won't grow more than twice what it is today.

8 MB blocks for the next ten years results in 4.2 TB blockchain.  8 * 24 * 6 * 3650 = 4204800
What is "too high" is subjective but of course it's not a controversial opinion that higher block sizes = higher total blockchain size.


And as explained, at that point it's too late. It is much, much better if you don't have to buy any other harddrives just for bitcoin at all.


Not all users need the whole blockchain, but some do. If we let it degrade to the state where only datacenters will bother storing the whole thing, we lose a lot of decentralization.

As I said not now, but you can't predict the future. With the advance of deep learning I can quite easily imagine a system being developed that lets law enforcement scan a person's entire crypto transaction history and having it automatically flagged if there is laundering involved or not, with just a click on a button. Unless you just keep the bitcoin forever, in which case there is no point in even owning them, there will almost always be a way for the government to link your identity to the stash. If this technology happens, they will definitely find the time for it, because it would generate far more revenue via caught tax evaders than it would cost to perform.
@_date: 2016-12-15 13:57:31
The wonders of cryptocurrencies (at least the good ones) is that they are transparent and verifiable. Anyone can look at transactions and verify that they are legit, and anyone can look at the code or documentation of the wallets and protocol to see what makes it tick. Just look here  , under "Latest transactions" you can see bitcoin transactions in real time as they are broadcast on the network. This is what made its price rise, people saw the potential and began to use it.
Now what about Onecoin? It has nothing like this. There is no proof it even exists, and even if it does exists it has none of the advantages of bitcoin because you can't verify transactions, you can't look at the code, you can't do anything. It's smoke and mirrors. It comes down to: You can actually use bitcoin. But you can't use Onecoin. If he owns all these tokens, ask him to do something with them to prove that they exist. Transfer some for example. He can't, and if he doesn't understand how that makes it an awful "investment" I don't know what will.

If we increase the block size too much, todays harddrives will be unable to store the blockchain soon enough. A blockchain of several terabytes within a decade is not out of the question. Also hard drives don't last decades so you can't future proof that long in the future anyway, you'd have to pay multiple times as your storage device dies. And even $100 is too much, most people don't care to buy extra hardware to run a full node. If they can't do it on their home PC, they won't. This goes double for people in poorer countries that actually need bitcoin more than us in the west. 
I myself have two SSDs and only 80GB free space at the moment. I recently had to prune my blockchain because I couldn't justify storing the entire thing.

Game theory says that the miners won't be able to work together to reject low fee transactions. If there is room in the blocks, it doesn't cost miners anything to include any transaction they can into the free space, and if there are some low fee transactions waiting, that's free money for miners, no matter how little. If everyone initially tries to reject txs below a certain fee, there will be much to gain for someone to break that rule and accept lower fee txs. Then the others will see this and lower their limit to get a piece of the action too. Then the first guy will lower it even more and eventually there is no min fee, every transaction with a non-zero fee gets included in a block eventually. Because even one satoshi is better than nothing.


Can you explain why it is a false dichotomy? I get that most people want both scaling of core blocks and higher layers: I do too. However I still believe that to avoid the scenario above, the block cap needs to be low enough to cause full blocks on average.

@_date: 2016-12-02 10:44:22
Before doing this, verify that it's not just a problem with propagation. If you can see your tx in your wallet, but not on sites like blockchain.info, then the fee is not the problem, rather the transaction was never transmitted to the network in the first place. You can resend it by right clicking on the tx and getting the raw transaction (at least in Core), and then pasting it for example here:

There already is a solution: thin clients. At this point running a full node with the whole blockchain is only really meant for enthusiasts or service backends. If you are a regular consumer there isn't really any need to, just use electrum or something and you won't have to download anything (almost).
And no, for full nodes the blockchain files won't go away any time soon. They really are the backbone of bitcoin and it's absolutely necessary that at least some of the nodes store them in their entirety.

Europe has had some progress when it comes to law recently.

Well, for one he probably meant trust with the personal information. When paying with credit cards, the site and your bank can collect information about your spending habits or personal infomation and sell/share these with third parties you might not want, like advertising companies etc. Many legit sites do this, it's rather common actually.
And also, if the site happens to be full-on scam, with bitcoin the amount you send only will be lost. But if you pay with credit card, they can actually empty your entire card, not just the amount you originally planned to pay. Also, they can sell the credit card and personal information to other sites and have them withdraw money and abuse your information too. It's a whole lot messier.

True. But then again, escrow and chargeback services can be built on top of bitcoin. With credit cards you have no choice. That, to me, is actually one of the most strong points of bitcoin. It doesn't force any high-level features or complications on people, the protocol only provides the basic token transfer functionality, and encourages services to expand this to fit their own specific needs perfectly. This is actually what made the internet (TCP/UDP/IP) so successful, it only provided the basic data packet transfer functionality, and all other services like WWW, VoIP, chatting, streaming, gaming, etc. could be built on top without any restrictions.

Well, look at these guys for example: 
"In the past, we weren't able to sell and ship to international customers due to issues of payments and fraud. With bitcoins, we are able to expand ToyDemon products to customers all over the world."
Clearly bitcoin has a significant advantage when it comes to fraud in some cases, as these guys were simply unable to ship worldwide because of too much chargeback fraud from abroad before bitcoin became available.

There is a command for rescanning the blockchain.
Go to the shortcut to your bitcoin client, or make a shortcut if you don't have one. Then right click on the shortcut and select properties. In the "Target" textfield you should see the path to the exe. Just after that path, add this text: -rescan .
So it looks like this for example: 
Then start the shortcut. Now bitcoin core should rescan the blockchain at startup for missing transactions. This will take a while.

It may have been purged from the mempool. In which case the money should be back in the original wallet. But that wallet might not realize that the transaction failed, so it assumes it's gone. I don't know what wallet you are using, but maybe there is an option to either rescan the blockchain to see your true balance, or re-transmit the transaction.

On their site they say over 4 million BTC have been won on their site. Assuming about 50% win/lose ratio, that's about 8 million BTC bet since the inception.

@_date: 2015-07-09 11:51:52
Yes it does. For one, raising the block size would lower the fees and thus make spamming the blockchain cheaper for an attacker. Also, it allows for much larger single transactions that can cripple the processing power of nodes, a 8 MB transaction can take several minutes for a node to process, during which time it can do nothing else, it's like a DoS

I just explained it to you, jeez. Let me say it again:
Things bitcoin can be used for without obligatory "fraud protection": **A lot**
Things bitcoin can be used for *with* obligatory "fraud protection":  1,  and only *kinda*.
Using bitcoin DOES NOT mean you "decline" fraud protection. If you want fraud protection, bitcoin *does* offer it, as a higher-level service. But don't shove it down everyone else's throats as mandatory and ruin tons of other uses in the process. That goes against everything bitcoin stands for.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:06:57
Yeah, there's trouble. The first transaction was indeed sent without any fees at all. 
Blockchain.info still says the transaction is "high priority", and the priority keeps going up as the transaction ages. But unfortunately the network is under extreme load right now, so while the transaction will get confirmed eventually, it might take some time.. Sorry.
As for the second transaction, it does contain a fee. However, looks like the wallet tried to spend money from the previous transaction, so it can't get confirmed before the first transaction is also confirmed.
Are you using the most recent version of bitcoin core? (it's not called bitcoin-qt anymore) If not, first upgrade and the fee should probably be better calculated next time. These days you probably want like 0.0003 btc/kb if you want fast confirmation.
I know there used to be a site where you offer an additional late transaction fee, a bounty of sorts, for miners to confirm your transaction, but don't remember the name and can't find it, sorry.

People do offer bitcoin fraud protection. Here is one: 


You asked if/why I think it is a good idea that bitcoin does not offer fraud protection out of the box. Although it may be better for this specific scenario, I am saying it is incompatible with bitcoin in the big picture, using other uses as a reason why. And I am suggesting that even for this specific use, trading, bitcoin is better off without built-in fraud protection because of the modularity.
And also, consumer fraud protection is actually controversial, because fraud goes both ways. If chargebacks are possible, then customers might not get scammed as often, but now businesses can be scammed by the customers, which drives up prices and affects other innocent customers negatively.

Yes, I definitely think it's a good thing. Bitcoin with obligatory chargeback possibilities would be so much less useful. Sorry if I sound condescending now but it sounds like you don't entirely "get" bitcoin. *Bitcoin is not a way for people to pay for products.* That is merely one of the ways to *use* bitcoin. Bitcoin is a protocol, and it is meant to be as basic and fundamental it can get, because basic means full of possibilities. Basic means expandable and modifiable. Basic means free of restrictions.
And paying for stuff is far from the only use, just like Skype is not the only way to use internet. If the internet protocols had some needless complexity to make it better to use for Skype, like being required to send skype login info with every packet, you can imagine how uninteresting it would be. It would be useless for anything else, like the world wide web. Similarly, allowing bitcoin token transfers to be reversible at the protocol level, would make it completely useless for many other purposes than paying for products, and in fact for certain cases of buying products too. Instead, the way we have it now, people can build chargeback services on top of bitcoin, and if people want that when paying for something, they can use it, and stores that use it will win "marketshare" due to capitalistic mechanisms and it will become the standard. But not enforced because it's not always the best solution. That is the best of both worlds, and the magic of bitcoin is allowing that.

I just wish they wouldn't be so quick freezing people's accounts. For example people buying on DNMs or gambling.

Since there is no human owner of the car it can't keep a paypal account, or I think any other major payment service, because the account needs a human with a real name and personal info to be legally responsible for the funds. With bitcoin anyone, even machines, can use it because they don't need permission. So it's necessary if the car is to be completely autonomous.

Accepting bitcoin is not really risky at all if you:
1. Don't trust third party services with your money. If you have to use exchanges to convert the bitcoins into regular money, do it fast, don't use the online wallets as storage. With all the hacks lately, this is aksing for trouble.
2. Try not the use bitcoin as storage either unless you are willing to risk a sudden price drop. Once you get paid, convert to fiat asap.

Tell them to try stepping out of their spoiled western shoes and picture themselves living in the middle east or somewhere really poor.

And when you actually get to use money, you can't spend it wherever you want, the government is oppressive and invades your privacy. Suddenly you have a lot more reasons to like Bitcoin.

I'm getting pissed now. It's now beyond doubt that both BFL and BTCFPGA have been lying from the start and never intended to release ASIC's in 2012. Either that or they are very incompetent and not suited to design and release ASIC's in the first place.
And the worst part? Their schemes worked, I have a preorder over at BTCFPGA, because they seemed to be able to deliver fastest of the three main companies at the time. Avalon was out of the question because they didn't even deliver until January, now it turns out that they are the only ones that don't shit on their customers and run a morally sane business model. If I could choose again I would definitely have chosen Avalon, but that's too late now, I guess it doesn't pay to be honest.

As I linked in the first post, this is what I'm talking about:
"An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks "
Wouldn't you say that's enough to make the currency pretty useless? That's what I meant by "cancels out decentrilazation". The point of decentralization is to prevent any one person or organization from having control over the network, but that is exactly what anyone with control over more than 50% of the network has, and mining pools make it easier for people to gain that control.

I don't. Maybe we technical people think it's not a big problem, but I think the majority of people would lose interest long before the blockchain was completely downloaded. Very few people would let the computer run and download overnight, and they don't even leave the computer on for more than a few hours or minutes at a time (think laptops). So it would not take 12 hours to download, it would take several days or even weeks. That is, if they even remember or bother to start the program every time they use the computer. 0.8.0 might be a step in the right direction, but it's still a LONG, LONG way off.
If you think I'm exaggerating, this is actually exactly what happened to my mother. I got her to buy 10 bitcoins to test it out, this was about two MONTHS ago, and yet she has STILL not completed the blockchain download and actually seen the 10 btc in her wallet.

You can spend it, you just need to be smart about the coin control settings.

My public address got spammed with 0.00001 btc transactions during the previous stress test, but I was able to combine them all into just a few 99kB transactions and send them back to myself as normal spendable inputs. Only lost like 25% in fees. Took a while before the transactions confirmed of course, but they did eventually (after the stress test was over and the mempool had drained).

Effectively yes. They won't let users select the currency they wish to deposit in, and so if it is different from the one you want to pay with, you are forced to swallow paypal's currency exchange fees of about 2.5%. Same for withdrawal, and paying with credit card unless you find the quite hidden option of letting your bank handle conversion. And of course, what is the point of depositing onto paypal if you are not going to pay for something, which also has fees. The seller pays this, but it doesn't matter, a fee is a fee and it will be the customer who has to make up for it in the end for the business to make money. So in many cases, to pay for something results in a double fee. For me the total fee of using paypal like this is 6.49%.

The problem with this view is that if everyone thought this way, there would be no reason for companies to make anything but physical products because they wouldn't be able to make money of it, and we'd lose a lot of stuff we take for granted. Big scale film industry would be gone for sure for example, at best we'd be left with shitty low-budget hobby films.

You're the one posting irrelevant arguments. I'm not talking about fees that are so low that the transaction will never get confirmed, I'm talking about fees lower than what 21.co suggests which will most definitely get confirmed, and quite quickly at that. It is simply misleading to say that the transactions fee "is 18c". It's not.

@_date: 2016-10-27 13:43:29
The fact is that you can choose your own transaction fee. No matter what some website says, the transaction fee for a 226 byte transfer is whatever you choose to pay, not a static 18c.
By "fastest and cheapest" 21.co seem to mean the cheapest with the least possible delay (0 blocks). This is not cheap, this is the absolute premium choice of fee. And they are far from infallible either. You can pay 20 satoshi per byte and it will still be fast enough for most purposes. I regularly send transactions, and I've never spent more than around 60 sat/byte even when 21.co have shown similar estimations as now (it's not the first time). Sometimes the transaction is delayed a couple of blocks, but it's never a problem.
Also, 18c fee does not "rule out sub-$5" transactions. Again, there's no absolute limit, it's up to each what people are willing to pay. As said paypal charges 30c plus a percentage fee, yet people still use it for sub-$5 transactions, so obviously most people wouldn't mind 18c as it's still an improvement on the status quo.
@_date: 2015-09-27 07:27:46
Define "real". In my opinion the fact that majority of society agreeing on this issue enough to make laws about it, makes it real. Anyway, I don't really care about those kinds of philosophical semantics, as said for me the issue is whether or not it is moral, in other words good for society.

I get what you are saying, but I don't think real is the word you are looking for. Ownership and property are concepts, the property of realness don't apply to them like physical or provable objects.
Either way, I think I understand your stance but I think it's an antisocial one. The vast majority of people agree that ownership should be respected, society itself is built on it. To disregard that is incompatible with the way the rest of us sees the world, and you end up living in a way that is convenient for you but inconvenient for everyone else. You say ownership and property are invented by humans for selfish reasons but do you not see that because it is now widely accepted *you* are the one acting selfishly if you defy it?

Do you see the transaction in third party block explorers like  ?
If not, the transaction is probably not broadcast probably. You can fix this by right clicking the transaction and choose "copy raw tx" or whatever it says, and then paste it into a transaction pusher tool, like

@_date: 2015-03-04 14:42:41
That's a complete mess, as a merchant this have happened to me a few times. Basically, the partial payment is stuck in some wallet at bitpay's server. All you get is an e-mail saying that you need to contact support to get the bitcoins back or forward them to the merchant. Same thing happens if the invoice time limit runs out.

Well, for one, over two billion people are unbanked. And a lot of people are banked, but live in countries where it is very hard to send money freely to whoever you want abroad, like China or the middle east, or of course North Korea. And the remittance marked of hundreds of billions of dollars would hugely profit from bitcoin due to less fees and lower transaction times.

Are you sure that's correct? From the counterparty website:


@_date: 2015-10-17 07:26:37
They may not vocally state that they are using bitcoin, which is probably fine. Not every website makes a point of the fact that they are using TCP/IP and HTML, but they still do. Bitcoin moving to the technical background instead of the frontlight is inevitable imo, people (except engineers) don't care about protocols when using computers or the internet, they just care about results and user friendliness.
However what I don't like is companies trying to make separate and especially locked down blockchains. The whole point of blockchain technology is the open, decentralized nature. Otherwise they offer no innovation. And if you are going to use an open, decentralized blockchain, it currently makes no sense to use anything other than bitcoin, because it is the most secure due to the vastly larger mining network. Companies making their own blockchain would need to convince billions of dollars worth of mining equipment to move to their network, or else be inferior to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-26 11:54:21
Subscriptions or donations? Because for subscriptions I have the opposite experience, almost all streamers I have seen already have it enabled, because it's just signing an agreement with twitch that they press the streamers to do. And the one agreement is not just for bitcoin, but for loads of other payments, so if they don't sign it, people in some countries have no way at all to pay.

I've seen "convenience fee" metioned a few times here on reddit. Is that an actual thing? I don't think I've ever seen something like that, if anything there is a fee on the more cumbersome payment methods like snail mail bills because it is more work for the payee to send it out or cash it. How does a fee on a payment method that saves both parties time, make sense?

@_date: 2015-03-06 18:19:32
That is true but from a security standpoint it is easier to go though a processor. Handling bitcoin transactions in your store completely on your own opens you up to hacking risks because I am not as good at security as bitpay/coinbase/whatever's engineers are. However small that risk may be, I want to limit it as much as possible. For what it's worth, even when I used bitpay, I had it directly forward the coins to my personally wallet, I did not convert it to fiat automatically. I have used bitcoin actively since 2011, I consider myself pretty versed it in already.

If you mean impact on the price, I disagree. I think the majority of investors have already anticipated the next halving and bought bitcoin if they feel it is a good idea, and thus we have already seen most of its effect. Because of this I don't think we'll see a dramatic change when approaching or reaching the actual time of the halving.

Very, of course. But many vendors increase the price of hardware to match the bitcoin price. Charge what people are willing to spend, in other words. So the real profit was if you bought the miner just before the bubble started. Then again, you would have made equally much if just bought bitcoin itself with such a timing. And remember, the $1200 price didn't last for more than like a few days.

How many correct shares that's found is completely irrevelant to security. Higher difficulty means that it's harder for a single attacker to gain a higher percentage of the network. 
If the bitcoin network consists mostly of ASICs, this would require the attacker to design their own ASIC from scratch and manufacture and deploy tons of chips, as the difficulty is way too high to compete using multi-purpose hardware. (The current bitcoin network is hundreds of times better at solving double SHA256 *than the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined*). This costs a lot of money and not least a lot of time: there are limited chip fabs in the world and they are quite busy with other customers already. Bitcoin developers would probably be able to detect such an attack before they even succeeded, as the hardware has to be powered up and tested over a period of time before reaching full speed.
However, if the algorithm were "ASIC-proof", the difficulty would be so low that an attacker could relatively easily get 51% of the network instantly simply by using existing hardware such as  supercomputers or clusters. Therefore it is much easier, cheaper and faster to 51% an ASIC-proof cryptocoin.

The bottleneck is not actually the network, but the processing/verifying. The faster your SSD and CPU is, the faster you will be able to sync the blockchain.

If going by dividends you would use at least 4 years to break even, and that is if the dividends stay at their current value, which I very much doubt. ASICminer are profiting from being early with their ASICs, but this summer and fall difficulty will rise dramatically, making it much harder for AM to keep up, even if they add lots more power or sell more machines.

However, long term this might be a good thing. There's no denying that the craze surrounding bubbles have helped raise awareness of bitcoin in a big way. First it was the drug marketplaces, now it's the investing opportunities, in the end bitcoin would not be where it is today if not for this.

I don't get the hype around this. They are cute, but absolutely useless. By the end of this year difficulty will be **at least** 50m, then these units will have a 5 year return of investment time. But after just one year the difficulty will have increased probably another tenfold, which means these units will **never** reach return of investment, even with free electricity. Even as a gift the receiver will only make a miniscule amount of money over the years, definitely not worth you paying $300.

You are contradicting yourself, in your last paragraph you are talking about the long term of things, while in the rest of the post you repeatedly argue that only the state of things right now matters. It doesn't, you must look at least a year into the future when planning a mining investment. Power consumption doesn't matter? It's actually one of the most important factors, that will decide which miners turn a profit and which ones does not, even if they have the same hashing power. Again, you have to look long term when it comes to competition too. It doesn't matter the slightest that AM is the only one able to deliver right now, because your profit depends on the state of mining several years into the future. BFL, Avalon, KNC, Bitfury, and literally dozens of other manufacturers and securities are in competition with AM. And I don't even agree that AM wins in the vendor category right now. What are they selling? USB block erupters? They are useless novelty items.
As for your last paragraph, again, this is because of BFL's incompetence. If they had actually kept their promises on delivery dates, it would have been the other way around, a BFL miner would have been MUCH more profitable than AM stocks. This fall there will be no more walk in the park for AM, many ASIC products will be shipping to the masses from several manufacturers.

Simply because of the sudden, severe rise to 30 USD. We still see this tendency even now, a quick rise is often followed by a large sell-off, and this was a HUGE rise. It didn't gradually build up to $30, it went from $10 to $20 in a week, then skyrocketed to $30 in just one or two days. The early adapters saw their chance to make a huge buck and took it.

@_date: 2013-03-29 22:48:35
I think it's the amount of options that makes it hard.. It really isn't that hard when you get used to it and find a way that works for you. In most cases the hardest thing you have to do is do a single international bank transfer. I personally am in luck because I've found a nice trader in my own country, so I just have to send him a message, and a local bank transfer and there I go, I have bitcoins. 1 minute of work and only takes a few hours to clear.
@_date: 2013-06-30 22:20:20


That's exactly what I said, they are currently leading because they have been early, but that will NOT be the case forever. Their mining technology is way behind most competitors in hash/s/joule, when the difficulty increases for real they will either need extremely cheap power or design completely new chips for the profitability to stay good. Another 1000THps won't do good if 50% of the profits are eaten by the power bill.
Dividends may be increasing short term, I still believe they will fall a bit long term.


Buying your own miner is much more profitable.

Bitcoin Friday was an event Nov. 9th 2012 where lots of bitcoin-accepting stores had sales on their items, in order to promote bitcoin commerce. It was bitcoin's answer to black friday, so to say. It was extremely successful, I think I had more orders that day in my store than the last two months combined, despite having "only" 10% off. The dude behind it said last year that he wanted to do something again, but I haven't heard anything from him since then.

@_date: 2013-01-28 20:55:57
Hah, right. Perhaps they will actually start shipping in february, but I highly doubt they will be able to ship all withstanding orders at least until summer.

There's no company called "ASIC", it's the name of a type of miner.

You can see the price autoupdating every two seconds or so.
However, this is not really that comparable with google support, google support would be much easier and faster for quick lookups, at least I think so.

Not nearly a million, but just a few months ago (after last years bitcoin friday) I had 180 bitcoins in my wallet. I sold most within a few weeks. Fuck.

There are, BIPS, coinbase and paysius to name a few

IMO this would actually be overcomplicating it. It's easier to use a processor such as bitpay. She'd just have to sign up for an account and bitpay would handle everything for her, including automatic exchange rate conversion, transaction preparation and bookkeeping.

Palmer is one of the coolest entrepreneurs out there, like Elon Musk or Bill Gates.

I re-upped the saturation a bit in case someone liked it better that way: 
And lowering the saturation made a cool silver coin looking effect:

Don't bother with large exchanges. Find an individual from your country who buys and sells. To me, buying bitcoins is as easy as doing a domestic bank transfer. Takes 30 seconds and I have the bitcoins within 24 hours.

I don't get how BFL's paypal account isn't frozen yet, with all the claims they have received.

ASIC-resistance is a bad thing, not a good thing. ASICs secure the network more due to hashing faster.

Of course I knew that the blown component was on the motherboard. It's still perfectly possible that the PSU was at fault. Preventing PSU malfunctions from damaging connected components are harder than it sounds. Even regular high end computer components can be fried because of PSU problems, and these guys only had like two weeks to test the boards before shipping, so it's very unlikely that they'd be more protected than that.

It's far more likely and realistic that someone pays with a fake dollar bill than someone reversing a small time bitcoin transaction.

What if you are using a service like bitpay who pays you in local currency? Would you still have to pay 25%?

Refer to my first post, where I said Mtgox is a valid exchange for NON-AMERICANS. We don't even have to agree to disagree, because right now you're saying what I've been saying this whole time. I just think that even though non-americans can't use Mtgox, others can, and it should therefore be a factor for the average price. Because the non-americans are part of the bitcoin market too. Whether the bitcoin average price is stated in USD or an equivalent sum of another currency is irrelevant, it's just two ways to say the same thing.

Surprised that Musk got such a low score. Sure, he didn't deserve to win (yet), but surely he has done much more for humanity than at least Kanye West or Andy Murray. I wrote an essay about him a few months ago, during my research I was surprised to learn how much of philanthropist he really is.

Actually it cant even be compared to bitcoin. Bitcoin is truly international, while dwolla is only available in one country. So I dont understand how you think dwolla is better.
