I think the consensus is to wait for after the fork as the price will dip.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:25:26
I can agree with that. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:27:42
Thanks for this. 
I'm curious as to how or why a group of people could manipulate the tech/currency to the point that they were powerful enough to split the original.
This kind of activity just seems so ... dangerous for a currency that I was under the impression was devoid of manipulation/inflation/tampering of any kind. 
I'm going to continue researching this, but I can't help but feel it's a mistake for the long term health of the whole project. 
Too little people have even begun to understand what a Bitcoin is in the first place, to split it and create two currencies off of the original just seems so short sighted.

I think it's Vert that has a one click miner, I guess you could mine it and then sell it for BTC but I don't know of an exchange that accepts it off the top of my head. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:36:17
I didn't say Bitcoin is inferior to Ethereum, I'm not even saying that it won't be used as a means of an exchange.
I'm saying *failing* that, there is no use for Bitcoin itself, especially not at these prices. 


Agreed, yet again as I stated there is nothing proprietary about this. Anyone can use Bitcoin's tech and implement it for free, and even create a more scarcer coin if that's what the market deems valuable.
Point is, Bitcoin will not survive as a "store of value". It needs utility. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:42:54
I mean that's kind of facetious. I didn't say I fully understood it I'm wondering how this new fork isn't similar to how traditional currency already operates.

I'm not saying your wrong, because you're right. However this line :


Look at the front page of this subreddit. It's all about the price, to the moon, lambos and tesla dreams. Your criticisms of BCH are valid but to allude that Bitcoin is the opposite of people trying to get rich is a bit disingenuous to say the least. 
If we were true to what Bitcoin was it wouldn't even be sold on an exchange, it would be being distributed around to as many people as possible to use as their currency when the time comes, not "hodling" on to it until a big enough price comes to sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:16:55
Good thing the poor can handle $2k swings in a week.
Bitcoin is no longer a viable currency. Between the volatility of a bunch of 20 somethings playing day trader, the Chinese mining centralisation and the ease of insider trading between them and various alt coins, the insane valuation (merited or not), even the very way it's being traded like a stock, the fees currently, and a plethora of other problems currently plaguing Bitcoin from what it originally was.
Whatever Bitcoin is, it's definitely not a currency anymore. It might as well be gold at this point. I think another crypto will solve the currency problem, and perhaps Bitcoin will become the new "gold standard" for cryptos. 
Perhaps a crypto that is minted alongside a bitcoin block, distributed and price locked like standard currency that people can buy dollar for dollar or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:24:17
No it's really not and you should hope that your arrogant attitude towards a currency that needs to be widely adopted isn't shared by many more other then yourself.


Credit cards weren't invented when "were were trading shiny seashells as currency".
Bitcoin has been invented and is what, 8 years in now? 
You're analagy can be boiled down to "People in the stone age weren't clairvoyant and unable to see credit cards as a form of currency coming thousands and thousands of years later" which would literally be no fault of their own.

I read some of the owners comments after posting this looking for an explanation and it makes sense.
He was saying that the price is set to basically ensure that the funds are actually converted within an hour and even then 5% of them fail everyday, and that's 5% of people everyday that get pissed off with shapeshift.
So basically in order to ensure the transaction goes through within a time frame that people don't freak out/it's accepted in the next block they keep it relatively high. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:35:14
It's kind of ironic.
People were speculating that 2X was going to go up to $2K and Bitcoin would see a correction to around $5000-$5500K.
Seems like people wanted to support another coin either way. 
If it's true that BCH is going to see a 400% increase in difficulty with BTC going down 25% simultaneously I don't see how this doesn't revert.
Seems like these chinese miners hold the future of these cryptos in their hands and at the very least this will lead to good discussions about what that future will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:53:31
At least I'm trying to come up with ideas, these are discussions we all should be having if we want the future of Bitcoin to be more then hodl memes.

@_date: 2017-11-04 06:07:41
Going to go ahead and say it up front that I know relatively little about Bitcoin.
That being said, after a couple hours of research this thing is so not ready for the masses yet.
Between learning what a wallet is, how to get one, how Bitcoins are mined, transaction fees, etc its way too much and all so confusing for the general public to understand.
Ultimateltly its this fork thats got me the most confused. You hear about Bitcoin being this decentralized currency and you get used to this idea that Bitcoins are kind of hard to understand but the premise is it's a currency that can't be fucked with.
Then you learn that essentially a bunch of Bitcoin groups got together and decided to do just that, and put the future of Bitcoin into this entirely new thing aka a bunch of powerful people got together and decided how a currency was going to operate for millions of other people. 
It reminds me of the federal reserve and other central banks which is not what I thought Bitcoin was.
Instead of downvotes I'd really appreciate some insight on where I'm wrong on this. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:49:18
Alot of the focus seems to be (other then price) how to spend it, but I think the next step alongside transactions is how it's earned.
The minute we see people actually getting paid in BTC other then their countries respective countries I think this thing blows up.
The problem is I don't see business owners wanted to first buy a different currency to have to pay the bills with it, they would have to be able to earn it first - so mining.
With the limited supply of miners available from Bitmain at retail and the massive price gouge for them on the second hand market this will be a tough solution to solve.
That's why I tend to think one of the largest problems facing BTC right now is Bitmain. They have entirely too much control over the hashrate currently and until another player comes into the market I don't see the growth up Bitcoin (en masse) happening for awhile.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:02:19
Worst case scenario it's a scam. Best case scenario they don't charge a "fee" but sell above market value anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:13:09
I wouldn't go so far as to call it a ponzi scheme but yeah, the original intended purpose is a bit fucked right now.
No one wants to spend a dollar and then next year know it was worth $100 or something. It's a problem that I assume will be solved when some semblance of stability comes into play on the market.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:18:33
So tether concerns are through the roof and all of a sudden they get hacked around the same time, but this is still all FUD to some of you? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:24:55
If Bitmain cant run or build their miners anymore because of a China ban I'm cool with it. The difficulty will adjust and the network can recover.
Im more concerned of what happens when they continue to produce them but stop selling them to the public.
People counter this idea with "well another competitor will come to market" but we know its not that easy and also incredibly expensive.
If Bitmain say continue to produce the s9 for public consumption but develop a miner with triple or quadruple the hash power, mass produce them for themselves while everyone else in the world only has the 13t/hs miners to work with, what happens then?
So far i think theyve only released new miners with double the hash rate of the previous gen but as their tech improves and costs go down I dont see why they wouldnt be able to do this hypothetically.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:21:39


Because no matter what Bitcoin needs utility, just like Gold.
If that utility is becoming the benchmark of "store of value" for other cryptos then so be it, it could very well be enough.
However, Bitcoin has no future without **some** utility in some form or fashion. IMO this "store of value" thing has become so popular because of the very real problems Bitcoin has currently (that I do believe will be solved) and it's easier to hold on to then trying to address all of the current issues that need hammering out - including TX fees, wait times, the difference of price amongst various exchanges, centralization of mining in China etc.
Again, I think all of these things can be adressed and BTC can come out on top, but to say it can survive (especially at these prices and whatever it climbs to next) just because a bunch of people want it to is just not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:41
BCH just broke $2K, if there is going to be a rally on BTC it's now
edit so I don't have the next comment as well.
This has really put these cryptos (in their current state) into perspective for me in correlation to their fiat counterparts, namely regulations.
I believe what we're seeing here is a live example of how insane insider trading can effect a single market. This is way too co-ordinated to be a coincidence.
BTC is down almost point for point to what BCH is up. Quite clear that the major chinese miners that wanted 2X to happen to make some money, found another way to do it instead with this pump/dump.
I think at the end of the day both of these coins will settle and be okay, but there's so many lessons to be learned from this, and so many questions to ask about the future of crypto if it means one segment of a community in one country of the world can control it this much. 
As it stands I can't help but feel the entire "decentralised" part of Bitcoin is in shambles.

Im done trying to have a discussion in this thread. 
I own .0004 bch that was tipped to me a week or so ago when i was trying to figure out how the tipper bot thing worked.
Just because im bringing up some points of concern which i think are valid doesnt mean im a shill. What kind of paraboid thinking us this? Because im not shouting hodl in different variations all of a suddden im FUDing (a term i never knew existed until an hour ago)
Like fuck man, if this is the attitude of this community then i hope people dont come here to talk bitcoin. How fragile do you have to be that you think one persons posts could somehiw effect your holdings?
When did bitcoin become about lambos and teslas and getting mega rich anyway. 
BCH, BTC, LTC, Doge and the rest of thrm deserve to fail if the primary motivator is so a bunch of people can pat each otheri on the back for how early they got in and how rich theyre going to get off the people holding the bag at the end.

Anyone know what pool GUI miner defaulted too back in the day? I remember running it for a couple of hours but have no idea which account it would've went too. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:08:34
The idea of "FUD" itself is propaganda.
Are there people here with an agenda to try and move people from BTC to another coin? Sure.
Are there more people with genuine concerns, doubts, questions and remarks? Absolutely.
I don't think it's FUD to wonder aloud on this forum what exactly has brought the price from 1K to over 8K in a year, that's just someone whose wondering why specifically their investment is acting a certain way. 
Yet people are getting called "FUDsters" for bringing up this question.
People on this forum are too quick to denounce serious questions and concerns about the tech and what is now essentially a stock by people who are either invested or are considering investing.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:08:52
The fact that Bitmain chose to release their latest batches of miners with the **only** option to pay being with BCH tells me something else is definitely coming. 
No way Bitmain isn't hoarding BCH for one round of a pump and dump. They didn't even sell out of s9's and l3+'s until a day or two ago aka they had a bunch more BCH incoming after the last Bcash rally.
They definitely want a BCH run so I can see them making it happen.

Looked like the market was refusing to fill below 6000 and then it dropped to 5950 then 5930 the next second. Will be interesting to see if this if the panic point where the bottom falls out, or if there is some rally to bring it back past 6K
Edit: Just broke 5880 this might be the bottom falling out
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:20:02
I like the idea of a weekly "FUD discussion".
I'd rather there be an open debate and discussion on topics, issues and worries at hand on the current, and future state of Bitcoin there there be this weird almost propaganda like talk on both sides happening lately here. 
There seems to be three sides arguing all over this subreddit currently.
You have the people who are genuinely curious, asking questions and voicing concerns.
You have the people creating and up voting hodl memes in all variations ad nauseum.
And then you have a small group that is just not happy with Bitcoin and would rather people move to their alt of choice.
Right now I feel like that small group, and what seems to be a big portion of this subreddit in the hodl, to the moon memes - which if I'm being honest, i find to be both cringe and borderline propaganda at this point with the lack of decent conversation around here around the actual tech itself and it's future in comparison - are drowning out those who are bringing up valid discussions, thoughts, concerns, and insight to the sub.
It's not ok to start pointing at every criticism and labelling it "FUD". Eventually you're going to miss something important, something that should at least be discussed or at the very least someone should know before investing.
People have to keep in mind that people want to understand Bitcoin still, they come here for information and at times this sub can honestly be viewed as one gigantic pump of the original coin itself which is not cool, and not how I think this community should be viewed by new adopters, and old heads alike.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:21:04


**COOL** still needs utility in the long run


Gold is insurable and mostly stored in bulk by massive companies like Garda, Brinks, etc. Or you know fort knox. So yeah...even stolen gold is tracked by pawn shops so if your grannies necklace shows up the cops will go pick it up for you. 
Bitcoin needs utility. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:37:25
I feel like the collateral damage from accidentally calling someone out for "FUD" who is possibly new and just wanting to voice a concern or get an answer is much worse then just having concerns voiced in the first place.
"FUD" is best counteracted with actual answers, and if you can't find and answer to a certain topic or worry then I think it's worth discussing and having it be out there. That's why I think "FUD" is propaganda in itself.
If something is bullshit that it can be easily called out on without using this term, if it's not bullshit and you use this term then you're probably just actually concerned by what was posted and don't have an answer for it/don't want to find an answer for it so you label the person or topic "FUD", downvote and move on. 
It's a lazy way to deal with something and the meaning of the actual acronym covers pretty much **every** concern someone might legitimately have with Bitcoin that isn't a hodl meme.
That's why I think it's dangerous.

Look, for you to say there has only been one major swing in BTC makes me not be able to take you seriously.
I'm not ignoring the fact that BTC is up 10x, it's part of the reason why I don't think it's a viable currency in it's current state as the person blow me explained.
That and I'm a bit worried about these tethers and how they seem to go hand in hand with this massive increase we've seen this year.
Look, all I'm saying is the Bitcoin we have today is a far cry of what was in the white paper.
If it being traded like a stock, and being attacked and surving over and over again is what it needs to get us to where we need to go then I'm happy. It's still weird to me that the overlying tone of this sub is all about getting rich, lambos and now teslas instead of discussions about how to move it forward or maybe some new technologies we could be creating to help it along it's way but it is what it is. 
I just don't want to be sitting here in what could be the biggest revolution of our lifetime creating and upvoting "hodl" memes ad nauseum when we could be missing a chance on improving or preventing it from becoming something terrible. 
That's all. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:23:42


I really wish people would stop thinking this is a valid long term viability for BTC.
BTC's "store of value" state right now is only working because of the simple premise that one day it will be a functional currency used by many.
The minute that belief goes away BTC is useless, just numbers on a screen and the more and more people who no longer believe in it's future utility the less and less it will be worth. 
BTC **needs** an implementation and a use. A utility of some kind. Even gold has a utility and value in the mere fact that it can be melted down, used to make jewellery, utlized to make parts for phones etc. The scarcity of gold means something to the people who hold it and the people who wish to buy it to make use of it.
If BTC no longer has a use of a means of exchange the scarcity of the coin means nothing because nothing can be done with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:00:35


Thank you for that.
Just a newbie here but it's scary how many people are already using the dictated vernacular that only benefits the people who want this thing to take a dive.
I don't think many people understand the weight of even calling Bitcoin 1x in the first place.
Not only does it legitmize the fork, but to the general public, and to people who aren't researching this all the time, if you start to call Bitcoin 1x when there is a 2x alternative, they will start to think that 2x is the upgraded version of what once was Bitcoin. 
I understand that's what they want you to believe but It's not a good thing for those who believe in the Bitcoin project from my limited understanding of the whole thing.
