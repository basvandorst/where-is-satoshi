And if your local machine breaks? Or will you also have an old school ledger to match your ledger nano?

Not quite sure you understand the purpose of a centralized banking system and the benefits it provides.

Have you heard of a bank panic. The only purpose of a centralized system is to prevent a bank panic. 
Imagine the entire world had all their money in btc. What would have happened to the global economy when BTC went from 19k to 6k?

Take a basic macro class. I’m an economist and CFA. 
Ok. The “no volatility” is an interesting opinion but that’s all it is, an opinion. 
So let’s say one month the good costs 1BTC to create or import. Then the next month the good costs 3BTC. Are you presuming that instantly what people have in their wallets will inflate to adjust for this difference?
I believe that the future will be a combination of the current system and crypto. Crypto will serve to be a medium of transfer of funds. 
The only way to prevent such volatility is if it is semi centralized to prevent such huge market manipulation. 
Trust me man, I’m in crypto as well as FIAT. Decentralization is what caused the Great Depression. A mass of bank panics that had a snowball effect. The Fed was not permitted to get involved and it caused a global crisis. 
In all honesty, BTC can be a global currency but we need to have centralization from country to country to prevent this exact form of crisis

This is done to prevent criminal laundering and to allow accountability of where your money comes from. Unless you are a vendor on dark web or a criminal this is the way it goes if you want to use/get real money out.

You don’t find it convenient being able to categorize your payments so that they are easier to identify?

That’s ok. Just letting you know why it’s in there. 
Generally as an exchange the company facilitating this would also be liable for any potential laundering done through their service. It’s most a matter of them keeping business as business.
