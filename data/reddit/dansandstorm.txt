Segwit2x fork block needs to be larger than 1MB so spv client could download fork block and compare the size of it

Nope, only 2 miners and NYA only obligate to support signal at bit 4 and fork so if those 2 miners switch to 2x chain in November they won't break agreement

So being centralised wallet is now a feature on r/bitcoin . What a hypocrisy

I don't think that big blockers gone their way. Only 2 companies from NYA support BCC: ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com and they still mine mostly segwit2x chain.
My prediction is that Core will be the ones that fork off if segwit2x could achive 90% hashrate in November. Especially considering there is already proposal changing POW from luke-jr

If a single guy (following r/bitcoin narrative) can spam the bitcoin network and make it unusable that means the bitcoin as a cryptocurrency already failed. Think how easy it would be for a big company like microsoft to create plenty of spam transactions that result increasing fees,mempool backlog. It will always be a case if you artificially limit capacity of something.

I agree that's why we need to get rid off Blockstream

This makes me to support segwit2x even more

Stop spreading FUD he's talking about segwit tx discount which allow more complex txs to be cheaper which is unfair for people using less complex txs
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:23:29


Core already admitted it:


That's why we need to get rid off core as default client
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:15:39


What??? If you are refering to [this tweet]( then he's right. The discount ratio of 1:4 for segwit txs compared to non segwit transaction IS unfairly high and doesn't correlate to used resources.

You can thank core devs that changed mempool expiry from 72h to 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:37:28
No it won't. Segwit2x is currently only proposal with majority miners, business support and it will lock in segwit before August. Get over it.

Blockstram currently have 0 profit from bitcoin while Bitmain is selling bitcoin ASIC and It's in their business to maintain bitcoin lead in cryptocurrency market share. Blockstream's only product are side chains that require segwit to work, so I trust more Bitmain than Blockstream

if that isn't open source then i don't know what it is

1, lukejr coin will be orphaned once people realize that it will took more than 1 hour to mine block with current difficulty at &lt;10% hashrate
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:05:56
And who is funding core devs? Oh I forgot core devs works non-profit and have nothing do with Blockstream/AXA and of course core's github repo is fully decentralized and it's not like there are few people with merge rights that are working for the same company.....
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:08:23
Segwit2x is bip148 compatible if it's activated before  1 August(which is very likely considering 80% hashrate and f2pool and other Chinese pools recently joining in) it will work like bip148 by orphaning non segwit blocks and effectively reaching core's 95% threshold.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:59:47
So better let's give all the power to US company that pays core devs. Core can end scaling debate instantly by following the NYA and merging segwit2x to core. The worst part is that core is failing at communicating with community and instead of seeking consensus they split community even more.

Only if Blockstream didn't block all the block size increase proposals.
