How would you do it? At some point, in order to be responsive you need the data to be physically close together; if you want sub-10ms latency you need to be within 1,300 miles of the datacenter and that's assuming no latency other than the speed of light in fiber. And even if you manage to solve that, the other nodes storing your data might be doing their own thing, or they might be completely offline, or... there's all kinds of things that can go wrong in hilarious ways when you decentralize all your storage.

@_date: 2014-01-13 06:54:15
It's a different kind of problem. The speed-of-light bound on latency is one that cannot be improved on short of revolutionary new physics, and the fact that computers can go offline isn't going to change. Plus, how are you going to do computation on all your data? The only reason Google can do what they do is that they have a lot of terrifyingly fast hardware that's very close together. How do you solve problems that need high-speed low-latency computation in a decentralized system?

The problem is that a decent GPU mining at 100% a day will get you on the order of 50 cents a day.

The problem is that this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of state machines and Markov chains. What do you mean by 'state 0' is a transitive state'? If you mean that it'll be exited with probability 1 on the next transition, then that's true of basically every state except for state 0, the only one that can transition to itself. The fact that 0' transitions to 0 with probability 1 doesn't make the transition 'immediate' any more than the transition from 3 to 4 or 2 is 'immediate'. eYour entire analysis rests on this incorrect assumption, so your counter-analysis of this paper is incorrect.
It's true that their analysis breaks down when α=1/2 because then it yields that all the p_k are 0, but that only means that it's potentially invalid in the limit case, not that their entire rest of their analysis is wrong; in particular, it makes sense to me that the attacker gets 100% of revenue when α=1/2 because the revenue approaches 1 as α approaches 1/2.

Suppose I want to double-spend against someone who waits for 6 confirmations. I send the BTC to them and then start hashing in secret against a block that *doesn't* have the transaction, while the rest of the network hashes against a block that does. I then 'race' against the main network; I want to get more confirmations on my no-transaction block than the rest of the network has on the block with the transaction. But I also have to wait until the rest of the network has at least 6 transactions, or the person I sent BTC to won't actually do whatever it was that I wanted.
Once the main chain has reached 6 confirms, and the merchant's done whatever, I release my chain if it has 7 or more confirms, since then the network will switch to my chain. If not, I keep trying; if I control more than 51%, I will always eventually pass the main chain, if not it's not guaranteed but it's still possible.


The point is that you assume that the service always waits for exactly 6 confirmations (or however many), then does the irreversible action.

So your process relies on every citizen having a unique identifier assigned at birth with no other identifying information? You'd need a central authority to assign this, at which point the 'decentralization' of the system becomes questionable. You also need some way to select authorized authenticators. I feel like blind signatures might help you here but I suspect they also make revocation much more difficult.
Plus, it's open to an attack where the authenticators take a picture of the person that requested their signature and try to find out who they are from that. You could solve this by having the signature be a blind one, but that also means that if it's later discovered that someone fraudulently got their key signed you'd be completely out of luck unless you could determine *which* key it is. Basically, you need some way of mapping person to signature to allow revocations, and a simple 'sign your vote with a key' scheme will trivially let whoever owns at mapping see who voted how.
Anyway, this is all academic obviously; anybody that thinks that a good cryptosystem will come out of a reddit discussion needs to read up more. Designing cryptosystems is *hard*.

When you generate an address, you generate two things: the public key and the private key. Going from the private key to the public key is easy; going from the public key to the private key is *hard*; so hard it might as well be impossible. So you can't decide to just say 'ok, I want this person's address', because you'd only have the public key.
It's technically possible for two people to generate the same private key, in which case they could spend each others' bitcoins, but it's so unlikely it's not worth worrying about.
You can generate vanity addresses; for example, all the Satoshi Dice addresses start with '1dice'. You just can't do it faster than 'generate an address and hope it looks like the thing you want', I don't think.

 &gt; However 0' -&gt; 0 takes almost no time and at a much smaller timescale because it's just about the block propagation step, so the time it takes for 0' -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 is the same as 0 -&gt; 1.
No it's not. 0' is the end state after a fork has happened, with some miners mining on the attacker's branch and some on the honest branch. This only transitions to 0 when one of the branches gets another block on it, which happens once every 10 minutes or so, same as any other transition. In section 4.2, this transition from 1 to 0' corresponds to item (f), and the transition from 0' to 0 corresponds to items (b), (c), and (d); both of these only happen when a block is found.

You'd have to modify the protocol, since as it is there's no way to prove you mined without solving a block, which is out of reach of most people.
Then you'd massively hurt adoption since for most people mining makes them pennies a day at most and might even cause their graphics card to fail faster. So Bitcoin would become a currency that costs you money to use.

No, it shows *a* transaction happened. OP could prove they owned the sending address (if they have the key) but they can't prove that the receiving address was owned by the buyer unless they have some kind of signed attestation.
@_date: 2013-06-03 03:52:17
My understanding is that a k-of-n multi-signature transaction is implemented by sending the money to an address that has n keys, k of which must be used to send any money out of it. In a 2-of-3 scenario where Alice wants to buy a widget from Bob with trusted arbitrator Trent, Alice sends the payment to a 2-of-3 multisignature address where all 3 of them have the key. Then, Bob constructs a transaction giving him the money and signs it; once Alice has received the widget, she signs it as well.
If Bob never sends the widget, Alice constructs a transaction that gives her the money and gets Trent to sign it after proving that she didn't get the widget.
Note that Trent can't give the money to somebody other than Alice or Bob, since they presumably won't sign transactions that go to somebody else.

So suppose I'm in a grocery store and buy 1BTC worth of groceries. At this point, there is nothing the store can do to hurt me; at worst, I've made a fair grocery exchange.  After the cashier sees my transaction and I leave, I then send another transaction to myself in a double-spend attempt. According to this proposal, the store then creates a transaction that spends my original output and sends it all to tx fees; the net result is that all of the 1BTC goes to tx fees. So I haven't come out any worse for the double-spend attempt, and the store is out 1BTC. I don't see how that helps.

According to [this paper]( which looks like it's pretty good, an attacker with 25% of the mining capacity can reverse a transaction with *6%* probability (see table 1, q=24%, n=6).

So a quantum computer can't try 'every solution at once'; this is a common incorrect perception of quantum computing. What it *can* do is execute an exhaustive search over a n bit space in 2^(n/2) time, which is faster than a classical computer can do (normally exhaustive search takes 2^n time). The algorithm to do so is known as Grover's algorithm; the naive version only works if there's exactly one 'answer', but a modified version that still gives exponential speedup for an unknown number of answers also exists.
What does this mean for bitcoin mining? It means that *if* you can implement the hash algorithm as a quantum operation (which is a massive, massive 'if'), you can probably construct a quantum computer that will outpace any classical miner. The difficulty will then massively spike, and classical mining will become pointless.
But you also run into another issue: quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography. Now, an address is a hashed version of a public key, so you can't steal from *any* address. But if you send from an address, you reveal the key, and at that point the quantum computer can get your private key. So in a post-quantum world address reuse becomes insecure.

(283) 137-1023
Obviously neither of them is more insecure, but I guarantee you that the first one's going to be easier to remember. Similarly, if I ask you to remember the word "quantification", that's easier than if I look it up in a dictionary, find that it's the 21732nd word, and ask you to remember '21732'. (Assume for the sake of this that I picked that word by picking a word uniformly at random from the dictionary.)
To pick a silly example, we can also trivially maintain entropy while making it *harder* to remember by using words in a language other than the user's native one.

This is a pretty misleading statement, though. For example, it's pretty easy to make an *incredibly* insecure encryption scheme out of RSA. (for example, E(2x)=E(x)^2, so you get lots of malleability). It's not about the blocks, it's how they're put together.

It's worth noting that just because the AES-256 primitive is strong *does not mean that anything built on top of it is*.

What? FRB is when a bank loans out a certain fraction of the money that they keep in reserve; if you deposit $1000 in a bank, the bank is allowed to then loan out, say, $500 of that on the assumption that you won't ask for all $1000 of it back at once (or if you do, that they can cover it via other reserves, etc.). The only aspect of this that'd be impossible with bitcoins is that under the current system the FDIC can step in and ask for more money to be printed to cover deposits if a bank becomes totally insolvent; this is obviously impossible with bitcoin.
Also, printing more money doesn't 'steal' from someone's existing money any more than reprinting trading cards 'steals' from the people who had rare cards that are now no longer common.

Re: latency: you misunderstand me. How do you see the connection on a cross-country request going? At some point, you *need* to have a long, relatively static backbone (i.e., centralization), unless your plan is to literally saturate the country with nodes. Plus, I don't really think you can get the same backbone bandwidth from wireless that you can from wired connections. And running wire is *expensive*. The nature of the problem lends itself to centralization.


And whoever runs those drones is going to become another centralization point.
You're basically trying to build a networking system that requires ubiquitous high bandwidth high reliability low latency wireless networking in a world where the average consumer's wireless connection is none of those. Maybe in 30-50 years?

You can't identify yourself with a bitcoin address any more than you can identify yourself with a PGP key, though. PGP gets around this by using a web of trust model, but there's no mapping of bitcoin to real life identity like there is with PGP keys. You can prove that you own the key by signing a message with it, but you can't prove that you're actually Alex Smith without having some kind of ID proving it. 


I'm not sure why you say this. With a credit card, I can buy something and then do a chargeback if it fails to deliver. With bitcoins, I'm out of luck. Similarly, if my bank account gets broken into and drained, I can get my money back. If my bitcoin wallet gets drained, it's impossible to get my money back.

No, that's completely wrong. That's not how difficulty of one-way function inversion works. If you SHA-256 twice you've only doubled the amount of time it takes to break; you haven't multiplied it by 2^256 (or 2^128 with Grover's algorithm).

No, that's the current M1 of bitcoin. The 51% attack value is more like 2 billion dollars, and that's only if you make some questionable assumptions.
Also, IIRC the difficulty can only increase by a constant factor each adjustment.

No, but code that massively reduced the strength of a key generation algorithm might [make it into a very popular package manager and then remain undetected for over a year](

In a 51% attack, any progress that the honest part of the network makes will be overtaken by the dishonest part with probability 1 given enough time. So the other miners could occasionally get ahead, but then eventually the attacker will publish an even longer blockchain and everybody will switch to it, negating the other miners' progress.

A quantum computer can invert an n-bit hash function using Grover's algorithm in time proportional to 2^(n/2), whereas for a classical computer it takes time proportional to 2^n. So a quantum computer can mine coins way faster than a classical one, but this may simply then lead to a massive difficulty adjustment (making non-quantum computers useless) followed by a return to the normal block mining speed.

You can 'create' money if you add debts and credits, yes. This doesn't have anything to do with 'counterfeiting' money, it's just an accounting trick. You can do the exact same thing with bitcoins. The only difference is that under the USD system, if Mike, Peter, Steve, and Tom all withdraw their money at the same time and the bank doesn't have enough reserves then the FDIC steps in. Under the BTC system, someone's not going to get paid.


Suppose Alice lends $500 to Bob, who then loans that same $500 to Carol. Over the next two years, Bob pays back the loan plus 10 percent interest, and Carol does the same. Would you say that $100 in interest has been made on money that 'never existed'?

Yeah, it was pretty awful of them to force him to run a drug-selling site.

So poisoning someone isn't violence?

How are bet IDs generated? What's to stop you from manipulating the bet by occasionally changing winning bet IDs to losing ones?

I think I just got galtse'd.

You can't generate a transfer using an address unless you have the private key or can break EC~~B~~DSA, both of which are unlikely.

One of the concerns is that the attacker might not care about the stolen BTC itself, but might want to kill it off or hurt it as a whole. (You can buy enough ASICs to straight up own 51% with a million dollars or so; in order to stop *that* you'd need to modify the protocol.)

You don't know what you're talking about.

You can pull the same argument for ANY ethical principle. Show me where I agreed that I don't own the entire universe. You can't? Oh, well I'll just be taking my things back from you then.

Property's just an idea, but I bet you'd be pretty upset if I started taking your stuff.

Giving things that can easily kill people to people who don't have training seems like an awful idea.

So wait, someone like me who's mining on their normal desktop GPU is contributing to volatility?

Just like how all dollars exist, they just haven't been extracted from the cotton plants yet?

I don't like Mega because Kim is a shitty person that people are treating like the second coming of Jesus because the government fucked him.
