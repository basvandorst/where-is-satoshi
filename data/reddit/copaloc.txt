Bitcoin doesn't have to replace fiat for that meme to come through. If there is a large enough sell side, people will pay. 
More and more vendors are integrating bitcoin or crypto payments as we speak. Even if there is a large global economy where people can buy digital goods freely, that's a crazy market. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:37:17
If nothing, it will prevent massive misallocation of capital. Capital today gets allocated based on who you are and who you know, rather than how well you can utilize that capital for social good. Easy money leads to bubbles. The global economy today is a bubble on top of a bubble on top of an entire pyramid of bubbles. 
Many industries - particularly banking, finance, and insurance are not prepared for the onslaught that is coming. There will be new billionaires. However, they will be more in numbers, and a much larger percentage of them will have proven by their actions that they believe in decentralizing trust and power. 
The worst problem that the world faces today is that it is built on top of too many large institutes that have all become too big to fail - a consequence of compounding bad investments across multiple sectors. Something which only easy money can sustain for this long.
As someone said - Bitcoin isn't a bubble, it's the pin. 
Of course there will be more billionaires. Anyone who owns more than 10 bitcoin is a Satoshi billionaire. But there won't be just a handful of billionaires like we have today :) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:55:02


No. It doesnt have to go up infinitely for that to happen. Even if people use bitcoin for 5% of their transactions, that is massive. At a global scale, it makes each bitcoin worth millions. More people are using bitcoin for everyday transactions today than they did last year. This will only grow, not slow down. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:08:41
You realize there is more friction in selling bitcoin in an exchange for fiat, than just spending it using a bitcoin visa card or so? Tons of people are doing that now. I know substantially more people today who spend a significant chunk of their expenditures in btc. Most got into it recently as well. 
If you had put in $400, which is suddenly $4K - you might just let it sit there. At 40k, you don't sell it all for fiat.
It's going up this fast because it is disruptive technology. Do you realize what a new form of money is? The future will have an ecosystem of digital currencies, and bitcoin is the first. It's digital gold. As long as cryptocurrencies remain, someone will accept bitcoin. In 100 years, it might become a rare artefact. 
Yes, price might collapse tomorrow - but remember that at each dip, those who missed out will buy back 2x. All those people who got burnt by Ver, got burnt by Dimon, by all the FUD over the years around China ban etc - they will all jump right in. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:16
You ignore the streisand effect. So far, gov focus on cryptos has increased demand for cryptos, particularly bitcoin and other established ones. 
Secondly, you overestimate the governments ability to get shit done. They could have used the secret processor to kill bittorrent or tor - they are still struggling with decrypting whatsapp messages. 
You forget that governments are full of departments where 99% of the people do nothing, and out of the remaining 1%, many might already have stake in crypto.

I understand that. 
However, it is not just sovereign debt. Nation states are fucked with high corporate debt, AND high domestic debt. That points towards a failure of the centrally planned banking system and monetary policy. 
Debt works in the same, regardless. Just because it is Sovereign debt, doesn't mean that no one will have to pay it. People who have exposure to fiat or fiat backed stores of values like publicly traded equities, will have to pay the debt back in the forms of inflation in the future. This is why millenials are buying bitcoin, because they see that saving in fiat gets them nothing. Fiat is a shit currency - get out of it, while you can.

There is a massive difference. 
The note ban meant that people can't exchange old notes in banks after a certain date. Guess what? The government owns the fiat, as well as most of the banks in India. 
The indian government has no control over bitcoin. It has no say in what gets added to the code, who runs the node, who mines them, who accepts them, who runs the exchanges etc. 
The worst thing this government can do is ban exchanges. You think Indians will not want to import bitcoin? Check INR historic exchange rate against the USD. The Indian government has EVERY INCENTIVE IN THE WORLD, to devalue the rupee against the dollar? Why? So that it can export more services overseas, and tax the fuck out of everything. 
Did you see the budget? Did you notice that the government increased duty on import of phones and gadgets? Do you think it is to promote the non existent local chip manufacturing industry? No, it is to squeeze more money out of the middle class. What do you reckon all these cash based small businesses in India will do? They are all connected to the Internet? There are so many freelancers in India. Their parents bought gold. Guess where they are going? 
Good luck stopping this storm. 
No, the Indian government can ban crypto. On the contrary, RBI will be one of the first crypto casualties.

You are talking about India - one of the most corrupt places in the world, where the population has a fetish for gold (to save their money). People don't trust the government with their wealth, and there is a history of trying to move money out of the system. This is why they tried to ban cash. 
As I said - good luck trying to ban cryptos, when you can buy bitcoin from an offshore exchange, go on a euro trip, and then buy gold with it somewhere with relaxed ID requirements. 
In a global economy, it is impossible to ban a global currency. If they could, they would have. They will continue to attack it - but if bitcoin can't take it, it's not really a BFT, anti-fragile system. 
If you believe bitcoin can be controlled by the government, you shouldn't be holding or investing in it.

5K would really be difficult - simply because the rise to 8k was on the back of surviving contentions forks.

I am not sure if you are from India - but it is a huge country and laws are not easily enforceable. On top of that, pushing people towards paytm style apps implies small traders and retail shop owners will have to use paytm.
They don't like to - they have to pay GST. Same with buyers - why pay GST, when you can pay in cash...errrm crypto. 
My friends in India get groceries delivered to their home using whatsapp from the local supermarket / grocery-store / mom-pop store - whatever you want to call these. India has millions of such small shops selling all sorts of things, and there is a massive black market. Where do you think all that money will go with cash being banned? 
The indian government has a massive incentive in banning crypto, but as I said - good luck. They can't. This is not how this works. There are global exchanges. There are locals who will always exchange in fiat for you. 
If anything, you should setup some business to sell bitcoin to Indians - you will become a millionaire. Of course, tehre are regulatory hassles around getting money out of India, but when has that stopped the enterprising individual?

I don't claim to be an expert, but I have been into crypto and tech long enough to understand parts of the underlying tech. It helps to have a background in maths and computers as well. 
What makes cryptos valuable is exactly what prevents it from being scalable. If you don't get this, you are missing the whole point about crypto.

Of course you can build other things using blockchain. You can even solve problems that don't really exist or have other solutions.
The dlt/blockchain tech enables the bitcoin network to be trustless, which makes bitcoin an extremely valuable currency. There is no counterparty risk. 
Tokens are a store of value - it doesn't matter how they are created, by mining blocks or otherwise. One could sell their email password in exchange for money. However, if there is something of value that a lot of people accept in exchange for a variety of other things of value - this thing becomes a currency. 
Bitcoin is by far the largest cryptocurrency - that's what makes it fascinating. Not the blockchain - it is, as you have put it yourself, relatively simple tech. It's the coming together of different things, which makes bitcoin special. This includes the social aspects of it - the hodler culture around it etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:29:37
You are being downvoted because these questions are usually asked by shills here, and have been answered to death. 
Fees being high and transactions being slow are not as much of a reality as many would like you to believe. You can regularly see transactions going through which are tens of thousands of dollars or more, with a few cents in piece and confirming within 10-15 minutes. Good luck trying to do that with traditional banking
Many exchanges would even hold bitcoin for you today, and give you a visa card, using which you can do instant low fee transactions anywhere in the world. 
However, the point is that making transactions convenient or easy to use or cheap or quick are not the only features a currency needs to have. Fiat has a massive disadvantage in being fundamentally inflationary / having no cap.

Those things are not needed for 99% of people, who are neither terrorists nor pedos. The &lt;0.1% of criminals still game the system, the reason credit card purchases take 3 months to confirm, if you want to eliminate charge back. 
What about innovation in monetary policy? That's more fundamental than payments. Value of fiat is asymptotically approaching garbage. You could have a top job in most major cities, and still will never be able to buy land in that city. What is that? That's the impact of fiat undergoing hyper-inflation right now. There is too much easy money because of the way fractional reserve banking works, why all nation states are today insolvent, while the general population can't afford jack shit. 
Regulatory capture has bought the system to its knees, and bitcoin is the technical disruption we needed as a civilization. Hodl and move on. 
EDIT: Also, bitcoin devs will never work in a bank. Do you know why? Because banks are run by suits who don't understand code, or maths or science or anything that is fucking real. What BFT are they going to explain to such ignorant boomer morons? Discuss fucking TV shows?

Lol it is. The ultra wealthy find it easy to move money around using traditional banking. There have been several money laundering accusations against banks like hsbc. 
I was referring to general credit card fraud though. Credit cards are fundamentally insecure, which is why payments take 3 months to settle


Even apartments in high-rises are expensive. Secondly, land in cities have always been constrained, but people having wages less than median could afford to buy a house. People in wages in top 10% can't anymore.
Why have more infrastructure not been created, to accommodate the growth in population and support the growth in the economy?
Let me explain how this works:
Central banks create easy money. People with status (suits who manage funds in banks and major investment firms) get access to this first, and mis-allocate it. This creates bubbles in an economy : in the form of oversupply of shitty apartments, unprofitable businesses, while prices of commodities that are needed keep going up (good healthcare, quality organic food, fresh air, water..). Prices rise because by the time this trickles down to the working class in the form of salary, it has already lost value - because more money has been printed. 
It has everything to do with the banks. Banks perform various functions for Central banks, and these are all part of pretty much one giant regulated organization. JPM, Citi or Goldman possibly agree on 99% of things. There is no competition there.

Lol. Your best argument is a personal attack? 
Bank engineers are shit compared to engineers who work for Google, Amazon, Facebook etc. 
The best and most respected engineers have always worked on open source protocols like Linux, Bitcoin etc - because they do it out of passion. This is not bullshit, this is a fact. 
There is no bank, which can afford to hire and keep bitcoin core developers. It's a fundamental ethos mismatch. Banks treat executives as ruling class, developers as working class - it's a class system out there, where respectable engineers will only choose to work out of financial obligations and compulsions, will never put in their best - and are all just waiting to get out and work on their favorite projects. 
The ones who are not, are the shitty engineers who don't want to believe that they are in this profession for money and not because they love computer science - which is why, they are shit to begin with.

Yes, in an ideal world where everyone is trustworthy and rational. Where there is no Byzantine General problem at all. 
In the real world, average consumers need a payment layer - this includes features like refunds, escrows, instant transfers, claw backs etc etc. 
Sure, you can add all these to your base layer, but then you don't have a decentralized system. You have bloatware running on a few nodes. 
Guess who already has all these features? Banks in their payment apps!

This. If you think western media has no clue, wait till you meet the indian counterparts. The average Indian journalist has a sub 50 IQ (or whatever is the lowest, where you are able to type or copy-paste articles)
India cannot ban bitcoin, even if they wanted to. It's the most inefficient government in the world (I grew up there)
Their equivalent of a ban would be a DNS block on bitcoin.com 
I feel bad for Indians though - it's a country that favors capital control. The new government is just as left wing retard as the old ones. Indian and South Asian crypto enthusiats in the long run will have no option but to either emigrate or pay premiums to buy at a higher value. 
Also, the Indian govenrment will absolutely go for futile and unreasonable controls on Cryptos. Their banks are broke as fuck. The chancellor equivalent in India has been bailing out banks and bloated corporations every month, for the last 3 decades. 
However, if you think governments will not try to do that, or if you think it's all about the blockchain - you don't know dafuq you are investing in.

The netherlands is also one of the few remaining functioning countries.

And yet ship nothing beyond shitty UI changes. 
Most are demotivated, work on mundane projects, bull-shitters or not top tier engineers. Please don't compare circus lions with ones in the wild.

You say that based on stats published by the government. Do you understand how inflation is calculated? 
They choose a basket and associated weights to calculate the eventual average inflation. These weights are largely a result of different regression methods. The UI uses hedonic regression for e.g.  These metrics are heavily game-able and have massive logical fallacies. 
Good example? I could say the price of bread has gone down or stayed flat over the years (which is what inflation stats will tell you). However, people are increasingly eating shittier bread with poor nutritional value, because they are cheaper to manufacture. If you want to eat good healthy bread, it 10-20x more expensive than shitty white bread. However, inflation stats completely overlook these things. 
You would say we are living in times of hyper-inflation, if you compare quality of life vs %ile income earned. Someone in top 10%ile in NYC today, has a much worse standard of living compared to someone 10 years back. Yes, they have snapchat - but one every other parameter (food, healthcare, rents, electricity, banking and financial services etc) - they are paying more for shittier service


That's what they want you to believe. Zoning laws etc, are set by local governments very often - to keep a place desirable to live in. You completely ignore that other thriving cities like Detroit literally DIED. Housing is cheap there. The real issue is that the economy is on fire, which is why everyone from all over the world only have a few cities to move into. 
They keep blaming zoning laws, nimbys, immigrants - playing one party against another, when the underlying issue is that the financial system has collapsed. There is hyper-inflation if you don't look at the bullshit garbage maths behind CPI - and look at the reality. 
What does it cost today, to own a house in a decent city which has employment? What does it cost today, to have a secure retirement fund? What does it cost today to fund public services with tax? What does it cost today to eat clean produce? Or have access to good insurance?

You can drive to work in India, while smoking a joint - with full traffic all around you. Rest of the world won't get it, until they are there. 
It absolutely does not matter what the Indian government says. If anything - this is a buy signal. This will drive price of bitcoin higher in India. 
Indian people work very hard, but are fucked over by a post colonial government. Their tax systems etc are all from a colonial era (guess how fairly colonies were taxed?). Post independent, the corrupt governments went hyper socialist - if you work hard and make money, you will be unreasonably taxed there. 
It's one of the most corrupt places in the world, where the population have a cultural affinity towards gold like assets (to save their money). People don't trust the government with their wealth, and there is a history of trying to move money out of the system. This is why they tried to ban cash. 
This FUD is an absolute joke, just like all other ones around. 
Eth flippening is the worst. Eth has so much supply that all this pump and dump money moving into it past few weeks, has barely moved the needle on the price

It can go down to 5k or below. At which point, I will buy.
