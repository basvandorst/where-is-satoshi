@_date: 2015-06-01 18:46:00
I really don't see why this has to be a controversial change. The 1mb limit was arbitrary, a 20mb limit would be just as arbitrary but demonstrably more suited for the current situation as blocks start bumping into the (default) upper size limits and leaving transactions unconfirmed as a result. What should be done to actually fix this problem (20mb limit is a band-aid) is something we don't know and don't *need* to know just yet, if the 1mb-&gt;20mb hard fork works out, a 20mb-&gt;bitcoin 0.20 fork will work as well.

If bitcoin is ahead of its time, then the phenomenon will die down and simmer for a few years, even a decade. But, the essence of it being a P2P virtual currency will live on as long as the Bitcoin protocol doesn't collapse completely, and when/if interest grows again, Bitcoin the protocol and bitcoin the currency will be the first and foremost again by virtue of being the most widespread.

I think the difference that this whole anti-Bitcoin stance made in sales was negligible, but that doesn't really matter. What I think matters is that Apple showed again that they dictate what may and what may not be installed on their phones, and showed it to a group of people that probably included a lot of their own developers and developers of IOS apps. If that ends up driving a few developers to adopt Android as their main platform instead of IOS, that hurts them more than a few sales.

I see your point, but it's weakened by the fact that we deal with these exchanges anyway even when we withdraw our funds from them immediately. That is like dealing with those Nigerian scammers with very strict rules that you think will minimize the impact of anything bad happening. If you buy BTC by sending your dollars and the exchange suddenly crashes or takes off with the funds right in the middle of it, your money is gone just as well as if you had sent them to Nigerian princes. That is unless you claim to get all your BTC without ever relying on any third party at all, in which case I think you'd be part of a small minority.

(on the subject of) Missing bitcoin cash: "I'm not missing," says Moolah CEO
It makes sense like that, newspaper headlines were never meant to be complete sentences. Plus, what is bitcoin if not the cash of the internet? Isn't that exactly what bitcoin is supposed to be? Yeah, it's not physical, but I can give it to you without anyone else involved, you get it immediately and I can't get it back unless you give it to me. Isn't that what's most important about the traditional, physical, fiat cash?
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:08:38
As far as I know, his reasoning for not having it added already is that it would take too long to rescan the whole chain, because the private keys don't come with a timestamp. I don't get why it wouldn't be enough to just add a datepicker to indicate how old the key is and be done with it. Yeah it will probably take a while to catch up anyway, but at least it will *work*.

All routes over the known exchanges will take a few days (probably) just because they need to have your identity on record. If you haven't registered at any of them, it will take a while. The fastest route to get it NOW would be something like localbitcoins.com, find someone near you who does in-person with cash and meet up. It's risky and expensive, but that is what you get if you need it right now.

Translated: you can't use IAP to buy "any currency". With my BTC-tinted glasses on, this sounds like an obvious way to say that you can't make an app that uses IAP to buy BTC, but buying BTC by sending a buy order to an exchange would be a-ok. It could easily refer to in-game currencies though, such as ISK from EVE or Linden dollars.
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:52:21

you'd think it's enough to explain to people that you don't NEED to trust exchanges for any longer than it takes for your fiat to be exchanged into BTC or vice-versa, but as long as they keep on offering the opportunity to store BTC, people will keep stashing their BTC on an exchange.

Of course! Isn't that the whole idea of bitcoin? If you couldn't send the bitcoin from where-ever you bought it to where you want to store or spend it, it wouldn't be much of a currency, would it?
I recommend that you read up on what bitcoin is and what you can do with it before you buy large amounts. 40 USD won't break the bank, but it sure would be shitty if you lost it just because you didn't know what you were doing.

It's basically a standard wire transfer, but the merchant gets instant confirmation from the bank itself that the transfer will go through. The transfer itself is not actually instant AFAIK, and it's definitely reversible (although not by the payer themselves).

If you tried to explain Bitcoin to a random stranger that you bumped into while grocery shopping as an analogy to e-mail and letters, they'll still have no idea what Bitcoin is and they'll most likely assume that you're trying to scam them. Think of the lady at the checkout, do you really think you can explain the Bitcoin protocol, the bitcoin currency, mining, cryptography, exchanges, peer to peer networking and all that other jazz to her?
If they end up using bitcoin, it's not because they actually understand it (nor should they have to), they'll use it because everyone else is already using it and it's been made foolproof.

This brainwallet site basically generates bog standard bitcoin private keys from a passphrase that you remember. Normally, bitcoin keys cannot be guessed at all, because there are so many possibilities that the universe would have died before you were able to try them all (you would be searching for all eternity). BUT, because on this website these keys are generated from a passphrase and everybody knows *how* those keys are generated from the passphrases, suddenly you only have to guess the right passphrase to find the private keys. Turns out that we humans are terrible at creating passphrases that are even remotely random enough that a fast computer cannot guess them. Worse still, *even the website itself* isn't random enough to prevent other computers from guessing the passphrase. Instead of searching and guessing for eternity, you can pretty much have a computer generate all "normal" ones (from a dictionary for example) and start monitoring them for any incoming transactions.
So, you can pretty much assume that any address generated from a passphrase that you can reasonably remember yourself without writing it down, regardless of whether it has been generated by the site or yourself, WILL be compromised in the near future if it hasn't already been compromised. To prevent this, use software that generates the private keys in a sufficiently random way that they cannot be guessed, such as the Bitcoin Core client.

Well for one you could explain the fundamental differences between a centralized trusted third party like Paypal and a decentralized network like Bitcoin that doesn't need one. Once they get that, they will probably ask why and how you could trust such a network, and the fact that the core Bitcoin implementation is open source is important to that. They don't have to understand anything about that, other than that it gives everyone the opportunity to verify at the most basic level that the protocol works, and that many have already done so independently.
That, in my opinion, is not something that we should trivialize as "just another protocol" like TCP/IP, because dismissing why and how it works in our explanations will leave the question of trust completely unanswered. They might trust Coinbase and Bitpay like they might trust Facebook, but what of the bitcoin that they paid good money for? Can they trust that? Consider for a moment what would happen if Facebook would endorse bitcoin, do you really think people would buy blindly into it in big masses without even a cursory idea of what bitcoin is? The stupid and naive might, but the rest would just as soon demand that Facebook explain what bitcoin even is.

The people should not be afraid of their governments as they are now, governments should be afraid of their people. Not as in terrorist activity afraid, but as in if we screw up they will definitely end our tenure quick-like.

I'm confused by his reasoning that passing private keys around is dangerous. I get that he doesn't like the idea of bitcoin ATMs printing out private keys, or people handing out pieces of paper with private keys on them, but that doesn't reduce the utility of paper wallets as a personal value store.
I mean, I have a bunch of bitcoin on keys that only exist on paper, it's my little paper bank and it's perfectly safe. I even split the BTC across several addresses so that I wouldn't have to load one private key will *all* my offline BTC, but instead I could load up the wallet in my Bitcoin Wallet app with 100mBTC. That is, if I could scan that damn code! Now I find that using a paper wallet as a personal value store is just not going to work if you use Bitcoin Wallet as your main hot wallet, I *have* to use another program or app to transfer that BTC from paper into that wallet.
So instead of keeping the balance in Bitcoin Wallet low so as to reduce the risk of getting it stolen, I'd be tempted to just let it accrue because I can't offload it safely. I can't very well send it to a Bitcoin Core or Multibit wallet, because I don't think it would be any more safe than it is in Bitcoin Wallet on my phone. Paper wallets would make way more sense, especially given the innate ability of the phone to easily scan the addresses for easy transfer to and from those wallets.

You're right, the exchanges *need* an order book and by extension there HAS to be BTC tied up in those orders. But many people who have their BTC on exchanges don't even have it in a sell order, they just have it there (unlisted) because they're too lazy to move it elsewhere, or don't know how to do that securely. I guess the same goes for fiat, but to a lesser extend.

The whole bitcoin community? Air-gapped storage of your private keys is best, and nothing says air-gapped like having them on a piece of paper.


With Mycelium, you can add the public keys of your paper wallet so you can watch them and receive payments on them. Then, when you want to spend bitcoin that was sent to one of those addresses, you can conveniently scan the corresponding private key and spend it, with change going to your hot wallet. There is no way to do this with the Schildbach client.
Importing a private key with Bitcoin Core or Multibit is easy enough, but you'd probably have to manually type your key in, which is a hassle. 
edit: Andreas Schildbach gives some info as to why this hasn't been done yet in this github issue: 
He is of the opinion that it doesn't make sense to add this because getting the necessary info (unspent outputs) would take too long. This is where Mycelium has the advantage of using a server that would be able to pull that info up instantly because it maintains a full copy of the blockchain. It looks like this problem cannot be solved without such a server.

Yes, they haven't educated themselves on what bitcoin is and why it would matter, so all they're doing is reacting based on what little they do know. But there's another way to react, and that is to see that the value has exploded over the years and get greedy. You don't have to educate yourself about the finer (or even the more coarse) points of bitcoin to want to buy some and get rich quick. It makes sense to read up on it when you're trying to buy some or just did, but that doesn't mean that everybody will do so.  Now imagine that someone didn't read up and that they just bought some on MtGox because that was how other people were doing it, would you still blame them for thinking that bitcoin has suffered a setback? Ignorance is not an excuse, but it is a fact of life.

No matter whether you choose the key or the software does it for you, a 12 word key is a 12 word key. What matters is that your vocabulary is limited compared to a computer's and that humans are terrible at picking random numbers, words or pretty much random anything. You will probably end up picking something that is easier to guess by several orders of magnitude.

2 factor authentication, something you know (password) and something you have (printed private key). The reason to print the private key instead of keeping it in an online wallet is to reduce the risk that somebody gains access to it. The reason to use a password is to reduce the impact if they do.

Yes, and you were wrong. It doesn't matter at all how much 1 BTC is, whether it's $1 or $1,000,000, $10 worth of bitcoin is just as easy or hard to purchase. In fact, I can guarantee you that if bitcoin were one million USD per, it would be super fucking easy to buy $10 worth of bitcoin, because there would be exchanges on every street corner. You would only be buying a tiny fraction of a BTC, but that tiny fraction would have as much purchasing power as the $10 that you exchanged for it.

For their reputation and their control over bitcoin and its future. They are literally saying "this is how bitcoin is going to be" in a reaction to others who have their own vision, and by saying it they are claiming authority over bitcoin where they have none. They know that, which is why they are trying to assert their authority by claiming to be the sole judges on what "consensus" means, thereby trying to impose their will on all bitcoin users and making it sound like it was their idea.
The only reason people are even paying attention to them now is because their opponents are still weak and divided, while they are united and well-funded. Well that and the fact that they have historically been the maintainers of the main bitcoin project. All it takes for them to lose their central position is for a few high profile miners to switch teams, and when that happens they will shatter and no one will want to fund them anymore.

I agree that increasing the limit that way would probably give them enough time to implement sidechains properly. However, I still think it's incredibly shortsighted to set a new limit at 8mb, because even with sidechains it could well be that we need way more if bitcoin really takes off. Setting the limit in a dynamic way that is explicitly designed to minimize the impact of any single agent or minority of agents is a much more robust way to handle this problem. Remember that the only reason this 1mb limit is was even implemented was to reduce the impact of a spam attack on the network, there is nothing inherent to bitcoin that requires us to limit the block size, and certainly not to something as small as 1mb. Chinese miners who have problems with their internet connections might find that power and labor cost aren't the only factors anymore in selecting a location for their farm, if they can't compete against people with good connections then that's their problem
@_date: 2016-01-11 09:53:58
Yes and then we have the same problem at 8mb, which is still laughably inadequate if bitcoin ever gets some real traction

That I agree with. I too would rather have this whole thing resolved one way or another before it's too late. However, for the purpose of answering the question in the OP people have to be aware that Core has always been against raising the blocksize limit like Satoshi lowered it from 32MB to 1MB. People also need to be aware that the reason these other implementations of bitcoin were/are being pushed is because other people found Core's answer to this question of "Why?" unconvincing. If Core were to cave and start arguing for on-chain scaling via a blocksize increase hardfork (combined with SegWit), a major part of the bitcoin community would start scratching their collective heads and asking "Why now and not 2 years ago?"
It's a deep hole they dug themselves and our whole community into, and even if BU were to disappear into thin air there's no telling if we can get out before the tide comes in

Minority? Why would anyone with an ounce of sense risk a fork without having a large majority of the hash rate supporting that fork? Like you said, it would be rejected by the rest of the network for not following the rules and any time/money invested in mining it would be lost. No, the only way anyone will risk a fork is if a large majority of hash power supports it, at which point the rest of the network will have to follow suit by making sure they're running compatible clients (preferably *before* the fork happens). We AGREE on that point, bitcoins consensus mechanism indeed does not give a fuck what we think. Also, the miners cannot risk forking the chain without knowing that the network is willing and able to accept the chain with the new rules, especially the nodes run by on-off points such as exchanges and wallet services. That's a check and balance in the system, preventing miners from doing something stupid like just increasing the block reward. They *could* do that, but without support from the rest of the network they'll find that their newly minted coins aren't worth anything anymore.
What surprises me is that people are treating the desire to increase the capacity of the network as if the miners just tried to change the block reward, rewind transactions or just plain steal BTC/award themselves all of satoshis coins. As if the bitcoin that we know now would suddenly cease to exist or become completely worthless just because slightly more transactions fit in a block.

Too bad for them then. Remember that they [promised to prepare a fork to 2MB and have it ready by July 2016 in order to fork in July 2017]( in order to coerce the miners to accept segwit. It would be a shame if Core were to fail to deliver on the agreement they fought so hard for
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:14:29
Yep, what your graph shows is that with 2mb blocks **all blocks** will be full by August 2017, no exception. What do you think that will do with the average time it takes for a transaction to be included? 2mb might be a good block size for right now, this instant, but it's wholly inadequate for even the near future, as you so aptly demonstrated for me

That you see it that way is the crux of this whole issue. Mike Hearn never wanted to destroy bitcoin or grab power in a coup, nor do any of the other people here arguing for on-chain scaling.

I don't. Apart from his actual programming work which I won't judge, he represents Core and Blockstream here on Reddit and he does a piss poor job at that. His presence here along with that of other Core members and Blockstream employees is one of the reasons that they can't get the community to accept SegWit and that BU seems poised to hard fork Bitcoin. If he was any good at representing the teams of which he is a member, or if he had refrained from representing them at all, there would have been less animosity towards Core. Instead he regularly ventilates his opinions here carrying the "bitcoin expert" badge, opinions that range from pretty normal to downright absurd, apparently doing so with no regard as to how that reflects upon himself, Core, Blockstream or indeed Bitcoin as a whole.

no, I'd say day trading bitcoin takes brass balls because if you day trade, you have to be convinced that you can out-smart the market to make a profit.

@_date: 2017-03-30 18:55:42
Depends on what they're trying to save from extinction, I'd say. In my opinion, there would be no need to fork to save Bitcoin, because the Bitcoin Unlimited chain would still be Bitcoin in every way that I care about. So if Core would fork to preserve their chain, I could only interpret that as a desperate attempt to keep themselves relevant especially since in my opinion a chain with a different PoW would diverge further from what Bitcoin is now than a chain with a variable block size. Of course, if in your opinion the 1MB block size limit is more important than the PoW on which Bitcoin has been running for the better part of a decade now, then you'd support the Core PoW fork. Or perhaps you don't care about the block size or PoW and you instead define Bitcoin not by how it works, but by who the current custodian is. That, in my opinion, is the antithesis of a decentralized cryptocurrency.

It doesn't mean nothing and it doesn't mean everything either. A block chain requires support from both miners AND the community, as do the developers that work on the client running that network and chain. You would do well to remember that before you alienate the last of your supporters
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:23:19
What is bitcoin? The answer developers give or even that miners give doesn't matter, what matters is what people trading bitcoin think it means, including exchanges and payment processors. If the exchanges and payment processors, online wallet services and people holding their own coin using their own wallets want to stick with a chain with only a quarter of the hashrate that the other chain has, then they are free to do so. If that chain were to slow down to a crawl because all the other miners jump ship to the other chain with the majority hashrate, then they are still free to call it Bitcoin. Whether anyone else accepts their definition of bitcoin is another question
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:54:34
Yes! If you know bitcoin unlimited will fail and it does fail, a fork will be a great opportunity to make some money off of the suckers who think it will succeed

oh? So if F2Pool were to switch to BU, you think Roger would be in control of their hash power? Or who do you mean by "they"? Because if "they" is Bitcoin Unlimited supporters/devs you'll find that they'll have just as much control over the bitcoin network after a fork as Core has now: precious little
@_date: 2016-01-11 12:05:01
*on average*, which means the capacity is already insufficient for peaks in usage like, oh I don't know, three days ago? God forbid that people actually start *using* the network because we would need many orders of magnitude more capacity if that is to happen

The term pre-mine implies that the developers or at least the very first adopters get an unfairly huge portion of all the coins. With a fork, every current holder just has two versions of their coin (one of which will die swiftly in the case of Bitcoin), how is that in any way comparable?

@_date: 2017-03-27 18:10:05
you're right, but we disagree on this


If Bitcoin is going to fork, the people who so far could ignore this whole situation suddenly have to make up their minds whether they want to stick with a rapidly dying minority chain or switch to something that the miners back. Note that they'll have to do this whether they intend to stick to Core or not, because in the event of well executed hard fork, the minority chain will have so little hashing power left that it will effectively be dead in days, if not hours. So if Bitcoin Unlimited triggers a fork at say 75% hashing power, Core will have to come up with either a difficulty reset or a change in PoW in order to keep their vision of Bitcoin alive, both which will require everyone to switch clients and switch quickly. It'll be another hard fork and there'll be 3 chains, only two of which will have any significant hashing power. Anyone sticking with the old Core client will be stuck on the original chain with as near as 0 hashing power as makes no difference (since miners will be jumping ship too). The question at that point is: will they switch to the new Core client with all that it implies (low hashing power or different PoW), or will they follow the miners who are mining what amounts to basically the same bitcoin as it ever was only with bigger blocks? The answer to that question also heavily depends on what they think Bitcoin is: is it what those people with warehouses full of ASICs are mining, or is it what Core says it is?

He is part of Core and Blockstream as officially communicated on their respective team's pages [here]( and [here]( and engages in arguments in their defense. You can argue all day long about how it's not actually representing Core and/or Blockstream if he doesn't actually preface his statement with "OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION FROM CORE:" and it won't matter, he engages in communication on their behalf on his own volition and gladly uses his association with Core and Blockstream to argue from a position of authority. Case in point: his tag as "bitcoin expert". If Core and/or Blockstream do not wish themselves to be represented by him on this forum, they should clarify that to him personally and publicly redact any statements by him as not being representative of their position. Any company worth their salt would have such a clause in the contracts with their employees or contractors anyway, and would forbid them from engaging in discussions on (social) media on the topic of Bitcoin for the duration of the contract unless *explicitly stated* that the statements following are not being made on behalf of that company. That's basic HR/legal stuff to protect the interests of the company and their investors
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:57:40
nobody has totalitarian power over bitcoin. If by some miracle bitcoin forks to Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic, the Core developers are more than welcome to return the favor with a fork of their own.

They're just trying to increase the capacity of the network, they're not *attacking* anything. They aren't changing the definition of bitcoin, they aren't rewriting history, they aren't stealing coins or awarding themselves more than we agreed on. They're just trying to change the hard coded transaction rate limit that was arbitrarily chosen years ago (as an anti-spam measure) and never meant to be permanent.

@_date: 2017-03-30 17:33:35
some people are counting on Core changing the PoW to fork away from Bitcoin Unlimited. If that happens we'll definitely have 2 chains
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:41:52
if you're confident in that assessment, you should immediately sell everything on the bitcoin unlimited chain if a fork happens, in order to maximize your holdings on the other chain. It's literally free money! Also, it would be good for people to disagree with you and think that bitcoin unlimited will prevail, otherwise who would you sell those coins to? The more people are convinced that bitcoin unlimited will win, the more buyers you'll have for your coin and the more coin you'll have on the chain you believe in.

Forgive me for this but I'm going to reply point for point:


You assume this will be the case but there's no way to be sure. The economics of scale will apply anyway


True, as will [the other client](


Pure speculation, as would any claim to the contrary be (like I speculated in my previous reply)


Yes, like Bitcoin has been for *years* now


they aren't changing the rules to try and enrichen themselves, they're only trying to uncork the capacity of the network


Pure speculation again. Like we agree, the original chain would be good and dead, the only viable chains would be 2 bitcoin chains both of which would not be conforming to the rules of the old bitcoin


the chain hasn't been attacked yet because it doesn't exist. You're right though the bugs do raise a concern about the code quality


Core would like nothing better than if they'd try that, there's no easier way to get everyone to switch back to a chain and network run by a Core client than having the then incumbent Bitcoin Unlimited developers mess with the BTC emission schedule/inflation control. That would be utter suicide and Core would easily be able to convince everyone *including me* to switch back to them because the original emission schedule is one of the major things that define Bitcoin (unlike the block size, btw)


they could, but you forget that they also have that ability *right now*. Miners have caused transaction backlogs before because they had voluntarily set the blocksize limit lower than 1MB to reduce orphan rate. Miners can mine empty blocks all day long if they wish to do so, and in fact the very last block at the time of writing is [**empty**]( [A few thousand USD in fees just left on the table.]( They don't need Bitcoin Unlimited to play OPEC


I wasn't planning to, only people who are absolutely sure one side will win would do that and those people have either seen the future or have completely closed their minds to reason


Hostile to whom? The bitcoin users? The only people who actually stand to lose everything here are Blockstream. Most other unaffiliated Core developers could probably contribute to Bitcoin Unlimited 
Again, sorry for replying in this shitty format that is the bane of heated internet debates. It's obvious we disagree entirely and that neither of us will convince the other anytime soon

@_date: 2017-03-03 07:39:06
How can you simultaneously believe that and this:


You just defined anything that does not conform to Core's client as an altcoin, effectively only allowing discussion of a bitcoin client if it's barely worth discussing at all because it boils down to a different interface and nothing else. That's OK, rename this subreddit to "Core's bitcoin discussion ONLY" and we're done here. You don't have to pretend anymore that this is an open discussion platform where we can discuss bitcoin's future and you can justifiably remove any discussion that does not concern the implementation of bitcoin by Core. All the other ~~altcoins~~clients have/had their respective subreddits, why not Core?
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:31:30

If your motivation is purely financial, why would you bother mining the losing side of a fork?
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:24:41


You're right as far as I can tell. So who actually communicates anything behalf of Core, if not the contributors themselves? Like you said, there are no representatives or a media department or official communications, so all we have to go on is what the people who make up the team say themselves about this topic on public forums such as these. If the rest of the Core contributors don't like that, they should come out of hibernation and say so. Until they do, I'm assuming they're fine with Luke announcing left and right that **Core** will change the PoW for example and that they agree


Do you?

your comment probably has the most upvotes but it's not the first one shown
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:01:52


that attack vector is part of the reason why the concept of PoW works. Miners on a minority chain cannot afford to stay on that chain partly because it would be shorter (and rejected by the network) and partly because it would not be secure against an attack from miners on the majority chain. They can't greedily mine a minority chain, the incentives are such that they have to switch to the majority chain
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:25:16


I guess, yeah. There's no reason why Core couldn't do exactly the same though, and if someone were ever so stupid as to seriously push for an emission schedule hard fork, then Core should easily be able to convince the miners to run their client again. It works both ways


if you think 10mb or even 100mb blocks are a significant cost factor in mining other than the orphan risk, AND you think Roger and Jihan are somehow immune to that, then I guess you'd have a point
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:22:38

@_date: 2016-01-09 15:53:35
5th **"**community**"** guideline of Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
That directly translates to "discussing bitcoin ideas that are different than mine is not permitted", because of how bitcoin nodes and mining power works each different client represents a different idea of what bitcoin is supposed to be. Ban the discussion of those clients and you ban the discussion of those ideas, which is EXACTLY what you have been doing.

Yes, so if the exchanges and payment processors switch to unlimited and the chain with the Core client stops being mined, would you say the culture has switched?

well the   and  top contributors to Core according to [this graph]( are founding members of Blockstream. If it weren't for their considerable contribution to the reference bitcoin client I don't think Blockstream would've attracted so much VC money
Do they *decide* where bitcoin goes? Probably not
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:25:36
Fair enough. I experienced the whole thing as Core and Blockstream basically only paying lip service to the idea of free discussion, and I'm sure most regulars over at the other reddit feel the same. I'm not sure how you can change that however, unless you basically cut ties with theymos completely and publicly denounce him, which might be going further than is warranted.

LN doesn't depend on fixing malleability and besides, SegWit definitely isn't the only or the best way to fix it. And even when LN works on top of bitcoin the on-chain transaction capacity still has to be massively increased if bitcoin+LN is going to achieve mainstream adoption. 1MB blocks are *not* going to cut it then

conservatively rolling out as needed should have started 3 years ago. What Core has been doing in the mean time is absolutely NOT conservative, they're claiming that operating the bitcoin network at the very limit is healthy and that high transaction fees are a good thing. They claim that bitcoin users should be happy to pay $10 for a transaction that takes hours or even days to confirm. If anything, the big blockers are the most conservative bunch because they don't want bitcoin to change much, they just want bitcoin to *grow*

No, I'm saying that the powers that be have decided against increasing the capacity time and time again. There have been many opportunities and many attempts, but none have succeeded, so if SegWit is a "take it or leave it" doubling of capacity then I don't see why this attempt should be successful where so many others have failed

SegWit alone does not fix the issue, it merely manages to squeeze in about 70% more transactions while actually consuming more bandwidth per transaction and not decreasing the storage requirements at all. The witness part of the transaction that won't be included in the 1MB block (to increase capacity and save space) still needs to be transmitted and stored, you see. It'll just be stored outside of the actual chain. Is that worth the significant departure from the way bitcoin has worked for the past 8 years, just to get 70% more capacity?


Absolutely. A 70% increase in capacity is just kicking the can down the road for a year, maybe 2 at the most.

I think average Joe would end up opening and closing a channel the same way they open and close an bank account.

Then why has any attempt towards a modest, *necessary*, increase of the blocksize limit been blocked so far? If Core had taken the initiative to increase the limit to 2MB (for example) while readying SegWit, I bet it would have been a lot easier for them to get SegWit accepted as they wouldn't have lost so much goodwill
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:33:34
yes, I'm just saying that the fact that a hard fork hasn't been triggered does not mean that the Core client has overwhelming support. That doesn't invalidate your argument based on node count

@_date: 2016-12-04 13:52:13
yes, but *when* can we have our decentralized low-fee cake and eat it too? Because this problem we're having *right now* was predicted years ago and the only readily available solution was dismissed for a myriad of reasons while all the other proposed solutions haven't actually materialized yet (including SegWit). BTW, as far as I'm concerned, the reason SegWit hasn't been activated yet is because Core lost the confidence of the community. If this ongoing shitstorm that they're at the epicenter of hadn't split the community as it has, they would've had a much easier time convincing everyone to support SegWit
@_date: 2016-12-27 23:36:52
BTC is not like Nvidia stock, nobody expects Nvidia to either fizzle out in 10 years or become bigger than Apple, Google and Microsoft combined. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 15:49:52
Well we can't have both, can we? In that sense, I think it's great that Core shot themselves in the foot repeatedly over the course of this whole debacle, if that means that bitcoin comes out stronger in the end with less centralized development. But, if we're looking to solve this problem *today* (not in a few month's time), we would have been in a better shape if development was as centralized as it was in 2013 and Core didn't have to rename itself to Core to begin with (in reaction to other clients/developers). Instead of trying to solidify their position via behind-the-scenes meetings with miners and heavy handed censorship that they may not have instigated but *definitely didn't rebuke either*, they could have retained more control by actually giving the community what they wanted.
If SegWit activates in time for the network to continue it's growth, that's definitely good in the short term. But whether that actually helps bitcoin in the long term, I don't know

How are blocks any bigger if their storage requirements don't change? If they fit more transactions, that's nice, *especially* when that's possible without increasing the storage requirements. But just an increased capacity to store transactions doesn't mean they're bigger, if you want to argue otherwise then you're arguing semantics (which is important too)

You should read up on bitcoin and keep your bitcoin on the exchange until you understand what it means to actually own bitcoin.

I hope you realize that many people bought into bitcoin precisely because of these grand claims that were made time and time again. If any core developers were there to calm the hysterical masses and talk some sense into them about how high fees would become inevitable and you'd never want to pay for coffee with bitcoin, then I don't remember seeing them. And neither did any of the (coffee) shops who became enamored with bitcoin and went through the trouble to start accepting it. Where were the warnings back then that trying to use bitcoin directly for small payments is the way of madness?
No, bitcoin, its message and the intended audience have definitely changed, and the transaction rate squeeze is a huge part of it. Let's hope that LN delivers because without it or something equivalent, bitcoin will not become a household name

Because at the time, anyone with a ruler and a chart of the transaction rate of bitcoin could have predicted that 1MB blocks would not be big enough for 2017. That was with the assumption of course that bitcoin adoption would increase, as we all hoped it would. Well guess what, adoption did increase and 1MB blocks have become too small. We could easily have done something about that 2.5 years ago by eliminating the 1MB block size limit, a limit implemented by Satoshi to protect against a spam attack [way back in 2010]( when the average block was about 10 *kilobyte* in size. 2.5 years now people have been calling for this limit to be removed, the last 2 of which theymos (supermoderator of this subreddit) declared any and all discussion about this verboten. For 2.5 years, the people in control of the main bitcoin repository have refused to increase the bitcoin transaction capacity limit [the way satoshi himself thought it should be]( opting instead to delay while condoning the censorship theymos did on their behalf. Eventually, the delay became "wait until SegWit is done", and when SegWit finally was done around november 2016, they had lost so much community goodwill due to their behavior in this debate that they couldn't even get it activated anymore.

History has proven that control over the bitcoin network is definitely not as decentralized as you'd think or hope. This subreddit is the prime example of that, because of how discussions like these (about increasing the bitcoin network capacity) have been *banned* for a long time. The 1 guy who has absolute control over this subreddit as well as bitcointalk.org decided in august 2015 that these discussions were not right for this subreddit and that we would only be allowed to discuss the bitcoin client that had achieved "consensus". How people would ever come to a consensus if no one was allowed to discuss any alternatives is a question that got answered with swift bannings and widespread "moderation" of discussions. John Blocke wrote a few blog posts on that topic that you should check out.


that is exactly what the people of Bitcoin Cash have decided to do. The miners are currently figuring out what they would rather support, SegWit or big blocks, and you can see it happen on websites that display the current hash rate, like this one:

Ethereum is not bitcoin, the difficulty adjustment is very different between the two which makes it very unlikely that a second Bitcoin chain with the same POW survives. And even if it does, it will still be extremely vulnerable to a 51% attack from any of the miners on the other  (more secure) chain

No it is not. The discussion was attempted and thwarted, and in the process multiple people/teams developed multiple alternative clients to the reference client after desperately trying (and failing) to convince the developers of said reference client of the inevitability of the shitstorm that we're currently experiencing. Notable examples are BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. You're going to dismiss these, because otherwise you wouldn't have asked this question or suggested that a BIP/mailing list discussion would have been effective where the general discussion on and bitcointalk.org was already being censored to remove any trace of aforementioned alternative clients or discussions about improvements to the reference client.


Keep in mind that Theymos is also admin of what was then the only other big and public venue for bitcoin discussion: bitcointalk.org. His singular decision to censor both these forums definitely had a huge impact. To call it "heavy moderation" is an insult to all the people who spoke up and gotten banned


Depends. It's definitely a shitpost, but the fact that it was upvoted, sparked a discussion (including contributions by and was then promptly deleted shows that this subreddit has still not gotten past the destructive behavior that is still harming bitcoin as a whole.

How does any of this matter to people who can't afford $0.50+ transaction fees? They'll never run nodes from their homes anyway. If you're going to argue that bitcoin nodes should be able to be run by everyone to keep bitcoin decentralized, you should also argue for bitcoin to be *affordable* to everyone, which it already isn't. For people like us who can afford using bitcoin in its current state, it doesn't matter what kind of home internet connection we have because we can also afford to run bitcoin in a datacenter if we wish to do so.

Well if a fork happens and the chain with the majority of the hashpower doesn't fit your definition of bitcoin, then you're welcome to not use it.

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:02:21


But that's the problem: you can't. They can just retroactively change the data, recalculate the hashes and then what are you going to say, that your copy of the blockchain is the legitimate one?  Remember that the whole thing was centralized to begin with, so everybody who wanted/needed to get in on it had to get their data from that source most likely, because how do you know who else can be trusted? Certainly not the guys who aren't even paying you any transaction fees because that is the prerogative of the central authority. You could have all the nodes check and hash and do their blockchainy things if you want to, but are they ever going to reject the chain that the central node keeps publishing? If they reject it, they just end up forking from the only people that gave the blockchain any legitimacy and any transactions they process will just end up invalid.

@_date: 2017-04-01 10:12:40


SegWit is not a compromise, SegWit is what you have been campaigning for for the last 2 years and it has so far been rejected. The compromise is the one you mentioned with a 2MB hard fork, and need I remind you that Core *already promised* to implement this compromise, with the proposed scheduled hard fork taking place July 2017?
I do think it would be for the best if SegWit activated sooner rather than later but don't pretend like Core has been so kind as to make a compromise with the part of the community that demanded on-chain scaling before you guys finally finished SegWit. You haven't made any compromise, all you've done is what you always said you would, and you took your sweet time doing it (remember when SegWit was supposed to be done April 2016?). That you haven't compromised at all is the reason we're in this shitstorm to begin with: if you'd listened to the community back when BIP101 was suggested then you wouldn't have alienated them and SegWit would've been right on track to be activated.

The software was perfectly capable of calculating a reasonable fee that always worked, right up until the blocks got full. Don't confuse cause and effect here, the only reason that you'd need RBF to increase the fee of a transaction is because the blocks are saturated and it is therefore impossible to predict how high the fee should be. The solution is not to fix the symptom of transactions not being included, but to fix the root cause of the problem: insufficient block size. Of course the core developers know this, which is why they want to increase the block size as well, but not until they've delayed it long enough to use it as an excuse to cram in the other features that are supposed to fix this but won't, because they are meant to prepare for LN instead.
This whole situation should have been prevented a full year ago with a hard fork to a new sensible block size limit. The core developers should have been the ones guiding that process. The very fact that we're still having this discussion right now is the reason that they have lost confidence from a major part of the bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:27:38
LN doesn't require SegWit
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:01:01


Except when there was no congestion, it would have been really easy to say that the fee is just too low. Now, we can only guess whether it was actually too low to be included at all or just too low to be included in a timely manner. But no matter, RBF will surely make this go away magically

? OK help me explain the timeline here then:
* community starts demanding more capacity
* Core states SegWit will increase capacity even with 1MB blocks
* community says SegWit won't be done on time
* Core does X to compromise, in order to win support for SegWit
What is X? What has been done to compromise? Because remember, the increase in transaction capacity that SegWit will bring *already was Core's main argument* to delay any and all blocksize limit hard forks in favor for SegWit.

I welcome you to prove me wrong on that allegation, but if you did you'd end up with no good reason to continue stifling the bitcoin discussion with your hamfisted removal of topics and *people*.


People could see good XT discussions and arguments on this subreddit just fine until you started burning the metaphorical books

How you can even take yourself seriously anymore is beyond me. You're acting like a dictator while discussing a system *specifically designed* to run without such a central authority. Do you not see how your actions are directly hurting that which you are trying to protect?
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:03:31
so when it comes back down, will you sell again at $250 to save yourself from losing anymore dollars? Sounds like a losing strategy so far
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:56:35
oh yeah that one was introduced in august I guess. Joke's on them though, every HD7950 is a 'boost' edition if you move a slider or two to the right :D

no man, watch! I drew some lines on this chart here, THAT'S why it's different this time!
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:03:46
you believe that everyone who wants to use bitcoin should run a full node? If so, that really does explain this discussion here because you'd be more deluded than I thought
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:04:22
WHY ARE WE ~~YELL~~BUYING
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:54:38
Bragging? You're implying that *personally* got bitcoin to $300, and apparently you know what "smart money" does so I guess that means you must be pretty smart too, huh?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:56:54
I could still have made a killing with litecoin though, if my crystal ball was on top of its game
Also, I don't know where you're looking but I bought my HD7950 in the first week of February 2012
edit: look here: 
in the table under the header "launch" it says 31st of Januari 2012. I ordered mine that day, it was available in quantity from day 1

I imagine you could circlesuck just as well as you can circlejerk, so there's no need for 69

They will probably try and sue the big shops on open bazaar that they are in direct competition with. They don't even necessarily have to win, as long as they can get the shop offline for a while on some bullshit 
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:51:23
Ok, I may have miss-worded that. Yeah the nodes handle it just fine, by the rules they agree upon. The blocks get full though, and once they're full all the time with transactions with reasonable fees, you'll have to start paying unreasonably high fees to get your transaction in. That's how it is right now and how it would be with blocks of any size. If blocks topped out at 100kb right now instead of 1Mb, would bitcoin be feeling the squeeze?
@_date: 2015-11-17 06:46:15
You mean just about everybody? Because if waiting an hour to have any idea whether the transaction will go through is going to be typical of bitcoin, it will forever remain the plaything of a deluded group of nerds
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:36:29
Opening an account at Coinbase and storing a lot of bitcoin there definitely take computer skills, or you will see your account hacked and your bitcoin stolen

Depends, are miners with MILLIONS worth of equipment poor? Is your average bitcoin *enthusiast* poor? These are rhetorical questions by the way.

I got an HD7950 at launch day to use for gaming. I had heard of bitcoin but dismissed it as a scam
I could have mined the shit out of it, had I paid attention
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:59:59
People should open their windows, smell the flowers and realize it's almost 2016 and we're not on fucking 56k6 modems anymore
Besides, not everybody needs to have google fibre, only the miners and people who want to run a node need a good connection. Miners especially have no excuse at all, those miner pools that balk and say they can't get a good connection should have thought of that before they went and built their facility in a bandwidth-poor location. I say fuck them and their ASICs, if they can't keep up and drop out then that's just a big wobble on the hashrate graph and more BTC for the rest of them
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:21:43

Ok so bitcoin is trading a lot right now because stuff is happening, right? Now fast forward 2 years from now, maybe bitcoin is doing even better and not only are people trading it more and at higher prices, people are even using it to pay for stuff! Can you imagine how big the blocks need to be in order to handle all those transactions?
If you think bitcoin can *grow* just fine with 1MB blocks, then I'm curious as to what your solution is for all those transactions that won't fit in anymore. Simply bumping the maximum block size is not a definite solution either, but at the moment it is at least an option.
@_date: 2015-03-02 06:49:26
Do you think people use good passwords on etrade, or anywhere else for that matter? Because if you do, you're (mostly) wrong. And the difference between etrade and coinbase is that the very nature of bitcoin makes it easier to steal and get away with it. You can't steal stock like you can steal bitcoin.

Why does OP have to be a sock puppet to point out that the current nodes are at their limits? Does that imply that he has a specific agenda to push?
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:51:53
Yes and if you explain it to them, the answer to that question is "no" because you can't easily send money using bitcoin. You can send bitcoin easily, you can even show it to them, and then they ask how do they get bitcoin so they can use that to send money and they immediately stop being interested because it's a bother and using Paypal is much easier. The ones that will keep listening are the ones who got fucked by Paypal and want to know how to do get it done without also throwing money at them.

Well somebody somewhere has to know all about it, and that somebody could have left the company. Now what do they do with the payment method that nobody knows about and not many actually use? Try and get someone to learn about it or just axe it?

Satoshi's original paper should not be modified, if they feel it no longer represents bitcoin as they see it they should remove it or create a separate document outlining their vision of bitcoin and how it relates to satoshi's vision. Changing it in any way is going to be seen as rewriting history, no matter how small the changes are going to be, because satoshi is not around anymore to defend his version.
