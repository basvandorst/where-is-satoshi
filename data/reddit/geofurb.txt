was talking out of his ass, I found a free service:
@_date: 2017-03-30 04:20:36
There's no database for wallets whose identity is public knowledge?
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:37:16
It's exactly what I was asking for, though; a database of info on publicly known wallets' owners.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:38:55
Which are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:35:54
Ahhh. I'm not interested in dormant wallets, so I guess I'm lucky!
@_date: 2016-05-28 12:02:34
Seriously, is it that high?!?

I was looking at unconfirmed transactions from here:
@_date: 2016-05-29 00:43:52
Is there an easy way to resolve the to/from addresses in a transaction?
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:28:44

@_date: 2016-05-28 16:45:58
Right. I'm looking for the percent of TX in that feed that *will not* be confirmed, because they are wrong for whatever reason.
@_date: 2016-05-28 12:05:38
I'm looking to see, whenever a block is published, a ledger of every transaction approved in that block.
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:04:38
Aren't the outputs scripts, though? Can't they be pretty arcane to parse? I thought it wasn't as simple as address in, address out.
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:14:12
OK, so you see the websocket API that I'm looking at? It streams a bunch of transactions that haven't yet been confirmed. I'm trying to figure out what percent of those will eventually be confirmed.
