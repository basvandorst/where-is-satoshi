Wouldn't be surprising if traders put $600m worth of btc into tether over the weekend. 
Add up all the btc/usdt volume over that time on all the exchanges using tether, its a small fraction.

There is an audit, by a large multinational firm. Perhaps finex paid them off to throw away their entire business? Because that's exactly what will happen to Friedman LLC if it all comes crashing down.

I have no problem paying taxes for efficient evidence-based government services/infrastructure.
The problem is that govts all across the western world have proven themselves utterly incapable of managing taxpayers money over and over. They are all in debt with no plans to get out. 
If a family member comes to you for money but then throwing it all away and then asking for more, you'd get that person help, not keep giving them money. 
The short term incentives for politicians do not match the long term requirements of taxpayers.
I'm at the point where I don't want to vote for politicians anymore, only want to vote on where tax dollars are spent.

Uhh, suspect you are making up figures at random there. Here's a research team that managed very well by themselves to make a dodgy chip.
Even the simplest IC's like a 555 timer are impossible to verify without sophisticated equipment. Unless we make chips the size of your hand you have to accept it's a matter of trust. 
Only electrical components are verifiable easily, IC's are an entirely different beast. A possible solution is to keep it simple and use ubiquitous IC's that can be resoldered in for the most paranoid.
 TAO has 1000's of employees who intercept and replace components in electronics regularly. This is an acknowledged fact. 
Anything on a chip scale is ripe to be exploited. It's not like govt employees haven't stolen coins on a whim before.

And giving a few people absolute control isnt going to be abused? It's being abused right now. 
Every year i put in a tax return, every year i should get a say where it goes, 1 tax return 1 vote. I don't care if it's non binding, at least it would be clear for everyone that the govt of the day doesn't respect the will of the people. 
 I know the collective decision making of a country is superior to anything done by politicians doing whatever necessary to stay in power.

It's inflating at ~700,000 btc per year. Not to mention the Mt. Gox trustee handing out another 160,000 soon. 
That's well over 5% this year. The usd is inflating at 3%.
It will be years before btc inflates less than usd and even then its still inflating, a deflationary currency would have its actual  supply reduced every year, not the opposite.
