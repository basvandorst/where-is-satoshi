Thanks for all the explanation, shorting seems like extremely dangerous but at the same time i get why some people feel drawn by it, the possibility to make lots of cash, it seems like a casino where people even sell their wife to try to make a big profit :/
Just curious how is it possible for a bank to demand 300K from someone who was gambling with just 3k?
@_date: 2017-01-10 10:11:41
Oh i see very good explanation thanks

Damn son, you actually had 10,000 bitcoins on your hard drive? Thats 9 Million by todays price jesus christ! :/
P.S: When you said the hd blew up you mean it started having the the click of death ?

Care to explain how the leverage works? If he just lost 500K who is going to pay back the lenders their 9.5M?

I dont use default Ubuntu for a long time only use xubuntu and lubuntu since they are lighter didnt knew it looked like that now :)

So why didn't the owner kept a close eye on bitcoin price in order to avoid loosing the money? I mean 10 million is a lot to mismanage like that
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:55:04
Holy crap! They went bankrupt for shorting?
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:32:14
I heard about bitcoin in 2010 or 2011 and didn't think much about it for 3 reasons:
1 - Governments will never let something like bitcoin to flurish
2 - I didn't knew it was capped to 21 million
3 - Heard you could mine it really easily so i thought with many people were getting hundreds and hundreds of bitcoins and because
Bitcoin reminded me of Bit i associated there would be trillions and trillions of it in the future so they would never have any kind of value or at max reach $0.10 each.
Oh boy i just wish i could go back in time and slap myself really hard lol
With this i mean that sometimes you can hear about something and don't think too much about it and later realize how you missed the train

Ok i am noob at trading, for what i know shorting is associated with earning money while the asset is decreasing in value. Didn't know that you could lose all money doing this, so i guess shorting is like betting? So the user who lost $10 Million could have won another $10 Million if bitcoin went up?
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:56:28
Oh right! So when you short you cannot stop the order until you win or you lose?

Just curiuos what s.o. are you using? 
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:41:15
I understand your point but that would be like giving someone some millicents of a currency they dont know and when they realize its a tiny fraction of a single coin you can guess what will be their reaction.
I heard of bitcoin a long time ago but only joined the ship of crypto when dogecoin was created. By the time the bitcoin price for 1 coin was so high that it became instantly a big turn off for me. Thats because how human mind works you like to feel that you have tons of something and not fractions. 
I tried using just bits but somehow its not the same thing to me
But please go ahead and talk to someone who never heard of bitcoin and reach the part where you say 1 bitcoin = &gt;$200 and how you can use it as day to day currency. Even our minds deal better with int values!
I really think changing the main units to bits instead of bitcoins would really help the adoption

Just been researching about this, you use something like  for rss? But how do you determine the rsi? And what do you mean by "when it reaches +1/-1" I am a newbie in this kinda of things
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:27:55
lol ��
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:34:24
Yes, but there also the risk that you sell at a particular price and you expecting it go down and then it won't or even go up. I seen that you say that holding is dangerous, but every time i tried to sell at a particular price i end up regretting it or even loosing money. Normally holding proved to be a lot better then day trading in my case. Its really hard to keep updated about everything whats happening in the ecosystem, unless your life is looking at reddit, charts and crypto news
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:44:17
What do you mean by rsi?
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:20:07
Damn you seem to have real experience in trading currencies, i assume you have a background in finance. Does having a server that that automates trades works for you? I ask this because i read that the software developed for high frequency in Wall Street costs millions upon millions just to get it right
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:26:02
Very interesting! I suppose that if you trust your algorithm its because most of times it does the right thing! You used something like nodejs to automate everything? Anyway even if it's a small operation assuming you have several indicators it most have took you quite a while to develop your system

I can't think that this is most likely a deliberate move from the US to crash prices and let some major players buy on the cheap? Come on this doesn't even make sense its like those times someone said "China is banning bitcoin!"
