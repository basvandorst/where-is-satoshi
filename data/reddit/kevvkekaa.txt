These are some great steps pineapple fund. A word of caution while you are generously giving away charity, please make sure these NGOs are not some corrupt politician backed or fraud ones. Because many NGOs are fraud and their whole existence is based of swindling good folks like you!

OP in india you can hire head hunters anywhere from 3-5k. 10k is a lot! Are you sure they are in India?if they are in india, its not that hard to find them, if they have used these real names.
Right now in India a new social security system is in full implementation, its called Aadhar and anybody trying to move over 1k$ in Indian currency from a bank account would need an "Aadhar" card. 
So, if i was you, i would approach a cyber police station in Indian big cities like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai or Bangalore.
Tbh you can basically bribe a cop in any of these above stated police stations and track down these crooks based on the Aadhar cards. As a phone number, address might be tied down to those bank accounts which can be retrieved based on AADHAR ID card. 
I would say approach any of the above police stations, investigate locally to find out which cop is willing to head hunt for money and viola, your work will be done.
 But just an FYI, this can be one of many scenarios to find them in India and if you are willing to tackle the indian system, trust me its going to be real frustrating, but with the right connections and money anything can be done.
I hope you find your bitcoins man, cheers!
Edit: I just found out if you can get their AADHAR ID numbers, you can even retrieve their PASSPORT info using the above cyber police divisions. I highly suggest to look into one of those main city cyber divisons, approach a cop, usually that cyber station CI or SI and negotiate this same offer, i would say they will do your job by taking anywhere from 4k-10k$ USD, but mind you dont reveal how much money you going to retrieve from them because then they will ask for a % of the retrieved money so if its 100k, they will ask for straight up % from that!
