I want to warn you against Butterfly and mining in general.  Read [my account of buying the almost the exact miner you want to get](
It's 18 days later, and we made 8BTC during that time.  We are trying to beat back $10k, which we will.  But if we just bought bitcoin with that ten grand in April when the unit was ordered ( per BTC), we'd have $70k instead of $7k and an electric bill.

Unless in hindsight your plan is wrong.  Like, you know, when the precious metals crowd had a written-down plan to keep buying silver at $38 and gold at $1,800.

You can say that about anything.  They don't have to be "back" in our lifetime.  Neither does BTC.  The point I am making is that having a plan and sticking to it is not enough.  No well-thought out, meticulous dollar-cost-averaging BTC purchase plan will save you if in hind sight BTC turns out to be just an experiment.

Electric and cooling is around $9-10 a day, so it's really not a concern in the grand scheme of things.  If I can maintain 0.6BTC/day around the clock and the price stays above $200, the break-even is in a few months.  
In terms of getting into the game ... I can't advocate anyone spending tens of thousands of dollars on anything that they are not very familiar with.  I've been mining, trading, and working for BTC for a while, just not on this scale.  It's like buying vacation property in another state that you've never been to versus buying a couple of acres on the water close to your house -- one is an uncomfortable crapshoot and a potential money pit, the other is likely a nice getaway.
Edit: obviously rising complexity considerations -- I'm taking at current rates.

Yeah that's a popular sentiment

What's the value add?  They both look like no fee pools.
