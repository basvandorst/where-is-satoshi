Yeah, why didn't they think of that when Dickens wrote? 
Besides that hilarious joke, this would be the part where monopolies come into play.  
In a perfect world where people cared about everyone else libertarianism would be grand. I used to espouse it's worthless tenants myself so I'm not judging you too harshly. One day I luckily came upon some new information that showed me what a total dumbass I was.

Well, take a look at working conditions now and then imagine them bring worse. We are already, in America, easily within the injustice range. Most employers don't even have to provide a living wage. Even a slave is give room, board, clothing, and transportation to work. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 07:06:54
Just because something is worse doesn't make your parties fallacious policies acceptable. Favored business is favored business. 
I'd disagree though, besides my above point. For example, Libertarianism is against corporate welfare. Seems good on its face until you realize that means libertarians actually favor monopolies.

I agree and the labor of those robots should be shared seeing as the right to be a hunter gatherer has been taken away from us. Not to mention 100% employment is not only an impossibility it's also the last thing employers want. We can either make sure the people at the bottom have enough or prepare for the upcoming revolt. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 20:00:53
I used to lean libertarian until I realized two things. Libertarianism will always favor corporations over labor and the sales tax only plan won't work because the rich will simply import cheaper goods because "smuggling" won't be a crime any more. 
In America we already have two parties that favor corporations over labor so we don't need s 3rd thanks tho.

Ha! We have a model. It's not like we don't know what happens without regulation. That's why we gave regulations. They'd lower the working age to zygote if they could. So it's not that we disagree about injustice, it's that you're wrong about it. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:31:02
It's a pretty strong argument considering that's what was done. Child labor, no off days, no overtime, just some of the joys you can look forward to in a libertarian society.

Property rights are created through threat of violence. Do I believe in them? It's a stupid question. It's like asking if I believe in owning slaves. Property rights were created by, SPOILER ALERT, people who had already violently claimed land they had no rights to. If you really believed in property rights you'd give whatever property you have back to the natives and take your ass back to Europe with the rest of the landed gentry. So now I'll ask you u/glibbertarian...
Do you believe in property rights?

Are you insane? Like, literally? 
In 1890, Standard Oil controlled 88% of the refined oil flows in the United States. At the turn of the century, the company controlled 91% of oil production and 85% of its final sales.
If that's not a monopoly I don't know what is. But here are some more.
De Beers
US Steel
American Telephone and Telegraph
Some current examples would be
Luxottica, 80% of sunglasses belong to them
Monsanto, which you've eaten today. They control nearly 80% of the worlds corn supply.

Then put your money where your mouth is and give all your property back to its "rightful" owners, the native Americans. Or be a hypocrite like your hero Ayn Rand who accepted Medicare. "She paid in" some will say. How does that excuse taking part in a system she claimed to despise?
I implore you, give up your future rights to Social Security, unemployment, welfare, disability, or whatever other evil socialist schemes may arise. Make a decision for your future self to shun all the programs regardless of personal misfortune. I'll bet you won't. 
The initial act of claiming land is both a direct threat of violence and an act of theft. You CANNOT be perturbed in the slightest when those same actions are used against you. Bend over and take it. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:07:58
You don't understand reality. Therefore the answer to your question is no. 
Reality is, nobody owns land. You obviously refuse to accept the reality of this. If you think you own some land, kill your self and watch what happens to it. 
Land is claimed, through threat of violence. Therefore if you claim land through threat of violence, you cannot be upset she threat of violence is used against you. It's as simple as simple gets. 
If you think you live autonomously and have no responsibility for how your actions affect the lives of others, you're a sociopath. 
A sociopath can be defined as a person who has Antisocial Personality Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a disregard for the feelings of others, a lack of remorse or shame, manipulative behavior, unchecked egocentricity, and the ability to lie in order to achieve one's goals.
@_date: 2016-09-07 12:18:21
This is first grade logic here. I'll walk you through it again.
The first person who ever claimed a parcel of land did so through the threat of violence. But what gave them the right to claim that parcel in the first place? They were born first? They found it? No. The earth belongs to all of us. 
So, again I'll ask this simple logic question and absolutely dismiss your erroneous "wrong" comment, which is where I immediately stopped reading your comment as that made it obvious you're clueless as to how shit actually works. If you hold land that you had no right to claim as yours in the first place, no matter if you bought it because it was originally stolen, how can you be upset if violence is then threatened against you? That's called having your cake and eating it too. Do you think you can buy a stolen car and then claim that it's yours? Sociopath
 Libertarian horse shit. 
The first person that fenced off a piece of land stole it. That gold in the ground is ours. That water in the river is ours. Those trees, animals, fish, they're everybody's. Not the first swinging dick to walk up on them and not the person who has the most pulped trees with green ink on them. There is a reckoning coming, and people who think like you do are in for a very rude awakening.

You hope I live long enough to see child labor and monopolies? You hope I live long enough to see the Koch brothers own more than the Waltons? You're some kind of disillusioned. 
Taxes are the price you pay to live in a civilized society. If you don't like it move to Bangladesh. You'll get to keep almost all of the $500 a year you earn there. 
As far as the beyond goes, have you seen what we've done to this place? We are like the 16 year old who destroys the car dad bought us but promises the next one will be really taken care of this time, honest. Pinky swear  ¯\_ツ_/¯
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:52:03
You want to force me to stay off certain parcels of land, so that destroys your argument instantly. You want to force me from access to my resources and you want to force me from having a say in how corporations operate while using my resources and affecting my air, water, and environment in general. Your claim of "wanting to leave people alone" is lacking any form of intelligent thought whatsoever. It's just a buzz phrase, and a poor one.
I gave several examples.
I've never supported a "big powerful government." I simply pointed out that we don't currently have one, as you just admitted.  I support the smallest government possible. A government of one. So, no need to let any sinks in. You seek to oppress with your vote. You seek to use the violence of your vote to subjugate others to your fallacious policies. Let that sink in.
The planet belongs to all of us. What you make in a certain country is a function of living in that country. I wasn't born a Walton. Despite evil taxes they still own more wealth that the bottom 40% of Americans. What a plucky little bunch they are. At what point would you find issue with this? If they owned 99% of the wealth would you lay beside me starving and praise a system that would undoubtedly make them even more wealthy? 
Would you make all men impotent in your zealous efforts to end these rapes you akin taxes to? Do you not understand that just because someone was born earlier than you or to a wealthier family then you still shouldn't be condemned to a life of poverty? Who would take care of the disabled? Do you care about the rape that would occur to them? What about the rape of our labor? It's not like I have the ability to become a hunter gatherer. I can't hunt deer enough to feed and clothe my family for the year. Even what I'm allowed to hunt I have to pay beforehand to do that. I know someone's already blaming the evil GUBBAMINT for that but, who do we think proposes these laws? I say corporations that want me to buy there goods instead of having the ability to make my own. 
We are all FORCED to work. It's not a goddamned voluntary action. Money is a NECESSITY in this capitalist society. Who makes it that way? Who creates the curriculum in the schools that helps keep American's dumb? Again I can see everybody reaching for the government card. But think about this. Lets say you and I go into buisiness to create new textbooks designed to better educate our citizens about the Fed, which I'm assuming is something we both hate. Well, we are gonna need a loan, aren't we? Were will we go to get that loan? Most likely a bank. I wonder which bank will finance our books designed to bring their very lifeblood to its knees? Not even one. 
Standard Oil. I gave several examples earlier but there's one. Concrete enough for you? 
Finally, Those two things are not mutually exclusive. It could easily be argued the government isn't big enough to control corporations but I'm not going to. I'll argue that government does need to be smaller. I'd be very happy with the smallest government I can think of in the last 500 years. 5'7" Napoleon. Monarchs are beholden to the people, not the landed gentry. Our politicians are bought and paid for. That's why I've long advocated paying our elected officials much larger salaries.  
 
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:16:52
Nothing's being taken from anybody. That's what you're missing. I'd allow you the argument that the appropriation of OUR taxes is in a terrible place. If our taxes were properly appropriated you'd have no choice but to appreciate it unless you were certifiably insane. But OUR taxes go to buy bombs and I can understand a fellow citizen being upset about that.   The money you get is a function of being an American. Your employer figures in how much taxes you'll pay before they offer a salary. They make a donation in your name. 
But some some are born stupid, ugly, crippled, blind, etc. and those people WILL NOT, nor should they, live in poverty for much longer. You can't have winners without losers. If everybody where Einstein we'd still need ditched dug and pizzas to be delivered.

Not to mention power companies nation wide. There's one electrical company in my area. sure I could live off candles and chopped wood, but I couldn't really. Electricity has become a necessity. My kids would be at an extreme disadvantage without the internet. On top of that, have you applied for a job lately? They don't do that on paper anymore. And how are people to get to their jobs? Auto transport has become a necessity as well. With money as a necessity, nay, THE necessity, the items it takes to make money are also a necessity. The poor have never been poorer. That means the free market has failed them miserably. Without a car, alone, you've got no chance at climbing out of poverty in this society. It's a joke and history will not judge this era kindly in terms of how we've treated our fellow man. This is a collective. We are in this together. Like it or not, it's an absolute fact.

Your policy is not to leave everybody alone. That sociopath thinking is the rotten core of whats wrong with libertarian ideology.
How many examples do you need? By claiming neutrality you side with the oppressor in any given situation. Take the no income tax disaster. Make it sales tax you say then it's a "choice." Well, what happens is the rich will then import their goods. Since smuggling won't be a "crime" There will be no way to tax the rich. Will libertarians do anyting about that? No. Thus they'll be playing favorites by siding with the oppressor. Libertarians will always play favorites with corporations as well. Will you deny them making children work again? Will you help combat monopolies? Will you implement work place safety? Environmental regulations? No. You'll play favorites. 
Corporate welfare is in place to combat monopolies. I would agree that it's in a horrible state of affairs right now but the idea, overall, is not something "anybody with a brain" should be against. 
The free market creates competition? How many more Reagan buzz phrases will you mindlessly spew? The free market favors monopolies thus stifling competition lol. 
Government is currently controlled by corporations. To state otherwise would only serve to prove yourself an intellectual cripple. A glaring example would be this $500 epipen debacle. Pharmacists cannot offer the generic version unless the doctor specifically writhes the prescription that way. That's by federal law. Now, what would the government have to gain from that law? Did they write it up themselves on a whim? No. Their bosses wrote the law for them and had them implement it.  
I used to be as stupid as you but I doubt you'll ever be as wise as me.

Taxes buy your safety. Unless you want protecting your posssesions to become your new favorite hobby you best get used to it. 
I've got a news flash for you, the money in your possession isn't yours. Pull out one of the bills or coins. You'll clearly see it says "U.S Government" on it. I've yet to see any of your money floating around. I'm willing to bet it's quite worthless if it even exists. The money you earn is a function of being an American. That's why doctors in Ethiopia and doctors in America make different salaries. That Ethiopian tax rate tho. Swoon. Am I right? 
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:53:59
The government doesn't claim any of your money. If you pull out the money in your possession you'll see, clearly, it says US Government right on there. We the people provide that money for you. Your ability to earn some of it is a product and function of you being in America. You're welcome in advance. You're free to start using your money if you like though I'm gonna warn you I doubt very seriously anybody will accept it. 
Feel free to move to Bangladesh if you don't like the American system snd all it provides, including a currency that's valued worldwide. You'll get to keep almost all the $500 a year you earn there.

And I have to attack your "greater charity through no tax burden" argument as well. In 1981 Reagan, by far the worst president ever, dropped the corporate tax rate from [70% to 28%. ]( Did those corporations use that lifted tax burden to pass on savings to consumers or to pay their employees more? No. They used it to destroy unions and fight to keep the minimum wage as low as possible...

It’s important to point this out to the Scientism crowd though. Science is basically throwing shit on the wall and seeing what sticks. It gives us value sometimes, and often horrors. There’s no reason it should be the fastest growing religion in the world right now but assuredly, it is...

Yeah it does lol. What would you be *Trying* if it didn’t? The mental gymnastics on display would be impressive if I didn’t know you were just obviously brainwashed. 
The main reason Scientism is a religion is it places man at the pinnacle of understanding. Like the observations of bald plain apes, who don’t even have the best senses of the animals on its own planet, are universally binding. The hubris is astounding.

Everything is force. If you own property, which is theft in and of itself, are you not owning it through threat of violence? How then can you be upset if violence is used against you since the very act of owning anything comes with the threat of force?

It’s also a far better method to destroy the earth. Global warming, nuclear bombs etc. 
The point, which you widely missed, is that trial and error and learning doesn’t need fancy names that lend it more credence. So why do it? Because it competes with the other religions for money, of course.
