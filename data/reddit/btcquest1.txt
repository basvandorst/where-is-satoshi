It isn't a question of do we take a few % loss or quit mining. It's a question of whether I take a few % loss or a 0% loss. Every business will choose 0%. Why would miners choose to reduce profit?

Have you ever used an SPV wallet, for example any wallet on a smartphone? They rely on non-mining nodes to function. If a government controlled all non-mining nodes they could blacklist tx's people send from SPV wallets (think all smartphones unless manually configured to connect to nonmalicious full nodes that miners use) and prevent them from propogating to the network because they wouldn't relay the tx from the spv wallet on your phone to other nodes connected to miners. You are relying on (sometimes) non-mining full nodes to relay the tx from your spv wallet on your smartphone to nodes connected to miners who will actually propogate your tx. If the non-mining nodes your wallet relies on chooses not to relay your tx then it will not propogate to the network unless you manually push it through a known reliable node.

1.  Here is some working code implementing these ideas. Another project is 
2. If every person on earth made 2 tx's per day we would need 24GB blocks. If every person on earth made 2 channels per year with *unlimited* transactions we would only need 133MB blocks with LN. [Source](
3. LN fees will go by supply and demand. Premiums could be paid to use channels with no restrictions. It will be profitable for many people to run anonymous businesses to operate channels blacklist free since they can generate fees. These businesses will have competition and drive fees down.
4. LN itself by moving tx's to sidechannel will reduce blockchain bloat and bring fees down. The only time micropayment channel tx's have to hit the network are if there is a problem or dispute, otherwise there would be no reason to use the blockchain. This reduces on chain tx's, reducing overall fees.
5. LN should make bitcoin *more* affordable by reducing on chain tx's, thus reducing tx's miners have to process, thus reducing tx fees. Other protocols that have been developed on existing technology will not be affected by what others do with micropayment channels, they can stick with what they are dong (although they might find a cheaper way to do it with LN).

People are against block size because of technical implications that would result from its implementation currently. No one is against fixing tx malleability because it would be a soft-fork that objectively protects the network. If one cannot comprehend the arguments against increasing the block size currently, then maybe they do not have a qualified opinion. Even devs in favor increasing block size at least acknowledge potential fallouts that may result. Being against something that would create a hard fork in bitcoin for a short term fix for a problem that has other possible solutions and being against something that strengthens bitcoin's protocol on a technical level that needs to be solved are not comparable. 
We know block size increase can provide relief but we also know it is not practical to keep increasing block size to meet demand without other changes. Fixing tx malleability is one of those changes that doesn't have the side effect of even *potentially* reducing decentralization, whereas a block size increase does. 
Both need to be done in the long term. If we fix tx malleability, micropayment channels will flourish, the blockchain will have some mild relief until bandwidth catches up to reduce the centralization risks of increasing block size. Things are not as simple as "raise block size, then network scales." If we raise the block size before global bandwidth can handle it, there may be some centralization implications down the road.
When we look back in 2017 would we rather say 2015 was a really slow year, or this network is all based out of data centers located on government and corporate property. I think most would prefer a slow year in 2015 than a more centralized network after reflection. This is why a block size increase right now isn't "the obvious choice." 
However, we can have our cake and eat it too. We just have to do lots of work (fixing tx malleability and developing micropayment channels) and avoid short-sighted hotfixes like increasing blocksize until we can manage it in a decentralized fashion and the network will be exactly where we want it in 2017.

This is what I was looking for- a concrete nondevisive noncentralizing proposal to aid scalability. Will do some more research on BIP65. In the mean time have a beer, @_date: 2015-06-01 07:23:24

It only matters for full nodes, not personal wallets. The only way this impacts your holdings is if half the nodes miners use switch to xt and the other half stay on qt you would get a fork. When you go to spend your UTXO's they would be treated differently based on the rules of the node clients that miners use. One network would propogate using qt rules, the other would propogate using xt rules. The result would be you would have coins on two different chains, one secured by miners running qt, the other secured by miners running xt. Only one of those networks will likely end up with value, as the smaller network can easily be attacked by the larger network.

Exactly. The idea is it improve stability (tx malleability needs to be fixed no matter what), while minimizing risk (no hard fork required and you won't find anyone arguing against the idea that tx malleability needs fixing) and increasing scalabiltiy potential (by allowing many smaller transactions to take place without touching the blockchain via micropayment channels).

Transaction malleability allows signatures to be invalidated by mutating tx's (thus invalidating refund and commitment tx's in the micropayment model). If signatures can be invalidated people can game the network to steal coins. Simply knowing about the problem does not prevent the attacks from happening on implemented micropayment channels.

1. True, but it could be implemented before the winter 2016 predictions of blocks being full.
2. Where is the proof of this? If the majority of tx's are happening on payment channels and only hit the blockchain if there is a dispute or parties wish to leave the channel, 1mb should be sufficient until global bandwidth is such that not only regulatory regimes are able to provide that level of bandwidth.
3. Yes but they will be significantly lower than blockchain fees, otherwise people will use the blockchain or be fine paying the fee for a timely tx (which would be less than sending every single tx through 20mb blocks).
4. Why would nodes not be able to issue tx's? Blockchain tx's would work the same as they do now. With lightning networks you can engage in a payment channel and at any time the tx's can be moved to the blockchain, validated by nodes (by either party- there is no central control in these side channels). Centralization will be less because people can choose to engage in these payment channels and cryptographically have the option to take their money and go home or to another channel, even if the channel is acting malicious. You still have the options as per the contract to redeem funds to the blockchain regardless of the payment channels support. This model offers much less centralization than moving all nodes to data centers in countries that have high bandwidth available (usually regulatory regimes).
5. What is your argument for this? How does lightning network fundamentally change bitcoin from the way it is now to prevent those features?
