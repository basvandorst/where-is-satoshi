Isn't that true for crypto though? That it's not protected by the same laws as the stock market?

Right now there is still no one crypto currency that is robust though for the job but there are ones better suited to the task. Etherium is a good example of a more robust currency while Doge coin is known to be extremely weak when compared to btc. The basic is this: btc was never designed with actual currency replacement in mind. It has nothing about it that makes it intrinsically more useful than, say, etherium and therefore is vulnerable to disenchantment until society on the whole recognizes it as a mainstream currency. Of course, by that time, you don't invest in it any more than you invest in the Franc.
Once we perfect the currency though and release "unicoin" or whatever we'd call it, btc and all others will collapse without warning

Broad adoption would destroy BTC. That's why most people are tentative to mess with it: there is a critical mass where BTC will completely crash when everyone realizes that it never was optimized to be used as a mainstream currency and is therefore worthless when compared to other cryptocurrencies.
This "Hold, hold, hold." Shenanigan is a bubble, and it will pop. You say it won't pop, you claim it won't pop, you say it's never not come back from popping before: I say that it will, eventually, pop. When it does, it'll all be gone. Could be tomorrow, could be in ten years, but if you don't some day sell, it will pop on YOU.
Invest only what you can afford to have turn into sand because eventually, it will be. Your hope is that you'll turn your gold into sand before that. Of course, you're competing with billionaires that are manipulating the market not only mathematically, but socially, though carefully timed news exposures and forums such as Have fun. Good luck. Be prudent.
