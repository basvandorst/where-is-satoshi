I am not that young �� but seems that a lot of businesses would want to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment and they would need help and advice on how to set up a wallet and an exchange etc., so perhaps there is an opportunity there.

I was not saying that you look after them. I am saying that if you have given them advice as to how to secure them and they get stolen - would you be liable?

But the issue I guess is this: if you set a business up to accept bitcoin and their bitcoin gets hacked or stolen, will you be liable for this?

Thing is, the idea is not to advise businesses on how to invest in Bitcoin - just give them advice on how to set themselves up to accept it as a form of payment for their business. Here in Marbella for instance, there is a nightclub that is offering you to pay in Bitcoin for events they hold, and a real estate company that allows you to pay in Bitcoin for property! So many businesses would want to accept payment but have no idea how to go about it. If you were only advising them on how to set up a wallet and an exchange and how to be secure etc, would that be a possible business opportunity that would not fall foul of financial laws?

This is why there is surely a business opportunity here! Most businesses can't even set up and manage their social media accounts so how are they going to deal with accepting bitcoin for their business? So like social media consultants, crypto consultants will manage and set up bitcoin accounts for businesses who want to accept bitcoin. No?
