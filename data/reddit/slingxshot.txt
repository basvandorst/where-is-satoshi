I am seeing a lot of panic selling. I am just removed all my emotions, and have to think logic logic logic logic, even thought I am loosing money
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:33
oh i clicked Deposit on GDAX from Bank Account, does that lock in? If yes, how does that work. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:50
why is coinbase/gdax crashing again? These guys take tons of $$$ fee, like crazy amount, they are probably making a million dollars every minute with just fees alone and can't have a site running smoothly?

I hope this is not the death of Bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:01:32
there is logic to keep this thing long term if you believe BTC might one day replace all traditional currencies
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:50:11
On GDAX is STOP SELL the only way to Sell when the price drops. Can I do the samething with STOP LIMIT SELL? 
Please help. Thank You

what's important is not to panic sell. I will hold even its going all the way down to 10K
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:23:54
I think the general rule is 1% of your income. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:51:02
No... 19K might be the new low in a month or two... patience
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:30:52
so this is how I see it.
buy it now and pray it goes up...
see if dips .. then buy it
I think more logical is too wait...if I miss something special then too bad
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:37:28
coinbase just crashed. I think something is going on here, so I charged my CC, since I can't wait a week for bank transfer, i'll miss on some considerable $$$ in one week...

The guys, need help here with GDAX. So I know how to sell at a price when it goes low, for example, bitcoin goes from 15,000 to 10,000, I set up SELL STOP. However, what if I want to do the other way, sell at 19,000 for example, is that the same process? 
Also what if I want to buy at a low price automatically, how do I set that up? Thank You!

I am here for the long run, I made a mistake keeping STOP SELL price so high, if it wasn't for the fees, I wouldn't care. I am going to place it safe, and just have a higher range on STOP SELL.

These future exchanges seem to be stabilizing it by a lot, this morning the movement of this currency barely moves 100 dollars. I do like it better that way, this will make feel better to HOLD, with large swings with buying low and selling is too stressful. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:05
My philosophy is dont sell under what you bought for....there are two ways it go...it will come back shorty.... hours to days... or it crashes and takes months to recover...
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:42:33
can i get few examples?
Thank You
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:55
they should put ads on gdax or coinbase.com, they can prob beat out google in one day, im kidding, but its crazy
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:36:33
So it seems I can't do both, SELL at lets say 10,000 or may be 19,000 I have to choose and decide if to take the risk?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:55:04
I think less than 5,000$ is not worth putting into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:09
Yep, I made that mistake several times first week of owning bitcoin. I am totally relaxed right now, I already know how this market works, eventually it will go up, it might take a week or a month, but it will eventually return. The only way bitcoin will stay down if crypto currency becomes dead... which its too early for that... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:06:21
Take advantage of Trump presidency? Republicans will most likely stay away from regulating bitcoin. People will make tons of $$ short term, long term, suffer? There will be lots of winners and lots of big losers. It is risky, I am for it and not for it. Is it possible to have 2 positions? :-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:57:29
I don't understand the difference between coinbase and XBT....  why is now about 1000$ difference?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:24
I'm actually watching this like a hawk, I just feel like this s$$$ might just blow back below 10K any moment now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:53:49
looks like everyone is so crazy about BTC right now that everyone is forgetting about LTC and the others. I noticed it wasn't moving much, sold everything into BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:14
So as a new bitcoin owner I am seeing a different perspective why this is going up. So few days ago bitcoin went full mainstream, not because people care what is represents or what is is, where just realized they could make tons of $$. So you insane amount of people registering and dumping $$ into bitcoin, and they don't know what bitcoin is... my feeling is this bubble won't be coming soon, I feel this thing will go to 40K to 100K before it bursts. Also at the same time I feel people will keep throwing money at bitcoin until you can't throw anymore into it... so if its 1,000,000 then that's where it might end up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:51
even at 10K it is still expensive, i own some bitcoin, just for security, but i am into altcoins right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:30
technically the exchanges have to match the other exchanges even if its down?
