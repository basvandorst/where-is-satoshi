It is and it isn't I'd say. Why do you feel it's useless for real world use? That's an interesting discussion to be had.

That's always been the risk. The largest draw of bitcoin however is it's indie spirit. Big governement released auroracoin and spaincoin. Their value is decent, but Bitcoin is still higher. 
Society is demanding an economy that is not regulated by the Governments, so coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin etc will remain firmly on top.

I'm a supporter of cryptocurrency as a whole. I'm here because I care about Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs more positive mainstream news and the Bitcoin community needs to create it. Did you read the article?

I think with the recent Mt. Gox incidents, combined with other negative happenings, such as Silk Road, the money laundering etc.  have given Bitcoin a very negative image in the public's eye. The problem I see is that not a lot of positive press has been happening that can be easily digested by the public.

I think that Bitcoin may eventually move to a price similar to it's competition, but it won't happen this year, or for many years to come. When the coin limit is reached, it's value will go way up.

I'm trying to say that there is a nonstop flow of negativity and that we as a community aren't doing nearly enough to stop it. It feels like there is an attitude that Bitcoin is awesome and that it doesn't require defending.
This attitude is the same as it's been for years and it needs to change.

For the buyer, it's instant, for the merchant, the money takes time for them to get it. Most businesses also have to keep special accounts for bad credit transactions and chargebacks. Credit cards are good enough for buyers, but very bad for merchants.

You're saying that it's silly to support doge? Crypto is crypto. Bad press for one hurts them all. The mention of doge has more to do with their positive community. So far both replies here are negative, seems like it just continues the trend doesn't it?
Zoopz, instead of just saying 'Silly doge supporter' why not offer something constructive instead of perpetuating the negativity?
