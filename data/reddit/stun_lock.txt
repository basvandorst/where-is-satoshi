Not today. In 5 years time 2.1BTC will likely be enough for a middle income lifestyle to retire on.

Things are not as they are reporting.
You do realise that its the same bank which has no issues processing non-USD withdrawals but has issues with doing USD withdrawals?
Also volumes in the past month are way lower than they were in March-April so the excuse of the bank not being able to cope with much lower volume is BS to me.

I find it amusing that people bitch about low liquidity when they themselves are using other exchanges and contributing to the lack of liquidity.

1) The Bitcoin production rate will halve every 4 years until it approaches 0 sometime in 2140. There will never be more than 21 million coins. In practice the number of usable coins might be quite abit lower due to people losing their coins.
2) Nothing stops the government from regulating Bitcoin, but enforcing the regulation may be impossible.

Well if you are already in the Hitler Club (2.1BTC saved up), you already have enough for retirement in the near future. 
Some people are content to have enough to retire on.

Why are you blaming the exchange for the lack of interest amongst Singaporeans? If anything, you should be irritated with people in Singapore for ignoring Bitcoin even though they have a local exchange which no country in the region even has the fortune of having.

My my, just look at all the jealous trolls here who cannot accept someone profiting from his own investment decisions.

Wow thats a big tip, thanks a bunch

On a more serious note, i agree with OP that people should be hoarding more coins while they still can.
Eventually the current elite and bankers will realise Bitcoin's true potential and that fighting it is futile and will start buying coins. We want to make this as painful for them as possible.

**The Singapore Dollar has lost 75% of it's value** since 2000, the identifiable party(MAS) is not refunding any value either, and neither do holders of the dollar have any recourse.

I don't buy the argument.
They are listed on bitcoincharts, the only SGD exchange atm mind you.
A google search with Bitcoin and Singapore brings up the exchange as the top hit and several announcement/discussion threads on BTTalk.
Couple of reddit threads talking about it as well.
I think most Singaporeans are either unaware of Bitcoins or do not have the intellectual capability to see its use. Look at MtGoxSGD, its dropped out of the listings, no trades for 5 weeks! Look at FYBSG, the volumes show the total lack of interest in Bitcoins locally.
We have 0 known businesses accepting Bitcoins locally. 
I pity the local exchange owners, they would have had much better success launching in almost any other country.
