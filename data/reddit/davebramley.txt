Good on you man!
I think its a great idea to invest the winnings you got on bitcoin speculation. I'm thinking about doing the same, but I cashed out a little earlier at $15,000. I definately dont think its a good idea to continue to gamble on bitcoin with all that money you've won... I know a lot of people who have made about $10,000 from a $1000 bet on bitcoin, who cashed out 9000 recently because its kinda crazy to continue to bet 10,000 lol
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:25:00
Holy shit you really do have thinking problems don't you? Please tell me you're trolling
@_date: 2018-09-23 11:13:55
No because i'm talking about bitcoin, idiot
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:42:17
L1 can scale, because 10mb blocks in a few years do not pose an existential threat to bitcoin and it's centralisation. 10 MB blocks would allow for much easier mempool clearance, and therefore LOWER fees. I'm NOT SAYING they will be 1 cent, they may still be $10 (i have no idea how much), but I DO know they will be LOWER than they would be if the block size is kept at 1MB.
Andreas has a weird black and white view on this issue. I ask you: why dont we lower the block size to 100KB? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:49:35
why are you choosing 200 day?

Stop talking about alt coins in @_date: 2018-09-23 11:15:26
Blocksizes are nearly full again. Is high fees a good thing? We cant open a lightning channel or send bitcoins to cold storage etc if the fees are too high, because it becomes impractical and unusable for normal people
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:34:50
Can you just read your comment back to yourself and understand why I'm having difficulty knowing what you just tried to say?
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:37:13
I think you have brain problems.
The charts show two completely different sets of data. One shows the mempool, the other shows the block size. A trend line can be drawn through my chart to show an UPWARD TREND towards full blocks. Ie full blocks in the future are inevitable. THEN the mempool begins to increase once blocks are full. and thus so do the fees (exponentially).
If you're still having difficulty understanding then theres nothing I can do to fix your dodgy brain.

100 $4 transactions raises the same block subsidary as 200 $2 transactions
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:05:19
It hasnt, its just made transactions take less room, and put the rest of the information outside of the block meaning that additional information isnt verified on chain
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:42:00
No that was not the issue. Did you read the question of my thread? It says "Will blocksize ever be increased". I never said "Will we ever fully scale layer 1 to account for every transaction ever". I already have my answer for that question. To put words in my mouth like that just damages your credibility. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:52:45
L2 scaling solutions are a better idea than purely L1 scaling. Scaling 100% on L1 could lead to various problems. Now go back to the start of this thread and re-read it all, and realise what an impertinent fucking moron you really are.
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:02:54
If fees are hitting $30 I think its pretty necessary. Even if a small increase brings them down to $10 theres no reason why it shouldnt happen. No ones going to clog the network with microtransactions if therye $10 each anyway, but I dont want to spend an unlimited amount of money every time i move some bitcoins out of cold storage.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:35:34
christ you are a moron. i didnt say fees are $30 today, but eventually they will be again. oh but sorry, you probably cant get your thick skull around that because you went to school in a tin box in a classroom full of vegetables being lead by a mouldy sea cucumber. or at least it fucking seems like you did
"USE LITECOIN BRO!!1!!" yeah yeah yeah, let me just crank up binance and ill switch some over, just gonna make a quick L1 transaction from my wallet itll be over in a jiffy
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:04:28
No it is not. You can be your own bank without running a node, because your coins are always held on the blockchain. As long as you keep your private keys safe, you ARE your own bank.
There is no incentive for non-miners to run a node. There is no advantage of any sort over using an SPV wallet. You're also not helping the network because A- You aren't contributing to hash power security, and B- you don't have any voting power.
If every single non-mining node rejected a block, the REAL mining nodes, would not care. They would continue their blockchain which will have the longest chain of signatures and most proof of work.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:39:45
Thanks that made much more sense. I agree with you, but yes I'm talking long term, because I always envisioned bitcoin surviving indefinitely 
@_date: 2018-09-23 11:59:33
I get what hes saying about petabyte blocks and moving shit transactions off chain, but does that mean we have to stick with the arbitrary 1mb? Opening L2 payment channels requires L1 transactions. Moving bitcoins to and out of cold storage requires L1 transations. With such a small block size it sounds as if only the privileged elite are going to be able to even afford to ever make an L1 transaction. Even if the blocks were still full after doubling block sizes, it would allow double the amount of people to get their transactions sent every 10 minutes, meaning fees would be exponentially lower as the rate the mempool clears would be doubled.
He may think mempools are good for that reason, and he has a point, but an ever growing mempool where there are transactions which can literally never be cleared, and exponential fee increases can surely never be a good thing.
I get what hes saying with the fee market to encourage people to make shit transactions on L2, but it gets to a point where the fee market is an even bigger problem than centralisation because literally no one can open a payment channel. In theory fees are unlimited so could reach thousands of dollars with enough network traffic. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:08:05
You're looking at the wrong graph. Obviously theres no mempool because blocks aren't full yet. How about looking at a chart that shows [h o w   f u l l   t h e   b l o c k s   a r e](
Also 9 months isnt a very long time unless you have a piss poor attention span, im thinking long term
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:32:34
when theres more transactions being broadcasted than can fit in a 1mb block ...... -\_-
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:31:00
How much bandwidth does a Lightning Node use?
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:00:21
What exactly do you mean? I'm getting the impression you think you do not control your own wallet unless you run a full node, which is incorrect. 
If thats not what you're saying then could you re phrase?
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:31:17
Now point to me in what way that shitty little comment was relevant to this discussion in any way what so ever?
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:37:05
Wrong again, igadjeed! If you cared to read this thread you will have noticed I am in favour of larger blocks but not unlimited block size. Does that sounds like a binary solution to you? Probably, because you have thinking problems! 
@_date: 2018-09-24 10:59:45

Miners should be the ones competing for blocks, not the users. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:46:14
get off my thread you impetuous little man. I want to have a real conversation about bitcoin, i dont want to play silly little games with pathetic people like yourself

I didnt start the fire
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:44:45
spot on, thats exactly my point. I'm worried a lot of people are 1MB purists who never want an increase ever, and to me just seems absolutely ridiculous 
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:38:38
now this is art.
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:50:04
Did you set out to make yourself look like an idiot when you wrote this comment? Because it looks like you did.
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:06:43
when are the talks?
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:02:55
im thinking about it
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:36:43
I still think that big blocks are better, but I just presume that I am wrong. 
Besides, if it ever turns out that I am actually correct, then BTC blocksize will be raised anyway, but that wont happen because I'm definitely wrong. Market decided.
@_date: 2019-03-24 10:51:14
Thanks for the good reply.
My main concern though is that we can currently process ~200M on chain transactions per year, maximum (that might be way off, but still).
If everyone in the world was going to be opening and closing LN channels more than once per month, that is surely never going to work with the current block capacity.
You finish by saying "It might be so that the fees for a real Bitcoin-transaction are only viable for larger amounts in the future.". That we can all accept but in your opinion, how large is too large? I think bitcoin L1 transactions still always need to be viable for the average person to make, otherwise that raises concerns over centralisation in itself, as people need control over their own finances and to set up their own LN channels (im not talking about coffee payments on L1, but I wouldn't really want my salary paid on LN)
@_date: 2019-03-31 16:02:34
That sounds really interesting. What is the strategic advantage of being a strong forwarding node? 
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:07:06
Well no miner is going to do that and even if there is the odd one who does, it wouldn't be nearly enough.
And why would waiting 1-2 days make a difference? New transactions with higher fees will still be processed ahead of old low fee ones
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:10:08
I wish there was an Internet wide mute button for people like you ��
@_date: 2019-03-30 10:24:00
How can LN work for merchants?
Forgive me if I'm mislead, but if LN is an abacus then merchants can surely never earn more money than they've put into channels in the first place?
Like, I couldnt just open a low funded channel and start selling stuff and receiving loadsamoney in LN payments, or am i wrong?
Disprove me and i'll go all in
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:59:06
How will people open LN channels then?
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:38:35
Since you're a pretty technical kind of guy, what is your opinion on the block size bottlenecking the lightning network (due to needing to make an L1 transaction to open an LN channel).
Is it a fallacy? I would absolutely love an explanation
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:24:37
what can be done to help small miners and decrease centralisation? its still becoming harder and harder to be a small miner despite the efforts made by LN and keeping the 1mb block size.
If you cant be a small miner, whats even the point of all this
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:55:03

Scammers keep trying to get people to "trade crypto" which is a scam to take people's bitcoin off them.
Stay vigilant. Never send your BTC to an exchange, and never spend your BTC on "alternative crypto currencies"
Remember: Everyone wants your bitcoin. Be strong and say NO.

I will never be able to set up a small solar bitcoin farm in the future when I have my own house, why live
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:35:22
If it requires a massive initial investment to be a miner, then surely they will consider the local broadband infrastructure when choosing a location, just as they would consider energy prices. So why would a 10gb block be of any issue?
I want to mine bitcoin on some old second hand solar panels i got from some old caravans. It's free energy i may as well put it to use, but i can never hope to actually mine a single satoshi. even if i join a mining pool, on chain fees will surely mean i wont even be able to get the fractional reward sent to me so i cant be a small miner even if i wanted to.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:14:21
ugh cringe
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:32:26
Would a small block partition for small fee transactions be a good idea?
So for instance when theres $1000 fees, there could be a small space in the block for some low fee (like $10) txs that cant afford $1000. Obviously it would take a LONG time for those to be confirmed, but now at least they can be assured that they will EVENTUALLY be confirmed rather than sitting in the mempool literally forever.
Yes I just said $10 is low fee for layer 1, because I think it is when people are using LN for free anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-07 09:31:26
spot on, btckoning
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:09:59
But thats not needed, because full blocks already create a working fee market where people are willing to pay as much as they think their transaction is worth.
But the problem I am addressing is if there are so many transactions in the mempool (for instance to open a LN channel)
forget it ive just realised why it doesnt matter
