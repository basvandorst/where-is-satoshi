Are you using bitkee?
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:17:33
I use Mycelium as a hot wallet with a small to medium amount of btc. For savings I use Armory with offline transaction signing. 
You might also want to look into paper wallet if you just want to store. Make sure you read how to properly create paper wallets though.
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:39:58
why the urgency?
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:57:17
I like intuitive backups and the ability to generate paper backups. I also like HD wallets
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:02:32
Is this also the case in blockchain.info My Wallet since is reuses the same address? Is the public key exposed in the same way?
Would reusing a bip38 paper wallet then be no less secure than blockchain.Info's wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:37:18

If you wish to spend bitcoin to make amazon purchases, i think its great. If you wan't to buy BTC by making amazon purchases, it _can_ be a smooth,  easy transaction without problems. I usually buy bitcoin from coinbase, but I had some amazon gift cards I wanted to convert to BTC and purse was ideal for that. I'd recommend Purse, just with the warning that if you do have to open a dispute, Purse support staff might not be helpful. 
edit: purse support contacted me, everything has been resolved. Purse was very helpful. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:22:34
yes, and what do you mean by "quotes"?
edit: It appears under the market tab that BI provides market quotes. I had no idea they offered this service. Which raises two questions:
1) Why would you use BI to get exchange prices?
2) Of the reasons to use or not use BI as a web wallet, why would their market tab issue be the deciding factor?

Yes. My comment was in reference to you saying "Electrum." in answer to a question about a cold storage solution for Mac. My point is that electrum without the trezor, and on an internet enabled device is not  cold storage. I didn't want the guy above you to misunderstand.

1. no, i don't use mail.com, i use gmail/protonmail
2. i use 2FA gmail via the google authenticator
3. I DO use authy on coinbase. I dont keep coins on coinbase, but I understand many people do. 
I'm sorry for what you've been through man, I really am. I am grateful that you decided to share it with the community, because it highlights security holes that werent as visible before. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 22:41:47
Personal experience. I accidentally stumbled upon a way to view the addresses of everyone I was purchasing for. To be fair, its not an issue with Purse.io, but with Amazon. I contacted Purse so that they'd be aware, but theres little they can do aside from waiting for Amazon to correct the issue on their end.  That being said, Purse can't protect your address if amazon is leaking it.

Trezor allows multiple wallets with the same seed but different passphrase for plausible deniability. They can only steal from the dummy account you shown them

"Why I as a Merchant I simply can't recommend BTC to my customers" is not the same as "Why I as a Merchant I simply can't recommend payments made from Circle Wallets to my customers"

Under normal operation it is hidden, so its not really in plain view. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:38:39
right, but remember people are looking for storage solutions not just for current value but expected future value as well. Ideally, it'd be nice to have a cold storage solution that didn't have to change depending on the value increase of the held BTC. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:25:19
Correct. The conversation should have ended here.
If you have BTC in circle you don't own BTC, you own an IOU from Circle for the equivalent BTC.

@_date: 2015-03-12 06:02:11
Edit. I misunderstood your situation. Bitcoin coin is an online wallet so  not sure what you mean. You don't trust a wallet that doesnt download the full blockchain and instead uses SPV?
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:32:14
Yeeeeah I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you on that one.

Suppose I did have $30000 in a single wallet. I do minimize fraud risk because I don't distribute my account credentials or sensitive information to every merchant I interact with. 
I am new to bitcoin. I am not trying to be argumentative, but I believe the push vs pull of financial transactions provides better consumer protection with bitcoin, so if I am incorrect I would like to understanding why.

3. Wasn't using authy
4. Kept ALL his bitcoins online, did not hold any of his private keys offline

@_date: 2015-03-04 13:45:08
Stop straw manning, no one said there is a free lunch. I feel safer with bitcoin because I control my money, no one else. Is the bitcoin infrastructure complete? Are bitcoin services competitive with credit lending services? Of course not. But the bitcoin protocol offers more power and  protection than legacy systems, and the infrastructure is being developed.

The world reserve currency is the US Dollar, not gold. Even when the US was on the gold standard, we did not process all transactions by exchanging physical gold, so I'm unsure why you're pondering the transaction limit of hypothetically exchanging physical gold as any sort of comparison. Right now, transaction velocity of bitcoin is still orders of magnitude lower than transaction velocity of fiat currency or paper money backed by gold.

@_date: 2015-03-04 14:22:46
I don't pay high fees with bitcoin, quite the contrary. I don't experience fraud, charge backs, account freezes, or third party transaction processors dictating to whom I can interact with. I can simulate with smart contracts properties of legacy systems, but I cant simulate trust less transactions with legacy systems. If you don't see any advantages the bitcoin protocol affords, I won't convince you otherwise.
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:20:51
Are you saying that with old coins and lots of dust with no tx fee, its possible the tx could NEVER get picked up?

Just curious, but why open yourself up to rely on trusting coinbase? There are a number of solutions to secure your bitcoin and retain private keys: hardware wallet, offline computer, paper wallets, multisig,...
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:36:10
I've made a few transactions on it. If the other party cooperates, everything is smooth. Unfortunately I've had the other party be unresponsive, provide the wrong shipping address, claim delivery never occured, etc... Multiple times I tried to open a support ticket and initiate a dispute with no response from Purse.io. It's like there is no one at Purse.io and they instead rely only on their automated systems running smoothly. If theres a dispute, good luck getting it resolved. I've yet to hear back from a human. 
I opened a dispute 5 days ago. Have not heard from Pursio.io support staff. 
edit: Purse resolved the dispute. Purse support was very helpful. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:13:43
Even if myTrezor.com was the only wallet with trezor support, You still have control of your bitcoin when myTrezor goes down because you still have your private keys

No, and there are very practical differences between custodial accounts and possession of private keys. See any exchange hack for instance

@_date: 2015-03-04 21:05:12
Agreed. This attack vector could have also initiated a wire transfer from his online checking or made fraudulent amazon purchases. My point is that his 2FA should have been better implemented, and barring that, he could have kept any number of bitcoins as safe as he wanted by not keeping them on exchanges or online wallets. Its not a secret that coins on exchanges are not perfectly secure. 
I'm okay sacrificing swap interest for security. 
I'm not sure what were arguing. I'm claiming he could have taken more steps to secure himself. Is it unfortunate these security holes exist? Of course. Is there a tradeoff between convenience/profit and security? Of course. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:22:58
What convenience do you lose by only storing .2 BTC on your phone than say 2 BTC. Are daily transactions above $50 common enough for you to trade security for convenenience?
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:59:44
Youre free to choose whichever wallet your prefer. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:28:58
I prefer mycelium. I would also suggest getting a cold storage solution for the 3 (and potentially more) BTC you do own
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:37:22
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:04:50
Do you view decentralization as a strength of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:47:30
So peace of mind in reference to few bugs/errors, if any? For my time I just find Armory to a better choice, because of multisig and offline transaction signing. Honestly I don't know if bitcoin core wallet offers the same functionality, I'll guess I'll look into it. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:34:58
I assure you it is still secure. I would bet that the problems the OP is experiencing is not a fault of a trezor. 
Edit: I mean not fault with leaked private keys
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:13:42
why would anyone use a wallet that requires additional transaction fees to go to the the developers? I understand it's a free product, but I have no problem donating. I do have a problem with charge-per-use.

PDF backup is only for imported single addresses. You can add more than one HD, and both HD account will be recoverable with 12 word seed.
 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:39:57
Can you outline the recovery process using my 2 private keys and xpub key of the 3rd in the event ninkip2p disappears?
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:04:39
Since the computers offline, unless youre worried about theft or physical access theres no need to destroy the computer =)
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:20:50
Youre not understanding. Of course blockchain shows the transaction from your address when they were stolen, it has to. He's saying that its more likely an app you installed other than mycelium gained access to your private keys. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:22:23
Not all copay wallets are multisig, in fact the standard one created when you create a wallet is not multisig.

Keys never leave trezor, regardless of the wallet you use. That is, unless you type the seed into a wallet

@_date: 2015-02-28 02:40:06
the last word in the seed is a checksum so it is unlikely he is typing it in wrong, as it wouldn't be a valid HD seed.  I think its more likely it has something to do with passphrase encryption if he had it enabled. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:17:44
you can just create a new wallet. If you want to delete the old one you just need to delete the wallet file, usually default_wallet, or wallet_1. The location of the wallet will depend on your operating system. but is usually stored in /.electrum/wallet/ 
You can also just make a new one without deleting the old one. Make backups. 
Don't delete a wallet file if it has coins in it and you dont have a backup.

@_date: 2015-02-28 04:28:02
yes please
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:52:38
You can also install electrum offline without ever doing an online boot, just transfer all the dependencies via USB 
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:10:35
Can't remember if you could in older versions. But in the recent Beta3 mycelium build you can generate single addresses. An old, offline android device running this could be used to generate paper wallets offline. You could also USB boot Linux from your Mac with network disabled. You can dowoad bitaddress.com for offline usage
Edit:  I'm also just a random guy on the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:16:37

hate what? its just a screen grab of a balance
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:00:47
You hace control until you don't, lol. That's not control. And were not talking about only theft here, as in today's scheduled maintenance by circle. You didn't "lose" control of your bitcoins for an hour. You never had control 
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:29:03
They are all backed up. The 12 word seed will regenerate all HD accounts you have under that seed
: the one that was created for you, and any additional HD accounts you added .
If you eventually restore from seed on a fresh mycelium install, and then choose add new HD account. It will restore the HD accounts in the order they were originally created, I believe. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:36:03
did you have passphrase encryption enabled before the firmware update?
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:07:28
edit: I'm curious the reason why my Mac wallet suggestion was downvoted. I'm actually interested in discussing the cons of the wallet. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:46:52
The theft would not be possible just using a gmail account with 2FA authenticater and a paper wallet

Ninki wallet 
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:21:53
True. I would only recommend ninki as a portable/desktop hot wallet. In which case my perceived risk in trusting the chrome app engine isn't high enough to forgo my perceived benefits in using Ninki. 
I like the convenience of Ninki in multisig, transaction limits, velocity limits, and wallet networks synced between mobile and desktop. As a small wallet for daily spending I'm not worried about it. 
As others have said, Electrum is probably your best bet. While I also use electrum when needed (it does have some nice features), it doesn't make sense for me to use as my main hot wallet. I am not a fan of hive. I do not want to use the Bitcoin-core wallet. I didn't like Multibit HD, and I didn't like the recovery format of Copay (which is also a chrome app). I prefered Ninki over all these. 
That being said, I would not recommend Ninki (or any of the above wallets) for any large storage of bitcoin.

yeeeah, i had to click "Pay with Card" to find the bitcoin option. Not really ideal
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:47:30
I don't get it either 
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:41:36
Yes, follow the advice above in jcoinners post
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:21:27
its still secure for practical purposes. Just not quantum secure or private.
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:23:37
OP, I also didnt like the recovery process of copay. Check out ninki wallet, multisig with easier recovery using standard tools.
Although with fewer features than copay. Ninki is good for single individual multisig, not multiple party wallets.

I'd say the biggest weakness is how new it is. I love this wallet for 4 reasons:
1. 2FA and Multisig in which I hold 2 of the 3 keys as mnemonic seeds. Makes recovery easy.
2. Transaction and Velocity limits. I can set a limit to the amount or frequency allowed me to spend from the wallet, which I can change anytime in the desktop app
3. Network feature. My friends can easily send and receive from each other without having to ask for or see QR codes/addresses.
4. I really like the UI
If you have any questions ask this guy @_date: 2015-03-18 11:41:37
Yes, that is correct 
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:25:57
What peace of mind do you get from using the bitcoin core wallet 
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:37:08
Why would you link to imgur and not the source?
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:07:00
Blockchain.info App. Just scan your paper public addresses. You can archive the MyWallet address that comes with it so you dont have to deal with it, and you can easily switch between BTC and local fiat. You can also set up email/sms/android notifications that will monitor all scanned addresses. No need to trust Blockchain.info since your private keys are never exposed, and you can take advantage of their great UI.

Youre a bitcoin early adopter and would never reccomend to a friend how that they manage their own keys?
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:43:00
Its a stable release. Desktop as a chrome app, android app, and I know they finished a stable release for iOS, just not sure if its been accepted yet.

When I tried to import my Trezor wallet into Electrum it asked for my trezor seed, and I'm assuming once I do that will also ask for my passphrase. Can you explain to my why entering my seed+passphrase on an online computer doesn't compromise my trezor? 
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:10:30
Armory and electrum both do offline signing of watch only HD imported wallets. Yes, you can view and send to public addresses on your online computer, and spend / sign / sweep using the private keys on your offline computer
Or buy a trezor 
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:32:19
can you try scanning your xpub keys in myTrezorLite or electrum? If it shows your coins, good you still have access to them and can see in which addresses they belond. If it doesn't show your coins AND doesn't also show previous transactions before the firmware update, then that would confirm the recovery process did not recover your old wallet (perhaps because is different passphrase). If it shows transactions before the firmware upgrade, and a large transaction you did not initiate, you can see where they went.

And now mycelium support

total over all acounts, and split totals for each type =)

I would also caution against using it if you're uncomfortable leaking your shipping address. While for the most part your shipping address is hidden via amazon through the gift wish list, its not secure and the buyer can in fact see your address.

Mycelium and CB aren't cold storage...

How long do you usually have wait before amazon status shows the item was delivered and the funds are released from escrow?
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:19:26
4 BTC!
@_date: 2015-02-06 05:01:18
Yes you can, let me know if its not working still and I can give instructions 
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:18:00
There has never been a reported case of leaked private keys with trezor
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:20:53
Look at their RNG implementation in their source? Or maybe someone knows offhand 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:40:03
I think there's value in curated reviews from people taking the time to respond to you, probably filters out the less reliable reviewers 
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:10:57
If you enter the password in wrong, it won't tell you its wrong, it will just create a new empty wallet using that password. So if there's any way youre entering your password in wrong, try to make sure it was exactly as it was before the firmware upgrade 
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:16:35
Dont do this online, download from github and run locally
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:41:22
its on audible.com. Not sure if you wanted a visual copy. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:31:57
In other words, if your coins were stolen then a transaction will definitely show them being sent from your mycelium generated address, but that does not necessarily mean mycelium initiated the transaction. It just means your private keys generated by mycelium were compromised, and it is more likely the case another app gained access to your private keys or your keys were compromised in some other way
 perhaps a backup you placed online. I trust mycelium. I dont trust other apps.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:40:22
fireproof safe and offsite backup (parents house, without the extra passphrase)
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:56:10
Not sure why you're being downvoted, while I dont agree with you, I think your opinion adds to the conversation 
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:25:45
Sounds more practical to me 
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:17:07
Multisig, slick android app, wallet network, this is really amazing. And everything is beautiful, you should be very proud of this
