And I'm here regretting that i sold my 0.5 when it was around 300$, and also my Stellar Lumens which are 50 times as much now... I mean I don't really care that much, there are endless opportunities ahead.
Sorry for your loss. And for the peope who are in the same position, keep chasing those opportunities. There are ICOs that sky rocket to 100 times in value in less than a month. Just gotta play it smart.

That's exactly why most of us are here mostly and there's nothing wrong with that. Pretending is worse.
Though, people think that crypto is so safe and banks are the devil. 
I can imagine a cyberpunk world where people would get tortured on a daily basis for their private keys, without any trace, people sending their crypto into the void for typing a character wrong and malware being so advanced, it would be in thin air. I can imagine crypto markets falling apart in mere seconds, blocks manipulated, everything falling apart because their encryption just wasn't enough.
Crypto and fiat have to coexist. One won't just replace the other.
Just because crypto skyrocketed from literal nothing to thousands of dollars value does not make it the best thing ever that should replace fiat and banks. Paper had no value too, but then they called it money.

There should be a rule that says you can't make a meme about the fact that you lose money and about how proud you are hodling all those fucking bags that get thinner everyday. Nobody cares.
Woah, 8th rollercoaster meme this week, wow like 20 other memes about the fact that your loss is temporary.
Also get out of here with that 1 btc=1 btc bullshit, you put food on the table using fiat, even if you're buying food with BTC, it's gonna scale with it's value in fiat.
Stop lying to youself
