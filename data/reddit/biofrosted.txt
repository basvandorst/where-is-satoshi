I have absolutely no idea of who the last two are 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:05:34
What’s the first? WHAT’S THE FIIIRSTT
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:48:45
I agree. Let’s make Boaty McBoatface 1st
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:02:39
Seems accurate 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:33
That’s my man. If you scroll down on my profile page you’ll see a physical dogecoin, copper made.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:48:01
Well, contact them again. I believe they are the only one that can do anything, unless if it’s a glitch. Contact the hell out of them till you get an answer
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:31:01
Why bitcoin when you can dogecoin
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:41:57
I bet you a bitcoin it won’t 
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:08:12
You mean other than Crypto?
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:47:27
Well I mean that I looked into it and read about it, but other people might understand it easily than you, so I came up here and asked. A second view is always good
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:49:12
It's very possible. But hey, as my Master told me, After every slope, no matter how big, there is an uphil.
Let's hope it for the Bitcoin or they are screwed... Now's probably a good time to invest in the Ripple �� 
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:06:59
appart from its mineability (sorry for probably invented word) it is in my opinion very alike to the Bitcoin and has a max supply of 100 billion, meaning transactions can be infinite. I trust this coin
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:04:55
It is Premined, although I am not sure about that 70% of supply, because them owning that much prevents the coin from shifting too much, but the coin is in a constant shift between 0.22€ and 0.17€, even though 5 cents is nothing for us, it represents close to 25% of it's worth, which is kind of a high change. Now again, if its developers own that much, they can slowly increase prices to 1-2€ and see if it gets buyed or not.
In my opinion, Ripple isn't buys because it's too cheap to have an influence, you would need to buy thousands to make some good profit. Riding the price will make the difference 
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:12:28
No worries 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:48:30
I searched but I want other people's point of view on it
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:56:26
Well, a good theory would be that people love Bitcoin, right? And if Bitcoin is going down, + some laws will be added on it in a close future (not sure which laws), the chances are that people want a Bitcoin-ish crypto, therefor, Ripple. Ripple is based on the same developing method as Bitcoin, in contrast of Etherium or Dash for example.
Also, Ripple is very low in cost meaning that if it rises (probably will) you don't loose anything, if it stays at the same price you don't loose anything, but it can't really decrease since it's cheap.
Btw, I hear rumors that Ripple might be the next coin on Coinbase, and I trust those rumors since the same people told me to buy Litecoin at a decent price, then immediately went up like crazy
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:12:08
Probably futuristic things, meant to happen in a (close) future (SpaceX for space travels, electric or hydrogen cars, maybe robots?)
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:57:33
No worries, glad to help ^^ 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:10:03
I'm sorry, who are you?
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:12:35
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:58:39
The thing is that Bitcoin rised so much that chances are it won't again. Plus, laws all around the world would be established soon, as I said. 
I don't really know what those laws are about, but it's a 50/50 situation:
People like the laws, Bitcoin rises
People hate them, bye bye Bitcoin and hello other coin, why not Ripple?

Thank you

Well, Ripple! �� there are not many new things with great potential, for one reason:
If You didn't hear about it, You don't know it's potential.
If you hear about it, it's probably already high up in the market and costs too much.
Apart from cheaper and known cryptos as Etherium classic, Ripple, Litecoin... You don't really have a choice. The right thing to do here: *read*.
Read a lot about people's changes in everything, taste, about the future and futuristic things. This is how people like Elon Musk and Warren Buffet went up: they read and they have a lot of knowledge.
Warren Buffet stated that he reads more or less 600 pages a day, this man has an extrordinary knowledge about everything, do the same, and you will find the right investment

Bank's stock market, maybe?

Investments are like going to Vegas, You don't really know what will happen and predicting it is nearly impossible, although you can somehow do it
