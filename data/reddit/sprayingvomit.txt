It's an extremely risky move with the rumour of 700k stolen bitcoins. 
Don't take investment advice from anyone on this subreddit, take the information instead and act upon it like how you want. 
Do not think you have to follow the crowd too, if everyone is buying/selling, does not mean you should too.

@_date: 2014-02-25 12:39:16
The Bitcoin community has learned that mtGox is nothing but horrible when it comes to any PR work. Don't expect fast updates or statements from them, and when it does come, expect it to be horrible 
Heck most exchanges released a statement already regarding mtGox, but they can't even release a statement about themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:02:40
To be fair, for the past year, mtGox has proved to be nothing but unreliable. Their failure as a company has been expected if they weren't going to change how they operate, and they didn't.

How about nothing is confirmed yet?

@_date: 2014-02-25 12:53:18


I think you answered your own question. People left their BTC with Gox instead of withdrawing into their own wallets when they had the chance.
*mtGox also stopped withdrawals, so people who wanted to withdraw, couldn't.*

You don't see Pepsi making announcements about some factory fuck up in Coca-Cola's company, even if they knew about it. 
Just like how mtGox fucked up, they're the ones that have to come clean, not other exchanges. Other exchanges are not responsible for informing the public about Gox and what they did.

If anyone was big enough to invest in Bitcoin growth, they would be more educated about the subject and know that Bitcoin's security or technology has nothing to do with mtGox's failure.

I seriously would not mind MtGox as a central bank. But the fact that they're ethics are shit is what makes me go against them. It's stupid how most of the people here are kissing up to MtGox. They did maintenance for hours and did not notify people on their website that it was taking place. They tweet about it hours later, after everyone panic sold. They were proud that their servers crashed/lag, while Bitcoin fell down 50%.

Are you new on this subreddit? Anyone who points out a valid, negative point regarding Bitcoins will be downvoted. Their statement will be burried away from everyone else. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:38:17
We can't deny the fact that as of this moment, BTC can only be obtained by exchanging USD or other currency. Until there's a different method, it will be all about money. The BTC prices revolve around USD. If you purchase things with BTC, you would know that. Merchants adjust their BTC prices based on the USD exchange rate. If the BTC/USD value goes down, merchants charge more BTC. 
Unless you're happy paying 4x the original amount of something, don't preach about money.

Actually, if anything, prices will increase on Monday since banks are closed during the weekend, so people won't be able to deposit their money to buy Bitcoin. If anything, it will fall during the weekend because there aren't as many buyers.

@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:16
At the same time, you have to realize that people will be afraid to accept Bitcoin if the value keeps jumping around like this. Take the person that sold their Porsche for 100BTC. He basically sold his car for $5000. 
If I was a merchant, I personally would not accept Bitcoin anytime soon knowing that their value is like this. You have to understand that merchants are also "investors," and they're losing because of this bubble burst also.

No, this is simply the reason why no exchanges accept Paypal or credit card payments. The cold fact is that people will chargeback knowing that they can get away with it.

You have to understand most merchants aren't fortunate enough to have that type of inventory and rely on a measly 10% profit off their sales. They cannot afford to take a fixed around of BTC with the rates falling constantly now.

Profit and the cause. But both reasons aren't there anymore. I've lost over 50% of what I invested. The cause isn't there anymore because the value has fallen so much. Think of the merchants that tried to support bitcoin, they're risking a lot and they ended up getting screwed over. Sure you get to pay anonymously and shit, but the merchants are getting screwed over.

There are people who ruined their lives because of this. They don't need to be told "Oh it's all your fault," which is all this subreddit has done. And frankly, they don't need these type of cruel jokes. Go troll somewhere else and learn when it's appropriate to do so.

tbh I'm a little discouraged because the price stopped increasing today. But judging from what I've been reading, it's only temporary

They have a daily EMT sending limit. Not sure when their cycle starts/restarts. I ran into it last night, but was able to withdraw $500 this morning. Didn't get the EMT transfer yet though.

The huge sell-off was yesterday when it hit around $60. Where do you see the sell-off? Looks like people are holding on to their coins right now.

Payments can be tracked down from origin if needed. Also, BTC isn't the first currency to be "anonymous." Look at LibertyReserve for one. It's the method of payment that's used for online blackmarkets such as buying stolen credit cards. There's also been a new market launched that ships guns parts by parts, which also takes LR as their main method of payment. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:14:06
It'll be hard to get merchants to accept Bitcoin when all the ones who did just got hit hard. Downvote me all you want for pointing this out, but it's the truth that cannot be avoided.

Currently trading at $105 at LibertyBit. Was $120 less than half an hour ago. I stopped relying on MtGox prices and anything that uses their API. You guys should too.

Doesn't it hurt knowing that you pay x amount in bitcoin, and then two weeks later, you realize that you paid 2x amount? ):
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:16:39
That's what I thought too, but at the rate it's going up, even if it crashes, if I sell it early enough, I would still make a profit. I bought it when it was at $120. Now it's at $220 for Canadians. By the end of this week, it'll probably be up $300, if by chance the market does crash, I'll be able to catch it before the value goes &lt;$120. I understand what you mean though, but it's better to invest earlier than never/later!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:40:59
Good on them for being educated about the subject, unlike all the other mainstream news sources.

Don't think it's a good idea for you at all bud.
@_date: 2013-07-04 04:53:02
With the volatility, I've come to realize it's best not to dump a shitload of money on Bitcoins, but instead, buy BTC when you plan to use it. The price hasn't gone up for months, it's been a straight line down. I don't think it'll go up anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:38:12
It's all negative attention though..
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:54:53
The difference is that they're not losing anything.

Greed. The idea of doubling my money in a matter of days was too hard to resist. My initial $1000 investment did almost double in a matter of days, but I chose to stay.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:51:45
hey, just wondering, do we get an email notification when libertybit has verified our payment? I keep checking back every hour or so to see if I got the money in. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:45
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it'll be going up to $200 anytime. Thinking optimistically, it will be stable around $100. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:11:41

If you're selling, sell it on LibertyBit. Their asking prices are higher.

I put in $1000 last week, made purchases of $150 and $260, averaging out to 5 coins for $200.
I currently have 6 coins from daytrading. But I'm still at a major loss of over $500 as of this moment (
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:44:16
I deposited last night and it went fine. Copied and pasted the address, didn't use the QR code. Confirmation took an hour though.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:22:03
Ok, here are the reasons why your reasoning is stupid.
1. Why the fuck would Bill Gates bother with this. He's out of the business and doesn't care less about money. He's donated over 90% of his wealth, I doubt he'd care about some measly virtual currency.
2. Shutting down the internet? What are you, an 80 year old politician that's uneducated about the internet? 
3. As of this moment, there are 11028900 bitcoins. At the current exchange rate, that is 1.2 billion dollars. Why would someone go through all this trouble and waste 1 billion dollars to ruin an idea that would not affect them at all. 
4. DDoSing the blockchain? The Bitcoin network is stronger than any super computer in existance, which makes Bitcoin special and what it is. Pretty much impossible to DDoS it unless you have a stronger network and power than it, which is highly unlikely. Also, learn the difference between DoS and DDos.
5. You refer to someone "rich" to Bill Gates? If you're going to wave around conspiracy theories, at least sound a little bit more professional so people would believe you. You should also learn about Bitcoin and know that if that were to happen, mining difficulty would increase, and then their mining capabilities would be useless after a short while. 
6. What government? It is possible, but Bitcoin is worldwide, it'll be hard to get all the countries to ban it.
I'm not saying Bitcoin is perfect in any sense. I've invested in Bitcoin and lost. I do think Bitcoin will fail at one point, but not for any of these reasons as they are unrealistic. Here's one reason why Bitcoin might fail.
- Bitcoin is known for being secure, and backed up by 776PetaFLOPS computer equivalent. It's pretty much impossible to "attack" or DDoS bitcoin or the chainblock. However, an exploit can be found regarding the chainblock, allowing hackers to control the flow of Bitcoins. This is still very unlikely, but one of the few possible scenarios that will completely kill Bitcoin. Bitcoin will no longer be secure as it was meant to be, no one will trust it to use it. Here is a very well written thread about more plausible scenarios. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:58:09
Prices will crash... again. Everyone will panic sell. Each person selling for cheaper than the previous.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:47
The prices at LibertyBit was $90 a few mins ago until some tard put some up for $70. I've noticed that LibertyBit and CAVirtex both are higher than BTC-e/MtGox. Nothing new.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:06:08
Good luck man!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:41:53
People have to shut up with this line. Unless you're a millionaire, anyone would be sad about losing a thousand.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:39:11
Weeks, months? Not until mtGox fixes their shit. I personally don't use MtGox, but the BTC market heavily relies on them.
But then again, I could be wrong, and it could go up to $100 this morning.
I'm only hoping for a higher price since I bought at a loss and would like to take off some of that loss.

Definitely not this subreddit. I'm sorry to hear about your situation, but all you're going to get here is "You shouldn't invest in more than you can afford."   
Most of us fucked up this week, you really don't need more people telling you did. Good luck!

But I was ~~shitting my pants~~ having so much fun ):
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:40:09
It depends on the reason why it crashed. There's a thread on reddit saying how BTC can fall to $0, which made perfect sense. If there was some exploit making BTC no longer a "secure" method like it was advertised to be, chances are, it won't go back up, even if the problem was fixed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:32:44

19 year old photographer. Dumped in $1500, took out $500 right before the crash.
With all my BTC together, I bought at an average of $200/BTC. If I were to sell now ($100 on LibertyBit), I would be out $500.

It'd be helpful if you give us your country. LibertyBit accepts EMT, takes about a day to receive your funds.

Yes because everyone calculates a 75% loss in 24 hours.

It hurts me to say this when I have put so much time and money into Bitcoins, the system is so flawed. This whole "this is the future" talk won't be realistic anytime soon. People have lost so much money to support a lost cause.

The prices won't be that affected. Mining difficulty will be increased, it'll help balance things out.

I did not listen to it, simply read your notes on Bitcoin scenario. Anyone who is educated in Bitcoins can easily argue back and say that those are unrealistic and would not work/happen.

No I didn't, I'll admit that. Maybe they should not title their podcast "Let's kill Bitcoin" and then list a bunch of unreasonable scenario.
Anyone who is educated about Bitcoin would not waste half an hour listening to what seems like an uneducated interview. However if their title was something like "Why bitcoin will live" or something, maybe that will generate more views and attention.

1) Highest liquidity because no one is willing to change that.
2) It really isn't the easiest to use, have you tried other exchanges yet? 
Also, "quite quick if it is working." That's like paying for 50mbps internet but only getting 20mbps half of the time. And then justifying it by saying it works great when it does. You're not getting the service you're promised.
3) API is lagging most of the time. Just because they provide an API, does not automatically make them the one that everyone has to use.
4) You can wait to get verified on another site before switching over. That's really no excuse.
5) Yes, that's true. But just because you head there first, does not mean you can't change.
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:18:32
I wouldn't exactly call that hidden since it's on their fees table. But either way, that $2.50 fee is pretty cheap. It's only .5% of $500.
