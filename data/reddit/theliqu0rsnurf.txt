"which we very carefully vet to avoid Shaun Bridges/Carl Mark Force scenarios"
Really....do ya now?
Explain to the class HOW you exactly do that?
Answer: You comply with ALL LE requests, and don't ask questions.
You know better than to defy a court order/LE request. Don't bullshit the Bitcoin community into otherwise.
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:03:24
My god that sounds like something a lawyer would write.
Verbose with the intention of obscuring the point the other party made, which is: You have ZERO *actual* ability to prevent a Mark Force/Shaun Bridges scenario...but I realize you can't freely admit this.
Force's subpoena of Mt Gox was *legititmate* on the surface. You can't prevent this.

Only morons lost on Gox. Sorry, but it's true.

When was the network in limbo again?
I've been using Bitcoin for 5-10 transaction a day, every day, in commerce for the past year.
Not a single transaction has been caught "in limbo".
You're a shill, an ETH pumper or just a goddamn monkey idiot.
@_date: 2016-03-30 09:31:59
Yeah, he kinda goes off on a weirdo tangent.
He's right, these issues exist.
The question isn't whether or not it's inevitable..it's whether or not these issues are *imminent*.

Well then you're bad at math..

I actually use Cash2VN quite a bit.
If you need cash into a bank account, it's great.
If you need cash in hand and have no VN bank account...I'm not sure they can help you yet.
I'm in Saigon. If your friend is in Saigon and needs cash...let me know.
(No, I'm not trying to scam. I will actually meet them in D1 or something before any coins change hands. I like meeting Bitcoiners.)

@_date: 2016-06-05 14:41:00
Hope they can explain to the VN Government where all that fiat is going..
VN has strict capital controls. Somebody is eventually going to want to know how you're rebuying coins with the fiat you receive if it's illegal to send money outside of VN without government approval.
In VN, this can get expensive. (bribery, corruption is RAMPANT here.)

"It's free money!"
Uhhh..only people like you would say this.
You think investing in BTC in 2011 was easy? Even if it was only a few hundred bucks, it was still RISK. He took that risk and was rewarded.
There was no "free".

You do realize that nearly all of these articles, positive and negative, are specifically designed to affect public sentiment, and therefore price?
Nobody divested. Nobody sold. They just made it look like they did to get a better deal, in some way.
Manipulation, my friend. If you think Bitcoin markets aren't seriously manipulated, you're crazy.
Not that it makes it any different than any other market in history.
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:04:16


No, they are not. Nobody is going to rob you in a Starbucks. Check the bills for validity, wait for one confirmation. Stop being a bitch.


You got this part right. Plus most of these tumblers are probably set up or monitored by LE to gain intel.


Wrong. 
Money laundering? That doesn't even make sense. Are the funds derived from illegal activity? Whether or not you use accurate identifying information when you purchase your coins makes no difference if the proceeds are from something illegal. You can give your real information all day long...and if the funds are derived from illegal activity, you're *still* laundering money.


It's only tax evasion if you don't report the tax. So pay any owed tax.
Who's being defrauded? A fraud requires a loss of value, or attempted loss of value. If I tell you my name is Mickey Mouse and you sell me coins, I haven't defrauded you. I may have deceived you, but I have not *defrauded* you.
**Buying Bitcoin with cash is fine...and quite frankly, worth the small premium you'll pay in price. You are being monitored regardless, whether you think it or not. Do you have ANY IDEA how many regular old Bitcoiners have been scrutinized by LE just by using Bitcoin, cash buying or exchange buying?**
**Answer: A fucking lot.**
@_date: 2016-06-06 06:16:32
It's both...you know-it-all.

BitGo wouldn't have that issue because you still control the private keys.
Blockchain.info...who knows. But who in their right mind uses them anymore?

Check your math.
About 7000 UNDERSTAND it, maybe 700,000 actively use it. Maybe 7 million have ever used it.

I think you mean off exchange...or over-the-counter.
"Off chain" doesn't make sense in this context.

We'll see what happens to Bitcoin after there's another Paris or San Bernadino where there is irrefutable evidence the attackers used Bitcoin in some way.
THEN we will have ourselves a war.
They will always use the most advantageous occurrence to promote their totalitarian agenda....as we are seeing with Apple/FBI right now.

Hell of a way to convince people there is no backdoor.

Dood, LocalBitcoins.
And before some jackass jumps up and says, "BUT HE'S NOT A MONEY TRANSMITTER!!!!!! IT'S ILLEGAL!!!"
That's not reality.
You can sell your personal coins for fiat all day long. You're not engaging in the selling of coins as a business, which is how the money transmission laws come into play.
If I go to European casino, win money, come back to the US and sell my Euros for Dollars to someone (assuming I declared any $10k+, or equivalent at customs)..I do *NOT* need to be registered as a money transmitter with FiNCEN.
It's the same process...except instead of Euros, you're selling your coins.
Wanna be 100% legit? Sell them locally and pay your taxes on any gain.
Coffee shops, lots of people, check the bills before you leave THOROUGHLY, never do over a few thousand at a time for personal security reasons.
Fuck Coinbase.
