**Between mining pools**. Uniqueness is guaranteed between pools because each pool naturally uses a different address to claim the block reward, so different pools are working on different sets of transactions.
**In the same pool**. When the getwork protocol is used, each miner receives its own unique piece of work. This is possible because the coinbase transaction (the one that distributes block reward) can contain arbitrary data so the pool makes sure that this data is different for each miner. This guarantees that workers in the same pool work on different inputs.

In the case of Mtgox their wallet produced an invalid transaction TX1 (which was rejected by miners). Apparently someone fixed their erroneous transaction to produce an equivalent transaction with different id TX2. 
The correct transaction (TX2) was successfully mined and included into the blockchain. However, MtGox wallet was only tracking the original transaction (TX1) so from its point of view this transaction was never confirmed and the funds never spent, while in reality they were spent by the TX2 transaction.

Let's clear a few misconceptions here. You seem to be under the impression that each block hashing attempt by miners involves a new randomly generated nonce, which is large enough so that different miners are unlikely to generate the same one.
This is incorrect. In theory it could work this way but for reasons of efficiency it doesn't: it's infeasible to generate billions of random numbers each second to feed to the miner. Thus, the miner works deterministically, setting the "nonce" value in the block header to 0 and incrementing it by 1 at each hashing attempt.

Discussed here: 
TL;DR: transaction chains like this are about 20-25% of the total transaction volume and this has been going since mid-2010. No one knows what they are.

I made a script that scans the blockchain adding all coinbase (ie. generation transaction) outputs to the total value and subtracting them as soon as they are spent.
At each point of the scan (ie. after each block) this value holds the total number of bitcoins that have never been spent after being created. To make the daily chart I just took values after the first block of each day.
Edit: here's the source code of the script: 
It is written in Scala and uses BitcoinJ library to do actual block parsing
Edit2: the code may be messy as it's a part of a program to calculate various blockchain-based metrics but I tried to extract all relevant code into a single file

This sounds about right (for comparison [here is similar findings]( from my script). 
I was talking about that media story which was widely published in late 2013 that 64% of coins have never moved at all after being mined.

It does use the same curve, however a Bitmessage address consists of two public keys (one for signing, another for encryption), which are hashed using SHA512+RIPEMD160
A non-p2sh Bitcoin address on the other hand is a single public key hashed with SHA256+RIPEMD160
Thus even if private keys are the same they will produce different addresses with no way to associate one with the other.
Edit: and for those who are curious, the hash cointained in the Bitcoin address is d0a9b94fb1af00b7f9c1d4030d0dca060546e4e1 and the Bitmessage address is 00ea69496dc0abf67320983d3e55ba4e0b89dee6

Bitmessage addresses are not related to Bitcoin addresses, so they cannot be "linked" in any way.
The only way for the guy to prove ownership of the Bitcoin address without moving funds is to sign a message with it.

Around 55% of those unspent coins belong to Satoshi (there was a bug in the early versions of bitcoin that allows to distinguish between early miners, and about 1,100,000 coins were mined by the same person who mined the first block)
The majority of the remaining unspent coins were mined in early 2010 before exchanges appeared. 
I believe those coins that ignored the move from zero to $1200 and back to $200 are likely lost.

The big question is what would be the incentive for sellers to accept Paypal instead of Bitcoin directly (and losing on the average 5% or so to fees and chargebacks.)
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:19:15
Interesting fact: Bitcoin was about $0.25 in December 2010, so Satoshi's estimated stash of 980K BTC was only worth $250K.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:06:25
Well, now it's $850 million...

Let's say proof-of-stake becomes so commonly accepted that the majority of Bitcoin users want to switch to a PoS cryptocurrency. In this case there is nothing stopping them from implementing PoS in Bitcoin proper. 
The same argument applies to many (most?) other changes that altcoins implement.

On the plus side, we will very soon see whether the price run to $1000 was a pure speculation on the possible future Bitcoin adoption in China. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:17:05
I believe that the everyday folks would use a combination of the following:
**Cold storage.** It is very easy to secure bitcoins for long-term storage using a paper wallet. You can generate paper wallet addresses on a computer that is never connected to the internet making it 100% secure against hackers. 
**Online wallet with two-factor auth** for convenient everyday spending. 
More advanced users would use a dedicated device (such as a netbook with offline Armory client or a hardware wallet)
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:46:41
In January bitcoin was $15, no wealthy investors were interested in it, no one considered China as a source of growth and, naturally, no one (except hardcore believers) expected it to go to $1000 by the end of the year. At that time you couldn't invest even $1 million in bitcoin without sending the price 100% up. 
I doubt that your friend's "discussion" really happened.

Buying back is the hard part. There are many bitter people on bitcointalk who sold at $15 or $10 after the 2011 bubble but then never bought back because they were waiting for $1. They still lost compared to those who bought at $30 and held. 
That said, if you can precommit to a stop loss (e.g. buyback at $1200 no matter what) then why not. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:07:14


Nope. You absolutely *can* change the code to use SHA3, scrypt or whatever and continue the existing blockchain. It will require a hard fork of course but it will be unanimously accepted if SHA-256 proves to be insecure.

It's the opposite in the case of Paypal. You're paying Paypal fees to make sure *your customer* can get their money back from you.

**Network security argument**. Bitcoin offers the most secure blockchain by far because of tens (maybe hundreds already) of millions dollars invested into ASIC miners. If the world switches to a non-SHA256 currency, all this security infrastructure is lost and needs to be recreated from scratch.
**First mover advantage argument**. Case in point: the second most popular cryptocurrency (Litecoin) is almost a carbon copy of Bitcoin with minimal changes. If people cared about techonological superiority, surely the second most popular coin would be something more innovative?
**Historical argument**. Early internet protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, E-mail) have been dominant for the last 40 years or so despite having serious problems. In particular, the world has been trying to switch from IP to IPv6 for the past ten years, without much success.

As of now that address holds 2.3 million LTC while the total amount of LTC currently in existence is 23 million.

This can only happen because of a a bug in the random number generator (e.g. what happened to Android back in August)
However, it is a good idea not to reuse addresses anyway for privacy reasons. Since you can generate as many receiving addresses as you want, you can test the wallet with one address and receive the real funds to another address from that wallet. Armory uses deterministic address generation so if one address works, all the other will too.

I think crashes ultimately serve to distribute BTC more fairly among the population. Without a strong possibility of a big crash that takes months to recover, the early adopters and other large holders would have much less incentive to sell portions of their stashes.

Every transaction (money transferred from address A to address B) gives you plausible deniability that one of those addresses doesn't belong to you.

The owners of these exchanges are most likely heavily invested in BTC (I'm thinking tens or even hundreds of thousands BTC). If they see litecoin as a threat to bitcoin, it would be counterproductive for them to further promote litecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:27:20
Yeah, this strikes me as a complete non-sequitur. It makes no sense at all comparing Bitcoin to gold and then dividing the price by the gold/silver ratio. If he thinks Bitcoin can become as popular as silver as a store of value then he should have simply taken the total value of world silver reserves as the possible market cap for Bitcoin.
Now according to wikipedia global silver reserves are 530000 tonnes or about $300 billion at today's price. Even using Woo's own methodology of dividing the price by 5 to account for volatility, we still get $60 billion as Bitcoin's market cap as a store of value.
Now silver is more volatile than gold so the "volatility penalty" for Bitcoin must be less than 5x which gives an even higher market cap.

I'd argue that a massive exodus to an alternative coin would be just as disastrous. Every Bitcoin holder will lose their investment and all infrastructure will to be rebuilt from scratch. 
Edit: to think of it, every blockchain-based cryptocurrency is essentially a fork of Bitcoin at block zero. Imagine Bitcoin switches to proof-of-stake at block 400000. What makes the 0-block fork inherently better that the 400000-block fork? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:23:03
Expectation of regulatory hurdles ahead? I think in early-mid november we all became overoptimistic with regard to acceptance of Bitcoin by governments. Now it's becoming clear that governments definitely will not embrace Bitcoin with open arms, at least in short term.
