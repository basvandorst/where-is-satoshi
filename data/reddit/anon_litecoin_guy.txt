Cool. Will there be USD deposit options? At this point, I am less impressed by user interfaces and design than by assurances that everything is legally compliant.

The article is annoying. Wallet.dat files haven't been stored in an unencrypted way for a long time now. :(

This isn't as hard of a problem as it sounds, technically. The limit could be easily raised to a few thousand TPS. It's just that nobody can agree on exactly what the new max should be, or what else should be changed while were at it.

You can always move bitcoins from your coinbase account to any other bitcoin address that you generated.
There are faster way to get bitcoins, such as bitinstant. I haven't used bitinstant in a longtime and I occasionally hear complaints about the service, but it ought to give you bitcoins within an hour.
So, you can setup a free bitcoin wallet on blockchain.info and then fund it through bitinstant and then you're good to go!

Hoarding isn't bad. Amen!

Coinbase is great!

Another reason why it's great to have alt-coins. Will be interesting to see how this gets resolved.

He/she reversed the trend... buy buy buy!

I've been using coinbase for months with very few problems. The few problems I did have were quickly resolved by support.

You're more or less right. If bitcoin was adopted for any major economic activity (global remittances or a store of value or international trade or ... etc.) then one bitcoin would be $10,000+
So, I think people selling now are being pretty short-sighted (or they want to buy back lower, which usually means the price will go up faster).

Haha, it's not often one gets a 0.000005 BTC tip. Someday that will be worth a fortune though... ;)

Any entity X which is "backed" by entity Y necessarily involves counter-party risk. If you could think of a way of decentralizing that counter-party risk, that would be interesting, however.
