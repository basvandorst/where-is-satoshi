Holy shit.  If you froze everything as it is, right now, BCH would hammer through the mempool near 8x faster than BTC would.  This isn't even debtable, it's like, the laws of physics and stuff.  So no, if BCH had the same amount of usage as BTC, right now, it would be nowhere near in as shitty shape as BTC is.  I don't even understand how you  would even come to any conclusion other than this.
Maybe BCH's 8MB blocks aren't going to work long term.  Maybe its going to centralize and the Chinese government will take it all over and everyone will be fucked. Or *maybe not*.  But one this is for certain, it can process more than BTC can, full stop.
And inferior product? Guy, they literally cut out Core's band-aids and addressed what they considered to be the root cause of the issue.  You don't have to like it, but it makes sense.

Except it's not built in.  And you need to pay, what, $30-$50USD to open a channel? Then again the same to close it.  Oh, and if you need to fund another? $30-$50!.  Oh, and you also need to keep a node online 24/7 to make sure the coins aren't stolen.  *Brilliant*.  And somehow Joe public is going to be totally cool with all of this.  Let's not even cross that whole hub and spoke potential KYC/AML bridge.
People need to be skeptical as fuck with all this "new tech".  It is not going to solve this problem any time soon.
Edit: and I really appreciate the audacity of your claims of it being "built in" while there are only toy implementations to play with.  When will the Core wallet have Lightning "built-in"?  It doesn't even have GUI support for SW yet. FFS.

Fuck yeah it is! We totally empirically proved this thing 50 years ahead of time, *awesome*.  I mean, we only greatly damaged our reputation and market dominance in doing so, but we did it!
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:03:36
Shit, *you're right*!  I heard it doesn't even track your usage or report home at all.
Again, *my bad*.

This is an excellent point! One thing I know for sure: when a person buys a Windows laptop from their local depot, the first thing they do is setup firewalls and harden it. *LOL*.
Oh wait, they were supposed to install Gentoo first, *my bad*.

BCH can process *at minimum* 2x as many transactions as BTC.  Much more than that, realistically.  *However*, they have made some compromises to achieve that.  Whether those compromises are worth the added transaction throughout is up to you, the reader.
In other words: If BTC and BCH went head to head in tx throughout all thing being equal except blocksize, BCH would win 100% of the time, every time.

Which means what, exactly?  They sell to the public. So does Canaan Creative.  Who knows what other manufacturers there are out there.
Why don't you go pee on Bitfury's tree?  They are in bed with governments and don't sell to anyone unless you have a mulitmillion dollar order.  And that's only if they *approve your application*.  Why are you people latching on to these little details without paying attention to the big picture? WTF?
Edit: And who cares about miners?  I thought we could just fire them if they dont do what we want **  Miners don't mean shit, remember?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:21:25
No, the blockchain slows because of difficulty and variance.  Perhaps you mean the mean time to get included?  Well, okay, that also depends on the variance and whatnot, but, yes tx volume will impact your availability to get space in a limited arena.  But just use the proper fee, silly! Problem solved! :D

Hello friend!  When you're in the center, you look like the right to the left, and the left to the right. ;)
Amazeballs that you think it's only those darn BCashers that make fresh new accounts to shill their junk.  Core guys would *never* do that! Eh, eh *nudge nudge*.
Wait, didn't Adam Back just admit that BS has a whole team of propaganda artists (my term, not his)? Oh oh! I guess that's what Alex Berg has been up to.
Anyways, the better version will win in the end, or both will.  I don't really care.

That other guy already mentioned that the Chinese miners agreed to run SW, twice, which is correct, btw.
The creator and original designer, Satoshi, and the initial pioneers in the space foresaw both payment channels *and* larger blocks.  They forsaw the need to for specialized node hardware.  They realized that it would take all the above to grow this.  Your current group has decided otherwise and has done so under the guise of centralization and other bogeymen.
 I ask you this: Core developers claim to be scientists.  They claim to be engineers.  So where are their studies?  Where is the data?  Where are the results, the conclusions, the recommendations? Where is the *published* studies that are driving these design decisions.  I mean, this is a multi-billion dollar industry.  Surely they are actually doing science and not acting on whatever hair-brained ideas they have come up with, *right*?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:08:13
I think you have nailed it.  Your logical reasoning is on the right track.  Don't let anyone tell you any different.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:40:47
No surprise there.  It would take a "special someone" to come up with this :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:24:14
You should ask Luke-Jr if knocking off repos is real or not.
Hey care to elucidate about the time you knocked-off cgminer? Or didn't... whichever.

I wish I knew what will happen, *I really do*.  I think you're mostly right.  It's going to be a huge flop.  Few will use it, and of those that do, some will fuck it up and lose money.  Ultimately Bitcoin as it is will retain some value because "First Mover", but ultimetely it is going to fail.
Someday books will be written about this, and some of today's popular personas are going to be fingered as the people who killed the people's money. BUT, it will totally be cool because they proved long ago Bitcoin wouldn't work, and they were right.  They just had to get involved to make sure.

Keeping it all on chain is a great experiment to continue with.  I do expect it to be more fruitful over all these other bells and whistles people are trying to bolt onto their ~~Corvette~~ Chevette.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:18:22
Hell yes. Those character qualities that brought you opt-in optimizations that only 10% of the participants use, or the qualities that brought us $50 fees. The same qualities that have seen merchants drop Bitcoin, the peer to peer decentralized cash. Those same qualities that have caused the darknet markets to start accepting other coins when they were all purely BTC for years.  The same guidance that has caused an irrepairable split in the community and the advent of Bitcoin chain hardforks.
Yeah, totally want to get behind those guys... 
Please look at the big picture.

I'm not really sure what planet you're on, but the whole premise of Bitcoin and mining is based on greed. It works on the game theory of greed.  This is exactly what the system is supposed to be doing.  How it is supposed to work.  How the fuck do you people not understand this?
LN essentially removes the fees from transactions that are supposed to pay the miners to secure the network.  Greg's fee market is making on chain transactions necessarily expensive to compensate for this.  Except with the high base fees no one can get on or off LN and the whole thing falls apart.
Fucking madness.

This reply is great.  I really appreciate looking into the minds of people who think that X coin is going to overtake Y coin in one finite instance.  I mean, I don't get that viewpoint *at all*, but more power to you.
What's really interesting is that you guys hate Ver so much, yet he was doing *the exact same thing* for Bitcoin, for like, ever.  Only now he's the devil because he continues to advocate for the same shit he always has, only you guys decided you don't like that any more.  Bitcoin is where it is today because of people like him, *LOL*.
