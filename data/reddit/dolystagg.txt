Look for a strong trending move higher. This means the range of the candles are more bullish than usual and they tend to close near the highs.After the strong move higher, the market needs to take a “break”. Here’s where you can expect a potential Bull Flag to form as the market does a pullback.

 The last position I saw the IRS taking was that you were required to recognize mined bitcoin as income when it was generated and then take a capital gain / loss when selling.

 I do not honestly feel the bitcoin was created as a substitute to fiat currency,neither is the government afraid of the bitcoin..we've all been to accustomed with that feeling/suggestion,but on a clearer note there happens to be no reason why the government should be scared of bitcoin..

 The reason why banks will always be against cryptocurrencies is that, since btc in its nature is a decentralized cryptocurrency and that they will not get anything from it when they allow all people to accept it.

 The hope of each investor from crypto assets is to feel safe, easy, and get profit, so long as they are not deceived and always get all forms of service, then crypto investors in the future will continue to exist

 5 Years is not a very long time in the crypto market but I presume that the market will rally a bit and then become stable. I am hoping bitcoin prices will rise beyond 5k USD and hoping it happens by next year.

 Being safe is our responsibilities. Problem in Crypto trading, hacking and specially scamming are cause by being irresponsible and careless in our ends.

 I think the decentralized system of bitcoin make it impossible  for any government to binned its activities.

 Mostly the public will not be willing to take risk in life especially in money that will be a hard job to change the mentality of the people .There are different opinions about Bitcoin we hear from media's and news from government

 this also a major reason some of these people oppose the crypto innovation. It indeed is a revolution

 Bitcoin is not only innovative it is revolutionary and here to stay. The rapid and aggressive incursion of the bitcoin and cryptocurrency innovation has unseated and toppled the ancient, dominant traditions that have made few men very people very powerful and allowed them have their way.

 Its true governments are against bitcoin and they believe this market is not good for the economy. But i believe their perception will change and they will accept this market.

  I think it's very unlikely in both countries in the near future. In the US Bitcoin is already very popular, but I think in the government are too many sockpuppets of wallstreet and most of them would lose a part of their power if Bitcoin gets stronger.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 07:46:03
  Do you think it's easy to topple governments just because AI and blockchain is taking over? I don't think so. We only need the governments and banks approval because they run the whole economic scene; their approval is somewhat valuable if we want to continue using bitcoin and other related services connected to cryptocurrencies without any restrictions and unfair limitations.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:15:33
 We must continue to use it, buy it, do everything to bitcoin developed and received new users. Then he will live on, improve and it is possible that skeptical authorities will change their decision about the cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:02:50
 It is still safier to buy crypto that are tested by time and even if it is higher in price the profit is much higher also. Just buy crypto investment on the money that you can afford to loose and make it grow in time. This is the best way to do in the crypto industry.

 but instead tweaking bitcoin to be compatible with a different network that is not blockchained. and then push people into using that other network

 Adoption of bitcoin among the normal people will improve the economy to a great extent. On the other hand, too much regulation hampers an economy. So, I think, adaption is better than regulaion in many ways.

 Capital Economics, the winner of the 2012 Wolfson Economics Prize for its proposal on how the Eurozone could be safely dismantled, now proclaims that Bitcoin -- a system of fast, economical, decentralized, sustainable, scalable, trustless, unhackable, and immutable data-registration -- is worthless.

 at the moment we are seeing a bit of a battle going on where bitcoin devs are actually saying blockchains and bitcoin is broke and wont work by saying it cant scale and it cant buy coffee. in an attempt to give up upgrading bitcoin.

Yes indeed bitcoin is the vehicle or we can say that this is the tool that we need for our intentions but still we are the one who run it. Bitcoin cannot say that this can stand alone without its users or without us. Because without us bitcoin for sure will be worthless and useless. We the users are the heart of bitcoin and the process and the brain is bitcoins responsibility.
