People still have physical roots, they cannot simply avoid taxation in its entirety. Sales tax, property tax, for example. I can imagine that income tax could be, perhaps, a bit more opaque but even that is tied to employers who have to report taxes and whatnot as well. If Government struggling to function is what you're worried about, it's sadly not going anywhere.

Privacy needs to be the default, otherwise it is assumed to be suspicious.

You can't opt-out of the geopolitical reality the world may face under Clinton. War with Russia, perhaps even conflict in Turkey like we see in Syria today, and an increasing flood of migrants into Europe. Not to mention censorship of the media and potentially the internet which could even impact Bitcoin. Its a global issue rather than just an American issue.
Of course, this is just what I expect a Clinton presidency would entail, and I do hope I'd be wrong, but if I'm right then we're all fucked if she wins. Trump represents a potential path to peace in the middle east, in my eyes... At the very least, he can't do worse than she would considering her track record. She would be worse than Obama, probably far worse.
On that note, I do believe Trump will win tomorrow. Hopefully he does and gets a chance to prove his doubters wrong. As a bonus, if he wins we may get to see Hillary Clinton and everyone involved with her face punishment for their crimes, particularly those they've managed to keep hidden that are starting to bubble to the surface.

Hopefully he hedged his bet, if he did it won't be too big a loss for him I imagine.

Hopefully you have some more space on that list. :p

He can't control who endorses him, that's just silly. Of course the KKK would prefer somebody who wants a border than somebody who wants open borders, but that doesn't mean Trump or his supporters agree with the views of the KKK. 
I don't recall him ever saying that he'd make Muslims register on a list, could you provide a source?
As far as hispanics... he wants to stop illegal immigration for perfectly good reasons and a lot of legal hispanics support him on that as well. He has tons of hispanic supporters.
I don't vote, and I'm not particularly pro-Trump although I do think he has the potential to do a lot of good and in fact already has done a lot of good with regards to political correctness so if nothing else that's a positive. Mostly, I was anti-Hillary as in my eyes she had not a single policy that wasn't horrible and was going to start an unnecessary war with Russia.

He didn't. Hillary Clinton and the media have spun people into a delusional rage.

Fair enough. Have a nice day.

I want Trump to win as well. Hope your wallet can handle this giveaway. :)

Colored and gay Americans also voted for Trump, are they racist? You're buying too much into the media's narrative. Check this out: 
Historically Hillary Clinton has been racist and anti-gay anyways, and people don't seem to call her a racist or anti-gay.

Damn, I just found out from your comment. What a tragedy.

I respect you for following through on this. Thanks.

I'm looking forward to Hivemind.

Darkcoin? Do you mean Dash? It still exists, they just changed their name, as I've understood it anyways.
I don't think the government stuff will be too big of a concern, governments would love sending money anonymously. Imagine how much easier sending bribes and stealing from people will be for them, or privately funding unsavory things for geopolitical reasons. Hell, they will probably use the hell out of something like Monero in the long run, we'll just likely never know about it. 
Taxes can always be collected from income tax, and worst case property tax/sales tax. Sadly those will never go away, although they may change in form. I wouldn't worry about governments functioning, they're particularly adaptable parasites.

He did say an Ethereum-like script, not necessarily Ethereum, to be fair.

If only Hivemind was out and ready... That'd be sweet. Hopefully whenever it's out we get another fascinating year like 2016 has been.

Taxation won't change, it'll just shift at best to a focus on property tax or some other variety of tax. 
But I get what you're saying about how they won't be able to print money. Still, it's reasonable they will make some USDCoin sooner than let Bitcoin or some other crypto coin take their literal money machine.

I have high hopes for IOC, but it's too early to tell whether it'll be the "next Ethereum." It's an interesting project with self-funded development and ambitious goals.
The one I believe is most likely to have a tremendous success in the future is XMR. In many ways XMR is what everyone wanted Bitcoin to be in the past (anonymous, private, etc), and although I expect Bitcoin to survive I wouldn't be surprised if it was eventually surpassed.

You can divide 100 by the multiplier to get a percentage. For example, Trump is at x1.578, so you can divide 100/1.578 = 63%. 
Assuming I am not misunderstanding, that would mean Trump has 63% of the money that has been placed, and Hillary would have roughly 42%. The numbers probably don't add up to 100 exactly due to the fees of the site itself, which I assume is 5%.

Running a business in general is terrifying from a legal point of view. I can only imagine running a business in this industry is even more terrifying. I really can't blame them for protecting themselves in that way, not much else they can really do that wouldn't put themselves at unwanted risk. Government sucks.

Good point. However, I do hope one day we get some decentralized versions of these popular social media websites. Specifically, in the case of Reddit, I believe censorship may one day drive the community to seek an alternative.
