Okay, so that all seems like your fault for using a western union transfer for the totally wrong thing. How can anyone but you be blamed for that?

Bitcoin isn't particularly used for transactions so things that harm bitcoin transactions are of marginal actual issue but are a large PR issue. So downvoting fixes the whole thing.

Bitcoin didn't really work out as a p2p system, there is a lot of questions on how to retrofit it to be some new thing. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:22:28
I don't know, lots of people "made a million" in bitcoin on paper with not much to show for it. The bitcoin foundation made many millions and have nothing now because bitcoins aren't dollars.

Why is 400 real then? Maybe the real price is 100 and 400 is as fake as 1000 was

I don't think anything even did anything from greece, I don't think greece knew or cared about anything crypto related and it was just people telling other people greece totally 4real was all into this or that crypto thing.

Given that the state of the network is an ever shrinking number of miners and nodes I think maybe a smaller block size WOULD have been better for making bitcoin the p2p system it was planned to be instead of this weird hybrid "servers/client/relay nodes" system it became.

Can anyone give a list of times roger ver has actually been correct in his predictions because this seems like a real bad sign if it goes the way of his other predictions.

If I thought the exchanges were faking prices using them to do shorts seems a really stupid idea.

since when was it a "7 billion dollar economy"? that isn't what "market cap" means.

For the last 7 years it's worked to have a userbase of just a few thousand people buying from a list of maybe 3 major retailers, 100 or so minor retailers and a few thousand weird one man scam organization and drug sellers. I'm sure some people would like year 8 to be more than that.

They don't get paid by reddit but if you look at the modlist and their jobs things like "community manager" and "public outreach" come up a lot where it's pretty simple to see how managing a subreddit is part of their job.

It's always a good sign when a movement gets to this point. Next bitcoin can hole up in a wildlife preserve

Neither of those things are protocols. Normal protocols written by adults separates the protocol from the implementations.

Bitcoin has yet to come back from that time mtgox killed it, it was 1000 then 900 then 800 then 700 then 600 then 500 and hasn't actually recovered any of those yet two years later. People are currently cheering it being 400

It's used in regular banking too, it's not magic or revolutionary

I think most bitcoin users would be fine with bitcoin being a database on the whitehouse computer that obama has to move by hand if it made them worth 100,000.

It seems pretty disingenuous to list it as "GHz" since that is already a name used for something else and seems designed only for tricking people into thinking bitcoin is more impressive than what there really is by misleading people. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:23:38
There is no such thing as "first seen" in bitcoin, it's a p2p network. What order you see things in can be anything. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:16:07
I feel like part of it is that that is a long standing concept with gold, and bitcoin attracted a bunch of people that came over from gold and just search and replaced all their gold claims as bitcoin claims without thinking about it too hard and just need bitcoin to be gold again instead of letting it be it's own thing.

oh, good thing satohsi left open times it might be a good idea when he said "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea." then!

There is not going to be hundreds of times more users by july, maybe not even by 4 years from now.

cryptographic breakthroughs? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:46:14
Edit or this from satoshi in the same thread:
I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.  The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint.

That is a fun thing to dream about but it's not a guarantee of free money and hasn't worked that way on any altcoins. Like sure, hope and dream that actually happens but don't build software off the notion it WILL happen.

How many people are behind a nation state?

And on a p2p network that need not match with what anyone else saw first and the whole point of having a blockchain was to settle that dispute. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:49:13
I'm pretty sure the miners of bitcoin are also some of the largest miners of altcoins. What do they care which you use? 
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:36:02
It does not contain the timestamp of the transaction except in some weird language game of saying whatever the time the block happened is the transaction time. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:52:45
Other open source protocols have an actual protocol written somewhere, bitcoin does things amateur hour style by having bitcoin core's behavior BE the protocol with no separate standard. Thus you can't really have anyone else implement the protocol realistically. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:04:43
Almost every single protocol? Most protocols use an open standard with individual implementations and not just some secret unwritten thing that is just "whatever this software does is the protocol".

Holy crap you should have posted the message one above that from gavin himself:
"Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later.  They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network."
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:22:33
I am pretty sure that is what everyone else on earth is saying about bitcoin. Given it's not accepted anywhere and is so tiny what is the point, what does it bring to the table regular money doesn't?

And what? extend the subsidy forever? It's dropping by 50% in a few months, fees gotta happen sometime. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:43:13
It's literally the same code as some of the altcoins, it's not magic.
@_date: 2016-01-06 01:32:16
Any proof of that?
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:21:58
Yes, nothing about that number is cryptographically protected by math or anything, it's just a number people currently agree with. People can say it wouldn't change because people right now feel so strongly about that but bitcoin is meant to be used by billions of people for hundreds of years so what a few thousand libertarians feel is important today may not always govern bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:00:40
The design that you have to guess a fee and if you guess wrong you have to wait for days to retry is absurdly broken and unacceptable. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 13:28:27
40% lower fees for the same service or 40% lower fees than some other service that offers way more things?
@_date: 2016-02-03 13:51:15
And this is good for bitcoin because as we can see bitcoin use and business exists mostly in the weakest economies? 
No wait, in every case without any exceptions bitcoin is more used and more bitcoin companies exist in the STRONGEST economies. Weird that we are always cheering for suffering in that case!!

The hilarious thing is stuff like this is a perfect cover for exit scams. You set up a wallet and refuse to let anyone audit it and tell your dumb marks that it's because you are a brave defender of freedom but really you are just a thief pocketing money left and right that knows any sort of auditing or investigation would show that instantly.

blockstream is pushing a way to do off chain transactions that requires huge signatures then surprise surprise all of a sudden the most important thing in bitcoin was a way to figure out how to make large signatures cost less fees?

Again with "trust us! we have a bunch of stuff secret but only because we are l33t haxors fighting for justice! not because we plan to steal all your money"
Which is the exact things someone stealing all the money would say.
