You can think about it as a slightly more liquid gold, as if *can* be used for purchases but with transfer fees and such it is only worth it if the purchase is large (hence only slightly more liquid than gold).

I honestly have no idea. I went to post and it said I couldn't. Have a look through my post history if you like, but I'm gonna message the mods see what they say haha

Yes mate, I've had BCH in and BTC out again since too, nice n quick. Than you for askin :)

Coinbase is always good, but to buy a substantial amount you need to be verified and have a bit of a track record so this may not be for you. Relatively low fees.
Bittylicious is super easy, with little verification needed and nearly instant availability, but again you can't buy large quantities right away. High fees though.
Localbitcoins is probably your bet, it can just be a pain as most sellers require you to provide ID, a picture of yourself, a handwritten note, and a blood sacrifice to Cthulhu. Well maybe not the last part, but it can be a pain. Fees are low (as there is competition amongst sellers), and a whole host of payment options are available.

I needed a lot of self reflection after reading that. 
Nice post

I withdrew using wex about 12h ago, still no sign of that either. How long do you think until I can expect my coins, or do they have a bitcoin threshold to reach before they send as opposed to a time?

Thank you :)

You left this up long enough for me to get an answer, thanks mods :P

Good call

But that, in my opinion, isn't the issue. The same can be said for the other sciences. However, it's classical economists refusal to accept the new found information that makes them foolish as opposed to them being disproved.

You're not wrong, which is why unless something changes in the future crypto will never be the standard medium of exchange. There will always be money: but crypto can still be a great medium of exchange. I spend a lot of crypto and i hodl a lot of crypto. It works well as a store of value and for purchasing.

Within 15 minutes i have a response from you and over on the other airdrops sub. 
Thank you :P
