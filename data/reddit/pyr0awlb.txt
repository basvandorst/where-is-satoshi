No, If I worked for BFL; I would finish the Single SC so I can start mining !!!
I have spent the whole day researching more and more.
I have already purchased my single SC in Feb and am waiting on it.
I felt rather than just 6-12 hours reading about it I would post everything I find as I do and we can all compare our information.
The truth will come out in the end...
IMHO, I dont think its a scam, They had the same issues with the FPGA miners.

its not cancelled, Its no longer available to be ordered at this stage.
The Single SC needs to be completed first. The PCB will be slightly larger on each unit and those are the same PCB that will be in the minirig.
So to clarify: its not cancelled, its just delayed the most (which sucks because it could pay itself off faster than any other ASIC miner)

I will agree with you that they need to sort out their channels for communication.
The issue is they post different information on their:
Website, Forums, Twitter, Shoutbox etc.
Its up to someone to dig through it all and find the facts.
That is what I am doing and have been doing all day. 
Ill continue to update as I can. But if you check you will see that the item is pre-order and at the time the forums had all the information about how they arnt ready.
They certainly could communicate better thats for sure.

Contrary to what the public records seem to indicate, he’s not the CEO of BFL – Sonny Chris Vleisides is not the CEO, Chris Vleisides (his stepfather) is the President (as opposed to his natural father, James Ray Houston, who was listed on the indictment) and Nasser Ghoseiri is the CEO – the confusion is understandable what with all the similar names, step and biological fathers and BFL’s seeming hatred of titles. Sonny is an upper-level executive within the company, but he’s not the absolute head, nor is his stepfather.
Even if he were the CEO, the CEO doesn’t have the ability to arbitrarily run away with much of anything. Like most incorporated entities they have a board of directors. The CEO certainly has a lot of sway with the board, but not enough to take the money and run.
Quite important sub-point: One bit of the inner workings of BFL that I explicitly got permission to publish is that almost all bitcoins received via bitpay for preorders etc. are converted to USD by bitpay and deposited into BFL’s bank account. This is important because that account is a corporate account with per-user limits, multi-signature requirements and all the standard protections enforced by the bank that keep the CEO of any company from emptying the company’s bank account. The small fraction that remains denominated in bitcoin is only what they need to process refunds reasonably quickly. Almost all of BFL’s funds are secured against embezzlement the same way most companies’ funds are.
BFL isn’t really doing anything that we’d consider scammy if they weren’t a Bitcoin business.

There is a website setup 
If you check it out you will see people have entered their details to track which orders have shipped if any.
It will be a good indication of when they ship and how fast as there are some of the early orders on there too.
