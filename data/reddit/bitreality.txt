Like I said, you can argue over which coin is more decentralized or trustless than the next.  But that is definitely not what the market cares about.  You don't get to  market cap because of how easy it is to run a node.  You get there because people are using your coin to conduct transactions.  
That's all an economy is.  A bunch of transactions.  That's by far the most basic and important utility of Bitcoin and any other coin.  If another coin does that way better, you'll keep a small niche of people preaching decentralization over utility, but the majority of the market will always choose utility in the long run.

What I'm saying is that there is no one way to measure decentralization.  Bitcoin is far from being perfectly decentralized.  Without some sort of perfectly developed AI, it is impossible for anything approaching this magnitude to ever be truly decentralized.  Centralization happens all over, from mining to discussion forums to development. 
If Bitcoin can't figure out how to greatly improve its efficiency in processing transactions soon, it's not going to maintain itself atop the totem pole.  Right now the technology is just not good enough.  Lightning Network needs to be successful, and needs to be widely adopted this year, or it will be left in the dust by the other competing technology out there.

I think that's a poor answer.  It's very difficult to truly measure which coins are more decentralized than the next.  There's many areas where centralization can happen across either system.  It's not quantifiable.
For all intents and purposes, anyone could argue why Ethereum or Bitcoin is more decentralized than the other.  You might as well call it equal.  And they're both trustless, since they're open source blockchain technology.

Right, and the fundamentals of a payment system are:
- Transaction Cost
- Transaction Speed
- Transactions Processed per Minute/Hour/Second (Actual given a premium over theoretical)
Ethereum beats Bitcoin on all 3.  Litecoin wins on 2/3.  Even BCH wins 2/3 (and I'm no BCH fan).  Bitcoin needs to be the best at all 3 of these fundamentals to have any chance at continuing to dominate the space.

Clearly there are already solutions available.  Ethereum processes more transactions than all other cryptos combined and you can send a transaction right now for under 10 cents that would confirm faster than a Bitcoin transaction with a fee of $50. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:18:38
I agree there was not enough communication about payment beforehand.  But if someone owes you $1000 and you tell them to pay you in Bitcoin, does that mean the debt is instantly converted from USD to BTC?  Just because people are using Bitcoin as a payment method should not automatically mean that debt is converted from USD to BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:27:17
The price is always Bitstamp price.  Every deal I've ever done, it's the Bitstamp price @ time of transaction.  No one wants to hold debts in BTC in the business world.  It's stupidly volatile.

It could take years for an exponential scaling solution.  In the meantime, other crypto currencies are already tackling scaling much more effectively.  Do you think Bitcoin will survive 2-3 more years of $30+ transaction fees and long confirmation times?  People are already moving to other cryptos.  Look at the transaction growth on Ethereum over the past 2 months.

There needs to at least be the opportunity for a manual review of transactions.  Not every transaction is being checked, but some definitely are.

It's the only way for the project to stay relevant.  Bitcoin Cash is clearly an alt coin and has no interesting history behind it beyond forking from Bitcoin.  It does not attract talented developers, it does not provide any interesting new technology.  It's just an old version of Bitcoin with bigger blocks.
Since it has no chance to compete on technology or talent (Bitcoin has a much more active developer community, so does Ethereum), it is competing through the classic method of "punching up".  
"Punching up is a term for deploying powerful techniques of criticism and rhetoric to critique and dismantle power structures, rather than to harm people disempowered relative to yourself."
They've actually done quite well to continuously generate controversy within the Bitcoin community.  By doing so, they stay in the public eye, since Bitcoin is the biggest and most active project in the crypto-sphere.

Which means you were fortunate enough to have kept your Bitcoin on an exchange for the split.  The people who kept their BTC in their own wallet during the split couldn't deposit BCH to exchanges until 2-3 days after the split.  It led to an artificially high price, because the supply was so limited on exchanges.
The real market price of BCH is at an all time high today.

It's true, and it's been tried many times in the past.  However, it's really hard to convince the public to just start using a new unit.  Everyone is used to using Bitcoin.  Bitcoinwisdom for awhile tried to set the default unit to 1/1000 BTC, but eventually they gave up because too many people complained.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:30:57
Bitcoin can be used however you want.  I understand people not wanting to pay a 20% fee on a micro transaction, and not wanting to wait 20 minutes to confirm.  Still work to be done for these types of use cases.  But fortunately currency has more uses than just buying a Value meal at McDonald's.

I would say the majority of active Bitcoin users are well aware they own BCH.  The inactive users have just as many dormant Bitcoins as they have dormant BCH.

No, it would have been a smaller transaction size and the fee would have been lower.  It doesn't scale 1:1 but it would definitely be much lower than $10.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:20:51
People may not act rationally in the short term.  But longer term the idea that the supply has increased 5% should result in the rest of the coins dropping 5%.  
In this case, the bigger issue would be that the creator's wallet is active, and that means a real person somewhere controls those private keys.  Most likely person being Satoshi.  If that was coupled with Satoshi coming back and being a voice of leadership for the community, I think it would actually be great for the project.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:17:29
so ~0.55% transaction fee.  Not really that bad.  Obviously it would be nice to see that being done @ $1 or less though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:30:14
Privacy perhaps, but the fees argument makes no sense.  If you are doing an atomic swap for LTC, you need to use the lightning network anyways.  So why bother switching to LTC?  It's just an unnecessary extra step.  You're both connected on the lightning network already, just use it to go BTC -&gt; BTC instead of BTC -&gt; LTC, LTC-&gt; BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:12:19
Litecoin at least prioritizes minimal fees and fast confirmation times.  That is the mission of the project.  I believe the community would respond much better to fixing scaling issues than Bitcoin has so far.  The main argument we see about Bitcoin's high costs / confirmation times is "it's like that because that's the way it is".
This is supposed to be cutting edge technology.  If people expect Bitcoin to stick around forever just because it was the first mover, they're dreaming.  Bitcoin needs to be able to continue improving and building on its technology.  So far, any minor change brings about chaos, in-fighting, and massive politics.  The community is so divided that the only way to make any meaningful changes is to hard fork into a separate currency.
I think it's largely due to the fact that Satoshi is a mystery character who has disappeared into the darkness.  If Satoshi were still around, he could give the project direction and would have the authority necessary to make important decisions.  Look at Ethereum, Vitalik and co. are able to push updates constantly.  If they said that blocks needed to double in size, they would just double them.  It wouldn't cut the community in half.
Crypto-currency needs to be easily transferable.  That's the original use case and it's just as relevant today.  Right now people are still gritting their teeth and using Bitcoin more than any other coin for money transfer.  But if things continue in the same direction as they are today, eventually another system is going to be preferred for money transfer, and once that happens you will see BTC Dominance take a nose dive.
Any crypto can be "digital gold".  It's not a distinguishing feature.  In the long run, the most popular coin will figure out confirmation times, tx fees, and scaling.  At the moment Bitcoin does not look like the coin that will do it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:35:27
To do an atomic swap with your Bitcoin wallet balance, you need a channel open on Bitcoin as well.  Essentially, someone at some point is going to pay a Bitcoin transaction fee.  Just depends how long you're willing to keep your Bitcoin in the Lightning Network.

It's just so ridiculous.  If Bitcoin somehow reached 2100T USD market cap, then you would assume that means the entire world economy would be worth at least 10x that, likely a lot more.  So in that case worth wealth would be 21K Trillion, or 21 Quadrillion.  Meaning inflation of 100x from today.  Meaning your $100M USD Bitcoin would have the purchasing power of about $1M today.
Either way, anyone arguing for $1=1 SAT is beyond delusional and has 0 concept of reality.

If they are printing Tether for any other reason than issuing Tether to a buyer at a 1:1 rate with the USD, then they are operating outside their own defined scope for their project.  For that reason, I can't see Bitfinex or Tether acknowledging it, even if it is the case.

The US government could easily cut off US citizens from exchanges.  Same idea as online poker.  Just make it illegal to service US customers on crypto exchanges.  Any exchange that doesn't comply gets their banks cut off from the banking system (Bitfinex style), and gets a $100M fine + indictment of all owners (BTC-e style).
This could be achieved overnight.  Exchanges would be given some wind down time, but that would be it.   Suddenly they face massive risks even allowing a US citizen to register.  The companies that already exist (Bitstamp, Coinbase, etc.) have too much to lose.  They'll comply immediately.  New ones may pop up but will be squashed and turned into examples.
Next step will be coming after p2p exchanges like Localbitcoins.  Same idea.  Website facilitating trade of BTC/USD with US customers = illegal.  The people running it better be willing to live the rest of their lives under the threat of a US indictment any moment they step onto US-friendly soil.
Decentralized exchanges are going to be hard to set up.  That's because you need to decentralize fiat transactions in order to properly run such an exchange.  The dollar is not set up to be decentralized.  Anywhere that stores digital dollars is centralized (banks, payment processors, etc.).  There are no digital wallets.  Digital dollars are never in your hands, so I'm really curious how a "decentralized exchange" is ever feasible.
Long story short, the US could easily wipe out Bitcoin/Fiat trading for all citizens.  Once they do so, it is likely several other countries will follow (Australia, UK, etc.).  Fiat is the weak point and is in the government's control.  Until a realistic solution is found to address that point of weakness, then Bitcoin has a pretty simple "off" switch, and really presents no risk to displacing traditional financial systems.

I think Charlie Lee is wrong here.  It's near-certain that OTC trading will be banned.  He's even acknowledged that he has no idea on the future of OTC trading.  The largest OTC website in China shut down their OTC trading last week:
So, Charlie Lee is saying that miners will be permitted to continue.  Assuming 60% of coins are mined in China, and assuming approximately 2,000 coins are mined per day, that's $4.4M USD per day @ 3700 Market Price.
BTC makes up about 48.4% of the total crypto market cap.  If we assume that China's impact on Bitcoin mining is about on par with its impact on overall crypto mining, then we can we can say they produce roughly $9M USD per day in mined coins @ today's prices.  $3.2 Billion USD per year.
So how are they going to sell these coins?  China is blocking access to foreign exchanges.  They have declared Yuan - BTC trading violates new policy.  These large mining operations aren't exactly decentralized or low key.  They can't really hide their money from the PBOC.  It will be quite clear if they are selling BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:35:37
Solution: Hold $500-1000 on an exchange.  If you're making a really large purchase, you should be able to plan ahead.  If you're worried about slippage, just buy the Bitcoin before you send it.

There's always going to be ways to cash in/out BTC in China for the technically-inclined.  It's one thing if you're an individual cashing in/out $50K or something.  It's another if you're a publicly known mining company that needs to cash out millions per week.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:02:25
Right, trying to shut down Bitcoin as a whole is not reasonable.  They feel that by starving Yuan/BTC trading, they are essentially accomplishing their goal without knocking on everyone's door that is using Bitcoin.
It will be interesting what happens in the next 3-6 months following the exchange ban.  Often the way thing works in China is that the established players have too much to lose (Huobi, OKCoin, BTCChina, etc.), so they don't take risks.  They respect the decision to shut down and they sit on the sidelines.
But new entrants will show up without much to lose, since they are new companies with no assets.  They try to find a solution that fits within the verbal agreement / written rules, but allows for CNY/BTC trading.  That's how Bitkan got big.  When all the other exchanges had withdrawals disabled in February 2017 to June 2017, Bitkan opened up an OTC exchange and dominated the market until withdrawals reopened.
We'll see what pops up next.  I have high hopes that we'll see a new form of p2p exchange in China.  Their demand will not disappear.  It's very difficult to fight against something which has demand.

The reality is that Bitcoin has acquired its value from people speculating as opposed to its actual utility in day to day life.  The technology has some ways to go before it actually becomes useful for regular spending.  Hell, a transaction I sent 1 hour+ ago has 0 confirmations right now.  I used the recommended fee on Electrum.
For bitcoin's utility to catch up to its value, it needs to provide instant and nearly-free transactions.  Until it accomplishes that, it's really not disrupting the payment processing scene.  I go to a restaurant, I swipe my credit card, I'm done.  The company has their money instantly, transaction complete.  I don't even think about it.
Why would anyone buy Bitcoin in order to pay for regular purchases right now?  I'm not talking about the die-hards that will go out of their way to use Bitcoin for things, even at their own inconvenience.  I'm talking about the average person.  Just getting their money into Bitcoin is hard enough right now.  Imagine getting them on-board without exchanges.

The USD is the most widely accepted financial instrument in the world.  It is the national currency of the most powerful nation in the world.  It was first minted in 1785.
Money's value comes from the expectation that others will accept it in return for goods and services.

Right, for the USD price to remain constant or increasing, there needs to be a LOT of USD flowing in and out of the Bitcoin system.  You can't support a $50B+ market cap without hundreds of millions of dollars everyday.  
Look at it in simple supply/demand terms.  BTC supply in the system remains constant.  This assumes the system remains accessible to some extent and coins are not effectively destroyed by the government making them impossible to access.  USD supply drops.  It's more difficult to get USD into the system.  
The difficulty acts as a deterrent to new users.  All new users buy in with fiat.  If their on-boarding channel gets blocked, new users and new money flows get blocked.  
This is really only relevant to people who care about price.  Bitcoin itself does not die.  Bitcoin can adjust to censorship and over time become resilient.  This will take time, and people who remain in the system will be rewarded, if it reinvents itself and becomes more robust.
People need to spend less time worrying about the price, and more time worrying about the technology.  If Bitcoin is expected to overcome widespread government and institutional resistance, there will be some very dark times price-wise.  It will take some major innovation and effort.  There will be moments where Bitcoin will appear nearly dead.  
But fortunately, it is not possible to kill such a thing.  It is like using an antibiotic on resistant e-coli.  The first wave will appear to have knocked everything out.  But there will always be some that survive.  And the survivors will rebuild a more resilient population.  The next wave comes, and it is less effective than the first.  Eventually, this cycle repeats itself, until the entire population that remains is immune.

They don't need to stop it in order to cripple it.  If the concern is that Bitcoin displaces traditional fiat, you don't need to stop everyone from using it.  You just need to make it difficult enough to use that the average person or business has no interest in it.
For example, right now you can buy Bitcoin or Monero, fire up your tor browser, sign up to a darknet market, buy some drugs and give your address to the seller.  Wait a few days or weeks and have some high quality drugs at your doorstep.  But the vast majority of drug users can't be fucked to do all that.  Still much easier to just find a local seller and give him cash.

1) Most fiat transfers are vulnerable to fraud
2) Most fiat transfers require sensitive personal information
3) Fiat transfers can involve heavy fees depending on payment method
It's also more difficult to trade with people internationally than domestically.  Dispute resolution is needed to be provided by the exchange.  What happens if the money gets frozen?

China is a massive market and pump a ton of money into crypto.  If the Yuan is cut off from Bitcoin then demand goes down.  Supply stays the same.  Price adjusts to new equilibrium.  Pretty basic shit compadre.

Most exchanges accept it because it reduces the compliance necessary to run the exchange.  Allowing people to deposit / withdraw / trade real USD comes with a ton of regulatory burden.  Letting people do the same with USDT, which pegs to the USD but is technically still just another crypto currency, allows for much less regulatory and legal risks.

Tether, by its own description, is only printed when purchased for real money at a 1:1 rate with USD.  There is no scenario that Bitfinex/Tether should be printing Tether to modify the market exchange rate.

The article states that all types of trading between Yuan and Crypto  are banned.

ummm, $1 per satoshi is simply impossible.  There's 100M satoshis in a Bitcoin.  So at that rate 1 BTC = $100M.  21M Bitcoins in existence, so 21M * 100M = 2100M^2, or 2,100 Trillion dollars.  Be realistic my dude :D  Total global wealth is 280T.

The problem is USD (and other fiat currencies).  Governments can quite easily cut off access to banking for exchanges if they start feeling threatened.  If it continues to grow, and the technology advances to the point that Bitcoin becomes a true substitute for fiat currency in common use cases, then expect to see governments take action against it.
The most simple and effective way for governments to attack crypto is by regulating exchanges to oblivion or just flat out removing their access to the banking system.  They are by far the weakest part of the system, and despite what your Libertarian friend might tell you, crypto needs to be exchangeable for USD in order for it to be useful.
Perhaps this may lead to true decentralized exchanges, although these pose many challenges which have not been tackled.  Once again, all on the fiat side.   
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:06:03
I hope you don't actually believe that printing USDT is equivalent to the US government printing USD.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:52:11
I'm telling you that decentralized exchanges don't work.  You're telling me that they do work for fiat.  But you've clearly never used one.

I mean, at high levels it's reasonable to assume things could work a bit differently.  There's no information that I've seen which shows BTC-e using the banking system to cash any of these guys out.  The majority of claims are just that the coins, at some point in time, were hosted on BTC-e or on wallets related to BTC-e.  
Any major criminals could probably have figured out a complicated way to obfuscate the origin of their coins, and that method could have involved using BTC-e.  Cashing in there and out with another crypto or payment system could be a useful step in laundering your money.  But the idea that BTC-e was just sending out USD wires to people who provided only an email at signup is bullshit.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:36:37
Right, and nobody is claiming the FBI did anything in Russia.  They confiscated servers / equipment supposedly located within the USA, and Vinnik was in Greece.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:15:28
For anything related to banking (wires), I had to submit my ID.  That was default for everyone.  You could not withdraw or deposit USD without submitting your identity docs.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:45:01
His underlying point is that the exchange is lying and that they never had servers or infrastructure in the USA, because they are Russian.  He is claiming they are fabricating the FBI seizure, despite an announcement on justice.gov stating the contrary.  He's out to lunch.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:22:01
You could withdraw using PerfectMoney, BTC-e voucher code, etc.  But you'd basically just be moving the issue to another platform in terms of getting USD out.  Perhaps some high-volume / grandfathered accounts were treated differently, but I've seen no evidence of that. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:40:50
People who bank in the USA are afforded certain rights.  Not the case on a Russian bitcoin exchange.  I'd expect this case to follow the route of civil forfeiture.  In the case where the funds belong to a non-US citizen, I seriously question whether civil forfeiture is ever legal.  But I imagine it won't stop them from trying.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:32:00
Because you're delusional.  They've done the exact same thing before.  Here's some literature: 
Read up.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:20:13
You can't speculate on how they've set up their servers.  The indictment specifically states that the FBI seized BTC-e and that they had servers located in the US.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:37:00
From what I've heard it will be more similar to a civil forfeiture case.  Your assets are assumed guilty until proven innocent.  You'll need to provide a ton of information on where every dollar came from, and it may require going to court.  Not sure about non-US citizens.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:20:35
It's ambiguous enough to be impossible to challenge.  Which servers are they talking about?  Could even just be the Cloudflare servers.  Could be the servers for their forums.  I highly doubt BTC-e held all its servers for the exchange in the United States.
All they need is some way to loosely explain why they entitled to prosecute BTC-e.  Anything that links them to the USA, no matter how minor, will be amplified in the court case to support them having jurisdiction.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:21:42
Not really a fair comparison.  The US police never entered Russia. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:49:00
BTC-e verified my identity, they have my ID.  I used real information.  Plenty of others did as well.  People also have control of their login details, 2 FA, and email addresses linked to the service.
If the FBI is at all interested in repaying the numerous legitimate stakeholders of BTC-e, they certainly could do so.  Mt Gox allowed users to log in, check balances, and claim ownership after the dust settled in their hacking.  It's easy.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:26:25
Do you think Karpeles stopped every single tainted BTC that hit the Mt Gox exchange?  The claims allege that some of the funds stolen from Mt Gox were deposited right back onto the exchange.  And cashed out.
So before everyone starts acting like BTC-e was the only exchange that "criminals" used, take a quick reality check.  Criminals have used Mt Gox, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, etc.  Just as criminals have used HSBC, Bank of America, etc.
So before you all start buying into the bullshit narrative that an exchange is by extension responsible for every criminal that gets their money onto the platform, realize that you are condemning the entire exchange ecosystem at the same time.  
It's not possible for an exchange to weed out every criminal.  Each exchange has different methods of verifying customers, and complies with different regulations based on their location.  The FBI could certainly close down nearly any Bitcoin exchange currently operating based on their charges.  If you want to live in a world where you can freely exchange BTC for $, then you need to realize that the BTC-e closure is a threat to Bitcoin in general.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:45:58
You have a much better chance recovering money from BTC-e than from the FBI.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:04:12
The coins ended up on multiple exchanges.  BTC-e appears to have the largest percentage, but other exchanges (including Mt Gox) ended up with stolen coins as well.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:27:35
You're trying to argue that the exchanges closed crypto withdrawals for no reason?  Just to mess with the markets?  That's ridiculous.  There was a confirmed investigation which is still ongoing by the PBOC.  Disabling withdrawals crippled Huobi / OKCoin dominance, volume, and revenue.  
The exchanges wanted nothing more than to reopen withdrawals and get proper volume back.  They were clearly under a severe threat of punishment from the PBOC and were left with no choice but to close crypto withdrawals until they could properly address PBOC requests and demands.
Find a better place to wear that tinfoil hat.
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:46:14
"Except the PBOC never told them to halt withdrawals. There's no reason to disable them."
Such an absurd statement.  How on Earth do you know what the PBOC said?  Where do you get your information?  Any source?
One thing I think we can all agree on is that the PBOC was, and most likely still is, investigating Chinese BTC exchanges.
That article and many others confirm this investigation as of Jan 2017.  You're proposing that, in the middle of an active investigation, every Bitcoin exchange in China (competitors, separate businesses) came together and agreed to suspend withdrawals because all of them were simultaneously insolvent.
Your theory doesn't add up.  If the exchanges all acted purely on their own behalf to disable withdrawals, why didn't one exchange go against the grain and continue operating as usual?  Why did every single exchange in China disable withdrawals at the exact same time?  These are separate organizations, why would all of them become insolvent at the exact same time, and why wouldn't a new exchange just come and steal their market share?
