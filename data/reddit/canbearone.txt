"Visa described the regulations as "unprecedented" and Mastercard said it could experience difficulties, the Russian magazine Snob reported, after Vladimir Putin signed a law on Monday to create a rival national payment system."
They could experience a serious loss of money if will lose this market.

the best thing of bitcoin-you cannot trace who sell or exchange it for cash..maybe it's not the government at all

Great work, man!! But..only one question: do you plan to make .exe on this for Windows? As it's hard for me to use your instructions..

Ohio is in US. I think that they are afraid of the following after accepting BTC government restrictions.

I'm surprised Ireland is 23%! How it can be explained? Lots of freelancer live there?

plus you can't buy drugs or guns with paypal...yet!
@_date: 2014-04-28 06:33:49
absolutely agree, the higher the exchange rate, the more attention it gets, like it was with the silk road
@_date: 2014-05-04 08:47:11
Wow!! That's very impressive! The price of it should be more impressive =D

Their government would never do this, a large percentage of their people might though. As well as the people of Ecuador, Egypt, Pakistan, Venezuela, Belize, Cuba, Cyprus, Greece, Jamaica, and Ukraine

Cool! But all of them are in USA..what about other countries? By the way, everything looks yummy!

"Bitcoin is not readily acceptable: If you walk into Starbucks and try to buy your espresso with bitcoins you will probably encounter a confused-looking barista. If you cannot transact with a currency, it is not currency."
Just taking its time..i believe a couple of years and it will be acceptable almost everywhere

It's pretty hard to grow when PoW transfers hundreds of millions of dollars from the Bitcoin eco-system, into the pockets of hardware vendors and electric company. Also, the worst thing is even if Bitcoin does manage to grow, the leeching effect of PoW will grow too.

I've seen an idea like this before somewhere, I think there would need to be a lot of transparency around the bidding process and current bids. This does add the element of competition though which is always interesting.

You didn't tell how did your earn them, mining is like passive placements of fund, they work for you, so if you were doing nothing while the computers worked i believe it is not a great amount to grieve for.

As long as bitcoin doesn't have some proof of delivering goods it won't replace paypal.. :(
@_date: 2014-05-02 04:57:02
I agree with what you wrote, but only one question: why do you think that "1 bitcoin will be worth $10,000 within a year or two"? The current exchange rate fluctuates btw 428$-453$ per BTC. What calculations did you use?
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:06:21


At first I was thinking the same as you here, but the numbers quickly change if you wanted 500 or 1000 coins (aka multiple blocks) generated to a single address.
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:56:02
Just will shut it down. I won't be surprised is anonymous group will DDOS it just before it comes up to 49%

I think some mechanism should be created to counter this losing bitcoin problem. In my mind, the stuck bitcoins in specific block take a specific period of time to release that coins to miners. Or binding your email address with private key, after specific period, the owner can validate your bitcoin in the blockchain using email.
