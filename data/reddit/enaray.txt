Massively misleading, clickbait title

No it didn't. One website (TorGuard) is taking lightning payments via special request. The fees for that are basically zero (after setting up the payment channel). For the entire rest of the internet, fees are still high. Don't spread BS.

I am hopeful for lightning network also.


no-one else in the crypto currency space, yes. But it isn't about Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, it's about crypto compared to other payment methods, and massive companies like Steam adopting Bitcoin and then ditching it altogether is bad for the crypto space as a whole. That is the backward step I am talking about.

because they are too fucking high.

100% agree. So glad to see a post like this on It upsets me that sites accept Bitcoin payments, but it just doesn't make sense for me to use that option anymore, and now the biggest sites like Steam are disabling the option. It's like we're going backwards.
I support a blocksize increase.

well shit?! who knew it was THAT easy?
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:18:41
How about, somewhere other than Reddit?

Please don't make the same mistake twice (selling low and buying high)

people dont seem to realise that bitcoin got it's value from it's utility. from the ability to send anywhere instantly, with virtually no fees, with no third parties.
as you say, without that utility, what is it? it's worthless. it can't be just a store of value and nothing else.

"soon" to be confirmed

for real?! why would you use 1/4 inch steel plate anyway? overkill?
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:30:39
Sounds like a great excuse to me!
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:52:05
it's still too expensive and slow, compared to how it used to be.

41 dollars for a haircut? seems legit.

Did this guy forget what happened literally two months ago?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:33:56
Bitcoin is the protocol, Bitcoin core is just one implementation of that protocol. No. Terrible idea.

We haven't won jack shit. These posts are fucking delusional.

Bitcoin broke through 11k for the first time since 19 days ago
