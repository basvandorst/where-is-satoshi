How do Devs change the bit coin protocol? How is it possible that only certain devs have access to something that is decentralized? Can I change the protocol? How does this get governed?? Isn't this a security risk? People talk about devs making changes?  Or can only some parts of parts of it gets changed?

Why do things that are Unnecessarily? Or do you think there is a chance that 12 word seed is not enough?

Cheers, i'll check out electrum. Haven't read anything about it yet.
Will we ever be able to trust just one app on our phone?

I have the word list written down, i also have mycelium installed on my old android phone
Thanks for clarifying the 12 word master question, but then why do people make 24 word seeds if 12 words is so secure?

I see - thanks.
Paper wallets it is.
It's just so convenient having your coins on your phone!
Oh well, better to be safe. I hope this is something that can be improved somehow.

Hmmm okay. Thanks guys.. Guess I will look at cold storage options or Paper wallets.
It's something I haven't learnt yet, but it is something I really should :)
PS. It sucks that people don't even trust an app with your coins!

Eh, i'm in australia so i'm not much help :)
Good old google search online sounds like a plan

That's good to know!
I generally stay away from dodgy websites and dodgy apps. I read that Beeg.com (Free porn streaming) as had malware in the past.. so if its not from that the Only other way I would get something is if a PC i am charging off has malware.. Work PC or home PC.
But i'm sure someone has or is developing malware for Mycelium, after all it's pretty popular!
