Well it's very much like both.
It's a lottery that is free to enter, it only costs the time to calculate the math problem.  With a faster computer you can complete more math problems in a given amount of time, you can generate more lottery tickets.
As the difficulty increases, the kind of math problem actually stays the same, it takes just as long to solve a single problem and generate a single "ticket". What gets harder is that the number of winning tickets goes down (for instance, instead of 1 in 1 billion being a winner, it's 1 in 1.2 billion).

This is interesting.  I think the concept of DAOs is amazing! Truly game changing! But I have had some of these concerns about DAOs myself, from a more technical perspective (rather than a legal liability perspective). The question is,  if you design a DAO, but there's a slight programming flaw allowing for people to exploit some aspect of the organization, how do you fix it? 
If you compare a DAO to a constitution, another set of rules that defines an organization, a major difference is the ability to amend or repeal changes to a constitution.  So it seems to me, to makea DAO work long term, you would need to program in a modular way,  so you could enable or disable modules (amendments) if need be.  The question now however,  is who gets to changea DAO, and what good is a DAO if it can be changed on a whim?

I don't think that's a great argument when it comes to technology 


That's like Hewlett Packard asking "What would ordinary people want with computers?"
I mean, why would anyone need a 1GB Hard drive in 1995; you could never fill that even to 50% capacity with word documents.  But once these drives were available, it wasn't long before "mp3" was a household word and people wanted more space.  My point, is just that people don't actually know what they want until they have it, but you have to make it first.
But I totally agree with everything else you have to say.  If the code's no good, well that's just about it.  We just need to wait and see if they can produce results.

Computers do EXACTLY what they're told to (whether it was the programmer's intention or not). I believe this concept is what was meant by "the tyranny of code".  Once executed, the  code can't be reasoned with, it's absolute and completely without mercy.

Yeah, I've been calculating this myself on paper.  It definitely only works with a high percentage of the total hashrate, 33% does look to be the turning point.  Otherwise you just lose too much money from lost rewards when you fail to solve the block you have an advantage on.
It seems to me, the way to defeat this kind of attack, with bitcoin as it exists today, is with p2pool.  At the time of my writing,  shows only 1 pool has over 25% hash rate, so only one party could even do this if they tried.  But if people just used p2pool instead of mining pools in general, this attack would be impossible for any party.

Actually, I bought my last two miners with bitcoin.  But if you really insist on believing you're right, then go right ahead and believe whatever you like.
Also, while I'm at it, I didn't even need to buy my first miners, after all, that was really the intended process from the very beginning.  My first miners were the cpus and graphics cards I already owned, it was taking advantage of the advanced technology that would otherwise sit at dormant, and instead actually put their power to use any time I'm not actively using it.  Mining is complicated, yes, but it's not a problem or impediment in any way.
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:07:36
I don't know man, I think things are really working fine, it's just that the whole world doesn't change overnight.  It may be that the tech elite are the first on the scene for bitcoin, but that's not actually a problem.  The same could be said for the internet, and sure enough the internet was still a success, it just took a few years.  It's not like there's any rush.  Besides, it's all inevitable anyway, the genie can't be put back into the bottle at this point.


I disagree with this.  I'm not sure bitcoin can be accurately explained if it's massively dumbed down.  Likewise, I'm not sure you can *easily* explain it without massively dumbing it down (or misrepresenting it).  The problem isn't that the geeks who understand it enjoy being elitist, it's that bitcoin is actually a difficult to explain and to understand.  Nobody is trying to be difficult here, some things in life are actually just complicated.  Speaking of which, comparing things to other things is exactly how we humans break down complicated ideas, you may have to get over that.


But the thing is, they do care how much fees are, they just don't realise it.  The fees involved in transferring funds affect the final price of any products purchased with those funds.  If Visa's fees reduce your business's profit margin too much, then you're forced to increase prices to stay afloat.  lower fees = lower prices (and people do care about prices).  This is why you'll see "cash only" gas stations (and why they're often cheaper).  
As for the time it takes to send money, they care about that too, I promise.  I'm sure everyone at some time has deposited a paycheck to their bank account, then tried to withdraw that money right away, only to be told "oh that won't clear for a day or two".  Basically, that money you just deposited hasn't been verified yet and two days can be a long time.


Yes, exactly. And as a barcode means nothing to someone without a barcode scanner, a QR code means nothing to someone without a smartphone.  
Bar codes are only useful when the alternative is typing in a 12 digit item number for every item you need to identify.  Likewise, QR codes are just a useful alternative for obnoxiously long 34 character bitcoin addresses.  The farmer still won't care, unless sticking his qr code on his produce saves him time, then he'll care.
Finally, Just as if people google hotmail, they get hotmail.  If people google coinbase, they get coinbase.  I find Coinbase to be every bit as simple as paypal.  So If you can grasp paypal, then with coinbase, you can use bitcoin. You can even send money using email addresses, just the same way paypal does it.

Who told you that?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:52:25
If you accepted everything leading up to that, then I guess your gripe is with the my use of the word "safe".  Honestly, safe is a spectrum, or a curve; there are varying degrees of "safe".  What I was trying to express was that using Linux does not in any way make you invulnerable.
As for open source software, I mostly agree.  I am much more inclined to trust open source software when it comes to security, as a rule, it's basically always the most secure solution for exactly the reasons you point out.  That said, open source is definitely a double edged sword.  It allows you to put many pairs of eyes on a problem and route out any potential flaws.  But at the same time, being able to see the code absolutely **does** make one aspect of exploiting software easier - transparency naturally gives an attacker more information, knowledge of the internal mechanisms give one more of an idea on where to focus their efforts in developing an attack. 
Again, I think open source software is clearly the superior approach for security, but it's not foolproof or invincible simply for being open source - I've been in bitcoin for far too long to think that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:15:47
Are you kidding?  There are certainly numerous opportunities to be exploited within linux.  One aspect of the job is even easier, as you don't need to reverse engineer anything - you can see how all the various parts interact.
The fact is, once in a while a flaw is discovered that went unnoticed for years, sometimes decades. Sometimes new tools or methodologies become available that make a system once thought to be secure suddenly vulnerable.  Luckily, many smart people are looking at the linux code, keeping it as secure as possible.  Unfortunately however, many smart people from around the globe are paid sizable salaries just to find ways to break it.  It simply isn't safe.
Also, an operating system on it's own has the potential to be safe, but once you start adding software to it, its attack surface increases greatly, i.e. You don't have to beat Linux if you can get what you need by exploiting a flaw in firefox running on Linux.

It might also break as an analogy simply because it isn't totally accurate.

The NSA is like a communications, hacking and electronic warfare oversight group.  They develop the methods and procedures that other agencies like the CIA, FBI and military intelligence use to do actual investigation and espionage.

Something tells me that you are still thinking about Bitcoin...  Citibank is not making Bitcoin; Bitcoin already exists, there would be no value in recreating it.  The one thing I don't think you're seeing is that blockchain technology is bigger than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is just one implementation of one use for this technology.  
And as far as your theory on what bitcoin is good for, I think you aren't understanding *where* in Bitcoin the value actually resides.

Why is anyone assuming it would be a consumer coin at all?  It seems to me that these technologies are perfect for banks, if only for moving money around internally as a back-end technology that the public never has to see.
Ultimately, I think all financial institutions are going to need a cryptocurrency backbone in order to eliminate inefficiency.  They'll need it to just to be able to compete in the market.
I say good for them, that they're at least getting started with understanding the technology.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:56:54
Why assume their system even uses mining? Mining is only useful for distribution, I would think they would start with all their tokens predefined. And there's no reason to assume they're using a totally decentralised system, I mean they could design something totally immune to that kind of attack because consensus doesn't matter.
And besides, the point is really simple, trustless systems are superior to systems that require trust. So use those whenever possible.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:34:14
Part of the reason the public ledger is so great is you can't cheat it.  In a large organisation, more reliability can be a good thing.  For example, the Washington branch can't always be looking over the shoulder of the Singapore branch.  This is another area where trustless systems can be very helpful.
@_date: 2012-01-27 22:56:24
I'd also like to know more about this.  
Even with this is place though, I can still see some scenarios that will require trust.
I assume for instance, that a seller would wait to ship an item until the buyer sends the requested funds to escrow, then the buyer would confirm the item's delivery and the btc transfer would be completed.  But what if the buyer receives an item, but never confirms the arrival, maybe just forgets, he's still paid for an item, but the seller will never receive the payment.
@_date: 2012-01-27 18:18:11
Yeah, that's exactly right.  You can always dig deeper; for an increased cost, there's always more to find. 
And to clarify another aspect, there really *isn't* a finite quantity of gold available.  If the demand ever surpassed the supply by so much that the it became profitable to mine all existing gold on earth... we'd eventually just look elsewhere or figure out how to make it rather than find it.

Well I think Paypal is an apt comparison.  Bitcoin isn't really meant to replace local currencies, but rather to work along-side them. You have to remember, that while bitcoin is technically a currency, it's really just a service by way of a currency.  Bitcoin allows you to practically anonymously transfer funds electronically, and basically for free, thus "electronic cash".  This is all very very convenient and it's the primary reason to use it.  The fact that it's also it's own currency is interesting, but not any reason to use it.
So the way I see it, bitcoin will never replace (and rarely even effect) local currencies.  It may however replace much of the middleman money transfer services (paypal, visa, western union, etc).
*edit:* and as you said, it could totally become the new money exchange system, another utility that will help it become ubiquitous.

Or transfer funds to a paper wallet and simply mail the hardware wallet to your destination.  No dealing with explaining the device to customs/security, and when you get to your destination, you can return to using your hardware wallet.
In the worst case scenario, if anything happens to the hardware wallet in transit, then you just buy a new one, so you're out $100 but you still have all your digital funds. And outside of a total fedex fail, you shouldn't need to worry about that.
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:09:04
This method does seem over complicated compared to the last.  
However, this method does have one major advantage; This design allows for an m-of-n  lock.  At [1:45]( you can clearly see the bar that actually holds the gate closed (on the left).  The longer you make that bar, the more padlocks need to be removed before the gate opens.
Also, personally, I would prefer a system that doesn't involve removing one of those pegs entirely.  It seems likely that one could design a system where sliding pegs just flip up or down like a standard [gate latch](

I do however like the idea of merging game currencies and real currency.  There could be many advantages to intertwining actual currencies into games, things like dlc and expansions become more straight forward, as well as paying for server costs.  I really like the idea of a self sustaining servers for instance, where playing the game also pays the server bills.  We wouldn't need to worry about the game just disappearing some day, simply because the devs don't want to support it any more.

That is a very good question.  The answer could be controversial though...
For a long time it was quite confusing why anyone would oppose that.  Honestly, on some level change is always scary, so some will always oppose change (at least when money is on the line).  But recently it's come to light that there may be other reasons to oppose this change. There is a very specific trick that could be used to mine bitcoin more efficiently (like up to 30% more efficiently), it's called asicboost.  It's complicated, but with enough effort anyone could use this method, which would give you an advantage over competitors who haven't figured out how to implement it yet.  Here's the the thing, among all the positive things segwit would do, one side effect is that asicboost would no longer work.  So now any miners actually using this kind of asicboost process are actually incentivised to oppose the segwit proposal. 
**TL;DR** Some miners figured out a trick to mine faster than other miners, but the trick won't work after BIP148 (Though there's no way to prove definitively that anyone is using this asicboost method).  
Also there's a legitimate fear of change.

I'm invested in GPU mining myself, I have 900 Mh/s at home and there's definitely still some value in GPUs, but it is dropping by the day.  Had I bought those cards 2 weeks ago, I'd never break even.
However, ASICMiner keeps adding more hashing power and they're likely to stay a large percentage of the total network hashing power going forward (at no additional cost to investors).  That's the difference right there, my cards will trail off untill they aren't worth the energy cost, but ASICMiner stocks *may* produce returns as long as bitcoin exists.

Don't be so sure, price cuts can do amazing things. If you want a real case study, just look at Valve.  But for one thing, the price cut isn't *just* an adjustment to the market, it's also free advertising.  How many articles and blog posts did you see when ASICMiner cut their prices for the usb sticks in half?  How much press does Microsoft get when the XBox gets so much as a $50 price drop?

The first automobiles absolutely did require this much of a learning curve.  People literally died attempting to start their car.  You had to manually crank the engine to get it to turn over and sometimes the engine sent the crank flying into the would-be driver.  this was the normal process of starting the car. 
But years passed, the technology got better, and eventually practically everyone could operate a car.  Now cars are safer than ever... but you still need to earn a license to drive them.
So in my opinion, bitcoin probably isn't really ready for "prime time", but that doesn't mean that bitcoin is never going to make it.  Cars make a fantastic example, they're complicated as hell and most people don't know exactly how they work (certainly not enough to fix them when they break down), but cars did take off eventually, just give bitcoin time.
And for the record, I don't recommend most people attempt all their own auto repairs.

First, it's pretty funny seeing the full page ad for Mt.Gox before the article referenced.
Second, this quote:


around two of the most proliﬁc types of 
criminal internet activity:
• **The sharing of images and videos of child 
abuse online among pedophile groups;** and
• Fraud and criminal ﬁnancing, which 
includes funding terrorist operations.
I have to ask, how common is this really?  I hear about measures to counter child porn all the time.  I understand that 99% of the time it's a lie; it's just an easy moral opinion to get people to rally behind, but rarely the real motivation behind any proposed measures.
That said, I have to wonder, is kiddie porn even a big thing?  I mean, sure, in a [rule 34]( kind of way, yes it's very real. But how pervasive is it?  
Is this a crime like tax evasion (something that happens quite often that directly effects a country's government and in turn it's citizens), or is it more like breaking a Chicago law that bans poodles in an opera hall (something that must happen, but realistically effects pretty much no one)?
Also, if child porn really 


nations, all businesses and, most importantly, 
billions of citizens around the world"
 then how does it harm them exactly?
Not that I would try to defend the practice, but how *actually* harmful is it to society? Is it harmful, or just disgusting?  I mean slime mold is disgusting, but we aren't fighting it at an international level.  Does anyone have specifics on the subject?
*Edits: grammar is hard*

I'm actually not sure transport is really even a relevant cost.
When commodity traders deal in gold, do they actually deal with shipping and storage logistics?
Also, assuming nations would actually need to move physical gold at some point, wouldn't they just set up a tab? Like whenever a transaction is made, they can say "IOU 600 kg gold", then once a year before everyone calculates next year's budget, they can actually transport whatever difference is left after tallying all of that year's transactions.
So I guess storage would still be an issue, but it shouldn't have to be accessed often.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:24:24
Right, but does more transactions increase processing time? And how much?

Agreed. I actually realized just the other day, that what makes Bitpay different from payment processors like say... Visa, is that you aren't locked in after you start using it.  
You could stop using Bitpay at any time and switch to some other bitcoin based payment processor, and the customer would never even notice the difference.  For the customer, the entire interaction involves  copying a link or scanning a QR code, all the payment processor stuff is done on the merchant end.  
So if you don't like something about Bitpay, change your bitcoin payment service, but if you don't like Visa, you'd have to say goodbye to a large portion of your customers.  In this way Bitcoin could really protect businesses from bullying by payment processors.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:25:01
Agreed, why crash the system when you can profit from it.

Yeah, I'm with Fourdrinier, I say no.  An adding machine is not a computer.  It may help you add sums very efficiently, but it can't do anything else.  You can use it for it's intended purpose, but you can't use it for anything else.  
The magic that makes a computer more than just a machine is programability.  The ability to alter and reconfigure the internal mechanisms that make it do whatever it's doing on the fly.   It's the ability to be every machine you ever wanted it to be, and every machine you never could have known you needed it to be.
Bitcoin is something fantastic, something game changing, perhaps even the foundation of a new era.  It's just not really a computer.
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:26:59
First, your in-game economy would be more valuable than your game.  This may not be a big deal, but it could potentially be problematic for any kind of game, MMO or otherwise.  A good example would be *Magic the Gathering*, many of the cards in MTG have a high collectable value.  As a result, people are known to simply not play with their high value cards, or use proxy cards in their place, or just sell all their good cards to recoup the cost of playing.  But people only go to all that trouble because MTG is a very good game, well balanced, well designed, competitive.  If the game itself wasn't as good, the cards would be little more than trading cards, people would just stop playing (like pogs, remember those?).
Imho, there are plenty of different ways to make a good game, but this isn't a great direction to come from if the desired result is a good game.  (if the desired result is an interesting use of bitcoin, then have at it.)

Wow...  Qubes OS is really really cool.
I love that this kind of security is finally becoming viable.  Android now has support for "profiles" which in theory could keep different sets of apps, different contacts (and hopefully in the future, completely different file systems) for different profiles like "work" "home" "kids" etc.

Security doesn't have to be complicated.  i.e. for most users, you do not need to boot from a self compiled linux live disk every time you access your account.
The bottom line is, password protect everything, use long passwords.
I do mean **long** passwords, but necessarily complicated ones.  I highly recommend a short phrase, something you can remember.  Here's an example 
It's an easy to remember phase *"Sally's birthday was worse than Sam's"* but at the same time it's hard for a computer to guess through brute force.  That password uses 32 characters and includes some symbols and some uppercase characters; that makes for a hard nut to crack.  How long *would* that take to brute force? Using current computer technology it would take more than a trillion, trillion, trillion times the age of the Universe.
**TLDR:** It does not take superhuman measures to make good passwords

or the GRC [password haystacks]( page

He seems to be.  He posted here a while back, to let us know he'd be giving a talk.  There's a larger conversation in that thread: 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:52:00


Well I absolutely disagree with this statement.  Why? Because you cannot simultaneously pickpocket 150,000 people's physical wallets.
However, there's no reason someone couldn't write a worm that targets standard bitcoin installations on windows (or android, or anything else), and literally pickpockets 150,000 oblivious users simultaneously.
You're only more likely to lose a physical wallet *today.*  Massive high tech theft hasn't happened yet, only because there hasn't been a large enough target yet. Viruses have already targeted bitcoin wallet.dat files, it's just a matter of time until someone writes some very, very, clever malicious code.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:36:41
OK, so...
* A RAID system is simply a drive, this does not add security.  
* Dual cross-site backups means storing your precious data in several places as well as transferring that data through the internet several times to get to those various storage locations (keeping in mind that the capture of any 1 copy of your wallet is all that's needed to access your account).  Each time your private key is backed up and transfered is another chance for it to be intercepted.
* 2 step verification is actually really useful, and is not incompatible with a hardware wallet.  In fact, this is essentially the role played by the pin you enter before using the hardware wallet.
Do you know why the little brick is more secure than any other current implementation?   The whole reason it's secure is that it never sends private data anywhere.  The wallet itself is single purpose computer, you use it to create a transaction, then digitally sign that transaction with your private key (only stored within the device).  Since there is just no mechanism that would let the key leave the device, there's no opportunity for the key to be stolen or intercepted in any way.  The wallet needs to be plugged into a computer only to update the blockchain with the already completed transaction.
Now of course the brick itself can be physically modified or stolen, even with cash or gold, there's no way to protect against physical theft (besides a heavy safe or an armed guard).  But stealing the device would be like stealing a locked safe, it may be easier to crack once in a criminal's possession, but it's still no easy task.
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:48:02
So why don't they use gold, or some other commodity?

That's true, software and hardware are very different beasts.  But they do have way more production capacity than pretty much all their competition.   That's why they're using relatively outdated 130nm technology, way more chip fabs can produce those chips, so they aren't limited to just a handful of super high tech fabs.
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:26:00
I'm so sorry man.  I absolutely understand the situation you're in.
I ordered in Nov and spend 45 or so BTC on a 30 GHash unit.  I've been pretty stressed about the entire situation, but in the end they did ship my miner a week and a half ago.
It's still a huge loss though.  I mean I definitely would have been better off just saving that BTC.  But, assuming I consider it a $700 purchase and don't adjust for the change in value of BTC... through that logic I'll break even in a month or so, then maybe make $100-200 on top of that. But this was not at all what I was hoping for.
So the short version: I was a lucky one, and I lost a lot of money.

Wow, so that's really pretty silly.  I really like that I have the FDA to guarantee a minimum amount of arsenic in my food.  I really like that there's a police force to make sure I'm not attacked on my way to work.

More shares *could* be issued, but they expressly said they would not issue more, ever.  So they could, but it would be a major breach of the agreement made with investors.  
It would probably be a terrible idea and could seriously damage the company, but hey anything could happen right.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:43:33
Honestly, my suggestion is skip it.  Unless you're actually going to read every line of code (and spend time analysing it), what's the point of compiling the source yourself?
Instead, just download the iso for the [distro]( you want and make a effort to actually verify that it's the correct file. All those distros will have a pgp signature or a md5 hash, so you can independently verify that the iso is what it's supposed to be.

Yes, you can say "use x intermediate nodes".  so controlling all those intermediate nodes would be pretty tricky.  Although... more nodes means higher latency and lower performance, so it's not a great situation for users either.

More than partially, as the Bitcoin network has only one function (keeping the bitcoin network running), I wouldn't even call it a computer.  The bitcoin network is more of a huge distributed single purpose machine than a supercomputer.  Like a calculator, or a toaster, but very big.  If the bitcoin network could be programmed to do other calculations, then it would be a computer.  But these days, much of the hardware the network is made of is single purpose as well, so it really can't change.
