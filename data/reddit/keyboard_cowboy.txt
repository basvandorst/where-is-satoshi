I told my friend making a blank account with GOX when he had nothing to trade was not good idea, he gave all possible information , updated, photscanned and everything to mtgox.only thing he didnt give is dna sample. he is completely wrecked and is now in process of changing some of the documents as its extremely sensitive information. felt so bad didnt even make fun of him.

Every two year its said we are due another recession , japan has been going through this total doom and gloom 'economy will be completely destroyed' prediction for decades, it just doesn't happen the way people think it will, it wont happen that easily and quick.  
There was huge prediction that housing market as we know it in USA has absolutely collapsed , the house prices are going to crash to absolutely pennies at rock-bottom and markets are going to spin in downward spiral. well, it didn't happen, rich people from china and other rich people in usa are taking advantage, the hole was plugged, it didn't collapse to eternity like predicted.   
Global economy is extremely vast and it will take some huge blow in some form of major raw-material resource crises for some  extreme economic blow-over to happen. from what i am seeing, it just doesnt look like its going to happen for decades now.

lol, its going to stay in nerd stream , until entire market economy as we know it completely collapses, which will take decades.

I want to comment, thanks for not tagging this as NSFW , cause i dont browse reddit in front of my co-workers or childrens, I always do my work when i am at work and i hate to see NSFW tags when i am browsing reddit at my leisure time, I appreciate your efforts to realize there are responsible adults on internet who can handle their shit. we may be very few out there but we are here.

i think bfl just lost tons of money from their account in paypal or got account frozen, all users should simply email them to refund money and link all this stories in email, they should simply refund it in same email. thing is , trusting BFL to refund will be a mistake, its better to simply get refund from paypal as described on varios thread at that bitcoin forum. save yourself from this scam when you can.
