Yeah but that's basically just investing in a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:46:12
I mean it's impossible for average consumers to make any money off of bitcoins, and it was the case even before ASICs
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:52
wow, so why the heck does BTC think it can get away with charging any transaction fee, let alone a $0.40 one?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:16:41
Firstly deflation doesn't mean it's value is high relative to others. It means it increases in value itself.
Secondly money supply != money base. Right now BTC is deflating because velocity is near zero (thanks to ridiculous tx fees) and growth is very high.
If BTC starts plateauing growth then most of the deflationary effects are gone, and then if velocity increases it can and will inflate. 
Note that things like fractional reserve banking are certainly possible with BTC the same as they were with gold standards. The lightning network is even paving the way for people to start working with virtual bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:47:44
If you go to purchase something for $20 and then in the time it takes to get the confirms the BTC is now valued at $30 then you've overpaid by the time steam receives it.
That's what steam was talking about.

It's a problem whenever the end to end transaction is slow. From the user buying the coin with USD (or w/e) to the merchant selling the coin and getting USD (or w/e).
Unless you want to pay 3 transaction fees (1 for the user to buy it, 1 for the coin network, 1 for the merchant to sell it) you need to batch transactions. And when you batch transactions in a volatile system you are going to risk losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:16:50
Yeah but assuming those people are in countries with the lowest cost for power, wouldn't they automatically crowd out anyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:11:11


They don't have free electricity. They have a way of stealing electricity. Utilities included prices don't include commercial uses of electricity. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:17:50
for sure not the bitcoin dedicated ones, but wouldn't you be able to gather a crap ton of graphics cards in a country with very cheap electricity and have it automatically switch to the most profitable algorithm? Then wouldn't the crowd out hobby miners?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:10:12
That's true, it'd get into more complex equations then, like premature lifetime of the card etc.
Also the challenge factors are figured out every 2 weeks or so right? So inter-day demand isn't account for? Like if it's profitable for me to run something overnight but not during the day (thanks to time of use pricing).
I'm kinda curious now, do hashing rates change depending on time of day, or at least the location where the hashing is successful change?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:35:40
It wasn't just too high fees, it was the insane vulnerability as well. Even in the "best case" the fees are entirely too high to process transactions quickly. And if they aren't processed quickly then you risk having to issue refunds or additional payments.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:45:31
Okay [this page]( has some forecasts. Sometime in 2020 or 2021 the reward will be halved. Right now BTC reward is 12.5 and transaction fees seem to be around 1.5-2 as additional reward.
When it drops the reward will be 6.25, so the transaction fees will start making up a sizeable amount of it. It'll be important for a pool to choose the right transactions as doing so will start meaning a huge difference in profit.
But there's a lot more immediate factors at play, this is mostly to keep in mind that today's transaction fees are not representative of a future world on bitcoin where transaction fees must play a much bigger part
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:58:19
They aren't free for merchants, but they at least scale with the cost (which makes it possible to buy a $10 game).
And credit card fees are considered very high by many people, being competitive with them isn't great. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:31:38
When commodity computer speeds get higher than so does the required complexity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:28:42
Especially when you take into account that tx fees are about 20% of the miner profits right now, and once new coin mining goes to 0 the tx fees will need to cover the difference. So unless something changes we're talking 5x the current fees minimum, and even the best examples here x5 are more expensive than the worst credit card fees (except large amounts of money). Even a $2.50 (so a $0.50 fee today) fee makes it unusable for anything less than $50
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:08:11
We're at 16.7 million mined right now. The last 4.3 million will take much longer to mine (perhaps a 100 years?) but the important thing is the reward goes down exponentially as well, which means the fee will go up.
I'll try and see if I can work out the math to forecast the mining rate in a few years
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:06:11
Yep! your right.
But the 2% figure may factor that in. It may not, it depends on the place.
For instance walmart in Canada pays 1.26% for non-reward cards and up to 2.08% for reward cards. Store specific rates generally just means the store increases all prices by that amount (the same way standard credit card fees are worked into the price).
But regardless yes we are talking somewhere in the range of 0.5% to 3%.
I just started to look up debit card fees. I don't know about the US but in Canada it looks like it's a flat rate of about $0.06. Which means bitcoin in these best case examples are almost 10x the cost of debit. And for peer to peer transactions, in Canada they are now free for most accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:08:44
The standard deviation isn't a good measure. That tells you that if you receive regular payments and cash out in bulk then you're normally going to get a 4% difference in money.
But the day to day volatility is important too. Especially if things are automatically paying out. Games sell a huge amount on their release day, and if BTC drops 20% that day (which is entirely normal for bitcoin) then that's 20% less money.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:16:07
Oh yeah I don't mean using nicehash or something. I just mean if it can be discovered what is profitable to mine, why wouldn't a commercial miner just automatically mine that. And once they do why would the situation be any different than with bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:18
I find it hilarious to see that altcoins are trying to go "but we don't have the problems that everybody else has!".
The reason your coin isn't bad yet is because it hasn't scaled yet. Full decentralization is an O(n^2) problem. Unless your altcoin isn't decentralized it isn't avoiding these problems. And if it's centralized, well then what's the point?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:17
the difference is that with mining a profitable coin you're hoping that a price and difficulty level stays consistent (or above a certain threshold). With buying coins you're hoping that the price goes up
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:44:56
false. Server farms electricity consumption doesn't grow linearly with processor count.
And even in a simple user case, a 2nd graphics card means less electricity because they share the same CPU and motherboard and peripherals
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:47:46
If it selected the most profitable one for you and paid you in BTC why wouldn't there be commercial miners that do the same thing?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:57:06
5 cents would have been a reasonable target 5 years ago maybe. Nowadays when places are starting to get free P2P transfers it doesn't have a hope.
The advantages that remain are it's pseudo-anonymity, but in order to retain real anonymity you'd have to do many transfers on top of it, or never have it linked to your actual thing in any way (count on all the people who you buy bitcoin from to never disclose it, and warrants never being issued). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:50:24
well the rewards cards usually just pass on the higher fees to the merchant.
But yes that's a good point that shows that being anywhere near the same price as a credit card fee is absolutely ridiculous if you think that's good. A new payment system needs to have substantially lower fees.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:59:22
So Bitcoin does not allow any form of investment? Ie if the economy was based on bitcoin I'd be screwed if I didn't already have money? (wouldn't be able to afford school, or a house, both loans that are smart consumer can pay back easily, and without cost the consumer a LOT of money).
And another huge area for banks is mutual funds and stocks, where investors definitely make a bunch of money (just at a higher risk).
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:32:01
Yeah I wonder what the effects of this will be. Without a required reserve ratio, the minimum reserve ratio is essentially 0%, which means theoretically unlimited money supply. I know for one the Bank Of Canada requires 2% reserve ratio, which means there is 50 times more money than actually exists (because the money you have in your account doesn't physically exist, but it still can be used just like any money).
I know central banks use the reserve ratio to control money supply, and one of bitcoins major points was supposed to be a very controlled money supply (as in it can never exceed a certain value). A bank can multiply the money supply by having not 100% reserve ratio (which means that it can lend out money), and banks need to lend out money, so the reserve ratio will be much lower than 100%, which will increase the amount of bitcoins in existence. This is actually how we could stop the hyperdeflation of the bitcoin that currently exists, but with no limit, it also allows hyperinflation theoretically.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:25:22
Also is it legal? Most countries have very strict policies around lending and borrowing money in order to help prevent people scamming the system.
I'm curious about how it can work in terms of the average joe investing, especially with stocks (this website offers bonds, but I can't find stocks). Traditionally the average joe can't afford to invest in stocks, but it could be very useful for crowd-funding startups.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:57:51
No to having banks? Or no to having any sort of investment? Without investment it's pretty clear the economy would fail to improve.
EDIT: Although I guess with Bitcoin as unstable as it is right now, it discourages investment, which would already be horrible for any real market.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:24:09
Actually I don't think purchasing bitcoins will help stabilize them, because it will raise the exchange ratio, which will signal to others to buy them, raising it more etc, which is why it's currently out of control.
Accepting bitcoins as payment is something that can really help I think, however it is very difficult without having a stable value (otherwise stores must constantly change prices, or risk losing money, or charging too much).
The problem is that the more people adopt bitcoins, the more the price will rise, so quick adoption causes the bitcoin to destabilize (it also causes a bubble of adoption), whereas slow adoption would keep the value relatively stable. 
What's really needed is a mostly closed system that uses bitcoins to trade. Workers that work for bitcoins, products that sell for bitcoins, and consumers that purchase with bitcoins (that are the ones getting paid with them). A cycle like this will help stabilize the bitcoin, because it'll be possible to deal with them without ever having to trade between bitcoins and regular cash. In this regard, I think having a contracting website, such as oDesk, accepting bitcoins could do a LOT towards promoting better adoption, but with a more stable value (it would be less of a bubble, because it'd actually be worth something). Having a major seller also support bitcoins is another good thing, so if Amazon does support bitcoins it'd help them stabilize.
But I'm glad you realize that investments and banks are indeed required someday. I won't be buying into the system during a bubble, so I'll have to wait a bit until it stabilizes a bit more, and has a full market for it.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:59:24
Banks are not irrelevant. Banks provide security to lenders so that lenders can trust that their money will be returned to them (Thanks to insurance, and government central banks).
Yes they are not required, but mutual funds are risks that the average consumer is usually not willing to take, which may mean the average consumer does not invest, which is really bad.
Your statement that the bitcoin does not lose value since it cannot inflate is entirely incorrect First of all, even in the currency is deflating, you lose money by holding onto it, because you could otherwise invest and get interest (so long as real interest &gt; 0, which should happen so long as deflation is predictable). With less people loaning, that in turn means higher interest rates, and higher interest rates mean less people can afford to borrow.
Banks remove the barrier to invest, so that very few dollars do nothing, and they are at work. Even if consumers don't earn as much money as the bank off of investments, it still means reduced interest rates, which means more people can afford to borrow, and things like houses and universities can be paid for.
The 2nd issue with assuming your money can't lose value from holding onto it is by assuming that bitcoins can't undergo inflation, which is fundamentally flawed for multiple reasons. First of all is the obvious yet unlikely one, if less people use it, there are more BTC per person, which causes inflation. Second is that with fractional reserves (which help stimulate economies a LOT, by allowing more money to be lent out) it is possible for money to be created. Since BTC does not prohibit fractional reserve banking in any way (whether the fractional reserve banking is through a bank, or traditional investments, such as mutual funds, or even just stock and bonds) it's possible for more BTC to be created than intended. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:20:34
So what you're suggesting is that banks must impose upon themselves a reserve ratio, and one that is about 83%. I do understand reserves, but I'm saying is with no minimum on reserve ratios it's possible for a bank to create infinite money (stupid of them to do so yes, but still possible).
With your example of 83% reserve ratio, this creates 20% more bitcoins in the economy. Considering how slowly bitcoins actually grow, 20% is a fair amount. Also considering banks actually have something closer to 10% in reserve (as the more they hold in reserve, the less money they make), this would be a 900% increase in bitcoins.
The way to avoid the system collapsing without having 100% reserves is a problem that economists worked on trying to solve after the great depression, and that was the creation of a central bank, which can loan out to the rest of the banks.
The thing is, a bank should never need a super high amount of x-BTC, it should only need a reliable amount of y-BTC from different investors. The more of their own money they must front, the less it makes sense to be a bank (why take someone's money if it doesn't help you? If you only take in 1/5th of the amount of money you have, and lend out 1/6th of the total, it's WAY worse than lending out the amount you already have)
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:11:47
It scares me that interest rates vary from 1% to 7%. Such a wide distribution is a sign up an unstable market.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:44:34
Well just because the value increases doesn't mean you don't need interest. Money neutrality is the concept you're looking for here. Basically inflation vs deflation doesn't matter for money loss, you still lose money by not collecting interest.
But yes I would like to see cloud funding take a much bigger presence, but do remember that someone who dedicates all their time to investing *ideally* (not necessarily) has a better idea of what will work and what won't. If we get a trusted 3rd party to show credibility though, I think it could work, only problem is splitting up the ownership of the company, it'd have to be done sort of like a mutual fund.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:38:32
If there is some assurance of repayment (ie the investor is guaranteed their money + interest), then it becomes a bank, even if there is still some risk (of the bank going out of business for instance).
If it is a bank then the bank must choose a reserve ratio. The average of all reserve ratios in all banks that people deposit their money (including 100% reserve ratio "banks", like people's personal wallet) can be taken, relative to amount in each. The inverse of this is essentially how much money is "created" by banks, ie how much more money is the market vs how much was actually mined. This kinda kills the philosophy of bitcoin that there is a maximum amount of money in the economy.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:09:40
How does bitcoin solve the problem of investment is the question. If you really think that taking out any loans is good for the economy, then prove it, but you'll be fighting against nearly every economist in the world. As a consumer, I'd rather pay 5% interest on a mortgage for a house, than rent for that same house, because with a mortgage I get something out of it (ownership of a house at the end), whereas with renting I am stuck in the same place forever.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:08:16
Yeah I guess BTC make it very easy for tax evasion, which is not good for the economy either. Walter White would probably love BTC, they kinda allow perfect money laundering (so long as they can buy things with BTC)
