Interesting comparison. I didn't know about the poker boom. Thanks.

I agree that it's probably science fiction. But I also think it's entirely possible, for example, that I'll be able to buy an Airstream using BTC or LTC within the next 2-3 years. And that would be pretty sweet.

Well, to be fair silver went from 17 to 44 and then back. So there was a chance to take profits.
But a lot of the gold bugs out there like Peter Schiff are still dismissing cryptos and pushing gold/silver.
Glad to see that Mike is not one of them.

Thanks. Very helpful.

I'm glad to see one of the gold bugs joining the revolution!

If it's not a currency, it can still be money. They are different.
I think you misunderstand scarcity. All cryptos have scarcity built in (as far as I know). Gold and silver are naturally scare.
The USD has no scarcity.
As for transferability -- you're thinking currency rather than money.
Think about people in Syria or Venezuela right now. With Bitcoin, they could conceivably transfer all of their wealth across a border. That's a big deal. Think about large amounts of money rather than small transactions.
No offense, but I don't think you understand fungibility. Play-doh is not fungible. Bitcoin is.
1oz of Mexican gold is the same as 1oz of Canadian gold. They are interchangeable. That's the key with fungibility.

Articles like this encourage me to keep buying. Even people who are supposed to be financial experts still don't get it.

What if that one government is the US? What will that do for all of us hodlers who live here?

Oh, you know...I read something bad about it on the interwebs and got spooked. I think it was on Amazon actually.

Just canceled my Washington Post subscription because of this article. Total propaganda. I expected better from them.

In a word: malfunctions.

I'm curious why you think that using Bitcoin as currency is the only way for it to have utility?
The five properties of money are: scarcity, durability, divisibility, transferability, and fungibility.
Bitcoin has all of that, with some extras, like privacy.
I'm not saying Ethereum isn't a better technology. It is. But Bitcoin has plenty of utility.
