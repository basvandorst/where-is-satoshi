The point is that it is irrational to decide what merits research and how based on the opinion expressed by a random person on the internet.
If one wants to convince people of their opinion, they obviously have an interest in providing evidence and rationally justifying their opinion.
There is no reason to assume that because someone expressed an opinion that they necessarily have an interest in influencing others.

My understanding is that *derived value* is something a customs official calculates on a shipment, and *intrinsic value* is the is the total perceived value including tangible and intangible benefits.
Bitcoin is decentralized in a way which has tangible and/or intangible benefits.

@_date: 2018-01-06 13:49:27
Your understanding of derived value is actually the definition of intrinsic value.
I think you're thinking of intangible value, which is an incorporeal asset like a licence or a patent. Intrinsic value is the "real" value of a thing. For instance, the market value of a bitcoin is $16190.01 right now, but I think that's an undervaluation because I think the intrinsic value is much higher.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:28:36
What is intrinsic value, and what characteristics does a thing need to have in order to have intrinsic value?

There is no rational basis for making that judgement about someone simply based on the fact that they expressed an opinion.
Argument from incredulity. Just because you can only see little purpose in it does not mean there is little purpose in it.

Just because something is subjective does not make it magical.
You might think the market value is too high, making it a good time to sell. I might think the market value is too low, making it a good time to buy. Neither one of us knows the future, we just have our own opinions about the intrinsic value of the thing. They call it "speculation" for a reason.
Anyone who claims to "know" the intrinsic value of a thing is probably trying to sell you that thing. A car salesperson will seem to *know* just how valuable that extended warranty is.

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings by telling you to grow up, but it's my genuine opinion that your comment was childish. I'm sorry if you expect people to lie to you when they think you're being childish, but I won't.


So my username has a gay pun in it, and I asked a question about homophobia... so that's enough information for you to decide that I must be a person who is looking for things to be offended by. That was enough for you to decide that I must crave homophobia and try to bring as much of it into my life.
I'm not offended by your apparent homophobia. I'm sorry that you're offended that a gay person said "homophobia".
I am being perfectly honest. I genuinely believe your earlier comment was childish. I genuinely believe your later comment was homophobic. You aren't going to prove otherwise by continuing this temper tantrum or by bringing up my sexual orientation.

The point is that some people disagree with this. It's ok to believe that BTC is more "genuine" than BCH, or that there is only one true bitcoin. What isn't ok is pretending that there isn't a genuine debate, or that people who disagree with you are necessarily evil and part of a conspiracy to commit fraud and don't have a right to believe or speak their poison corrupted lies, rather than simply accepting that there are people who genuinely believe this thing that you disagree with.
Let me put it this way.
I don't care about celebrity drama. Is bitcoin cash just another version of bitcoin with technical differences? Seems like it. Are litecoin and monero just other versions of bitcoins with technical differences? Seems like it.
I'm going to call them all "bitcoin". I'm going to say "my bitcoins" when I'm referring to my XMR, and my BCH, and my BTC, (but not my IOTA or ETH, obv). To me, it's just like how Australia and Canada have their own version of the dollar, there are different dollars, and there are different bitcoins.
What *actual harm* am I causing, other than offending some people's hipster sensibility?

You are correct. They are not technical issues. They are a matter of economic policy.

In my experience of you, including your latest comment, it seems like you do not have a good attitude toward gay people. It seems like you are unaware of the ways in which your judgements are influenced by homophobia, and that this is probably because you find the idea that such a thing could be possible to be to offensive to think critically about.


So you were being childish, and I told you to grow up. You threw a temper tantrum, during which you brought up my sexual orientation. I, logically and tolerantly, expressed my genuine opinions and tried to engage in rational discourse. 
And you say that I seem like a "little bitch" and you want people to think your judgement isn't based on my sexual orientation.
I think you brought up my sexual orientation because it would give you power over the conversation, and are reacting poorly to that not working out so well for you.

You're talking about 'my business needs low fees'. You're right that a $15 transaction fee isn't convenient for someone who wants to buy coffee, but for some people *it's more money than they make in a month*.
What's the point in challenging our current financial system if only the affluent are able to participate.
BTC needs high fees to be what it is, and we need BTC to be what it is in order for the entire market to function properly. We also need other coins to fill other markets and serve other purposes.
Feelings of loyalty animosity or rivalry should have no place in how you think about economics and markets. If you find yourself a "fan" of a certain economic instrument like a currency, you should give your head a shake and try to find a more objective way to make your decisions. It's completely pointless.

The word bitcoin is not a proper noun and isn't capitalized, in the same way the word dollar isn't. (OED)


Are they deliberately misleading people into thinking it's the "real" bitcoin, or do they genuinely believe that BCH is the "real" bitcoin?


It's because you are making the claim that there is one group of people who have a rightful claim to the word "bitcoin".
You can feel like BTC is the "real" bitcoin, and other people can feel like BCH is the "real" bitcoin, and you are in a no more legitimate position than they are. You and they *simply disagree*.

Do you think that you are a victim because people express this opinion you disagree with?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:22:17


If that's true, then you'll be able to say who exactly has a legal claim to the word, and who exactly is trying to impersonate that entity.
Do you believe that the people who make this wallet are deliberately trying to fool you into buying BCH when you think you're buying BTC? Are they doing so by appropriating a legitimate legally protected trademark? 
Then it's fraud.
Or, is the word "bitcoin" not trademarked and not owned by a private entity? Do the people who make this wallet simply disagree with you about whether the word "bitcoin" is public domain and about whether it should refer colloquially to this or that?
Then, it's just them expressing an opinion you disagree with, and you using a false accusation because you think it helps prove your case.
I personally think "bitcoin" can and should refer to both BTC and BCH.... Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. If you think that belief makes me a fraudster, then I think that accusation makes you a bigot.

No offence taken, and none intended over here as well.
I'm not weighing in on what the real bitcoin is, or what that even means. 
For whatever reason, people on one side of that issue seem to take on the rhetoric of victimhood: that people who believe that BCH is the real bitcoin have no "right" to express that opinion, and are "attacking" bitcoin and committing "fraud" by expressing that opinion.
What I'm trying to figure out is whether the extreme rhetoric is because of paranoia, hyperbole, or if there actually is a conspiracy which isn't apparent.
Some people seem to talk as if the very existence of BCH is crime against them personally. On the surface it seems insane.

My understanding is that a single word with brand identity would be covered under trademark, not copyright.
Bitcoin Core has some sort of legal claim to the word? I wonder what jurisdiction that is in.

Why would anyone object to referring to Bitcoin as "bitcoin core"? I mean... I could see why someone would object to calling bitcoin that, but not Bitcoin.

Those currencies have very small units which result in prices that are large numbers. What we're talking about here as being awkward is the opposite: very large units which result in prices that are very small numbers.
We're not saying it would be awkward to have to pay ten thousand units of something for a coffee. We're saying it would be awkward to have to pay one ten thousandth of one unit of something for a coffee.

Look back in the thread. I already posted a link to a good explanation.
The point is that you can't argue that a word is taking on a definition in an *improper* way if you have no clear concept of what the *proper* way is.

Are businesses afraid to accept cash because it will be worth less in the future?

Guess what? If a significant number of people started calling a pen a “brush”, that new definition of the word would be added to the dictionary.
You should read that article I posted.
Right now, I don’t think you really have an answer to the question, “How do words come to have specific meaning?”
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:36:03
I don't think that's true at all. If a currency had a feature which made it particularly attractive for criminals to use for laundering, it doesn't matter whether it's a cryptocurrency or not. If it's used for laundering, governments and media (rightfully) try to solve that problem.

How do words come to have their specific meanings?

Are you sure you aren’t falling into the trap of making an argument from incredulity?
Like... I can understand the criticism of his art that the meaning behind it is too superficial pedestrian simple and obvious, but to say you can’t find any meaning in it doesn’t make any sense to me.

That's idiotic.
Trying to convince people to call bitcoin cash something other than "bitcoin cash" is idiotic.

Am I missing something? She knows what she’s talking about, but doesn’t she mean “tangible value”?

He always leaves out the selling fake documents money laundering and peddling contracts to commit murder.
The movement to end drug prohibition doesn’t need spokespeople like him.

Vaseline wasn't designed for lubrication. Just because a thing is designed for one purpose does not mean other purposes are invalid.


Where did Satoshi state that only Satoshi's aims and beliefs are important?
Where did Satoshi claim to be a prophet?

If you were aware of it and allowed it to happen, yes.
Even more so if you encouraged it or took steps to facilitate it.
