You're making a valid point. However, it relies heavily on this point


They, 


don't "demand" anything. Your post makes sense from the eyes of a Democratically governed society. Talk to your city councilor, call your state representative, organize a rally.
Now think about what recourse a Chinese citizen has in the realm of Public Infrastructure. Your grid is owned and operated by the Provincial Government. Smaller county-run agencies handle most of the local administrative work (dealing with end users, handling small maintenance and interruptions). Rates are set behind closed doors. 


This is accurate as a general statement. However, to attribute this change to 1) Public outcry or 2) transitioning into a consumer market (as the OP stated) is misguided. The government will continue to dictate rates on utilities as it sees fit, just as it does with lending, the national currency and anything else it wants to.
The point as it relates to the topic in the article is, until the government's hammer drops, nothing will change with the mining of BTC in China.
