Yes. Delete post, delete profile and create a throwaway account, the ask again without the amount! :)

Believe that a seed word corresponds with a part of the private key. Each word completes the private key and in the right order “decodes” your private key in full that matches the public key. 
E.g elaborate enigma that uses a key. The correct key unlocks the message. The wrong key gives you garbage…
It uses BIP39 (mnemonic).

I believe so. As the seed is in a certain order the matching algorithm will decode it. 
I’ve asked something similar in a previous post about ledger. And you can decode it anywhere using BIPS.

Haha ok :)
Well you always could buy those timelock jars/ safes that open after certain amount.

If you lost the windowapassword there is a “hack” that allows you to reset the local account. See url below. 
If it’s encrypted with eg bitlocker then it’s nearly impossible to do. 
Edit: what you also could do/ try is to attach a converter to usb on the disk and connect it with your current computer. Then navigate to your old account where you’d stored your wallet an copy it to your new pc. Then copy it again to an usb for safekeeping and try to recover the coins. 
And yes! Delete this post and never use your account ever again!!!

What? Do you mean exchange it to your preferred currency and then transfer it to your bank. 
Or do you mean “store” it in your bankaccount? If yes, then no.

You could place it under care of a notary that releases/ executes the will after certain time. 
Ps: do not share an amount of coins you have online ;)
