Yup, as of right now I've been waiting a week with nothing but a canned response even after asking for a refund. The service is a hassle and I wouldn't touch it unless you absolutely have to. I got verified by my gox in the time it's taken to get this ridiculous transfer resolved. Not too mention missing out on the drop on the market.

It has now been 3 weeks for me with no reconciliation on Bitinstants part, no response except for a canned email, and no assurances I will get my money transferred. Sadly, I don't even know how to vent my anger as nobody will respond to my emails. It's all gotten out of hand. Don't ever use this server. EVER.

Thanks, that was extremely frustrating but I appreciate it. Frustrating

I am having this issue now as well. It's been 1 week+ and have yet to get anything but a canned response even after asking for a refund. It's a shit service and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I'm really confused about a BitCoin crash and what it would look like. It's not a stock... It's hard for people to make a run on the market. Because of the current short supply and short supply in the future, what is the catalyst that causes a run on the bank so intense that it would drop the price? Especially considering the current group of hoarders it seems most wouldn't take the loss and just hold on?

I saw success stories and tried it myself and got burned so far. What service did you use to transfer? I used dwolla, thought that might be the case but bitinstant had no problem taking the money immediately.
