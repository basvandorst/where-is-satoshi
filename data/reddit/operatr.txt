Agreed, without a mining-like incentive to do so, really only the largest pools would run a node simply because the pool software requires it for direct network communications.
Ideally something like P2Pool should be side-chained or merge mined with Bitcoin in the future to monetize the nodes, killing two birds with one stone. Providing distributed pool nodes can then be separated into its own respective type of Bitcoin support business, similar to how mining is an incentive network service to verify transactions.  
This is still a young technology however with realistically few users, and even fewer that actually maintain the global network. The first players to enter the fray are naturally the biggest. I think further developments with sidechaining and other enhancements built on top of Bitcoin will solve these problems over time.

I really don't see how anyone can claim Bitcoin is so erratic and then go look at the "real world" stock markets and other instruments and assets that are just as bad if not worse, and often highly manipulated all the same. 
The Bitcoin ecosystem (that's including its offspring currencies) is still very young, but stability will come with time.
That said, fiat price is very, very poor indicator of Bitcoin's overall health.

I can't wait to see how they handle systems like Ethereum in light of this.

As long as Bitcoin is dependent on centralized electricity and Internet to function, no it most certainly is not decentralized.
It is fundamentally, but not actually, not yet anyway. Though I think the next generation of systems like Ethereum will enable us to decentralize pretty much anything that is a valuable resource to help with this. This will take a long time to implement though.

I'd let them rent your space for a flat fee plus some commission percentage on traffic. Consider it no different than any other vending machine, because by and large that's what a Bitcoin ATM is assuming it isn't a two-way exchange type. 
You are not liable to service it, just to keep it powered and accessible during business hours per whatever contract you draw up. 
You might do better than you think, if you are the only ATM in the area, it could become a strategic spot where there was none before. Coiners follow the coin I suppose :)
If you become comfortable at some point, accepting BTC for your services would be a perfect coupling, and run discounts for buying with BTC to add some incentive to your customers to try it out.

Things like Ethereum, Mastercoin, Bitshares, Nextcoin and other decentralized exchange projects will be the end of such problems. The blockchain doesn't let you cheat.
Central exchanges have proven quite vulnerable, and also completely screw with the markets when they go offline. With allegations that some Chinese exchanges are faking data, it is clear this is a serious problem, but one that is already being addressed by the next stage of Bitcoin technology.

Except you can't typically buy alpaca socks with any other capital asset directly.

Big banks launder money practically unrestricted for large drug cartels. Whatever fines they get for it is just a cost of doing business.
The hipocracy of FinCEN and other regulatory bodies is unparalleled. Bitcoin represents a direct threat to their financial monopoly, and the money laundering angle is one of the few weapons at their disposal against it.
Ultimately it won't matter I think. Blockchains will simply phase the government's involvement with finance out.

I've heard of a few that actually do have discounted rates if paying in Bitcoin, because they don't have so much expense in taking your Bitcoin payment compared to a credit card. 
If you've ever seen a $5.00 minimum at stores for credit card transactions, the reason is under that amount and the fees for running your card cuts into their bottom line considerably. Things can be cheaper as merchants don't have to factor in the fees as Bitcoin's are negligible.

I don't think the IRS has any expectation of anyone to report every nickle spent, the guidance is more for businesses and investors if anything to report large capital gains. The IRS simply doesn't have the resources to keep track of literally every transaction.
Unless you're buying a Lamborghini with your Bitcoin earnings probably don't worry about it too much. 
That said, I'm not paying simply because I think the IRS is an unconstitutional institution that only collects taxes to service the national debt and gives absolutely nothing back of value at all.

So, in fact the entirely of government is tied to the banks in an unholy union that serves the rich bankers. A government is more or less just the military arm of bankers.

It does have a certain crypto-anarchist ring to it that is endearing to me personally and *cool*, which is why it changed I suspect. 
The larger public has associated "dark" anything to do with technology as anti-government/drugs/black market etc exactly because such services are usually called DarkSomething or being in a "dark" or black market, not exactly the image they wanted to convey.
OpenBazzar sounds much more friendly and non-threatening, free of any negative connotations because of things like Silk Road.

Though with 3-4 large players, every time any of them increase their own network it screws the profit margin for all of them. At some point the incentive to add any more vanishes. 
Their datacenters can only handle so much as well before needing more custom facilities, which is a lot of expense to build more mega-mines that just degrades their own revenues. Though most make it up by selling some of their miners too.

What a nonsensical mess of a post.
There will never be a period where EVERYONE holds. There are buyers, and sellers, and always will be. Sellers will sell at a price that satisfies them to buyers willing to pay that price. That is how exchanges work.
It is purchased by greedy traders, Bitcoin true believers, and everything inbetween for a variety of reasons. 
If you look at a log chart of Bitcoin price, there is always a rundown like this after a big run up, and we're getting close to the end of this cycle. This doesn't scare any Bitcoin veteran, its just a good time to buy from weak hands. These periods are also always followed up by FUDsters like yourself who spout off a bunch of ill researched crap calling the end of Bitcoin.
How can you say no one is interested in goods and services bought with Bitcoin? Bitpay's 100,000 merchants would disagree with you. Overstock.com is doing some pretty good business since accepting it. 
Truth is you cannot predict the future any better than anyone else can, nor do you see the bigger picture here with blockchain technology as a whole and what it will do for us as a society.

There is always one thing people crying about how CEX.io is unprofitable seem to forget:
Profit is in *trading* hashpower, not buying and holding a static amount of hashpower for a dividend. 
If you just buy CEX shares, then no, your investment probably won't return what you put in. If you trade them however like any other commodity, you can potentially clean house if you know what you are doing. 
I however don't support them as CEX.IO/GHASH.IO are ridiculously large and centralized, which is not good for Bitcoin.

I predict as the fiat monetary system breaks down Bitcoin will be there to absorb the damage as faith in fiats craters and people want another option. This is the option we never had before as a society.
With proper tax guidance traditional investors are getting in, and when their fiat asset portfolios burn down, they will be the first ones looking for the exit.

Thanks for this OP. The one missing thing I find with many Bitcoin opponents and naysayers is a complete lack of understanding that our current economic model is grossly distorted now through limitless money creation, insane self-serving financial policy, outright criminalism that wouldn't be out of place for a Mexican drug cartel and too few people at the top controlling it all without the consent of anyone else. There is no free market of any kind as long as all of this remains true.
Bitcoin is the answer. It solves a problem that we've never been able to solve before in finance. Typically when a fiat dies, it is replaced with another fiat that ends up in the same catastrophic decline eventually. No fiat currency created on this planet has surived long term, for a failure rate of 100% (including the soon to be failure of the Dollar, Pound, Euro, and the rest globally). 
The Dollar has declined 98% since 1913. Bitcoin's value went up over 2000% last year alone. Which of these do you think has a future?

Only if you are not a student of financial history and keeping up with times today. These are simple facts. 
This has been the banking gambit since ancient times. Wealthy families/banks would fund wars of the state (because war is crazy expensive), in return for the state bowing down to their wishes. It is just as true today as it ever was. 
Inflation is the silent tax that no one realizes they pay, fed the standard "inflation is good for the economy" trope without any actual rationalization behind it. 
In a Bitcoin world, war would only be funded directly by the public, willingly. Governments cannot simply create more money out of nowhere to pay for war, they must keep to an actual budget. Government actions would be more like Kickstarter campaigns on national projects and interests. I imagine if the cost of war came directly from your pocket, there would be virtually no war, and if there were they would be incredibly short lived. 
War is only good for banks and the gun makers. It is their incentive to start wars, and then fund wars, because either way, they win, and every commoner loses.

Fiat currency has become more like a bad crack addiction for Wall Street (on top of their very real coke addictions), and the mass populace is its unwilling dealer.

Now we are at the point where they need a big money injection every day to stay "normal" thanks to reckless Federal Reserve policies that can't solve the underlying addiction, and more and more will be needed with time to maintain a completely out of control (and completely fake) stock market.

Gold is not the same. Gold is not an autonomous payment service as well as a currency. Bitcoin is more like a corporation really. Gold is just metal that is mined from the ground, which is by and large only a speculative asset and nothing more beyond some industrial uses.
Bitcoin is used as currency far more than gold is in the world. Sticking fiat property rules on an asset like digital currencies that function as currency, money, stocks, and assets is effectively only regulating a portion of its functionality. 
By the same token Bitcoin is just simply a currency per FinCENs guidance either.
I'm not surprised by these schizophrenic moves by the Treasury, as Bitcoin simply doesn't fit within their established rules.

It is never too early to invest in something, at your age I would highly recommend it. I always wished that I had done something like that back then.

By the time you are legally an adult you might be sitting on a small or even large fortune. It won't happen overnight, but investing requires patience. 
Your future 21 year old self may be very glad you invested into it instead of something frivolous and throw-away. Even buying just a little Bitcoin today might have a profound effect on your life as they mature over the next few years.

Short term at the moment is brutal, but this is the natural result of Bitcoin starting to interact with a larger world, and the world is reacting. 
There is still vast immaturity in this technology, but let's keep in mind that Bitcoin-d itself (or Bitcoin Core now) is still a Beta release. 
I too look far beyond the market price today, as it really doesn't indicate much more than investor sentiment. I see tons of money being thrown in from venture capitalists and large investors, crazy amounts of development from the community that is only growing, and a lot of spin-off projects now in the works.
A lot of people didn't believe in the Internet in 1995 either. They said it would never be important, couldn't see how it would change business and commerce, never appreciated it's innovation or the new possibilities. Now the Internet literally touches everything you do. Blockchain technology is in this period with the same kind of naysayers, panickers, and doubters. All the same, there are also investors and visionaries bringing this to life.
Let the naysayers nay and the weak hands sell, I know this is incredibly important and possibly the greatest revolution of our time. Ill be soaking up Bitcoin while it is still cheap, because someday the greater populace will soon wonder what they ever did without Bitcoin.

I would say it's a non problem, and the reason being we can all simply choose something else, or start something else. Bitcointalk and this sub were simply the first around, naturally they are the largest.
But I do think Theymos and the other mods are greasy, seemingly sitting on $4 Million in Bitcoin that was supposed to become a new forum that never materialized. Bitcointalk itself has become a cesspool of incessant noobery that is barely moderated, and also rife with scammers (who Theymos lets advertise there). I've all but abandoned it and have been working on building up my own community anyway. 
I actually tried to voice my concerns with the Mining section of Bitcointalk being such a colossal mess, and the mods basically just made fun of me and said stop complaining, despite the message itself not being vindictive or assholey (even had a few polite suggestions on what could be done). So, I could care less to see it die.

As did I a while ago. Not a one of the alts really is anywhere close to BTC in terms of volume or market cap, and the ones that actually have cool features will eventually end up in Bitcoin.
At a point there seemed to be 10 new ones every day ripe for a pump and dump. It is simply fatiguing to be in the altcoin market trying to keep track of them all. It can also be dangerous, in the case of the ContinuumCoin I mined and got stuck with because there was not a one buy order found anywhere. 
As much as I like DarkCoin for example, there is nothing stopping Bitcoin devs from implementing CoinJoin as a standard element in Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin has millions of dollars in VC capital and big investors coming in. Does PotCoin? Hell no. 
I believe that network effect will see the vast majority of altcoins shoved out the door.

The inevitable next stage to decentralize the exchanges is already underway (Ethereum, Mastercoin, Bitshares, others), by the end of 2014 I suspect these problems will be a faded memory. 
Third parties cannot be 100% trusted. Not now. Not ever. We cannot really call Bitcoin decentralized as long as it is operating on mostly centralized infrastructure (private mines, private exchanges, private Internet, private electricity). These things have to change around it too. 
BTC-e at least has a decent track record compared to eMpTy.Gox, I had never had any issues using it, though certainly do not trust it to hold my coins long term. Any time I traded I accepted that coin was already lost forever.

This is most of it I think. People tend to attack what they don't understand and is different than the norm they are used to, which is called normalcy bias.

I think the real problem is bitcoin actually isn't a currency. It isnt a stock, or an asset either.
Bitcoin is a unique financial instrument that no singular normal classification covers, because it functions like all three (cash, stocks, assets). The IRS is attempting to apply fiat rules to Bitcoin, and in this they will ultimately fail at a fundamental level. Realistically the only thing they can do is tax the fringe at fiat exchanges. In this I can see, taxes applying if one purchased Bitcoin at some value, sat on it until the price went up, and sold back to fiat with a gain. Or as a miner, selling your mined coins for fiat. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:50:58

The problem is the crypto-stocks market is currently in the amateur hour stage, not unlike Mt.Gox when it first started trading. These are also centralized adding another hazard. After watching so many exchanges vanish lately with people's coin I'm very hesitant to use them.
I think the advent of Mastercoin, Ethereum, and others this year will fix this by decentralizing asset exchange over these scammy/unreliable first generation exchanges.

This closed source attitude will not serve them well into the future. They are clinging to what worked for them in the past, but it won't now as everything around them becomes open source.
They already tried didn't they? Or is this part of the same system? Regardless, it seems like a fancy coupon system, not a cryptocurrency at all. 
If they were smart they would launch an actual open cryptocurrency network of their own, and accept it for their wares.  Or just stop trying to control everything and accept Bitcoin as a supporter instead of fighting it.

Bitcoin can't operate without infrastructure. Large investments into startups is a sign that big money is moving ahead despite the risks or volatility. Fiat whales don't usually back these kinds of things with hundreds of millions of dollars if they don't think it's going to pan out long term. I'd say its a sign of confidence in Bitcoin, which overall is great.

Just show him the many examples right here on Reddit of small businesses accepting BTC to great affect. It is a way to tap into a totally new market.
There are challenges, and no need to gussy them up either. Bitcoin is still very young (still beta!), and being an early adopter can be risky, but that risk can be mitigated more or less.
Just check with your bank first about their policies with Bitcoin.

However, these things come naturally, eventually someone will coin (ahem) a term that will stick when its really needed.

As I have always said, BTC fiat price is one of the worst indicators of Bitcoin's health.  
I see massive development efforts, new amazing tools, many big names accepting it as a payment option for their wares, surging adoption by small businesses eager to remove their parasitic payment processors, and fantastic communities of forward thinking people being built. I see millions of dollars being pumped into it by VC firms to create more of the same. This technology is not going anywhere but up and beyond. 
Open Transactions along with Mastercoin, ColoredCoins, BitShares, and Ethereum will end this kind of debacle once and for all, taking private (untrustworthy) exchanges out of the equation.

Entirely wrong. The global banking system is fundamentally unsound and in the control of a very small and wealthy few. The monetary system only perpetually creates debt (and causes human misery on a massive scale), and is mathematically guaranteed to fail, as every single fiat currency on this planet ever has.

Taxes don't even pay for that. Taxes pay off interest from the money the US Government "borrows" from the FED (keep in mind the FED creates Dollars out of thin air daily). The IRS was put in place right along side the FED for exactly this purpose. 
Sometime soon this interest will exceed our ability to pay for it with these taxes on the public. Fractional reserve banking effectivley only creates more debt, on which the interest payments are increasing as well. 
War is funded by the FEDs money printing, which in turn the Government funds the military though a bunch of back ally deals with arms manufacturers and other agents of the war machine.

It's not even so much about refusing to adopt a feature, as those features simply can't be implemented as it stands. Bitcoin's abilities outside of being a basic currency are limited. Colored Coins for example has a nice idea, but comes with several significant problems that can't be solved without radically changing Bitcoin.
Take Ethereum, for example, as an "altcoin". This is being built from the ground up to use a blockchain to enable intelligent contracts and autonomous agents, using its own programming language. This will take the Colored Coins idea far beyond what Bitcoin itself is capable of. In this, I see much promise for Ethereum's currency, called Ether. 
These specialized alts will survive as they are solving a problem that Bitcoin can't. Pure clones have little value because fundamentally they don't do anything different than Bitcoin as a basic wealth transmission service.

Bitcoin is designed to be inflationary at first to issue coins, however the rate at which coins are created decreases over time to zero. After that no more coins are created forever, and is truly deflationary.

Basically in theory, you could create a smart contract sidechain that would let you transmute Bitcoin into a Bitcoin backed security, always redeemable for Bitcoin. 
This extends Bitcoin into being a true base currency with higher level services that use their own chains but mined though the existing network. 
Think of Bitcoin in this instance as TCP/IP like the base communication protocol for the Internet. Sidechains would allow an HTML-like layer on top of Bitcoin as monetized distributed applications.

Every day I hear about another business accepting Bitcoin, which is great. 
Small business has a big incentive to hop on board in the face of crushing taxes, un-affordable employee healthcare, and ridiculous banking and transaction fees. And the entire system is just slow, what takes fiat 3 days to do, Bitcoin does in 10 minutes for a minuscule fee. 
 America itself has become very hostile to small business in past years increasingly creating laws that benefit large corporations that end up driving small owners out of their community. 
Plus Bitcoin is 100% free to start using and accepting. A credit card processor charges a large monthly fee, a percentage of the sale, and more fees, just to be a part of the economy.

I'm in it because our world needs a fundamental change in our monetary system so that everyone has an equal chance to participate and prosper on their skills and merits. 
The fiat system is fundamentally flawed and now completely corrupt by those at the top of global banking institutions with a long history of collusion and economic fascism. This has led in the end to a 100 year period of unparalleled human misery as the wealth flows to the top, as evident by the millions now jobless, hopeless, and broke. This is now happening on a global scale for the first time in our history. Every fiat currency ever created has failed, and the Dollar, Euro, and others are no different in this. Every graph I see of the fiat economy points to everything falling apart drastically as the worldwide credit bubble pops. It should be evident to anyone with a functioning brain that this will not end well. The next stock market crash will make 2008 look like nothing. 
The greed and hubris of Wall Street is bringing this chapter of finance to a fiery close. Usually the "solution" is that global banks just create another centrally controlled fiat currency and the cycle repeats all over again. We have an option with Bitcoin now that we never had before to create a fair economy for all with a new kind of financial model in the form of monetized distributed applications that place innovation over profit at any cost that has damaged our world badly.

I've been very pleased with their service over the last several months. The site is really nice and easy to use, never had one problem buying or selling coins.

I'd say the it even goes beyond the blockchain-
Satoshi figured out how to *monetize* open source with a secure open source transaction system, which is beyond huge. 
Autonomous Internet corporations will replace everything from banking to manufacturing in a decentralized world, with blockchains linking them all together financially as a method of commerce. I for one can't wait to see where this all goes.

Krugman is a corporatist shill who knows nothing of Bitcoin or actual economics.

Paypal would be very wise to turn itself into a Bitcoin service or be forgotten and buried.
Paypal is: slow, insecure, expensive
Bitcoin is: fast, secure, and cheap 
Which one do you think people will use if there is a choice...

Not all of us have the option to leave. 
Not that we should be forced to by this kind of overreaching crap from regulatory bodies comprised of liars and thieves who just want their piece.
America is my home, the Internet is my state, Bitcoin is my currency, they are the invaders that must be eliminated.

It is run by a convicted scammer (Sonny), and an asshole (Josh Zerlan), what do you expect?
With so many choices of miner these days there is no excuse to keep giving money to these liars and thieves.

There is a biiiiig difference between a pure speculative asset bubble and the adoption of a new technology. 
Fools don't know anything, its time to take uneducated Bitcoin pundits seriously as FUD generators.

Namecoin is a good idea, but needs serious development help. .Bit has practically zero support under it at all, seems the devs are mostly aloof. 
The QT client needs to be merged with a web server like apache or ngix to also decentralize that part. The main problem I had in trying to set up a .bit domain is that there are simply not really any webservers within the namespace. I was able to get a site up through proxying to my normal web host, but that kind of defeats the point of decentralized Internet.

99% of the population doesn't seem to understand how close the fiat money system is to a total meltdown either. Ignorance is bliss I suppose

I envision a Bitcoin government would have to crowd-source for its initiatives and projects, and be responsible for the funds, just like a startup-company. We get a direct vote on how much funding we collectively decide to put into it. 
Do you think war would ever happen if it was really up to the citizens of that country to crowd-fund tanks and drones? Don't think so.

We need a new word for what bitcoin is.
It functions as currency, money, and stock-like asset, therefore cannot be fully classified as any one of those.
None of those financial classes have their very own open-source global transfer system under them either.

Can't say anything bad that Bitpay and Coinbase are encouraging businesses (and even musicians) to start using Bitcoin. Not all they approach will be quite so enlightened, at least for now.

Well said. Overall Peter Schiff seems to know his stuff in the fiat world, but that said it is clear he thinks with a fiat mind when it comes to Bitcoin. 
It is a great point to make that Bitcoin is not so much the Bitcoins themselves as the usability and freedom of the payment network they ride around on. This is something I will include in my explanations to new people. 
Its not money, or currency, but something else new entirely.

This FED?  
Sounds like they are plenty busy destroying the fiat economy and the societies attached to it to worry about little ol' Bitcoin much.
So much the better, I hope they keep ignoring Bitcoin until they suddenly find themselves out of a job.

This is why Bitcoin will eventually be a big hit everywhere. 
Banks and governments will keep taking their slice any way they can just to use your own money. And they have the audacity to tax you on top of it...

Won't work. And how is changing Bitcoin's default value beneficial that completely forces everyone to relearn how Bitcoin works?
The easy solution is to simply give 1 mBTC a denomination just like Satoshis. People are already used to denominated fiat money, the way $1 is in fact 100 cents. 1 Bitcoin can now be 1000 smaller units in general usage.

This debacle only shows that traditional fiat systems are not any safer than a shady Bitcoin exchange. And this is the case for the same reason: piss-poor operational security that hackers exploit. It also highlights the fallacy of centralized systems.
Bitcoin is still way safer than a credit card in terms of transaction security.
