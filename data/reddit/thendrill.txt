No, you don't understand. 
Throwing money at something and screaming innovation, does nothing. Except for the person laughing and collecting your money. 
You have to understand that bitcoin is not a technical miracle. Bitcoin might live, Bitcoin might die. Someone investing their life savings in that is just stupid. 
The technical miracle is the blockchain, bitcoin is not the blockchain.

No one is trying to "stifle its adoption" ... They just want their share of the cake... In this cake that share will be around x.xx % that they will determine when they find out how to do it. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:34:30
That is not true... There are other mining algorythms... And we dont need to pay for PoW, we can pay per share of contributed work.

Well... everyone is treating BTC as a stock. therefore market cap is valid. 
We have no better way of evaluating it anyway. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:30:54
Yes but if you look in other threads where "Why should I use bitcoin instead of X?" is asked, they all point out how good they feel "not sharing" personal information. And how decentralized it is... 
I truly believe that that bitcoin is the myspace of the facebook that is going to come around, all thanks to the blockchain.

Do you have any better way of relating to the total worth of bitcoin  ? Coz I am sorry MuForceShoelce... We didn't realize that "market cap" was a delusional nonsense, FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS... but thanx for pointing that out... I have Dow Jones here on the phone waiting for you to tell us what to use instead.

I use BTC to by stuff from humble bundle, the store accepts them too, and usually its cheaper than buying directly from steam 
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:53:51
The wallet is essentially a BTC  p2p  node. So even when it is not syncing it is still a part of the network and is processing and validating transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:18:47


Yehhh.... We are not there yet !

They coins are not "lost" as in not in circulation. 
They are "lost" as in lost from the hands of the rightful owners. So in fact the coins are not LOST they are STOLEN.

It should be up to the people to make the choice to switch. Not an incentive from a btc whale that is looking for entertainment

Soo... People in the US should kill the bankers for messing up ?
If someone has invested their : "life savings" or "jobs" based on Bitcoin... Well That is their fault. ! 
Remember... Business is Business.... For someone to win... someone has to lose...

If P = NP, then the least of our problems is bitcoin. But I think that the PoW in bitcoin can be easily exchanged.... 
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:09:16
The inherent problem of the bitcoin p2p protocol is that if a node has 51% or more of the computing power of the total mining network then it can generate pay transactions without actually them being valid but if 51% of the network says they are valid the rest of the network will validate them. 
In simple terms. If a pool has 51% or more of the hashing power then it can generate unlimited amount of coins. That would void the whole point of bitcoin, people will lose faith in bitcoin and the price is going to go down down down.... 
So that is why in every miners interest for that not to happen. When a pool reaches 51% people will move away from that pool to keep the security of the network and coin price.

Hmmm.... Lets think about other "human rights" that we don't have to ask permission for: 
1- Sex... Yep that is regulated... You can't sell that... 
2- Peeing... Ohh yeh.. You can't pee in public... 
3- Having plants... Yeh you can can have them, EXCEPT the ones that the government says u can't. 
Do I need to go on..... People do what the government says they do. If the government decides to tax bitcoin and register it, they will make sure they do it. The ones that dont will be stuck with worthless bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:11:24
A nice very nice piece of work... But except the B on the coins how does this relate to bitcoins ?
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:04:06

What is the price for these ? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:52:12
Yes but the main flaws of bitcoins are also what people point out as strengths. The general population wants, security, insurance and to have to hold someone accountable, ESPECIALLY when it comes to money. 
The problem with bitcoin is that now when someone is screaming in the crowd, " X btc is gone from my wallet !!! " . The crowd says.. "Did u have it encrypted? Ohh You did ! Well.. tough luck... Move on bro. "   
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:58:23

Honestly if you think about the main reason for fiat over btc, is exactly the whole government control thing. 
I am speaking about Norway now, and I believe other governments have  the same securities. 
In short, the money you have in a bank is being kept safe and is guaranteed that will not evaporate, as long as the government has money.
For me BTC is more like a service than an actual currency

BitCoin is great, if you have a good understanding of technology and computers. 
But for the average household bitcoin is VERY non prpactical.  
Just imagine internet 1996. It is exactly where bitcoin is now.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 13:15:36
Here is the catch... Your bank will give the money to your familiy AFTER it has deducted anything you ow them. 
If you die and ur familiy has access to your bitcoin, then it is their bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:12:06
I really like the general community delusion, of "anonymity" and "being decentralized" .... 
I mean lets face it, bitcoin is still not big enough to bother anyone. 
Let us put some numbers in perspective. Current market cap of 
BTC: **8 billion USD**
That is: 
Less than **HALF** of what facebook payed for Whats app. 
About **ONE THENTH** of Bill Gates net worth.
If Bitcoin was a fortune 500 company it would be somewhere around 330 right next to Becton Dickinson and Sealed Air. 
All this just points out that bitcoin is not big enough and if it ever goes big. Mr. Government will come down hard on it. Like it or not. The only way people will be able to cash out their BTC, is shown on the video. Merchants will not be allowed to sell for BTC unless taxed.

I dont think you understand how real world works ! 
If you have a full time job u still need a place to live. So u need to pay rent. Lets say u make 2000 USD a month. U still need to pay at least half for rent and utilities, that is 1000 USD. The rest u have to live on and pay all ur other bills, cars, food, medical etc. 
 
If you go to a bank today to buy a house u might need to pay off lets say 1200 USD a month and after 20 years u own the house. after u pay off the loan. U can not pay rent have a nice place AND save for a house.... What happens after 5 years when u have a wife and kid. U still gonna live in a crappy place to "save" money so u can retire and buy a house ??? 
There is a reason why we have banks and why we need banks.
