The point is that the government can't tax my bitcoins.

^ This. ^ 
Bitcoin was created as a tool for individuals to protect themselves from banks and governments.

I don't own land and never will. Me and my bitcoins are good to go. : )

I empathize with all that are caught up in this mess. But people new to Bitcoin (the past two or three months) need to learn that exchanges can't be trusted to hold cash or bitcoins for extended periods. 
This is how you learn. It's how I learned too.

Which is why I stay in Bitcoin as much as possible.

Other statists.
I'm aware of the bigger picture. My stake in Bitcoin is larger than average. I'm a  buy and holder and have been for two years.
The bigger picture is that Bitcoin is the end of the Hegelian nation state. I have no interest in working with an entity - the State - that will have decreased influence in five years if I can maximize my profit now by ignoring it for as long as possible.

Even Bloomberg reported on it, when Bitcoin was at ~$20. If the banks were worried at $20, maybe they're a little more worried at $100:




BTW, they shut down a $20 million currency with extreme prejudice. Google "Liberty Dollar".

The original point is that Bitcoin's existence threatens the reputation of central banks. Even central banks admit it.

With the existence of Bitcoin, death is now the only certain thing.

Help change the system by continuing to pay taxes to a predatory entity?
This is your idea of logic?

How about you stop with the "gotta be legit" brownnosing. Bitcoin is already legit. Banks and governments are the dishonest and illegitimate players in this game.
Avoiding excessive and unjust taxes is desired by every human being alive. Bitcoin brings this desire closer to possibility.

Tell me something: what's "normal" about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:35:15
We survive, just like Bitcoin. ; )

Graet is one of the best humans that ever mined a bitcoin. This sucks.

"Cyberthugs put YOUR PC to work as Bitcoin-mining SLAVE"
At least you can turn your computer off. 
The Fiat Thugs keep you slaving 24/7 with no choice to opt out of their ponzi scheme.

The Federal Reserve, the ECB and all central banks want Bitcoin gone or discredited. Every day that Bitcoin exists and holds or gains price makes them look a little more ridiculous.

They were told by an agent of the USG that it was legal.
The Fed didn't like so who cares what the USG says?
