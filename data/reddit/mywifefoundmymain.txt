Or you know the exchanges just “lose them”

To make cheese you heat it and then add combinations of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (with occasionally other starter bacteria) and then you ferment it. 
To make cheese you heat milk then add Lactobacillus bulgaricus OR Streptococcus thermopiles. Next (the defining difference) you add rennet. 
But saying yogurt isn’t cheese is like saying kerosene and gasoline aren’t related. Slightly different processes yield different results. 
There’s more to it than just adding rennet, like watching the ph etc. but I’ll give you a good example of how closely related they are. 
When we make yogurt we cut half of it out and strain it to make Greek yogurt. Then we split the Greek yogurt in half and strain that half under pressure for 24 hours longer to make cream cheese. 
Yes there are other ways but this is actually the easiest way.

Ummmm... no it doesn’t it has curds and whey

Depends on your type of cheese. For example ricotta is something like 50% whey. The general rule is the less dry a cheese is the more whey it has. 
Also some yogurts contain ALL the whey.

You really really need to look into forex. It is literally buying money. 
And vanguards are essentially the entry level etfs.

That’s the point of forex. Betting on inflation or deflation of money. The chances of every currency failing is nil.

Yes it could work (and I don’t endorse it). 








Either you belong on r/iamverysmart or you got two things mixed up
ETF - exchange-traded funds
EFT - electronic funds transfer
I am assuming you are using the later which is a forex term for literally handing money over. 
The first one (which we are talking about) is similar to a mutual fund. 


Note that last word. Currencies. Yes people do make money buying and selling money. Forex is how dollars get converted to euros and etc. 
Bitcoin needs to be changed to paper money or it holds zero value. I hate to break that to you but it’s true. If I take bitcoin as a business then I still need to pay my vendor in cold hard cash.

In December wasn’t it like $19k?

Sorry I misunderstood what you were going for there. I think the real currency (just like today) is service and original goods. 
Tobacco producers
Think of the amount of Americans don’t one w how to make a meal from scratch. People will trade all their possessions for stuff like this. And it can’t be retraded. That’s where value lies.

The problem is still you need others to accept it. I hate to break this to you but this is what will happen:
Dollar collapses. Many little businesses decided to accept bitcoin
Big business laughs at crypto currencies. 
People can’t liquidate bitcoin to cash to pay for internet and phone. 
You loose internet and phone and are unable to trade your electronic currency.
