I would imagine that the price of gold would fall somewhat as gold is used as a store of value and if bitcoin becomes mainstream then some people would elect to move their money from gold to crypto. But gold will always carry some form of value. 
Of course, nobody knows for sure what would happen with the price. There are a lot of other variables to consider. 
For instance, if fiat were to fail, I could see both gold and btc rising significantly in value.

If you’re getting into bitcoin to “make a little extra money a month” don’t get into bitcoin. It sounds like you’re not looking long term and you will end up loosing money by having weak hands. Better off getting a part time job. Just my 2 cents.

I can second this, at my previous job I worked as a real estate agent that helped Japanese companies find housing for their expats in Silicon Valley. While spending time with them looking for apartments, I found that a lot of the younger engineers who came here on one year assignments are allowed to choose something to study while they are here. A good majority of them came here to study blockchain technology.

I've made my mind that I'd rather go down with the ship and ride it all the way to $0 then sell before a possible next ATH. I got a death grip on my crypto.

Okay, i wasn't aware of this.
I'm not looking to spend my crypto, just long term secure storage. What is the best way/product to do this?
