Pretty much all real estate is gambling, esp. at this point.

The main reason is that rich people are happy if rich people are allowed to take money from poor people (under threat of force) but much less happy if poor people are allowed to take money from them.
If I have a bottle of water and you want one then there are threats of force to stop you just taking it ... even though you might need it, I'm just the middleman and I could easily absorb the loss of a single item.
If I own a fast food brand you want to sell then it's "fine" for me to charge you for the ability to sell them, it's fine for me to place requirements on how you buy or sell and take a middleman fee on everything you buy/sell ... all under the threat of force if you break my rules.
If you want to live in a country we own together then magically all of the above is now bad.

It depends what you mean by gambling. If you compare people playing slots vs. those putting money in VFIAX the outcomes will be trend very differently (although, sure, on an individual level over a short period of time the results will look randomish).

Network effects are a real thing. IMO Bitcoin is already at the point where there would need to be a huge coordinated push for a different coin to be the leader (and BCH backers tried quite hard and failed, and they had the advantage of splitting).

It's not a banana. Try the same thought experiment with something that has a limited supply, like Art or stock of a company that isn't profitable but still growing. How many people are doing the evaluation matter a lot then.
From anohter point of view paypal is relatively easy to (re)create, but without all the users nobody cares.
Network effects matter.

You bought 1/2 a bitcoin for $500 and sold it for $1,000. The fact you invested a different $500 at the same time doesn't matter, even if you also invested that in a different 1/2 bitcoin.

$15k to $15014.25k sounds like a good return.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:51:34


You still, legally, have to pay tax on those spent bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:57:27


WTF does this even mean. It deserves it because it has always had it and you understand, and bitcoin doesn't because it's new and you don't understand?


"Equity" means almost nothing unless the company is paying dividends. Until then it's basically a gamble that it'll grow and be valued higher (or maybe get bought out).


Yeh, well, trust me it means nothing.
Lots of large companies have had weird valuations for months at a time, there's roughly zero probability that small numbers of investors are going to get this correct more often than large numbers.


You missed the point, you could replicate paypal with a relatively small amount of money ... but it doesn't matter because you couldn't replicate the users. Same with random shitcoins.


I do, I just understand a bunch of things you seem to be missing.

Future costs of food/clothes/utilities are a form of debt.

So this is the price for contracts one month from now?
Currently 16.5k ... which seems optimistically low.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:02:15
Meh, while I agree in principle (it's hard to time and a lot of stress) ... you would come out much better, if it goes to 25k, in your "even ish" example.

1.  -- this can/will happen again on lots of platforms.
2. "Do X, you probably won't get caught" isn't great advice.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:09:53
1. Speak to an accountant.
2. Yes, just like if you sold one stock and bought another.

Daily volume is ~12k BTC. $1 billion USD is currently ~150k BTC. So that's about 12-13 days of current volume.
1. It's not a "colossal amount".
2. Dumping it all at once would be beyond stupid.

There was approximately $1.63 trillion in circulation as of March 21, 2018, of which $1.59 trillion was in Federal Reserve notes.

You make it sound like there is some other choice than paying those things, but you have to live somewhere and all buildings have those costs so you'll have to pay them.
If you rent then someone has to pay property taxes, utilities, etc. etc. If it's you then you are still paying it, if it's not you then it's still you via. your rent.
Interest on the loan also needs to be compared to something, as a simple example you can either buy a 100k with 100k or with 50k and pay interest on the other 50k (which you can write some off against taxes). If you can borrow at 3% and get a long term. bond at 5%, paying the interest is not a losing deal (to be fair there are some tiny risks by doing it this way, and not just buying, but meh.)
Sticking all your eggs in one basket (Eg. BTC) is terrible advice, unless you magically know the future and thus. have no risk.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:40:20
That's not how any of this works.
If it goes to $2k because of some real event that makes it likely BTC won't be viable long term. ... then, sure things have changed, sell.
If the market pricing just goes insane it would be like selling your house for 10% of it's value just because your neighbour did. FFS bitcoin has already had ~80% drops in price from "highs" that most people would be happy to have bought at right now.
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:22:25


Slightly less *in this case*, assuming zero cost bitcoin exchanges. From my calcs. the graphic has ~2.75% total overhead, and I know that I can get UK =&gt; US for about 1% without trying too hard.
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:23:02


You can buy condos, or apartments, etc. The choice doesn't have to be a 350k house or renting an 85k apartment for 90k (over N years). Yes, cheaper things are cheaper and you can invest the money you save ... but renting just can't be cheaper than buying, economically.

The s&amp;p 500 has been going up, with only minor downward blips, for over 9 years. Buying almost anything that tracks it (or does slightly worse, like VYM ;) N years ago will make you look like a genius.
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:11:40


No. Over the long term. you can't expect 10%+ a year returns.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:32:07


Hmmm, let's see how different...


Yep, Bitcoin was created too.


Yep, lots of vision here.


He 100% asked for investment and he 100% got rich because people invested and because of the number of people that joined facebook.


Lots of people are employed working on bitcoin.

No, there is no buying strategy that works if something continues to go down.
Saying that I'm not sure why people don't think it's going to go up again as LN takes off.
@_date: 2019-08-26 05:12:36
I know people who said they were convinced the price was going be close to 6k again. Now it has just bounced off 10k for the second time I wouldn't be shocked if some are reevaluating.

It's gone parabolic man.
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:59:12
Google "gold historical price", pick a site, look at the peak and then the later dip.
@_date: 2019-04-17 16:55:11
If you bought Bitcoin anytime before 2017-10-01 you have at least kept value, if you compare to anytime this year you need to go back a couple more months. For gold you need to go back to 2010ish.
@_date: 2019-04-17 19:38:27
If you bought gold at the peak then in Jan 2016 you'd have "lost" 1/2 of your value. So gold isn't a good store of value?
@_date: 2019-04-17 19:43:05


And the length of time is important because most people who are storing value, or even investing, don't just dump all of their money in at the peak. So if you buy X per. week/month/year for Y time it's much harder to be down with Bitcoin than Gold.
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:50:26
How does sales tax have more "consent" than income tax?
Your analogy to consent is insane though, if you walk into a store and take things but refuse to pay because you didn't consent to paying ... does that seem right?
But you are saying it's fine if you take services from the government and society but refuse to pay?
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:18:26


Each side grows with the other. Like in the US where most local government is mostly funded by RE taxes, the towns that are poor have worse roads/education/libraries/etc.


This also becomes a weird word game, like if you say "I don't pay any taxes, but I have to spend $X per. month for someone to take my trash away and I employ bodyguards so I don't get murdered/robbed and I employ someone to teach my children." ... it's just much more efficient to pool all those services among everyone.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:14:47
There was a 3 year stretch where if you bought at the peak it was always lower. Even if you magically know it'll always grow "long term", you have to take into account it being down from your purchase price for at least 5 years. Mortgaging your house isn't in line with that kind of risk.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:30:31


True, but that doesn't mean people buy one house and pay it off over 15/30 years.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:19:59
