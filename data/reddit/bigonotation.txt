This is called [shorting]( and occurs frequently on other markets too.

Too bad LastPass was hacked like a month ago :-)

This is not credible.

This is what happens when you let teenagers that learned PHP yesterday run online multi-million financial institutes. They got owned by two of the most basic attack vectors in web security:
1. CSRF
2. SQL injection
In hindsight, this was bound to happen. MtGox will get hacked again (if they recover now.) If they don't recover, their successors will face similar problems.

When that happens, Bitcoin is toast.

You're a fucking idiot.

Processing power increases exponentially [Moore's Law], and so must difficulty to be able to maintain linear mining rate.

9 hours later that is 172,000,000 USD.

KEEP CALM AND BUY BITCOIN
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:30:49
In this case it's the opposite -- one very uncalculated risk.
