sure, but isn't that just one type of transaction?  i thought the idea was that more transparency in money transfers in general might help solve the issues of corruption and bribery, etc. But again, I'm not claiming to be an expert on the subject, I'm pretty clueless

i'm not sure, and i'm new here, but that's a problem that i've seen in another sub as well, and i think it's indicative of someone running a program to automatically downvote posts.

is trezor a safe cold storage?
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:31:31
ok this helps.  but i'm literally a 5 year old on this.  what's a speed limit? what's a 'fork' (i keep seeing that term)?

dont.  ledger is better.  i literally bought a ledger nano s because trezor had said for over 8 months that ethereum access was 'upcoming'.... now i have both.  trezor is good but ledger is better user interface and cheaper.  assuming theyre equally safe (im no expert) id go ledger on amazon.

while i agree, that was borderline obnoxiously written.  my head hurts.  good points though
