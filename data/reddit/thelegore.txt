I think you could have two wallets, one offline, but with an open channel, this would contain your larger account, and one hot wallet. When you needed to refill your hot wallet, you could turn on your cold wallet and refill it. It could still use a lightning network transaction, so it would be free still.

Do you read history at all? Lack of rule of law sucks to live in.

Don't be obtuse, that's why they want people to test it.

Lol.. not true at all

So like crypto based phone two factor auth - without the first factor auth?

Sweet! I was thinking of putting one bitcoin stashed away where I can't get to it for a few years. That way my emotions wouldn't play into it at all.

That settles it, I was gonna buy my new desktop using my tax return money on Newegg, but they were too slow! Tigerdirect it is

Ahhh, clever. I may do that. Is there a tool to send transactions with a lock time? I could do it myself, but I'd have to write and test the script

I cashed out my signing bonus stock to buy bitcoin, because I recognize potential. I'm 22 and just starting my career, so I can afford to lose that money on a big risk like this. Though it would be nicer if it pays out of course :)

Soo, something with decentralized exchanges?

Ah, I thought you meant all functions were defined globally first, then there definitions would be provided (I was thinking like c++ header files). That makes sense.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:02:16
Wouldn't it then be possible to do recursion by having two functions defined at the beginning. A and B defined as 
A := B()
B := A()

If he did the bet in bitcoin, wouldn't that be hedging his bet kinda?

Would stealth addresses help with this?

[Link to the thread]( very interesting read

The printer might be an attack vector in this case, better off generating a 24 work mnemonic on a linux live cd, &amp; write down the key (or even better, commit to memory) take note of the xpub, then send to one of those addresses

I disagree, at least in theory, intellectual property rights are intended to encourage creators to publish their works, contributing to the overall well being &amp; culture of human society, by allowing them to profit off of their work through a temporary monopoly. That being said, copyright and patent law has lost sight of that goal and seems to be geared towards maximizing profit for the owner of those copyrights/patents, rather than striking a balance between private and public good.

I don't know if this is true. Sure the end point sales don't have the dangers normal black market deals do, but the production still does.

This would work so well for a 'pay what you want' album.

It's unprofitable to buy new ones, but if you already bought a mining unit that doesn't use much power then running it is the best way to recoup some of your losses. Eventually the power cost may trump profits, but that depends on the unit you have.

Nice. Whenever I learn more about Bitcoin I am astounded by how well thought out it is.

Probably won't recognize it as "Legal tender" for all debts public and private. As "Legal" currency yes.
