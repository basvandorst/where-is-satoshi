Here's something that I've wondered for a while:
Say a gas station won't accept my $100 bill.  Now, it's well within their right to not accept it for pre-payment, yeah?  Can I go grab a bottle of soda and open it, thereby creating a debt, and now they *must* accept it?

You’re getting 2% back, but paying 3% (or more) extra for your goods because the merchant is passing the processing fee along. You’re still paying the 3% higher fee with cash, or silver, or crypto also, since most places won’t discount it. Just know you’re not “making money” on the transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:53:07
The other thing that might happen if we require that number of transactions is scaling transaction fees.  If you're paying amazon, set a low fee because it doesn't need to confirm in the next block (or 5).  If you're paying for a cup of coffee, set a high fee to make sure it goes through before you leave.
EDIT: Or using "green addresses" that are attached to your personal information; that way your tx is immediately accepted (before any confirmations), and if you double spend they send you a bill.
This kind of stuff is what really makes me excited about the whole experiment.  The only limitations seem to be in the imagination of those working on the project (you and I included).

The point being made is that bitcoin is helping to close the gap between the rich and the poor; all I'm saying is that the poor will still be poor, and the only gap that's being closed is between the ultra-wealthy and the semi-wealthy.

The possible application of [assurance contracts]( are fascinating, and this stuff is just the start.
Right now, though, what I'm most interested in is the adoption rate.  Bitcoin isn't an easy concept to wrap your head around: you're telling me there's a decentralized, p2p verifiable ledger of all transactions and by owning bitcoin you own a key that enables you to transfer ownership of this store of value, and people accept this?  That's a really heady idea.  I'm blown away by the number of people that not only can understand and rationalize this idea, but trust in it enough to accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services.  Maybe I'm just naive and the majority of people are seeing "bitcoin increases xxxx%!!!", but I have hopes that the current spread of awareness (and adoption) speaks volumes about the intelligence of the average human and how far we've come in the last 20 years.

I wholeheartedly agree with this, but is it really any different than when they talk about anything else?  I'm sure if you or I were a petroleum refinement engineer or software developer, we'd roll our eyes anytime there's a story about current barrel production or the newest Windows version.
I certainly hope that a majority of the people putting money into the bitcoin community understand how the system works (at least at a level as vague as I described it previously), but with the reddit selection bias it seems to be 50/50 (detailed conversation and "lol, is now when i should buy?").  I think "measured" speculation is off the table for now, as long as the "gains" are continually meteoric.
I think I'm going to [bitcointalk]( for actual discussion from now on, although we probably should have been there all along for these types of discussions.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:12:07
Think of it like bullion coins. A 1oz gold eagle has a face value of $50.  You have to pay ~$1500 for one (the price of gold), but if gold tanks to under $50/oz you could always spend it for $50.  It's never worthless, but the "face value" of a colored coin will be much much lower than what you paid for it.

That's not true at all.  Let me relay my story to you.  I bought 5BTC @ $30 back in Jan/Feb, and held on through the April crash.  Unfortunately I sold  over the summer.  I didn't sell because I stopped believing in bitcoin; I didn't sell because I wanted to make a profit.  I sold because I'm poor as shit, and something came up where I needed &lt;$1000 and I didn't have it anywhere else.  Now, there's a very real chance I will never have a bitcoin balance that high ever again, and it's most certainly not because of indifference.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:06:23


That would be a fantastic thing, but it's far from happening.  In the meantime, what's to stop the current ASIC manufacturers using their first-mover advantage to stifle competition?
Here's a situation: the devs have shown that they can (and do) work on protocol changes behind closed doors (ex: coinvalidation).  What's to stop them from working on a change that benefits the BTC wealthy at the expense of the BTC poor?  Are there enough miners (currently, and in the near-term) that would altruistically reject this change in favor of the common man (at the expense of their own self-interests)?
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:43:45
But the poor (the majority) cannot afford to keep a stash - there's always something that comes up and wipes out their entire savings.  At that point, you may be able to re-save the relative purchasing power but the nominal value will never be replaced.  Take my above example for instance.  I had 5BTC ($150 at purchase, $600 at sale) in savings.  Now, I may someday be able to place $600 of purchasing power back into savings but at that point it may only nominally be 0.5BTC instead of 5BTC that it once was.
Where this gets interesting is if/when BTC will be paid to workers: instead of receiving less purchasing power for your work over time (due to inflation), you may receive the same purchasing power for your work but at nominally lower values of currency.  How are people going to react when they made 0.0125BTC last year and make 0.0123BTC this year (even though the purchasing power has remained the same)?
EDIT: My point is - only those who can afford to put money away for long points of time are the ones that are benefitting; thus only the semi-wealthy and ultra-wealthy are certain to get ahead.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:49
They're *currently* capped at 1MB; it's open source software, and that can be changed in the future if need be.
Personally, I don't see it being used to pay for a cup of coffee or the like, but you're right: if all online purchases were made with BTC, 1MB per block wouldn't be enough to facilitate quick confirmations.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:28:05
I just received an order from amagimetals (paid for in BTC), so there's at least one positive review.

That's part of the allure; there are no accounts, and there isn't a way to tie you to that wallet (if you don't want there to be).  If you need to receive funds, you have to give out your address.


The private key is tied to the public address, and not the client.  You can import your private keys into a number of different wallet clients (or none at all) if you choose.


Your private keys are saved in your wallet.dat file.  If you need to reinstall the client or start using a different client (desktop or cloud), you'll need to import those private keys to give you access to spend the funds located in that address.  You do have a backup (or 5) of the wallet.dat file, right?  Make one now.

That's not necessarily true.  Have you ever had two fresh $20s stick together?  A legitimate business would hand one back to you, but a shady dude wouldn't.  It's the same with this.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:45:53
The money in the early 30s was not fiat money, which is why deflation happened; there wasn't enough gold and silver to go around, hence it's purchasing power went up.  This is why we came off the gold standard, and eventually started using fiat money.

[Over 3/4 of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck]( and I'd venture to say the same is true in Europe (although I don't have evidence of this).  The general public doesn't have the resources to put money away and forget about it (regardless of the store of wealth they choose), so how can you say that indifference is the cause for not seizing this opportunity?
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:26:04
For most purchases: yes.  For a select few: no.
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:27:22
I'm definitely interested in both, and I think it's cool that you could buy and sell silver for bitcoin.  Personally, I don't have either right now *shifty eyes*.

That's where we have to hope the new elite are as progressive as they seem to be (so far).
Would 5BTC have put me in the upper-echelon?  Would I be afforded privileges that current 1%ers are under the traditional system?  I'm not sure on the first, and we'll have to wait and see how the rich and powerful decide to use their wealth and power to influence the coming infrastructure.
Increasingly, mining is going the way of consolidated power and has probably left the reaches of the masses.  I'd venture that in the short term, we'll see less than 100 major players controlling 51% of the network: at that point, changes to the protocol will be decided between the devs (rich and powerful) and the miners (rich and powerful).  What changes will they make?  Will they continue to develop for the good of the system, or the good of themselves?

Blocks are still solved in an average of 10 minutes; the number of transactions doesn't change that.  Right now, there's a cap of 1MB per block.  If your internet isn't fast enough to download a new 1MB every 10 minutes, you're probably not cut out to be a miner.  Assuming 144 blocks per day (at the maximum size of 1MB), we'd be adding ~50GB to the blockchain every year.  One TB hard drives cost practically nothing, so there's no worry about needing a centralized server to store the blockchain.
