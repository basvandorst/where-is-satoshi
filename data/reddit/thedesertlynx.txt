Yeah... I guess it'll just be a minimum amount on a Xapo card for the 10 or so a month it'll be, while I wait for everything to turn BTC-only.
@_date: 2016-08-09 05:00:25
I have never ever used an exchange in my life, yet they keep on wrecking the value of my Bitcoin every time one of them gets hacked. Started to get tired of this...
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:03:29
A mix of both. I live in New Hampshire where I can just message any number of acquaintances and sell BTC at a moment's notice for cash. The local farmer's market takes Bitcoin, as do my landlord and coworking space. I can buy gas cards through Purse, as well as just about any online purchase (Amazon is huge).
The big one is gift cards. I'm starting to build a site which will list everywhere you can use Bitcoin by proxy through gift cards (has to be able to be done at the register). I'm nowhere near done and I've already listed hundreds of options:
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:11:50
lol what?
@_date: 2016-08-21 14:28:27
From what I've heard, sure... except you can't live off of it. Does a single business even accept/pay in Monero?
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:59:52
What other brands are coming up? Also, will you ever offer precise-amount buying like eGifter does?
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:28:30
Bitcoin debit cards are that awkward stage between the normal financial world and the future. Basically, they're a great way of bootstrapping it until Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted. And they're still better than banking, because they can't be shut down as easily (which is why Uber in Argentina is using them).
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:11:09
Good for you! Get it on CoinMap! Also, try to make sure one customer per week goes in there and uses Bitcoin for something.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:57:27
Yes, that's been me all this year, except I kept a bank account on hand in case I needed to swipe something. How do you get over the lack of a card?
@_date: 2016-08-21 06:46:14
I ask because, for me, privacy is the most important factor, for very much the same reasons as you've outlined. I mean I'm hardcore in that I get all my income in Bitcoin without any official wage conversion or paperwork, I try to spend it as directly as possible, and even when I get a debit card I'm keeping it unverified so I'm completely off the financial system.
Assuming you're a US resident with a normal job, there's not a lot you can do to make wages, bill-paying, and debit cards anonymous (though BitPay doesn't require any ID paperwork, only an SSN). However, you can break away from "big Bitcoin" (Coinbase), which has been known to track, and police, your Bitcoin transactions.
Check out this article on staying private when buying Bitcoin:
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:12:00
Sounds good. I get everything directly BTC and my landlord has agreed to accept it (in the meantime cash). Really, the only thing I'd need a card for is online payments that don't take BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:14:06
Nice, looks good. Thanks for the tip.
And when you make the move hit me up. Come to the coast!
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:56:47
Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:52:05
Over the course of the year, bank fees have... and I've net gained by far from my Bitcoin investments. Not sure how this is relevant to the current discussions, but ok...
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:15:58
And I don't have more than that in any one BTC wallet, in cash, or on my Bitcoin debit card. If only banks and big exchanges like BitFinex did the same...
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:16:15
I like European fit/fitted/slim. V-neck option is preferred. Will you be selling them for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:24:03
Mostly not private. If you use Bitcoin directly whenever possible and either sell it for cash or use gift card services, you can keep debit card usage to a minimum. Buy a few different cards, and you can last a while without ever being verified.
@_date: 2016-08-21 05:00:22
I'm doing the exact same thing. I make 100% Bitcoin income and closed my bank account. Question to OP: do you care about privacy? In other words, does it bother you at all to give the same level of disclosure as when you were banked?
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:15:31
Honesty goes a long way.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:51:52
Walmart for Bitcoin would be a first. Is there any way to have cards available with consistency? I've been caught in an awkward situation at Starbucks because I was prepared to pay with my AirBitz wallet, only to find no cards available at the register. I had to use Gyft, which made me wait almost a half-hour for one confirmation before I could use it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:42:34
BofA. Now I'm going unbanked. :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:55:30
If I absolutely need a card but can't do anything else I might just do a Bitcoin card.
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:00:32
Yeah, it sucked because I make 100% cryptocurrency (like 75% Bitcoin 25% Dash) and have no bank account anymore, so getting groceries is a pain.
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:47:48
Fun fact: Gyft is out of Walmart gift cards (or stopped supporting them), and never let you pay Bitcoin for them anyway. You could be the first!
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:20:04
OP: You hit a really interesting point, Bitcoin's early distribution was pretty technocracy-heavy. I wrote an op-ed about this subject a while ago, let me know if this answers anything:
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:34:44
I didn't have a checkbook.
@_date: 2016-08-01 04:13:05
Thanks for sharing. In defense of Gary's language, that's just how he talks lol. As for Ross, Lynn Ulbricht has stated that Gary has promised her several times to pardon Ross.
@_date: 2016-08-25 03:27:33
Really cool man, thanks! I'd love to do another article when there's a nice bit of news to latch on to. Also I need to get one of these! Btw, is the Darkcoin one going to get updated?
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:38:09
Same thing that happens if someone steals your cash. Which hasn't happened. The banks, on the other hand, have been happy to hand over my money to someone else without due diligence.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:14:30
Sound advice. That's why it's awesome how easy it is to diversify investment these days. I can even buy gold and silver with Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2016-08-26 13:31:19
If you guys release one for Dash, I know I'd be interested, and know several others who would be.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:37:56
Nice going, especially in getting a two-way. So many are only fiat to crypto, which leaves someone like me (making 100% of income in Bitcoin) out of luck.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:11:03
How does that compare with other Bitcoin debit cards? I'm trying to avoid involvement with Coinbase if possible.
@_date: 2016-08-26 22:14:26
Great little town, and so Bitcoin friendly. I chose the right place to work.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:12:05
Interesting, good going! Did you get it on CoinATMRadar?
@_date: 2016-04-29 22:27:49
Duly noted, however this was meant as an intro to Bitcoin for people with no real understanding or prior knowledge. Start laying on too many layers, and you get a novel that no one will read.
I look forward to your extended allegorical version.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:54:58
They weren't the ones who came up with that though. When asked what their customer base was like, that's what they answered.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:44:48
Yeah that's the Blockchain Institute of Technology. Dr. Darren Tapp presented his Dash scaling paper that was published by Arizona State University there.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:49:48
It's no surprise that there's already about 1,000 different businesses taking Dash in the country. I've heard from activists on the ground that a whole lot of people still hold Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:29:39
Satoshi premined Bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:08:18
This is what Evan Duffield told the Core team over 4 years ago, and they shut him down, so he went off to create Dash. Similar stories with Ethereum and Decred. Bitcoin needing to improve privacy is a symptom of what's really an adaptation problem.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:28:29
Then why is Bitcoin still without basic privacy protections, a half\-decade later?
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:10:47
That's probably the most powerful display of cognitive dissonance I've seen in recent times. Please reread that first sentence several times and then check it against the facts to see if you are still comfortable standing by it.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:07:04
There exist other options than take advantage of good wallets or develop something yourself. Not every other option is "believing scammers" lol
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:13:24
I was talking about it on Bitcoin Talk Show. It's the first couple of minutes. Chekkit: 
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:44:35
No, that's not true. A lot of us, myself included, run partner shops through Spreadshirt. It's how we make a living. And my client base is spread between two continents, and Bitcoin would make that so much easier. Businesses are skittish to accept new forms of payment, which is why we're doing this drive to make them feel more secure in the decision.
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:15:17
Well it is telling that every major incompleteness in present-day Bitcoin has ended up being the prime feature of some other project.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:00:34
Wow, that's great!
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:05:56
Nope, several miners were active before the bug was fixed. Even today, you can see just how good the [distribution]( of the coin is. Just compare with [Litecoin]( which is 3 years older.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:47:19
I'd never seen anything like it before. We're living in a new age.
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:21:36
Thanks for doing this. I'll do my part.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:10:36
To my understanding, most Bitcoin users are satisfied with the level of privacy it provides for everyday transactions. Most users would likely use a different coin when they wanted to go dark. Other than that, it would probably make the most sense to include a built-in coin mixing service similar to Dash's PrivateSend.
@_date: 2016-03-20 03:32:33
Except Peacekeeper never ever worked. This one is already saving lives.
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:18:28
Thanks for sharing. It's really significant when you have full-on crypto-anarchists inside a state's legislature. I expect to see great things out of New Hampshire in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-19 16:33:27
It's a powerful tool. How people use it is up to them, but it tends to be more effective for public stuff and defensive use.
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:53:39
Highly. Peacekeeper had a bunch of superfluous stuff like tribes, required you to input your home address, and had no geolocation for alerts. This one doesn't need your private information and help directly to your location.
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:31:28
Exactly. The kinds of things made possible by blockchain tech are pretty nuts.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:49:42
True. We only need one real post on each overarching issue, anyway. To not report the good stuff happening is, in my opinion, not presenting an accurate picture of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-20 03:32:51
There's lots of ways of doing that. :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:15:37
True, and believe me, they've tried. I know for a fact, though, that several people who would nullify in the right case have gotten on juries. I know because I'm friends with them, and have seen them show up at the courthouse, and have kind of given them a wink.
Besides, no one knows exactly who will and who won't nullify. If every juror knows they can nullify (NH's case), you won't know until there's a verdict who will or won't. This leads law enforcement and prosecutors to only go after cases they're more confident in winning.
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:30:06
Laughter yes, mockery no.
@_date: 2016-06-22 05:30:13
You can say that again. I'm not sure who's more ridiculous, them or her.
@_date: 2016-11-14 05:12:54
I use Wirex and it works very well. It's good to be able to have a verified card as well as unverified.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:28:56
Yeah I noticed they started requiring a confirmation. It's made my life a whole lot harder.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:57:37
I don't see how "I can send micropayments on-chain and that's cool" is an idolization of personality. It kind of makes perfect sense to be honest.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:11:02
Why wouldn't this affect a service like BitPay then?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:15:51
Hm, and this doesn't apply to Purse and Gyft?
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:34:04
I've been telling people for a while to avoid "big Bitcoin." Buy with cash.
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:57:27
It all went downhill when Bitcoin chose the store of value/speculative path rather than the radical digital cash of a free people path.
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:02:12
I've been a Bitcoin fan and regular user for a long time, and this year I went all in and closed my bank account. But now, it's getting really hard. I'm afraid to sell everyday businesses and users on it in case they get one of those all-day transactions and just give up.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:53:01
In the future use Wall of Coins, get it without giving up all this private info.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:28:17
So at the moment, the answer is: "wait for a good off-chain solution to be implemented." How soon do you expect one of these solutions to be ready?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:04:35
Know of any WP widget that would work?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:46:17
That's true, and it's certainly something good to hope for. Unfortunately, a couple bad opportunists could spoil the whole "trust zero-conf transactions" thing for the rest of us.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:26:00
So it's all a risk assessment game. That kind of sounds like a ticking time bomb until double spends become common. Then all instant transactions are over for good.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:16:16
Yeah that makes sense. Don't most wallets disallow double spends though?
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:12:52
It tends to work better. That's why grocery stores ask "Do you want to donate a dollar to cancer research?" That little appeal makes people have to either say "no" or donate.
@_date: 2016-12-13 22:24:30
If this attitude prevails, Bitcoin is missing out big time. Other cryptocurrencies will be more than glad to eat up the everyday use piece of the market share.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:13:44
Very good info, though I would amend it to "stop heavily relying on those cards." Having one can be what allows people to wean themselves off of a bank account and receive 100% income in Bitcoin (as I have done).
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:24:38
So if you fill your 14 gallon tank, you break even after the transaction fee. Ouch.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:04:46
Hahaha savage! Yes you're right, expect to see it in the coming years I assume.
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:40:51
Bit of a n00b. I don't have fiat and still pay for my hotel and drinks in Dash.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:07:34
Now in [meme form](
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:36:16
Woo, nice Dash branding! Could use the new logo though.
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:13:12
This troll army? :)
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:36:09
Ah dammit, I sold my trench coat when I stopped selling Moneros on the street corner to high school kids. Never mind! :)

Pssssh 5 years from now? I do that now.
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:51:14
Reminds me of cheap Bitcoin.com mining pool! :)
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:44:39
It definitely helps to have people who believe in Bitcoin and are willing to go to great lengths to promote its use.
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:13:53
Btw does anyone know if the Dragon's Den pays? If so I would be interested, troll patrol is a specialty of mine.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:20:45
First, Bitcoin needs instant confirmations and sub-cent fees. Next, it needs to be faster and easier to use than cards. Beyond that, merchants will pile on if it's easy enough (and someone shows them) to become part of the future before they're left behind, and users who get excited to spend it will drive the demand. That's how it works here in New Hampshire where I live 100% off crypto (no bank account) and there are dozens of businesses that take it locally. I also [wrote an op-ed]( on just this subject.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:05:50
Cheers! Also I was on a [CNN segment]( talking about it back when I was fat. ;)
@_date: 2016-09-01 20:55:39
What do you mean by "deposit to 'Gyft cards'"? When buying in the Gyft app, it always gave options for credit card or PayPal, but none for Bitcoin. It was the only gift card they had without a Bitcoin option.
@_date: 2016-09-02 21:21:40
Hm, interesting. For some reason, they didn't let you just buy the card straight with Bitcoin, only for Walmart.
@_date: 2016-09-03 01:24:04
True, though that requires more foresight and work. You have to order the cards in advance, wait for them to get there in the mail, and then either carry them with you or load them into Gyft or eGifter. With eGifter, you can literally just walk into a Dunks on a whim with nothing but Bitcoin and get something.
@_date: 2016-09-04 16:49:29
This is true. Sometimes, though, foresight has a price. It's good to have options where people can spontaneously act and still be fine.
@_date: 2016-09-06 12:39:17
Yep, I agree with the whole "phase out gubmint" thing. In the meantime, strengthen your crypto.
@_date: 2016-09-13 15:23:26
Stop the self-flagellation, just use Wall of Coins. You could have your BTC for cash in minutes, and not have to deal with all the AML/KYC nonsnese. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:47:19
Record low, along with a low in transactions. If no one uses it, the price won't get jacked up. Simple, but sad.
@_date: 2016-09-03 01:25:15
Yeah, try walking into McDonald's and just buying cash from someone there with Bitcoin. You can literally walk into a Dunks on a whim, pay at the register with Bitcoin for the exact amount.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:49:35
Amanda is doing a new general crypto show. I've heard talks of Ben doing his own crypto show as well, I'll keep everyone updated.

They're significantly lower than 490k a year ago. Recovering slightly after falling off a cliff doesn't reverse the cliff fall.
@_date: 2019-01-16 01:47:34
I did, maybe you should look again.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:50:39
Pretty sure that statement just disproves your point :D
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:45:53
Congratulations on reaching over to the other side, which has been censored here. Keep paying attention to both sides of the argument, truly and sincerely. The truth speaks for itself in time.

Great post, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:45:47
I'll ask him if he can add one, and update you @_date: 2016-10-09 16:33:59
I believe Wall of Coins does this seamlessly, but I can't remember if that feature was out yet or to be implemented very soon.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:36:14
lol I got that, I meant do you mean that the current Bitcoin environment, or rather cryptocurrency as a whole, is necessarily an adversarial environment?
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:27:21
"Altcoin propaganda" by "the show that launched Bitcoin." This is what we've come to.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:43:19
That's a rather dishonest characterization of the situation.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:26:32
As opposed to...?
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:28:35
It is. I believe he was born Ian Bernard, but legally changed it later.
@_date: 2016-07-26 02:39:03
Gyft is more universal and efficient. I think what we should do is pressure eGifter to vastly streamline their clunky design, so we can abandon Gyft altogether.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:47:42
Yeah, that wouldn't be my first choice of a metaphor. Would it help if the author were African...? :D
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:11:58
Alright, I'll keep you in mind.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:53:57
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:57:38
I wish we still had the old Coinye. :/
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:16:07
Love it. I wish Bitcoin could get into the hands of everyone, but sometimes other tools are more well-refined.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:14:18
I'm not looking to buy a shirt for Bitcoin, but to design and sell one online through a site like CafePress, but which takes Bitcoin. The idea is to sell for BTC individually without having to pre-make a bunch.
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:48:27
Any details besides "the state of Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2016-07-19 13:16:34
As far as I know that's in no way associated with the man himself. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 13:10:25
It's not hollow if he can't pay any expenses with it. Plenty of businesses accept Bitcoin and don't hold any for this reason.
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:00:14
Yeah never heard of him. My knowledge is limited to the four biggest parties (R, D, Libertarian and Green)... and, of course, Vermin Supreme.
@_date: 2016-07-20 21:27:19
Hahaha I wrote that first article! You gotta check the date, man. And this part at the bottom:
"[Happy april fools day]"
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:34:31
What can you refute in the article's content? Put up or shut up.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:37:10
Yeah, that's crazy! Activate Segwit now and.... still have pretty high fees I guess. :D
@_date: 2016-07-19 05:35:46
Rand Paul and Gary Johnson were the only major candidates to accept Bitcoin donations this year. Whatever their policies, that alone is very telling.
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:50:18
Yeah, it's weird. I'm sure I could set up some shop thing through Mycelium and then just buy/ship myself, but I'd rather have it be seamless.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:48:21
I'm glad to have turned away such a person. Win/win for us!
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:04:46
Wait, are Bitcoiners the grumpy old men now? Wow, this world changes fast! :)
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:13:26
Sure, I'll let you know what I find. I'm not super interested in a high profit margin, just some passive recurring income while spreading around some great designs. More than that though, I just want to be able to get/distribute a few certain designs. Profit/business is a secondary consideration.
@_date: 2016-07-25 22:32:00
It's sad that people think they need government to help people out, while they themselves raise enough money to raise entire nations out of poverty, for one guy.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:28:20
Nope. I suggest you, you know, read.
@_date: 2016-07-19 05:37:47
