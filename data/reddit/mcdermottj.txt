Yes, I guess it's possible. But I still don't see why he would have taken so much time and effort just to give me a made up story. I mean, if it was just lulz he was after, then I don't see what was funny about what he did. I'm inclined to believe him after the extent of my communication with him.

I appreciate it! It's something I hadn't considered, and wish I'd known before interviewing him. But I still have confidence in the story in light of that knowledge.

So you believe the American financial system will implode?
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:22:10
This is a valid point.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:06:35
Lol. What do you think is going to happen? I've worked as a professional journalist for the past seven years, covering topics far more sensitive than this, and am more than willing to prove my identity to anyone who's skeptical.

I'm a Bitcoin neophyte, yes, so if there's a way to do this while protecting your information, I'm open to it.
And I'm not scared, but I appreciate your concern.

I don't even know what that is. So maybe.

Interesting. I ask, because I'm a reporter and working on a story about a startup that's urging people to roll their 401(k) savings into a Bitcoin IRA.

Then they don't have to show me their Bitcoin address. I'm not even going to put those details in the story anyway. Why would I?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:56:32
I'm just saying I have a proven, public track record if anyone would care to vet me.
And I get that people want anonymity, but I also need to do my due diligence and confirm that they do indeed have as much Bitcoin as they claim. That's merely sound journalistic practice.
Tor, yes. Not GPG.

Who said I was unfamiliar? I'm not an avid reader, but I know who the guy is. I remember his Colbert appearance.

I really hope not. I asked the moderators of this sub to help me find someone to interview. And I don't think the man I interviewed would have gone to the lengths he did just to mess with me. It was a weeks-long process of exchanging emails, convincing him to let me interview him, figuring out a secure communication medium he was comfortable using, and ultimately doing the actual interview, which took about an hour and a half.
