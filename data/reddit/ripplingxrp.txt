You’re right that’s where xlm comes into play via ripple interledger ��

Like Brad garglinghouse at ripple said , who would go buy stuff with bitcoin and  pay high fees when there’s a crypto that charges .0003 ! Lowest fee of s crypto ��

Bitcoin god fork could see rise to 15k plus 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:52:44
Ripple will be a market leader one day ! Probably not 10k like bitcoin but market cap wise it will be top !

It’s the most hated because it’s not showing it’s true value yet. It’s a long term investment not a daily one. One day you’ll eat those words.

Actually they can change the rule if they agree and increase the 21m supply!

If you’re still in profit then say , no need to quit institutional money is coming soon. You either want the handbags nice holidays or the homeless shelter down the road. Take it or leave it.

Interesting ! Going up on cryptos or cryptos dumping ��

Institutional money will come when its platform targeted for institutions goes live this week !

The other thing to consider is , where did you invest ? If your all in on bitcoin then that might not of been the best idea. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:38:10
Bitcoin has many faults ! 
@_date: 2019-02-18 11:16:50
It’s not fast and it’s not cheap , that just two things it claims to be that it isn’t. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:06:53
What reason does bitcoin have to be 30,000. 
With all its faults and with speculation market gone?
Until it can do what it says it is , bitcoin has no chance of going to 20k again.
I agree that some cryptos can exceed their previous highs but not many will. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 11:26:47
Why do you think this bear has been so long ? Speculative whales have gone away. Speculation will not drive a 20k pump dump again.

What’s the impact for btc on this ?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:51:02
Would it drop ? 
Why would it stay there ?

Who thinks kraken will end up shutting down ?

Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:33:04
Clearly your only into bitcoin because of money to. That’s what’s driven you to crypto ! 
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:04:09
Why do you hope they do ? So many people hold crypto on there so they’ll need to withdraw. If you’ve made an error is that not your fault of the address you used was wrong ?

Who would know it’s been sold and fiat has been deposited to your sons bank ?
