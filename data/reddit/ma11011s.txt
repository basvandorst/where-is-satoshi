This is amazing, i can now rely on my own and people i trust without a third party. My funds are way more secure, i cannot imagine how to do this with FIAT money or gold for that matter! Thanks for answering!
edit: aha, Shamir's secret sharing scheme implementation is also an option (ssss), this software is in the debian repo

those few bitcoins were just recently sent to the first address used in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:13:07
I'm sorry you feel that way.

Perfect! From what i understand javascript is used and they tell:
  All computations are performed in your browser. Your secret and the computed shares are never transmitted back to our servers.

Do you got that statement from the western media or from your own judgment?

Interesting! Now i get it, thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:11:13
Yes thank you. You are definitely right about the deflationary nature and thus no fixed prices.
So, can i summarize that the daytraders are mostly responsible for the price growing to $100.000 or higher?
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:24:48
me to.. apparently bitplaats does not verify the bitcoin address 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:25:07

@_date: 2013-12-02 12:25:29

I too have good experience with kraken. I am curious how they will operate with, let say, triple volume.
