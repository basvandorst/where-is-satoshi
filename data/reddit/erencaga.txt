Thanks for the advice! I have already worked with python (numpy) mostly for engineering mathematics. So, I agree that it should be easy for me to improve my coding skills on python, and then I can branch into C++ (which also I am using for simple coding on finite element methods). Also, yeah, I will check some mining companies on linkedin. Let's see.

I am an electrical engineering student with focus on electric power engineering. I also have electronics and communications engineering degree. Soon, I will have a master's degree in power engineering. However, I have a strong desire to switching to a career path that is Bitcoin related. Whether it is working in a mining company, or working on open source code for wallets, mixers, etc., doesn't matter. 
I see that I lack coding skills required for Bitcoin core development work, or lightning network code development work. However, I learn fast, and adapt quickly to new topics. And if push comes to the shove, I am willing to learn coding in a more professional manner.
What would be my best option? How can I swing to another career path from electrical power engineering to Bitcoin development, or infrastructure (mining, mesh networks) work?
I ask this, since this is Mentor Monday. I don't expect you to draw a full career path for me (that's my responsibility). However, any advice is fair game.

You are spot on! I totally feel this ambiguity regarding making a living out of Bitcoin (apart from price speculation, which most people lose money, and which I have no interest in). 
I agree with your 1st advice and I will follow that advice.
Regarding your 2nd advice, I am going to our local bitcoin meetups regularly. And I will keep an eye on the hackathons.
Regarding your 3rd advice, I already am listening to numerous podcasts :) like, SLP, what bitcoin did, Bitcoin Rapid-Fire, TFTC, Guns n' Bitcoin, The Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast, The Bitcoin Magazine Podcast, and a few more others.
Regarding your 4th advice, yes, Bitcoin twitter is useful in learning about conferences, etc.
Regarding your 5th advice, I have heard about Justin's Buidl bootcamp, and I will definitely consider attending it. Also, I know about Jimmy Song's Programming Blockchain, though it requires physical presence in Las Vegas, afaik. I am in Europe. And yes! I heard about chaincode residency, and I will check it out!
Regarding your 6th advice, I am going to check it out!
Thanks for the detailed advice! Really helps!
