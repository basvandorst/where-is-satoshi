Can't you say the same thing about any bank? Regular banks could potentially be hacked too and lots of money can be stolen. Banks make sure their security is up to scratch so that won't happen happen. Same thing here.

I literally bought 2 days before the crash. At 13.5 so better off than you and many others though.

At least I did. Statted investing in stocks a few months ago, made a few gains and zero losses. Figured I'd try crypto. Kinda regretting it now.

Like I said the $9 in Bitcoin that I'm supposed to receive is the amount after transactions. The ChangeTip page said what the BTC amount will be after the transaction fee.
Also it seems that Bitcoin fees are currently pretty low. My wallet app says right now the recommended transaction fee is $1.5 (usually it's $5-$10).

Developing an app isn't something impossible that a 16 year old can't do. I actually have some friends that developed their own app around that age and it even got fairly popular. I probably could have also developed an app at 16 if I devoted enough time and effort to it. It's not impossible.

I don't get exactly what you're saying. By now I already received my BTC from ChangeTip. The amount I received is worth $9 just like the estimate they give me.

A month ago Bitcoin futures started trading in Wall Street. Simplifying what futures is, it's basically speculating and betting on what the Bitcoin price will be in the future. So a month ago some Wall Street investors were speculating the Bitcoin price will go down in a month. The consipracy theory is that these investors may have manipulated the market so it will come down to the values they bet on.
This is a super simplified explantation and I may have got some bits wrong, still it should give you the general idea.

Yes I noticed this too. My question - are the low fees just because there aren't many transactions right now or something else?

There used to be a popular Bitcoin tipping site that worked on Reddit with the help of a bot. It was actually shut down a while back and people who didn't claim their tips in eventually lost them.
I just checked and it was called ChangeTip. Turns out you can still withdraw if you have anything there. A $0.25 tip some gave me two years ago is now worth $9 (after fees), pretty cool! I thought it was lost but was able to withdraw it now.

Oh that's why I'm not going to use those $9 in BTC in isolation. I sent them to my wallet so I'll either HODL or sell them with the rest of the Bitcoin I have there. I agree that even a fee of "just" $1.5 is too much for most small purchases, hopefully the Lightning network will really fix this.

I'm confused on whether Copay property supports SegWit or not.

Interesting thanks

Except that's not how it works, and usually it's the other way around. When a company increases its dividend stock price often goes up, because people want in on the dividend.

The GIF conveys it really well. I've never seen *The Office* but I understood the scene even before reading your comment.
