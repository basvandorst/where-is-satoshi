Yes, you have taxable income. 
Since you have millions of dollars in bitcoins, what you need to do is the following:
Pack up to new zealand. They accept foreigners with 5 million in investment.
Buy a turnkey business, hire a manager who runs it. 
Cash out your bitcoin.
Buy a boat. 
Use the extra money for good and nice things, like helping poor people, education for orphans or something humanitarian.
50% OF EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR YOU PAY IN TAX TO THE US GOVERNMENT GOES TO:
Paying for killing idiots in the desert. 
Paying for militarizing police to terrorize poor people.
Paying for interest on debts. 
Let the US government default, and the dollar collapse. The government is entirely corrupt and should be overthrown through starvation.

I would propose the following hard fork to fix this solution-
All bitcoin wallets that have not posted a transaction for 50 years should be emptied, and the current supply of bitcoin decreased by that amount. That way, death and coin loss does not affect the supply of coins, and miners can re-mine coins that are lost. 
Also, 50 years is arbitrary. We can increase that to 100 or even 1,000 years if you like. The point is, that coin loss is a long term threat and needs to be dealt with eventually.

Why? The 2xers do not care about block size, they believe that segwit is all that matters. Once segwit and atomic swaps and the lightning network become a thing, then bitcoin is no longer the main highway. 
What will the main highways be in segwit/atomic swap land?
Litecoin, vertcoin, and every other crypto that merges with bitcoin.

Segwit + lightning on bitcoin is causing vertcoin and litecoin to go up, not bitcoin. Bitcoin will start going up once vertcoin and litecoin merge via atomic swaps with bitcoin, because they will drive transaction fees into the 1-2 penny level. Vertcoin and litecoin already have atomic swaps and lightning ready, all they need now is bitcoin.
vertcoin +60% in 1 day. Within 1 hour of segwit announcement
litecoin + 20% in 1 day. Within 1 hour of segwit announcement

Genesis mining report:
Date bought: 08/20/2017
Amount bought:  22.500 TH/s
Money value: around 2600 dollars
Total money returned as of 9/5/2017:$352
Most common daily return value: around $20ish give or take 40 cents.
On track to receive $7300 by end of year. 
Costs: 2600 for the 20th/s, and 340ish for the 2.5th/s. 
Worries: blockchain halving and difficulty adjustments.
Halving ETA sometime in summer of 2020 (3 years away)
difficulty- 590-&gt; 620 over my time in. That is a decrease in efficiency of 5% over a month.
That means that every month, I will get 5% less than my payout. This means that my true payout is closer to 5500 dollars. 
Projecting at a 5% loss due to difficulty adjustments per month, over 3 years the contract will pay out just short of $11,000 Not bad for 2600 dollars. Now, this is not factoring price swings in bitcoin during that time. 
If bitcoin crashes to 2,000, I will make only 5k. However, if bitcoin moons to 10k, I will be sitting on 25k. Yay!
Cloud mining is still the cheapest way to obtain bitcoins short of buying your own mining rig. 
If you choose to use genesis, please use my code? I get a teeny bit of extra hashpower, and you get a 3% discount. Sz4tDo
Last note to those of you who are naysaying cloud mining and calling it a scam. Genesis is fleecing people who are too lazy to setup their own miners or don't have cheap power for said miners. The agreement they have set up basically gives them free equipment to take care of and run. They run the equipment and charge a significant amount in fees!
The other option for cloud miners is to go with a bank for financing large mining farms, but that means they have to repay the loan, with interest. If bitcoin crashes, they are out of luck. Mining is extremely risky if you have a $100k+ loan hanging over your head, and the crowd payment model gives genesis a solid income stream without risk of loan repayment, because the loan repayment in terms of payouts of bitcoin are tied to the market, not another currency.

1200-1500 is my price range. If it drops below 1500, I won't buy immediately. If it starts to recover, I will be paying close attention, and at if it crosses 1500 going up, i'm buying. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:08:32
Bitcoin is going to hit 1200, perhaps lower. Why? The highest month long sustained average is 2400-2500ish. Yes, it spike to 3,000 but I am talking months.
Bitcoin will hardfork. Uasf is locked in. Miners are locked in. Nobody will cooperate and bitcoin is going to split in HALF. This is the source of the fear, uncertainty and dismay. A half split is at worst a 50/50 split. This means that now there are double the coins in circulation because transactions can be spent on one chain and another.
This means that bitcoins total worth is now half of what its high point was.
Add to that the fact that most people do not know what the scenario is, and are frightened but do not understand what is happening. This further depresses the value.
Now, is a 50/50 split likely? No, not long term. I think a 70/30 or even a 90/10 split is likely, but in the short term, what people are holding may be only worth 1,200 and when people realize that they cant cash out of their bitcoin without losing it, they will feel like they are trapped in a sinking elevator that is on fire. They want off the elevator, and they want off now. That is why it is going to 1200 or less in my opinion.
Interestingly, litecoin has been eating up marketshare, it is up by 6% in terms of ltcbtc, and up .14% in terms of ltcusd. 
Litecoin may well be able to devour bitcoins value, as investors realize that it has something of a parachute in terms of value.
So, where do I see rebounds on the trend? I think it will rebound at or slightly below 1775, go back up to 1850, and continue going down hard. This prediction was made 7/16 4:08 pm, so chart check me on this.

Hash the diploma, and store the hash on the blockchain. If anyone attempts to manipulate the documents, the hash will show that they attempted to manipulate the document...

Look at that. Aside from several major events which can be mapped to dates when exchanges were down, their prices are not moving together. Even when they do move together, the percentage movement is insulated. IE when bitcoin drops 20%, litecoin drops 4%. To me, that is a decoupling, and the only times they move together is when an outside force like exchanges going down hits both of them. 
So shut it. They are decoupled.

Sell them, buy litecoin or ethereum, and put the coins on a wallet on your pc. Why? Litecoin is already activated segwit, it is pushing the lightning network, and it is implementing atomic swaps. Also, it has been decoupling from the bitcoin price.
That means that when bitcoin goes crazy up and down in the coming chain wars, litecoin will be stable, or it will go up. Etherum is premined, and mostly held by devs, also it has no cap, but its future is bright as a contract coin. It is not a good long term store of value like litecoin, and it is more volatile, but it will probably weather the chain war just fine. 
Afterwards, you can swap back to bitcoin, and probably make a tidy profit while you are at it. By tidy profit, I am talking 15-20%. 
The two options are that segwit happens, or that it does not happen. If segwit does not happen, scaling issues and forks going up and up in size are guaranteed. If segwit DOES happen, that means the next thing is lightning network, and atomic swaps. Atomic swaps would allow for swapping bitcoins&lt;-&gt;litecoins without an exchange. Cross chain trading. That means that litecoin is now going to be able to play with bitcoin, and functionally, the two currencies would be the same thing. This means that if you bought into litecoin, and segwit happens, it will merge into part of bitcoin. If you buy litecoin, and segwit does NOT happen, then you will be in a network that is insulated and safe. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:45:56

@_date: 2017-06-17 16:23:17
Lightning offers an exponential modifier to any scaling that does occur to blockchain. If you do lightning, and then double the blocksize, you get the transaction volume squared, rather than transaction volume doubled.
