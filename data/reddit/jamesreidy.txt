I couldn't agree more. There are a number of exciting new technologies being worked on that are standing on the shoulders of the giant that is Satoshi's Blockchain. To me this isn't BTC vs the new comers it's Crypto vs the Incumbents. The battle is for the ownership of wealth. The Incumbent system wants to own all the wealth and license its use to the public. Crypto wants the public to own their own wealth. 
We can hedge with Crypto and they can hedge with legislated bail-ins.

Have you ever tried to explain Bitcoin to someone so entrenched in the current system that they refuse to do even the most basic due diligence and just dismiss it out of hand as an, "Unbacked faith based get rich quick scheme"?
We know how you feel.

When Bitcoin was first gaining popularity in the press articles mentioned, "Attack of the Clones". At the time I didn't think it likely and then it happened: hundreds and hundreds of minor forks claiming to be the best thing ever.
Your scepticism is quite understandable.

Decentralized exchanges need to be the way forward. As market cap of crypto grows centralized exchanges will just become more and more of a target for hackers both internal and external.
This looks a lot like the issue Bitshares is looking to solve. With services like Metaexchange getting into and out of the market exchange is one more step than a centralized exchange but there's no counter party risk since it's a flow through transaction.
It makes me very happy to see people starting to think about this type of thing.
