Many people have been saying Mt Gox is insolvent for weeks now; if Gox were solvent, they could *prove* it, and would have every reason to do so; yet Mt Gox has not even *claimed* to be solvent. When asked directly about their solvency, they replied that it was "confidential". They've been stringing the community along with delay after delay, placing blame on everyone else.
I'd say there's a lot more evidence that Mt Gox is insolvent than that's it's in the black.

Your math is wrong though; it doesn't even take the expectation to be defied as an input. You've maximized the minimum, which finds Satoshi's strategy when his opponents pick their strategy with complete information (i.e. knowing which strategy he has picked). There is no reason to assume the opponents know Satoshi's chosen strategy.
In your model, if Satoshi is maximizing the time until he is found, he should choose *α* = 1 - *β*. Intuitively, this has some reasonable properties: if everyone is sure he would not pick strategy *a*, he should pick strategy *a*. However, there's still an obvious oddity: his strategy is not a function of *p*. This is because of the chosen model, in which seekers pick one strategy unanimously and stick to it.
Let's see if we can modify the model and find the threshold for changing strategies, given *β* and *p*. *p* remains the proportion of people with the name assumed in strategy *a*. Let *β* be the proportion of people assuming he has chosen strategy *a*.
For simplicity, let us assume perfect coordination between seekers^(*). If he chooses strategy *a*, the time taken to find him is proportional to *p*/*β*. If he chooses the other strategy, the time taken to find him is proportional to (1-*p*)/(1-*β*). To find the point where these strategies cross, we set them equal: *p*/*β* = (1-*p*)/(1-*β*). Simplifying: *p* = *β*. That is, he wants to be in the SN population if the proportion of SN-seekers to SN-population is lower than the proportion of !SN-seekers to !SN-population.
^(*)Imperfect coordination would obviously bias the strategy towards being in the larger name pool. To find an upper bound on this bias, let us examine the case of no coordination: every time unit, each seeker examines one member of their chosen population at random. In this model, let *P* be the total population under examination. The probability of not having been found at time *t* given strategy *a* is: (1-1/*pP*)^*βt*. Given strategy !a: (1-1/(1-*p*)*P*)^*(1-β)t*. Setting them equal to find the crossing point, we get *β* = 1 / (log (1-1/(Pp)) / log (1-1/(P(1-p))) + 1). Plugging in P=7x10^9 and solving for the region where this differs from the simplified model by more than 1%, we get *pP*&lt;50. So the simplified model yields the correct strategy threshold to within 1% as long as there are at least 50 people in the SN-population. It's within 5% with pP &gt;= 11. Given that the correct value would be between the coordinated case and the independent case, the much simpler math of the perfect coordination case is a decent approximation.

If multiple outputs go to the same address, either you've reused the address or someone sent you a silly transaction.

I don't mean to be mean, but someone could easily lose their bitcoins trying to follow your procedure. As long as you follow basic security precautions (especially, don't use a brainwallet with short or non-random key, and be careful what you run on your computer), it's a lot easier to lose access to your wallet than to have it stolen.
You wouldn't need to use Electrum necessarily, but a wallet corresponding to a BIP-32 or Electrum random-word seed is fairly easy to keep safe (memorize the seed, keep an encrypted backup somewhere safe). Various tools would work, but an easy option would be to use Electrum to generate the keys. You wouldn't need to connect to Electrum's servers at all (it generates the seed-words and keys client side).

Each input has its own scriptSig, which usually signs (almost) the entire transaction. If multiple inputs to a transaction are signed with the same key, they still require separate signatures because they are each authorizing spends of different inputs.

A bitcoin address is derived is derived from a private key. The private key is what you need to spend money that has been sent to that address. A brainwallet is a private key generated from a phrase. OP has given hints about a brainwallet phrase, and we are guessing phrases to see if they produce the private key that produces the address of OP's reward. There are many possible phrases meeting OP's parameters, so we're writing software to try many phrases successively. When someone finds the phrase, they'll be able to generate the private key and take the coins.

In a lot of cases m-of-n transactions can help with this - the buyer and seller create a 2-of-2 address (or 2-of-3 if they're agreeing on an arbiter to settle disputes), the buyer transfers the funds to that address in advance, and then once the seller delivers the buyer can provide their signature to release the funds; as soon as the seller has that signature, they're guaranteed to receive the funds.

The differences in physical properties between gold and silver don't affect their utility as stores of value as much as the differences between altcoins can affect their utility as media of exchange.
Altcoins do compete with Bitcoin for demand, although once they reach something like a price equilibrium between each other they won't continue causing inflation. Altcoins inflate Bitcoin while they're being adopted. I don't think it's likely that new altcoins will continue to emerge and gain major market share indefinitely.

I like that, it eliminates the problem of knowing whether a value is supposed to be in BTC or mBTC, which is really awkward in some situations (e.g. command-line utils).

The safest way is to keep them in an m-of-n address, store different private keys in different media, and decide how many keys to make and how many keys to require based on perceived risk of losing a key vs. perceived risk of key compromise. A simple form: one key is based on a passphrase, one key is on paper at a friend's house, one key is on your phone, one key is on a CD, one key is in the cloud, require 3 of the 5. Forget your passphrase? CD+phone+cloud. House burns down with all your belongings? Passphrase+friend+cloud. Friend not actually your friend? You're fine unless they take your phone and find the CD.

When the reason to invest is making return off future investors, it's a Ponzi scheme. I think (hope!) we'll see less of that as the cryptocurrency space matures.


The thing is though, we only need one cryptocurrency, any working cryptocurrency, to be able to do *anything* in a layer on top of it. There are already a bunch of candidates for such layers for various purposes, e.g. advanced transactions like m-of-n (allow for escrow, bonding), colored coins (allow for representing fiat in the blockchain and exchanging them atomically, stocks, ripple-like systems,...), Open-Transactions (allow for all of the above with instant transactions, cheques, checks, cashiers checks, custom contracts, extendible to probably anything), and one more I won't name (but that one's funded like a Ponzi scheme, obscenely complex, and bakes into the code a flawed understanding of economics). So once Bitcoin, or its successor if it fails (probably due to centralization around ASICs), becomes well-established enough, there's no need for others.
