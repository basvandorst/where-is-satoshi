I'm buying everything I can right now. Keep the price crashing.

I made the mistake of using an Android BTC wallet that appears to keep trying for me. The creator said it's my fault for choosing "economic" when in reality that option shouldn't exist.

I've had a send processing for like three weeks. I way under payed, but not zero. I'm pretty sure it's gone forever.

Why did he do that? It's really annoying.

Fear? I'm a huge fan of crypto. But this is madness. There's not an extra trillion dollars laying around to sustain a market cap with $100k/BTC. Anyone who buys in now is doing it for novelty. No one should be mortgaging houses and dropping real money.

I cashed out 90% at $1k, and the rest at $8k. You all are insane holding into $20k. I hope it keeps climbing. It won't. If BTC is over $10k this time next year, I'll chug a half gallon of eggnog on live stream.

Years long wait lists where all the good stuff is sold on eBay for 10x "retail."

Dude, you're looking at my drunk typing too deeply.

Limited in the sense that Republicans do. They want limited government when it comes to their guns and money, but not abortion, drugs, and monopolies.
Libertarianism sounds fine on paper, but it's just a sophisticated form of Capitalism. It ultimately leads to the rich herding the poor and buying your liberty, at fair market value.

They didn't have to tell me.

Who pays for the laws? Or rather who enforces the laws? Am I to pay a private police company to arrest me in the event I violate a person's or personhood's corporate rights? Freeeeeee Market! WOOOOO FUCK YOU I GOT MINE!!!!

My example may have been exaggerated, but the point is small town sheriffs are as likely to be corrupt as any politician. The difference is without a hand of god, the federal government, no one could stop them. When the federal government becomes overly corrupt either a revolution happens, or another outside entity takes its place. Compartmentalising a nation just isn't feasible. It would make a whole lot more sense to just bust up the US and make 5 or 10 new countries.

Bitcoin deposits for payroll.

Who makes sure those local laws are fair? How would I say... keep myself from being arrest for snorting heroine in Texas, while on a road trip, when it's perfectly legal in my home state of Massachusetts? Or am I supposed to know every legal system for each city of each state as I cross the continent formerly known as the United States?

If you actually need help selling them, I'll type directions. If you're a troll, ignore me.

You do like most reasonable people. Find a price you're willing to lose, purchase at fixed intervals. Stop when you've met your goal. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:02:36
No biggie. That's only $6,000,000 these days. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:17:26
So what you're telling us is that Bitcoin isn't anonymous and Coinbase can follow your spending even if you drop it into an intermediate wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:19:21
Just a heads up. Prices are about to hit 10k by January 15th. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:39:19
You do realize at peak, that was over $1,000,000?
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:52:50
It's only up 1000% over the last year. That's pretty dismal. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:09:57
Meh, I dumped at $300 for a 30% profit. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:08:00
Yesterday I took half my BTC at $2,400 and put it into ETH. They both went up about 10% since.

I enjoy his show, but he picks low hanging fruit and deliberately misrepresents the other side of many of his arguments, effectively creating a strawman argument.
