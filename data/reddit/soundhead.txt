This "subreddit" consists simply of links to an external ad supported site. Apart from being poorly executed, I'm sure this must violate Reddit's terms and conditions?

No. Stay well clear of any sites offering BTC at any kind of discount. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:21:05
If you do a lot of transactions then additional change addresses are created on demand (I think). This is why it is important to do regular backups to pick up any newly created change addresses. 
If you do more than 100 transactions and then try to restore from an old backup, the backup won't contain the newly created address and your wallet balance won't include the coins for that address.

It isn't fake. It's basically gambling, but not fake. I was sceptical but a response from their friendly support team to a query and the fact that a lot if work has gone into the site convinced me otherwise. I won too, not $1k but enough to make it worth the time. Of course, I could have just as easily lost the $35 I put it.

Have to say - after the demise of BitInnovate, I was somewhat sceptical about using your service. After an initial hiccup (had to wait 3 days for BTC delivery), you have been awesome. Keep it up!

Fair enough, the Stage 1 comment is pure speculation on my part. 
However, as a threat it does exist - if I were Amazon I'd certainly be extremely attracted to the idea of being in control of a defacto Internet currency. Success brings competitors and the recent media hype surrounding bitcoins would have gotten the business world thinking. Personally, I don't see how the likes of Litecoins, Namecoins etc can catch up with Bitcoins because at the end of the day, they don't offer the users any real advantages but Amazon does have a massive advantage - its name and infrastructure.

This has been tried over and over again - sell a load of coins, DDOS the main trading sites, post "the end of the world is coming" type messages in forums and wait for the bystanders to panic and sell off their coins and then the perpetrators buy them back up on the cheap.
But recently it has become less and less effective a strategy. Not sure if people are just wising up or if the short term speculative money has left the markets.

Not entirely true. According to this:  70-odd Jalapenos have been delivered and according to this:  some more have just gone out.
But it is true that they still have thousands of orders to process.

For example, persuade someone who knows what they are talking about to give an introductory talk on Bitcoins and how it can help their small business/restaurant/bar etc. Or get the BitInnovate crew to come along and talk about their service - they're based in Sydney I think.

My economics is rusty and I don't want to put a dampener on things but one thing that always bothers me about these calculations is that they seem to ignore the fact that a bitcoin can be used over and over again, in the same way that a dollar note could be used, say a thousand times in a year.
I think it is wrong to compare a Flow (GDP) to a Stock (number of bitcoins). I think you should be comparing GDP to (Number of Bitcoins) x (Number of Times Bitcoins Used/Year). Since bitcoins can be so easily be transferred from one person to another, each bitcoin could be used in many thousands of transactions every year.
Of course, this would suggest a MUCH lower expected value than $427.

I've used BitInnovate a number of times to *buy* coins with no problems at all. Quick and reliable service. I'd trust them with selling my coins too.
I contacted them a couple of days ago about their SSL certificate and their response was:
"Thanks for letting us know. It seems to be a configuration problem we've had since we scaled up our system. We have a fix but haven't fully rolled it out due to everything going on with Bitcoin over the last few weeks. "

I suspect (and this is just a guess), that the market is stuck in some kind of feedback loop. Day traders need volatility to make money and in turn their trading creates more volatility. Since news has been relatively quiet of late, volatility has declined, leading to less day trading, leading to less volatility etc. But... just a guess. If this is true it will require a kick start to get going again, either (as you suggest) some major trades or some major news.

When you send bitcoins from your wallet (in your case to Vicurex), the remainder is sent to a change address (the extra address you see on Blockchain). This change address is created by Bitcoin-QT.
EDIT: Just to clarify, don't panic, you are not using a hacked version of Bitcoin-Qt, the coins are there, the balance shown is correct but the remaining coins are saved against the change address in your wallet, not the original address. This confused the hell out of me as well.

I use these guys in Australia: 
They will sell $5K worth per customer per day.
However, they charge a 7.9% premium over the current MtGox rate but without the hassle of having to get your AUD funds in (which costs 3% I think through a service called Technocash).
There is also  but I haven't used them before.

AFAIK, the story is this:
1. He failed to sell off the 20m shares in the initial offering.
2. Subsequently, he would offload a couple of hundred thousand shares at 0.0005 every so often.
3. Speculators complained that this was removing any opportunity to make money.
4. So Kenneth started selling off shares in batches at a steadily increasing price to allow early investors to sell at a profit (and also raise more investment funds for AMC).
5. Other people complained to Bitfunder that he was artificially driving up the price and they should be allowed to buy shares at the original offer price of 0.0005. They agreed.

I'd like somewhere in Sydney that accepted BTC too but I can't find anywhere. I suppose the best idea is to approach some venues to get the ball rolling. I bet some of the Newtown restaurants would be keen.

Not qualified to comment on solving the issue or whether it is a good or bad thing, but as an ex-Economics graduate, it's a fascinating example of industrialisation: from cottage industry (CPU mining) to factory production (rigs) to large scale shareholder owned enterprises (AsicM and ActiveMining), all within a couple of years. I'm sure the story will end up in a textbook one day.

I've bought $1000 worth of BTC off them over the past couple of months with no problems. If you're worried about direct bank transfers and the possibility of the powers that be tracking you (I don't - I pay my taxes on my BTC investments), you can always deposit the funds via a cash deposit into their account.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:24:28
This a reason why I always use BitInnovate to buy coins in Australia. Yes, you pay a hefty premium (7.99%) but because the transaction is done by depositing cash directly into their account, there is no record on my end other than a confirmation email. Omnicoins work in the same way.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:23:19
1. This is just stage 1. 
2. Amazon is the World's largest Internet retailer.
I've always thought that the biggest threat to Bitcoins would be an alternative crypto currency backed by a well known financial services company or retailer. Like it or not, the average man or woman in the street is much more like to sign up to a currency stamped with a familiar name.
@_date: 2013-05-31 08:50:24
Perhaps include BTC to $ conversion based on recent price to make it easier to compare Cost/GHs etc?
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:02:32
There is a real dichotomy between the role of Bitcoin as a decentralised currency helping to take the power away from the few and Bitcoin mining, which is basically a money making process. Any enterprise that exists to make money and where there exist economies of scale (chip manufacturing, power costs) will end up becoming centralised. It's inevitable. 
Edit: Spelling.

Your question prompted me to finally create a reddit account, instead of just lurking here every day.
I'm new to Bitcoins, but I have used bitinnovate three times over the past few weeks and I have been very pleased with their service. The coins usually appear within 20 minutes or so of depositing the money. My only complaint is their expensive fees (7.9%), however, this is offset somewhat by the fixed pricing they employ - every time so far, I've placed an order at one price and by the time the order is actually processed, the price has risen. Of course I've been lucky so far and this would also work in reverse...
Other options include: 
-  - they seem to charge a similar mark up to Bitinnovate (7.7% according to my calculations) although this markup is included in the higher quoted price rather than as a separate fee.
- Mt Gox using Technocash to transfer the funds. This is cheaper and I understand that you can deposit funds into Technocash from an Australian Post Office. However, I prefer the simplicity of using Bitinnovate.
Haven't tried either of these yet, although I'm waiting on verification by My Gox. Bitinnovate have a $5k limit on trades so if you're looking to offload a lot of bitcoins in a hurry, an Mt Gox account might be a useful backup.
@_date: 2013-07-08 09:21:48

He set up a trading software start up for trading virtual securities and currencies before getting into broadcasting and hence is very familiar with the Bitcoin idea. He has been promoting Bitcoins for a long time.

No. Enterprises will generally go for maximum profits, not operate at maximum efficiency. ASICMiner operating at 18.2% of the total will still make more money than operating at 10%. As other people have said, however, ASICMiner have held off dominating the total hash rate to avoid spooking the market.
Secondly, economies of scale will favour those miners that can produce their own chips and as difficulty rises, the cost of power will once again become a major factor - again favouring larger scale operations (who can negotiate cheaper power rates).
Therefore, mining will probably become centralized amongst a few large combined chip manufacturing and mining operations.

Yes. You haven't lost your Bitcoins. I went through exactly the same process you did and came to the same conclusion. It was after some more research that I worked out what was going on.
When Bitcoin-Qt is installed, it creates a pool of 100 change addresses, which are normally hidden from view. There is a command to list these addresses from the Debug window (Help menu, Debug) but I can't seem to find it. You can, however, view your unspent coins by entering the **listunspent** command.
One tip: you should encrypt your wallet (Settings menu, Encrypt wallet). **Make sure you don't lose the encryption phrase**.
