Also a good one. But, not true.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:28
I've never been high in my life!

They are selling at $8,200 + $4 fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:20:12
Should be $7,294

How does the in person transfer work?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:11:40
Drivers license and SSN, etc? I’m on my way to have a new DL made because my image is blurred and scratched up.

How will funds be transferred? Wire to GDAX?

Glidera is currently reviewing my account information...

The text message support employee said, “We have a spread in place so one Bitcoin at the ATM will be priced higher than the average market price. Just like when you convert foreign currencies. This is how we make a profit and keep the ATMs running.”

No! It’s just a scenario. Like, one that I just thought of. I can’t predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:14:07
It is a frightening scenario to think about... I’m not an advocate for a complete collapse. But, hopefully the US government will learn from this “scare” that we’re all fueling.

Is there identity verification?
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:23:43
CONGRATS! I'm planning to be there in 2 years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:23:32
I’m being optimistic.

I stayed up from 8:00 pm Wednesday until about 4:00 PM Thursday. My first all-nighter since forgetting about that final exam in college. 
This has the potential to be a GAME-CHANGER, and excites me very much. 
The one thing I'm not happy with is the amount of shitty websites claiming that you can purchase BTC and actually receive BTC. I've signed up for too many websites and still haven't been able to purchase anything.

Their phone number, 484-800-1675, is not in service or maybe no one was home to pick up...

Hm ok. I’ve read horror stories about Coinbase freezing transactions and taking weeks to complete transactions. I’m scared to use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:11:49
The NEW 1% :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:56:42
I'm REALLY angry that I didn't think about creating this website. +1 to you, Karmaa. Hope that ad revenue can help with investing in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:10:50
I’m not able to verify my bank account or debit card on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:56:50
Oh well!
