So then why did GBTC announce a distribution method to sell their segwit tokens and return the value to shareholders?  There are segwit 2x tokens as a result of the blockchain fork on December 28th.

It was just a press release from Grayscale in reference to shareholders of GBTC.  Said they were going to sell the segwit2x tokens if possible.  Sounds like it may not be possible.

It's variable, look at the book orders, look at the current price. Look at whatever current price +1% is on the sell order side.  It tells you the number of bitcoins you can buy at that price.  If you executed that buy order, the price would shift to that immediately as you would fill all sell orders below that price.  Currently btc is 11190, 1% up is like 11300.  According to gdax, you'd have to buy 350 btc to fill all sell orders below 11300.

So I'm kind of ignorant, but, does the lightning network require a new coin like segwit2x?  Or is it not a fork at all, just a different program in additional to the bitcoin program?

then what are segwit2x tokens?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:35:32
Ahh OK.  Thanks!  I see people saying segwit 100% around here too, as opposed to 2x, will that also eventually be another layer or a hard fork?

GBTC also carries a premium that usually gets more expensive when bitcoin is rising, so GBTC can actually outpace BTC in bull runs, making it even more detached when trying to get BTC price from GBTC.
