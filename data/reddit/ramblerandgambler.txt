So are the cash to btc atms simply profiting from charges or are they banking on the btc losing value?
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:18:18
how do you mean? 
I assume they didn't invent it?

That was my understanding. I did not investigate. The chain is called 'petrol', seems to be a government chain.

There is value in the 'brand' bitcoin has, stores (online and bricks and mortar stores) accept bitcoin, that has value. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:50:58
that's how i got started, a guy sent me a dollar on Changetip after I asked a question in this sub about how to get started and then I set up a wallet to 'cash it' and then I bought a whole coin, it was under $200 at that stage.

You mean in the thread or in reply to this comment? My app is being weird

What makes you so sure that it will go over $1000 again soon(ish)? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:11:18
A year or two.
Or when it doubles in value, convert the principal to fiat and let the rest ride.
Whichever comes first.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:41:00
Then like any investment I'll have lost money and I'd eat it. If it's below 50% of when I bought in, I'd probably just leave it and see where it goes.
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:02:45
I have coin base as an option also, have you ever used them to convert to paypal?
I am based in london. Any two way ATMs i can find charge 5% commission to withdraw, looking for better option.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:07:55
Thanks for reply.
If that's the case, and you and i know that, why isn't price steadily rising? 
If you were to put money on it (har har), when do you think we'll see the price hit 1000 again?
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:15:12
Have you checked for bitcoin ATMs in your area?

how much could you mine per week/month with a setup like that? 
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:19:56
good question, I'd also like an answer to this. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:02:47
Things won't change until people have that mentality. Same thing happened with Debit cards int he last ten years (in Europe at least, can't speak for US), if i ran a shop and three people a week asked me "Do you accept bitcoin?" I might start looking into how it works
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:09:29

OP has lost a thousand and is still excited.

Old people built the atom bomb, old people put us on the moon, and most importantly they've managed to stay alive, I'd trust an old person to be smarter than a college kid until they prove otherwise.
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:37:43
let's say they sell for close to market rate, how will this affect prices?

this guy has hidden some bitcoin somewhere (probably a piece of paper with a number on it), you can use the number he posted above to see when someone has found it because they will transfer it
