Please say this is a joke

Bitcoin futures won’t effect the day to day price of bitcoin as they aren’t purchasing any of the actual coins. They’re betting on the price being higher or lower and paid cash at the end of the day.
I think a lot of people need to know that fact.

Amen to that. 
I tried my arm at being a smart arse and second guessing the market. Guess what? It bit me in the backside and now I just appreciate the gains I’m getting by just sitting on what I already have. 
This market breeds greed. You see a coin go up 30% in a day and you think “I KNEW I SHOULD OF INVESTED IN THAT YESTERDAY”. Meanwhile, my litecoin has gone up over a thousand percent in a year. But it had 2 months sitting around $60 so I wanted MORE. Ridiculous way of thinking and I’m glad I had the ability to see my own foolishness before it ruined me.

Just broke the 8100 as well. I think a correction will do us all the world of good.

The minimum you should put in is the maximum amount you are comfortable kissing goodbye to in the event of a collapse. Easy.

Why do all these YouTube vloggers have a really fucking annoying cut out of them pulling a stupid face on the thumbnails? I just skip straight by it if I see them.

Thank you

My god, now that’s a face you would love to smack.

The problem is, a lot of people don’t understand that there are a hell of a lot more losers in trading than there are winners. It is impossible for everyone to get rich. 
Buy and sell are the only trade options you have. A winner and a loser.

Speak to an accountant who specialises in this field, not reddit. If you’ve really got 3 million bucks to your name, don’t be such a tight arse. They will save you more money than you will spend on their fee for solicitation.

Don’t do it

As long as your brand of hardware wallet supports the specific coin wallets, yes.

Cold wallet, patience, don’t think you’re smarter than the market, only invest what you’re willing to lose. That is it.

I completely agree and your argument is one hundred percent valid. 
The post was meant in jest. A slight tickle of support. I too remember that feeling of sickness at losing a trade so can completely empathise.
