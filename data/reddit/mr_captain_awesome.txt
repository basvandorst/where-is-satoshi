Is there anyway to avoid high fees?

you don't need your bank account to fund your coinbase account with USD in order do limit orders on GDAX; you can also use your debit card. just keep in mind though debit purchases are instant, they are limited to how much bitcoin you can purchase depending on the debit card you're using so ymmv. if you have concerns about security, set up two-factor authentication, only deposit the amount you're going to purchase, place your limit order on GDAX then move your bitcoin to a hardware wallet.

I asked a similar question [here]( and these were the responses.

Sorry, I missed those specifics. You cannot fund USD without a bank account on Coinbase.

Just to be clear, you can only buy Bitcoin; not fund USD into your Coinbase account using your credit/debit card.  
On Coinbase, use your credit/debit card to buy Bitcoin. Then go on to GDAX, select deposit on the far left. Next select Coinbase Account and select BTC Wallet as your as your source. Your Bitcoin will be available instantly for you to place your limit order.

go to coinbase &gt; settings &gt; link accounts &gt; link new account. there you should see the following options to fund your account: bank account, credit/debit card, wire transfer

I too am seeking answers. I was using Coinbase as a baseline for the current price of bitcoin. As of this writing, Cointracking reporting the value of Bitcoin as $13,648, where Coinbase/GDAX is $14,397.
