Your videos are extremely compelling, I haven't seen any other trading bot program show real time results like that. Yes I crunched the numbers, your ROI over the last 3 days is pretty damn good. OK it's rediculous, if you didn't show it real-time it wouldn't be beleived. Can that be an expected average, especially since it's a down market right now, and it might even make more money (better trades) if it soars back up?
So would my BTC really be trading all day and night completely hands free without you entering the orders, or is it just making suggestions for you to act upon and still requires you to enter the next set or batch of orders? In other words, how do I know you aren't just watching the market in those videos and taking action yourself?
I assume the lack of fees is standard - Is that some type of promotion ran by that Exchange, or do you really make all those trades without any fees? And will that continue throughout for all of my trades?
I woud like to proceed with a small amount for a trial period. I choose the time period, I choose the amount. I hope that can work for you.

I've been doing my research and agree the bull run is over or at least delayed until I want to enter a hold strategy again. I've done my research and have a few questions:
 - How is your algorithm / trading platform different from those on the market?
 - How exactly does your program work - Is it an "API"? Do I need to know anything about the functionality of it?
 - Do I retian any type of control over the trading account, or any visibility to what's going on with my Bitcoin?
