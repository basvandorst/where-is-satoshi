A few Wall Street whales will dip toes in. 
In three years: $100k
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:07:22
When Wall Street money gets in, the price will soar past $10k quickly. 
As soon as a big fund or investor (billionaire) takes a position, OR an ETF becomes available that allows funds to take a position without literally buying and storing bitcoins, the floodgates will open. 
Gentlemen your task is to accumulate 100 bitcoins by any means necessary.  They will be worth over $1 million very soon...and then a literal fortune five years after that. I mean generational wealth.

It immediately dropped from around $130 to $100, and everyone was very freaked out. This was the immedate response to SR getting shut down.  
Then it recovered...and went higher...and then China invested heavily. Price hit $1200.
Go back and look at the charts.

Simple supply and demand.  A tiny fraction of the population owns even a single satoshi. 
Hell for wealth storage and the transfer of large offshore accounts alone, it's worth 100x what it is today. 
The value of all existing bitcoins is only $10 billion.  There are several hundred individuals who have much money, and thousands of investment funds, corporations and governments. If just a few buy a bunch, the rest must needs follow or they risk getting left in the dark and possibly swallowed by a newly rich(er) entity. 
It is going to happen.

@_date: 2014-02-05 17:11:48
It's a 3rd party verification service.  They do a credit check to ensure that you are who you say you are, similar to when you apply for a credit card or bank account online, and they ask you multiple choice questions about "Which of these streets have you lived on?" etc.  
It's legit.  
Once you have a miicard, you can use it on other sites that require that level of verification.  Not sure what those ARE, but I hear there are some others, and will be more.

How will the value of this ETF track with the value of actual bitcoin?  
Just because there is a lot (or little) of demand for the ETF's shares, does that automatically mean that bitcoin itself would go up in value?
Could we see shares of this ETF be $1500, while bitcoin is still $750

Only one has been even marginally successful: Labcoin.  And even that has been only a mild increase.

Correct. It will never drop 70-90% ever again.

There's the early adopters who have been in for years.  That's everyone before 2013.  That is a VERY SMALL % of people in this world.  These are the Early Adopters.  They will all be very rich, if they aren't already.  
Then there are people who have gotten in since 2013.  It's a lot more folks, probably 100x as many as the Early Adopters.  This is my group.  We are the Believers. This group may have made or lost a little so far, depending one wher they bought in (somewhere between $50 and $250).  These folks are being tested right now.  We're not seeing the straspheric gains we were hoping for, but we believe that bitcoins could become a very powerful reserve global currency, with a value anywhere between $1,000 to $400,000 per bitcoin sometime in the next 10 years.
This is just my rough guess, but I would wager that less than 1% of the world has heard of bitcoin, and less than 1% of those own even a fraction of 1 bitcoin.  And probably only 1% of bitcoin owners have more than 10 bitcoins.
My point here is that IF bitcoin becomes a gold-like reserve currency, and is actually exchanged around the globe, and most folks have some amount of bitcoins, or mBits...well, then Early Adopters will be on the Forbes Billionaire Lists, and Believers like me will have a very comfortable life (equivalent of a person with $3mil in the bank right now).
Personally I predict that 1 BTC will have the modern equivalent of $10,000 worth of buying power in ten years.

Well you and I and other first adopters know that, but 95% of people just let their brokers, IRAs, 401ks, mutual funds and pension funds handle their investing, and those folks are way more comfortable with things that fit neatly into their concept of investing in stocks and bonds. 
I'm all for letting them get exposure to bitcoin through an ETF, but I would never buy into it myself.  Just like I'd never buy GLD or SLV instead of the literal metals themselves.

Well that would make every early adopter a multi-millionaire overnight, so it will certainly be popular here.
I feel like it's a matter of time before a tipping point is reached.  Enough companies will use bitcoin and then suddenly it will be a standard thing, and then it will really take off.

It can definitely effect my mood, and suddenly I'm checking the prices every 2 minutes. After two straight perfectly AWFUL times where I sold at the bottom and then rebought at a loss of about 5 BTC I have sworn off trying to play those swings. 
I just have 90% invested in various bitcoin stocks (asicminer, 100th, Kenilworth, etc) to help deter me from panicking and dumping everything when it dips below 100.

@_date: 2013-05-16 04:53:17
This is incorrect.  With CampBX, if you deposit via Dwolla, you can't withdraw CASH via Dwolla for 31 days.
You could definitely send bitcoins over to one of the ASIC markets to by ASICminer shares.

@_date: 2013-07-23 16:53:51
Personally I consider Mt.Gox's price to be the "true" price, because that exchange has to most people trading on it at anyone time, which means that if you had to sell all of your bitcoins at once, that is one of the few places where there's enough people to buy hundreds and hundreds of bitcoins at the going rate.
But in the subjective sense, whichever service you choose to exchange your coins has the "true market price" since that's what you personally will be getting for your coins/dollars.
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:54:50
I think 4 months is when they expect to be able to see SOME increase on value (and dividend payment) but it will take longer than that to see that expected value gain up to the 60s (from 10 BTC).
That said, I have thousands of shares and I hope they literally strike gold.

bit-card.de is PERFECT for this.  And you're in luck - they're housed in Germany.
You can get pre-loaded cards from 100mB to a full 1BTC.
That's what everyone on my Christmas list is getting this year.
I'll include a note explaining how it works, telling them to hide the card for 3 years and then buy me dinner in appreciation when that 1BTC is worth $1000-$5000 in 2017.

The problem is that there's really no "we" in the sense of a big company advertizing a new service.
Seems that it will have to grow by word-of-mouth and the Internet.
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:36:39
I guess that must be it.  But why not just leave your coins in companies that are mining/selling/profiting, so you can get some dividends and share-value growth *at the same time*?

Bitcoin-brokers.org 
Allows you to send your coins to an escrow service  who then advertises them for you.  When a buyer is found, they are sent to a branch of your bank, and they deposit cash into your account.  When you verify the deposit, the buyer gets the coins. 
Costs you $0.

If I have 4 BTC in ASICMINER, and BTC is $100, I have $400 in liquid(able) funds.
If I have 4 BTC in ASICMINER, and BTC shoots up to $200, now I have $800 in liquid(able) funds.
I don't see why a rising bitcoin price is NECESSARILY bad for bitcoin securities.
If people would just leave their BTC in the securities, they could get the best of both worlds: increased value of bitcoin itself, plus share-value and dividends from the security.

Its more of a localbitcoins.com concept, except instead of meeting in person, the buyer makes a deposit to your account at your bank. 
There is no risk in giving out your account # for your bank to anyone. Without your password, they can't get into your online account, and without photo ID they can't make withdrawals in person. 
I like it.

Ok, I just bought a seat.  0.28 BTC.  
When you say "top of the BFI list with 10 x 60 ghs on the way" are you saying they have 10 ASICMINERS en route, so theorhetically they'll be mining a lot more bitcoins in the future, and therefore kicking down to all seatholders in a simple version of a dividend payment?
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:46:18
That's likely it, but still, that's poor marketing strategy.  
Even the little 1-2-3 steps graphic in the app makes no mention of actually BUYING gift cards.

I like to see any show of faith in the Bitcoin community, but since opening a Coinbase account over a month ago I have not been able to do a single transaction with them because they've always "exceeded the daily limit" or whatever.

Its where I keep all of my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:26:45
I'm in on this one
@_date: 2013-07-31 18:00:35
Pretty much the idea is to be able to get your friends up and running with a couple bitcoins quickly, and they just give you cash for it?
The idea needs to be fleshed out, but I like the notion of having something tangible that you can give to a person to walk them through obtaining their first mBTC.
bit-card.de has an easy paper wallet in the form of a standard pre-loaded debit card that can help facilitate this as well.

Ok the money got found and I got the sears.  Problem solved! 
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:08:47
Pretty sweet deals on there
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:42:44
So many bitcoins!

Will BTCT notify shareholders via email when dividends are paid out, or do I need to just keep checking? 
@_date: 2013-09-01 06:33:34
People are very impatient with these bitcoin securities. Very few seem to be long term investors, they're speculators who thrive on news and will jump to the next hot stock in a heartbeat. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 23:36:41
Me neither 
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:20:13
100th on  is also of note 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:59:09
Yup. Right when people need them, they go bone dry. Pathetic. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:07:11
When can you expect to see that dividend? 
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:02:24
How do you like those wallet ones? I have the first ones, in 500 mBTC denominations. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:18:25
Hell YES it would push the price up.  Suddenly there were would be far, far fewer bitcoins available. Supply and demand. 
Its just a fake wall though I'm sure.  (fake meaning that the person with that money will yank the offer back before the purchase goes through. That's how these big whales shove the market around) 
@_date: 2013-09-14 04:29:35
$400,000 in today's purchasing power in 10 years. Just HOLD (or spend and replenish)

The price of the shares is determined by the demand of people trying to buy them. The performance of the company THEORHETICALLY makes price go up, but only if people want to buy the shares. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:52:25
Dividends are only paid to shareholders. 
The dividend is how a company distributes profits to shareholders. 
That's one reason why people buy shares. The other reason is because they believe/hope that the price of the share will go up over time, as more and more people want it (for whatever reason). Then you sell it for more than you bought it -  that's pure profit. 
The goal of course is to spot a low priced share early, earn a bunch of dividends, and then sell it for way more than you paid. 
Then you turn around and do it all again. 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:01:51
Very cool. 
Really hoping they add Target and (yes) Walmart gift cards to the bitcoinable gyft cards soon. Currently you can only add those cards into the app if you have a physical gift card

We're going to feel even better when it's $500 and everyone's 401k has tanked. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:15:23
Have you guys had any trouble with liquidity with these shares? Has there consistently been someone willing to  it when you've wanted to sell? 
Any estimates on how high the share price might be able to go? 
@_date: 2013-10-05 22:36:59
Awesome

 "This way I realize gains when the BTC rises against the dollar and also when the companies that I invest in do well. I recommend it to anyone else holding BTC long term."
Definitely agree, it's a win-win.
@_date: 2013-05-14 01:24:23
I am puzzled at how so many thousands of new accounts are being opened daily, yet the price is relatively stable. 
Is EVERYONE coming in and just day trading back and forth on the small volatility?  It seems unlikely. 
But logically if everyone was was buying, say, 100 coins each, the price would HAVE to rise sharply. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:55:40
I know a ton of very conservative investors who refuse to "gamble" on bitcoin, but if it is available as a stock, they'd probably go for it. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:50:25
My God this bitcoin sexy talk 
@_date: 2013-07-05 21:22:15
My plan is to buy more bitcions.  Just picked up 2.8 for just $200.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:27:50
Can someone explain the significance of this in plain English?
@_date: 2013-07-14 15:06:31
I used it as a buyer last week. Contacted them through the website, received the deposit instructions, and walked over to a Bank of America.  Deposited $200 cash, and less then two hours later I had the bitcoins in my wallet. 
Easy peasy, Japanesey 
@_date: 2013-06-30 01:20:54
Awesome, my patience will be rewarded 
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:18:18
LOL, man once you HAVE the coins there's no tracing them.  No need to "wash" them whatsoever.
The issue is that there is a record of you buying them in the first place, because you had to register and give copies of your license and such on the exchange websites.
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:12:42
I'm all in
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:13:07
Cool, thanks for the heads up.  I'm sure back in August ASICMINER looked pretty obscure to everyone, now if you threw down bank you're a literal millionaire.
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:07:11
Interesting idea. Tell me more

In bitcoin we trust.

There's no AML verification on either side of the transaction. Do some research before you open your pie-hole. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:11:55
Won't it be years and years and years before mining is no longer profitable, assuming that the invention of more efficient technologies (conveniently spear-headed by ASICMINER)? 
I'm not adding ASICMINER to my retirement 401k account here, I"m looking for 1-3 years of awesome performance, and then we'll re-evaluate.
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:52:06
Okay, what's it's going to be today: 6/5/2013?!
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:01:57
I am also giving a few bit-cards too 
@_date: 2013-07-20 06:32:53
Hard to see ASICMINER failing at this point. Regardless of the stock price, they're paying around a 30% APR dividend. It's the greatest "safe" investment in the world right now 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:49:27
Agreed.  It will be like gold - people own maybe one Gold Eagle, not a huge bullion bar.
1 btc will = 1 bullion bar of gold.

I guess *technically* you just can't put collectibles or insurance in your self directed IRA.  
The question is - what IS bitcoin, by IRS standards?  
This is why we NEED the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF, seriously.

An ETF that would allow people to put some of their 401k/IRA investments into bitcoin - even a step removed - would be enormous.

If I want to take on a proposition bet, say "The Red Sox will win the World Series" the odds are not listed in the typical +800 or -150 format of traditional wagering. 
Instead, there are "weights", but I don't know how they relate to odds, and therefore I can't tell if it's a bet worth taking. 
The FAQ gives an explanation that seems to assume that I'm a math whiz, which I assuredly am not. 
Please and thank you. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 23:03:08
Can we (US customers) put in new bitcoins right now, to purchases more shares?

The whole bitcoin stocks world is in flux suddenly.  New players coming in and shaking it up, new IPOs, ActiveMining going up enormously and then losing 60% of its value in a few hours....rollercoaster.
