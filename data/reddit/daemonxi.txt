Why not?

Stop the ad hominem and argue on topic.

The gold standard? Oh man.

Bitcoin is not an investment.

You should plug bitcoin donation in the middle and at the end of an article that long. It might reduce friction and remind your users to donate after they're done reading.
Have you considered putting the price in USD? I have no idea what 0.00001 BTC is nowadays.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:33:05
Congrats, you posted an article with a title bad enough to make me leave @_date: 2014-02-12 09:38:12

If you have a Trojan on someone's computer why would you not just include your code in the Trojan from the start?

haha yeah, Big Bitcoin™ is paying NPR to shill for them

I suppose clarifying why being closed-source doesn't impact your program's security would be a good way of making users feel more secure. I understand where you're coming from now.
@_date: 2012-08-17 07:54:29
Closed source software can't be checked for security flaws.

[$4 for one of these?]( How about [$4 for two of them?](
This stuff isn't competitively priced.

Please don't use the Bitcoin sub to advertise your auctions.
Thank you.

You don't seem to know what you're talking about, and you're not helping me learn. Sorry.
@_date: 2011-06-05 09:50:30
Just curious, what's your mining rate?

No, this happened to me too. I had a MtGox account before the hack, and apparently someone used the leaked details and password information to try to get into my Google account. That's when I realized something was up, and it made sense that the MtGox database had something to do with it.
@_date: 2011-06-11 20:35:10
Ah. I forgot! So that's what the goons think, then.
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:26:00
I think you were downvoted for not adding to the discussion.

[Here's a picture]( of what the forum mods think of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-21 01:39:28
And if you hold onto 10btc and the value doubles, it is a relative gain of 10btc. What's your point?
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:41:56
I'm in Bitcoin long. If Bitcoin rises in value (which I want it to), I lose money and Bridgewalker makes money. Plus the 1.5% transaction fees are not appealing.
I can see this being useful if you like the idea of Bitcoin but don't like the volatility, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-05-06 00:21:02
Hahahaha. You're cute!
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:51:08
Damn, this subreddit likes getting circlejerky.
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:14:01
Then you can delete this post, right?

Not at that scale it doesn't.

It's not very liquid though.

Holy Moses, take it easy there. What kind of stuff?
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:33:11
That's funny, because there are lots of differences between those two.

It's a terrible currency thanks to fluctuations, but you would be hard pressed to find a better way to transfer money worldwide.
