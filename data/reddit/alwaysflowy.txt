I have read this and a couple other articles and I can honestly say this guy just doesn't quite get it. He's almost overeducated in a way because he writes persuasively without actually making logical points.
All of his best points have been refuted elsewhere or are actually misleading. 
His best talent is pumping his blog, his ebook, and his shitcoin he's trying to fund: "cicada"

@_date: 2018-05-14 17:00:12
“Vice President” is an extremely common title in banking. Basically anyone who doesn’t earn this title by 30 years old is doing something wrong. 
Banks give this title to many people so that they’re taken seriously.
This is really not news at all. It’s no different than any body leaving any industry for bitcoin after 5 to 7 years of work.

He's comparing ver to the dao "hacker" who wasn't a hacker at all. The response of the highly centralized ethereum community was to remove the dao "hacker" by forking the chain. If the developers hold that much power, we are talking about a centralized system

We are obsessed with the price because the technology is far more capable with increases liquidity and because hodlers and developers are funded by the newly acquired wealth, fueling Bitcoin spending and funding new development

You can't preserve decentralization by becoming centralized. That's like bailing out banks to preserve the free market - the very reason Bitcoin was invented by the way

Which means you didn’t save anything because the Bitcoin you own went up in value. It’s an illusion.
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:11:31
How is this ad hominem? You said that capitalism didn’t work in this situation. I say it’s working as planned. You were free to make a choice and you made a bad one. Now you criticize the system instead of your choice.
Just the type of person to believe UBI is the answer to solving poverty.
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:32:02
Value is a proof of work on a universal ledger. That ledger stores information and in order to secure it, mining has been performed. The proof of that mining work is represented by the incentive of the mining, bitcoins.

You can be high level and still get the analogy correct though. This is not a stock split. Plenty of analogies could be drawn using monetary inflation or stock issuance

Purse never seems to actually work for a discount. No one is going to give you a discount until bitcoin goes up and they want to sell. By then, your “savings” are actually much less than when you set it. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:08:54
Not buying Bitcoin but a Bitcoin denominated asset. There is built in counterpart risk. Close but no cigar 
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:01:51
Not correct. Meme posts often dominate r/all.

@_date: 2019-03-11 17:09:21
Used it. Order sat there forever until bitcoin price moved and at that point the “discount” was negligible but they still claimed I received the nominal discount because they consider the original price not the floating price 
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:26:00
Again you are confused. I am not attacking you or the choices you made. 
For you to believe capitalism failed you is why I am arguing against. Capitalism gave you a choice. You should have taken the red pill and created savings. Now you instead are suggesting that the system failed you. It’s the opposite. Bitcoin is returning personal responsibility!
Best of luck. Hit that downvote button with full angst.

We take our sensitivities very seriously around these parts, amigo
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:42:52
The choice to not diversify your efforts so that you had savings. Anyone who saved bitcoin for as long as you have been involved should be able to fund themselves. 
Bitcoin is returning the advantages of sound money and freedom and you chose to use that freedom in a way you now regret.
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:32:02
If you bought coins you would be doing more than ok by now. You blame freedom because it made you free to make a bad choice.

I'm not suggesting this be outlawed... not sure how a position on "freedom" applies here.
I, too, am interested in motives, but this is not the first time I've seen these hosts be less than respectful to their "guests."
There are plenty of hosts that ask tough questions without literally calling their guests names.

Statistically, it has been best to buy all in one shot and wait it out. So if you are ready to go, I say buy it all in one.
If you are nervous at the idea, buy in increments so if it goes down you don't have to feel as bad.

@_date: 2017-04-14 11:37:40
Totally agree with the sentiment, but there are surely no unalienable rights when it comes to Bitcoin.
This term "unalienable rights" means a set of rights that cannot be stripped away due to natural law. Bitcoin is built on consensus and is therefore closer to a civil rights system, but really not a "right" at all. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:30:48

A quick google search seems to contradict your statement: 
The currency section says that cocoa beans were used for daily transactions and gold for large transactions. 
It goes on to say that gold was used by the upper class to display power.
@_date: 2016-09-09 00:44:42
Is it that important though? The entire point of the security is to ensure that a lost key figuratively means lost coins
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:39:31
Or less if it’s up. But in layman’s terms, it’s about 2 weeks

Difficulty is set every 2 weeks based on the hash rate during that period.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:26:55
Assuming the seller is the pushing the trade and assuming the volume is very large you’re likely to see a below spot price since a sell order on an exchange would bring the price down just to fill all the buy orders

The market is perverted. Intel does not represent you, though you likely use their products. And their products are protected by thousands of patents, just as regulation creates barriers to entry for many Bitcoin businesses, as I suspect you know very well given your own business.

But it’s a good warning in either case
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:15:09
I mean you set your price in USD but it doesn’t get accepted until the price rises to account for the discount. Also it takes a while
