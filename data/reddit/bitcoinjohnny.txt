All common theory is that it will go up substantially. Supply and demand dictates that as more people desire something, assuming supply stays constant,  the price of that item goes up. 
The supply is relatively constant, with a slight, regular increase until the last coin is mined.
If,  demand vs supply of Bitcoin goes up a little, the price should also go up a little. If  demand goes way up, well..... I would think the price would reflect the increased demand and go way up, as well.... :  )
PS- Remember this is bitcoin. Anything is possible.

How could he have the same basis if his brother mined/bought it and he received it as a gift. His brother received no gain(might have spent $1,200. USD for it) Can his brother claim a loss in income if he gave it to him at $800.

My goal in life is to leave this world a little better off than when I got here.  Supporting Bitcoin via mining, trading, spending, gyfting, discussing it with business owners, local pubs, stores, ect.. To see who is interested, accomplishes just that!
Bitcoin is the most intelligent and sane idea I've seen in a decade. I personally don't give a damn if they go to $1,000,000 each or stay at $100. Never will I doubt the "value" of the idea. Onward through the fog... : )

"look into how the FDIC is funded" ---Thanks I did.
I'm sure they could handle a few bank robbery's, bank failures and what not.  They do not seem to have a large enough reserve to handle a wide spread bank run.
Looks good on paper, but the money is not really there. Looks like government issued security notes for the most part. No real ability to cover all the account that the are responsible for.
To even cover the ~3% fractional reserve that most US bank claim to be holding, seems beyond their funds.  Much less all the "insured" money. 
It's sounds good, but personally, I don't think so.

The Bitcoin protocol, is  decentralized, not under anyone's control. No favoritism, no lying about actual balance's (vote counts, in an election) allowed. Can't game the system.
If you control a private key, only you, not a trusted third party, your "vote" or financial decision to purchase something can not be impeded. The transaction does not require approval. Is not limited to whom or were it goes. National borders and unneeded restrictions are eliminated. A truly global system.
Remember the Gore/Bush election? More Americans voted for Gore than Bush (fact), but due to the electoral college manipulation  nonsense. Bush won.
 If the Bitcoin protocol was integrated into the voting process, abuses like that would not be possible. No entity can alter the recorded, time stamped decision you make. They can not change the vote. Any attempt to alter reality would be rejected by the millions of independent computers running the system. Checked and rechecked, over and over. A single discrepancy, and it's consider invalid. 
Bitcoin protocol can also be used to digitally sign things, like artwork, publications, land deeds or contracts, etc... Once ownership is established, that's it. No way to contest or deceive. Mathematically proved.
Sorry to ramble but Bitcoin is such a larger thing than mere money. I hope my examples help.

I'm sorry I was not more clear. I'll try again.
You implied cutting funding would"stave the beast" (I assumed you meant the government) but that it would not give us control over it.
I merely remarked that we don't need to control the government if it does not effect us.  If the government has no power over your money, what can they do? No control over the money, no power to force you against your will. 
Freedom of choice. Send or receive funds, any amount you want, to or from who you want, when you want.

" Your logic does not include a few vitally essential aspects of politics or business for that matter. You can't run a government based on constant voting, because the minute you were to include an unpopular decision in your plan you would be thrown out of office......................... or be denied the right to run certain strategies."
Actually, that sounds good to me. I'm sure an suitable replacement will be on hand, more than willing, to actually represent,  "will of the people" with no waste of time or real effort....: )
Next- "In politics it is essential that politicians are able to lay out and plan full-on strategies to get efficient work completed."
Untrue. (Bitcoin seems to work fine. ; ) You said "unpopular to the general public" Do you really mean against the choice of the majority of citizens being represented? That was the original idea. IMO

First: The Chinese have banned bank/third parties from dealing with it.
The US government has it on the terrorist watch list. FUD up the butt...not to mention the- It's a currency, no wait, it's property bullshit.
It's illegal in Vietnam, potentially illegal in Iceland(unless you mine coins), heavily restricted in China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon. Source-Jan/2014 Wikipedia.
Countries don't seem to be accepting it,  as much as 'they accept' that it is here and they can not get rid of it. Can't unring a bell. 
Second: Bitcoin was labeled as a "disrupted technology" by Forbes as well as a dozen others including Reddit. The phrase was used so often it became passe.
Last: Bitcoin is already finding mass application.  It's used world wide. It just started and it is growing very strong, very fast.

Not  being 16 myself, I can imagine what you are going through. Bitcoin can be very difficult concept to understand. Have him read  Shatoshi's white paper.
If you print him a secure encrypted paper wallet and tell him that the private key is like a Swiss bank account number(not exactly but similar) except that he does not need to physically go anywhere, ever, to obtain or move his money around. He controls his own money, himself.
Bitcoin will deliver it for him, via the web, to anything with a wallet, himself included, to  anywhere,  anytime, almost instantly, for almost nothing. 
He becomes his own bank. He is now able to control when, where, and why his money moves, no third party involved.
 Bitcoin can be a hard idea to grasp, but it is well worth the effort to learn. Imo
PS-Don't leave the bulk of your holdings online, offline physical cold storage is much safer. This is not not an exact description of Bitcoin but I hope it can be of some help.... : )

Interesting idea and a very good point about the amount. The .0000001 figure was just one option, a greater amount could be sent with minimal fees.
Also, they spend the bitcoin fraction when they send it, but get it back when the people vote, no real cost. If people choose not to vote just add the amount sent to their tax bill. No real cost to the citizen.
Using the Bitcoin protocol to vote would probably cause election costs to go down. Imo

Thanks for asking, I'm not an expert but my understanding is-
Bitcoin addresses by themselves, cannot be linked to anything except other Bitcoin addresses. However, if you use your own computer, you can be tracked by the computers specific ip address. 
As far as taxes go, if you spend $80,000 a year in purchases, with bitcoins, but only claim $20,000 a year in income. Well, the IRS may be corrupt and greedy but they are not dumb. Imo
 Purchases made on your computer, delivered to your house or warrantied by you, etc... would be traceable, Bitcoin purchase or not. It is possible to have true, or at least ridiculously close to true anonymity
 with Bitcoin, but you must ensure that no other tracking methods exist. 
Any company can set up a Bitcoin cold wallet (safe) to receive and hold funds, then transfer it to their hot wallet (potentially hack able), for a minute, as it disperses the funds, basically instantly, for almost nothing in fees. Imagine the savings in accounting expenses  and the money saved in fees. Worldwide it's a staggering amount.
 Corporate entities can have wallets, anyone, or anything can. It's open to all. People, kids, businesses, cities, governments, anything.
Bitcoins spent at the store could just go into the company's wallet(s). Like their bank account only they are the bank with Bitcoin.
I hope I'm making sense. Have a good night... : )

No arranged, controlled voting places or times.  Vote when even you want,  free to change you vote at will, truly representative of the peoples actual will.  Not a rigged event.  (see Bush/Gore)

I personally have nothing but respect for the KnCMiner company.  If you were into mining this time last year, you should remember the general feeling of disgust people had with most Bitcoin mining equipment companies, Butterfly Labs, etc...
KnCMiners were not only delivered on time(within days) but with a higher hash rate than advertised.  That helped the Bitcoin network.  Every time I dealt with KnC, things went extremely well. Very good customer support. 
Considering Bitcoin minings uncertain nature in general,  I would say that KnCMiner is not perfect, but so damn close, it scares me... : )

I don't think Bitcoin will 'replace fiat' either. Fiat will be around for a long time, yet.
1) Bitcoin is a far superior method of value transfer than fiat. The reasons are just to many to list. See above.^^^
2) To get paper 'money', you could just print paper wallets with BTC value loaded on them. It could then be physically traded, like cash, for gold. Equal in value, according to many gold dealers..:)
3) Personally I like Gold, a lot. But no one should have all of their wealth tied up into just one method of storage. Gold, Fiat, Bitcoin, etc... Much safer to diversify. 
I don't think Bitcoin will replace fiat, either. However,  Bitcoin is  a far superior method of transferring economic value than fiat. People will use Bitcoin 'instead' of using fiat. Not replace fiat with it. Imo

You could be entirely correct, maybe the private keys are gone.
If I was Satoshi, I would hold them and slowly feed them back into the network as needed to help Bitcoin prosper, or provably destroy large blocks of coin now and then to reduce further how many bitcoin that can ever be. Scarcity tends to boost demand. I'd have the choice to do either or both.

Actually, it's a terrific way to pay for shopping. You would have the same rights again fraud, or dishonest vendors as you would with a check or cash.  
Also, available, for next to nothing, Bitcoin related companies that will hold your coin until you receive your purchase and then allow the vendor to receive payment.
Bitcoin is not a miracle cure for dishonest fucks. It's a way to transfer guaranteed funds to almost anyone, almost anywhere, securely for next to nothing. It's quite fast and it cuts out fees and the need to trust a third party.
Try to game the system. It's not too likely to happen.

Bitcoin has already changed the world. People are now able to easily buy online without a credit card. Not everyone has credit cards/Bank account cards.

The specific appeal to you would be that you now have another viable option to safely and easily store or transfer wealth.  I believe Bitcoin to be an addition too, not a replacement of, fiat money.
Bitcoin is not going to cause the fall of the western civilization, in fact, it may just help prevent  that.
I doubt it, but a man can dream.
 
Also, there is no new "Bitcoin upper class" The poorest slob on earth with just 65 cents to spend can use Bitcoin to send a quarter to his cousin, all the way across the globe.  Almost instantly, for almost nothing. 
 Rich or poor,  Bitcoin has fiat currency beat, hands down. 
The idea that Bitcoin will cause the fall of the western civilization is just not probable.  Bitcoin simply gives you another option for handling your finances. Imo

One of my Bitcoin miners gets  about 420 Ghs- When I check with the mining calculator sites like Cryptocoin and such...
I should make just under 1/10th of a bitcoin a day as I do... : ) but that currently at $820 a bitcoin (coinbase) is only approx $75 USD a day, or approx 18 cents per ghs a day after running costs.
So if you are paying more than 18 cents a day per ghs, you would be better off just buying Bitcoin directly, or buy some mining hardware that can produce even 1 ghs and run that for bitcoin production. Don't be fooled.
 Run the numbers and remember--Difficulty isn't likely to go down, less bitcoin each approx 10 days. .10, .09, .08..ect... Do the math. Basically, if you don't own mining equipment now. Just buy Bitcoin... ; )  Imo

It a common tactic, currently employed by most governments, to try to cut off the flow of funds to those it's attempting to control. It weakens the other party. It also, works both ways.

Anytime you use the "old" banking system, checks... fee's would apply.
Imagine having a bitcoin wallet that had the public key available to your boss, friends, family, etc...
They could get $ to you for almost nothing by sending BTC value instead of fiat currency. You could use that wallet to purchase needed items. I do it often and it work's perfect.
The goal of Bitcoin is not to take Fiat/check currency and have it converted in BTC.  It is there to replace fiat with a much better system.  You can collect and spend funds without ever seeing cash or checks.
Hell, right now you can purchase store gift cards, with BTC at a 6% discount.  So, a  $100 gift card, Home depot/McDonald's, whatever. It  would only cost you $94. with no fees involved.
Try to get paid in BTC if you can. No fee's would apply. If you convert fiat instead, at least no huge fee's when you spend.... : )

Get off your ass and do something about it. If you don't need to work with(100 Btc), donate your time to help others, a very rewarding thing to do.

With a worthwhile lifestyle, helping other and a positive attitude bent on developing friendships, encouraging interactions with yourself. You will have a life.

Focusing only on the current price prevents one from seeing the main idea behind Bitcoin.
I believe Bitcoin was created to provide a sane alternative to the nonsense existing today. Not just a different kind of currency, Bitcoin is a new form of value transfer, period.

I'm not a programmer, but I think one way to assign an address would be for the government to have a wallet, send each "legally registered voter" via a digital signature, one millionth of a Bitcoin.
They could then send it to the person they want elected, it would count as one vote.  If attempts were made to double vote, it would be apparent and would not count. The recorded vote would now be part of the Bitcoin blockchain. Time stamped. Verifiable.
Bitcoin timestamps the transmission of funds, Btcs, not public keys.
Since the blockchain is open, to anyone, fraud would be difficult or even impossible to preform.
Again, I don't know all the specific program related issues, but I've heard from seemingly intelligent people that it's a real option.

It's always been the intention of the Bitcoin design that fees for transactions would increase. IMO.
Without miners, the blockchain itself as well as Bitcoin  would not even exist... :  (
Miners can not 'work' for free.  They do the job of keeping track of every single Bitcoin transaction globally and it cost money... They buy hardware, the physical miners, the use of bandwidth/internet access, the electricity, the time spent maintaining a good running system...etc.
In a few years, the reward for all of that work, will again half and only one single miner alone, each ~10 minutes gets paid 6.25 bitcoin.  
Then~ 4 years down the road, only 3.125 bitcoin, etc...
The higher transaction fees were always intended, to encourage and frankly, allow people to mine.  No miners, no Bitcoin...  ;  )

I checked with a person that often helps me on matters relating to Bitcoin.  He said that if you go to blockchain.info and enter the key that there may be a helpful clue to what exchange you used...
Also, he suddgested that you check your old emails, as they sometimes send you a confirmation note about the deposit.  Other than that. IDK
Good luck....  :  )

“In its current form, the bitcoin is extremely dangerous,” Williams said. “It needs to be amply tested before it’s allowed to be unleashed in our global economy.”
Sorry buddy but it's already out there.  You can't stop progress.  Cryptocurrencies are obviously the wave of the future.  No government control, oh no, not that...Be afraid, be very afraid... ;  ) Not.

 I once, in the beginning, just to test it, spent 860 mBTC (.86 of a bitcoin) for a telescope worth a hundred or two. I wish I still had that.

The unbanked have money, even if it's just a welfare check or from their family.
The problem is that they pay huge fees to cash checks, send or receive money, pay bills.  The poorest pay the most to process funds.... ; (
Bitcoin can help with that.

I saw this, posted last year by 'hamsoken' on Reddit. Has some info-
Payward, Inc. is a Delaware corporation, but there doesn't appear to be any "Payward, Inc." registered in California, either domestically or as a foreign corporation (formed outside of California), as required by California Law, since you are claiming that your company's governing law is California. There is no registration of "Kraken" as a trade name in either California or Delaware.
There is no contact information for this company on the Kraken web site, specifically no address or actual human beings associated with the company.
It appears as though Payward been soliciting investment online in violation of US securities laws (specifically the Securities Act of 1933) since you aren't registered with the SEC. This is also a violation of Delaware’s Securities Act. ( [1] )
Payward is not registered with FinCEN.
Payward is not registered as a Money Transmitter Business in California.
Sorry, I just can't trust a web site that has terms of service that are obviously not in any way reviewed by an attorney:
Governing Law
Any claim relating to Payward, Inc.'s web site shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
General Terms and Conditions applicable to Use of a Web Site.
Yes, that's right, a cut and paste "General Terms and Conditions applicable to Use of a Web Site."
This should be a warning to EVERYONE. Don’t trust a company that blatantly violates multiple laws. This place WILL be shut down sooner or later, it’s only a matter of time.
Sorry to hear of your troubles... : ( Thanks for the heads up.

If I were just now learning about Bitcoin itself. 
I would read - Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. 
AKA- Satoshi's White Paper. Study it first.
If you are asking about Segwit, there are literally hundreds of well written explanations right here on Reddit. Try other subreddit sites, BitcoinMarkets, etc...
Hope this helps.

It's a perfect opportunity for Bitcoin to really show what it can do!
@_date: 2016-11-14 00:06:48
P2P means- person to person.
Not -person to some fucked up controlling entitiy, then to the other person.
Bitcoin cuts out the need for a (third/bad-IMO) party to be involved.
They will never control it!  Hell, they hardly even understand what it is.  
.. ;  ) 
It will run right over fiat, one day, worldwide ... IMO
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:18:37

Bitcoin is just beginning.
The blockchain that it represents, will change almost everything.
Your knowledge of the intricacies of a decentralized computational power/Bitcoin gives you a huge advantage. Imo
It's easy to see what will be valuable when Bitcoin's blockchain is 'the' decentralized global computer system running both world currencies and governments...
 You can't transact a Bitcoin transfer without some bitcoin...To be on the blockchain, you'll need to move some bitcoin.  
Regardless of any missed opportunities in the past, knowing Btc as you do should allow you excellent chances to benefit,
 in the near future.
IDK. just my opinion...  ;  )
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:41:27
Good call,  but you never know... 
Imo  There is room for more than one coin.  
Bitcoin is unstoppable...  ;  )
If other coin's "fork off'--- what the hell. Just simply hold and see what happens.  No one has ever lost money by simply holding BTC.
These new forked coin's might gain considerable value,  soon...
IDK- Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:46:39
Theoretically, you could find a block, or two.
Not likely, but then again, many people play US state lotteries... Lol. 
You could push the idea of solo mining as a 'gamblers dream'...  ;  )
You never really know!  
It could happen. Imo
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:33:54
I'll think about that.
Thank's for the suggestion....
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:55
  
Well put! Loved that explanation to PM_ME_NORMAL_STUFF's post.. : )
Bitcoin is still in it's early growing stage. Imo. It is going to replace most fiat currency transactions worldwide.
I'm a miner.  
Personally, if it dropped to a dime, in price, I would still run the miners. Just to support the network itself. 
Bitcoin has overpaid, all of my investments, so much that it would only be fitting to 'give some back'.
I understand your point of view as far as profiting from the cost's involved in mining BTC.  It's not all about the money.
Helping to maintain a new, decentralized, person to person means of exchanging value, has it's own rewards...  ;  )  I love it.
Thank you for your comments.  You gave me a lot to consider...
@_date: 2015-08-11 00:53:11

I myself, simply consider the new coins, as frosting, on the cake...  ; )
They offer no real threat to Bitcoin, itself...Imo. 
Unwilling to try and guess the future, I simply hold them to see if the new coins make it or fail. Fuck it!
No great loss, either way. Imo
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:16:34
No worries...
Years ago, I spent ~9/10th of a Btc on a telescope. 
Today's value, under 200 usd.
  I would just discard or donate it now except, it cost me 7 G's...  ;  ) 
I keep it as a momento of my first real, Bitcoin for physical goods transaction.  The way I see it---
I may have helped to support the network during it's early days.
I gained huge assurance and respect for the blockchain's potential...  ;  )
I still have the telescope...?
I was able to invest in and support Bitcoin much more reassured by my own little, proof of physical acceptance of Btc, as legal payment, test.
Your purchase helped Bitcoin to become what it is today. Imo.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:43:20
It's very likely. Imo
Might take more than a year but what the hell.
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:05:54
 Yeah, I've seen that semi-glazed look in other eyes, while trying to explain a- p2p, no middle man, decentralized, value transfer system ...  ;  )
IDK---but I confider a slightly spread portfolio. One with some physical coin, some digital coin, some fiat, with other things to be the best way to save. Crypto is clearly the most interesting.
I feel that it's extremely likely to see significant gains made, soon. imo
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:28:21
Keep control of your private keys.  You will own the new coin by default.  
I think...  
Anyone know, for sure?
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:42:29
That would work. Sites trade for just over spot price. They will send gold for coin. Just over costs. $1,300 would cover shipping, etc...

Still, for it to truly function as a viable alternative to common fiat or any other form of  government controlled 'money'. Lol...
 It has to be cheap.........................................!
Billions of humans can benefit from the ability to send or receive value in a way that is decentralized and cheap. I know that 36 cents might not be much to you or I but, to some people.. literally billions of them, it is !
Bitcoin must find a way to stay inexpensive, if it is to be of real service. 
PS- Nice post. Thanks for that...  :  )

This article reminded me that Bitcoin is not only about price per coin...
It also about implementing a more sane intelligent way to move money peer to peer, without the current top heavy restrictions that exist with fiat currency.
12.4 %, up to 17% of your money, just to move it once. That is just wrong... : (  In a sense, a tax on financially challenged people. At the lower rate you would have to work, for free, for an entire year, just to pay to send the last seven years of money home. One out of eight workdays you don't get paid.
Bitcoin provides the intelligent, sane option of moving your money anywhere, anytime to anyone for basically no costs. You gotta love technology... : )

First and foremost, your businesses would be involved with Bitcoin.
Please consider the following:
  If only 10% of your business was in Bitcoin, like cash,  non reversible by design. You could benefit greatly.
 
*Ever get a bad check/charge that you had to write off. Not to mention those outrageous 3% 5% ?% credit card and bank fees.  What a waste of profit...: (
 *With the current,  global economy, foreign funds are more common than ever, in &amp; out, and  can take weeks to clear. Don't even get me started on the cost...: (  
 
*Unless you hire and pay for someone else to. You would have to carry on your person all of the days/weeks business income to the bank.  That could be a lot of cash! Do you have a ccw license, or go unarmed. How unsafe and What a waste of precious time...: (
 
Using the Bitcoin network.
You could safely deposit/withdraw funds, almost instantly clear foreign funds, and instead of paying ridiculous fees, offer a rebate/price discount to increase your businesses competitive standing. More customers, more money...: )
The only way to know is to try!  Get some bitcoin, or some mBTC and try it. Buy things in person or online with Bitcoin and try it yourself.  It might help you understand what all the excitement is about ...: )
Try it.  You will like it.  You and your wife have a great day!
Thanks for posting. It needed to be asked.
 Here is a mBTC. Get some more,check it out. accept it. pass it on, save it, spend it, whatever.  Please, try Bitcoin yourself, before you decide. Good day.

Everyone has some trouble at first. It great of you to help support your family. Bitcoin can save you and your family enough to make it worth the effort to keep trying. If after a few tries, with a few cents, it is still hard for you/them, just find someone you trust and have them do it for you.
Without using Bitcoin, up to one eighth of your money can get chewed up in fee's. Which is less for them to use. It's worth another try. It's not that hard... ; )

I don't think Bitcoin is competing with the RMB as much as planning to replace it. Any government would worry about that. Bitcoins strength is show by the degree of regulatory concern about it's existence. You can not unring a bell.

You are right. No amount of reading or listening can give you the feeling, that your involved in bitcoin. You need to own some. It's a new form of value exchange (money). It's occurring on a global scale. Never before has so much wealth been able to move so freely, peer-to-peer, not peer, to bank, to government here, to government there, to bank, to peer.

Although a lot of the youthful excitement about Bitcoin is maybe a little overdone, it is exciting.

The amount of interest and money the Chinese can add to Bitcoin as a whole,  is hard to calculate.   I think that the amount of both will surprise most people.
