Lol ppl down voting, u guys really think that after the crazy ride from April 12 and it's May 1st that BTC won't fall back a lil? Delusional, I pulled my profits and waiting on the sideline to buy in again while you hodlers sink. HODL DEEZ NUTS; sell once in a while
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:26:53
Bitcoin to 8200-8300

I got the same form and in December I only purchased $5k worth of coins. I did not take any money out of the account. Do I still have to report it on my taxes? I also did not have 200 transactions

Coinbase and gdax keep track of all your transactions, if u use bitcoin.tax they have directions there on how to upload that info into the system.

Good to hear! Did you ever cash out more then a $1000?
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:48:03
Don’t get how it’s sneaky, I purchased thru TD bank and do my taxes 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:10:23
