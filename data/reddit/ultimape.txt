I've always thought the real issue was consumer adoption.
I personally think the large draw of incoming idiots is actually a correlation with the rise of bitcoin gambleing. A fool and his money are soon parted.
Granted I'm being biased here, not everyone in the gambleing scene are throwing away their money. The house always wins.

They have a more aggressive option for small (micro)transactions that doesn't dwarf the payment with the $0.30 fee. 
I think the current rate is 5% + $0.05 USD  which is a lot more amiable for &lt;$1 transactions.
I am not aware on how bitcoin would hammer this out - perhaps different providers will over different rate structures?

It also means that if you aren't already a steam user than you don't have a voice on the platform. This makes a bit of sense. I wouldn't want non-steam users to up-vote random games. I want steam users to vote on games they would actually play and use.

I'm not OP, but am making a similar game with a friend. The way we are planning it to work is it keeps track of statistics for kills etc and slowly adjusts the costs/drop rates to create that kind or similar kinds of equipment. It will hopefully work out like [Asheron's Call]( ) and how it's magic system auto-balanced. The more IMBA weaons will naturally converge to a pricepoint where it is more costly to find parts or buy them simply due to supply and demand dynamics. This also acts as a natural financial sink-hole in the system to keep our economy heathy.
It also can be mitigated largely by having a rock-paper-scissors dynamic, where very damaging weapons will cost more energy to run - which means not being able to afford the energy cost of powering shields.  Larger ship will cost more, but have more hard-points for generators - but they will be slower to move and so you will need to team up with players to protect them - or sacrifice weapon hard-points with dogfighter bays.
Sure, every weapons will have a sweet spot where they are optimal, but finding that optimal case is hard - and only very experienced players will have the skills necessary to produce high quality parts while simultaneously gathering the correct resources.  This is what causes the 'running your own business' aspect of gameplay to emerge.

Thanks for the thorough reply! Simon Sinek is on my short list of inspirational people. It sounds like you're aiming for superfans so I can see the direction you are likely taking.
I've responded in another thread a bit on the logistics of using GWT etc for game development and am somewhat familiar with the paradigm. I'm personally not afraid of getting my hands dirty when it comes to complexity and the design problems with your game are the exact kind that I've been arming myself to deal with. For example, I'm currently looking at the logistics of using Scala.js as a remote actor platform for the ant game, mostly because I am getting frustrated with the splintered JavaScript ecosystem.
*I'd love to be introduced to the Open Dev program.* I'm in a position where I've got to worry about the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of needs right now, so I can't really devote time to something that doesn't have a direct chance to feed me. But I've got two promising jobs lined up and a contract that I'm hoping to land that might take the pressure off. With any luck I may be able to start devoting time to something I'm already into, (and it would look killer on my resume).
Even if its not in actual development, *I'd also love to lend a hand on the marketing side of things for fun*. I've been collecting a lot of interesting ideas as part of an incubator i've been trying to bootstrap.
I've got a programmer focused resume up on [Careers 2.0]( ) and I have been doing a bunch of tests on [Smarterer]( that might be relevant.

the flat fees also add up quite significantly within the $0.01 to $15 dollar range.  This is why convenience stores are selling charge cards or outright buying banks to get around the fees.  Smaller business are just doing everything in cash again because when credit card feeds eat up effectively 30% of your profit margins you don't really have a choice if you want to stay competitive.

From what I understand of paypal's position, and as a long time follower of braintree from before they were bought out, I don't think this is how it'll end up.  Paypal as a company isn't fast enough to compete. However, braintree has experiance with all that kind of stuff and they are more than capable at reaching out to providers and the developer community at large. It was a smart move by paypal - realizing they can't do it themselves they decided to back a company that can.
I very much expect them to manage their international transactions through 3rd parties much in the same way that coinbase has filled the gap that paypal couldn't fill.

In all seriousness, do you need developers? 
I'm part of a 2-programmer 1-artist indie outfit. Your kickstarter video looks almost 1:1 to our design documentation for the game we are making (we've even talked about the in-game currency thing for when we scale out to proper MMO).  Although we are going for a more realistic physics model that is somewhat similar to [Transcendence]( We are taking heavy inspiration from Battlestar Galactica and Wing Commander in the style of weapons and modules, and the two of us are ex eve-online players. 
We've been working on two fronts - one is the prototype with which we hope to test out playability and getting a 'Terraria in space' kind of game. On the other front is working on creating a massively scale-able spaceship simulation engine. Everything so far has been made in a way that will let us eventually replace the built-in simulation code with a connection to a remote server. We want to have player driven fleets and massive dogflights in the vein of [Star Swarm]( - but in 2d.
All our weapon and ship code is modular and data driven so that the 'AI' controller and the player controller both access the same underlying physics model and weapon subsystems. We have a very rudimentary AI setup - If you fly along the x or y axis, you will see enemy factions dogfighting. The AI system has been developed this way because we are planning to use the 'offline mode' AI feature like you've shown - recent build have already been able to dynamically switch between player and AI controlled ships. 
My roommate just finished the first [prototype]( It isn't very well balanced yet (we spawn too many ships and they don't scale well), but much of the underlying features are there as proof of concept. You may have to go into the menus to turn on the music.  He's done all the art and music himself aside from one of the ships that our artist friend textured.
We're going to be implementing an engine and power subsystem next that will power the shields, FTL system, radar, and weapon fire rate.  We really want you to be able to destroy an enemy ship's generator to be able to disable it and harvest it for parts. It also will allow for gameplay dynamics like needing to shut off your shield to charge the FTL's drive's capacitors. Our initial target is something with roughly the complexity of [Gratuitous space battles.]( One of our advanced features in the works is a 'gun' that shoots other ships. As all the ships and ammo derive from the same basic package system, so we can 'store' ships in the cargo hold and emulate a sort of 'carrier' system. 
We're waiting for the next version of unity to tackle a better user interface since v4.6 is supposed to have the new gui system built in. We may end up pivoting over the UDK since we appreciate the [open workflow they've incorporated]( - and we aren't really using many of unity's features aside from physics and asset loading and web player -[UDK4 's web player appears to be in the works](  We also have plans for an html5 canvas client as we are developing our server architecture to be web-socket oriented.
I'm a very heavy into simulation and AI myself, so I've been working on server oriented stuff and am currently investigating either using [spacebase]( (see their spaceship [sim demo]( or rolling my own system with Scala+Akka. The hope is to get something that lets us farm out computation to CUDA clusters on demand and scale out on cloud based services. I've got a small scale Ceph cluster setup for using as a scalable persistent storage server and am work on a different game to help with bootstrapping the AI planner, pathing and behavior tree systems.
I'd love to chat, PM me if you are interested and we can share contact information / resume etc.

A quick look at the html for  and I've already found a [pretty awful security issue]( [You're using third party .JS files]( that while they may be from trustworthy sources (google, twitter, facebook), its still a concern. This does not bode well for the confidence I would have in your security.
I can already think of half a dozen ways that someone with malicious intent could take advantage of that to rewrite bitcoin addresses on the fly... Do you really trust all 50,000 google, 6000 facebookers and 3000 twitter employees to not try to pull something like that?  Why even risk it?

True, I was just saying that performance issues aren't really that big of a concern on the browser's side of things.  For a game like this, most of the legwork is going to be server side anyway. 
My understanding of the change request for chrome to support asm.js is that they are not specifically supporting ASM.js as a separate engine feature, but instead focusing on making v8 run well enough that supporting asm.js directly is not needed: 
BTW - afaict, you can use  just fine across target browsers - and it seems to work fine in phonegap apps on relatively newer phones.
 While I'll admit that GWT is an odd choice for a game engine, [its not entirely unfounded](  If I recall correctly, the subset of Java that is compatible was chosen because they could get a near 1:1 translation in performance comparisons - as long as they do the right amount of performance tweaking, they'll do just fine. Google's clojure compiler is pretty impressive, and if they leverage ClientBundle they can get away with a lot of the normal RTT overhead issues with html5.
The most worrysome feature would be the client/server interconnct.  I've had some success with using GWT-comet, but they might have to write some custom stuff to leverage web-sockets properly.
Based on their current prototypes, it seems like they aren't going to have many issues.  I mean its not like they are doing anything super complicated with html5.
There is also a very large community of performance officionados all using GWT:  (this is from 2011)
**Edit:** and GWT already good support to be an html5 game engine:  and  (also from 2011). Basically search anything "PlayN" or "Ray Cromwell" results in some great resources.

TideSDK is an interesting project. If that doesn't work out, There are other pretty interesting solutions that could be rigged up in a pinch.
I like the direction construct 2 (which targets html5 Canvas) took. They basically load a node.js server inside of a .exe container and embed a simple browser using the loopback connection.  This also allows them to target [PhoneGap etc.]( to publish for cellphones using the same underlying code.
I think you might be able to pull off something like this for at least a windows desktop app using WPF in a similar way to how github for windows was developed:  and simply embedding an explorer widget- this would also let you target windows 8 apps with little to no extra difficulty.  If you run a standalone tomcast instance (or whatever you use on the back-end), you could target the same platform for both sides of the equation.
I know the ideal would be to have a consistent platform, but having a packing system being a little disparate wouldn't be the end of the world as long as it supports the same toolchain on the way down.

Bitcoins aren't IOUs, they hold real value and are money in themselves, thats kind of the whole idea of them being mined was intended to be about. The cryptographic computational difficulty gives them value in a way that is more akin to gold than fiat. Having the private key to a portion of bitcoin is conceptually the same as having a bar of gold in a safe and having the key to unlock it (to trade). The qusetion of if that bar of gold has value is a different issue than if we can write a million IOUs for bars of gold.
The major difference is that banks can't just print out more bitcoin IOUs on demand out of thin air and we can't have fractional reserve banking or quantitative easing phenomena. It takes effort to generate them.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:15:55
My understanding of it is that the data is stored within the bitcoin blockchain itself, maybe I'm misunderstanding, but wouldn't that mean it is also 'public' in a certain sense?
Also, if it is in fact stored on the blockchain, any thoughts on using something like IPFS for storing the data in a distributed way and just storing the IPFS hashes in the blockchain to save on blockchain bloat? I know that is what we are doing with [2gather]( (but against an etherium derived permissioned blockchain).

Yeah, most FOSS stuff is just shoveled on top of the core OS and its a bunch of user-land crap to help with desktop linux.  Just being FOSS doens't mean the developers are being responsible or that there are people actively testing the code.
Running an AIX mainframe or locked down redhat machine is a completely different animal. The security comes not so much from bugs in the code - but more to an effect of how locked down and segregated everything can be. Its hard to get things like nagios and [tripwire]( setup on a windows box, but is very common on linux servers.
