If the market thinks tether is a scam, why isn't the price of bitcoin going up, relative to usdt?

Yes, correct. If your using a password integer, I'd recommend the integer has at least 25 random digits. If you want to be safe, until the end of the century use 50.

Yes, you can do that, Thats how I represent bitcoin private keys in my python code.
For example, the bitcoin private key
can be used to generate a point on an elliptic curve. The points, X,Y co-ordinate can be calculated with python code. The co-ordinates are
Bitcoin can represent public keys in compressed form or uncompressed form.
The  uncompressed public key  is 04XY
The compressed public key is 02X if X is even, and 03X if X is odd.
In the example the compressed public key is
The uncompressed public key is 
So you can generate 2 bitcoin addresses from this public key.
From the uncompressed public key the bitcoin address is
From the compressed public key the bitcoin address is
You can discover than back in 2012 there was a small bit of bitcoin in one of these accounts.
The python code to calculate all these things is about 50 lines.
You need to be careful if you are generating bitcoin keys yourself.
People have lost money by making errors in their code. For example there is 69 bitcoin locked in the address 1HT7xU2Ngenf7D4yocz2SAcnNLW7rK8d4E , which was generated from a null public key. 
It's recommend that if genearte you own bitcoin address, first send a little bit of money to it, and send it back, just to make sure it works.

A 30 character password has enough entropy.
English has entropy of 2.62 bits per letter.  A 30 character password has 2.62 x 30 = 78.6 bits of entropy.
Currently, the entire bitcoin network can only brute force 72 bits in 10 minutes, on average,  so 78 bits is safe for the time being.

Not exactly,  a random string of characters, from the 95 I see on my keyboard has around 6 and a half bits of entropy per character. You'd be reasonably safe with 12 random characters, if you sha256 it and used it as your private key.
True, the pass-phrase "‘This is my hidden stash of bitcoin’ has a little more entropy than 2.62 bits per character, but is still difficult to crack. Safer would be something like "This is my stash of pink elephants".
To the gentleman who asked the question, 5tu has a point, it's better to be safe than sorry. If you sha256 a small number,  with less than 10 digits, and use it on the bitcoin network as your private key, expect to lose all your bitcoins in 10 minutes.

The sha256 function will only accept strings, or buffers. If you enter an int into the sha256 you will get an error. It's simplest to convert your integer with the str function.
Once you have your private key, you need to generate a public key, by a mathematic process involving point addition and multiplication on an elliptic curve. You then need to convert your public key into a bitcoin address.

To make this secure a password should be more than 30 characters, and not easy to guess. It's important to write it down on paper in case you forget  You might be better hash your passphrase +n, a billion times, to prevent any chance of a brute force attack on your private key.
Python code below, for n=6.
 
import hashlib
password ="insert password here"
n = 6
hash = hashlib.sha256(password + str(n)).hexdigest()
print hash
