Now fucking go ahead and tell me there is no sabotage happening here. 
This is it guys, the fight is happening right here, and there is big money behind these attacks and the whole reddit manipulation going on. This is the only way they can stall or even kill bitcoin-development. Now I don't know if the core-devs are in on it or simply stupid naive idiots, but it's obvious there needs to be something done, and don't start with "yea we are open to a blocksize increase, but..." - I've heard it a year ago and nothing has been done whatsoever. You are just delaying and delaying, using lies and deception to your advantage. Yes, the lightning network could be helpful, but it's not here right now and the network is bursting, there's no room left. Fuck all you two-faced liars.

Hearn is right and this subreddit is so full of shitty propaganda accounts I'm not sure how many real people are even left..

What if a shrinking network is a shitty way to propagate the currency of the future? I'm invested in Bitcoin and I want to see it grow. Your artificial limits are ridiculous and their continued enforcement is highly contentious.

Did you read it?
He laid it all out there for even the dumbest motherfucker to understand. RBF sucks balls, just like this forced fee-market, and if we don't fix the blocksize issue now, we will have to suffer the consequences - being slow, unreliable and expensive transactions.
My only hope is miners realize this before bitcoin becomes unusable and therefore useless and worthless.

Guess? What good is guessing, we could shape the future and make Bitcoin evolve but we rather cripple it with artificially construed limits.
But here's my guess, in 2 years Bitcoin-core is dead and everyone is using a new implementation called Bitcoin-anon, made by another anonymous entity (therefore immune to character assassination and propaganda attacks) with a feature for completely anonymous transactions.

Your theories are somewhere between absurd and ridiculous, did you even read what he had to say?
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:10:46
how old are you?
you are grasping at straws here, how would you know if he's depressed?
how would you know if bitcoin survives or price increases? SERIOUSLY HOW THE FUCK WOULD YOU KNOW MAN? CAN YOU SEE THE FUTURE?
what the fuck is this post but random predictions of future events??
