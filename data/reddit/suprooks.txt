Don't mind paying the premium.
I'm looking at their website right now... how do you buy it from them? They only have a couple of tutorials on how to buy bitcoins from other marketplaces.

OK, let's assume I will use real PayPal information, but I still don't want to upload my fucking passport to random websites.
Is there website that does it without verifying documents and shit?

No, I'm using my real credit card. I'm new to this while bitcoin thing and not comfortable giving out information to shady companies in order to protect my privacy in the first place.
I tried localbitcoins to buy with cash but it was too much of a hassle. I decided that I wouldn't mind a reputable company such as PayPal having my real CC number, but I wanted to use fake names and address because I don't know what is available to the vendor. The card can be traced back to me, but only if I'm doing something highly illegal and get a court order, which I'm not, so I'm cool with that.

Oh, you're the man dude, thanks! I'll have to give you some gold when I get this right.
Does it work with Tor? I'm trying to sign-up but it shows an "unknown error" every time.

Am I doing something wrong? Because they don't even have a limit for unverified transactions. I can't even buy $1 worth of bitcoins without providing telephone number, etc
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:24:51
No no, I'm just doing for privacy reasons. I'll have to do it without Tor, but eh, I think it's the only way. Mind if I PM you some noob questions?

Thanks, but they require uploading ID and shit that I don't want to do. Just quick payment through card processor.

Erm, that's the entire point of this thread. Given that said service is difficult to find, I wanted to know about if there's a place with unverified transactions for very low volumes of money.
$25 for a mid-sized company is well above the risk threshold they can endure.

I'm trying to buy small amounts of bitcoins just for seedboxes as well.
I'm trying to use circle.com but they ask for SMS and shit, there isn't any place where I can just send my PayPal funds and be over with?
