No worries. There seem to be just as many articles stating the exact opposite. No one knows where this is going.  
Although with RSK and LN on their way it should go up is my guess.

How dare you use that site as a source. Although it might be true that is just low.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:11:06
If that were true you would have submitted it to a developer and not created this public topic where there is not enough technical knowledge to prove you wrong, which you probably are.

While I agree with what you say, I also think the constant inflow of over the top bad news has had a big impact. For the past month every news article about China, South korea, USDT, bubbles, crashes, hacks, banksters weighting in, etc, etc, and the steady repetitiveness of it did have an impact. It took a lot of the positive hype away.  
What annoys me the most about it is that those articles in most cases were already proven to be over the top, like only closing anonymous accounts. But that did not withheld any newsoutlet/reposter from keep posting the same news over and over.  
I do think the correction was healthy but since bad-news-driven has put the whole crypto community in a bad spotlit. New people losing a lot of money. It will take a long time to recover from that. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:47:41
Maybe also because some exchanges are no longer counted for price and some for volume.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:20:20
Coinomi can handle bitcoin cash as well. no need for electron cash I think.

Coinbase can create an account and put $1M USD on there and buy some asset just as easily. This will be fine until there is not enough money left.  
Bitfinex does not need tethers to do what you suggest, they could have done that on their own exchange without any need for this public debacle.  
Also, tether just bough back a lot of tethers (so they allow sells): 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:16:48

They don't care anymore what they write. They want to prove fake news is real, it does not even really has got anything to do with bitcoin. It is mostly proving Russia is evil, Trump is a baboon. If you get 50% right, it is good enough to write an article about.  
As a dutch i'm just glad they kept the north of korea out of it this time so they can tend to their people, or mine more bitcoins.

It does. although blockchain shows the wrong size afterwards (by mistake, i'm sure /s). Use the other explorer to verify.

I think at least one input has to be segwit in order for it to be a segwit transaction.

Well, at least he is not as lame as Craig Wright.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:40:36
As someone pointed out to me once that would have meant he was discussing with himself (and others) using both names. That is why Kleiman would be a good fit.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:17:35
It goes further than America being the center of the universe, the article actually starts with: "The U.S. is trying to regulate cybercurrency offerings. It’s still unclear whether it has the authority to do so.".  
So they are talking about ICO's and not even bitcoin. Most if not all ICO's have been on the ETH network.  
Where do they find people dumb enough to write articles like this?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:00:14
They can't even write the name of the blockchain correct, what is wrong with these people.

I'm not 100% sure but did it ask you for a derivation path? It could be you need to change m/44'/0'/0' to m/49'/0'/0'.  
In any event they are not bidirectional and would be two separate wallets. You could use both however with the same private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:35:44
tools - preferences - appearance, you can use a wild variety of blockchain explorers. just blockchain.info shows te incorrect size for segwit transactions. It uses the legacy size even if it is a segwit transaction.

They crucified him for lying about being the son of god, and probably taking advantage of people for believing him. So it certainly does fit the bill.

@_date: 2018-01-29 12:20:00
So what you are saying that it only should be legal to mine new coins? Or should we only allow staking? Also there are many coins that have no fixed max supply.  
They are doing a pretty good job of keeping USDT at 1 USD from what I have been seeing. Of course there are some small moments it goes a bit up or down when people buy or sell big. But I think they are doing fine.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:13:55
Comon man, do you think we are that stupid?
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:55:04
Have been reading up a bit yesterday after someone posted some links about this subject.  
Good option would be Dave Kleiman and Hal Finney, as stated at the bottom of this article as well. Their sickness and deaths kinda fit the timeline.  
The option posted yesterday was Bram Cohen but has my doubts.  
Wright just does not fit, but he did try to say he co-created it with Kleiman.

Just stay out of it for a while until you have the same faith and comfort you had when you got in. If it was just a lack of information when you got in, just make sure you absorb correct information. Know your market.  
If your problem right now has anything to do with any exchange what so ever, even if it is the richest exchange in the world, stay out for a while. It is not worth blowing a gasket over...
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:57:43
GDAX used to sell way above kraken as well, not anymore. Maybe Coinbase is not selling as much anymore? They used to have a lot of new money coming. Also they started hiding their new user stats.  
Also the exchange with the highest prices is used most for selling, this may have an effect.  
All conjecture though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:59:19
Kraken 12444 euro. Someone should start doing some arbitrage right about now....
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:30:12
If you make a sell order way below the current price you still get the current price. You sell vs the first buy order.

Most creditcard payments get put on hold until the chargeback period is over. Otherwise you could get your money back, and they would lose the money, when you ask for a refund from the creditcard company.

some points already got answered in the twitter thread.
1) mainnet:   
2) you can keep adding funds to a channel but you could put 10 coffee in there to start with for the whole week  
3) the other side has your payment and does not really need you anymore  
4) You do not need the whole network, just a route. It is peer to peer  
5) although central nodes could start to exists if they are the best route, other routes could exists as well. Also it does not really matter. blockchain is public now as it is.  
6) mooo
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:16:50
Since almost every point you make is false I see no reason to correct you. This is just dumb.

Buy in euros?  
gdax: 12950€  
kraken: 12136€

You can long or short it on kraken using leverage.

Because it is illegal for one. They are under scrutiny. And although we make them out to be the bad guys, there is very little chance they are here to 'destroy' us. They have been playing this game for years but always from the sideline. Only thing they can do is be well informed, and that's what lacking with people on this sub (not meaning you)

@_date: 2017-12-08 09:23:32
Just hold it on the exchange until the fee's settle down, unless the exchange lets you send it cheap enough.  
When things settle down again move it to a wallet of your choosing. So... you now have time to find a nice wallet which suits your needs. You can use the search on this site for one, and there are some topics on the sidebar --&gt;

Bitcoins on coinbase/gdax are way overpriced. Use kraken. Saves you a few hundred bucks per bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:27:00
The block size will be larger, it is just that people don't care about your $10 transactions to some f'ing hyip or to ya granny, for now...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:30:03
I don't think this to be true anymore. Maybe my wallet kept relaying my transaction but I was toying around with very low fee's and the transaction was confirmed after more then two weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:40:56
So you just pulled a magic date out of your hat for all this 'volatility' to be over? Bitcoin is still up if you look 3 days back... don't predict 21 days in the future if you can't look 3 days back.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:20:26
In the end it does need to be settled. I will contain fee's but just a large quantity of small fee's combined.

Look here, top1 address:   
That enough for yah?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:06:08
I don't really care about people behaving like this, it is their good right though. What bothers me is that they get attention and have so many 'followers' that do really believe in what they have to say. Mainly because their message is somewhat the truth, any coin has scaling issues. It is just that they offer no solutions only some quick means to get rich.
Yes, the problems are real but he forgot a long time ago why he was a believer. It is no longer about the future, the technologie... it is about FUCK YOU!

I doubt anything will happen.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:52:49
The price of bitcoin is higher there so it might be a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:11:59
Somehow I have the feeling you are not really looking for answers. So i'll just repeat the incentive will be instant transactions and low costs, with addendum: they will outperform any rival currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:25:20
I'm sure you are right when talking about futures, but a lot of exchanges will let you short (real) bitcoin with no additional costs, just buy and sell. Like kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:58:49
There are too many addresses and too much not-involved money for tracking, if done right.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:28:15
They are doing tests om mainnet. In a short while it will be available for people to transact with. They said it will be a while before it is ready for (big) companies to start using it. There is not a set date as far as I know. Give it 2 months and ask again :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:12:15
Use coinomi. You can claim BCH and BTG with that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:43:47
Also because they want to see how the fee market and mempool develops I just read, since this is needed anyway when block rewards go down.
I found this to be a *very* informative read:

Sells like that usually occur of the books, so not on an exchange. Someone can buy them in bulk for a nice price. Usually an investor and not someone trying to sell fast and thus tanking the price. This happened to the silk road coins too I think.

Well, imo this guy deserved this although I do think they could have made some kind of effort to prove him wrong. But from what it looks like, he has been at this for months.  
Would be funny to do some kind of candid camera show and walk into random companies demanding the things he wants, slandering them as fraud... just go al bitfinex'ed on companies... I'm betting we would get arrested more than if we harass random people on the streets.

No, they do not. at least not for Cboe and CME

You could but you could go to jail for that. (if I understand correctly you want to evade taxes)
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:07:59
You have a post history of spreading this crap everywhere. But you're right, it is you are an idiot :D
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:24:01
The trick is done by already having everything ready. buy on one and sell on one simultaneously. transfer and redo.  
You could otherwise make less money than simply holding on to your socks because of the time it will take to move the money back to your account, and from there back to the other exchange to buy back what you have sold.  
So double up on what you think you  will need to play this game and give it a go.  
Please also remember that there are a lot of people with a lot of money already playing this game. If big discrepancies are there, there could be a good reason for it. The price difference between coinbase/gdax and kraken for example has always annoyed me.... but i'm not about to plug it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:57
Anything to back that claim up with?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:09:44
the 39% you are talking about is income tax, right? I don't think it falls into that category. You pay the same taxes as if it was saved money on your bank.... retirement I think...  
Will look further tomorrow but 39% looks out of bounds...
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:52:01
Well, trolling usually is just random shit. Not continually harassing a person or company for months on end.

Just make sure you have everything in place to do it simultaneously. buy and sell at the same time. This way if bitcoin rises you do not miss out.

It depends on your country. In the Netherlands we only pay a percentage over the total amount valued at 1 Januari. This would be the sum of your BTC in EUR + your EUR on the bank.

Some people are easily scared and others take full advantage of that. they want to sell/buy before others do, so you are quite right.

It seems like you didn't or you don't understand the purpose of it? But I do agree with you with need larger or faster (quicker) blocks.

If I transact early in the morning I receive it the same day. Withdraw 1 or 2 days. weekends excluded of course.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:54:43
Nah. just zoom out and you'll see BTC is right back in line with the regular growth, so before this massive price spike.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:09
If you sell BTC, gdax does have the highest price I believe. You could also look into a direct debit card like tenx, bitpay or bccpay offers. This way you can cash out smaller amounts and not do bigger withdrawals because of the fee's.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:44:49
They will have their own coin so I doubt it will make a difference, if true.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:18
1) I don't have those taxes  
2) I'm ok with it for now as bitcoin makes that up in 10 fold. 1200 just today  
3) could be better but I manage  
So nothing to backup your claim with besides being very negative. It is usable as a currency.

Just your own thoughts then. Nothing substantial.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:59:50
I think a lot of coins on the exchanges being sold are actually used for buying products and services. The seller still needs the money.

@_date: 2017-12-08 09:31:21
Buy low, sell high. It is sound advice but hard to time. What people seem to be doing lately is trying to create a dip by spreading stupid story's... like this one. He is talking about market manipulation from wall street like people, the only regulated people in the bitcoin industry. It would be funny if it wasn't so dumb. But with spreading these rumors people get scared and might actually sell, thus making it a self fulfilling prophecy.  
It really is the one after the next FUD story these days and maybe not even worth paying attention to. When multiple people at the same time come with wild stories, telling about how it's going to crash, just laugh.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:41:54
Yeah, maybe. But the amount of coins would be endless, there are just too many. Just buy here what you can and then transfer to something like poloniex to buy the alts.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:05:06
You sold "a lot" of btc today but are in here talking about $20? Does not compute...
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:58:13
I see in your post history you have a magic crystal ball that tells you bitcoin is going to crash hard over the next two weeks. Your just an idiot that can't help himself.

clearly it will solve 'everything' like you stated in your first message.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:02:32
For coinbase my drivers license was enough. Now that I want to use gdax I also have to submit my passport and a webcam picture of myself. I am a bit stuck there for now as I do not have a webcam on my computer.... All the verification is getting a bit ridiculous... way too much. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:52:40
Another (off topic) thing: Funny that people are whining so much about bitfinex solvency. They have the top1 address with 127,342 BTC.

Yup, he should create a username bitmex'ed and go all bitfinex'ed on them for months :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:30:50
They are not.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:51:23
I have my bitcoins spread out over multiple addresses. So this kind of info could be very misleading.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:47:49
get a card like bccpay, tenx or bitpay and don't spend flagging amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:21:35
So, if you think this is a currency... you give people money on Christmas? ouch
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:46:39
Has been asked and answered but: There is a good chance the wall will move when the price it is about to be reached. Otherwise the USD people will have some buying to do.
It also makes sense that someone who bought a lot the last few days to not let the price crash too much would want to sell (some) now, with a little profit of course. This makes sense for me from the perspective of protecting your investment. Invest some more to not let it go down too much.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:56:26

You could clear the cache. This helped me numerous times before I went over to Electrum.

They would mine for the fee's but indeed some miners would walk away but that is not really an issue if it goes gradually. At this point I think there are to many miners. The power consumption is enormous.

I helped friends verify last friday. It was down before that... so I guess it is intermittent. Kraken just did some updates it looks like so just keep trying I guess.

It did not create any panic or tanked the price.
"During that time though, the effects of that speculation started to hit the bitcoin market. Prices started to fall and then fall faster as the news spread. The price fell as low as $565 after it had started the day around $628. When the market “closed” according to Coindesk, the price had dropped 7.34 percent."
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:48:08
This quote is from you: "And their sweet, sweet panic will allow us to buy the dip again. I hope.". You just try to help create a dip for your own gains by spreading this crap!

What amazes me is that everyone was happy about the futures when they were announced. It is an exciting event. Somehow that shifted to 'everyone' here falling head over heals to scare people. This is so weird, but I guess that comes from such a divided community. It's a shame.
What had me on the lookout most was the week before the segwit2x split, the incoming money into BCH and the (short) drop of bitcoin. Together with all people shouting bitcoin will be replaced. Really takes a strong mindset to decide then and there to ride it out until the end. ( HODL! :) )

How would they lower the price? They would need to have BTC to sell them. They would then buy back their own coins or something?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:55
I have read the entire thread (woosh, long read) and now fully think the block size should be increased (2MB for now). We can not let it happen that lightning will be the only remaining method of using bitcoin. I do think lightning will be a good method of buying stuff in (web)shops as it is very fast, but we need to make sure we can do transactions without going bankrupt by fee's.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:47:38
I can't tell you what to do, just what I did:  
1) start with small amount of my own money and learn the ropes  
2) get money to invest which ever way (i did 15,000 loan...)  
3) learn way more than what you have started with... this ain't not joke.... see this as your job)  
4) make a fuck lot of money)  
5) pay of any loan if it out wages your income  
6) fuck everybody else  
7) fuck everybody else

I'm dutch and our papers are really nothing to worry about anymore. Nothing but propaganda and goody two shoes stuck in their own little world portraying it as they hope it would be, which it aint.  
Together with the EU our government is spending such ridiculous amounts of money and the people living there do nothing but work and paying taxes (highest taxes in the world together with low buying power).

Did you try turning it off and on again?
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:52:21
Probably this guy then:   
He got robbed of that exact amount. Or just doesn't want to pay tax over it and fakes his loss. He is too cool about it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:46:18
Could be. Specially margin calls. This happend on other exchanges as well. Of course it was kraken.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:15:55
Just wait for a bit. Fee will drop. Also if you keep investing for a while it won't take long to have something worth sending over.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:10:43
Whats up with the 'it can crash' posts every five minutes... shit's annoying.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:57:39
Just keep your coins on a fork supporting exchange for a few days. The exchange will take care of the splitting and will make sure you have both coins in a safe manner. This way you can sell the coins immediately if you would want to.  Keeping your coins in your wallet is much harder and you wont have access for a few days.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:07:15
I'm not using coinbase so I am not sure but I think you can send to an online casino, just not receive from one... or not?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:53:46
BCH is targeted to produce 6 blocks per hour, just like BTC. BCH can readjust faster, so it will even out again. Both have 12.5 coins payout per block, you do the math. BTC is more profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:24:14
Why would any experienced hacker reuse an address? I don't buy it, there is something seriously wrong with this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:38:31
I think he will try to keep BCH up a bit... lot's of people dumping that coin too. If it would go down too much right now it would be over even faster. At least he is putting his money where his mouth is...
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:15:36
They have no where to spend that coin. Only by shapeshift or changelly.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:42:11
Almost your entire post history is screaming about dips and hanging in FUD topics. Shouldn't you get a new hobby?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:45:40
How do you know there has not been any word from them? Have you looked? Are they in any of your feeds? Or do you just want to bash?

From my point of view I am your father. You are still worth norhing dough, you little shit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:09:22
Good. All that is left now is to make the companies pay. I know there are some list available, we should post those more often. Especially entities like 'pool. bitcoin. com' who wanted to use my/our bought hashrate for mining an altcoin without me having any say over it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:25:44
I think Ver is a taker, not a giver... so you might be asking the wrong questions.

1) Get your private keys or seed. Download electron cash and see if you can access it that way.  
2) start paying more attention :D  
3) good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:16:34
They are just moving off to another coin. B2X will be carrying that burden. Bitcoin will drop in difficulty and regular miners can warm their houses while mining.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:58:03
Step aside son, let the men handle this.  
(but all the best to you)

Just keep calling people retards until you look in the mirror and have some better reference of what you are saying.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:51:16
Not if they are doing this without core. Also miners should not do this, they provide a service.

Yeah, cause that is exactly what happen the last week
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:40:04

Take the bet, worst case you get drunk together.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:04:36
No, me neither but what I was referring to was the emergency difficulty adjustment mechanism introduced by bitcoin cash when they launched. It has worked well for them and can be copied.  
But I hope you right and those smarter than us are working on this issue as we type :D
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:03:51
Satoshi will pull the plug. It is over guys! go home!
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:44:03
I took out .5 to pay the bills yesterday. Kraken had it on my bankaccount the same day. used SEPA.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:49:11
I see some transactions posted here already being confirmed. good work!
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:07:17
Nah, after some difficulty adjustments we'll be back on track and they'll mine some shitcoin or will be coming back.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:17:56
That depends a bit on the size of the exchange and the volume on the market there. What is harder though is predicting what way the market will move.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:13:48
I think you are mixing two subs up. there is a and a Also I just gave him info about how I would gather the information he requested. He might even find a place that way where the collection he requested can be found, but I would not know of such a place.

I've used the installer but have not got any such warning. Even after re-scanning with a fully updated defender.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:35:08
There is something off about those numbers you keep posting mr. Bot. Block time is more around 15 minutes and has been for quite some time.  
Please look at   
Maybe I'm wrong but mr. Mempool agrees with me.

sure there is. It's debt vs credit. inflation vs deflation. us vs them. Get with the program soldier. You're so wrong your not even funny!
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:04:16
Kraken. It is always cheaper then bitonic and bl3p, but it usually does not differ this much. it is 5120 now on kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:29:51
I doubt it. Would make bitcoin worthless the moment it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:50:15
I heard you just fine. You missed my point.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:29:38
Not to nitpick but it is wash, rinse and repeat. But I do need a bath right about now...

Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:36:23
It might not even be a bad idea to quickly introduce some emergency difficulty adjustment mechanism. The block chosen to fork is right after one of those adjustments I thought and it would take a long time for another.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:28:56
Put your coins on an exchange who will give you both coins
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:48:29
The people who are shouting about the problems also caused it. because of the faulty EDA in BCH miners have been jumping back and forth. Without BCH these problems would not have even existed at this point.  
It is very easy to create problems and then start pointing at them shouting that there are problems. But it suits their cause apparently.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:46:12
I'd rather they buy bitcoin, this is just gambling. How would this help bitcoin in any way? Just toys for rich boys.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:44:20
Maybe they adjusted it to cover the fee's? But you should contact coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:59:43
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:04:25
Don't think you'll have to wait all that long at this rate.  
8790/9094 depending on which exchange you look. kraken/gdax
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:23:22
Some people say they will continue with that fork with very little support. It will however have little to no effect anymore. You will get those coins though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:26:47
They calculate with 10 minutes per block. At the moment it is 15 minutes per block. So expect a few more days if this does not change.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:43:09
I always wait for a good wallet to support the new coins, this might take a while. For instant access, so you can sell immediately, you will need to keep your coins on an exchange for a few days. Anyone who tells you different is someone who makes your coins inaccessible for a while. There is a lot of misdirection spread around, I don't care. fuck most people...
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:36:20
You have no clue what you are talking about. The EDA already happend and the DAA will only make BCH difficulty more stable. Go away
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:59:53
Nice! But no bitpay card in the comparison?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:59:56
I doubt he understands how stupid he sounds. It is because the enormous price rise that mining got this profitable. It was never meant to be million dollar companies using enough power for a small country.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:08:28
Get back to reality man!!!!  
  
They have absolutely nothing to prove to you. These are huge companies and your just talking nonsense. Deal with it!
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:56:44
Keep saying that to yourself
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:18:58
They will make sure you get both coins in a safely manner. No need to worry about replay protection and what not.  
Also you will have access to both coins as soon as it is safe.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:21:04
Because of the nice fellow helping people boosting transaction in this sub I would suggest you first look into antpool.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:51:46
We're all going to get screwed over if any coin we hold fails, right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:37:28
Did they gave you bitcoin cash? (not yet or just yesterday you say?)  
You'll use most of your bitcoin profit anyways using that wallet cause of the high and unchangeable fee's. I suggest you get a real wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:39:18
I don't think so. I should be able to mine the Segwit1X chain if I want to show my support. They are just making sure there is going to be a shortage of hashrate. kinda like a self fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:59:30
That's actually the weirdest thing I have seen an exchange do, hold peoples coins hostage....  
better stay clear of coinbase then
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:54:28
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:21:33
Those guys have their heads so far up inside each others asses that whom ever could pull them out would be crowned king Arthur... I'm too busy though
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:11:39
I think they are just silently impressed by your paint skills. I know I am.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:05:13
In any event the whole setup now is for miners to cash big by mining both chains. one when the fee is high, one when the difficulty is low. Shame on them for toying with networks like this just to get paid more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:47:54
No, he can't. They only have a 2 month old video of some people having to guess. one says 6 the other says 18. Search this sub there is some info about the progress and the integration tests.

haha, at least you're trying :D

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:28:04
Just zoom out and look at the big price fluctuations. Then search for events around that time.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:55:12
If you want to use IDeal then bitonic or bl3p would be best. Otherwise SEPA to one of the cheaper exchanges, like kraken.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:26:26
So what? Bitcoin grew 900% and that is a multi billion dollar market. If they have a good service, people will use it.  
The article is complete speculation and 'concers' yet it is brought here like it is already true and 'will' fuel the next dip. Stop the FUD this is absolute crap, they even just had an audit.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:52:36
Some wallets keep the fee high, like jaxx. They don't want to say why. Keep saying it is calculated by the network while I can manually sent with electrum for 10 times less fee.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:01:49
Didn't you just create a topic about that?  
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:01:07
wrong sub fool!  
In the picture at least.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:13:58
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:07:33
I quess you just wanted to show it because the info is on the website stated on the coin.  
1. Tap "Receive" in your Mobi app, and then tap on "Redeem BTCC Mint."  
2. Scan your BTCC Mint collectible's private key QR code (new format), or enter the private key (classic format) in the Mint Private Key box without any spaces.  
3. Click "Confirm". Verify the bitcoin amount and then tap "Confirm" again. You should see a confirmation message. Please note that your imported bitcoins need to receive two confirmations on the bitcoin network before they appear in your Mobi wallet balance. BTCC does not charge a fee for the import of bitcoin private keys.
Ow... and try to sell that coin to someone after you have redeemed it. Wondering how someone would know you are selling them an empty coin
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:52:09

Who's them? The chef preparing my diner was quite fond of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:50:39
I think he works at antpool.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:35
Could be, nice thought anyway.  
What I was amazed about was the cheer amount that could instantly be bought on bithump. I mean, that has had to be available as well. It was quite literally a shitload. From what I gather it happend in minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:38:28
It won't be more profitable to mine because bitcoin is worth more. Unless they plan to pay miners more, which they won't.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:54:40
Like I said I used the installer, it is called electrum-3.0.0-setup.exe. I will download the one you used and scan it. Wont execute it though :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:41:30
Why pay off my loans? The interest per year is so low, like what bitcoin has been making in half a day, that I would rather keep my bitcoins and do regular payments.

Never noticed you can download them after airing?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:29:53
It started with 'I think...'  
But your topics got removed, down voted and generally shit on, i don't think it was just one person determining it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:21:04
You can get miners to add your transaction even if it is low on fee. Hell the child could pay for the parent. This is not an issue. These companies will just team together with some miners. And we are only talking about some coffee bill, they'll write it off as marketing.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:13:59
Again you have nothing more to show for it than your imagination.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:48:12
Absolute bullshit. Go away.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:35:42
Then you will have to wait for a wallet that supports the new coin, this could take a while. Also there is a chance of losing one of the coins when sending the other. There is no replay protection I keep hearing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:59:03
I hope coinbase would pick up the pace now and also dump instead of helding hostage those coins
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:28:54
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:32:11
No, they can just mine the coin that would be most profitable at that moment. That does not take into account changes in price. I think some miners should come to realize their mistake already but might have dollar signs in their eyes preventing them from seeing it yet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:51:57
They were used to taking shitloads of money from startups. And now we do. Although I guess there are a lot of scams out there, there is money to be made.

The thing about bitcoin is we need consensus. That actually means people have to agree and work together. The 'attack' happening now are the people who think they don't need that and that they can just go their marry way and they actually don't care about anything else.

@_date: 2017-11-08 13:59:59
They won't. Would be an idiotic move. If all the miners start mining some shitcoin of course they would have the higher difficulty. That does not make it bitcoin. This statement more or less makes them the enemy!

@_date: 2017-11-27 22:57:23

It's not... or do you see those numbers anywhere in that image?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:14

I agree with you that the US has bigger problems than bitcoin, that doesn't mean peoples opinion do not matter anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:51:53
You don't need USDT. But you can easily move money between exchanges with it. Or hold it without any volatility. its pegged to USD.  
People with USDT will be buying BTC or some other coin with it, to get rid of the USDT, since it receives bad news.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:51:03
You don't really have to remind us why we killed USDT, or do you?

You can get your private keys out of jaxx, then import them into electrum or something. I've seen people mention mycelium here.

I think you can provide a public key and have the BTC send there. That looks to me like a much saver solution then create a wallet there. But it does look like it can be done, but I doubt they would save the private key. No way of checking though.

A miner mines new blocks and fills them with transactions. Nodes validate the blocks and accepts or denies them. Also they are used for relaying transactions if I am not mistaken.

This was the title of your post: "We should get ready for another crash because of these stupid overleverged exchanges....now we have a new concept of exchange run!".  
I think that is not raising concerns. Thats just infantile crap. But I (maybe we) would be glad to see you leave!

From what I gathered somewhere between their announcement and the end of this year. They were not more specific than that. It does make sense to do in over a longer period so the price can settle again. Just dumping or buying quick just causes price swings and does not necessarily mean you get a good price.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:00:29
Also it is really weird that coinbase would keep peoples coins hostage until januari. If i was a customer there I would be really pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:05:49
Because there is no single reason in those articles other then 'some people think', and that is a big problem. (for some people both the thinking and making it public is a problem)
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:02:42
Yeah, I don't think exchanges would keep everything in active memory if it has no use in the books.

My plan is to read almost identical post here every hour or so up until the fork.

Maybe you can try this:  
"Register at:  Then after registration, go to:  Then put your tx in upper form to prioritize transaction, fill in the "I am a human"-code at bottom and enter.  
It is a free service, use it for urgent transactions (I hope it doesn't get flooded now) :)"

@_date: 2017-11-07 12:29:26
Stay away from pool. bitcoin. com. They will use your hashrate to mine b2x shitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:39:31

Can you elaborate why you think this?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:22:23
It is starting to get ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:09:13
You can use LedgerX: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:30:09
The fork will continue but it is not really hostile anymore and won't have any more effect probably. You will get those coins though.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:28:05
I have this message on pool.bitcoin.com:  
"Segwit2X Hard Fork  
If you are mining BTC now, you will automatically mine the Segwit2X chain after the hard fork. We will not initially support the Segwit1X chain after the hard fork. This is because over 85% of the global hashrate has agreed to mine Segwit2X, so it is unlikely that the Segwit1X chain will survive.  
If the Segwit1X chain survives the hard fork, we plan to give you the choice to mine it."
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:45:32
Yes, with low difficulty (less competing hashrate) it was much more easy to mine. And yes, the reward was higher back then because it decreases over time. Keep in mind however that 50BTC then was not worth all that much.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:38:12
No:   
See estimated next difficulty below the graph.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:16:14
This site has a lot of good info:   
The biggest problem now is the fluctuations in hashrate due to the difficulty adjustments BCH keeps doing. It can never balance like this. But I think it fits those miners needs. They are inflating the network by mining way to many blocks (and thus getting payed at expense of the users). Those people really could start losing money fast: 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:56:24
Of course not. They are creating version 0.0.1 right now. Give it time.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:48:48
We could call someone to hold your hand during all of this. What would you like people to say?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:04:28
Good to see there is another FUD campaign going on. Was getting scared we would have some boring days ahead.  
Tether is nothing else than an easy way for people to move money/coins that do not lose or gain value during transport. Nothing more. The idea is not that you go and cash them out. You do that on an exchange that handles real cash money for which there are much more rules than for other exchanges.  
Like  said: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:25:32
You are either dumb or trolling, or both.
Core is working on the only feasible real scaling. BCH is just trying to cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:20:11
No, you would have to sepa (regular bank transaction). Those are cheap but take longer. But since you sepa to a deutsche bank account it takes just 1 or 2 days from abn amro (in my case).
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:11:10
The fee is not based on the amount of bitcoin you are sending. It is calculated based on inputs and outputs. Also 1 address could be multiple inputs if you received a lot of separate transactions creating the amount you are sending now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:01:46
Keep them on an exchange for a few days.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:43:58
I doubt it: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:16
You can download electrum. I know it has an option to add additional fee to your transaction. I'm not sure about Bitcoin-QT.  
Can you post a transaction id?

OMG. First it was drugs and now bitcoin as well? I'm such a bad person
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:30:29
I also think that is a big part of it, companies protect their interests. But the difficulty and available hashrate should come down. Bitcoin is an energie monster now.

BCH together with BTG is being promoted in telegram groups now.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:36:28
The current problem lies with the flawed EDA (difficulty adjustment mechanism) in BCH. It is actually the only thing they contributed to the source code, next to bigger blocks, and is a problem to both coins. It should be removed / adjusted somewhere today and bring stability.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:01:10

My bet is on people who did the initial pump did the initial dump and thus getting their coins very cheap at the expense of others. look into cloudshare, same idea but i'm sure it was not them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:19:48
And also because they have more than a block per minute. They don't care about trashing the network that made them rich. They just want to be even more rich at someone else expense.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:32:09
Just make sure you use blockchain.info. There was a phising site on top of google for a while called wallet-blockchain or something. Did you perhaps use that site?

Put bitcoins on poloniex during low fee times, and then use their low fee withdrawals to pay for stuff... It's always quick and low fee (0.0001 I think). I always used to keep some bitcoins there just to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:24:51
Can we stop the FUD? There is no problem. People can buy tether and sent it around internet faster than USD can be send around. Also it does not lose or gain value during transport or hodling, like any other crypto would.

I have to come clean at this point. I was hodling strong but broke yesterday night. It was not much but I moved 1 5th of my holdings to an exchange. And yes, I did also sell it....  
It was for about 200 less than what I bought it back for... There was not more then 2 or 3 hours between the sell an buy.  
I'm still not sure what happend. Build up emotions, live people nagging, bills on the doormat.  
So... I'm not really down since I also made a lot of money the last few days... but this is my mea culpa

Just use google and search for 'tether' or 'USDT', and then goto 'tools' and put the period on last 24 hour.  
There really is nothing useful to find except some people falling over eachother telling to avoid bitfinex, tether and bitcoin without any real reason whatsoever. but have a blast and don't forget to rofl every now and again.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:24:31
I think with bitmex dumping BCH before the end of the year and with coinbase releasing BCH in januari you might have chosen a wrong moment to do so. But all the power to you and good luck!

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:08:37
That would take too long for now (future maybe). You could buy/hire some cloudmining but you'd better make sure it is really mining then. And also it could already be mining when you hire it and not really gaining any additional hashrate.

Without really thinking about it I used a new name for myself so I don't have this issue, but can imagine the problem. Changing nicknames and removing accounts might not really solve all that much since the internet never forgets, but it is a good start. I don't know how the internet archive handles social media and forums. But if you have a new name now, no one can link that to your old profiles, right?  
Maybe just relocate otherwise? j/k

Could be the change of the transaction? say you have 1 input of 0.1 btc, and you send 0.02, then you would have 0.08 in change. That usually goes back to your wallet on a new address.

It IS a problem. They can have copied your recovery card or your private keys. don't do this!

Yeah, running a node is not really expensive, like mining, but they do have an important task. Maybe running a node could be rewarded some day if necessary, dunno if that is in the plans though.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:34:18
I think it might be the developers but I doubt it will help short term. Maybe miners like antpool an slushpool that can help most when in hashrate trouble.

No goosebumps but a very good speech for sure. +1
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:36:49
It could be they changed their hashing method and thus your password would yield a different hash. You can't bruteforce the encrypted string without knowing what hashing/encryption they use.  
I would imagine they have some kind of forgot password mechanism that would email you some way to recover?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:27:04
nah, the Olsens.

Well, they will have to close their short positions some day. They will need to do this by purchasing a bunch of bitcoin, so it should go up very fast then.

RSK will give bitcoin smart-contracts, like ethereum has. it is a sidechain that can use the bitcoin hashrate through merge-mining.  
Schnorr would provide greater efficiency due to signature optimization. only one signature needed for 10 inputs instead if 10 signatures.

Just wait until the short positions are being closed. They will need to buy a ton of BTC to do that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:18:23
Hasn't an easy solution already presented itself? China wants miners out of the country due to (off-grid) power consumption and bitcoin ban. Of course they would just set up camp somewhere else, but it does mean they will be busy for a while.  
Also I doubt they would really want to bring these kind of problems to crypto. They would lose all their customers and any goodwill.  
Also startups like Envion might present a nice counter balance.  
I guess a maximum poolsize/hashrate is not a feasible solution since this problem goes beyond pools if they work together behind the scenes?
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:32:51
Open with notepad or something and see if it is text file. If you are in luck it contains the private keys. You can then use any wallet you would like to access the coins.

I might be able to help you with bruteforcing a password but you would need to know the ins-and-outs of what they used for encryption. Could be MD5 or something completely different.  
Although an end of string error sounds more like a communication error with their service.
Maybe you could better try your luck and find out if  could be of some help? I'm not sure what kind of wallets they are familiar with but it wouldn't hurt to find out.  
Also, a CEO providing you an encrypted password sounds more like a joke than anything else... Are you sure he was being serious?  
Also, if we could retrieve your password, would you still be able to access your BTC with that? how many characters are in the string he provided?

I like the fact that banks get some competition. I get zero to 0.25% interest if I save money for a long time, but I pay 15% when I need some more cash than I have for a short while, even though I was never in the red before.  
Banks have been a very valuable thing and will continue to be so, but things will change. As they should already have.  
It will be a more peer-to-peer thing. Savers get more, loaners pay less. Bankers won't all have a fat house and the bank-desk clerk won't even get a company car anymore, if that job would even exist.  
I don't think bitcoin will ever overtake country-money or be a global currency, whatever, but it is changing a lot of stuff but not enough since it got put down.

Before sending to an exchange make sure you are fully verified beforehand. Also maybe use multiple exchanges to limit the risk. Some exchanges are known to lock your funds if they don't trust it.
