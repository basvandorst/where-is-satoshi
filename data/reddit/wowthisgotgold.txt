What about my friend who has been going back and forth with your "support" for more than half a year now because you sent the wrong currency card?

92% of the last 1000 blocks signal for S2X support. The devs opinion shouldn't really matter in that case. Am I missing something here?

Yes sure, nobody actually cares about cheap transactions. All they want is to destroy bitcoin.

Yeah, that was a well thought out response. Do you have any other valuable input to the discussion? I love how you address and eventually refute every single point OP raised. A tl;dr would have been nice though.
On a more serious note: If you really think comments like OP don't belong here, downvotes and report. I don't think any person in known history has changed their minds because they were insulted. However, if you want to actually have a discussion (which, I suspect, you don't) try refuting the statemens made without attacking the person. It makes you look less like an asshole and more like a reasonable person.

Nobody knows. It depends on how fast the network grows, how Moores Law holds up and so on. Look at the current debate - people can't even decide whether 2mb is too much.

I am not sure if I understand correctly, so please correct me if I misunderstood the question. Hashing power has basically no impact on capacity. The more hashing power the less likely it becomes to discover a new block. The network tries to adjust so that every 10 minutes a new block is generated. The more miners join the more difficult (= less likely) it gets to find a new blocks and vice-versa. The "bottleneck" is that only a fixed number of transactions can be stored in a single block (currently 1mb) and that blocks average out to a 10min interval. 
The problem with bigger blocks lies not with the miners - they won't mind bigger blocks. In fact, I would say, bigger blocks are what the vast majority of miners want, based on their actions. The problem is that node hardware is stressed more with bigger blocks. Nodes will need to verify more transactions, send and receive more internet traffic and require more, and faster hard disks (to verify old transactions that aren't in the RAM). The concern is that, if block size grew over time (which it doesn't), or to too much, the hardware and network capacity required will eventually outrun Moores law and thus lead to the count of nodes decreasing (= more centralized network). 


Nobody knows at this point and if anyone presents a different view as fact they are bullshitting.
 Tl;dr: Hashing power has little to no impact on throughput.
Edit: Clarity, tldr

Fuck this other guy. I'm sorry for your loss, shit like this is so infuriating.

It kinda isn't, actually? It's one way to fix tx malleability but there are others like FlexTrans. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:24:22
No, I'm certainly not confusing anything. I'm sorry for not being clear enough. I was talking about signalling [intent]( Looking at the historical support it looks like BIP141 gained significant support together with 2x intent, but not before. Why the hostility towards 2x?

OP never even mentioned Bitcoin Cash.. To answer your questions: No, it doesn't have segwit and no, segwit is not required for LN.

The way I understand it is that the alternatives would have been worse.
1) Immediately drop difficulty by a fixed amount. Not a good idea because it was unknown how much hashing power the chain would get.
2) Don't change anything. Not a good idea because with the limited hashing power it would have taken months to get down to a reasonable difficulty.
3) Immediately drop difficulty based on the X most recent blocks. Not a good idea because this allows "hostile" miners to generate a block every few hours and delay difficulty adjustment.
4) Drop difficulty based on X blocks some time back. This still allows "hostile" miners to delay difficulty adjustment but it comes at a much higher price because they need to consistently keep mining blocks. As I understand it this was the most reasonable path to take.

It's not "anti-core BS" to question their motives. They are not going to go against the company line too much if they want to continue getting paid well for what they love doing and that's frightening to me.
