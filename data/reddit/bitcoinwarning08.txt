Whatever you personally think of me, it doesn't change the fact that I'm right. That is irrefutable.
If you look at the post, you'll see I even correctly predicted where the price would find support and was spot on ($340, actual low was $339.73).
Its only a very small level of support though, I predict we will resume making fresh lows within days, possibly hours.
Itll pretty much go all the way down like a hot knife through butter until ~$260.
My advice to anyone still holding Bitcoin is to get out now while you still have the chance. You may have lost two thirds of your money, but thats better than losing 90%+, and I know deep down you know it to be true but do not act because of fear of missing out.
Let me tell you something: When the real lows come, you will not miss out. They will be around for months or even years. The end phase of a bubble is always the extended period of the price staying at a certain low level and going nowhere - this eventually grinds down and spits out the speculators living on a hope.
Being a smart investor isn't buying all the way down and hoping you eventually catch a piece of the low. Its about having nerves of steel *not to buy* and to wait for the real lows before buying. Otherwise you lose twofold: You end up holding onto losses, and for a very long time (until the next bubble begins, which is far later).

Lol that site is bunk
I looked at it when the price fell to $400, and it first had a prediction for the next few days as ~$440. 10 minutes later is was $420. Now its ~$375.
Its a self-correcting mechanism that doesn't 'predict' at all. It probably just operates like something of a short-term moving average. 'Neural networks' sounds like bullshit to me - do you know what neural networks are, or how they work, or how this prediction model supposedly works? There's no explanation on the site.
Typical bitcoiners.. They'll believe anything.
$339 on Bitstamp BTW.
Also notice how I predicted where the price would find small support and stop dropping, at $340. I was spot on in my prediction.
