Your wrong about its business. It is not about search and ads. It's about data mining.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:22:30
Ads are just a way to monetize data. There could be other ways (PRISM for instance)

Duh, sure they won't be selling the raw data for profit. Ads is just a way to monetize data.
If you understand that the core business is data then it makes sense for them to not embrace Bitcoin, a technology that enables privacy and anonymity.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:40:02
Ironicly true.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:34:34
They urge to be able to datamine the rest of the 5 billion non-connected people.
Data is the new oil.

ASIC technology is stalling.
Hashrate increase shall be smoother from now as it's getting more relative to energy spent.

**Paper wallets**. They are not only for cold storage.
You can print them with small denominations just like cash and the merchant will then sweep them.
You can also use one wallet for your pocket money and another for the change, so the merchant sweeps all your money and then sends the change to your change wallet (that *ipso facto* becomes your new pocket money wallet).

Phone companies cannot get GPS info but android phones **do** send location data to google, along with nearby wifi data (if you enable wifi location, which is on by default, and accept the terms and conditions). That is to keep the google wifi location database updated. Something similar to [OpenWLANMap]( but closed.

Iridium is way more scarce than gold, and they use it for LEDs. It is also cheapier.

Does anyone know any better?
I'm willing to learn how to use changetip for that answer.

Those a the same thing.
A wallet consists of a pub/priv par.
What is a wallet for you?

I've got a copy you gave me at a bar in buenos aires, a day before labitconf. I was the guy with the paper wallets! Remember?

You support criminality whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:44:08
This is partly true due to miners stopping as profit margin diminishes.

Bitcoin nowadays does not have that feature but many altcoins do (NXT, BURST for instance).

From bitcoin wiki: "A timestamp is accepted as valid if it is greater than the median timestamp of previous 11 blocks, and less than the network-adjusted time + 2 hours. "Network-adjusted time" is the median of the timestamps returned by all nodes connected to you."

It would be nice to zoom in that graphs, ala bitcoincharts.
Seems strange nobody had ever done that.
I think I'm gonna make my own.

Avalon4 can make 1TH/s @ 700W
At your rate ($0.10/kWh) 700W in 24hs costs **$1.68**
1TH/s at current difficulty in 24hs makes ~0.0114 coins , **$2.50** at current price (217 $/BTC)
So miners with newer hardware *do* profit now even with U.S. high electric rates
