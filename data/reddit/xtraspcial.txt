Could have used the provided seed to recover the scammer's wallet, under the impression that he is setting up the wallet for himself.  Then set his pin.

If you actually called them Liberals, that'd be a different matter. You didn't though, you said Libs.

So sorry for you. Who hurt you? You must be dealing with a lot of difficulties in life if these are the things you get upset about.
I'll pray for you, but you are likely beyond help.

Good luck getting the whole world to implement environmental policies without some form of socialist policies. Sorry buddy, Socialist policies like the Green New Deal are the future whether you are happy with it or not. Because the alternative is the runaway capitalism that we've seen so far, and unless you have been willfully not paying attention, we can all see it has not been working out well for the majority of the world.

K, whatever you have to tell yourself buddy.
I don't even feel like explaining to you all the ways creating a Green economy will provide jobs and benefit society as a whole because I know it will only fall on deaf ears.
I'm sorry you are such an angry person. I hope you can find peace.
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:26:18
Oh really? Please tell us of the atrocities committed by Democratic Socialist countries.

That comment you are referring to came after your assumption. It is irrelevant.
Initially you opened by saying


again, thats *all income taxes*
They replied saying


Clearly still referring to a percentage of all income taxes.
Then you jump to the wild conclusion that they are saying we need 90% income tax on the rich. No, you are twisting words to sound more outlandish than they actually are.
But maybe you just don't understand how percentages actually work, I know many people struggle to understand them.
You are focused on the percentage referring to the amount taken, while it is clearly the percentage of all total taxes in the country.
Let's break it down. Richy Rich has X dollars. The total tax paid by everyone in the whole country is Y dollars. Z is the tax rate that Richy will pay.
Are you still following?
The ideal situation we should have is
X * Z = Y * 90%
You seem to think that this also means that Z=90%, but it doesn't.

Looks like you misread that one. He didn't say the top 3% should be paying a 90% tax rate. He said 90% of the taxes paid in the US should be coming from the rich, who hold 90% of the wealth in the country. Pretty big difference there.

And I hope you can find a way to move past the hate you have broiling inside you. I'll pray for you.
But it's get back on topic. I find it interesting that you still haven't been able to name a single Democratic Socialist country responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions.
And please, try to see if you can manage to reply without needing to resort to anger or insults.
@_date: 2019-04-08 00:45:06
K, keep telling yourself that buddy.
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:21:09
I'd say you were upset, there is a wide gradient between upset to angry to furious.
But attacks on the intelligence of strangers is generally due to some form of anger.

We need more taxes on the rich and coorporations and more welfare programs
No, we can't do that, its Socialism! Do you want everyone to be poor?
But that's what they do in Scandinavia and they have the highest quality of life in the world.
That's not real socialism!
Ok then, since its *not* actually socialism, there should be no problem adapting their model.
But.. Socialism!?
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:34:30
Uh oh, there ya go resorting to terms such as libs. Once again proving that you are a simpleton incapable of understating points of views contrary to your own.
@_date: 2019-04-08 00:31:40
Except that it does, by the mere fact that it is a modifier word changing it to something different from pure Socialism. Because it is not pure Socialism, thus the need to add a modifier to make that distinction. Why is that so difficult to understand?
So I'll ask you once again. Name one, just one, a single Democratic Socialist country responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people.

@_date: 2019-04-07 22:06:52
Yeah no, you lost this one.
