Me! Before I would just spend all I earn from my part time job on stupid things. Now, I planned out my monthly spending before hand and the rest I just put into bitcoin. This way I need to control my spending which means no more stupid stuff and more BTC ������

I'm transferring from trust wallet to Blockchain wallet. Also why you don't recommend Blockchain wallet?

I'm going to store it on BitPay and there is a 12 word recovery phrase which is also know as the private key and can't be shared with anyone right?

Both on blockchain.com and smartbit.com have 14 confirmation. So it's actually a false alarm on the app right?

Correct me if I'm wrong. So now BTC is inflationary due to the fact that all of BTC is not mined yet. But once the BTC is all mined, it is non-inflationary? 
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:20:49
So you're saying that bitcoin is not inflationary?
