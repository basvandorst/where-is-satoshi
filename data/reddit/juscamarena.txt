I only integrated it which is fairly straightforward and I occasionally help test it out. Real thanks should be to and team for their work on lnd, and the other teams working on implementations.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:16:43
That isn't sustainable and they're already limiting it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:15:52
Haven't withdrawn here lately, maybe that's changed. Hopefully!
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:59:22
Basically, segwit doesn't help that much. Relying on chain is a disaster waiting to happen. You can switch to other coins to provide temporary relief but off chain is where it's all mostly going to have to go to be scalable for small payments.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:52:31
Increasing the blocksize endlessly doesn't work, that's the point, if it did we wouldn't need off chain solutions. Offchain is great as it scales the number of users, but being able to send funds to anyone without needing a channel is something I don't see going away, there will be demand there even with off chain solutions in full force.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:48:41
Gemini is great for buying, but they're actually even worse than coinbase in how they handle transactions. Uncompressed pubkeys, no batching, no segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:09:56
I think there's demand regardless of layer two. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:08:55
Made the first payment here hopefully!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:40:24
Try out testnet, mainnet nodes have many bugs that can lead to fund loss currently :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:40:29
You can try it out easily with just an android phone. 
And yeah, the mainnet site is private currently.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:08:49
There's so much demand for transactions, it really doesn't make much of a difference. As a service you gain the benefits using segwit, not really so if others do due to there being more demand than supply. We're going into periods where the mempool will never empty out. It'll be rare.
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:28:23
Core hasn't yet released full support so they're waiting for a stable release.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:52:37
Works fine here.
Try opening a channel with my node:
        0338f57dd251f2edab6f51ab3b0b7368bf9e5483d97b4393a1d1424fbbeccb5a66

Real bitcoin. I have a mainnet ready version of the site I’ve shared with those I think are tech savvy enough to try it and not worry about losing some money if things go wrong.

Loyalty programs absolutely zero sense.... As it's an ERC20 token how much fun is it going to be paying with another asset and then paying the gas fee for the stupid loyalty token as well? Beyond retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:32:59
No one ever claimed it wasn't a custodial wallet. Jesus Christ. The same dev made yalls and on the wallet page CLEARLY states it's a custodial wallet. Are you too stupid to read? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:55:59
You need segwit inputs before being able to withdraw them. Takes time, they may wait on sweeping legacy inputs until the fee rates are lower as well. :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:19:48
Yes, but it's currently not recommended and will probably lose money at this stage. Try out testnet!
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:55:09
It is. I built the integration for Bitrefill. It’s a private site for mainnet currently. We also have a testnet version anyone is welcome to try here:

You can test it out on testnet with just an android phone here: 
Or run your own full node with lnd.

I like bitfinex. I still think tether is a disaster waiting to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:44:07
I really doubt it. Demand is endless for things like this. On chain still has many benefits over off chain, and I say this as a support of 2nd layer tech.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:46:47
They have been. False article. Bitrefill, Coincards both already do Uber Gift Cards for lightning for ages. (I work for Bitrefill)
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:51:40
On testnet or mainnet?
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:28:50
Can be abused pretty badly. Not a fan.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:34:12
You know there’s a thing called rbf/cpfp. Your app still doesn’t not let anyone in advanced settings at least do any of those thing or even set a fee rate level. Sigh. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:56:19
It isn't much money but dedicated people taking the time to push it forward.

He’s a trump supporter. Not very bright imo.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:19:38
Which is expected. I've been testing LND for almost a year now. It's a lot more solid and fleshed out than when I started. :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:53:30
All of it? Seems overkill. He's probably saving it to give back to you?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:16:35
Mempool isn't empty at all.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:48:19
You can try out a testnet version yourself easily here: 
I don't think it's a good idea to have an open beta yet without extra safeguards to prevent loss of money ready, such as trustless third-party watchers.
If you're a dev it's relatively easy to do this, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'll leave it to the lightning teams developing the implementations to decide on their own when it's safe to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:22:05
I have one here too, but it's absolutely not recommended for any normal people to try it out yet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:15:26
Mainnet is real bitcoin, testnet is the test network with 'fake' bitcoin.

Spend and replace.... if anything having an avenue to spend it let’s you get rid of needing to use fiat. Your interpretation is bananas. Glad to know many disagree looking st people buying from us....

We also have uber eats.

I've used BofA for years to buy bitcoin. Never had a problem.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:04:06
If you actually use it that means fees for anyone that opens a channel to you. So why not?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:58:18
Meh, I'd feel the same way. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:01:05
Working on it!

We offer deposits at Bitrefill if you want to store money there and buy something, we don't have withdrawals just yet but I'm working on it!
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:38:25
I was 17/18 when I started buying and instead of asking someone for money, I just started working myself and putting whatever I could years ago. Your dad did nothing wrong in the slightest.

You can do whatever the hell you want. :)
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:04:54
We have plenty of users that can vouch for us..... We’ve been around for a years never ICO’d either.
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:39:36
Try out Bitrefill, some of our products costs more but that’s only due to it being sold to us at that price range in the first place. Many of our gift cards are sold for the value of them.

Here's an article about it:

More than that. A lot are smaller value that wouldn’t even have been done on chain
@_date: 2019-03-27 23:05:14
Yes, brand new.
Just tried it out myself.
You can still create legacy addresses though, fallback really should be nested addresses, but I guess they don't want bitcoin cash people to send money to that.

We accept lightning for many gift cards for coffee shops in the UK
Not directly but possible ;)
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:29:28
Our suppliers may charge us over face value at times, we are not charging that high of a fee intentionally ever, but we believe having the product is better than not.. We’re always trying to improve our rates.
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:31:57
It’s not the exchange rate, it’s the rate we may buy certain products that are are already over face value, if we could improve the rates for all our products we would, we already try our best to bring down rates as much as possible as well as adding more products.
@_date: 2019-03-28 18:16:22
Airbnb only offers gift cards for US Residents unfortunately.  We’d add other countries if we could.

No, you can create an invoice per donation without an amount set. The sender can specify the amount.

Yeah, I crafted a big segwit transaction again:
Inputs: 854
Outputs: 1
Size: 143.1 kB
VSize: 75.8 kB
Fee Size: 8.60 sat/B
Just a reminder, we are one service, just wait until other companies start flipping the switch to use segwit.
We're doing 100% of all  orders with segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:42:33
It was honestly easier than integrating bitcoin payments, the only thing is it might need more management on the lnd side of things for merchants which isn't quite ready yet, as in optimizing for receiving payments. Still a lot of kinks to be worked out, but it's very promising! The team at lightning labs are great. :) Most are happy to help if you pop into their slack. I'm there too so always happy to help myself.
Is also great for devs!
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:16:05
We're a merchant, We have these all the time. Very similar to exchanges except they have more outputs depending on how they do it. But yeah, if only a few more moved to segwit we'd get the ball rolling!
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:34:37
Eclair and LND aren't compatible yet. They're separate implementations. Hopefully soon they'll start to work together. :)

The one transaction they mined that I made was huge. I don't think many that batch would want to pay the high fees to get included currently.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:33:08
Could have set a lower fee rate, that's cents per order, you must be cheap. :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:51:01
I tried the demo. It's just a fancy front end. Literally nothing on how the actual tech works.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:48:44
I had hundreds of outputs in nested segwit addrs before activation, all safe as I spent them after activation. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:49:57
A fe small SW transactions won't make it go over. Many miners were also misconfigured  
@_date: 2018-10-09 15:05:14
We actually don't purposely close channels yet unless inactive for more than a month, we're fine with having some float. We have some naturally occurring channels that close and we sweep those funds out.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:17:06
Sure, but even a 'direct transaction' in bitcoin isn't correct. You depend on miners confirming it as they are in a way a collection of third parities, just like you'd have multiple channels with multiple third parties. I see your point, but there isn't much difference in my opinion. You're always free to open another channel with another third party or have multiple to select from.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:06:58
Correct, as that uses lnd. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:37:29
It's a bit technical but the first 50 to test it out making a gif or video of it get $20 USD worth of refills. Email to lightning ��⚡️

Our old node was running before the mainnet was officially out. It's been running with several patches to keep it up and has been quite buggy, we moved to a new node to have the old node slowly die off but still function as a routing node until then. Here's our new node, hopefully without having to switch for the foreseeable future [
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:22:38
You should be batching at low fee rates.
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:48:43
If you send from one exchange to another with bitcoin, it's a waste. You can still do this, but why if you can privately without an amount shown deposit into another exchange if you want to? I'm sure much of the blockspace is wasted handling exchange to exchange transfers.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:52:07
I spent blocks after activation, not right after activation, and it was an amount I could lose. :) I knew the risks! Fees are insane, it was worth the cheaper fees...
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:39:52
Bitrefill sells G2A credits as well, we don’t use bitpay.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:19:48
It was a special one time thing for miners to get it over 1MB, I previously paid huge fees a few blocks after activation to do it, but some miners didn't have the proper configurations set which caused them to miner smaller legacy blocks with the whole size less than 1MB.
Here's the earlier one paying insane fees or what would be the norm to get it included with all the backlog:

Basically a website back in the day that gave away a stream or small amount of free bitcoin. At the time it was pennies or worth almost nothing, but since then the value has gone up a lot
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:41:15
It's a good change, you're not forced to make segwit transactions or even mine them as a miner..

@_date: 2018-06-27 04:07:46
We just added gift cards for flight, hotels, and Uber if you're in the USA, as well as some other game related gift cards with more incoming.

How much have you lost so far? :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:53:47
agh! Always gotta nitpick. Yes, not safe in the sense of a reorg, but safe enough for me. :P
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:23:57
Here's the transaction I crafted to get it over. 
Thanks to Bitfury for mining it to have them mine the first &gt; 1 MB block.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:31:21
I work with a merchant. We received all those as incoming payments, and I aggregate them to another wallet in low fee periods. Pointless how? It works. All further aggregations at bitrefill.com will be with segwit as will all incoming payments. Doesn't sound pointless to me at all. It's more for the nerds to be a part of creating a bigger than 1MB block, so in a way pointless, but cool to me at least. :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:01:03
You can over tor
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:21:10
Oh so exactly like mining fees, but with instant transactions for smaller amounts. mkay.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:28:38

They should be they show up here for me 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:30:55
Like I said trade offs. It allows  relatively instant small bidirectional payments to become possible. In exchange you have to monitor those channels once in a while. Seems pretty straightforward to me. Third party can risk losing all their funds by trying to steal mine. Good luck to those that try ��
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:34:23
Is that standard. Never tried doing that with other exchanges.
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:21:28

@_date: 2019-08-15 23:09:41
We’ll lower the fees on that node to match the Thor one.

We're trying our best to add products everywhere internationally. :/
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:17:05
That doesn't sound right, we don't refund to an incorrect bitcoin address, it's refunded by a form where the user sets an address to refund to. Can you share the order id or contact support @ bitrefill to sort this out?
@_date: 2019-02-04 03:34:39
Of course, we're looking at many different ways to reward users especially reoccurring users, that'd be a great one. We do run promos for discounts in that range for certain products we can offer that at times, we'll look into expanding on this.
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:24:17
You still potentially reveal your location or future location to the company, which is totally fine for most people.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:20:00
Well if you want to give your address to a company or let them know what location you’re near go for it. Cool concept and nice 5% discount, though! Gift cards definitely more private.
@_date: 2019-02-15 18:54:31
Amazon is dependent on the country. We do support many of them already.
You can look at a complete list here 
@_date: 2019-02-15 16:58:23
Which ones in particular? Pricing for many may be higher and out of control for some in particular, but we try to improve pricing as best we can but focus more on having as many gift cards as possible.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:17:52
Every gift card can also be purchased with lightning!
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:15:03
Great! We're always looking to add more products, will try to get some of these as I personally would love them myself.
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:07:52
Our buying rates for FR aren't great unfortunately, we'll try and get those prices down. Amazon US for example we have much better rates and sell under face value a bit, Amazon UK just a bit over face value. We believe it's better to have some of these other products even if a bit more pricey than not having them at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:59:10

@_date: 2019-02-15 19:10:13
It really depends on the product being bought. We try and buy/resell as close to face value or under if we can.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:36:30

Well you can do so already buying amazon gift cards from Bitrefill 
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:06:15
We offer gift cards in different countries not just the US, largest selection currently in US, UK but working on other countries!
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:33:43
They should both work with each other. I recently redeemed an uber code into uber eats. If you haven't already redeemed it on either account, they share a balance and you're able to use it for either? Uber is odd, if you are redeeming on a US-based device, and you try to use uber outside the country you cannot use the gift card balance outside the US.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:03:38
Nope, but who knows when they will do so. Getting really expensive to offer that for free.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:03:56
I don't either, but it's nice right after you get paid. You can spread it out.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:11:20
Probably, they're a bit more strict verification wise.
For BTC -&gt; USD GDAX is better, other way around I find Gemini to be my go to. I don't like to sell so first one is pretty useless to me.
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:07:30
We already have flight gift cards. [
Should work if you buy it form the US site from any country
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:18:31
They should at least allow withdrawals to segwit addresses, would make it worthwhile for other wallets to do the same at least, why would wallets go full bc1 if you can't really send money from anywhere to them.

I find it odd how miners that were in support of SW were still mining on F2POOL when they were on the fence on which direction to go: BU, or SW. It's slightly a bit worrying that miners are apathetic in decision making themselves.

My friend messaged me this haha. Worth almost double that now.

I have asked multiple times Zander why he didn't incorporate compact blocks. The response I got is he preferred xthin... When I asked why with all the issues even when they were claiming it was better than compact blocks he said:
tomz [12:25 AM] 
the problem with xthin is not the design or the origin. The main problem is that there is no specification.

When we all know it's a design and implementation issue...

BW hasn't mined a block in 20 hours.. Maybe some hash power diverted, or maintenance? 
@_date: 2017-04-24 07:09:20
Honest question. Why are you running BU?

How does bitfinex have less than a say than bitcoin.com or bitstamp?

I am too, there are already plenty of other alternatives. I also like tinkering with bcoin, or running btcd to test out the lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:30:36
Steam is international. It works in Canada. It's just priced in USD or Euro :)
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:02:21
Satoshi included a higher limit for a reason. If miners can continually increase the blocksize upper limit: they can push out smaller miners hurting decentralization, make it harder for most people in the world to run a full or pruned node among other things.
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:43:00
Gambling games I think. haha. Vital to the industry!
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:21:38
Yep, hopefully on mainnet soon. ;)

It won't always be 1 satoshi per transaction... Fees scale by amount.

Current release is targeted to developers, easy to use lightning mobile wallets is something many are currently working on!

Just short hand. Hard to fit into existing payment method schema. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:10:30
I've had this same issue before.
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:04:02
It’s not 20 a month, we also may leave it open a lot longer if the channel is active, it’s just the worst case if we need to close it out for some reason.
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:16:20
See all ya’ll going there!
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:53:19
Those don’t work with mobile wallets only public nodes. We want more liquidity providers though! More is better to kickstart the ecosystem. :)
@_date: 2018-11-03 01:01:37
Yes, make sure you’re correctly inputing the seed  and passphrase. I’m not near a computer but can verify what I did by tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:52:33
There’s also the issue that I can’t connect to the node unless you’re port forwarding hence the script to connect to us first before opening the channel. UX gets even more complicated at that point. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:22:55
I think there's a minimum balance needed to be on one side, after the channel balances out a bit more it'll be able to send back and forth just as easily, even better when I can rebalance channels after creating them.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:29:20
If you country isn't listed at the very least our international products will work like steam vouchers.
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:12:05
Yes, they can.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:29:48
I can switch, no problem. :)
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:02:25
It's a known issue at the moment. Don't worry we know! There are some cool ways of doing refunds over lightning that will be implemented soon.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:25:46
Total channel amounts in bitcoin for all channels Bitrefill has open.  The amounts on our end is a subset of this capacity. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:18:42
Remember it matters more that you run it yourself, you don't even need to be running it with ports open. Many businesses run nodes that are publicly connectable.

We don’t sell stickers or t-shirts?

Fair enough. Probably a good idea to keep that functionality a beta for devs.

@_date: 2018-11-22 17:02:09
I think it's overcapitalized at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:56:31
Consolidation transactions are suspicious how? I made one for segwit with 1090 inputs 1 output, 140kb -&gt; vsize 99.9kb. Spam? Nah
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:02:41
It doesn't have xpub style address generation yet, but still pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:22:18
Nice! I have it on bitcoinjs-lib, but I know people that need it with python!
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:31:24
Well some devs need it merchant wise. I don't have/use a trezor but there are ways to show segwit addresses of an xpub to avoid having to use bitcoin core and have keys in a hot wallet. I did so with bitcoinjs as no one else had a guide up: 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:44:59
Bread doesn't have a fork with BCH yet. You proved my point. One exchange supports BCH, why do people ask other exchanges for it? . . . .
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:52:02
To be quite fair and clear, BCH already has a forked working version of bitcoind working, so of course no one will be asking Bitcoin Core for support.

I’d rather wallets upgrade to parse lightning invoices
@_date: 2018-07-01 23:45:04
Exactly, Bitrefill for example has 3.4 bitcoin capacity, on 1ML it only shows 2.94 bitcoin, as it doesn't include private channels I can see myself.

It started off as a April Fools joke, it took no more than a few hours of work, but then people surprisingly actually use it for small payments so we keep it around!

Here you go!

We did that as the initial value, we can extend it to more than one month if there's demand. What's the range you wanted?
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:41:05
They don't route, no reason to include them in the graph of routing nodes. More privacy, maybe you want to open big channels but privately with another company and don't want to publicly do so. many reasons.

I'm at dev  and I see countless payments a day with lightning. . . Maybe for something not online 24/7 it makes less sense, but for merchants that are it's easy. Eclair is also releasing a push only lightning wallet that will make it even easier for regular users to safely use lightning.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:18:24
Here's updated instruction on paying with lightning on bitrefill using the eclair wallet on mainnet!
Can try out buying a steam voucher worth 5 euros or 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:18:22
I believe these nodes are hidden and create 'private' channels which will not show up on the graph intentionally as they don't route.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:45:18
It's up here? Was only momentarily down for a few minutes at one point here with others paying for invoices here.
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:35:55
Who did you open a channel with? 
If to eclair's node they've probably topped out of capacity at the moment.
Opening a channel to mainnet.yalls or bitrefill or a couple other nodes like rompert's should have enough capcity to bitrefill.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:05:11
All implementations have a flag to make them private, Eclair Mobile only creates private channels, lnd gives you an option to set that flag as well. Not sure about c-lightning. All it means is that the node won't tell other nodes about the channel like it does with public chans.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:09:52
That's an outdated paper. 
It's so much better in the current scheme.
You'd have to have a malicious unilateral close from a previous state. The timeout would start there when that transaction is mined..... Which at that point you'd be able to mine a penalty tx stealing their funds. If say it's a week or two weeks that's plenty of time..... 
I personally would have a full node watching at all times, as well as a VPS instance that outsources channel monitoring, as well as other services that would watch. You'd have to DDoS my node, as well as find out where else I've outsourced monitoring, and on top of that you'd have to do it for the entire duration of the timeout after a unilateral close. If you can do that successfully that'd be a site to see, and you probably deserve the bitcoin I have in channels. I'd have to be stupid to allow that to happen. I'd also do it for free, or at the very least monitor for friends and family if they don't...
Whitepaper is outdated, here's a better link with the current state of what LN would look like:
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:36:43
I don't think so, it'll probably remove them if they don't' signal BU after the current stats period ends. (last 1000 blocks)
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:09:10
Okay, before you freak out, does the history tab show anything?
If not try entering the bitcoin address you entered in the ATM on a site like 
The receive tab gives you a new address when you've used the previous one, so that's expected behavior.

@_date: 2017-05-05 06:43:53
Umm, seems to be your fault. You don't save the private keys, you save the HD seed which can derive those keys. And it seems someone was able to access your keys. Did you use a passphrase?
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:40:08
Cool so you've made payments without opening a channel to us directly? Awesome!
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:19:51
If it's not time sensitive, you can just wait. If you really need the money now in your electrum wallet. You can right click on the transaction and pick CPFP to pay a fee to have it confirmed. (make sure you have updated electrum)
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:00:19
They have been doing this for months. It's incompetence. Maybe they should fix their software and mine like Bitfury who rarely if ever does this crap.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:22:47
Update electrum if you haven't, and set rbf to true. If it doesn't confirm fast enough you'll be able to bump your fee up.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:23:31
I wouldn't recommend buying 2nd hand trezors. lol
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:55:01

Yes, easter egg. Please go back to @_date: 2017-05-07 10:24:43
Who cares, at the very least what we're seeing is segwit works just fine on alts. All the hate from the other side is just FUD.

@_date: 2017-05-13 05:32:07
Do you realize not everyone thinks that? I want both..... But not a BU style EC uncapped miner controlled blocksize. Madness.

Too early, that's only with majority of people running it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:17:03
You could have enabled the coin control feature, and not sent the small spam outputs? It's a useful setting in electrum!
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:03:24
Can you really count coins that are set aside? There a shit ton other shitcoins that do the same that are also worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:16:40
It isn't slightly better. It's better in almost every way. I'd rather see better standard wallet UX so it all happens in the background... You'd also be against Flextrans too then? I hope so. :-) xThin is pretty pointless and buggy as fuck, basically any non-Blocksize change BU has made is pointless. Even EC, we should strive for a non-contentious backward compatible block size increase in other ways as much as possible: so segwit..... Let's break almost the majority of the software from working just for a breaking HF blocksize increase change..... I love your reasoning, you should apply it to blocksize increases as well.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:49:26

Umm, presumably he's in Korea, and his money is in KRW?
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:42:25
Nah, it seems it isn't a priority to move them either, he can set a low fee and can afford to wait, and use rbf if it ever becomes time sensitive.
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:22:35
We're not even worth half a Buffet yet, how lame.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:34:31
They should really batch up transactions or offer the option and go the way Polo does to save on fees unless it's absolutely a priority.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:17:55
Umm, how about lets assess how safe it is and how the network handles the capacity increase with segwit and we go from there...
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:22:06
0.14 also has HD wallets, which 12.1 doesn't, he should also upgrade there.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:14:36
Does that one get a lot of volume?
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:53:14
Coinbase please enable all outgoing transactions to be used with RBF, or at least give the option in Advanced Settings.

If it's for asicboost that's a really bad incentive to have......... As for orphan problems that'd probably help the argument to not increase blocksize??
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:58:51
By the way, it doesn't 'get sent back,' their node and your eletrum server's node probably dropped it from the mempool due to the current backlog, someone could, in theory, rebroadcast it. But yeah, you can totally just resend and then use CPFP, I wouldn't recommend coin.space, glad you're going with electrum!
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:55:57
What wallet did you use?
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:09:20
Bitfury is in. On the core slack he was talking about it on the  channel. It doesn't look good. I'm thinking it's a new deployment, he didn't see to want to answer that question.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:38:49
What's on ETH that'd you even use? ENS is pretty cool, but other than that a lot of projects are working on both RSK and ETH.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:08:28
Well isn't it 'illegal' to use it for payments in China anyway? That along with cheap online money transfers between other people in China.

Set RBF to always be on, and just bump it if you have issues with confirmations.

Well, then I think the article should mention that haha....
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:01:25
I'd make a backup of your wallet.dat first. It shouldn't delete your bitcoin at all, but it's always a good idea to have a backup anyway. I'd be more worried about your HDD failing.

@_date: 2017-05-13 05:52:19
EC is untested garbage. Why do you want it on a 30 billion dollar system? Segwit works fine an alts, even one with more than 1 billion dollars of value. What complexity? Most of the code is tests what every implementation should have........ It doesn't 'need' to switch to new bitcoin addresses you can use nested addresses. Overall we should switch to the superior bech32 even without segwit.......
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:36:23
Yes, same here.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:26:30
Are you using blockchain.info? Switch wallets. Try out breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:55:12


Well, we need to hear more details, if anything it could be a MAFMASF. Miners forcing the current deployment of segwit to be activated, if it's not that it doesn't sound like many people that actually understand bitcoin on a technical level that agreed to this.
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:01:39
Anyone that ever says this, I know to disregard as a total idiot. Talking out of your ass without proof. I'm there and I see no such thing.
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:59:40
Do they really not do dynamic fees even now? wow
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:16:55
Cool, thanks for you input. I agree.
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:42:40
Total fee is meaningless, what really matters if fee/bytes paid.
In your case you paid ~79 sat/bytes which is under what will get mined in a timely manner due to the huge influx of backlogged transactions paying a higher rate.
What wallet do you use?
I can try to help you not have this issue from now on.
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:01:51
Hey man... I think these are accounts intentionally being stupid to just waste your time... People can't be this dumb. (I hope) It's also a new account, probably a sockpuppet, I wouldn't even bother with these people.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:14:14
Electrum, set rbf to always so you have no issues with transaction delays.

@_date: 2017-05-05 00:48:41
Pretty good. They ask for KYC stuff, but they have instant USD deposits with limits which is pretty good for me. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:32:32
Yes, but if you need funds urgently at a certain price, your order may never get filled! For those with patience, it's pretty good.
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:36:17
What wallet do you use? I'll try to help. No, you won't lose the coin.
I can probably guess you're using the blockchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:21:55
Okay Ken M, but good luck getting everyone to agree.
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:37:18
F2POOL is signalling segwit you know that right.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:21:52
The thing is in this model, it only takes one honest individual to close monitor and submit a penalty transaction. You don't even have to trust that they'd do anything malicious, and you could do this with mutliple people/companies behind the scenes. I'm not so sure SPV wise, but you could monitor if a certain tx has been in a block right? In that case outsourcing channel monitoring is only the last resort for specific edge cases since most clients would check themselves in the background automatically. Edge cases: Say you get into a coma, or are offline for a few weeks. (You'd probably close out channels before that though)
Note: this is all still in development, so it's still a bit early.
For example, I'm pretty sure many companies would do this for free who have a vested interest in bitcoin succeeding like coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:24:44
There is no counterparty risk...
How is observing that nothing malicious occur in order to not have to etch every transaction on chain a bad thing? I find that it's a great tradeoff. Simply pouring every single transaction does not scale at all.
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:43:06

Can you clarify? I looked into it briefly, but as a current full-time student without a job for this final stretch, my income will most likely be 0 this year. Are you telling me I can sell a portion of my long term held coins for 0% right?
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:57:26
If you look at the current state of the mempool you're paying 132 sat/bytes,and to be included in the next block you'd have to be at 200 + sat/bytes. It'll probably be mined after a couple of blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:26:50
I'm not sure about mining, but please point your pool toward one supporting segwit such as f2pool once you start mining!
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:18:14

@_date: 2017-05-11 05:12:43
Of course. We're still in the early stages, though so it'd be best if it were mainly devs at this point.

If you're not in the position to gamble your money away, I would not put ANYTHING in. If you have money you can afford to lose, then put that, otherwise please don't. No one can predict the market, we may all be mostly bullish here, but I'm going to tell you straight out it's always possible it will crash hard and lose a good chunk of it if you need the money and are forced to sell.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:55:26

He's been on board :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:05:00
Move your money to electrum, it doesn't look like coin.space lets you set the fee? Electrum has dynamic fees, and you can set rbf (an option) to always so you can bump your fee if an outgoing transaction if it doesn't confirm quickly. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:46:13
Why? Those that don't own bitcoin and want a secure way to store them can now buy a trezor first.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:46:44
Not easy to use or understand for most people, and would probably be expensive with backlogs push up fee pressure.

Do you need help getting it confirmed? Have you updated to the latest version of electrum?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:25:44
Yes, it does!
Also for the transactions you've sent out, you should set rbf to always and use that instead for outgoing transactions and CPFP in the cases where you can't use RBF.

HF segwit isn't even that much different from SF Segwit. That fixation is quite odd that it's okay as a HF, but not as a SF. IMO you still need support for older transaction types at some capacity to avoid invalidating time locked transactions. I hope people see segwit is a 'complexity' worth adding as signatures should have been segregated from txid calc from the start.

Lightning is great, but it's just a bit too early to use it on mainnet for regular users right now.
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:29:37
Open it with and see what's inside. Might be a private key. (I wouldn't share that, if so you can tell by the first character) 
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:04:35
BIP44. You'd have to make a new wallet. Basically backup your old wallet.dat. Create a new wallet, grab an address from the fresh wallet.dat(make sure to back that up too), and then send from your old one and you're good to go.

On GDAX? Always use multiple exchanges. I use GDAX/GEMINI here. Pretty good pair. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:17:56
Well they gotta start somewhere, they gotta learn their ABCs.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:13:16
It'd be interesting to see how they messed up!
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:21:49
Hey, I didn't say it wasn't stopping necessary transactions as well. haha
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:28:21
I've been hearing that for years.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:46:25
 I agree with keeping it bc1, but there's nothing wrong with seeing the opinions of others. I didn't realize a week old issue that most people haven't even seen settles it? News to me. I'm seeing more seeing it's unnecessary so +1.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:06:16
So you're going to 10x the capacity without first testing at 2MB, 5MB or anywhere in between to see how it handles it on mainnet? You're insane.
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:42:30
That's stupid and would slow down development. It's intentionally separate as it doesn't deal with any consensus code.
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:34:36
Green for next block or two, yellow for a few blocks, and orange for low priority, eventual confirmations.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:01:38
By the way set RBF on to always, if you ever have another outgoing stuck tx you will be able to bump up the fee.
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:02:36
So basically you're a Luddite, who makes an opinion without trying it out? It all makes senses now.
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:52:36
They can. They'd just fork off, which is good because they don't soley decide the rules.
@_date: 2017-05-05 04:23:22
Sweep them up with a low fee. Small transactions aren't feasible right now in that model. You should change it to weekly or something until we can scale up.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:20:30
Too many people using it. We're hitting all time highs here, so it's probably due to very high traffic. I'm seeing the same here.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:37:50
Honestly, I think it's preferable this way than using another token on another network entirely.
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:47:40
Where in Norway?
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:32:32
There have been Whole Foods gift cards purchasable with bitcoin for ages
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:58:01
anddd that's why you shouldn't keep money on exchanges.

ECDSA also has one running UASF for electrum in the list.
ip: ecdsa.net
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:12:05
It doesn't matter. You can set something really low like 2 satoshi/byte and it'll be confirmed eventually. Sending to a long-term paper wallet isn't time sensitive. Well, that's what I recommend. If you're using electrum, set rbf on, and set a really low fee. You can always bump the fee if don't feel comfortable it being unconfirmed for so long. (no idea why you'd mind in this case)
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:42:49
Ken M of the bitcoin world!
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:32:46
Umm, what?
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:26:16
Yes, it's time.. People are dumb enough to buy alts purely because each unit is 'cheaper.'
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:22:25
Why even bother lending them I mean.... Most are shit.
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:44:13
Of course, but directly you can for now if patched, and I believe Eclair has it as a config option to allow routing over the current max almost all nodes have. Parent comment wasn't about payments but untrusted nodes being able to create huge channels to us.
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:48:47
If it didn't use blockcypher it'd be a lot better. Hopefully they have a plan to move to neutrino when that is ready...
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:47:32
We do target and have an app :)  nice to see more competition!
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:07:27
Great, glad you had a great experience using us!
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:30:35
I'd rather work in parallel, everyone has their own interests etc.
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:15:32
They allow withdrawals? Nice.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:08:24
Has anyone ever made money with cloud mining? As far as I've seen they've just been getting more fools to throw money away.
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:35:23
Yes you can just need to give your drivers license I believe
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:50:38
Sure, give me one second.
Disable recovery phone, and recovery email. Only do recovery email if the other email as non-sms phone recovery and use 2FA itself.
That's for gmail, not sure what email you're using. I also recommend you use a crypto only email for stuff like this.
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:02:43
By the way, I hope you have your email set to google auth style 2FA and removed the phone recovery option. (YOU WILL LOSE MONEY OTHERWISE, Due to phone porting etc)
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:22:17
You can use it without exposing keys to the host computer, with a flash drive if your computer were comprised and you actually used bitcoin, you'd lose all your money.
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:35:41
First, make sure you update Electrum. Next go into preferences and set rbf to always. Are they incoming or outgoing transactions? Either way you can use CPFP to speed up confirmation, and for further outgoing transactions that get stuck you can use rbf.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:58:46
Why would you take a picture? That's bad, anyone with that picture can steal your funds. But you have one last hope, try  maybe your android? phone backed up the photo there.

Their chicken nachos are amazing as well.

Wow didn't even know this was going on! I would have participated, great to spread just how cool lightning is.

Connect the dots, he sold it to you...
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:12:27
We’ve had gift cards from many companies like Bitrefill (I work here) that have many of those listed. Gift cards are much more private as well and don’t require us to hold custody of funds.

He does, but not 148, other types yes.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:20:03
Have you updated? That fee rate seems odd.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:16:20
Why even bother for alts.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:39:04
They have to pay to move deposits too you know.

I did a level 2 a few days ago, verified in less than an hour.

Yeah the bit. 2x signals the original too.

What made you buy a 2 year contract?

Are you me? Except I didn't have a bank account and no way to get them so I moved on to other things.

Lol it's 0.1% daily dude.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:15:34
Random nodes if you have the patch as well.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:08:40
Nah, I have a 10sat/b that's been in limbo for 14 days, I can wait, aggregate my low-value UTXOs! Still waiting lol
@_date: 2017-06-05 06:12:16
No, sounds like a security nightmare. Money is at stake here, hiring just anyone would risk funds.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:39:17
Ah, next time you should run core with  -walletrbf so you can bump up the fees if you need to.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:22:24
Easiest solution is to open a decent size channel and spend a bit from it from a few merchants and then you'll be able to receive.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:39:46
Amount of money spent isn't the factor here, it's the transaction size.  Both sides are pushing for solutions, the fact is it's too little to be included fee rate wise, either wait or bump the fee. Yes, it sucks, but that's the current reality.
By the way, another big factor is the parent transaction is also unconfirmed, but at those fee rates both wouldn't get confirmed. What wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:28:13
Did you try rebooting electrum or connecting to another server in preferences?
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:10:27
Yes, google authenticator doesn't move to another phone, if your phone # is hijacked.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:57:20
Can you clarify?
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:01:28
One is on an app known locally to your phone. SMS 2FA uses you phone number, which would be usable to anyone porting your phone number to your other phone. The first one is secure and someone stealing your phone number wouldn't be able to access your account.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:29:15
I wasn’t part of the team at the time but remember fold fondly even before I joined Bitrefill glad to have ya back! I envy ya’ll having Starbucks!
