Great job!
How much would something like that cost to make for another domain?

Dear Kraken-JPJ,
Can you please do me a favor and solve my ticket nr. 1114637 as well. 
I believe your automated system thought that they are duplicate since they had the same amount. However, they are not duplicate. I have transferred the amount twice, since I saw that the market was going down and wanted to purchase more. So there was no mistake in it.
Please help and release my last two payments and credit my account so I can purchase some of the cryptocurrencies. 
Many thanks in advance.

Dear Kraken-Frank,
thank you! It is highly appreciated. I have received a message that my ticket was escalating to Urgent Status.  
However, two days after your message and in total of eight days after my transfer, Kraken has not credited my account with the deposit I did.
If they treat urgent statuses this slowly, I can imagine how slow will be treated a normal status.
Once again to clarify, I have filled the Reference field with my public ID, in a similar way as I did in all the other previous bank transfers to Kraken that were successful. My Bank has also told me clearly, that this is an automated process through e-banking and no teller was involved all the fields that I filled were transferred automatically to your bank. They double checked and confirmed that the Public ID was transferred to Kraken as well, in the same way as in all previous successful bank transfers that I did with Kraken. I have also send Kraken a proof of the bank swift, where they confirmed that they received it and that they see that the Public ID was there in the Reference field. 
In the mean time, my money is still in Kraken account and I cannot use it! 
Total disappointment! 
I have really had a good faith in Kraken, but not anymore after this treatment.
Please help!!!

I checked with the Bank, and they clearly told me, that the Public ID was transferred to Kraken during the bank transfer. They have sent me a bank swift, which I forwarded to Kraken where they can clearly see that the Public ID was in the Reference field as it is required by Kraken.

Thanks Kevin,
Ticket number is 
I constantly keep updates that your agents are working on it, but unfortunately it has passed 8 days now and I am still not able to use my deposit. 
In the mean time, prices have gone up :(
Anyway, thanks for coming forward and I really hope they will solve this today or latest tomorrow.
