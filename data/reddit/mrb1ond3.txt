Guess who I'm not voting for now then. Pick some someone else less retarded Hilary!

ITT: kncminer PR trying way to hard to cleanup their mess...

Not sure why the down votes, this is a reasonable, and on topic statement. As well as it's likely you are correct

Can't hurt to diversify a bit bro.

Good on you for running! Being a bitcoin advocate is only half the battle. Don't succumb to briberies, and keep your morals straight, whether you win or lose.

For anyone that's ever been to a college bowl game and seen the hundreds of vendors, and booths, initiated by their sponsor pre and post game this is a really big deal for exposure, probably one of the best I've ever seen! The publicity and exposure will be huge!

TIL cheap air accepts bitcoin? I'm on next flight to NYC for a short bitcoin funded vacation...

Wait, it's illegal to own gold?

Came here to suggest this. Us companies aren't allowed to do business with certain countries. Bitcoin IS global,  but bitcoin businesses still have to operate within their respective countries laws.

I wouldn't put it past the US government to use the Silk Road as an excuse to secretly confiscate and possibly even destroy 800k BTC. A currency that the govt is obviously wary about in the first place, all while acting under the guise that they are indifferent or supportive of the bitcoin protocol. If they could get away with what they did to mega upload, I don't see this as being any different. USgovt are a bunch of shady scoundrels, and I think they have a lot more to do with this Issue as what's being shown currently. Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but it's entirely plausible.

Haha/ I'm not much of a gambler., the occasional. 5 or 10 buy in and sometimes I get lucky

You did the math. I like both the technical and the theoritical side of the discussion 
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:23:34
I want to clarify I was mining a lot last year and making about a btc a month, eventually my 3 290x and 2 Gtx 770 weren't turning s profit. 
I make about 80k/year with 10% after matching. In the 401k. Single no debt, no bills. The $100 a month isn't killing me. 
I have about 10 btc currently. Just wondering how I should treat this "minor" investment for me. And looking for conversation and opinions

Yes. Let's consider a retirement package that includes Bitcoin, is it feasible? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 06:39:52
I have both, thanks for the educated information though 
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:45:39
I'm not really into trading but more of building a digital currency retirement portfolio. 
I consider really 5-10 digital currencies serving a purpose. In the the next decade, it may match or even supersede 401k investment. It may not. However, why not discuss the possibility? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:34:28
So I don't know where to start? But let theoretically do the math on how much Bitcoin I need to buy to match or beat my 401k? 
@_date: 2015-11-07 03:27:42
I like you're detailed response! 
I have a 401k with 10% total of 80k/year. 
I am putting 50$ a check/100 a month into Bitcoin. Regardless of price. 
Opinions on return in 20 years are good to discuss in comparison 
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:46:25
Yea 10% altogether goes to my 401k. Only 100$ a month going to btc
