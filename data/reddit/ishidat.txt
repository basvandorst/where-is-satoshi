@_date: 2018-01-27 22:34:55
It's a type of human filter, their target audience are ones who don't read properly and just click the link.

@_date: 2017-03-01 12:34:04
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:40:16
Yea, because Jihan forgot to pay his cloud server bill for a month, so they shut down all the nodes at once.
@_date: 2017-01-11 02:22:38
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:23:19
It's actually in color, you may be colorblind o.O
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:49:51
Where do you see Litecoin??
@_date: 2017-01-17 01:50:42
Nothing is Asic resistant
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:39:21
They can just run Pruned nodes
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:47:09

@_date: 2016-12-07 11:19:14

My Prediction: Bitcoin will be $983.45 in 2017! 1JwNUY87BcotyFXgWRBLH13hoiRMnedJwu
@_date: 2016-11-12 15:02:15
Visit  to get started, they originally were called Btc china, but are now global!
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:02:42
But how many?
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:45:01
Why is it pathetic?
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:48:11
I googled, "How to make money leaving your computer running all the time" and there it was, Bitcoin mining. I was 15 at the time and had a single 5870.
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:21:51
Btc address? 
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:45:05
A decision should come no later than March 2017.
@_date: 2016-11-12 23:01:20
Looks great!
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:37:42
I thought that was Lightning Network ?
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:50:17
I was thinking about dedicated servers when writing the question, thanks for the information though :)
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:04:23
You can send 0.00000001 btc
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:08:51
Thanks for the most helpful answer here!
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:02:29
IT's very slow though. Especially the home page.
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:24:00
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:44:00
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:33:39
Just use localbitcoins + a desktop/mobile wallet to buy sell and store bitcoins, not really that hard..
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:18:10
Lightning Network would make these guys go out of business.
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:15:01
Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, haswell
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:28:02
The chinese guy said that and he owns one of the largest ASIC companies
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:30:52
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:06:52
best comment sir
@_date: 2016-12-18 15:58:53
I wouldn't persuade others to invest in Bitcoin because they will blame you if the price falls and think you're selling them into a ponzi scheme. I would however (and do) educate others about the benefits of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-23 13:06:04
That's pure bullshit lol, stop worrying OP, and to OP, if you tell them what the transaction was for, even though they will probably close your account, they will still give you access to your money, but if you deny any knowledge of the transaction, they will close your account and keep your money too.
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:20:39
We don't need segwit to activate LN, as long as transaction malleability is sorted, we can activate LN.
@_date: 2016-12-11 20:18:56
They have to pay though.. The other two machines have to pay in order for you to get it for free
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:29:20
Exactly, But Bitcoin mining would still be attractive because as the Price increases, it's overcompensated for loss of fees before LN
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:19:58
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:26:04
of the Willy Bot manipulation (Mt.Gox)
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:17:16
@_date: 2016-12-18 03:34:30
No, i wouldn't trust it. They might be using stolen paypal accounts.
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:23:42
Yea it's possible without segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:55:33
Now it's only $15 more than market price.. XD
@_date: 2016-12-21 13:10:06
I like how you told him bitcoin is "created" in china, because it is created in china by mining (which he probably has no clue about), but the actual Bitcoin code, we have no idea where it was created :p
@_date: 2016-12-22 13:37:54
She engraves a privatekey on your forehead with a sharp object.
@_date: 2016-12-18 03:23:46
Are you joking? They don't even have Address validation, paypal address validation, extremely unprofessional.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:59:43
Electrum all day :D
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:59:37
Lambos have a Corsa mode lol
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:45:24
Why would miners drop out if Bitcoin rises it would overcompensate them for the loss in fees
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:55:30
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:24:31
Yea I currently have 12 connections, been running for 3 days
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:27:41

Right at the second, he almost says Our ability Control the dollar
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:04:48
Lightning Network allows "**INSTANT**" trustless anonymous bitcoin microtransactions limited only by bandwidth, not block size, yet still secured by blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:08:58
they make $130million a year so 400mill isnt bad
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:16:03
How much did he send?!?!?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:04:36
