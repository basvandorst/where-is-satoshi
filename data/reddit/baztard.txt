There is another option: take some of your bitcoin and invest it in other cryptos. Diversify.

One can easily force a dip with bitcoin though. Remember the massive buying just before 10k? If that was the banks investing their money in bitcoin they can force a dip by just selling that amounts quickly and make huge gains.
If you have a lot of fiat you can kind of steer the bitcoin price.

It is the exact opposite to what Bitcoin stands for and once such a system is established it will be much harder to get rid of. So no, this is actually bad for Bitcoin.

A house is a completely different thing than a college education.
And things don't go up in price because there is more money. Things go up in price the harder it is to obtain them.

How is the price for a house artificiality inflated? Of course it is necessary to borrow money. If I want to buy something that I can't afford, it's not because I'm too poor, it's mainly because some things just cost what they cost because they are hard to manufacture. In your world, how would a house suddenly cost less if the work and materials required still cost the same? And how would Bitcoin change that?

Well...except Monero.

Last time they started making financial products based on bitcoin that's what started the drop from 19k... I'm sceptical about banks touching bitcoin.
