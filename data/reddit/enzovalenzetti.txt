No, because the problem right now is demand. There's enough companies and they function reasonably well. The problem is people aren't buying their products.

No, they're two distinct concepts. The financial crisis was a problem in finance, that led to things like a credit crunch. Money lending basically stopped at one point. That problem was mostly dealt with. 
Compare it to the EU that is still very much struggling in this area.
The substandard performance of the US economy, which we can call a depression, doesn't really have a lot to do with the financial sector any more. It's mostly a lack of demand. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:02:03
The financial crisis is over. But the US economy is still in a depressed state because of a lack of demand. 
Only real way to solve this is to increase government spending. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:52:18

Overstock filed a lawsuit against the hedge fund Rocker Partners in 2005, for libel, unfair business practices and tortious interference, saying it colluded with a research firm, Gradient Analytics, in short-selling the company while paying Gradient Analytics to publish negative reports about Overstock.com and supplying pre-publication copies to Rocker. Naked short-selling was not alleged in that suit.[32] In a conference call with analysts in August 2005, a day after the suit was filed, Byrne said that "there's been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock, drive it down to $6--$10 ... and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up." He said that the conspirators were part of a "Miscreants Ball," headed by a "Sith Lord," who he refused to identify but said "he's one of the master criminals from the 1980s." Byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds, journalists, investigators, trial lawyers, the SEC, and Eliot Spitzer."[33]

Central bank is prohibited

Late last year , the central bank had a series of moves to prevent the risk of bitcoins , and the latest news shows , the regulatory wheels are still ahead.
Informed sources told the " First Financial Daily" recently, the central bank has issued a document requiring banks and third-party payment agencies closed platform over the territory of Bitcoin trading account .
The insider also revealed that not long ago , the central bank has also had meetings convened to discuss how to further strengthen risk prevention Bitcoin , the meeting had mentioned prohibiting commercial banks to provide services for Bitcoin transactions.
"If the document was true , the company's bank account might be sealing , we can only take things one step in. If the user trust us , maybe take personal accounts remittances ." Kang Ling , vice president of bitcoins China in an interview with the "First Financial Daily" interview.
However, some industry insiders suspect that such a policy can be implemented really have . Network co-founder Du fire coins are on the "First Financial Daily " said: "Maintaining the current state , the bank can all be found in the water , our accounts are also real-name system , if regulators want us to carry out anti-money laundering obligations , we can put all the data , pull out the water to see , but if the company's bank account turned off , and that all transactions are transferred to the ground without it? difficulty of such regulation even higher. and now from the last period has only 20 days , and we have not received the message , so that the user will not be so unfair ? "
Du fears were justified , some industry insiders said the document issued some strange paths , many organizations and individuals associated with such operations have not received these documents have said .
"Our website is currently operating normally, did not receive the relevant information ." Bitcoin trading site OKCoin founder Xu star said in the " First Financial Daily " interview . According to the website of RMB recharge OKCoin trading tips , the site currently has a bank card payment and recharge cards in two ways . Bank card payment can also be achieved either directly go to the bank counter remittance services through " transfer" feature online banking , a total of 13 large banks in OKCoin column can handle bank remittance , the payee is limited AnyMusic Beijing Network Technology companies, remittance of RMB will be confirmed after artificial recharge to a personal account.
The OKCoin of TOPUP is paid to a third-party game called Coin265 platform recharge recharge card purchase points , the corresponding number of points you can buy all kinds of virtual currency Bitcoin , including in the station , including , recharge cards advantage lies in the immediate arrival. Currently OKCoin website provides bank card payment only supports more than 1,000 yuan remittance , remittance of 1,000 yuan prepaid card is required . To provide third-party payment service agencies , including the tide payment Limited.
Late last year , the central bank had interviewed more than a dozen third-party payment company official , it may not be explicitly requested to Bitcoin , Wright credits (LTC) and other trading sites to provide payment and settlement services ; and provides for the payment of business organizations should have occurred lifting cooperation , the latest models in stock to complete the withdrawal before the Spring Festival , the new payment services shall not occur . In this context , many Bitcoin transactions are beginning to seek new website recharge manner similar TOPUP form "bypass" access , not only to avoid the direct contact with the third-party payment bitcoin , but also to achieve rapid recharge.
"In fact , this connection and recharge bitcoin trading site pages ' Bridge ' on only one thing , that is selling the card has no other real business ." Person in charge of a home bitcoin trading site told the " first a Financial Times " , where he also used the trading site in the same way , regardless of the payment of the purchase through a third party is called game points or game currency, are essentially the ultimate goal is to buy bitcoins or other virtual currency.
As for the " blockade" bank transfer pathways will become an obstacle to recharge Bitcoin transactions, insiders said that the first look at the dynamics of policy implementation and, secondly, to see whether Bitcoin trading platform can come up with something like " bypass" coping tricks . In related news , but apparently has begun to affect the price of Bitcoin , as of press time last night 9:00 correspondent , bitcoin prices have fallen on the BTCC nearly 10 percent to 3,300 yuan each .

You hit on the big problem with bitcoin. It's a currency that is limited in its amount (so a theoretical bank couldn't really loan beyond its means) and it's deflationary, so no one really wants to loan out money anyway (as keeping money increases its value over time).

"I mean, they were only kidding that you had money in your account."
You don't seem to understand what a bank is. A bank doesn't promise to keep your money in an account. As a depositor, you are a lender to the bank, and the bank gets to do with your money whatever it wants.

"A real run on the bank."
The whole point of deposit insurance is to prevent bank runs. There's also really no point in securing against bank runs on every single bank in the country. It would require a ridiculously large and unnecessary amount of money. That's where you require backing by a government and the central bank, who do have the necessary funds to act on a systemic crisis.

2. A Great Deal of Hype Surrounds the Investment - check (look at Google trends)
3. Everyone Seems to Be Ignoring the Fundamentals - check (barely anyone one is buying stuff with this currency, plus there isn't any serious increase in unique transactions)
4. This Time It’s Different - check (look at people discounting that this is a bubble, even though Bitcoin already had a huge bubble in the summer of 2011)

We must be at the "delusion" state. ;)
Bitcoin, while hilarious, will inevitably settle at $0. It may happen next week, or next month, or it may continue on for six months. The only reason to pay anything over $0/Bitcoin today would be in an attempt to turn a quick profit before that happens, but it will happen, once the joke passes (or another joke coin more "in the moment" comes along). If you get seriously burned by Bitcoin, though, you only have yourself to blame.

No, what you are trying to do is taking the market behavior of a piece of technology (and I'm guessing you're talking about the price of a certain piece of technology, you're completely unclear about it) and comparing it to a currency which is a completely different thing. 
So, by your own admission, Bitcoin is deflationary. This is a really bad idea. As it'll make people hoard money, and not buy any Bitcoin products. Meaning that producers who sell products for Bitcoins will make less money. Which will lead to those producers to lower their prices (even more deflation) and pay their employees less Bitcoins. At which point these employees will save even more Bitcoins as they become even more valuable to them. Which means they will buy even less Bitcoin products, etc...

And online shopping is more or less just an extension of the mail order catalog. Who knows, in an imaginary world where the internet didn't exist, the volumes of mail order goods might not even be that much smaller.

Less regulation means more profits for these corporations. Sad to see you fall for it. The United States performed excellently for decades with things like the Glass-Steagal act, until it was repealed to allow banks to make massive profits, and at the same time endanger the world economy. Denying there has been massive deregulation (especially in the financial sector, is just silly):

Sure, but these are relatively minor changes when it comes to how you live your life and how the economy works. Internet isn't unimportant, but it changed a lot less than let's say the inventions of the automobile, telephone or electricity did. We can imagine our current world more or less surviving with no internet. It's a lot harder to imagine a world with no cars today. So if you look at the actual impact of the internet on the economy, it led to serious growth in the late nineties, but then it collapsed. The US economy had to be propped up by a housing bubble afterwards, and it since has never really returned to the high growth of the late nineties. So the economic impact the internet supposedly has had, really isn't there in the numbers.

Dude, stop trying to inject facts. 
IT'S LEGAL. TO THE MOON.

Whoa, what just happened here?
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:36:35
Maybe the market crashed, and too many people are trying to sell/convert and the magic the gathering online exchange doesn't have the money?

Neither of those two things require the amount of computing power being devoted to Bitcoin at the moment. Only a fraction would suffice to process transactions.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:16:22
Up! Up! Up!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:10:36
Bitcoin, safe and secure.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:36:11
Then it all crashes and they lose a shitton of money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:06
Be the laughingstock.

The whole point of deposit insurance was to prevent bank runs and protect depositors. That the Bitcoin community considers this a bad thing reveals how ignorant and crazy they are.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:39
Because everyone is selling their bitcoins. That is why the price is dropping.
It's now at $75 as far as I can tell.

You're going to lose a lot of money.

Just stop listening to libertards.

Time to sell. Cover of Time means the Bubble is almost about to pop. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:29:50
You do realize that bubbles don't pop over the course of 24 hours, right? The last bubble took five months to fully deflate.

And if someone would create one, it would have no protection at all. Not even the deposits under 100k.

Celebrate 100 years of a functioning currency.

Keep on rationalizing and lose all your money. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:23:15
Wow, you are a terrible friend.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:06:05
Yes, it has happened before. It could crash any moment, and you'll lose all your money. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:16:19
Let's keep the ponzi scheme going.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:58
Why do you want to impede on the free market?

No, Visa is not a currency, it's a payment method.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. 
And as a payment method, it sucks. There are much better alternatives that are much more widely accepted. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:50:02
How dare someone have a different opinion on Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:37:34
That's not how currencies work. That's how stock market bubbles work.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:42:18
You shouldn't. The bubble could pop any day, and you could lose money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:14:45
Just another great buying opportunity guys!

I liked the ones with Ron Paul on them better.
