That's nothing like a decocracy. A democracy is one person one vote. You're confusing decocracy with market.

This looks like an infographic that will only be understood by someone who already understands the thing it is trying to explain.

\# isn't a hashtag, it is a *hash*.  is a hashtag in twitter, because it is a *tag* which twitter denotes using the *hash* symbol.

It's far worse, because the money supply, at least in principle, has democratic oversight.

No. Someone said he can't even write Hello World, so he copy pasted Hello World written by someone else.

People posting their charts aren't trying to predict the price, they're trying to drive it.

That's not what phishing is.

The median lifespan of currencies which failed due to hyperinflation.

Looks like your wife's playing away today dude.

He was accused of not being able to write Hello World specifically. He didn't choose that to show off his skills.
It's like someone accusing you of not being able to play a single chord on a piano, and sending them a clip of a single chord being played. Then it turns out that you just grabbed a clip of someone else doing it.

There isn't one.
The central planning was a rapid industrialisation strategy used by peasant economies to 'catch up' to already industrialised countries.

I didn't say it was good, I said it wasn't phishing.

You're not going to convince people, because they think they are the fat cats who can sit on the profits, because they got in early.

But it isn't a fake site, it's a real site selling a scammy product.
At worst it is counterfeiting. But selling counterfeits online isn't phishing. At best it is misleading advertising, which also isn't phishing.

Bitcoin doesn't have 80% even if you only take the top 2 into account.

No. "Tipping" people fractions of a penny and filling up the comments with bot spam is annoying enough even in this sub.

If you're talking about "monetary inflation" then you shouldn't compare it to the central bank "inflation" target rate as if they are the same.

I just sent you a few bitcoins. Hope they reached you OK.

More likely they saw an ATM and thought they'd bust it open and steal the cash.

I think they might be deliberately conflating the two concepts.

Can someone grab the bottom? It looks like it has fallen out again.

I don't doubt it, but which countries?
@_date: 2018-12-04 06:05:32
Bitcoin is *less* stable than the Argentine peso, not more. It is 80% down, not 50%.

Who's going to be paying the electricity bill if you decide to start mining bitcoin?

This is a terrible quiz. It looks like you are just prompting them to repeat factoids that you barely understand yourself.
I think you need to go back to the drawing board. 
1) Start with a list of things they **need** to know.
2) Make sure that they are actually true. i.e. not just terminology in a specific community, or about specific transient technology, or are just opinions.
3) Make sure that you actually understand them. If you don't, go back to step 1, do they really **need** to understand it if you don't?
4) Write questions that unambiguously interrogate their knowledge of those (probably few) remaining facts.
