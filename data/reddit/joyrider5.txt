Yes that is a good idea.  I think its a little erroneous to pretend bitcoin isn't private.  Buyers and sellers on the dark net have been getting away with using bitcoin for a while.  And the amount of people getting busted for using illegit torrents is tiny.

Sure.  I think a side chain/alt coin would be more appropriate, or lightning/tier 2.  I want it however necessary.

I've saved &gt;$3000 on purse according to my account page on purse.  So I have been through the ringer.
Basically when I buy something, I decide how soon I want it... If I want it really soon, I use my girlfriends prime account directly 0% discount.
If I need it soon but not emergency, I put discount at 10%.
Then depending how I feel, I will put my discount anywhere from 10%-20% and see what happens.
I am not sure how purse works exactly, but I've done 10% quite a few times and it ALWAYS goes through right away.  It is set up to only give the best buyers that price or something.
I have dealt with the shit the OP has dealt with, and that is why I rarely try more than 15% anymore.  Not worth it at all.
Also want to say that some buyers are pushy as hell and give bad ratings unless you finalize the moment the package arrives.  Seriously, cool the fuck off guy give me up to 24 hours.

Cutting off remittances totally would be difficult and less fruitful but is a good threat.  I expect something like this happens instead:
a) TAXING (not stopping completely) remittances makes perfect sense because illegal aliens do not pay taxes and over utilize services like the E.R. because they do not have insurance and are more prone to uncontrolled chronic disease (diabetes, hypertension)
b) this would be good for bitcoin because bitcoin would be a way to get around the taxes for the immigrants
c) regardless of how you feel about it/trump the reality is that it would be very easy to make mexico pay for the wall, trump has a multitude of ways he could do this.  Of course, I do think obama is right in saying that damaging their economy could also hurt ours.  But they have a lot more to lose and would probably succumb to our demands (ie it is worth doing)

I'll throw my two cents in; I have been following BTC since 2011 and more active part of the community since 2015.  I traded BTC exclusively all of last year (full time).  I'm known for my posts on bitcoinmarkets sub, daily point and figure charts, momentum analysis, and bot programming.
Flibbr is among the top people I trust online re: btc.  Enough that if there were reason to (ie. opportunities), I would trust him with a significant portion of my finances.  I have spent years listening to him on whalepool and nothing has ever hinted that he has alternate motivations.  He is independently wealthy and has had many opportunities to shill and profit but has never been interested in doing so.  He has vested interest in maintaining a good reputation and seeing whalepool thrive is clearly important to him.
As traders we must assess risk/reward of using these exchanges for trading and lending. 
As community members, we should encourage decentralization.  USDT is a central point of failure that even if the company has our best interest at heart, can be attacked (by government, for instance).  There are decentralized alternatives to USDT, such as bitUSD, which I really like and I hope more exchange incorporate.  I don't hate USDT.
Edit: Wow can't believe I wrote that "USDT could be attacked by government" an hour ago then suddenly: U.S. regulators have subpoenaed Bitfinex and Tether.
   Too bad I didn't trade that prediction :/

If you change the supply from 21 million that is a fork and it will have a different name than bitcoin.  You'd really have to have all the 100's of wallets, 100's of exchanges, and 100's of miners conspire to fork while retaining the bitcoin name.  
Near impossibility as of now, but if one or two exchanges and one or two wallets and one or two miners monopolize the market, it could happen.  This monopolization of wallets, exchanges, and miners would have to precede a change to supply.

Nice attempt at framing Andres as part of the drama. ;-) Who do you work for?  The CIA?  The FBI?  NSA?  Fess up.
His quote:


I think he is referring to US-associated groups.  That is why he would mention the US infiltrating communists; ie during the cold war.
The other way around is true too of course.  He isn't too worried about the USSR infiltrating bitcoin community right now since they no longer exist, which is probably why he used the example of the US infiltrating communists instead of visa versa.

moral authortarian + appeals to emotion with simple, misleading talking points
Best way to combat this is to go after him hard on a moral level right off the bat; "ROGER VER you are a convicted criminal who is no longer allowed to enter the United States, many people call you a scammer for visiting Mt Gox and telling people it is safe and solvent hours before we found out they have stolen all our money.  Why did you create a coin with such a similar name to Bitcoin?"
Do not ever try to talk technicals with people like Ver.  Put them on the moral defensive immediately.  Ignore or interrupt them when they try to push the conversation to their talking points.  Exaggerate their negative qualities to create emotional feelings in the viewer and if they make the mistake of correcting your exaggeration, back track just a hair on it but keep on that topic (their negative trait) until they force a change the subject.
Roger Ver is especially suspect able to getting angry (instant lose in a debate).
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:24:41
You are joking right?  There is nothing logical about Roger, he is all emotion.  Anyone with an ounce of logic and a heap of technical knowledge knows that he is an idiot.
He has been convicted of crime in past.  He has been denied visa in the past.  He plays audience on their emotion and on their lack of technical knowledge; you have to go for the throat for people like this to frame the topic of debate.

Short and medium term it is highly speculative but fundamentals do affect long term (&gt;2 year).  The issue is that with high uncertainty and no clear way to turn fundamentals into a price, bitcoin will be highly volatile even over entire year periods.

The reason that bitcoin price does not clearly follow fundamentals is because it is not a company that earns money.  It is a protocol, a network tool, and it is the first protocol to have a currency attached to it.
Since bitcoin is young, there is no explanation of how to turn fundamentals into a price.  Hence the price is volatile and fundamentals are not useful on short or medium term trading.

Over 5% of bitcoin mining is by parties acting on personal interest.  These miners must:
1. See adoption slow because of full blocks (as opposed to fees just going up, which benefits them).
2. See bitcoin price decrease and perceive this as being due tofull blocks and/or segwit failure.
Otherwise, they will simply enjoy higher fees.

There is so many new and low information investors that it plays right into the hands of those benefiting from BCH's high inflation rate and oscillating difficulty (due to asymmetric emergency difficulty adjustment).
Upset that they 'missed out' on bitcoin and 'cant afford' bitcoin they turn to 'less expensive' alts including BCH, regardless of quality of dev support, quality code, or presence of malicious miners.  This sort of mania is dangerous to the entire space.

You do pay more with visa, but what happens is visa has strict rule that business' cannot charge more for using credit cards than cash.  Shadier places will do a cash discount at the risk of losing their visa contract (often good too if they are involved in tax fraud). 
 DMV is one of the few exceptions (and part of why DMV used to be check only for a while).
But trust me, you pay for it.  Visa is collecting 1-3% of the sale.  Most sales are done by card.  The business passes those cost on to you.  1-3% adds up big time.  Make sure you as a consumer are using a 1-2% cash back card at least to get some $ back from these vampires.

By definition, the way the difficulty changes work, there will be equilibrium reached.  That is how the difficulty works for both chains.
But while finding equilibrium, it can overshoot in both directions and swing back and forth.  There will be periods when blocks are mined less than every 10 minutes for both coins.  The first time this will happen to bitcoin is coming up now.  A lot of fear about this, but likely we will simply see higher fees for a 1-4 weeks.  This is simply the technicals of a proof of work system.
We have actually seen this before with alts that share the same type of proof of work.

I don't really see that happening.  Bitcoin won't make such a big change and still be bitcoin on the other end.  I will tell you though I hedge my bitcoin holdings with holdings from Proof of Stake coins.
Im listening to Dan Larimer from BTS/bitshares talking on epicenter podcast.  He wants to take wasted money away from miners (proof of work) and giving it to the users and to devs and marketers for the chain.  It makes so much sense to me just clicks 100% in my mind.  If bitcoin fails itll be because proof of work fails.  Sorry for shilling, I love bitcoin, but I think its greatest threat is the proof of work system.  If there is one part of bitcoins protocol that will prove to fail it is proof of work.  Certainly the money could be going somewhere better than building chinese asic bricks and wasting electricity.  As far as I am concerned, Satoshi made 3 mistakes:  Asicboost exploit, transaction malleability exploit, and the proof of work system.  But proof of stake has been hard to tackle so I understand that it wasn't put together back in 2009.

I'm thinking segwit will get us another 2-5 years before we really need a blocksize increase.

I think 2mb is too much right now for the network, more than needed and unnecessary potentially harmful to decentralization.
HOWEVER, I will concede that it will eventually need to be done and promises have been made by majority of hashrate- companies whom should be professional enough to not break promises.
I also recognize that the enemies of bitcoin wish to have us divided.  Which is honestly the most important thing in my mind because I REMEMBER WHO MY TRUE ENEMIES ARE.
Now here is the hard part, **which camp do I join in order to keep the community from becoming divided?**  Ha ha.
Hopefully a lot of other people are wondering this as well.

ETH and alts have been around a few years.
Bitcoin will be around for millenia.
You and I might not even be alive to see the world unfold, but I hope I can watch the rock that is bitcoin put to shame every myopic copy of it.
The only better currencies than bitcoin are those who decentralize further, work on fixing bitcoins fungibility, miner centralization issues, and work on scalability without sacrificing fundamental decentralization.  I have respect for those alts.  Anyone can create an alt with a larger blocksize or shorter time between blocks and market it as the best thing, doesnt make them right.

If you want no limit blocks then go with an altcoin and see what happens to its nodes.  Bitcoin is decentralized.  Bitcoin protocol has a cap on block size.  That means the blockchain is and will always be small enough for anyone to hold a copy and verify validity of transactions if they wish.
Do you seriously believe no blocksize limit coins will survive the test of time?  What if government goes after them?  What if we hit the physical limits of our current processor and memory storage capabilities?
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:03:54
I think its a great example of how it is impossible to have complete consensus.
I do not want a 2mb fork yet.
But that is what we are getting from the miners, and since I recognize we will eventually need a 2mb fork and I find it to be reasonable, I will accept the 2mb fork as bitcoin as long as nothing major changes.
I think there will be people who push a PoW change, such as lukejr.  Much like the bcash fork, I think the PoW change fork may be harmful to the community, but an inevitable result of decentralization.  If I am happy with the new PoW strategy taken and the naming of the new coin I will not sell it.
My biggest fear is not these forks, my biggest fear is that community division is being driven by the enemies of bitcoin, ie divide and conquer.  Right now I see the most toxicity coming from people like Roger Ver.  I think we should all lean towards staying together even if it means you aren't getting 100% what you want.  I don't want big blocks, but I find 2mb to be acceptable block size, and I appreciate how difficult it was to get jihan and other miners to give up their use of asicboost and transaction malleability exploits and support segwit and compromise had to be made.  The real problem here is not the compromise: **the real problem is the glitches in original bitcoin protocol (asicboost and transaction malleability) and the compromise is the solution to these glitches that has the greatest chance of keeping the community intact against its enemies**.  Thus I hope the community supports the compromise segwit2x.
Another driving factor to my support of segwit2x is I do not think miners should go back on their word.  If they promised something they should go through with it, period.  This is professionalism and ethics.

When Richard was talking about the things wrong with BCH: lack of devs, last second planning, childish wix website-in-a-box, poor code quality, zero conversation happening on mailing list, etc etc...  Ver totally ignored all of it except he latched onto the point about the wix website driving the conversation into a deep analysis of how good or bad wix the company is.  Richard totally fell for it too.  He should have brought it back to BCH's lack of developers by saying 'wix website requires no programming skills and BCH chose it because it has no programming power or decent developers' but instead he got wishy washy and was like 'err umm theres nothing wrong with wix but umm wix is just really easy uhh yeah it looks professional... but its not professional beause its wix... and they have commercials on youtube uh which means ummm it means that its for new companies...'

Thank you for agreeing Hillary deserves to be locked up.
I will now explain why trump doesnt.


Trump pays taxes to the full extent of the law.  All Hillary's major donors, like George Soros, also use loss deferment and other tax loophopes to minimize taxes.  They all have accountants that advise them on minimizing taxes.  I also minimize my taxes by following my CPA's advice, for instance I write off a portion of my home as a home office.  Trump pays taxes legally and fully.  Trump doesn't have big donors telling him what to do so he is more likely to close these loopholes than hillary.


I have a shaddy contractor who didnt finish work on my kitchen and I wish I didnt pay him. Trumps built more buildings than almost any human who've ever existed.  He most definitely has not paid contractors because they didn't finish the job.


Obama just reopened borders with cuba and I am all for it.  Good job Obama.


Complete lies.  It wouldn't have happened if Bill or another male democrat ran against Trump because those lies could be said of any man, including you, and it would tarnish your rep.


More than MSM is being caught in bed with Hillary:
I think the newest came out today...  CNBC 'journalist' asking hillary campaign what questions he should ask republican candidate during interview.

BCH is getting a block every 1.6 minutes right now.  The difficulty adjustment in 2 days from now will, in theory, change that block time to about a block every hour as the profitability plummets.
That is fine BCH can survive with that it will just be a little slow.
Compare that to IOTA which also is a bit slow right now but expected to get faster over time.
Not end of the world for bcash.
For next two days, bitcoin is running a little slower than usual, looks like we are getting a block about every 20 minutes.  It isn't great but in 2 days we'll get a readjustment and whatever.

 But you will pay because Bitcoin is worth it.  :-)  Nobody goes to that restaurant, the lines are too long!
And you will use teir 2 services like lightning in future because that will be worth avoiding the fees.  And lightning helps with fees without hurting decentralization of the Bitcoin Blockchain.   Yay!
Meanwhile BTC is the decentralized honey badger, it doesnt care about what the fees are.  Fees are based on demand + blocksize.  Blocksize is not dependent on fees.  Community consensus is the only thing that can change blocksize.  It would take much much higher fees to create enough pressure on the community to come to a consensus on blocksize increase.  Maybe in 1-3 years.

Strong argument can be made that Hillary and Obama policies has directly strengthened the Islamic State, for instance, we've (arguably unknowingly) directly given them massive amounts of money and weapons then said "whoops".

What he says still stands since investors are irrational and are mislead to believe that what they buying are bitcoin when in fact it is not.  They simply haven't done their homework.  It could take several forks, time, and a lot of money lost before investors realize that copy cats are not Bitcoin.

Consensus is arguably when enough of the users agree therefore the price of the original coin drops to a number close to zero (lets say &lt;1%).
Otherwise the exchange is stealing money from you by not letting you access your real bitcoin.
By other definitions of consensus we would need the vast majority nodes, miners, devs, users, exchanges, businesses, wallet developers, etc all supporting the hardfork.  But IMO users are all that matters, all those other groups fall into the category of users and are not special.

Creation of new tokens into the USDT treasury wallet doesn't matter.  The treasury wallet is not backed up by USD it is a dead pool of USDT to be drawn from.
Any other exchange could just as easily be lying about who has how much USD balance and whether it is backed up by money in the bank.
If you have evidence the company is operating fraud then you can report them to Hong Kong police or make money by short USDT on Kraken (which trades about 1:1 but would eventually crash if USDT is fradulent).  But you cant because you don't because they aren't.

I recently sold 90,000$ worth of bitcoin on coinbase.  Had some SERIOUS PROBLEMS with them.
a) because I used coinbase proper instead of coinbase exchange I was hit with &gt;1,000$ in fees.  They would not give me a cent back.
b) bad customer service
c) I took the 90,000 out to pay downpayment on a home.  The bank wanted statements from coinbase and coinbase customer service was unable to provide.
d) If not for family helping me pay my downpayment (then I paid them back in the money I took out of coinbase) coinbase's lack of monthly statements or any kind of legal documentation at all would have lost me escrow.
e) I took all my money out of coinbase and told them I'll never go back.  Right now I am in Gemini and Circle mostly, with some altcoin in poloniex.

Anyone can edit bitcoin source code and run a client that does not follow the original protocol.
Satoshi does not think miner's have the power to decide on maximum block size.
The community decides, together.
When bitfinex and bitgo created Bitcoin Unlimited tokens, they sold 1/10 the price of bitcoin.  Because nobody wants it.
When Jihan tries to push EC, the community pushes back because we don't want it.
Satoshi is just 1 person.  Why do you keep talking about him like he decides what is best for bitcoin?  The community decides.  Satoshi is one small part of the community, and so are you.

Great question.  As far as im concerned, this is the order things need to be done (all at once is fine):
1. disable asicboost exploit
2. fix transaction malleability 
3. increase transaction throughput via segwit and/or blocksize increase
The reason I support segwit is that it does all three without a hardfork.
I am ok with hardfork because it is needed (lightning will need bigger blocks for onramp/offramp) in the future HOWEVER from what I am reading, 2mb is being activated BEFORE segwit, which I think is a big problem.

It sounds like you arent familiar with asicboost.  Asicboost is an exploit that risks the network security to get 20% faster hash.  It was not intended to exist and it creates an incentive for those who use it to delay upgrades to the bitcoin header protocol.  Cryptocurrency relies on miners incentives to do what is best for the network, such as upgrades, and asicboost exploit ruins that incentive.
It isn't about 'faster miners' etc.

Jihan is being misleading.  Locked-in is not the same as activiting.  Both will be locked-in.  2MB hardfork will activate first, then support for segwit activation will fall (because of some excuse Jihan comes up with).

Once we get code it will be too late for segwit in august or a uasf.
Based on what they are saying about 2mb fork befor segwit activation... The code will likely say 2MB hardfork first, segwit *maybe* in a year or two.  Then Jihan will use an excuse to never activate segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:57:40
Yes, that is a great point.  Those who have better technology would start their own chain.  That is why drawing attention to poor quality forks is best done by purposely creating 100's of crap minority forks.  This will discredit any other planned forks.
I think a small team could create 100's of minority forks including 2x, 4x, 8x, EC, etc etc forks.  Then when someone whines that we should fork to 2x, 4x, 8x, EC we can point to the minority fork that is worth almost $0 and say 'there you go'.  A difficulty reset would be needed but no need to change anything else.
Having 100's of failed forks around will help remove some of the FUD surrounding a fork.

Viabtc wants your passport and phone number to withdraw your bitcoin.  Don't do it.
I know its tempting bc BCC is WAY too high right now and its a great short opportunity but just wait for a method American's can use to offload their BCC you'll still make some money ala byteballs and lumens.

Bitcoin derivatives could fuel the bubble cycle that already plagues bitcoin.  Many people will be wrecked and insiders and traders will be happy and there will be much rejoicing.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:14:23
I would sell all of it now but they don't let Americans trade on the only exchange doing a futures for BCC.  Passport # and cell phone doxxing required.  Oh well.  By the time it becomes tradable on a decent exchange it'll be just another semi-worthless shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:40:06
Great :)  Smart move dipping your toes in crypto.  This market is very inefficient lots of $$ for the taking despite the large fees.  Most popular exchanges are bitmex (use out of us vpn) and bitfinex but if you want to trade the extreme shit coins you'll need bittrex or poloniex.

Looks like it activates 2mb hardfork which does not kill asicboost.
Then in &gt;1 year, after the hardfork, we *might* get segwit.

Quality programming can be quantified, companies and educators do it every day.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:54:43
We need some actual code.
Until there is real code being promoted, I have to assume this is all delay tactics from Jihan to continue raking in huge fees and using covert asicboost.
The code needs to guarantee segwit before a 2mb hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:02:06
Segwit2x will still activate a block size increase in 3 months.  85% of hashing power will go to this block size increase if miners hold true to their promise.  15% will either follow along or attempt to keep alive the shorter 1mb chain.
Divide and conquer.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:01:28
The agreement doesn't say segwit first.  It says that this agreement is based on the original Segwit2Mb proposal, but it doesn't say it follows the original proposal's segwit first.

Best case scenario, he hung himself because almost all bitcoins were encrypted and he knew he would be tortured for the passwords.
Likely scenario...  Pretty much every/any form of corruption and murder you can imagine.

Can you specify where you believe the bottom, top, and resolution of each bubble was?  That would help us communicate
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:33:37
Bcash doesnt even have its own chain yet, lets start counting the hash rate when aug 1 comes yeah?
Will likely fluctuate A LOT at first because of BCH difficulty adjustments will make it very profitable then very unprofitable to mine back and forth until equilibrium is reached in price and hash power.
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:21:23
LTC and ETH are also vulnerable to this sort of take over, sadly.  Enemies of decentralized currency would love for users to be spread across cryptos constantly having to leave because of in fighting.  It is exhausting.
Not sure what the solution is though.  Maybe ETH's proof of stake system will help.  I also like the DCR and GBYTE models.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:41:59
Bitcoin belongs to everyone in the community.  UASF can be safely used to put contributors in their place when they start claiming they are 'the law'.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:24:25
How could it be a democracy?  You can opt out of bitcoin.  I can't opt out of US law.  Even if I leave the country they'll come after me for taxes.
If bitcoin goes in a direction I do not like, I will stop using it.
I already have actually, I am diversified into Decred because I hate bitmain and what they have done to bitcoin and I see decred as being resilient to that.  I also have some other alts like dash, xmr, eth.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:04:17
check out r/bitcoinmarkets and whalepool teamspeak.  If you are trading 4 hour candles then you probably want to check before and through 1, 5, 9 o'clock.  1 day candles close at 5pm.
Also watch where quarterlies close on bitmex and okcoin there's often a pump around those.
Trading is 24/7 though.  Most people use alerts on tradingview or another site to wake themselves up and/or interrupt eating etc when chart needs attention.
Whatever you do, dont trade with meaningful amounts for at least 5 years.  During the first 5 years of full time daytrading, 90% of traders lose money.  You WILL get wrecked.  Good luck.

The users need to be on the same chain, period.  Miners and developers are just tools.  Users use what they want, or if they don't like it they don't use it.
Miners and developers can create FUD and confusion that breaks the bitcoin community into pieces and delays bitcoins growth, but nobody can stop bitcoin.  They'll be hundreds of minority forks within a year, the code to create minority forks is open source and is being developed right now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:29:43
Yes.  I too support 2MB + segwit.
But Jihan doesnt want segwit.  He is pushing 2MB activates first, then segwit *maybe* activates.  They'll come up with an excuse to not activate segwit because Jihan is making millions every month using exploits that segwit fixes.
Core roadmap is segwit first because it fixes transaction malleability and asicboost exploit and gives us time to test hardforks.  Then 2MB.  Jihan hates this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:35:37
Jihan only has to create semblance of risk and they will drop out of segwit.  Bitcoin protocol is first and foremost risk adverse.  Miners do not want to mine orphaned blocks.  Exchanges do not want angry users.  Users do not want the price to crash.  Nodes do not want their nodes to go offline or be useless.
Example: mystery pool (of new miners controlled by jihan) appears and segwit loses 80% support after 2MB already implemented.
Example: Jihan hires fake expert to say the new segwit code isnt good because it was written hastily so he must withdraw his support.
Example: "we dont need segwit anymore because 2mb blocks cleared the mempool just fine alone!"
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:51:36
Any exchange without KYC is now money launderers.  Period.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:13:08
Bcash resets the difficulty after 12 hours of no mining I do not think they will have a problem.  There may be some volatility with time between blocks and that volatility could wash over to BTC as well a bit if miners are actively switching to the most profitable chain but it shouldn't affect price.
Nobody is going to be making real transactions on Bcash anyways.  Just people sending their BCH between exchanges to sell.

This is going to be huge.  I would like to get in on this somehow!!!  I'm a programmer PM me.

Anyone thinking miners are doing as agreed should reread point 5...

I tried listening to their episode with Roger Ver, but his horrible lies and hate made me feel ill.
I do not hate the show, I think they are entertaining.  And I do not mind they talk about altcoins a lot, I like to keep up on altcoins and I hold some.
But when they have losers like Roger Ver and Craig Wright on it makes me cringe.  Wow.  Cant believe people are actually listening to this and agreeing with it.  It is like they have no technical understanding of bitcoin at all.  Roger Ver discussion made me cringe even worse than when the host pines about his ex-girlfriend.  You are somewhat funny man, but that shit is pathetic, you are embarrassing yourself and it isn't even entertaining.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:33:18
With what software?  There is no good code for that hardfork as you describe.  How are they going to develop and test it in time?  This takes months to do.
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:01:04
If all else fails, a new crypto currency could be built with quantum computing.  The initial coin would be dispersed to those with proof of stake in Bitcoin, thus expediting it as the quantum crypto currency.

Throwback to 2014... I wonder if anyone has a link to the 'bitcoin on sale' guy where he attached lower and lower prices to it and he looks sad.

Yeah what a loser how dare he warn people.

@_date: 2017-07-07 23:27:45
This is really well said.  Until we have hundreds of shitty minority forks though, this will always hang over bitcoin.  Probably the best thing to happen is for the growing pains to cease by creating hundreds of minority forks all with different block sizes and different properties.  Then the community can really decide which is bitcoin.  Spoiler: It will be the original chain.
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:17:58
Alright where do I buy it?

That is because people are tribal and expect virtue from their enemies but display none when virtue contradicts their own self interest.
Critical thinking and philosophy is left out of K-12 curriculum for a reason.  Because tribalism benefits the elites and freethinking hurts the status quo.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:31:16


Seriously?  Most of your arguments make sense but this one is laughable.
@_date: 2015-10-09 07:20:33
These guys sound good they look good and they make Bitcoin look good.  I've liked them long before they got into Bitcoin and hope they become the face of Bitcoin for the dumb public and media, because the public and media will never 'get' that Bitcoin is a totally decentralized protocol.  They want a face.
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:19:29
Sure.  The core github doesn't always have to be where new bitcoin code is written if something else better comes along (it hasn't).
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:36:33
2mb hardfork is promised within 6 months.
segwit activation is ?? whenever jihan decides.  probably never lol.  but hey they promise they'll do it sometime and they are going to 'lock in' segwit when they do 2mb fork.
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:07:45
I mention it in passing in positive ways then wait for them to come to me.  Usually in reference to either purse.io, foldapp, how my savings are in technology but not stocks and how much $$ I've made, or how I do my part to not support the big evil systems (fiat system, animal industrial complex).  Response is always way better when they dive into topic instead of having it thrust on them.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:06:19
Well written.  I believe it is too early for a 2mb fork.  But I hope all miners hold to their word and implement the 2mb fork as they said they would because that is the honorable thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:34:55


aka not burning it ;)
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:24:45
I wish the btc1 dev group was good.  Sadly from what I can see they aren't nearly as good as core dev group.
I wish that btc1 competing with core was healthy competition for a decentralized system.  Sadly btc1 is associated with just a few centralized miners who control most of the hash in bitcoin.
Reality is, the 2mb blocks won't take much to implement.  When core creates upgrades those upgrades can be copy and pasted into btc1 and released there.  The core team won't be dissolved nor will they become irrelevant.  I don't mind if an implementation aside from core takes the majority of hash power, I feel bitcoin is made to work this way.  I am sad that bitcoin hash power is dominated by a few miners but we have known that for a while and its the reason why I diversified into alts which seems to have made me some money so I'll keep it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:46:24
NYA is nothing.
I consider this a stalling tactic until we have some actual code that is being signaled.
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:07:15
Could someone link or describe a break down of the current non-currency uses?  I didnt realize we were already using it for things other than transactions although I have read many ideas.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:34:26
You cant simply decide which chain to transact on.  That is the dangerous thing about a transaction, it propagates to all networks.
You have to send out a transaction to yourself that you know will be invalid on one chain and valid on the other.  That way you've separated your coins to two separate addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:10:01
AOL is a client to access the internet.
So you probably should have said that 'Electrum is like AOL' and coinbase is like google or something.  None of it really made sense anyways but it was definitely oozing with feel good nonsense for the no-nothings.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:48:57
BitShares has pegged sub-token bitGOLD and bitUSD to their respective prices highly successfully without centralization. They do this by a sort of game theory using their BTS coins, pairing longers with shorters to force the bitGOLD and bitUSD prices to where they belong.  Search google for more info on this.  It is pretty impressive I wish I learned about it before BTS became just another overbought shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:08:40
It isn't insane that the miners would fight segwit.  It makes perfect sense.
Reality is, the original idea that miners would have an incentive to do what is best for the bitcoin users was idealistic and incorrect.
Since then we have learned about ASICBOOST exploit, transaction malleability failure, and ASIC mining.  Since then we have had a thousands of new cryptocurrency alternatives.  Since then we have added the ability to SHORT bitcoin on leverage and LONG its competitor coins on leverage.
Jihad and other miners have every incentive to delay fixes for asicboost and transaction maleability.
And when they want to... LONG bitcoin alternatives, SHORT bitcoin, and destroy bitcoin to the best of their ability.  When bitcoin is no longer profitable to mine, they can just redirect their mining equipment to a different coin that works on same algo.  Even if they take a loss on mining equipment, they can profit on the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-25 05:51:50
It can be done with a trustless third party.  Take a look at how BitShares (BTS) modulates bitGOLD and bitUSD to keep them at their pegged prices via game theory.

I support UASF (BIP 148).
Since miners have promised to do segwit asap and 2mb hardfork in 6 months, I hope they keep to their word and do both these things and do so with compatibility with my UASF node.  They will earn more respect from me from keeping their word and following through with segwit2x than they would for doing what I want them to do (UASF and no 2 mb fork until recommended by core devs).
I will likely support the 2mb fork because I do not see an advantage to supporting a legacy fork.  Assuming the code is peer reviewed.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:07:19
I really do not think bitcoin can create the peg.  Its a major part of the BTS protocol sadly.
I wouldn't support a BTC fork for much.  But there could be an unpegged sidechain that regulates the pegged sidechain.

is for a minority of the community (note way less users) that want big blocks NOW and support BitMain, Roger Ver, and other big blockers who want centralized miners to decide how big the block should be.
supports the bitcoin core developers, mostly.  They want big blocks but not until needed.  They support SegWit.  People who shill for bitmain alt coins and big blocks and talk conspiracy get banned.

GOOG will eventually become more like MSFT- shares will be more stable and increase in price less, but the company will be making a net profit which will be disbursed to shareholders via dividends.  Likewise, property owners in most of the east coast of the US are seeing their property value remain stable or decline, but they can still profit by renting their property out or utilizing it for business, such as farmland.
But yes, tech stocks and up-in-coming west coast properties are typically bought to be sold at a later time.
I found more entertaining that most of the post could be talking about fiat cash!
