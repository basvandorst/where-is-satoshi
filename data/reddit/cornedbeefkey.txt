Not if you're in the UK they don't. Therefore we can hypothesise that in the English language as it evolves, there is no right or wrong way to do it. Going forward I'll charge £25 to pick up this guy's errors and correct them.

It pumped from 6k to 9k for no reason, only thing I can think is a whale wants to make some money pumping it, then there was that 25k coins thing yesterday...
So whale pumps price, volume spikes and is held high, everyone goes bananas, all the moon kids come out of the woodwork throwing stupid numbers around like "$100,000 by the end of the week" mainstream media picks it up, big investors with deep pockets come along and buy into it. Whale dumps all their coins and volume dries up. Whale buys all their coins back on the way back down. We'll fall back into the $6ks soon. That's my view anyway. Sold all mine for 8k on the way up just before it jumped and hit 9k and was kicking myself for it at the time, not feeling too bad now though, so will be back in when it bottoms out again.

Yeah but it's not 10 years ago now is it? 2 years ago it was almost 3x what it is today. That statement is meaningless. 
It went to 9k over the last couple of weeks **for no reason** those who pumped it and propped up the volume have all disappeared now probably shopping for lambos while everyone who's still holding runs around trying to stamp out fires.

Based on what? There's fuck all volume, price is going down, there's no reason for bitcoin to be going up besides hype.
Fear is the order of the day

To buy more of it back cheaper. Didn't work this time though. Guess I'll just sit this one out.

Literally sold all my bitcoin at 8100 a few hours ago hoping for a random crash, so you can thank me for this spike.
I'll let you know when I buy back in so you can sell before it crashes. FML. :/

I've done pretty well calling peaks and buying back in quite a few times, obviously not a sensible trading strategy, it's basically gambling. Was always going to end up getting caught out at one end of the wave

I made the biggest mistake of my life when I sold all my eth (200ish) at £20 just before it went mental a couple of years ago. This is nothing compared to that ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

1.8 actually, not a lot but enough to be pissed off about. Still got my eth so it's not the end of the world.
