Yes, go back 3 posts to your first reply and see how you spelled it whilst correcting me. You forgot the second 't', and thus mispelled it while at the same time chiding me for the same thing.

You were saying?

Coinbase fees with a card are pretty rough, but they don't see all that unreasonable if you use ACH. Are other places really that much cheaper? I think I pad a like $4 on a $200 transaction last time, which obviously isnt ideal, but doesn't seem too horrible. 
To be fair though, I was in to metals before bitcoin, so maybe I'm just more used to stupidly high fees and premiums from that.
Have heard good things about Gemini, but regrettably they don't serve my region so don't have any first hand info.

+1 to this question, especially the linux part. I'm planning to dig out a spare raspberry pi I've had laying around and turn it into my own little diy hardware wallet (yes, I know the actual products are better), but I don't know nearly as much about linux security as I do windows.
My plan is to set up the pi. Change root info. Clone the sd card so I have a fresh install backup. Download a wallet. Transfer a small amount into wallet. Create multiple encrypted back ups. Load up a copy of the fresh install with no wallet and make sure I can recover from the back ups I created on the fresh system. Then finally transfer more funds.
I plan to use it mostly as cold storage. I thought about using an old cell, but the fact that the pi has no built in wifi, I have multiple pis, and it can accept sd cards and usb made the pi seem more appealing. 
With it being mostly offline I assume security isn't as big a concern, but would definitely appreciate any suggestions.

So I was simply uninformed, yet you were careless and overconfident. Not to mention petty as you resorted you possibly the lowest form of internet argument (spelling/grammar) next to calling someone Hitler. Congrats.
You also didn't realize your mistake until after I spelled it out in 3 different posts, so I could also criticize your lack of self awareness. We can play this game of tit for tat all day if you want, I'm currently getting paid to reddit.

Umm, reread your post... you spelled it incorrectly while correcting me. I was quoting your post.

As annoying as it is, imo this is simply part of being an early adopter in an emerging technology. When you get the first laptop off the line, or buy a game on day 1, you can't really be shocked when there are a few kinks they didnt work out. I don't think the complaints are invalid, and we should definitely expect it to get better, but with how public facing coinbase is for the bitcoin community, I do kind of worry that all the negativity on here directed towards them is a bad look for bitcoin as a whole.
Just think about how many salty assholes out there are looking for a reason to shit on bitcoin. I've been part of the precious metals community for awhile, and it blows my mind how many of those people seem tk have dug their heels in and refuse to accept bitcoin as a legitimate store of wealth. When even staunch supporters of bitcoin start shitting on the services that are integral to the bitcoin system, we're basically forming a narrative against bitcoin for them that they can then go preach to whoever will listen.
I'm not saying don't complain, or not to expect better from coinbase, but do we really need a new post every 15 minutes on this sub with someone complaining? I've made a handful of purchases from coinbase over the past few weeks, and aside from last night I didn't have any problems. Even last night I just had to wait a few minutes and reload the page.
It would be nice if everything worked perfectly, but with the increase in bitcoin awareness, it doesn't seem completely unreasonable that the service most friendly to first time buyers is experiencing some issues. As annoying as it might be, I think we'd all benefit from a little patience, and maybe pump the breaks on completely shitting on services that support bitcoin over a little inconvenience.
That being said, I might feel differently if I had a significant amount of money in coinbase, or was looking to make a big purchase and couldn't. As a modest hodler though, it just seems like a lot of outrage over a fairly minor inconvenience.

If your strapped for cash and have a printer, paper wallets are cheap and easy. There are a bunch of youtube videos that'll walk you through the process of doing it securely.

I think coin market cap uses an average of multiple exchanges, where as these posts usually get made after a specific exchange reaches whatever particular threshold we're celebrating. I dont think there is really an official exchange they use for these, but I personally use GDAX as my go-to exchange for watching the price. Seems like it is usually pretty close to the average.
