Still lower than PayPal, whose normal payments are over $0.30 each.. $0.35 plus a percentage, I think.  Though PayPal has a micropayment method as well now (albeit a bit of a hassle to set up) and I can't remember what the fees are like on that.

Many things.  The most significant, in my opinion, is that they built their little empire by ripping off games from other developers.. over and over again.

Here's an article from 2009, right around the time FarmVille was released:


 
Though Zynga usually rips off smaller developers without the means to compete, even EA has sued Zynga for ripping off The Sims with their own "The Ville":

They deleted inactive accounts?  How inactive are we talking?  I have one from 2000 but haven't logged into it in three years or so... Hope it's still there...

I agree.  It'd also be great for PSN users who want to purchase digital imports, as buying PSN credit for other regions is currently a pain and often involves significant markup from resellers.
