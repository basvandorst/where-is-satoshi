My point is, it shouldn't be a problem period...is this actually news to some people? Electoral College has been a thing for quite some time now, and for good reason
When you have a presidential candidate who doesn't even bother to campaign in certain states and bitch about losing those said states after the election, you don't have much room to argue.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:31:51
And when it comes out in about a week and shows no collusion, what then? Will this stop? or just go on to something else?
Nancy Pelosi was asked that and said, "I’ll be satisfied when we have a new president of the United States who is a Democrat.” Is that how things work? Sounds like a threat to democracy.
Another favorite quote of mine is , "Donald Trump refused to say that he’d respect the results of this election. That’s a direct threat to our democracy." Oddly enough, we've seen the complete opposite since 2016 from the left. I can't wait till the Mueller report is released, the goal posts haven't been moved back enough lately.

@_date: 2019-04-11 19:27:42
So Mueller is saying there was no collusion, Barr is saying there was no collusion...also Barr has said he would release a redacted version of the report...color coded might I add, which will indicate what reason it was redacted and we'll be getting it soon within the next week apparently. 
My question to you is, at what point will this stop? When will the left be satisfied? When the report comes out showing no collusion will there just be more aggressive demands to show the full un-redacted report? Because Nanci Pelosi was asked this question and her response was, "I’ll be satisfied when we have a new president of the United States who is a Democrat.”

@_date: 2019-04-11 18:02:14
Now we know the truth is there was no Russia collusion with Trump, but what we do know is that there was a spying attempt on Trump and his staff by Obama and his staffers. Also, all the bullshit Hillary pulled during the election.
@_date: 2019-04-18 22:29:19
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:23:04
It's real in the sense it exists, the dossier was made up bullshit in effort to get a team to spy on the Trump campaign. Assange has given damaging evidence for years now, you bitch about cherry picking yet you're only butthurt because Trump won. Stop acting like it wasn't going to happen anyway. Hillary was an extremely flawed candidate, the people knew that and 2016 elections were polarized to a point where people who were going to vote for Trump, were going to vote for him and there wasn't anything you could do to stop that.


And if you want to keep beating a dead horse and keep losing time after time, please do so. I won't think about you at all. It really worked for the past 2 years and no matter what gets released your cognitive dissonance will continue to make your party lose and you will continue to lose in 2020 and past that.

I’m confused when popular vote mattered during a presidential election? We have the electoral college because the cities with huge populations like Los Angeles shouldn’t be able to single handedly control who the president of our country is. The electoral college is only an issue when we don’t have a democratic president. Wasn’t a big deal when Obama was in office and won’t be a big deal whenever there is another Democrat in office. 
I agree with that, investigations are good and I welcome future investigations as well, actually some investigations that could happen very soon. At least we’re on the same page. Just make sure to accept the results when they come out.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:12:23

Yeah, not what I said but more like "destroyed by people you let in", yeah...that's more like it. You're letting in migrants who love to rape your nation. That's all.


Like I said I have less than a .0001% chance of getting shot, what does me having a gun have to do with being safer? I'm already safe, now what I'm asking you is what is your problem with our 2A? Obviously legally obtained issues are not the issue and when you rule out suicides, accidents, justified shootings, gang violence..WITH a legally obtained firearm...we statistically do not have a gun issue. It's right there, we both looked at the stats...so what is your problem with America owning firearms and the 2A?

[Except deaths by gun violence barely puts a blip on the radar compared to other illnesses]( even more so when you break it down like I have a few times already involving suicides, gang violence, self defense etc... It's less than .001% chance the average american will get shot and killed. That's a fact, that's a stat and you can't argue it.
[But it's increasing...why?](


Because we're talking about ill intent when using a firearm. Not to mention we're talking about 3% of gun related deaths are accidents. Less than 1,000 people a year.
Leftists are so obsessed with guns, even more than Republicans. The fact is we have the 2A, it's glorious. And when the stats are broken down, it's undeniable that guns are not an issue in the US. More than other countries? Sure I never denied that. But it's still a non-issue.
I'll leave you with this, don't let cognitive dissonance blind you with ignorance. Have fun in Sweden, don't go getting raped on me now...buh bye
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:07:50
Horde referring to illegal immigrants, or the caravan of illegal immigrants coming to the US border demanding to be let in. Once again, immigrants can be from anywhere, of any skin color, but that's besides the fact since it's referring to **illegal** immigrants, which is against US law to jump the fence into our country. I've never once seen someone on T_D being against **legal** immigration.
Explain why that is racist...I'll wait. Or try again with something else.

Your replies are full of speculation and anecdotal garbage that somehow form a sentence...not to mention your obsession with “horde”. It’s like you randomly clicked on a link on T_D and went with it.

Sorry to keep you waiting, important business. My president was talking...
Dude, you live in the rape capital of the EU, let's not joke about that. Molmo is riddled with gang/gun violence as well as migrant crimes, especially rape. [Wasn't there just two explosions down there? ]( Look at the statistics for the year....
I didn't swallow any bullshit, it's the reason your country doesn't record ethnicity for rape crimes, even your[precious BBC says so](
Also, my health care kicks ass. I don't pay very much, in fact I and most people I know don't even think about it. When I'm sick or injured for the most minor thing I walk in and get taken care of instantly. Not sure wtf you are talking about.


Compared to your no-go zones where cops literally do not even go at all? I live outside Chicago, I know all about it. Illegally obtained weapons used...the issue isn't legal firearms. Hell I own a gun and it's been sitting in my closet collecting dust...hasn't killed anyone.
But shit...you got me there. I mean there is roughly 32k deaths a year from gun violence, it's declining though.
( **HERE COMES THE GOOD PART...**)
...well, 60% are suicides, which accounts for 19,200 of those
...well, ok 3% are accidental shootings so there's another 920
...ok, 4% are justified like in self defense so knock another 1,280 off
...33% are homicides so that's 10,560 deaths...still a lot and you got me there, so checkmate...you win.
...BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! 80% of those homicides are gang related where 85% of the time it's with an illegally obtained firearm so that's another 8,448 taken off.
...I guess that leaves 1,712 in a society of 312 Million people.
You made fun of my math before, so bare with me please. That's about 1,712 killings a year by firearm.
**SO** I guess you're right. I have a .000102% chance of getting killed by a firearm in the states.
Well...I mean...I don't live in the ghetto like Molmo, don't plan on committing suicide and not planning on committing a violent crime with a firearm...[so it's more like .00000856% chance](
...you were right, America has a gun problem lol. Man, I love CDC statistics.


It's the greatest country on Earth...idk what you mean.

So...that's your argument? A caravan of thousands of South Americans who illegally crossed into Mexico (where they were offered assistance and denied it), continued North with the intentions of illegally crossing into the US, said thousands of times their intentions were to cross illegally into the US, then got to the border and threw rocks at border patrol and tried to illegally cross into the US, some did cross into the US...so your statement of "If they haven't crossed the border yet, how are they illegal?" is just 100% wrong anyway but figured I'd break down this great timeline for you...
Also, please get back to where you saw racism on The_Donald...I'll wait again

T_D is really good about banning people for that as well. There was a post a while back of a collection of false flag accounts that were purposely making racist comments...funny enough all 1-3 day old accounts too. They want us to be like that so bad...but we're not, cognitive dissonance is huge with that group.
 The biggest one I see is "Oh you're racist because you hate immigrants." First off, we hate illegal immigration, big difference. Second, Immigrants can be white, black, brown, yellow...whatever Third, Trump supports can be white, black, brown, yellow...whatever.
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:01:06


What do you mean by threats? Enlighten me. Because I have less than a .0001% chance of getting shot, statistically. So you must mean something else.


That's why everyone wants to immigrate to Sweden and not the US...lolwut. It's ok, I'm sure we'll help you out when your country gets taken over by migrants. Job growth, stock market, good food, freedom, 1 more flag on the moon than you, and not getting flooded by illegal aliens...k

Thanks for the link proving my point that we need a wall, better border patrol spending and that we're working on Making America Great Again.
Reality check? Link blindly just searching "orange man bad, how to drumpf-a-trump supporter" then sending me a BBC link?
You should look into the visa issue, the only thing you got correct was the 700k number. It is that, however at any given time thousands are being deported while thousands more are coming in, over staying their visas, then leaving...rinse, wash, repeat. It's a cycle and the number stays the same. It's not 700k staying all year and increasing. They're working on that, there is a system and it's being taken care of like always. 
Also, a lot are students that overstay because of mixing up school years, with visa years they are able to stay. Many are backpackers that overstay for 2 months visiting friends. Some are tourists where their visas expire but their families do not, etc...it's pretty easy to look up all this info. This is all automated and easier to account for everyone with a visa than just some fence jumper crossing into the country.
Thousands go back today but thousands more will go back the next day. A thousand more will be on their return planes next month, a thousand more came today.
Did you even know Canadians coming into the US on a temp basis for 12 hours to a day are considered illegal and put on a list for overstaying visas even if it's late by an hour? I'm sure you did...
People like you use these stats as a way to legitimize the need for a wall or increased border security. But I'm ok with your ignorance, I get to call you out on it. 
 
Immigrants overstaying their visas are not the same as illegals flooding the border demanding to be let in, demanding for immediate citizenship.
Basically, you're fucking stupid for trying to use foreigners with visas as an example to help push a claim. Cool BBC article though.
Most importantly...can you provide an example of someone being racist on The_Donald? Still waiting and feel like it's weird I've had to ask so many times, you seemed so confident.

Because if it's annually, you are so far off from the actual number I may actually think you are mentally retarded despite the previous hyperbole. 10k a month would be a very conservative number. Last [September there were almost 17k recorded people trying to enter alone]( wtf are you talking about?


I obviously don't, you're 100% wrong. I don't think it's racist, you do. Why? You're the same fucking idiot to say Trump is racist for the Muslim travel ban a while back.


Yeah, actually I do. If you are actually escaping a country so bad you refuse asylum somewhere, you are throwing away good food on the street given to you for free, complaining about getting free food from Mexico...then yeah...I think that "erases their right".


That's cool, I totally support them wanting that. They can immigrate here legally. Why is that so bad?
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:48:56
Your baiting article from the guardian also mentioned homicides are only a small proportion. And when you look into that it’s less than 1% of gun related deaths are homicides by shitty people, in shitty areas, gang related and hey...guess what, illegally obtained weapons. 
Try again asshole. More people die of obesity, cancer, car accidents, alcohol, cigarettes etc...literally almost anything  than guns cause.

Make up bullshit, like "horde" is a racist term? Nah, I'm good. Stop being such a dumb fuck and actually back your shit up and find anything racist at all on The_Donald, you can't. 


They were offered asylum in Mexico, holy shit you are fucking misinformed and just idiotic at this point. They were offered asylum in Mexico, refused and continued to go through Mexico to the US border. SO no...the caravan can go fuck themselves.
