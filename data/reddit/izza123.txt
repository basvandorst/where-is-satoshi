There once was a large bitcoin theft.
They said only 60% of cash left!
They said "IOU, here these tokens will do" 
And now you are poor and bereft.

He is terrified and offended by anything unregulated.

That painting is also shit.
@_date: 2014-07-05 00:40:54
so like... 10 cents?
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:23:34
its now on the block, half hour later 1 confirm. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:37:09
That's fucking awful guy. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:05:06
You can't argue with facts because you are a moron so you resort to ad hom attacks. What a joke.

I think even going to a witch doctor to have a chicken sacrificed over the computer might be worthwhile

This is what autism looks like

Forcefully pushing development through malicious means would be an attack, if that were the case. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:07:00
What makes you think they will decrease again? You don't think people will continue to compete based on the new standard? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:28:17
Lets say the attacks magically stopped now, everybody would still be paying the inflated fees, in order to still be confirmed more and more transactions will pay the inflated fee, Who is going to be the first one to risk their coin? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:37:55
Increasing tx fees to the point of unviablility is permenent damage. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:48:41
Yeah ended up going through in 3~ blocks, I was just taken aback by the medium priority. After all a 72 bitcoin tx would even be high with that fee. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:07:55
Really? I was unaware of that. Is it that older coins have lower or higher priority? 
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:22:26
Comparing it to north Korea doesn't actually make your point stronger. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:07:16
You guys have crafted your TOS in such a way that is anybody wins a significant sum of money you can deny their win. You already have a shitty reputation and things like this just make it worse. There is no reason to use bitstarz. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:02:22
Remove the address from his deposit page? 
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:08:03
Your fee is fine, the network is apparently running at capacity and it's taking forever for confirmations

Sell on LBC for cash deposit 
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:04:14
Businesses like this hide all kinda of strange requirements hidden in their TOS to avoid paying out 
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:01:38
Clever how you didn't bother with any of that until you owed him 3000$, the deposits and withdrawals were not a concern the win was. I assume you weed out a lot of winners by selectively enacting your policy of theft.

God the government sucks at tumbling here is another 3244 BTC

You literally will wait 10 months for a movable amount of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:16:01
Great the network will be unusable with dust transactions. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:26:02
1000 BTC wouldn't cause any damage whatsoever, even if sold all at once the price would rise like 10$
@_date: 2015-10-10 10:44:33
Im not sure if you are aware but a 7th is bigger than an 8th. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 11:27:22
Why say something if you dont actually know? The 51% attack would take place if a pool reached 51% of the hashrate and doublespends, the attack has nothing to do with block reward it has to do with double spending. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:39:25
Them owning hardware has nothing to do with it. Let's say you have a bank of 10 miners mining 1 BTC daily, you wouldn't those miners for less than 1 BTC daily or you'd be losing money. The people who rent those miners can make some money speculating on the currency but it would be more efficient to just buy the BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:07:12
Still pointless, no reason for them to sell hash power at a loss. They are already mining on those machines, the only reason to let you rent those miners is because you'll pay more than they produce.

upvoted but i doubt the feasibility or reasoning behind this product. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:24:00
I will resolve it in the sense that i will be honest and tell you that that money is gone.
