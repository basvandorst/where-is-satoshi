You seem to be unfamiliar with the way the US government operates
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:07:05
You can't make it, it's naturally produced by humans and some rare plants

Were you the guy that was trying not to smile the whole time behind the one speaker
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:26:51
For what you want, just go with coinbase. It's easier
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:51:05
The warning they showed you did say you were free to cancel any time before it processed. Stop being a dick

I can't decide if this Shasky lady is helping or hurting
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:24:06
I don't know, all she's saying is if people do illegal stuff we're going to stop them.

He couldn't take bitcoins from you anyway

I'm not downvoting...there are a lot of scams that I report right away, but since you are answering questions I think you deserve the opportunity to prove trustworthiness.

I'm fairly new too, but it seems like the main reason is the relative liquidity in the markets. Mt. Gox is supposed to be really hard to get your money out of or trade quickly on. 
Also, the exchanges are based in different countries and the relative demand in those countries varies.

It's worse when they drop the price by $1 or more by selling .00023141 every time it goes up
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:37:50
The food has trouble adjusting and gets bullied at school
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:25:52
Yes...i got like .00012 yesterday. 6 cents when i got it, 8 now...
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:45:58
this is only the first panel...they have other people coming after
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:02:47
There have been a couple other posts about this that have been phishing scams...you sure it was really Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:43:28
Upvote this and see if we can get his attention. We need every foothold in the US

FTFY

Moon good
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:30:23
Can you elaborate on this? Are there rumors of any exchanges starting up that would let the Indian market in? I think a lot of people would appreciate it if someone local posted a thread with insights and links to keep us updated here in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:18:00
I wish i could downvote on forbes.com
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:47:17
I was so sure I was going to see that damn bubble chart again
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:41:10
If JP Morgan or a similar institution decided to, they could probably just buy out the best exchange that develops from the US startups.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:37:19
I am fairly new to BTC, so I wasn't around when BTCinstant was operating. A couple questions:
Where are you based?
What type of investors do you have at this point?
What is the scale of your operation?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:33:25
This is inevitable...everyone is going to write about it and few of them will have any clue what they're talking about. People will read this crap and believe it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:14:41
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:49:35
Yes, but coinbase isn't a live exchange
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:32:10
did you even read the comment? wouldn't you be pissed if they charged your bank account then didn't give you coins and wouldn't respond to you? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:16:53
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:24:04
You have 1 BTC worth $1000
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:08:55
This is true - service fees are 5-10x higher (depending on the merchant, small stores pay more than big chains) with credit cards
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:23:44
this is just a loop of the same few seconds, and there is nothing on the US side...over a longer time period (like a day) this would be really cool
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:46:44
I hardly noticed that $400 drop
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:19:55
The faster the method of getting coins, the more expensive/less secure it is. If you have a US bank account you can buy at coinbase, get your price locked in, and get your coins in about a week. Pretty reliable as far as anyone can tell, and they're based in San Francisco instead of halfway around the world which is somewhat comforting. Trading at gox or btcchina requires a Japanese/Chinese bank account if you ever want to be able to withdraw fiat. If you are in the EU you have some other options as well like SEPA transfers.

If you have to ask the internet, maybe you should have thought about it longer. But I think it was smart.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:24:45
If that was true, why wouldn't the message say "...you will receive the market price when supply is available" 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:27:15
How are we supposed to trust this...who are you and what are you backed by? Do you have testimonials for your service?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:18:30
I just bought .1 for like $35 last weekend...still waiting for it to clear
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:26:57
It depends where you're from. If you're from the US then Coinbase is probably the easiest.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:04:52
What is the current sentiment in India? Are people starting to pay attention? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:59:44
Supposed to be available tomorrow. I'm not sure exactly when
EDIT: They took the money out of my bank account last Tuesday, so it's about time they clear it
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:31:23
I don't think the exchanges will care, it will only depend on your bank account really.
