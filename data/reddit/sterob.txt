Superman being not real doesn't change the fact that the moment he goes public, the lifes of everyone related to him will be destroyed, by frenzy paparazzi or criminals. 
There are plenty of cases where a poor chaps won lottery, get his face on the big newspaper then long-lost relatives appear out of nowhere begging for money. Shit spiral into a storm because "he is millionaires yet he only donate $100 to the church" situation.

I will do a rough script translation 
- Despite the warning of the centre bank, the first bitcoin exchange in vietnam is still launched recently. 
- As money, bitcoin is no longer an option for banks in vietnam, but is it treated as good or toy (yes the anchor specifically said the word "toy" as the thing for children to play) and is using bitcoin legal in Vietnam? Those questions remain unanswered. 
- The first bitcoin exchange in Vietnam, with just a click you can register an account here. Despite being advertised as an online exchange, the company told us that to operate the have to register as another form of business 
- (The female representatives from the exchange):  Bitcoin is not yet defined in any legal documents so we have to register our license using terms that are most close and appropriate to our business nature. For example bitcoin is related to IT while online exchange is related to online auction, retailing
- In the news of the first bitcoin exchange launch, the vietnam centre bank re-announces in their website that bitcoin is not money and they do not accept them as money for any transactions. 
- (guy from centre bank of vietnam): - As many countries in the world, Vietnam centre bank does not view bitcoin as money or legal payment method. So bitcoin transactions and bitcoin holder are not protected by the law. Credit institutions in Vietnam are also forbidden to do transaction related to bitcoin or any other virtual currencies.
- So, as money bitcoin is no longer an option for the payment system of banks and credit institutions in vietnam. In additional, bitcoin is not yet legally ruled as good or service. Bitcoin is not included inside the digital commercial act, so the e-commerce department of the ministry of industry and trade have rejected the application of website vbtc.com (the exchange site)
- According to Lawyer Truong Thanh Duc, the problem lies in there is no clearly legal documents about bitcoin and using bitcoin in vietnam.
- Lawyer: If you sell goods or provide services then you have to register your business, do paperwork and pay taxes, you have to defines what is your business. So about bitcoin, no one knows what it is, there is no regulatory body to regulate. 
- Information about mt.gox 
- However there is many countries like US, Singapore, Japan that recognize bitcoin. Bitcoin is still a controversy. And in Vietnam the exchange has been operating for more than 1/2 months, thousands of transactions were done, and yet there is still no govt agency announcement about legality of bitcoin.  
- Bitcoin in Vietnam is operating outside the law and there are always hidden risks.

First of all most bitcoin supporters like myself do not condone illegal activities. 
The term "launder" was imahotdog own version of "no one can put poke my privacy and know all of my money". 
Do not want people to know what you do with your money =/= laundering. 
Do not want people to know what you do in your free time =/= doing illegal activities. 
And do not use the pathetic excuse " "If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear" that NSA used. 
Since imahotdog twisted the words i simply correct him. You are free doing do whatever you want with YOUR money as long as it is YOURS. And clearly in this case those money is not MK money. 
"Last time i heard that anonymous isnt bad and the internet should be free. So now some hackers took down PSN/Blizzard/LOL network, police cant find out who. You deserve it because you support anonymity "  - imahotdog in \r\internet

Also, you too can lose ALL of your money deposited into the bank and dont get it back. 
In my country, recently there was a case about a bank teller who did a "middle man attack". She receive the deposit money but did not deposit them into the bank vault, then she create fake papers  and took about 200 million USD, and she was working with  corporate, not the kind that can be easily tricked. In the end, 200 million vanished, the bank she worked for refuse any responsibility. And the poor corporates have to go on a wild goose chase.

the thread is kind of fuzzy so correct me if i am wrong. So what you did is download the log (leak) file of mtgox operation, then use the date of of the when that 113Mm.. address receive 300 btc (2013-04-16 17:17:05) to check whether if it match with a deposit on mtgox side. 
Then you found that there was a deposit recorded on mtgox side with the same amount and roughly the same time. So you conclude that is a mtgox address.   
p/s: your method is kind of guessing base on evidence and may be wrong if there was someone who deposit 300btc to mtgox at the exact same time?

It is a "you have chance to not get paid and will never lose" bet if he is strongly confidence in his point, which is not pointless. 
However if he actually think there is a chance bitcoin will raise, then it become like you described, a "you have chance to not get paid and may lose" bet.
Also your point about "don't get paid" is moot if they use lawyers. 
The notion of making a bet to demonstrate your conviction is because anyone can lie. So only through binding contact that they will be penalised if their statements are proven false, people will show their true color. In a formal context there is perjury, in less formal context there is betting money, to ensure that people tell no fabricated words.

It is more like a challenge that does the author stand confidence with his words or he didn't lie. If he does he will be penalised (lose the bet). A similar example is [Prince Andrew's accuser challenges him to swear he's innocent on oath]( 
where the prince is not forced to swear but it will be extremely fishy. The author can not take the bet but it will raise suspicious that even the author is not sure about his words.

There are actually a lot of bot watching satoshi wallet. At the first moment he move his coin to any other wallet. BTC price will crash to under 0.01 before he even has chance to sell his btc. So basically i dont have to trush satoshi.  However bank can rip me off and go scot free with their lawyers. In my country people deposit money to the bank and when the bank has to many bad dept, they decided to scam those money by using an employee as scapegoat, saying people gave the money to that particular employee and she turned rogue so the bank have no liability to those money.
When pool operator attack btc businesses they hurt the btc value which directly reduce their own riches. 
You can always back up your phone hot wallet. and if they beat you with a rubber hose then they could steal your bank account, gold, anything not just btc.

You deposit btc into mtgox wallet. The proof is in the block chain. You can trace where every your btc is going. And lastly, Mtgox is under criminal charge, Mark Kepl get death threat letter
However for the bank in my country, no one know where the money goes. No one get threatened, no one face the rap. The only one who go to jail is the scapegoat who obviously made a deal with the bank top dogs to take all the charges.  Btw, did i mention  how in my country, criminal with life imprisonment get out of the jail after 5 years?

"If you have food in your fridge, clothes on your back, a roof over your head and a place to sleep you are richer than 75% of the world.
If you have money in the bank, your wallet, and some spare change you are among the top 8% of the world’s wealthy."
I would say yes.

Correct me if iam wrong. Basically  A muplitple, plus, or minus a predetermined value equal B. B is called a hash and miner job is to find out A that makes B smallet than the target difficult. Am i correct? However you said that target difficult become lower as the time passes but didnt it increase from below 1 to nearly 1 billion few days ago?also why dont miner just pick a number tbat is lower than last block A so the new B will definitely lower than last block B and has a high chance to be lower than the target difficult?
