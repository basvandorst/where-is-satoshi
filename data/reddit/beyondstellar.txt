The high could be in for The day. It's still in a down trend folks so be careful if your trading

The way I read the question, OP wants 1000 dollars profit by end of year 2010. I see at least a doubling in btc so if he deposits 1000 bucks and gains 100% by EOY 18..... get where this is going.
Edit. You want.

Well if they can get away with stealing your btc then why can't you just give your btc away to your family..... that's the beauty of a decentralized currency. No one knows who owns it so just give your kids or who ever the address and key and thats it.
