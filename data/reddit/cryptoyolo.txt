To easily claim forks, is it good idea to keep btc in non segwit address? Coinomi doesnt support segwit addresses yet which is go to place to sweep btc and claim forks.

Hi, Just received my new ledger nano recently, how should I go about sweeping btc and btc gold from paper wallet to my ledger safely. Should I use electrum or coinomi or something else? Also I would like to sell my super btc and btc diamond in the near future so I will be holding on to my private key.

hi op,  
New to this and those graphs don't make much sense to me. I am about to make my tx from electrum. How much should I set the fees in satoshis so it gets cleared in &lt; 1 hour?

Just installed mycelium to sweep my paper wallet to my ledger and I can't find a way to type in my private key. Any alternatives? Or should I type in my notes app, then copy to clipboard and import in mycelium?

I am not surprised at all. This run was all due to McAfee made it as his shill coin of day. I would suggest stay away from it beacuse:   
It has no unique selling point.  
The top 100 wallets control 96% supply

I have a CB account(which means I have GDAX as well) but I have barely used CB before meaning I am not verified there or on GDAX. Can I still use GDAX for free transaction without being verified?

Buy bitcoin immediately to get your feet wet and because you will need bitcoin if you want to buy them and this dip won't last long. In the meantime start researching some altcoins

So a 24 word seed( can generate a deterministic list of BTC addresses. Let's say if private key of one of the addresses gets compromised, does that put other addresses at any sort of risk? What about ETH addresses generated from the same seed?
