sorry that i‘am asking again but i have one more question. It only exists on mainnet, is there a planed date where the final ‘release‘ is? or are the core devs just developing it at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:55:20
but segwit and LN are two different things, right ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:52:29
what is mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:49:54
in the unconfirmed transactions but not at transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:10:04
yes but for exsample bitcoin stared to be used mainly was beginning 2017. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:05:21
is the onion routing mainly used at the moment or is it just a idea at the moment ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:04:24
i don’t think so.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:20:31
it doesn‘t matter i just want to do that with my wallet id and privat keys
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:43
why nobody is talking about this.. it can just kill bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:04:13
ohhh meeen... i don‘t understanding what you write there... now i‘am scared. can someone explain me this in german or in simple english??
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:16:12
for example i mean when bitcoin gold forks bitcoin how can i see my bitcoin gold wallet and how much i have of them and just use them ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:58
thanks sir, that was what iam looking for
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:14:02
so ... you mean it won‘t stop and we will habe 100$ transaction fees in a few weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:47
i think it can be the end if we don‘t do anything... has the bitcoin core devs sayed anything about this problem?

yes but if you don‘t have this k‘s it hurts more than a bullet
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:11:31
but i don‘t thunk that this is good. i can‘t use this coin...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:26:04
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:10:07
what is mempool and why it is growing ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:40:49
the dip is already balanced now. maybe it will go a few days sideways position but i think we won’t see the 5k again now but maybe the 6k. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:30:01
i think it won‘t drop before we reach the 9k or 10k ��
