Hey Justin..... just wanted to follow-up with you on the support channel. Thanks! Q
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:09:50
Yeah still waiting on Justin’s response. He said it’d take awhile... I believe it. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:43:33
Havent heard back since the initial message from him but remaining positive is all I can do. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:18:03
Yeah justin replied almost immediately after this post but I haven’t heard in a week. I tried to reply a couple times for follow-up but Ill just wait awhile bc it looks like they are going thru transaction hell. They bit off more then they can chew with what 10-20 employees and all these issues. Im sure by later this year they will be able to handle these issues fast and furious.

Good news! Got a message from Justin... although it may take a bit... if you sent btc to bch they should have functionality to credit that soon on a priority value basis. It will take a bit but be patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:10:22
Yes he replied shortly after the post. I hope to hear from him soon! Positive thoughts. Have a happy new Years!

Thank you Justin for the reply. Hope to hear from you soon.

Thats pretty stupid to say bc when u have coinbase you arent given a key
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:13:51
Ouch.... actually Coinbase reached out to me already and are working on a solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:30:39
Justin pm’d on Coinbase fairly quickly and was looking to resolve the issue. I have good faith that this will all work out ... regardless of what happens its a good lesson to me and to other . When I send crypto on my desktop I can double check much better but when Im mobile all it is is a flick away to screw it all up. Bch and btc are right next to each other on the screen. Have a happy New Years!

Yes Justin said that if BTC is sent to bch it would still be credited as BTC and bch sent to btc it would credit to bch. However I was told it would take some time for him to sort it out. I was notified early morning yesterday .

Thanks Justin.
I sent .4 Btc to my bch account instead of my btc 
Case number :  3188788
Sent u a pm. Thank you!!
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:17:29
Justin from Coinbase got in touch from me here and its being worked on. They do respond well despite how exceptionally hectic theyve been lately.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:40:28
Thank u!
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:05:16
Thanks buddy. I know it requires a private key to unlock so its in the hands of coinbase. Was a easy error on ur mobile phone bc they just added the bch on there.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:01:51
Yeah I got a 2nd email from Justin said it would take awhile w priority to larger transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:45:39
How long u think this will take?
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:27:30
Nope not a word since late jan
