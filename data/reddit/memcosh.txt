Google Wallet and PayPal does NOT charge any fee if you use your bank account or balance.(just like Venmo) All 3 of them charge a fee when you use your credit card.

i personally never had any issues with coinbase but jumped the ship right after i opened my circle account. so many unsolved issues around and extremely bad customer service is a huge no no for me. this was my comment a while ago regarding coinbase;

Big players are moving in, they w ill make sure the price goes way down and they will keep it there. Unfortunately this is the only way bitcoin will be used by masses as a payment option. no price stabilization meand no mass users.

Do you have to go through verification when you pay with bitcoin?

Just to add I didn't use btc-e for over a year and won't unless I have to but gotta give the credit where it's due.

Somehow phone's keyboard added them. Anyways, back to the point; they DID reimburse everyone. Try googling it.

All those exchanges are having problems (hacked, robbed, failed etc.) over the years but the shadiest looking one is still up and running with no issues. My hat is off to you BTC-E; I am sorry for doubting you.

When did they clear "everyone's" balances?

I believe you are talking about the hack that happened in 7/2012. btc-e "reimbursed" everyone who was affected by it. my point still stands.
