It's done this a few times in the past--looks like all is well now.

This is not a UX layer.  Application developer will have to integrate the mechanisms first.

This and more is the truth.
Forbes sent me an email this year, lauding my expertise in the field I work in and inviting me to be a "Forbes Contributor."  The email included a PDF brochure of all the 'services' that were provided to contributors.  Concierge, things like that.
The hook is pretty easy to swallow, I sat there thinking "Well, I am pretty damn good at (blah blah things I do), I'll just give them a call."
Called in, immediately realized the number was piped right to an Indian call-center.  The man had no idea who I was, nor anything about what I did.  I could hear snippets of other call-center employees for the duration of the call.
He then jumped right into the benefits of becoming a Forbes contributor, and how it would be great for my organization.  I smelled something fishy, and sure enough; anyone can become a Forbes Contributor for about 10K a year in dues.
Forbes has very literally sold their brand to anyone willing to pay.  They make their contributor articles feel the same as the other Forbes articles, and the guidelines for submission are paper-thin.
I used to respect Forbes a bit more before they let anyone use their brand for whatever.

"... in the form of "blockchains," a type of electronic ledger."
Can't wait to get me some electronic blockchains.

Looks like a EVGA.

Is this running on the Bitcoin blockchain?  I could find no reference, although I've not dug into the code.

Do they publish their hashrate?  According to [my calculations]( they are pulling about 23PH, but I'm curious if anyone else has "real" numbers.
edit: at least they aren't SPV mining?
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:47:11
Eligius blocks, however, are at least never *empty*.  Antpool and F2Pool submit zero-transaction [blocks]( [daily](
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:03:23
Hilarious.  I didn't notice that either.
edit: I'll pass it on.

Number three will break your heart!

I'm under the impression that the protocol would need to be changed to accommodate a penalty.  I would suggest we "vote with our miners," but since BITMAIN owns the means of production (at least for Antpool) I'm not sure how much of a dent could be made in that pool.
People *should* move to a pool that plays fair--but many of us are motivated by the profit, not the concept.
Edit: grammar be hard.

You should check it out in incognito mode--you're likely in a "search bubble."

I built a little tool to track this a little more granularly: [

No doubt; but I feel it's important to note that these pools are actively harming the network in pursuit of a few extra coins.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:38:59
Agreed.  This year the IRS has [less resources and influence]( than ever.  I imagine this is going to be a back-burner project for a junior agent, if even that.

Perhaps my understanding is not as robust as it should be, but could a pool *not* submit an empty block by choice?  BitFury seems to run without empties.
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:19:13
I saw that!  I'm going to start compiling more information, as I would like to personally have a better understanding of the individual processes.

I'll start gathering percentages and getting those posted--I'm curious to look at the patterns averaged over time.  Thanks for the comment.

Also Expedia, right?

It was as I had left it, and the logs were clean.  I updated everything to be safe, and after the support team told me they did it purposely (which they later changed their mind about) I just deleted my account.  There are better ways to convert coins now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:20:58
So after telling me they did it on purpose, they decided they didn't:

Yeah, my blood pressure went up for sure.  I didn't have anything sitting in Coinbase, but I always fear that one breach could lead to the next.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:08:27
I received the same alert, and support was IMMEDIATELY back to me (after I put in a ticket asking about the same as you here) saying they had turned my two-factor off 'because I hadn't used it in a while.'  I think someone accidentally pushed the wrong button....
