Here is what i've noticed. At around 3:00 AM EST, when a mass majority of americans are sleeping and china is in the middle of its day the price drops. Morning comes in america and people see cheap bitcoins, and go buy in the morning, bouncing the price up a few hundred by 9 AM EST and stabilizing the price. In the case of today BTC hit $3000 just as the east coast was waking up for the work day which just happened to be the number people were looking to buy in at bouncing up the number by a nice percentage. As china goes to sleep, the price will stabilize through the day, while at the same time, getting more news about chinese exchanges shutting down. Which probably means, tonight when most americans are going to sleep and the chinese are trading, its going to drop significantly again.

I mean you may be right, but the way things are trending if they buy before they sleep and sell when they wake up they're in pretty good shape, then comes the panic sell, and since there was a psychological bounce at 3K there will probably be a psychological panic sell when (if) it drops to 3.1K. I could be totally wrong only time will tell.

Anyone else have any information on this? I actually have the same question. I would think the transaction would go to "Fail" status for insufficient funds like everything else normally would.
