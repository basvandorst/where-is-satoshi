There are different escrow approches. One is that both the seller and the buyer transfer the cost of the good to the contract. The buyer in addition adds let's say 25% more. If the good arrives the buyer has an incentive to tell the contract everything went just fine. Only then will the buyer get his 25% back and the remaining funds are released to the seller. The seller also has an incentive to really ship because otherwise his funds will be stuck in the contract. This is only one method of automated escrows, there are different ones. It's all about creating incentives for the parties to play fair. The incentive to play fair only has always to be higher then the incentive to screw the other party off. And thats a problem that can be automated.

Reading though reddit, this happens since the very beginning when the problem first started. SOME transactions work out, MOST dont. And, due to double-spend, trying to transfer could just vanish your BTC eg. you transfer, the coins never arrive at their destination address and also don't "return" to mtgox. 
So the interesting question is: did this situation, which we know and have seen for the last 2 weeks, improove anyhow? 
I tried it out: tried to transfer some test amount to my wallet. Result: the transfer was started at mtgox and after a page reload my btc was back again in my mtgox wallet. Looking at the blockchain for the transaction i found: NOTHING. 
to make it short: TRANSACTIONS ARE STILL BLOCKED (tested, if you dont belive me, just try it out). Whatever some see may be just some internal test transactions or the dust we've seen for the past 2 weeks. 
Nothing yet changed. No new accoucements yet. The situation remails as it was.

Well let's make this easy: nearly all currencies are based on us dollar as their lead currency, which means: if dollar crashs, everything crashes. once everything was based on gold, but this changed 1933 with the " Emergency Banking Act". Also we should remind ourselfs that only the federal reserve bank, a PRIVATE company, has the right to print new dollars. Lets put this all together and we get: a private company (fed. reserve) controlls all us dollar and thus all other currencies. But the question is: why do other currencies trust in the us dollar? it's simple: the fed reserve trades us dollar for gold (e.g. you as a nation give them your gold and get us dollar back. Now, instead of keeping this nasty and hard to store gold as value for your currency, you only have to keep some printed paper) and ASSURES every nation that wants to use us dollar as lead currency that the equal amount of gold is in their safe. The problem here is: atleast after Charles the Gaulle in 1966 tried to trade back their dollars into gold we know: the fed reserve dosn't even have a tip of that gold in their safes. Already in 1966 they were unable to pay out france in gold. And remember: we're talking about a time when some millions was much for a nation. The following years the amount of printed dollars grow EXPONENTIALLY. You can easily imagine that the gold found on earth didn't keep up with that... so what do we know: 
1. A private company. lead by a hand full of individuals, controlls all fiat money on earth
2. Already 50 years back the us dollar had no real value and was based only on the trust everybody has in it
3. Today one dollar is at max worth the value of the paper it's printed at, still: since everybody belives in it and is dependent on it, the systems grows
So - yes. I guess dollars in the bank or your wallet are "save" from being stolen by the guy next door, just that they are not worth anything. Also, when talking about stealing: the guys at the federal reserve do the same to you every day and there is no bank or safe on earth who could do anything about it. 
So, if you handle bitcoins with care, (cold storage and so forth. - i'm pretty sure many sec. technologies are upcomming on this matter) i would say its way safer then fiat money. However - as with everything - it's only worth as much as one is willing to pay for it. If people loose trust in BTC, you loose value. Belive me: fed reserve will do everything they can behind the szenes to compromise trust in btc. And since most people don't know anything about fiat money and its real, non existent value, and also dont know anything about the safety of btc's value, it'll all be a psycho game. Our only hope are commonly well educated people, so they can understand and learn they're tricked. Here, if you ask me, lies the answer to may things in todays society: cheap cable tv and fastfood, low education, dull makeing pharmacy and food and so on. It's not by accident, it's intended.

There are other ways to trace you then your IP (e.g. cookies or exploits installing tracking sw). And how secure you are behind your VPN highly depends on many factors like: where is the company that hosts your vpn located at? what are the regulations there? where are the vpn servers located at? again: what are the regulations there? what are they willing to do to protect you (1 single person)? 
But hell - what do you care about. Talking about buying something is not illegal (atleat not where i come from). It would only be another evidence in case they want to link an action back to you. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:00:14
Bitcoin is not anonymous - period. paypal is not anonymous either. so you got a direct connection to your person. 
You may use other technologies on top of BTC to hide some traces and make it extremly hard to trace you back from a given transaction, but it dosn't mean that you're COMPLEATLY safe. who tells you so simply dosn't know better. in fact, who still thinks a turing machine may every be secure dosn't know better. oh, and localcoin would only make the FBI just ask the person who sold the btc to you who you are. and belive me: faceing couple of years in jail like everyone will do their best to help the feds.

First fail: you just posted it on redit. And yes, sure they try to obfuscate your transaction, but as i said: it's not 100% secure. considering the amount of work it would need to trace such a obfuscation back compared to what you want to do however, i'm pretty sure nobody will every try to trace it back to you...

This would mean doing the SECs job (using howey test and other tools) in real time for everyshitcoin s.o. mentions out there. I agree: sometimes it's easy to define it (BTC is a easy one) but often enough it's a thin, blurry line that transforms a currency into a full blown asset.

Everything corrodes. The question is in what way. Ti will create a corrosive crust just like Ai that will prevent it from further corrosion. The oxide film of Ti is more effective then the one e.g. of stainless steel.
You are right about the burning properties however. Ti would catch fire at about 600 degree C, which is easily reached in a house fire.

You're missing my point. My argument was that it's part of the american culture to openly talk about money. And that is probably a big factor limiting adoption speed of crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-21 05:45:52
To be fair: this venmo thing is pretty american. Nobody I'm aware of is using it in Germany and I doubt people would since Germans are very descreete about money in general. Never understood why americans talk so freely about their income. I believe that + social media is what made venmo big in the US.
So the tech is just reflecting the current state of your culture. Before that doesn't change I have little hope that people will exchange an easy to use widespread tech against crypto.
We're still at the beginning of a long road. Tech is one thing. Real change starts in the minds, and that's the hard part.

It's perfect if you wrap it with plausible deniability and shamirs secret sharing. Thought you loose 'easy accessibility' but that's only an issue if you are not on a long term investment. For daily payments you would not carry around hunderttausends of dollars in cash with you either. So the only thing i can think about where you need quick access to large amounts is day trading, which you should not do anyways imho.
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:29:53
This does only address rule enforcement in the digital space, from a tech point of view. But if we want adoption we have to keep the real world in mind. No magic code will auto enforce rules there. You need rules for crypto in the real world for law enforcement to be able to protect the community (different word for society) from all that we don't want. E.g. human trafficing.
So indeed. We need rules for crypto. Just different one that we have now in the finance sector.
I'd even argue we WANT rules, because we want adoption.

And you sure want rules. Believe me. You'd be the first to cry for protection from the state if there would be no rules. You should read more. I'd suggest Hobbes. Because you obviously have no idea how the world works.
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:19:21
I agree. We can and should not reflect everything we do for other reasons - and there are many good reasons FOR anon crypto and decentralized finance in general - in the light of law enforcement. BUT I believe that we anyways have the obligation to think about what we do and what we demand. This topic demands "no rules", which is BS. It's not as simple as that. What the autor and other reditors perhaps mean is "we don't want the current rules" or "we don't want YOUR rules". But that's something compleatly different and no: I do not think that this is just a subtlety.
And no: I do not have any more specific points regarding human trafficing. But I believe the one I pointed out is fair enough to at least talk about the implications of completly anon finance. Maybe you are right and you still can chase people if you see large purchaces. Maybe they are smart enough to launder their money. So then you can't trace the money and they got plausible deniability. Perfect crime.
But even if that would work: our current law enforcement system is not prepared for that. So, here we are again: if we want that, and do not want to sacrafice our justice system for it then we need to have rules in place BEFORE we go all in. E.g. in many countries the state has to proof you broke law (innocence presumption). AFAIK this doesn't apply to the US, were you got that reversed. But in such countries where the state needs proof there is a problem with the suggestion you made about how to chase the money: it's not the accused who has to proof how he payed for that car or house but it's the state who has to proof that the money he payed the car with comes from illegal activities. So there we are once again: rules would need to be adapted for that. E.g. if the source was crypto, you'd have to proof how you got that crypto. At which point of course the issue starts all over again because 1. that's what we don't want for other reasons and 2. it's probably technicly not possible to proof where the money came from. 
Don't you see the issues there that should be discussed? 
And if you do: how do you name the result of such discussions? I name it "rules".

Not sure you got the right post you're replying to.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:25:11
Maybe I should elaborate. First I believe in the concept of a "state" and in the system called "democracy" where all power is held by the people who choose their leaders. I do not agree on the way this is currently implemented, but that's another subject. The job of the state is to serve and protect all people. Even if someone claims "I can take care of myself", I doubt that. Probably of us was ever in a situation were he really had to "take care of himself". Maybe some believe so. But at the same time they use many insituations of the state on a regular basis whether they know it or not. 
If someone really things he is able to "take care of himself" I'd suggest to watch a bit of mad max to understand what the world would probably turn into if everyone would have to look out for themself.
That said, for a state to function we got seperation of powers and in special we got a executive which is there to enforce commonly agreed on laws.
To keep them in check, they are not allowed to do this at will. They need to find proof so a judge may find someone guilty. 
In order to find proof you need evidence. Whether you like it or not: follow the money has been of one of the biggest and most important ways to find proof especially in highly organized crime. 
You might argue "one can not trace a dollar", but that's not true. Feds trace dollars all the time. Paper money, electronic transaction even possesions.
This example in special is not something about BTC. More around the sorts of Monero. If you give the people access to an absolutely untracable money system, you will also have criminals abuse it.
So, yes. We need to decide what we want more. Absolute anonymity or some degree of protection and law enforcement. Because you can't have both. So: that would be an example where I believe we'd need some rules. I'm not suggesting how they look like. Thats not my job. If we collectivly agree that e.g. the higher risk of organized crime is something we're willing to pay for anon finance, well, then it's that. STILL: that would be a rule, wouldn't it? The rule would be that "there's no rule and having anon transactions is fine". 
Also, maybe more relevant for BTC, I believe in tax paying. I'm not saying I like how it's spend and I certainly believe we need many changes in the system. But still: tax in general is something important. If you make a profit, you give some part of it to the state to function. We all benefit from it all the time, so yes, I think it's a fair deal. It's not like we're paying "them". We're paying "us". 
So, if you make profit using crypto, you should also pay tax for it. It's nothing different then making profit with gold or anything else really. So: another thing were we need rules. In special if we want adoption. Without equal rules for crypto as for traditional payment systems adoption would take decades, if i'd ever happen at all. That said: I'm not saying the current rules in finance are good and we should just "adopt" them. They suck. Hole Wallstr. knows it and they make a living by it. So, the rules should be adopted and changed. But still: we need SOME rules here.

Technology adoption happens by educating the nerds, the one who are able to understand and actually care. The rest of the people will simply follow them. They out source the decission making process to the ones they think understand it better. You are fooled if you think we should educate EVERYONE or if you believe this is possible in the world we currently live in.
It's always been like this. The only thing that changed is time. Adoption will now happen more quickly today then e.g. 20 years ago. That said: we're still in the early adopters phase. Time will show if the technology we bet on will survive or be replaced by an other model.
