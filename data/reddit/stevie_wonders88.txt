Which is why it is illegal in the stock market because it does not work and is not effective. ROFL. 
it is not effective which is why US regulators are trying to bring it to the end 
FACE fucking palm
Like I said you must know everything except for fucking reality. In reality the order was cancelled so it was a case of spoofing.
so right now you are in the stage of denial. Not suprised somebody who thinks he knows everything does not live in reality. 
Basically all the top comments called it a spoof even before the order was cancelled. But your fucking dumbass is arguing about it a day after the order was cancelled. This is like arguing Germans are winning a day after they surrender. 
Sorry but I have no respect for a retard who is arguing about something that has already been proven a day ago
Thanks for the laughs

Rofl hhahahaha.
Whatever you say buddy. You must be one of those people on the internet who knows everything. 
This is literally elementary stuff. 
One glance through the comments and you will see 25% of the comments mention this. Which is a fair ratio. I think 1 in 4 people in this thread actually know where their head ends and their asshole begins.
That was just only one side. I did not even mention how such orders fuck with bots who see a huge order and adjust their price accordingly. 
As a matter of fact there is a guy in this comment thread who actually has had to alter his bots to deal with such spoofing.

No man it is not that simple. A private lender can never offer the same rates as a bank. Cause the banks are playing with free money(other peoples deposit)
Private lenders do exist but there is a reason inspite of people hating banks they still chose to go to them for a mortgage or a loan for their new business.
"That means people you actually know and trust make great candidates for these kinds of transactions.'
 These words mean nothing and hold zero weight in the financial industry.People would think you are stupid if you ask a loan based on your trustworthiness. And the lender would get defrauded and go bankrupt in two days.
"You could promise the deed to your car " . You are thinking too small.

Exactly the storing of wealth is the most boring part of banking.
Not to mention people who have money in their bank acc do not check the price of dollar every 10 mins.
But bitcoiners check the price of bitcoin every 10 mins do because it is an investment just like stocks.

Thart is good. It is one of many tests bitcoin has to pass if they want mass adoption.  
This should be a good proving ground. 
Lets see whether bitcoin is still going to be used in Argentina, or else it just proves the gov can actually stop bitcoin from being used in their county. Which would be disastrous for the movement.
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:17:27
Lol,never. If  you had $310 million the bank would send a private banker for free of cost,similar  to how casinos give whales free shit.
We do this for anybody who has over $10 million,let alone $310 million.
The idea is the bank would make a lot more by maintaining a relationship in the long run. High new worth clients know how to leverage their worth they would simply go to another bank if we did not offer it.
Sorry if you disagree but that is how the real world works.

First of all bitcoin was not sold in 2010, secondly buying options can get you a return of 1000%  in a week now compound that for 7 years. You would probably have all the money in the world.
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:55:40
Ofcourse many businesses hold way more than that in their accounts,they might be holding it to pay taxes or payroll or merchants.
Also many business may not hold 300 million dollars in their account but they roll BILLIONS of dollars through their account. If you build a relationship they might even borrow a 100 million from you.
NOT MY CLIENT but one of our clients holds 100s plus million dollars in their accounts and it  is only a mid range construction company in NY.Sometimes by law you have to hold the funds in FIAT.

Probably you are going to go to a firm that will see your financial status and history and may approve you the funds to open up your business.
Hmm I wonder what are we going to call those things.And where will these firms get all these capital? Are they going to take it from the people who keep money in said firm so that they can offer very cheap rates compared to private money?
And will the government enforce strict regulations to these firms since they will be taking and lending peoples money?

People are confusing the word 'optimistic' with excited.   
It is the story of the bitcoin community, hence the volatile market.
Mass adoption is a long way off. I see the same cart before the horse mentality  
A lot of the problems bitcoin faces will apparently be solved after 'mass adoption'  
The mass will not adopt something before the problems are fixed not the other way around. Anybody who thinks that is either delusional or too desperate to accept reality or is not remotely competent to make this call.-
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:51:52
Yes when that happened people whipped out their phones and started using BTC and everything was fine. 
Where did you read when the fiat imploded the general public exchanged their last valuable for an even more volatile asset that requires the fucking internet to do transactions?
If fiat crashes people will go back to precious metals. Apparently you have not read 'things' that don't agree with you
THe last thing people will do at that stage is exchange their last valuable items to trade for something called bitcoin. They will go back to gold,when you read these 'things' written by said people I am sure they mentioned that part.
Secondly I apologize, I thought you were referring to USD imploding.Cause if the USD implodes then my point stands your bitcoin will be less valuable than a shotgun or a hot meal or safe bed or shampoo. 
Right now Venezuela is a great example. Problem is when the currency of such economies crash it rarely helps bitcoin because said country had a shit economy to begin with. They can't help bitcoin

So when you file for fraud depending on your account standing(the computer is always adjusting how much money each account can overdraft/get reimbursed etc)the bank may just give you the money upfront.  So what he got was an improvised reversal. 
They gave him the money upfront because he was in good standing, this is similar to when the bank cashes your check the same day but finds out after 2 days if the check was good.
The bank cancelled the reversal after the company challenged his dispute and produced evidence to back their claim.

Buddy regardless whether the bank uses gold or dollars or fucking dildos to give you a loan it still is a banking service. That is tied to the banking system. 
Banking system will be here even if all the paper in the world runs out. 
Hating against the banking system and then claiming bitcoin is the alternate  exposes the amount of sheer assertive ignorance in this fucking sub reddit.
Ironic you started with the line "Rofl, wtf you on about." Right back at you my friend.
Also one more thing loans may have existed in the days of gold.
But how you get the loan,from who who,and repercussions for not paying a loan has changed a lot.
 People would give loan to people they personally knew(this was common even in the 1900s)You would have to have somebody with repution vouch for you.
Now you do not even have the right to refuse a loan without showing proper reasoning.

I work for another bank, but literally we will never do that. Corporate office will simply redirect you to fraud because corporate cannot make a ruling on a fraud case.
Now they can provide you the reason, the fraud department can. And they are literally never wrong.
WHY? Because ALL BANK contrary to popular belief wants TO HELP the customer especially when it comes to fraud. IT COSTS US ZERO DOLLARS TO REVERSE TRANSACTION and win huge customer loyalty.
So the only reason it got rejected is because you actually did place that order without realize how much it would actually lost.Only way something does not get reversed is not only the company disputed the claim(they only do it if it is legit or else they just let it go) but they MUST PROVIDE EVIDENCE(hence they let it go if it is not legit).
Classic red flag " So no single payments should occur, let alone more than once a month. "
Then chase would send you a notice about said transaction, asking whether you authorized it.If you never replied then IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SECOND TRANSACTION TO GO THROUGH.
The fact you never mention it or never mention the fact they never received this (THEY EVEN EMAIL YOU)your fraud department would bring it up tells me you have a weak case. The system is literally in place to prevent this type of situations.
The most common one we get is Amazon Prime charged me 119 dollars!!!!-too fucking bad.
Sometimes it helps if you make a police report but it will not help in this situation because the police would want a paper from the bank that says a fraud actually took place.
Your only option is to keep calling them and their is a big chance they will just give you the money based on your standing with the bank.

IF chase never sent you a notification, then congrat you just found your ammunition.
Bring that up and keep bringing that up. Since that account only payed for bills the computer should have picked up an unusual transaction.
Sounds like somebody is physically using your card but that still does not explain how they did the fraud again the day you activated your card.
You should go to a branch. Maybe it is not a Debit card fraud but an ACH fraud. In ACH fraud they do not require a debit card they NEITHER send you any notification and it also does not require CONSENT from the account holder.  And it is a BITCH to reverse it which is why gyms and other subscription use this method.

They make most of their money through services. Where will you get a loan,mortgage or credit? It does not change if the world is using Fiat or cow shit as currency, the services would be required. You will ahve to prove your credibility in order to get such services/
Not to mention if Bitcoin goes mainstream people will start storing them in banks for safety.

*sigh*  Can you speak like a normal human being? Also wtf is that diarrhea. Are you 15 years old and trying to sound smart?
WTF are you talking about constitutional courts. "constitutional courts." will not come in play because it has already been upheld that the US gov has the right to prevent US companies from accepting certain forms of payment.
How do you think sanctions work? Why do you think Iran has to go thru such trouble to acquire US dollars?
Ofcourse a gov can make up any reason to protect their own economy. That itself is a great reason.  You think they can invade countries with bs reason that results in the death of 100,000 but they cannot ban something like cryptocurreny something the bankers already dislike?

THis is so frustrating. It is like trying to teach math.Is this the first time you are dealing with this? You never researched what may happen if the US banned all crypto?
At the moment the farmer takes the coin and converts it to fiat to pay for taxes or does business with other business with said bitcoin.
If bitcoin is banned he cannot convert it to other fiat neither can he pay other real business since they will not accept a currency that is not allowed by the US gov.He will also have to hide all his income since if he declared he took Bitcoin as payment then he would be in trouble. So he would be vulnerable to the IRS. You think he will risk his business? Most wont.Esp since if US bans it then they will aggressively come for people who defy the order.
Most people including ALL INSTITUTIONS which by law cannot invest in crypto if it is banned will withdraw their money. Prices will crash. These are basic economics. If you have further basic questions do your research.

So while you save are you going to reinvest that money to make more money? Cause if you reinvest you stand to loose all that money. And if you are not reinvesting then you are just wasting that money holding on to it while the price of everything increases in time.
All this to escape a 3-5% interest?

Well a hedge fund manager once wired them 750m dollars. He was told the money would be used for CIA black missions.
He himself was a ponzi scheme artist and was growing desperate as the money was running out.

 THe familiy spends $50,000 dollars on clothes,vacation and food and lives in a 1.2 million dollar house. Sends kids to private school and saves 38000(more than what many people make a year) a year for retirement .  
It is not a middle class lifestyle

Remember the post yesterday about 'censoring' posts that spread "misinformation" because we do not have time to correct all the fake news about bitcoin.  
And I got voted down when I pointed out half the shit over her is misinformation.   
Well look at this post, by this logic any stock forget bitcoin can be reach a billion dollars if we do not take into fact we live in a real world and not fantasy land.

Oh no, you will be able to do it. And you will probably have to pay 1000000 BTC to buy a bike if all crypto is banned. 
Because John probably suffers from brain damage and is accepting a currency which he cannot use to buy anything from a store. HE can either take cash and have the freedom to spend it or take a banned currency that he cannot use anywhere.
You really haven't put a lot of thought into this have you?
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:30:25
I agree, that is what I was trying to show
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:03:43
Why does the US gov put sanctions?
Look at all my replies.
Why do people keep asking me basic questions? 
All your answers can be found online but that would require to do an unbiased research. 
AKA do not go to a crypto website to look for your answers.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:26:18
" How are they going to ban it? "
THE SAME WAY THEY DO WITH CURRENCIES or sanctions.
They can just ask all US and European companies not to accept Bitcoin. They can do it overnight , all it would take is to convince a bunch of old politicians that bitcoin is bad news for the 'country'
If you are not aware how they can turn it off then you certainly are not aware of basic economic principles
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:09:19
You read my whole argument and the only thing you have to mention is 'hey man not all people who do drugs are addicts' When did I say that? The only reason I got exposed to bitcoin is because I needed it to buy weed from Dreammarket(dark net) now I use Empire
Shouldn't you be more concerned that these retarded posts still exist and even more retarded people come up with even more retarded reasons to justify HODL.

Makes no difference its allowed in bitfinex.
So if it was a case of spoofing then the order would be cancelled once it reaches a pre determined price. Guess what the order has been cancelled. It was indeed just a case of spoofing.

What he is doing is called spoofing. His faking interest in hopes of selling his dough for a higher price. Spoof trading is unfortunately legal in GDAX
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:43:51
This is spoof trading 101
He is faking interest in hopes people will buy his coins for a higher price.
 And just like a typical spoof the order is cancelled as soon as it reaches a pre determined price

The guy who painted FB's first office got paid in stocks and is worth 100s of million.
The 3rd founder of Apple sold his stock share for a fucking car.One guy got offered 10% of nike or 100,000 dollars cause that is how cheap the stock of Nike was.
ALMOST all stocks start at decimal values.
BTW the guy chose the $100,000,OUCH

Same shit everyday. Everyday they regurgitate the same illiterate bs
Look there is a million reasons why you should invest in bitcoin but QUIT with this bs.   
If the US gov and Europe bans all crypto currency from being used in their commerce then wtf are you going to do? 
And the worse part is everybody knows this. But they just ignore and upload and spread these stupid message.
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:29:19
Yes it was. I should have made it more clear.
@_date: 2019-09-14 08:38:49
You do not have any idea...The country will simply penalize FB for not following the court order. Or ban any financial institutions from doing business with FB.That is how they got rid of online poker in the US. It is not illegal to play or host online poker. It is just illegal for financial institutions to process any of the payments.
You think this is the the first time these countries are dealing with controlling something with the influence of bureaucracy?How ignorant do you have to be to think you have thought of something they didn't.

Until bitcoin can come up with mortgage and loans this guy is just another mouthpiece who knows how to get headlines that gets retweeted and shared a lot.
And when it comes up with mortgage then they have became what they were trying to replace.

I guess this is how people stay in a bubble. 
I bring up a point and your reply is Derp but not all people are addicts. 
Then I point out how stupid it is to focus on something that irrelevant. And you reply leave me alone!!!!
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:36:25
" It's others who create these headlines on their own initiative and time. " Yes that is what getting a headline means. Politicians who use buzzwords do not create the actual headlines themselves.   
Besides what does he have to say about providing mortgage and loans to people? That is what I think we should focus more on than if he can create headlines or not.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:37:47
Man I will not argue any further. This is my last reply
for which fiat do such black markets exist? 
If you spent a second to answer one of these three question then you wound not have sent this reply. 
THERE IS NO BLACK MARKET for currencies that is banned in US and Europe.If you think there is then you do not understand how money even works.
Dude why are you not doing your own research. This is for your own good.
Right now you are literally pulling shit out of your ass-and for what?
It is in your best interest to actually know the dangers Crypto faces so you can make an 'informed' decision.
@_date: 2019-09-13 19:31:29
This post is tailored for all the illiterates who use headlines to justify their actions.What kind of a headline is this? A headline that hopes their readers will agree with the headline and move on
This BULLSHIT WEBSITE literally stole the $35000 article from another BULLSHIT website.
You will find their '350000' ledger on this site  [
THe familiy spends $50,000 dollars on clothes,vacation and food and lives in a 1.2 million dollar house. How is that a middle class lifestyle??????
The numbers have been over-bloated. They can easily save a$100,000 a year.
Edit: I live in Queens village and I make $80,000 a year(which is the average for anybody who is busting their ass in NY) and yes I spend more than them on vacations. But I budget the rest. This article is a joke.

I am not going to continue this anymore.
  Yes the US gov will not prevent you from using Bitcoin That is your right cause you are a 'domestic subject', jsut like you are allowed to gamble online or eat your own shit .
THE US GOV WILL AND CAN  BAN businesses and banks from accepting certain payments or currencies.That is how they got rid of online gambling.And that has been already been through the courts. 
I do not think you understand how the constitutional courts work. They set a precedent.
The US gov has the right to limit business from using certain currencies. This precedent has already been set.
Nobody will want a currency they cannot use at a store. Large institutions cannot invest in it if it is against the law.

You CONSUME drugs based on a FUCKING [ADDICTION.](  It also makes you irrational and not see the [downside.]( You will ruin your life and even suck dicks for drugs. That is why the price stays high, how stupid do you have to be to compare it to crpyto?
Having retards like you in my side is not only embarrassing but very worry some.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:51:16
Nah man people who are addicted to drugs are great business minded investors. They weigh up the market upside and downside, they look at reward vs risk factor then they make their decision to INVEST in drugs. 
That is why drug addicts are known to be the smartest buyers of commodities in the world.
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:12:04
Yup calling people out for comparing drugs to crypto is incoherent rambling.
I guess labeling a valid argument as incoherent rambling is another way to stay in the bubble. How enlightening.Idiot.
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:56:48
lol this is spoof trading 101. 
They are faking interest in order to sell their coins at a higher price. 
And once a pre determined price is reached then the order will be cancelled
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:48:28
Yes you know what you are correct. The prices will not drop because everybody will keep buying bitcoin even if it gets banned since Crypto is as addictive as drugs. They buy it cause of addiction not as an investment. 
That is what you wanted to hear right? For me to agree with you regardless of how stupid it sounds?  
Now I know how people still exist in these bubbles. You guys shun any info that is not pro bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:17:51
Yes the same can be said for cash.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:40:02
You can't. They require you to send a pic of your ID. The newer ones can even scan your driver license on the spot. 
New regulations require them to do this.

I live in NY. 
There is a reason coinbase asks for your social. Please let me know which company has ATM's that let you buy coins without ID. Name me the company.
I can name me the 4 bitcoin ATM companies in US and they all require ID.
 On March 18, 2013, the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the US Department of the Treasury, found that bitcoin is a “decentralized convertible virtual currency.” This means that FinCEN sees no difference officially between bitcoin transmitters and fiat currency transmitters.
For those who may find it difficult to understand what that means. It means bitcoin ATMS face same regulations as Western Unions AND 
Are you in China? Cause you can buy bitcoin without ID over there but not in US transmitter businesses must play by federal rules – especially when it comes to anti-money laundering/know-your-customer protections (AML/KYC), as defined by the Bank Secrecy Act – if they want to enjoy the same courtesy. This created a push to “get right or get out” among bitcoin businesses.
SERIOUSLY this is 2018 do your research

ROFL....Yes retail Banks regularly deny applications based on your charge off history.. And you oversee a billion bucks and were trying to use a fucking cell phone app to invest? ON A APP THAT DOES NOT LET YOU DEPOSIT MILLIONS. Wow almost sound like you are so full of shit you do not even have a clue how stupid you sound
Banks regularly close accounts without explanation. And they do it for large account and businesses aswel. Because it will cost us 10x more if it is found out they are involved in money laundering.
