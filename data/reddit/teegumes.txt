Ehhhhh we found Roger Are you getting paid time and a half for working tonight?

r/btc is like a crazy ass ex-girlfriend. They(bcash) left and just can't shut the fuck up about r/bitcoin. They will never be their own entity because they are trying too hard to be bitcoin rather than just become independent.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:32:01
What about when bitcoin cash copy and pastes segwit/lightning network because Roger said it will work better on bitcoin cash? Then who gets what name
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:28:23
Probably enough change under your couch cushions to get you by while lightning continues to be tested and rolled out. Check under your washer and dryer that's a hotspot too.

I thought we already knew this and that British Columbia in Canada was going to become popular as a mining hot spot due to the hydro powered electricity there.

Love all these early adopters coming out and giving to good causes. Now we just need Friedcat to come back.

I will switch all my paper wallets over to segwit once bitaddress.org includes it in their wallet maker.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:42
People need to realize that the technology will speak the loudest in the end. Not a BCash spokesman.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:18:42
Right here is proof that Roger has started his boys in on the acceptance of Segwit/Lightning Network coming to Bcash. They used to fight tooth and nail against it but as soon as Roger did his CNBC Fast Money interview they have all started to accept it. The sad thing is that we can not stop it because everything is open source.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:55:45
What you're doing stands out just as much! The amount isn't the thing people focus on(well sometimes it is) but its the spirit and humanity that truly counts. Three of you have stood out so much this last week.. deannolan, PineappleFund, and Tether_is_Fiat.

I've recently been looking for an iOS wallet for when I introduce people to bitcoin and they have iPhones... so far im having a real big problem finding something that I can include watch only public addresses into.

Pushing Andreas into the limelight may not be something he wants. All his talks and everything has been organically achieved and now with the donations it seems like the bitcoin community believes that they can send Andreas wherever they see fit.
I agree he would talk beautifully wherever he goes but we need to let this man live his life and spread bitcoin knowledge like he has been all along.

TOR is an important space on the internet and in the net neutrality fight.

Use bitaddress.org to make your paper wallets.

Jameson Lopp speaks calm and explains a lot about some of the inward workings of Bitcoin right now. Roger Ver is on the constant attack and only responds in a tone that shows frustration. No knowledge is gained about Bitcoin Cash from listening to this podcast.

Its basically going to end up being PayPal 2.0, short term it has advantages due to low fees but long term they have no significant code or development being worked on other than their plan to copy and paste Segwit/Lightning Network. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:40:42
I agree that competition is good but the hostility between our two communities has just become disgusting. Both coins should be able to co-exist and I do agree that both sides could implement and adjust things that seem to work. If you listen to some of the interviews out there it is usually a developer from BTC explaining future things and then since Roger Ver has become the public face of BCH/BCC he does nothing but attack BTC and spin peoples words, then runs off to news.bitcoin.com and writes some garbage article. I think if you removed Roger from the situation both communities could learn to live alongside each other. There doesn't have to be a hostile takeover of any coin.

yea its like talking to a wall. have a merry christmas roger
BCH/BCC roadmap: CTRL C   CTRL V
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:44
This is only my opinion but I see any coin out there having problems if they suddenly got gangbanged by the masses like bitcoin recently. I consider this a stress test and what do you know.. bitcoin is still standing.
 Lightning Network won't be rushed out and it shouldn't be.. the developers overly test everything they've released and their track record is proven so far. That is where my trust is. They don't have time to be doing AMA's and creating YouTube videos.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:15:26
Copy and pasting open source code is a non-crime. Bitcoin Cash will implement Segwit/Lightning Network to cling to life.

10/10 would buy
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:34:10
first things first sell enough to make life comfy for yourself. you dont need to sell all of them. make yourself mortgage/debt free and then go from there. enjoy the life that collecting bitcoin way back then has earned you.

Their one graphic says BCT rather than BTC lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:08:36
Bcash supporters STILL can't decide if they are BCH or BCC. That's where the whole debacle started.

Worth $1,277,000USD at the time of WoodCollector's last post, so bitcoin was about $255USD each.
I consider myself to be 5%/5%/90%    real/fake/curiousity, there's a large laaaarge chance that its not true, but as a collector that's what gets you hooked, its not the real or the fake part, its the god damn curiousity.
Some people buy lottery tickets expecting to win each week. Instead I bought wood coins that are a unique collection and I can always display as art in my home worse comes to worse. I am completely fine with that aswell.
@_date: 2019-04-05 12:32:49
Point well received. Also thank you for the suggestion about the weights possibly being a clue factor. Next week I will be bumping my thread on bitcointalk and brainstorming with the community about various ways to try and unlock clues without 
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:22:16
Yea, its more of a  finds its way to me now... there were no real clues or anything public about ownership/existence.
Slowly putting pieces into place to try and narrow it down, but lack of information is the biggest problem right now.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:18:26
We have seen this sort of organic growth in the old bitcoin unlimited days
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:03:39
Last time Lopp was on a talk show with Roger the whole bcash gang spun his words and ran headlines/reddit threads with it. I doubt he ever puts himself in that situation again.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:49:41
Here is why all Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporters want everyone and their dog to "debate" Roger and CSW. To spin up their words for propaganda articles on the news.websitewedontname.com page and to plaster them all over r/btc.

Try downloading a wallet on your phone like mycelium. You can manually type the private key into it after selecting cold storage.
