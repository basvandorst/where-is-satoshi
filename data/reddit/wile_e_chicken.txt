Ok, thanks for the picture of how this is supposed to work. My copy of MultiBit is several years old, maybe there's been some change to the blockchain or a bug... Anyhow, I installed a newer wallet; will play with that and see how it goes.

Neither transaction is found blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info -- the built-in explorers for Multibit. But Multibit says the first transaction is seen by 9 peers and the second is seen by 3 peers. Weird.
And both the Transaction Record and overall Balance on MultiBit are just... wrong. No idea what's going on here.

transaction size: 0.069197
fee: 0.0001
I don't have a feel for whether this is ludicrously low or what; it's just what Multibit adds.
~~The first transaction took about an hour, but~~ the second one from last night *still* hasn't been confirmed. It says "seen by 3 peers". edit: Actually it looks like the first one still hasn't been confirmed either.

Yeah I saw that it added a small fee amount with the transaction, but there's no way to edit it. 
So assuming the fee was okay, which I can only hope, it sounds like the 15 minute Bitpay timeout window is far too short to be useful.

0.0001 BTC/MB -- but I didn't see a way to change that in MultiBit. 
I've switched to the newer MultiBitHD and it has an option to change it, so I doubled it to 0.0002 and it seems to work great.

What's it called when I obsessively refresh Blockfolio every 2 minutes but don't make any market moves?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:33
Define "ownership". Access to a string of hexidecimals?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:31:23
Along those same lines, how do you answer: "So, what do you *do?*"
My best answer is "Internet stuff."
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:21:24
Only if you know the private keys.. I guess? Whole thing makes no sense.

The wind in your face wipes the tears away.

Given the whole pizzagate scandal, I honestly wonder if these weren't pizzas but rather children.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:56:24
4000 if you include BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:55:24
FWIW I never thought the Internet would catch on -- it was just too technically difficult back in the day, I figured Joe Public would never have the patience.
Yeah I missed that call.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:59:51
Do. It. Vladi.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:28:44
Yeah but he immediately invested that $800 in bitcoin. In 1976. Think about it. (But not too hard.)
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:47:41
I like how the code is commented. *AS IF.*
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:49:04
Seems to me this is a great job for smartcontracts. Seems to me there is a fantastic business opportunity here.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:09:21
I don't know how to feel about this.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:29:13
I got a Corolla with Lambo doors. FUCK YOU.

It's like a documentary.

You mean accelerated quickly! BWAAAAAAAA :chirp: BuuWAAAAAAAA
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:43:35
Does not compute.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:51:54
Dunno how to feel about this.

In terms of influence, Israel is neither small nor benevolent -- hence my conflict.

Add zero-point energy amplifiers wound via toroid-based geometry and you'll quintuple your output. (Amateurs...)
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:55:10
Agreed.. I'm beginning to get the sense that we're just running R&amp;D for the big banks' new one world currency(ies) that will tokenize every aspect of reality.
Not sure what the greater implications are. But I also have the sense that the US is about to go down, controlled demolition style. Putting 2 and 2 together, Asian cryptos may be a better bet.

Heckuva paper wallet cypher you got there.
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:09:42
I kind of agree, but man this gets complicated. It's also a way to economically conquer and subjugate the planet without firing a shot. Really curious where this is all going.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:49:44
Way more complicated than that. With direct-to-consumer fund-raising, easily swayed by Public Relations, an inferior coin with really good PR could increase in value. Or a great technology with crap PR could fail miserably. And there are all points in between. Freekin wild west out here.

I ran across a Latin American version of the Monopoly board game. It was called "El Banco Grande" -- literally "The Big Bank". Too real for us gringos, I suppose.
