There are regulations in Sweden on how large the campaign contributions can be though. 20,000SEK/2,900USD/2150EUR for individuals each and half of that if it's a company or organization donating. 
Sure keeping track of that when donations are coming in with Bitcoin could be quite difficult.

Just because someone hasn't created a program that executes a set number of commands and editing the correct entries in the registry doesn't mean that the OS is less open. These programs exists on windows because more people use it, thus there is more incentive to create the programs that aggregate these commands.
My point was that if we, in a theoretical scenario, reduce the difference in availability of these programs so that they are equal on both OSX and Windows, the openness of both system would actually be comparable. If someone is lazy and doesn't want to enter CMD or Regedit by themselves that won't contribute to the argument of either side.
As a side note, I'm not taking either side here. I use both ecosystems on a daily basis. I study computer science at my university and I'm deeply entrenched in the Microsoft .NET environment as well as having used MacBooks (and iPads) for portability for a very long time.

I woke up today and found out another deposit at bitstamp had gone through, without problems.

however, due to the unix like structure and the bash terminal it is fairly easy to bend the os to your will, if you know what to do. Thus, if the selection of software and tools etc were of equal volume for both windows and osx, you'd be hard pressed stating windows was more open.

The name of the bookmark defaults to the page title. These sites usually lists the price in the page title for the website. They won't automatically update though, only when you manually edit.

Similarly the prefixes work the other way around:
* micro = 0.001
* nano = 0.000001
These are prefixes that literally translates to a numeric value so you can attach them to any unit. Welcome to the metric system.

You're mixing up terminology though. Bit and byte are the unit while klilo, mega etc are the prefixes that indicate the amount of the unit. 
* Kilo = 1,000
* Mega = 1,000,000
* Giga = 1,000,000,000 
* Tera = 1,000,000,000,000
* etc.
Given there will only be 21 million BTC naming then giga, tera or peta would be useless since one MegaBTC would already mean one million BTC. Therefore there can only ever be 21 MegaBTC.
Sure you can use those terms, but don't think they would be very common since they'd be worth so much.

well. I sold 1.5 BTC a few weeks ago after the price being stuck at 200 for so long, two days later the prices started to skyrocket lol.

Well, if we want it to be different we can't use prefixes that already has a very specific universal meaning :)

It'll move sideways for two blocks then turn right by the streetlight.

If you mean upper limit as in the maximum number of coins there will never be more than 21 million BTC. 
The amount generated per new block found is halved every 4 years, until the 21millionth coin has been produced.
