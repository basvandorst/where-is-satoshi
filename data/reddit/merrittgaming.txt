I've just stopped caring. Every time I think I've figured out a pattern or trend the market just throws a spanner in the works. (Also I was fucking retarded, got out a few months back, then got back in late in the game :| ) Might as well let it sit and see what happens, cause at my age I can afford to lose everything, so the risk is worth it to me.

Because Mark Cuban took a shit at 10:02 this morning, and because Jeff Bezos' mail ran about 5 minutes late last Tuesday. In a world of  minute details, anything can make Bitcoin shift.

Shit, I'm just gonna ride this out of dodge and, just maybe, if BCH starts to feel the heat and dips soon, I'll snap up some to help spread out my portfolio a bit more

Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptos did very well while they were flying under the radar. However, it's becoming more mainstream, what with CME and the NYSE picking up interest in it, which I believe is causing people to lose faith in the old system of "the average joe's currency," and is bringing down prices with it as more people back out and drive up the volume of coin on the market.

Decided to pull about half of my current investment. Gonna leave the rest and see how the market changes leading up to the fork. In the meantime, probably gonna put that extra cash to work in alt-coins, seeing as they might take a decent jump soon

The dude is like 50 something and 5'7". Best chance he has is to buy the sun and channel its light to bounce off his bald head like a giant beam of death (which from the ridiculousness of that idea, i think Musk will beat him to it lol)
