I took a screen shot and closed my browser. Not worried though since everything is in cold storage. Just passing this along for anyone using sensitive information anywhere near this.

Not sure how serious this is but I noticed this box popped up while my markets.blockchain.info page was up. A minute later another message popped up that I failed to ss but said something like "yt hack". This could potentially be a serious vulnerability for a website that is responsible for so much information. Just wanted to bring it to your attention if there is XSS'ing going on you might want to hold off on logging into your wallets on blockchain.info (or even visiting the site).

Not necessarily. It means that someone through a cross-site-scripting vulnerability (most likely) was able to produce this message on the page. The question is whether that is the only vulnerability or not. I suspect if someone had more access they wouldn't broadcast those messages, but better safe than sorry.
