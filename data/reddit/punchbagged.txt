is there such a thing as a decentralised exchange for BTC?  Something like IDEX where I could trade Bitcoin without having to sign up, do KYC etc?

Thanks so much for the detailed response.  The one remaining question in my mind is: if I originally had a total of 1 BTC before the split to BCH, what's stopping me from paying you 1 BCH, and then paying someone else 1 BTC?  (my understanding is that if I sent 1 BCH to you, it would be valid on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain and an invalid transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain - which would mean I could make a later valid transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain taking the same old (pre-fork) transaction as an input?)
I guess I don't understand the idea behind how "people dumped their BCH for BTC" - how can you dump what is essentially a number that is shared on the pre-fork blockchain of both projects?  You mean the act of creating a new Bitcoin (BTC) valid transaction someone invalidates that on the BCH network?

You’re fooling yourself if by “invest in BTC” you mean you want to own BTC.  
Robinhood don’t let you withdraw the crypto you’ve purchased.  What happens if they go bankrupt?  Or get hacked?  
Of course that doesn’t mean it’s “safe” for the average investor to be responsible for their own security either - there’s a bit of a learning curve.
With Robinhood though you’re essentially playing bitcoin derivatives and have no idea if they even have internal bitcoin reserves to cover all the BTC sales they’ve made.  And even if that’s ok for you, why wouldn’t you do that with a similar service (e.g. Coinbase) that will let you withdraw one day if you decide to?

It’s a lot of things - if you try and sum it up with a sentence you’ll get a lot of “experts” who disagree with your classification.  I like the digital gold analogy, also the idea of it being some kind of “truth machine” that tells the truth about a data set that happens to be bitcoin transactions.
Just read the white paper though and you’ll probably come up with your own way to describe it

That doesn’t answer my question though?  Forks are springing up in both bitcoin and altcoins where the community decides who wins.  Why is it so key that in Bitcoin the core project avoids the major protocol or blockchain change?

Yes, Bitcoin will rise.  The problem is that it will also fall.
When will it do either?  Don’t know, but regularly.
How far will it rise/fall?  Don’t know, quite a bit probably?
My advice is that if you have investments and don’t urgently need the money back, at least wait until 6 months after the next halving before capitulating.

Thanks for the response - you think this is a better approach than say, buying a 1Tb external HDD that I sync to the latest blockchain any time I intend to code?  Got no experience with these services / apis but seems from first glance they have a largely different syntax and commands to the bitcoin core software?  Part of me thinks an external HDD is a better solution at least to stay consistent in that sense

If you put your 6k in and bitcoin drops 50% will you...
a) shit yourself and cash out at a 50% loss
b) shit yourself, try to cash out, but accidentally send to invalid address losing the remainder of your funds
c) recite “1 BTC = 1 BTC” while stemming the tide of your tears with hours of bitcoin memes and delta checking 
If you’re ready for c) you should invest

Very cool idea - will check it out later

The thing making my hands extra strong right now is that if Bitcoin demand maintains a steady level (i.e. no growth necessary) then the next halving will push the price up “significantly” (whatever that means).  Quite an incredible thought that this asset is hardcoded to moon assuming steady demand.
So, in a word...price.  I HODL for price-go-uppy
@_date: 2019-12-27 20:14:13
Yeah - and if you assume constant demand (no need for increases/manias) bitcoin’s price has to rise due to decreases in new supply.
Only counterargument could be that halvings are already priced in which I find highly dubious as well as the general efficient markets hypothesis (particularly with a totally new kind of asset like bitcoin)
@_date: 2019-12-21 12:53:10
Yeah that’s interesting but imagine the US made trading in bitcoin illegal.  Ok so maybe a lot of business moves outside the US but I have a hard time believing it doesn’t have an overall negative impact on price.  Your average US retail investor just wouldn’t fight the government and the chances of pulling more US retail investors into the space would be severely hindered.
Don’t know why I’m getting downvotes for pointing this out - isn’t it a legitimate hesitation for everyone who’s at least got one eye on the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-14 12:15:50
What the hell is the use case this scam is playing on?  Never heard of Bitcoin Blender or dedicated mixing service - I mean there’s no minimum limit on the protocol level on what you can send so how can this scam attract people?  What does it do that a wallet like electrum wouldn’t?

Thanks but kinda hard to find that specific video without more of an idea on the general topic he was speaking about - that man is prolific!

“Priced in” refers to the simple idea that free markets can act as mechanisms to predict future value.
E.g. if a barrel of oil is trading at $50 today but everyone finds out that Saudi Arabia will stop selling to the world in 2021, that event would be “priced in” to some extent before 2021 because people would understand the price is likely to rise in future and so begin valuing current price higher than it was (i.e. buyers would be prepared to pay more and sellers would expect more).
Same thing with Bitcoin but what’s especially amazing is that there’s no other asset where the future supply is so accurately predictable - so in theory it does give the markets a better chance to “price it in” - e.g. if everyone was aware of (and believed in the power of) the halvings then there’d be no reason for bitcoin’s price not to be valued higher now and then change little when the halving actually occurs.
So it’s a very simple idea: if the price of something is $1 today but you expect it to rise to $100 by next week, then obviously you’re prepared to pay much more than $1 for it now (and sellers expect more) - maybe you wouldn’t pay the full $100 now if you’re not 100% about your hypothesis, but the fact you’re paying more than the $1 current value means you’re pricing in the future and in doing so the overall market price will rise

Remember that Bitcoin is divisible to 100m satoshis.  In reality there is no bidding war - everything is just a function of price.
Regardless of that, what you’re saying really is that even if the halving is “priced in”, price will still go up after the halving because of a reduction in new supply.  That would be true only if you forget about the demand side - and if we’re assuming free and efficient markets the demand side would recognise they’d already priced in the supply drop!  So if the markets had perfectly efficiently priced in the halving, then when the halving occurs (and the new supply decreases by 50%), the markets would not pay/expect more for the new/smaller flow of bitcoin.
I’m not actually arguing this is what happens though - I don’t believe in maximally efficient markets and especially not in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-28 11:48:44
“After the halvening that amount will never be the same, it will be half that and everyone that normally bought coins are probably still wanna buy coins. They will either get half the coins or have to pay twice as much”
The final sentence here is not necessarily true.  The demand side is subjective - if we assume the halving IS priced in, by the time the halving occurs it won’t have any effect because we have to assume rational actors in the free market won’t price it in twice.  You’re hinting at a demand side mathematical relationship by saying “half the coins or pay twice as much” - that only exists in the minds of the market participants which in an efficient market won’t price in the halving on 2 separate occasions.  Only the supply side has a mathematically predictable relationship in bitcoin - the rest of the price equation is standard free market dynamics.
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:10:22
What’s the most compelling counter argument to the idea that eventually governments will clamp down on bitcoin and crash the price in the process (since legit companies, exchanges etc will no longer be able to deal in it).
I get the technology will remain but as an investor I think this is a risk built into the asset

Amateur hour question:  if I delete the secret words/phrase thing that enables me to recover my wallet, and just remember the private key(s) in the wallet, what am I losing?  Just the convenience of being able to restore the wallet from a single string?  Seems hardly worth it since it’s an extra piece of information I need to keep secure and could in theory lose?
I’m thinking of simply downloading some wallet software to create the private/public pair, moving some BTC to this address from an exchange, then deleting the software and the secret phrase and only storing the private key.  Bad idea?
@_date: 2019-04-13 08:50:26
Oh very interesting- thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:29:35
What’s the safest way to generate a public/private key pair for a BTC wallet?  Like is it possible to do completely offline or manually?  Or do I need to trust that the wallet software I download isn’t simultaneously secretly emailing the private key I’m creating to the creators of the software behind the scenes?
@_date: 2019-04-13 00:31:04
Did you save your private keys or secret seed phrase before updating the software?
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:26:50
I guess I like the idea of limiting the number of things I’m having to store/protect and consider the private key more fundamental so wouldn’t dream of deleting that.  Thanks for confirming I don’t actually “need” the seed phrase though!

After you create the wallet/address (which you can do via electrum while not connected to the internet if you’re a little paranoid), as long as you keep your seed words and any wallet password safe then you can completely wipe the wallet software or set your computer on fire and your address will still be yours.
Just keep the seed and any password as well as the public address so you can send BTC to it
