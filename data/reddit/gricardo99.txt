I'm not sure what world [Rism]( lives in.  Let’s face it, bitcoin is just not great for the average Joe right now.  It’s getting there, and I believe it will get there, but there are many problems to solve.  
Let's look at the real-word:
**No identity theft**
~~Unlike credit cards, Bitcoin does not require any personally-identifiable information.~~
If you're using circle, coinbase, bitpay, or the many other user-friendly bitcoin payment/wallet/merchant services, you still have personal information exposure.   Even if you bypass these, you still need to acquire bitcoins, which is via some centralized exchange or other service where you very likely do have to expose your personal information due to the various AML/KYC policies of these services.  Worse in fact if you consider that this space is largely unregulated. 
**Protect your money**
~~The ability to make backups and encrypt your funds allows for an unprecedented level of security.~~
The average Joe has no idea how to ensure they have adequately encrypted/backed-up their bitcoins.  The average Joe has virtually no risk with credit cards or banks.  Credit cards by-and-large have 100% fraud protection, doesn't directly cost you a dime.  Banks are FDIC insured, your money is safe.  
**Send money instantly, anywhere, at any time**
~~Much like the internet, Bitcoin spans the entire globe and can never be shut down.~~
The most user-friendly bitcoin services for the average Joe are centralized, and could be restricted, frozen, have down-time, etc... 
**Funds cannot be restricted or frozen**
~~Bitcoin is decentralized, no single person or group controls it and no one has the power to seize your assets~~
Same as above.  Most average users will need some simplified service.  
**No arbitrary limits or fees**
~~With Bitcoin, there are no banks to impose arbitrary fees, and there are no withdrawal limits or holds on deposits.~~
Exchange/service fees for acquiring bitcoins are currently very high.  Much higher than debit cards and credit cards (if you don’t hold a balance).  
**No unapproved charges**
~~Transactions are always initiated by you; garnishments and recurring charges cannot happen with Bitcoin.~~
That’s true, but the flip side is as a customer once I pay for something there’s no way to get my money back.  With credit cards I can dispute a charge and recover my funds.  In terms of consumer protections, as a payment method, bitcoin is inferior.  
**No barriers to entry**
~~Bitcoin is free to use; anyone in the world can download a digital wallet.~~
It’s not simple or cheap (high fees and transaction costs) to acquire bitcoins.   Download whatever you want, you don’t have bitcoins yet.  And once you get them (losing easily 1-2% of your money along the way, exposing your personal information to some exchange/service of uncertain reputation), does the average Joe really know how to keep it safe?  Come on!  Barriers are huge.

Personally, First I'd try sell/withdraw via Ripple (If we see XRP going up, price offsets between BTCbitstamp and other BTC gatways in ripple, this could be an indication), then yes, I might take my changes with a fiat withdrawl if Bitstamp hotwallet/BTC security remains an issue/concern.

Airing of dirty laundry, which is already mostly known/public.  But it's really going for the jugular with the banking and IRS angle.  If some bad press can give Wells Fargo cold feet and even sever ties with Stripe/Stellar, that's going to be really bad for business.  Raise enough questions to get the IRS poking around, likewise not good for business.  I wonder who could possibly want to stick it to Stellar and McCaleb?
