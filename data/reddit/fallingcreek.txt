30-50% would be considered a dip....

FYI, bitcoin is a 100 percent public block chain.  Your assets can and will be tracked. Try using a private block chain.

Your post shows a major lack of understanding regarding the underlying technology.  Blockchain tech is exactly how the world will manage and transfer cash.  Perhaps Bitcoin or ETH  aren't the answers for the long term, but this technology will create a long term answer.

I know.  I'm an amateur miner myself.  I'm talking about mining farms.  Also, posts with the words mining get bounced.
Thank you for the link though!

Google the title.

I mean; you can google just as easy as the rest of us.  It's a report from CNBC.  I'm not attaching the link given that you're acting like a prick.

I'd sell now and buy back at 1,100

Nonsense.  Your school of thought is Monday morning quarterbacking.
The American people, and the world, have reaped massive benefits from the advent of the American Banking System and an American Empire.  We've reaped even bigger benefits after removing the gold standard.  These developments have allowed our world to grow at a much faster rate, and today the majority of the world lives outside of poverty because of that.
Yes, we have a ways to go.  Yes the system should be dynamic and allow changes to happen.  Yes we should steer away from warfare.  Yes, the modern banking system will help further the development of a better world.

Uhhhh.... prosperity has massively increased over the past 50 years.  Look at any emerging market.  
Let's get back on topic.  Cryptocurrencies are the future.  It is best that these currencies are decentralized.  
An important thing to remember is that growth happens through debt.  Free floating currencies have allowed this growth to happen at a much faster rate.  It will be interesting to watch how the growth through debt model plays out in Crypto.  
Which brings up a question - if bitcoin acts as a store of value, what mechanism (coins?) will we use to facilitate debt and growth?
