This is a never-ending war. Read up on cypherpunk history. First they tried to outlaw PGP. Then SSL. Then tried to mandate a "clipper chip". Now they want a backdoor in every messaging app.
Thus far they've failed to get what they want and crypto has won every battle, which gives cause for optimism. On the other hand, we're still far from having universal end-to-end encryption in all our personal communications.

What if it's not the Chinese govt that controls Jihan but the bankers with their fiat printing press? After all, they're the ones who are existentially threatened by Bitcoin and thus have the greatest reason to destroy it. The Chinese govt, on the other hand, has the means (China produces the ASICs) and motive to mine and hoard as much BTC as it can (via their puppet Jihan, if he is their puppet) and support the healthy development of a single decentralized chain so the value of its hoard will grow as much as possible (assuming the govt is acting in its own best interests and not those of said bankers).

If I'm not mistaken this is the current situation with RBF (others can correct me if I'm wrong):
+ There's no way currently to create an RBF transaction with Bitcoin Core, though a JSON RPC is in the works. Many other wallets are already RBF-enabled though.
+ It's full RBF, so yes, you can change the receiving address.
+ If the miner is running RBF-enabled Core, the replaceable transaction will be replaced automatically in the mempool if the replacing tx has a higher fee.
+ The success rate depends on how many miners are running RBF-enabled Core.

Only in the sense that you can only connect to listening nodes, not to other non-listening nodes like yourself. In every other respect, you're a full-fledged node like any other, relaying transactions and validating the blockchain—and thus supporting the network.

It would also give the Core team the moral high ground. They could say "See, we've done everything we could to compromise."

Olivier, how many datacenters do we need for DatacenterCoin to remain decentralized? 50? 100? And how long before those datacenters end up in the hands of one or a few powerful entities? (Indeed, how do we know they're not centrally controlled in the first place?)
But the main point is this: even if by some miracle those datacenters remain independent and don't collude with each other (but again, how will we know if they do?), ordinary users, including tech-savvy ones, will be forced to rely on **trusted third parties** to validate transactions. This violates one of the key principles of Bitcoin, **trustlessness.**
Here's how Satoshi announced Bitcoin to the world:


And here are some selected quotes from the whitepaper:












The last quote is the **first sentence** of the whitepaper's **concluding paragraph.**
Any more evidence needed that trustlessness was at the center of Satoshi's vision?

Chinese banks may be formally state-owned, but then the Fed chairman is also formally nominated by the US President. There's a big difference between formal control and real control. And even if the state really does have full sovereign control over its banks (which I doubt), China in all its financial dealings with the outside world is still forced to play by the rules established by international bankers. Also consider the possibility that Jihan is receiving backing from international bankers in addition to Chinese ones.

People's Bank of China digital currency Seminar Held in Beijing
Medium size Source: communication 2016-01-20 19:26:52
January 20, 2016, People's Bank of China digital currency seminar held in Beijing. From the People's Bank, Citibank and Deloitte digital currency expert, respectively, on the overall framework of digital currency currency evolving national digital currency, encryption currency issued by the State and other topics of discussion and exchange.

So-called "Emergent Consensus" is the most idiotic, easily gamed block size increase proposal imaginable. It allows any miner with significant (not even majority!) hashpower to increase the block size at will by mining one oversized block and then three blocks on top of it.

The world isn't standing in place. If Bitcoin fails to develop, innovate and scale then it will be overtaken by a more innovative altcoin.
Many altcoins also have the advantage of being backed by the banking/corporate establishment as centralized alternatives to Bitcoin. Look at Ethereum: **Billions** of dollars have poured into the ETH market in just the past several weeks. Where's that money coming from? From ordinary crypto enthusiasts?
If we just leave things as-is, Wu, Ver and Co. can continue blocking Bitcoin's development indefinitely as altcoins continue to innovate and eventually overtake us. Perhaps this blockage is their true goal, and their threat of a fork is just a bluff.
This is why we urgently need to solve the problem of mining centralization, liquidate the threat of a 51% attack and put Bitcoin's development back in the hands of developers. Only a PoW change can accomplish this; there's simply no other solution.

If Jihan's apparently powerful backers pour lots of money into a BTU pump, we all win simply by holding onto our pre-fork coins. At that point we can exchange all or part of our BTU for BTC, whose value will eventually overtake BTU by virtue of being superior money in every respect: decentralization, security, verifiability, scaling, privacy and fungibility.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:10:21

With a permissive soft fork (if I've understood it correctly) blocks produced by non-upgraded miners will be valid, so mining on top of them is OK.
From the post:


@_date: 2017-03-18 15:28:12
Luke, how about a POW that changes regularly (using a combination of hashing algos, for example) according to some tricky algorithm that can't be predicted in advance (using pseudo-randomness from blockchain headers to make the new POW deterministic but unpredictable).  Thus the POW changes regularly and unpredictably, foiling ASICs, but algorithmically, with no human intervention.

The code is from the function FormatHashBuffers() in [main.cpp]( The file and function were removed from Core several versions ago, and the code on the carpet differs somewhat from that in Core, so this could be a fork, or an altcoin.

Explain to non-technical people that it's the computer equivalent of searching for a needle in a haystack.

In theory, yes, the fittest coin should ultimately survive. But that's in theory. In practice there's a real danger that powerful interests existentially threatened by the very existence of decentralized, permissionless money could collude to kill off the legitimate coin by hijacking the development process, co-opting the community, bribing lawmakers to make the decentralized coin illegal, and so on and so forth. Shrewd investors would foresee this outcome and throw their money into centralized BankerCoin, only accelerating the process of the legitimate, decentralized Bitcoin's destruction. This is why the laissez-faire approach Krawisz advocates is irresponsible.

Average block size for the last 100 blocks is 897,462, so Antpool's shenanigans are hurting transaction throughput by about 10%. Confirmation times have increased to 13:14 over the same period due to Antpool diverting its hashpower to BCH, which makes for another +30% reduction in throughput.

If the value of Bitcoin drops by 50% or more, they'll have to close down shop anyway, because they'll never recover their investment.
I agree that a HF implementation might have been better, but we have a solution that's good enough, if not ideal, and already rolled out. There are no catastrophic flaws in segwit that will come back to bite us in the future. It fixes malleability, which we urgently need. And a future block size increase is also possible, but *after* segwit activates.
Sometimes you have to learn to compromise. The consequences of the miners blocking segwit will be a huge drop in the price, division between the miners and the devs that may never heal, and a possible fork in the chain. All this will be a huge blow to Bitcoin, from which it might not recover.

An empty block propagates faster than a full one by maybe 1 sec.  Given a 10 minute block discovery rate, that's 0.16% faster, or a 0.16% economic advantage on average. But by mining empty blocks Antpool is losing more than 0.5 BTC in fees. With a block reward of 12.5 BTC, that's a 4% loss. In other words, they're taking a 4% loss for the sake of a 0.16% gain. This makes no sense from any perspective.

Mining empty blocks doesn't increase their chance of mining the next block by &gt;4% but only by about 0.16%, assuming a 1 sec. headstart they gain by faster block propagation time. Even if we increase that headstart to  an unrealistically high 10 sec., the win would only be 1.6%.  Still doesn't make sense economically.

Can't argue with the facts you've presented, but the key thing with facts is that they must always be viewed in their historical context. In just a few decades China's achieved an economic level that it took Western countries centuries to attain. Such a forced pace of development has come at a price, of course, resulting in many of the symptoms you've mentioned. More equitable wealth distribution, more openness and a developed civil society: these things take longer, but there are signs that China's moving in this direction as well.

The expired coins could go into a pool, the expiration pool - just a number added to the block header - which would be emptied very gradually (at a rate not exceeding 10% of the current block reward, say). That reduces miner interest in blocking transactions.  Also, if the expiration period were very long, holders could easily move their coins well in advance of the expiration date, even further reducing the likelihood of any tx blockage. Another advantage with early adopters being forced to move their coins to avoid their expiration is that such moving would be viewed as natural and would thus have no negative effect on the market. There are a **lot** of lost coins out there, I'm sure of that. By putting those lost coins back into circulation, we enforce the sanctity of the 21 million money supply, which only strengthens Bitcoin, in my view.

Why? There's nothing in segwit that makes a block size increase in the future more difficult. Segwit already *effectively* increases the block size by 2x or more by moving the signatures out of the blocks, so it will actually double the benefits of any future blocksize increase.
The core devs' position is that we should first focus on layer 2 solutions like Lightning, which scales Bitcoin not by 2x or 4x but by roughly *200x*, and only then consider a block size increase if necessary. It's a perfectly logical position. Layer 2 is the *only* way to to scale Bitcoin to the level of Visa or Mastercard. It will never happen on layer 1.
Regarding your network load statistics, that's just total disinformation. Someone's misled you, apparently. Segwit places no additional load on the network at all.

Short-sighted thinking on the part of the miners. Especially if you consider that when it activates, *all* miners would lose fee revenue equally, which leaves no one at a competitive disadvantage.
A rising Bitcoin price is far more important for miners than a paltry couple percent of fee revenue lost. And the price will rise faster if segwit is adopted and Bitcoin's development moves forward.

If your node cost $50 or $500 a month to run, would you still run it? In addition to a serious up-front capital investment, because consumer-grade hardware won't be able to process 10MB blocks, much less 100 MB ones.

Do you run a full node?
Mine's running on a fairly
modern (5-yr-old) computer
with a reliable, high-speed Internet connection.
If it's been offline for 10 days or so
it already takes me several hours to resync

and that's with the current 1MB block limit.
At 8MB, that's *megabytes*, I'll probably give up on
running a full node altogether,
as it will be too much of a hassle.
Bitcoin XT implements a gradual blocksize increase
to 8GB, that's *gigabytes*,
which will
make it impossible for any ordinary PC to
even conceivably run a full node.
The result will be extreme centralization
and the death of Bitcoin as a distributed,
untrusted, peer-to-peer network,
which means the end of Bitcoin, period.

Are there really? One company, Bitmain, produces 70% of all Bitcoin mining ASICs. This gives Bitmain direct or indirect control over 70% of the hashing power. For example, it can refuse to sell hardware to those mining operations whose policies it doesn't like and blackmail existing customers into supporting its policies.


If Bitmain is being backed by state or transnational actors whose goal is to control or destroy Bitcoin, then the lower the value of BTC the better, from its perspective.


The present situation isn't good for mining revenues **even from a short-term perspective.** If not for the blockage of Segwit and the uncertainty created by Bitmain's threat of a hard fork, Bitcoin would be easily be trading today above its recent high of $1340.

We keep hearing this specious argument over and over again. Miner profitability is dependent above all on **the value of Bitcoin,** not miner fees. By holding Bitcoin development hostage, miners are making Bitcoin less valuable and harming their own profits. Therefore it's clear that the motives of Segwit-blocking miners are **political, not economic.** In other words, they're trying either to take Bitcoin over or to destroy it.

To non-upgraded wallets, Segwit transactions look like valid, anyone-can-spend transactions. This was necessary to make Segwit backwards-compatible. It has no effect on the security of the system, because after Segwit activation blocks must obey the Segwit consensus rules.
However, Segwit opponents use this protocol detail to frighten people, claiming that they'll lose their coins if they upgrade. Strangely enough, not a single satoshi has been stolen from a Segwit transaction to this day, though Segwit activated back in August.

The 2x increase doesn't solve Bitcoin's scaling issues. A few months after the fork, blocks will be full again, and the 2x crowd will be clamoring for yet another blocksize increase. Forcing a HF against the will of most of the devs and community for the sake of a change in the protocol that gives us essentially nothing is folly at best, and malice at worst.
Bitcoin will scale in other, much more effective, ways, such as sidechains and Lightning -- both of which are purely opt-in and don't require forks in the protocol. And if you don't like Blockstream's implementation of Lightning, there's absolutely nothing to stop you from coming up with one of your own.

Thanks for the heads up.  I thought I'd be getting connections right away.  However, my node should be trying itself to connect to other onion nodes, shouldn't it?  Nothing's happening.

The only nodes that matter here are mining nodes.  Even if 100% of non-mining nodes don't upgrade, this is not a problem.  Any invalid TXs these unupgraded nodes might produce will be rejected by the miners and never get into a block.

@_date: 2016-10-22 18:23:35
You're right, it would be a HF in that case and be rejected by the unupgraded nodes.  So it looks like this is indeed a vulnerability. I guess the devs are counting on not only miners but the majority of key non-mining nodes being upgraded by the time segwit activates.
Also bear in mind that no one's forcing you to use segwit, even after activation.  If you don't trust it, don't use it, and your funds won't be vulnerable to the attack you've hypothesized.

The HF is a political concession to the powerful mining interests who are currently blocking Segwit. It has no technical merit but is necessary to get them to stop their obstruction. That's why some of us reluctantly support it.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:10:53
OK, I see what you're getting at.


Actually,  51% attackers even today could not only steal bitcoins but make whatever changes in the protocol they want, say, making the entire UTXO set spendable only by themselves.
And as soon as they did that, their chain would become worthless.  Yes, it would cause a disruption for a short time, but honest miners would continue mining, and their chain would eventually be recognized as the true one.
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:46:55
Non-upgraded wallets that use addresses beginning with '1' are entirely unaffected by segwit.  They can receive and spend payments as before.
Non-upgraded non-mining nodes can also keep running.  They won't even notice anything's changed.  Soft fork means backwards compatible.

NY2X is a power play, an attempt by the banking/corporate establishment to take control of Bitcoin's development. And we all know what the end result will be: a privatized blockchain in which Bitcoin's core principles of decentralization, trustlessness, permissionlessness and fungibility are thrown out the window.
The silly little 2x block size increase is a red herring, an attempt by the authors of this power grab to paint themselves as reasonable and conciliatory and those who oppose it as hardheaded and unreasonable. Doubling the block size does effectively nothing to address Bitcoin's scalability issues, as Bitcoin needs **orders-of-magnitude scaling** to become a global payment system, **scaling which only layer-2 solutions can provide.**
The 2x HF is a solution that solves nothing, and the fact that the NYA signees are willing to risk major disruption in the markets and community for its sake is proof of their ill intent, or maybe just plain stupidity.

And finally, why the secrecy? Why didn't the participants publish their agreement immediately and make it available for public discussion?

Redeploying BIP 141 and rejecting BIP 91 are completely unnecessary if all you want to do is schedule a 2MB HF. All this is is just an attempt to throw the core devs under the bus and create a new "corporate-friendly" development team.

I guess I'm not getting how 78% support for Silbert's compromise solution translates into 78% support for UASF. Isn't this a leap of logic?
I say if Barry's proposal really has that degree of support, then let's do it. We need to get Segwit activated, and UASF poses an unacceptably high risk of a chain split.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:31:09
The whole point is that *it doesn't matter* even if the vast majority of non-mining nodes don't upgrade, as long as some do.  A minority of validating nodes will be sufficient.

UASF could very easily lead to a chain split with a crippling attack on the minority (i.e. real Bitcoin) chain.  Do we need that? The compromise solution avoids that risk.

The author seems unaware that segwit is already fully implemented in Core and up and running on testnet.

Actually, you should be citing Eth Classic here as a positive example, not a negative one. It arose because the principled part of the Ethereum community (which turned out to be in the minority) refused to go along with a HF and essentially roll back the Ethereum blockchain. If our refusal to go along with the Segwit2x HF leads to a chain split, we'll be in a much better position than ETC because we'll have the best developers and the majority of the community on our side.

The question of whether Bitcoin was created by an individual or group of anti-establishment cypherpunks or by the establishment itself is almost a moot one, because Bitcoin is defined by its core principles and the laws of mathematics, not by whomever created it.
A strong, educated community has grown up around Bitcoin that understands the way it functions and is committed to its ideology of decentralization, permissionlessness and trustlessness. This community is successfully fending off attempts to attack or co-opt Bitcoin.
However, to continue defeating such attempts in the future, the community must grow and continue to increase its understanding of the technical aspects of Bitcoin as well as the methods of political and informational manipulation being used against it.
Attempts to marginalize the Bitcoin community, replace it with an ersatz one, pressure and threaten key community members or promote compromised figures and "useful idiots" into positions of leadership will only increase. Overly rapid adoption by millions of easily manipulated users with little understanding of Bitcoin, either technical or political, increases the risk that such attempts will succeed. This is why the core community's growth and cohesiveness must keep pace with adoption.
In addition, the community must diversify and secure its channels of communication. Reliance on corporate-controlled social media such as Reddit and Twitter could prove to be an Achilles heel; alternatives to them need to be found, preferably end-to-end encrypted and peer-to-peer ones.

First of all, the 2MB HF comes only later. The point is that this solution is acceptable to the people who control the majority hash rate and are currently blocking Segwit. It allows us to get Segwit implemented now without risking a chain split as in the case of UASF. The hard fork is trivial to implement and involves very little risk with miner and community consensus. This solution is a *compromise.* Compromises are always ugly, but the cost of not making needed compromises can be even uglier.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:19:34


In the long run, they probably do.  But if Barry Silbert's claims are correct, they're willing to compromise for now and activate Segwit if we meet their demands for a 2MB block size increase. Whatever their intentions are, the offer is worth considering.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:18:52

The author outlines the following scenario:








Regarding point 3:  UASF nodes will choose the longest chain.  They don't care who was or wasn't signaling on bit 1 prior to August 1.  But since no one is likely to be signaling on bit 1 on the longest chain according to this scenario, then UASF nodes will just reject every block they encounter, leading the UASF network to essentially grind to a halt.
The only way out of this situation I can see would be a coordinated use of the `invalidateblock` RPC call.

This is incorrect. There are no Segwit blocks yet, only Segwit-**signaling** blocks. Segwit signaling is just a number in the block header and has no effect on the block itself. The reason block sizes have dropped is that people are wary of transacting at the moment due to the risk of reorgs and chain splits.

The numbers are going up.  As of block 476813, **53** of the last 100 and **35** of the last 50 blocks are actually signaling on bit 1. So non-signalers risk finding themselves on the minority chain at block 477120 in the event of a split.
BIP91 activation (block 477120) should occur around 06:00 UTC Sunday given our current block discovery rate.

One of the ways they're manipulating people is by promoting the false narrative of "infighting within the community", the very narrative that you're promoting in your post, whether wittingly or unwittingly.
The fallacy that there are always "two sides to every debate" is a trap that people often fall into. Often the "other side" is a purely manufactured one, as in the case of the so-called blocksize debate.

I do.  Someone could still try to slip a subtle exploit by the devs, though, especially in a large patch.  There's no harm in trying, as they say.  Suspicious bugs make their way into open-source projects all the time (recall Heartbleed, Shellshocked) and can remain undetected for shockingly long periods.

The current fee for a transaction with one input and two outputs in three confirmations is around 15 cents. How large was that transaction (in bytes)?  Seems like Roger "forgot" to mention its enormous size to you, or the fact that it might have had unconfirmed inputs.
As to the problems with non-confirming transactions, those are caused by broken wallets that don't support dynamic transaction fees.  If wallet providers refuse to fix their software, that's their problem (and the problem of the customers that use them), not a problem with Bitcoin Core.

Regarding point 4: What's to stop the legacy chain miners from doing a trivial HF to prevent the risk of a reorg?  All they'd have to do is declare the first UASF block invalid.

Sidechains have the same scaling limitations as the Bitcoin main chain. However, they could perhaps tolerate a higher degree of centralization (and thus a larger block size), being backed by the more decentralized main chain.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:34:54
Bitcoin isn't ripping itself apart. Hostile entities are ripping it apart, or trying to at least. That's a crucial difference. But Bitcoin will survive and prevail because of its ethos, its community and its developers. Bitcoin will **never** compromise on its core principles of decentralization, immutability and open development.

One possible reason:  Roger desperately needs for the value of his Bitcoin holdings to rise quickly (maybe he has large debts?).  So he's counting on the short-term rise in price that a blocksize increase could bring.

You'll have coins on both chains, so you'll have to run two clients with two separate blockchains. Make sure to make a copy of the blockchain before August 1st.
