Here is an in depth description

make a linux live cd and remove your bitcoin from mt gox if your really worried. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:26:35
I'd bet this is true and well deserved.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:59:16
I dont trade or open any bitcoin accounts with this computer thankfully. 
Edit: nor do I deal with MTGOX
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:32:10
 
works nicely because it shows the price in the tab on chrome
Only shows bitstamp though. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:07:47
how do I do that?
I've disabled it in chrome 
Where can the no script plugin be found?
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:43:45
This is BAD SITE DO NOT VISIT.
They try to steal your bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:16:30
HAHA its already back up to 74$
@_date: 2013-04-20 06:15:16
Use CGminer 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:44:26
Then how come mt.gox cant keep up with the people throwing their money into bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:17:42
And just so you know, this is because bots are dragging the price down.
look at the transactions..
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:11:51
The skynet botnet guy probably.
And I think they do it just to make money, it does also lag the system though. 
The bots buy and sell but make fractions on these transactions because they can do so many so fast.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:47:25
The link didnt actually work, will they actually come try to find me?
I feel theres allot of misinformation about tor and .onion sites.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:04:39
I've been noticing more bots on virtexCAD exchange.
And they get prices people aren't offering. I was there trying to get 100$ per BTC and bots were getting 109 somehow. 
Bot would get 109 at .001 BTC and regular seller would get like 98 for 12.67 BTC..
I think the Bots are there to drive the price either up or down depending!
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:44:40
Wish I got tipped 10k for putting up that link yesterday!
but no I actually got downvoted..
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:49:37
Here's a good video that explains everything in 5 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:06:09
I transferred .93 BTC to my libertybit account and when I tried to withdraw it, they said I only had access to .0002 of my account balance.
Why is this, am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:06:27
So at what point should amazing innovation be rewarded?
Bitcoin is a network protocol, maybe bitcoins will fail. 
Bitcoin however will change the economic system. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:28:21
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:27:31
Cashed out my investment last big drop, sold at 215.
so either way I'm not loosing anything and its been pretty stable at 100
But I sold at 98 knowing it would go down monday, now I'll just increase my bitcoin count.
If you think bitcoin is going to fade away your a dumbass, look at all the recent media attention. 
Fuel for the fire my friend..
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:09:02
I suspect there is some market manipulation going on, it would be very easy if you had a botnet or even as stated in that article a large number of bitcoins and more then one account.
Wonder how many accounts the winklevoss twins have.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:23:46
So a private key is the actual bitcoin Id?
I thought that was to do with an online/offline wallet. 
Private keys being like a password and public being like an account number for your wallet. 
To confirm a bitcoin is real they must have some way of identifying each individual one. Isnt the reason it takes time to process a transaction because that transaction is being "confirmed by the network"?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:11:01
clicked on the link without seeing the .onion 
ARE THE FEDS ON THEIR WAY!?
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:45:59
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:53:24
I clicked on that link and it didnt seem like anything that interesting. 
Why is it a dangerous link?
Should I be worried?
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:41
satoshi nakamoto is the man/woman who wrote the bitcoin code with a team of hand picked individuals.
The identity is not known at this time and might not ever be. 
The source for the code has been open the whole time though, so its not like they can pull the plug whenever. 
there are videos on youtube that go through all of this, it would take me far to long to explain it.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:20:10
The reason bitcoin is such a great idea is because as it stands right now Visa, Mastercard, Amex, paypal etc.. has to provide a secure online network for the transaction records to be checked, stored and referenced. A "digital ledger"
the problem is they have a cost associated with providing a service like this. Bitcoin miners are doing this with their mining rigs, so there is little or no overhead cost associated with transactions. 
They take 3% usually, bitcoin takes a fraction of 1% if any at all.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:57:54
I thought the framework of the bitcoin network was to reference every bitcoin mined and confirm it's legit. 
So wouldnt, they be able to cross reference those "confirmed bitcoins"?
I was under the impression every bitcoin had a unique key which was confirmed a specific number of times then cleared as "real."
People say to mine bitcoin your computer completes a complex math problem which inturn rewards you with a "block". I thought this was just an easy way of explaining it. When in reality miners are the bitcoin network for processing transactions and confirming ID's. 
That would be an obvious reason for the increased difficulty as more bitcoin are mined, more transactions and confirmations.
Look at visa for example, they have a network of machines confirming each transaction and keeping track of where each charge was processed. 
A network is needed to keep track of everything, so the users of bitcoin provide said network. Meanwhile visa has to pay for this network, so they charge more in transaction fees.

Damn, was thinking the anti script addon was on chrome. 
Uninstalled java from my computer, and I dont use mt gox or this computer to trade on. Can they still get me?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:00:34
That price is based on the last transaction, which was over 35 minutes ago.
Its just not as popular.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:24:02
Could be, it would be very easy if you had some bitcoin to throw around. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:57:43
Cant say who it is but that article explains why.
probably the skynet botnet guy.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:46:26
yes depending on the service you use, Bitpay offers instant transactions at .99% and you usually get the funds in your account by the next day.
So its not only faster but also cheaper, and as time goes on I'm sure they'll be more services.
