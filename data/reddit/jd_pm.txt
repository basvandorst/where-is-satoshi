‪Couldn’t have asked for a clearer example of the efficacy word of mouth marketing. This thanksgiving - lots of  chatter, led to a reported 100k US Coinbase signups on the day. Adoption curve is slowly moving from the innovators to early adopters. Imagine this again at XMAS!‬

Coinbase needs to grab a share of the total money available. 2% of institutional investments, pensions and high net worth people and companies hedging their bets in crypto will need an entry point and Coinbase is best placed to see this happen. Decentralisation may not be the best method at this part because the big money may need to feel secure and safe investing OPM in crypto and need to be able to hold someone accountable if it falls to pieces.

You lost me. Coinbase can't be trusted to develop that tech?..Toshi?!

Think of value in 3 ways:
1/ monetary value - Cryptocurrencies 
2/ security value - crypto asset, as a share of profits 
3/ utility value - utility tokens like ether, 0x where their value increases with network effects. 
Cryptocurrencies are the wrong term for blockchain digital assets. I’d prefer cryptoassets of which they will fall into one of the three buckets above. 
Bitcoin’s protocol is in place to power it’s currency (e.g. payments network and store of value), whereas Ethereum’s currency is used to power the protocol (e.g. ETH being the gas needed to build dapps on top of so they can leverage its blockchain EVM). 
Chris Burniske has an unreleased book on this subject called Cryptoassets - available on Amazon on 20 Oct.

Time will tell. I'm not here to speak for the future. We as humans tend to do a bad job at predictions. I'm just stating what their current focus is as a company. How well it works is entirely down to them not me so it could very well go south, but anyone in crypto is likely an optimist to be in this space so early.

I’m with you on this buddy. It would remove the need for many pointless and costly checks such as employer references, criminal background checks, and proof of right to work in a given country. 
Would love to hear more.

FCA themselves are concerned by the bank’s actions. That says a lot.

This transition may take longer than you think. Look how long Facebook took to reach 1 third of the general population.

How did you get this. Is it heat map of bitcoin google searches?

To clarify: 
1/ Coinbase offers a ewallet - Coinbase.com and Coinbase app. Both have high fees but easier to use
2/ Coinbase offers a trading platform called GDAX. Very low fees, margin trading, can login with your Coinbase account but harder to use for the inexperienced or non-traders.

Thanks for sharing your perspective. I’m in alignment here but I think the timelines are optimistic. It’s going to take a good decade or more for the money to move over in a meaningful way and still at that point be maybe 10/15% of total Global GDP in crypto. 
In the interim, people’s money in AUM funds will dip their toes in crypto but there own money in the bank will take years of education, innovation, security simplicity without loss of efficacy and ease of use for world wide adoption. 
Coinbase will do well but it’s not as simple as Coinbase then no more fiat - it will take decades to achieve this. 
Remember US is way further ahead in crypto knowledge than other parts like the U.K. where it’s still early days.
