It's almost as if it's wildly unstable.

Yes that's how bubbles tend to work: unsustainable growth.

It's looking like dumping it at 20k would have been pretty smart.

It can't be that far away given that we have functional prototypes.

But the achievement is far greater if they're at the point where most people wouldn't have even begun to develop those kinds of skills.

Yes but we're talking about how impressed we should be.

That was seriously a good point.
"The Usenet, a worldwide bulletin board, allows anyone to post messages across the nation. Your word gets out, leapfrogging editors and publishers. Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly. The result? Every voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen."
This is the entire modern news cycle as driven by social media. Politicians don't have to account for their mistakes any more, they just put their head down and wait for the next tide of commentary to drown out whatever they're ashamed of.
And his comment about meeting for coffee. I don't think anyone sensible would argue that there in'ts far too much superficial interaction online. People with a friendslist of hundreds and no one to actually go and hang out with.

That seems a little mean-spirited to me. You don't think a teenager achieving a thing (whatever the thing is) that is normally only achieved by much older, more experienced people is impressive/worth noting?
Like, to take it to an extreme, I presume you would find a three year-old coding their own game to be impressive?
