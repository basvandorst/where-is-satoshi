Were they here the last 4 years that the exact same thing happened in January, plus all the other times the price dropped significantly and crypto was "dead"?

Good point. But can you eat honey or silver?
This actually reminds me of a shower thought I had the other day. The majority of the price of silver and gold is speculative in terms of a currency, and not for the demand for practical uses. Therefore, if we can abandon precious metals as a store of value by using cryptocurrency, it would actually benefit humanity by allowing them to be used practically instead of sitting around as bars in some vault with someone convinced that their shiny rocks are worth some ridiculous amount.

Dimon is my bubble barometer, and the day I see him hit 5 in the stages of grief is when I'll be taking some profits (and buying in again after the presumed pop)
I'm actually surprised he has progressed this quickly though, makes me a little nervous....

Meh. Im not musing about not having emotion or sociology. Instead I'm wondering about changing our perspective on it, where we might get more emotional satisfaction and place more of that kind of value in more interpersonal things that can't be bought and sold. Beep boop bop. I mean. Not robot. Error.

Why should I care about whether someone thinks I'm wealthy though? I'd say that's still speculative based on emotional/sociological value
I guess I was thinking along the lines of practical pragmatic use. For example for electrical contacts or surface conduction. Would we be able to develop better technology at a more efficient cost if we could divorce the emotional/sociological inflation of the price?
Someone else interestingly pointed out that most of the price of silver is driven by practical industrial use, so it would be impacted less with that sociological shift.

Your money is always in the game. Even in you buy back into fiat its value is inflating away and fluctuating with the world economy. Even if you spend it on physical things, those things have value and are appreciating/depreciating. Even if you buy experiences with it, you continue paying opportunity costs on not owning an asset anymore. 
It's up to you to decide what's the right moves in the game, but don't fool yourself into thinking that just cause you own fiat you're not playing anymore ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:23:40
it's not trust of the miners unless they actually gained control, at which point, yes. That currency will be centralized and worthless because it requires trust. 
There is no trust of the programmers, it is open source, free to be reviewed and modified by anybody. You are not required to trust.
The rest of the stuff you went beyond the scope of definition for a trustless system. I guess yes, I also have to trust that people want to use a better currency, and also that an asteroid doesn't come down and obliterate half the planet. It's getting beyond what cryptocurrency is supposed to fix, and pointing out problems that exist both with fiat and crypto...
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:29:34
good luck shutting it down by force. It will cost an unacceptable amount of taxpayer money to destroy one. And then a new one will pop up in its place. It is hopeless and there's no rational reason to do it. The failed war on drugs would be child's play compared to a war on crypto.
The best you can do is try to convince people that it's too dangerous to be involved with it. Which is what people are trying to do right now. So far it isn't working.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:42
right, the play paper money that looks kind of like the ones in the monopoly set. What were those shitcoins called again?
Also, "the first indication"? Seriously? mainstream public has been saying "it's play money," "it's a ponzi scheme" for years, and are slowly being convinced that it can be at least as "real" as fiat currency. You've got it backwards
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:48:14
So it's valued on the global scale because the US economy uses it. And the US uses it because they have to. So it follows that the only reason it has value anywhere is because the US government says it does, and until the birth of cryptocurrency we had no choice but to listen to their authority.
Now we have a choice. We can choose to not use the fiat currencies that the government creates debt with and inflates that debt away at the holders' expense. Maybe you think that everyone will still want to use that money, and that's a valid opinion. But I'm inclined to believe that the global market will react to move away from government control of currency.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:59:58
It's also more likely to be a ponzi if it's issued by a corporation with centralized control. You have to then TRUST the entity issuing your coins. 
The whole point of the cryptocurrency movement is that you do not have to trust any person in the system. Only that anyone colluding to undermine it does not exceed the majority and gain control of the consensus. Nobody owns it. Nobody is at the top to collect.
Fiat is monarchy, it's the totalitarianism of money. Cryptocurrency is the democracy of money; owned and controlled by the people. But just as with government, because everyone has only known monarchy, they have trouble imagining how democracy could possibly work. The authority has always known best.

How is it literally backed by the US economy? Am I legally entitled to anything if I want to turn them back in to the government? Am I guaranteed some portion of the government's land or our nation's resources? No. It's not backed by anything other than that people accept it because they think they have no choice.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:36:59
Blockchain without (at least some) decentralization is a boring and trivial technology that has literally zero value proposition. The whole point of this thing is the trustless, permissionless transfer of value.
Centralized solutions require you to rely on trust of the central parties. So if the government issues a completely centralized "cryptocurrency" all the same pieces of the financial apparatus are still needed. Nothing improves there. Now what, they just store the transactions in a blockchain? A blockchain is just a ledger sectioned up into blocks. It's worthless on its own.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:33:13
Since you're here talking about it that's a good thing. Keep up the ability to talk about it, even if it's with one of those hotlines. Seriously, one of my friends called one way back when and later that day he told me about it. He said it saved his life.
It wasn't an easy road for him to find his way out of that dark place, but he's glad he made it back from the deepest depths of it. Seriously wishing good health for you.

"This behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when **many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren’t keeping pace with inflation, there aren’t many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person.** Many Bitcoin buyers aren’t bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10"
This stood out to me in the article (emphasis mine). It's what ultimately got me to put money in. Sure it's risky, but I'm guaranteed to lose playing the "safe" game. At least with crypto I have a hail mary play using my disposable income.

Well, I'd argue the real use for IOTA just isn't here yet (m2m economy), and the use for p2p payments doesn't fully work without a functioning m2m economy to support the tangle. It's all quite a ways off. Either of those other coins could be the more near-term p2p solution. Time will tell I suppose

It's more secure because it protects you from: Coinbase going down when you need your coins immediately. Coinbase going dark and never giving you your coins. Hackers accessing your account or otherwise obtaining the Coinbase keys to your wallet.
A hardware wallet is another good option for keeping access to your wallet away from hackers

Also, is this any surprise to anybody? Once you were required to attach your verified identity to your account, how would you think the government wouldn't find your money?

None of the posts I have seen have made me overly wary. 
However it's always a good idea to move your coins onto your own cold wallet, which is the only way to guarantee that you actually own your coins.

Although it says "transaction type" over a calendar year, so if you made e.g. 20 buys and 20 sells at $1000 average, or transfered money into and out of your coinbase account, you'd have your records turned over

But the oldest and thus ostensibly wisest guy in the room says he's used USD for his entire life, so therefore there can't be any value in using crypto except for terrorists and tax evaders. So there you have it. Checkmate crypto.

A "cryptocurrency" with a single centralized issuer is of no interest to me. It's just digital fiat. And this one is from one of the least reputable issuers of fiat.
Not to mention it's real purpose is to try to get money into a failing dictatorship around international sanctions.
Either way, whoever wants to own Petro, go ahead. I'll lose no sleep.

Not what I'm suggesting. Just saying that it being "oil-backed" is a farce. And it's as worthless at the Venezuelan Bolivar.

Do some more research about how cryptocurrencies function in general. It will benefit you greatly for sorting the gold from the shit, and stay safer overall.
But the short answer is that the Etherium network manages the balances held in the addresses. As long as you have the key to that address you can access the funds at that address. No centralized authority has control. You either have the key, or you don't. There is no workaround.
A wallet client is the software to interact with the Eth network. It will use the private key to access an address to send.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:23:11
If it's "backed by oil" it can't be controlled decentrally. So at best it could have a "fixed" supply. But that's subject to the whims of whoever is in control. Since it's the Venezuelan government in control: No. It's not fixed supply, and I also doubt you'll get whatever oil it "guarantees" if you tried to cash it in.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:12:28
But normally a user would be avoiding governmental controls to their own benefit. In this case, it's only to benefit the coin's creator.
Sort of like how plenty of cryptos have been created to orchestrate ponzi schemes and other scams with the hopes of being able to avoid regulators and law enforcement.

That's assuming that there isn't a wallet seed saved somewhere in the keypass file. If you have that, you could regenerate a wallet without finding the wallet file.
The method for recovery could be different depending on what information you have in the keypass file. Generally I'd advise not to feel like you're in a rush. Take the time to learn what wallet seeds/passwords would look like, and how to do these recoveries yourself. Don't let anyone convince you that they need to do it for you before you understand how it works.

Then the free market will self regulate the self regulators by having a private entity that rates the original private self rating orgs. This will happen ad infinitum until everything is self regulated with no reasonable path for corruption because they will all be driven by private profits which will definitely be maximized by strictly following consumer interests.
