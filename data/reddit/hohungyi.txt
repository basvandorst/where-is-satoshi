Give him up? Let him down? Turn around and desert him?

Is there a backstory to this? Both ministers FUDed then bought the dip?
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:32:55
What is cryptocurrency without a distributed blockchain? Centralized solutions are just traditional banks in sheeps clothing.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:20
Satoshi Nakamoto = SN... turn it around it becomes NS... NS = Nick Szabo. BOOM.
Please send Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:33:55
We shouldn’t, because then RV will call it mini Bitcoin or something. /s

Username checks out!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:37:13
Please do own googling, I don’t want to add to FUD here.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:11
Please don’t call it core. It’s Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:46:12
Okay then.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:03:54
Plot twist those keys contain 1,000,000 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:10:46
Haha sick burn!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:52:51
Help me understand why it would take the price down to 16400?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:38:46
Because there are already a lot of people who know. I’m asking them if this should be a cause of concern. If you don’t already know, then either stay ignorant or go read up.

Sold some btc when it was 15k! Got lucky there.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:34:58
I’m fighting the coming zombie apocalypse with this!
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:32:03
Truly magnificent beasts!
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:55:37
Sold some btc when it was at 15k, then waited for the right car to come along..
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:33:16
Sold at the last bull run, then waited for the right drive to come along. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:36:35
Not looking forward to the new defender too man. All the news leaking about it is just awful. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:46:25
To each his own, I’m going to go explore the world now. :)
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:57:04
I’m going to try to turn this electric.......... hahahahaha
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:58:13
It never was, are you kidding me?
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:50:43
Started mining with slush pool about 7-8 years back when a friend told me about bitcoin, and I thought: “Sweet! Free coins, no idea what they’re good for but heck I’ll leave my 3d modeling/rendering desktop setup on 24/7 to “mine” some silly internet coins.”
Forgot about it for a few years, then btc started creeping into my news radar again, and holy shit the price, so I bought a few more.
Bitcoin reached 1k, now I’m getting invested, so I bought a few more. 
3k, bought a few more, 7k bought a few more, 9k bought a few more. Always to hardware wallet.
Then I sold some at 15k, cashed out my recent capital and then some. 
A year later spotted this sweet ride for sale, so I thought why the hell not?
Just got lucky I guess!
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:57:52
About 4btc haha.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:03:00
This is the Internet, there’s no need for “proof” pfft.
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:58:37
Still do! I’m still invested in a btc future.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:01:19
A good number of Defenders are hitting the 25 year old mark, making it eligible for classic vehicle import which greatly reduces the paper work for getting one into the US, you should keep an eye out for one!
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:29:59
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:59:34
Land Rover Defender 2012!
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:04:16
When the end of the world comes, I only need my Defender and Bitcoin to survive.
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:53:26
Nope ;P
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:30:57
You’re just gonna but btc and bring them to your grave?
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:56:22
I was curious about that too, thanks for doing the research!
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:27:59
Already on it!
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:25:04
Never shorted btc, never short btc. I longed btc, 7 years long.
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:33:38
All I’m saying is, between the Lambo and the Land Rover, I made the environmentally conscious choice. ��
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:52:35
My wife’s pretty satisfied so I have nothing else to prove with it. There are other choices sure but I’ve always wanted this.
@_date: 2019-03-09 11:54:18
Yours would be a Td5? Or Tdi? Fantastic engines those!
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:53:36
Sorry I don’t work in the crypto space, just a lucky guy. Hope you find what you need buddy.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:26:12
Here’s an upvote.

When btc moon again??
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:51:40
Well, I didn’t sell all my btc.......
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:44:47
Not everything in life is about accumulating wealth, my friend. I’m looking forward to using this purchase to drive around the world, meeting new people and accumulating new experiences. 
It may look like a dumb purchase to you, but I value this more than how much value btc is able to build over the next few years.
In other words, I reached my moon.
@_date: 2019-03-09 13:29:53
Yes it’s a depreciating asset but the value I’m going to get out of it is immeasurable! Going to enjoy my life while waiting for btc to moon again.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:12:38
Nope not China!
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:38:24
Apologies for being out of the loop, but what’s up with the Australian joker and how did he get in this mess?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:11:22
Still not your Bitcoin until you move it out of the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:46:18
Wait Lamborghini’s taking Bitcoin now?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:51:22
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:08:04
Yes relatively and yes I get your point. Was a miner a couple years back then stopped, now back in the game and trying to catch up.
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:37:44
He gave extra, it’s like buy 10 get 10 free plus one bonus.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:45:43
Ironically I’ve never met a drug dealer who said: “I’ll take Bitcoin.”
Not that I’ve met a drug dealer or anything.. quoting a friend.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:48:37
Don’t HODL, BUY
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:59:42
Yes cue.. FML english failed.
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:14:00
May I interest you in a satoshi?
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:53:23
I kind of have the sense Bitcoin is anti-fragile at this moment because people who buy into Bitcoin now are people who know what Bitcoin really is. 
When “the majority” comes in and start buying without having the appropriate background or knowledge of things another attack could spell problems. 
What we need to do now is to educate and spread the word so new people continue to believe in Bitcoin for what it really is, not what they think it is.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:54:08
You only think gold is valuable because you and everybody around you think and believe it’s valuable. The same can be said for bitcoin or any currency fiat or crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:59:38
Side question too: 12 English words seem too general, what are the chances of somebody randomly keying in 12 words into the system and getting into somebody else’s wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:30:39
No more moon, now BLACKHOEL.
Edit: BLACKHODL I’m a moron.

@_date: 2018-03-04 05:26:21
Very nicely designed app! Any chance it can have an Apple Watch integration soon as well?
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:08:56
1btc is worth exactly 1btc. We need to stop thinking in terms of fiat.
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:35:56
If you do, remember to take it off the exchange immediately if you value your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:03:47
What volatility?
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:10:47
Money is power.
Power is money.
Hence, free power is free money.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:09:20
Why would you compare Netscape to Bitcoin? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:33:59
Pretty sure his face is kinda round..
