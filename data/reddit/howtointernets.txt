That's sad.

What happened here?

Yeah dude honestly your attitude is shit. Put your ego aside and realize that people who use bitcoin are less than 1% of the global population and less than 1% of that group include people who are 'experts of bitcoin' (you know, the ones that would make you look ignorant). 
So let's stop pretending this guy deserves to be given shit when he used the service in the exact way it was intended and it failed, okay?

Basic economic theory would say that if demand were to stay the same (people still want to buy the same amount of BTC),  and the  supply goes down because the coins are for all intents and purposes gone forever, the price of bitcoin must go up. That is what Satoshi was likely talking about. 
The reason for price going down is related to supply being greater than demand. 
If a major bank failed and took everyone's money away (let's pretend that the government doesn't insure people's money), other people at other banks may be worried that the same will happen to them. That leads to panic selling which can crash a market quite quickly.

Thanks for pointing that out.

It's more to do with the fact that many people lose faith in bitcoin after they are affected by a security breach.

Right,  but that wasn't an exploit of the financial system itself.  I should have been more specific.  I guess what I'ml wondering is if there's a possibility that something could completely destroy Bitcoin,  such as someone instantaneously mining all the remaining blocks,  counterfeiting,  or someone taking control of all Bitcoin in existence.

This was a great post,  thanks! 
But it sort of highlights my concerns... If a 'safe'  system has encounted a number of exploits over the last 3 years,  that trend can certainly continue.  
I'm also hoping to get some responses from individuals that understand the complete architecture of how the Bitcoin protocols work.

Maybe I'm missing something, but why not INCENTIVIZE people to abstain from adblockers? Why don't they pay us for each ad we view to avoid using ad block?
It says companies lost $22 billion last year. I'm sure they would have rather lost $10 billion and pay out $5 billion... (just throwing numbers out there)

Another great interview! Thanks Unikrn!

I agree entirely. And I'd bet a mathematician such as Craig W could even remember such a long number.  
But he would be a fool to use it. Using it would be an obvious breach of the contract. And what does he stand to gain by using it? What does he stand to lose?
There are reasons that the identity or identities of Satoshi Nakamoto have not been released.

Looks like you've done quite well based on your stats if you've only used the bot.
