That's right. It's so strange that we have 1000 toothpastes and up until now, 1 money. It's almost comical when you think about it.

It's strange sometimes feeling like you have a crystal ball. Makes me think of William Gibson "(knowledge about the) future is here, it's just not evenly distributed!" Thx for subscribe!

well im the same way (dont watch trailers) and i still dont think this effects anything even a little... i think if and when you see it you'll realize it's just a little easter egg easily missed that has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot... it's like seeing the mic boom pole come into the frame or something!
respect to you tho i hear you :)

just so you know, it only appears for about .5 seconds! it's an easter egg! it's not the plot :)
also i thought BTC enthusiasts were supposed to be ahead of the curve and have watched these things already ;)
