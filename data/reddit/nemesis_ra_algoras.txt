You wonder why Binance/Okex/Huobi volume has been consistently top 3 when the entire market is down? This guy knows it!

Blockchain is still in its early stage as a very promising technology.  It will not be a good idea to scare off the majority.  If the majority loses confidence, how long will it take the market to recover?  The price depends heavily on the mood towards the market.
Wall Street Tom Lee has been bullish on bitcoin, and they have been buying since, late December?
That being said, there is still the 5k support to watch.  I'm not selling a single coin contributing to the downtrend.

If OKEx's volume turns out among the top in the next few days(like on Feb 5th), we can be sure it's some greedy Chinese whales in action spreading fake FUD again.  They got caught this time:
No one should give a fuck about China.

Isn't 7800 support the 200-day moving average that institutional investors should be looking at?

After Sep 4 2017, OKcoin moved to Hongkong and turned into OKex.
Changpeng Zhao and Yi He used to work for OKcoin, just FYI

It's the Chinese who crashed the market yesterday. I don't think it's the Wall Street. Wall Street likes cheap btc, but they understand the risk / reward ratio.  Wall Street will not dump to an extent where the majority of people lose confidence in bitcoin. 
Yesterday's crash was malicious.  There has been a number of malicious people on a Chinese forum 8btc.com, who tried to convince the mass to dump at 6k(the bottom), spreading FUD and fake news.
OKEx is a Chinese exchange with leverage trading available, and there was a massive increase in volume on OKEx and Bitfinex(geologically close to mainland China) yesterday.
There have been rumors about:
1. OKEx has deliberately sabotaged inexperienced leverage traders, by generating large btc price spikes in opposite directions within a short amount of time.
2. Okex can generate FAKE btc out of thin air, and those fake coins were used to crash the market.  Some Chinese traders reported today that it takes way longer than normal to withdrawal btc from OKEx(them running outta real bitcoin?).

Crypto will be better off without China

Financial News is a well-known FUD source in China.
most FUD articles about btc turned out to be either fake or from months ago

I remember that one, low volume for 2-3 days followed by a huge dump

I hope they don't
Need to transfer coins to wallet when it's back up

The volume at 7.8k is good.  But it's not a strong enough bounce I'm afraid, compared to that 8k btc sell

Since Binance has been down, and multiple Chinese exchanges have been having down/withdrawal issues since yesterday, here is the conspiracy theory.  You should understand why centralized exchange is bad.
1. Assume BTC market price is 20k.
2. Centralized exchange can put up a sell order @ significantly lower than 20k, selling NON-EXISTENT bitcoin.
3. Some user bought this fake bitcoin at 19k, with usdt, say.  As long as this fake bitcoin is not withdrawn to the user's private wallet, it's just a number in the buyer's exchange account.
4. Centralized exchange continue low ball selling fake bitcoin.
5. Panic sell starts.
6. Exchange put up buy orders, using those accumulated usdt to buy up real bitcoin at a cheaper price.
What if panic sell fails and price shoot up?  What if a massive # of users trying to withdrawal at the same time?  The centralized exchanges now go into maintenance mode, or claiming "hacked".
Feel free to downvote if you think this is nonsense.

Quad has a lot of price manipulation due to low volume.  When I bought my coins in late December, the USD/CAD exchange rate on Quadrigacx reached 1.45 at some point, and consistently stayed above 1.33 in late Dec.

9400 -&gt; 9464 volume is low, very deceiving

There is something shady about Binance.
The volume yesterday was nowhere compared to Feb 5 - Feb 6.  Binance is NOT going down because of "high volume" on Feb 7, or whatever data sync issue.
They are likely going down because they are running out of legit bitcoin, or haven't made enough profit outta those who sold at 6k.
I hope they don't end up getting "hacked".
