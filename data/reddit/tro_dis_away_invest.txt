Chimed in to say I recently just sold half of what I had left after mining in 2010 (around 300btc) to buy an apartment. There's a lot of us out there, we're just quiet about it and keep to ourselves most of the time. Still holding the rest in case we hit some insane price in 10-20 years.

except that nothing in this thread post has anything to do with what you just mentioned. You merely copy-pasted this here and about [10 other threads]( indiscriminately and without any consideration, Hence SPAM. 
The funny thing is you think no one would notice such an action (one merely has to click your username to track how you've done this many times) and that it would bear any negative repercussion on this business you're trying to advertise. 
The fact that you can't even correlate annoying online spamming with the negative public perception it will cause, does not speak highly of your ability to run a successful business.

Let's just say I took the 'hodl' credo very seriously. 
For real though, I'm at the point in my life now where I don't wish to pay rent anymore. Previous to this there were still a lot of questions about how to cash them out and where to do it without huge fees or risks.

Since when does phoning it in equate with lying, you spammed 10 threads and couldn't even be bothered to do more than cut and paste. 
Spam is still spam no matter how much rhetoric you employ. 
The audacity of asking me to ignore you on my own thread is priceless. You still expect to convince users you're a reputable business while engaging in juvenile tactics. 
Good luck with that.

you're calling bullshit why exactly?

I'm worried about slippage selling this large an amount of coins.

I doubt it, most people still aren't at the level where they would take BTC for this type of transaction. The seller has an existing real mortgage to pay down in fiat.

yet again, I'm not the one that wanders into random threads going off topic about their store no one cares enough to visit. For the record you've used every chance at a rebuttal to my criticisms to call me disingenuous, equate spam to lying, and ignore the fact that **no one** else has responded to your spamming (if it's so useful).
I do find it funny that you think any of these responses you write won't make your business look unprofessional. Though I don't see how much more illegitimate you could appear at this point. 
(to top it off you also don't seem to really understand the definition of hubris)

I mined back in 2009 on an atom cpu, I've kept 1/4 of mine. Cashed out some before that to buy an apartment, paid entirely in cash. Still a millionare. The recent BCH fork was a nice bit of free money for those of us still holding onto large amounts of btc still. I traded across to btc in total about 100k USD.

I appreciate the comment, but I'll still hold on to some that I mined.

Thanks a lot, maybe I'll even do an update here if it all works out.

Yup I may end up going with Kraken actually.

Newly minted bitcoin millionaire here (yes literally in USD). You'd be really surprised how quickly the initial excitement ends and loses it's impact. If anything it makes life a bit harder because you have more options than you did before, you realize you can just buy your way out of some uncomfortable choices in life. It's kinda like how getting the cheat codes to your favorite video game makes it no longer fun.
