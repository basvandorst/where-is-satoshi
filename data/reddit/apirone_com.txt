 If your services are not very expensive, I do not see any information on your site .. try **Blockonomics**. On the contrary, you can use **Apirone's** REST API to start accepting bitcoins with a fixed commission (0.0002BTC / transaction) regardless of the amount order.

If you have products costing more than $ 50, you can try Apirone for WooCommerce:   [
It works with a fixed commission (0.0002BTC / transaction), regardless of the amount of the order. So you do not have to worry about transaction fees.

Next task: collect TAGs for addresses. Because different sites have own bitcoin tags, like [blockchain.info]( blockcypher, blockchair, etc.
When we gain more then 300k DB, we will create API.
