Bitcoin.de works for BTC, BCH, ETH (also maybe BTG??). Advantage/Disadvantage is you have no FIAT there, but do it with SEPA directly to the person you are buying from, while your BTC is locked. Also, as someone else here pointed out, the prices seem to be always a bit 'behind' of the market maybe due to this (Price rise and fall with a slight delay)

You could, for example, make an agreement with someone, that in one year, you sell him 1 BTC for 8000. For this *buy option* he gives you, say 100.
If bitcoin falls below 8100 at this point in time next year, you win 100€, as the other one wont buy at the higher price.  
If bitcoin is above 8000, you loose [8100 - BTC price].  
For sure you can see why this is risky now, as the seller of the option could gain at maximum 100, if bitcoin is worthless in one year. However, if bitcoin rises to 1 million, you loose 999.900.
There are a lot more possible variations to this. [For further reading](

If you want to mine for your own manipulated part of the chain, you are not contributing to the correct "main" chain. Thats because you can not mine two different chains with the same hardware.

Are you having a stroke? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:16:59
You sure its not: **sqrt((0² + 1M2²)/2)**
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:03:40
Meh, also all lambos look basically the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:59:02
Neat. So a btc could be worth 100M fiat before hitting any significant problems with "too small" payments. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:02:50
How the LN handles channels. Its working, and it is secure. But its a relatively complicated process. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:17:00
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:00:15
Two horizontal lines :-D
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:18:32
Nah, if BTC is 1M$ its the same as the US M2 supply. Not talking into account, that its a global currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:31:11
Yep, same here. Paid on the exchange i use 80cents for a tx even on my non segwit adress. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:33:20
0.2€ seems a bit much? How many kWh do you use a year. Should be at least below 0.15€
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:39:20
2015 it crashed 80% from ATH, this time 75%, although in a much shorter time. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:46:08
Watching closely since years:
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:11:06
Maybe if it happened 2 months ago
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:09:02
Lol. 99% of people dont even know what a hedge is. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:36:48
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:39:54
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:20:51
I think with real segwit its 4. The other method (starting with 3-adresses) is 2
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:47:41
Maybe not that much in america, but africa for sure. And there would be massive amounts of people moving towards other countries with intact infrastructure. For sure "peacfully", as they struggle to even fulfill their basic food and water requirements.
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:53:35
It would be the same, i guess, BTCearth a d BTCmars, 1:1 exchanged with LN
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:19:40
Its different and becomes worthless? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:28:07
Do you by any chance frequent a glorious sub called I see you fitting right in. 100% autism compatible. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:52:46
Sounds nice for hodling now, but i hope it changes in the future. Tax nightmare if used for everyday payments. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:21:43
If only 0.1% of you humans transacted by btc thats 330$ per year and user.
Your last paragraph is true however. We are early adopters
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:44:38
The interest is a part of this. Cant stay low forever 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:00:52
Yep, Im sure glad they are back
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:44:15
Oh, i learned that today. 1BTC = 500 Pizzas (or 40000 bananas)
@_date: 2018-07-03 04:44:37
Meh, most likely you wont be able to buy 2, or half of your groceries. Bitcoin never more than doubled in a month
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:54:29
Really? I guess the reason is one's about interesting technology and memes, whereas the other is, russian propaganda
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:15:04
"all money" in what? Cash, stocks, real estate, virtual money in banks/debt?
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:47:38
Pineapple Fund guy did this and it worked
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:33:50
Why not B and ß. Its an s but looks like a B. Its actually used (in german) and not some fantasy letter. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:14:26
If you buy now for 8.5M, and sell at 280k, you'd have 400M
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:03:50
The average wealth is around 4000$ according to this site (
So 2.8 mBTC = 4000 -&gt; 1 BTC = 140k
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:10:53
Its actually pretty common to pay 1€ or 50ct for the toilet in europe. Why not, somebody has to clean it. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:38:11
And how often do you receive money -during- being offline. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:36:07
Or ß, which is actually a letter like s
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:01:31
Same here, waiting a bit to see if there is a hotfix necessary is usually a good idea. Cant wait to movie over to segwit
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:28:16
ẞ - the german "sharp s" would be nicer. Its like an S, but is only usable as a small letter. And it looks like a B
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:23:32
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:26:32
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:35:07
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:09:29
Maybe use LN, pay 10k ß for a dump. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:06:28
Use a log chart please, when plotting over more than a order of magnitude. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:12:29
**BIT CO NEEEEEEECT**
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:36:29
True: 10 times less by only shifting a bit
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:22:18
Yeah, that damn internet. Was quite interesting while it was around. Weird concept though, thats why it never took off. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:47:34
Now 0.07 micro dollars
@_date: 2018-04-19 04:57:39
Is it? I was looking to book a hotel through it with btc, but heard a lot of negative about them(extra cost,läßt minute changes) . How was your experience? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:41:48
Thats the reason why you diversify 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:47:06
You just made your own point. How old is bitcoin vs how old is the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:22:52
Why the deck of cards? Care to explain your method? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:45:12
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:07:04
I ordered the LN sticker, opening the channel for 500sat fee, then a few payments with a 7sat fee (0.0005€) each. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:43:43
Its a log scale. It could be anything between 110k and 300k before dipping again
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:26:26
We are still in the 1995-internet phase of bitcoin (age 10 years depending on how you count). Web 2.0 was still 10 years away. It was the age of *high capacity floppy disks*. Amazon, Google Wikipedia were not existent. How did your mum surf the web then? How old where you then?

Two men enter, one man leaves. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:49:51
I think its a chance. If you have A 0.7 sat and B 0.3 sat, each has 70% or 30% chance of getting 1.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:09:54
I was setting a manual fee of i think 2(or even 1) sat/byte - took around 45 minutes to confirm. Actually it was 546sat
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:56:03
Good idea to give some people a starting point for further research. Maybe add some more links. If you want to, i can contribute with a german translation.

Let me tell you guys that I am SO EXCITED, I am SO HAPPY I am really so thrilled to be right now!
Sharing this amazing, glorious, SUPER and EXCITING moment of my life with all of you guys—and let me tell you that we are really changing the WORLD as we know it. The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be, mm mm MM, NO NO NOH!

Its still cheap right now. Around 6k was the bottom. That was a 75% sale. Right now its still &lt;50% from ATH
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:40:23
Finally this meme is back
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:42:50
Maybe you could also put the trading volume in USD equivalent, to accommodate for the price increase?
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:43:27
Historically, it takes 60 years for the USD to inflate to 1/10 of its value. Over the last 10 years  it has only lost 15% of its value. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:57:35
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:28:20
Just from the official inflation values. Real inflation might be higher tho.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:58:17
That would be a new one (Price below last ATH)
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:43:02
So you expect a tripling in 6 months, and only put in 4$? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:00:14
The shift of money from weak common people, to rich whales has already begun. Soon the distribution of btc will be the same as the fiat money 
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:14:04
Is there no wash trade rule for bitcoin?

The irony is immesurable, and my day is made.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:31:19
Its already below 3k in Euro
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:23:42
Meh, you have to mine manually, and it only gives a few $ per hour. If you want to increase the payout, you have to invest heavily. ROI when?
