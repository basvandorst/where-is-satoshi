Just to note: people who have invested in Pirate, each have thousands if not tens of thousands in his hold. I hope to God they will do their own research before *panicking*.

Thank you for the smooth transaction. I appreciate your honesty.

Oh interesting. Thank you. Where does the bot send the tip to? Also, have long have you been into Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2012-07-06 03:29:06
Apologies then. This meme is meant to be enjoyed, not necessarily taken literally. 
@_date: 2012-11-30 15:54:10
Thank you for the suggestion. I will give it a go. I appreciate the post. 
edit 1: I tried, and failed to do the SMS approach.
edit 2: also what is the tip bot?
@_date: 2012-11-30 15:54:49
Thank you. I will look at those two sites you linked. My older brother told me he only has enough coins for himself. 
@_date: 2012-12-01 08:32:06
Cheers mate!
@_date: 2012-11-30 16:04:49
Thank you. I think this may be too lengthy a process but I appreciate the suggestion. Have you used Bitcoinnordic before?

Perhaps I could give someone Reddit Gold for a month or two in exchange for some coinage.
@_date: 2012-07-09 01:14:07
Remove  entirely. The other reasons are sound enough.
@_date: 2012-11-30 15:55:40
I could try doing this for you.
Send me a message please.

I am based in the UK. However, I believe I could purchase something for an American. Where do you live?
@_date: 2012-11-30 16:22:54
Nice. I am really digging Bitcoin so far. I can see how you got hooked. 
@_date: 2012-12-03 22:40:37
Nice thanks.
