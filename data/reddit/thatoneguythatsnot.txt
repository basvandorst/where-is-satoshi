I wish I would have known that I didn’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. I never got into it because when I finally learned about it the price was 300 bucks. I didn’t have the spare cash to fork out for one.

I did too, but just cause I needed it to buy other alts on bittrex. Now I’m stuck with them since Coinbase takes forever to credit purchases.

Lol, did you watch the gif?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:59:26
What do you suggest? I’m totally new to this. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:37:01
If you go to your accounts and then select the wallet for BTC there will be a list of your transactions. If you select the transaction you can see what the price was at the time of purchase. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:24:55
It's pretty damn easy, but at the same time their fees suck and they are so slow when using a bank account to make purchases. Credit card as long as it's visa or mastercard are instant, but the 4% fee is ridiculous.

How about not taking forever to process a damn buy? Made a buy on November 3rd. Almost a week later and it still hasn't posted yet. The funds left my account in seconds.

This is only because they are more wide spread. Give me an In n Out burger any day. When I'm in Vegas it's the first and last stop of my trip. And the line is almost always out the door. I've never been to another restaurant that had lines out the door at nearly all times of the day.

Fucking EXCELLENT explanation!! That’s about as eli5 as it gets and should be it’s own post for all us noobs. A+

I agree. It was super easy to setup a coinbase account. The fact that they have an app (even though I've been told that's a bad idea) puts it into the hands of regular people that don't have time to go through all the hoops of signing up for an exchange and going through the validation process.

I wish I had understood this way back when we were making a big deal about BTC reaching 500 bucks. I would have been slowly dropping money into it all this time. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:50:04
Lol, I figured you just didn't get the joke in the middle. Sometimes they read really fast and they can be hard to follow. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:23:47
Thanks for this. I signed up a week ago and now I can’t sign in with two-factor authentication. I opened a ticket and they said it was because my clock was off by more than 2 minutes. BS. My clocks are all correct. Screw these guys. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:49:48
Yeah, the thought of dropping 500 bucks on something that could cost me that was too much to risk. But heck, 25 bucks here, maybe 50 bucks there and I'd be set, lol. I'm still learning how to setup the wallet and the exchange. Right now I'm using coinbase which is a pain in the ass to deal with. They are just slow and their support doesn't exist.

My only problem was a long time employee that worked the counter. We'd buy one of those cards that got us a discount there. Two large pizzas for half off. So I'd go buy two pizzas loaded up and every time I went to pick up this girl was a total brat. Like me picking up pizza and even tipping for a pizza I WAS PICKING UP was such an inconvenience to her. We complained to corporate and they offered us a free pizza. We declined and haven't been back since.

There was some helmet to helmet contact, but because he went from being a receiver to a runner it makes the rules of contact change. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:30:54
How would you tackle someone in rugby? If they aren’t looking at you you can’t hit them? I can understand it being a bit less contact in rugby since there aren’t pads.

We’ll have to pay people to take them from us.

Anyone know of a good IOS application I can connect to my bank account? I tried using  coinbase, but their customer service is nonexistent. Tried two times to validate two different sets of amounts deposited and they still say the amounts are incorrect.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:33:38
You can't hit a defenseless receiver. At the time of the hit he was a runner. He just didn't look in the direction he was going. That guy hit him from the front technically. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:19:10
What should I be using? I'm trying to do it on IOS.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:48:28
So fucking pissed at coinbase right now. Their system for authenticating my bank account is jacked up. I was trying to get setup when the price was 5200. Fuckers just cost me a grand. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:47
It was a legal hit though. The runner should have been looking where he was going. He ran into the defensive player too. He was trying to be clever and juke people and got nailed for it. You can't run sideways and not look where you're going. The runner has to be responsible for their own safety too. You can't just NOT tackle the guy because he's not looking. It's not the same thing as a QB's blind side, which is illegal.

Did you tell her they already hatched and then immediately went into hibernation?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:51:39
I remember thinking it was a scam too. I really wish I would have bought 20 bucks worth just to say I was part of it. I’d be a rich man today.

I've tried to explain the concept of using my VTC to buy stuff and then just buy more VTC. Then I'm not losing the "value" of my spent VTC, but I am using it and adding to the crypto-economy. Of course now I can't do that and I have to HODL like my life depends on it because the value lost about 50% and I would have been better off hodling my cash.  
  
Shit, I just talked myself out of spending my crypto. New argument! Fiat to crypto takes too long to be able to negate the volatility of the market! We need faster fiat to crypto exchanges. Not like coinbase where it takes a week to credit your account.
