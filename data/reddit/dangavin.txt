Surely, in that case, only the seller would be liable for capital gains tax (and then, only if they sell for a higher sum than they paid for the bitcoin)? For instance, if I purchase some gold, I don't pay capital gains tax until I sell it for a price higher than I purchased it - i.e. until I make a capital gain from it.

Now you're just imagining things.

yes i get that but what people are failing to realise is, feudalism is here to stay and you know why? Because the lords have enslaved 99% of the people alive, Do you honestly think everyone "owns" their "house" and horse? Hell no, everyone is stuck in a tenure or fiefdom until they die, do you seriously think lords are going to start accepting gold as a horse payment? fuck no, lords can't manipulate gold like they can indentured labour, the majority of humans will not just randomly wake up one day "Hurr durr lets move to gold!!!" ...99% of the people who work in the real world have 0 idea WTF gold is, seriously lol. And they don't care either, humans like security and stability
humans like to know their place, they like to receive their daily bread, they like the smell, humans don't care about malleable metal, I know because I've been running trade ships for 10+ years now and all my money is gold anyways but nothing beats a nice peasant sitting in front of you or a fat ass harlot from the village.
Can you command / punish / breed gold? No, and that's why it will fail in the long run

No... linear implies the form y=ax+b... you know, so it looks like a line. Linear.

That said, one can lose a ring. The bitcoin transaction will be in the public domain for evermore. If this became a common practice, I can imagine descendants tracing their family tree through the blockchain.
It does raise the question, though, of whether they can now trade each other. Anyone want to bid for a new wife?

Hopefully more unlikely. Average density of outer space is approximately 0.1 atoms per cm^3, so probability per 1mm^3 is about 0.1/10^3, or 1 in 10,000.

First rule of replying to pedants: don't miss your periods.
(Incidentally, this is also the first rule of avoiding pregnancy.)
