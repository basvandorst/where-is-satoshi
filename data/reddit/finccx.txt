It happened! As promised all our users may now enjoy EUR trading. Deposits and withdrawals are processed in euros as well.

We are happy to announce that we have launched EUR trading! Analyzing the market situation and interacting with the community helped us to see that adding EUR trading to our offer will improve it and will bring significant value to the Bitcoin community as not many reliable exchanges, even in Europe are offering EUR trading option.

Just confirmed it. We don't use it yet.

I'd like to point out one important factor, our fees.  .Depending on the way you trade you can either be a price-taker or a price-maker, and either pay us commission or earn commission from us.
@_date: 2015-02-28 10:09:01
It's on our to-do list :)

Sorry for late reply. Founders are private investors including earlier mentioned FinFX and FinFX's founder Jani Hjerppe

Mika Liebkind is new in Bitcoin community, however, he is experienced CEO and he has a long trading experience in Forex and Futures markets.

Thanks for your feedback, we are considering adding BTC/EUR option, just a bit later. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:06:35
Not implying anything :)

Yes, our about us page needs more info and we are improving our site constantly. Mostly the same people are behind FinCCX as well as FinFX (FinFX is a foreing exchange broker  Account opening does require documents due to KYC (Know Your Customer) and anti-money lanundering laws. Funding can be done by wire transfer (just add your login as the message) or you can fund your account with bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-27 08:52:43
Because FinFX is a Forex broker and FX brokers handle BTC as a CFD, and we wanted to create a true Bitcoin exchange market place.

You are mixing Finland with Atlantis or Bielefeld

It seems that all our developers are currently sleeping, I'll check with them in the morning
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:19:22
Finnish company, serious owners and the bank did their due dilligence.
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:25:56
Thank you for your comment. We'll add the information about founding members and exact security measures to our website, it's a good point. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:32:17
Bitcoin is considered a commodity in Finland so the general attitude is very open and Finland is know from adapting new technologies and ideas quickly
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:48:34
Thank you for the feedback. We hope to add Euro as an alternative to USD in near future
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:38:25
Not only is Finland a major part of Scandinavia, Finland is the defining factor that puts the scan in Scandinavia

Wincapita has nothing to do with FinFX and FinCCX. So it is irrelevant to mention it here. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 12:35:21
Thank you!

FinCCX offers a real-time BTC trading, whereas FinFX would only offer BTC as a CFD. So FinCCX has a completely different concept in its foundation. Have to mention that we are one of not so many other exchanges who offer a price-maker, price-taker commission structure. In our view it's quite strong benefit for traders. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:47:57
Finland used to be a part of Sweden for more than 500 years, guys.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:41:10
We require same documents from all users: ID, Proof of Address and Bank Document. Verification is done within 24 hours on business days. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:08:30
USD because it's most widely traded

Once we grow enough the moon is not totally out of the question
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:43:18
well, if  you look at the signs from the position of the trader (that's how we did) then they are correct :)
@_date: 2015-02-27 08:34:18
No, bitcoin is VAT-exempt in Finland
