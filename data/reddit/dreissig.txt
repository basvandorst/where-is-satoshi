Depending on how the payment processor works, no. At my old job, all the transactions were sent in at intervals of 20 minutes. You never had to wait. It would print out a receipt for the amount right after I clicked confirm on the till, the customer signed it, I kept the receipt as proof and the transaction gets sent about 10 minutes later.

That's not a good comparison because it's backwards. We're the ones wanting to use the money that almost no one else is accepting, so I'd be like if we wanted to pay with euros on NYC. They have to do a bunch of extra stuff to let us use our euros, so it might just be simpler for them to say they don't accept them.

I find it annoying that people write Bitcoin too. I see more bittorrent (with a minuscule) than Bittorrent (bittorrent is another Internet protocol), so why does everyone seem to write bitcoin with a capital?
Germans get a pass on this because to them all nouns are majuscule.

Because that's not intuitive. It's like calling a millimetre a camel because it's got two 'humps'. Most people probably won't understand either example.

***A virtual coin called bitcoin***
*This was a week of volatility for the new decentralised monetary system that works on the internet but has very real repercussions. What is it?*
2013-04-21, sunday
By Nicolás Mendoza and Felipe Lozano Puche for El Tiempo
London - «It's the mother of all bubbles!» says Michael Parsons [name sited incorrectly as Carsons in article] (scottish, 65), a retired banker and fervent blogger, about the behaviour of the virtual currency bitcoin the past few days. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a mysterious programmer--who has now vanished--known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Today, Nakamoto's creation is hit deserving praise for some, or an object of criticism by others.
The hyperbole from Parsons, who works on projects associated with the bitcoin economy, instils the same story: it starts to rise in january (where it was around 10 USD) and in this past april it was worth ten times more. One coin that, in one day (10 april), went from 200 USD to 266, down to 50 USD in order to, finally, stabilise itself around 100 USD.
Gavin Andresen, who himself is considered a responsible bitcoin scientist, attributes this instability to the speculators and assures that «To the extent that bitcoin increases in value and the infrastructure that surrounds it reaches a certain maturity, its price in relation to other currencies will be prone to stabilisation».
But what exactly is bitcoin? It's a decentralised virtual monetary system and as such issues its own money (bitcoins), which allow payments to be made between users, some of which see it as an excellent investment. «Its operation and self-determanation--it doesn't have any central governing body to administrate it, like central banks and such--are based on the collective work of computers of thousands of its users throughout the world that dedicate them to solve complex cryptographic equations», explains Ésteban Zamora, journalist from [the popular spanish-language tech blog] Fayer Wayer. The result of this process is the issuing of bitcoins and the confirmation of all transactions done with these coins.
Philosophically, bitcoin is the expression of discontent towards the financial system that that was provoked by the 2008 financial crisis. For 'hacktivists' like Amir Taaki, a London-based programmer from an irani background who belongs to a group who promote and help design this system. «It's the true currency of the free market, the money of the people».
Something to know is that the first time that bitcoin was used to buy a consumer good was in may 2010, when a user transferred ten thousand bitcoins (as of then without a determined price) to another user in a chat room on Bitcointalk in exchange for the user sending a pizza to his home.
The amount of participation in bitcoin through the world has already broke one billion US dollars. «It's a tiny amount for the big investment firms in the City (the financial district of London), but it's considerable if you think about the smaller agents in of the system», adds Parsons. In effect, companies like Reddit, Wordpress or Expensify already accept payments in bitcoin, along with a multitude of small businesses and independent workers, attracted by the benefits of adopting it.
It hasn't been long since the case of the house for sale in Alberta, Canada which was payed for in bitcoins. And in Texas, United States a family reported selling a 2007 Porsche Cayman S for 300 bitcoins (at the time worth about 39 000 USD). In the previously mentioned country, a company called Lamassu hopes to sell a 'bitcoin machine' through which people can buy and deposit bitcoins directly in an account by using a mobile phone app.
**How do you get them**
There are two ways to 'get yourself into' bitcoins. In the beginning, in order to become a bitcoin 'miner' it was enough to just download the software, which is free and open-source, and let it solve the cryptographic equations that the blogger Zamora mentioned earlier. Four years later, this activity has been specialised to the point in which there are businesses, like Avalon, who manufacture CPUs exclusively designed for bitcoin mining. The cost in equipment and energy make it necessary for the miners of today to make large investments.
But there's another way to get them: get into some of the almost 11 million that have already been produced--the limit is 21 million and that will be reached around 2140, to the extent that the algorithms that the currency depends on keep functioning. You can get some directly, purchasing them from another user or accepting bitcoins as a method of payment, or through intermediary markets like mtgox (based in Japan) where more than 70% of all bitcoin transactions are made.
Parsons manages a fraction of his bitcoins like 'cash', from an iphone app (he uses the most popular, Blockchain), but he saves his earnings in a computer disconnected from the internet, a standard practice of community members. «Bitcoin is like cash; security is an important element», he says. In 2011, the the spanish daily ABC reported that a netizen left his computer on all night whilst he slept and a hacker took 500 thousand dollars in bitcoins. And, because there are no middlemen, he had no-one to turn to reclaim them.
Something to know is that the largest fortune in the bitcoin economy is owned by the Winklevoss brothers, the twins that sued Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook (shown in the film *The social network*), who have recently been recognised as having invested 11 million dollars in the currency.
According to what they said to the press, they guard their bitcoins in bank safes in three different cities. «People that say it's a ponzi scheme-- affirmed Cameron Winklevoss. --They don't want to take it seriously. But at some moment they story will change because virtual currency will be here to stay».
On top of this, the system maintains a register of all transactions, once they've been verified, but in exchange the identity of the users is very difficult to determine, and the majority are anonymous.
In order to open a bitcoin account, you have to download an app that generates an account number and a 'digital wallet' (in january 2012 there were 400 and today there are over 228 thousand; each user can have more than one). This address is you use for all bitcoin transactions and the only thing that matters is you never have to give personal information to the system. These characteristics have been exploited by websites such as Silk road, where bitcoins are the only method of payment, and they are used to buy and sell drugs and other illegal products.
In spite of that, and openly defying the sovereign monopoly of nations in the currency market, until now bitcoin has existed in a legal limbo, protected by its obscurity and insignificance. In the US, a recent declaration by the federal government indicated that 'decentralised virtual currencies' were also subject to anti-money laundering laws, making the first reference--although veiled--to bitcoin by authorities of that country. The mention, regardless, leaves much anxiety without resolving the legal future of bitcoin.
The inventor's disappearance, it's clear, wasn't an obstacle to the development of decentralised system, and in exchange he added a mystic tint to the phenomenon. In 2011, the magazine *The New Yorker* sent a journalist after Nakamoto's trail without success. Even today, no-one knows about the possible identity of the inventor.
**The experiences of a colombian**
Ernesto and his wife were 'disillusioned' to the banks. He, a colombian that lived for years in Spain and who's now returned to Colombia, hadn't even had a bank account, but he *did* have 30 000€ in savings.
«We knew that it was mad in a way, but we felt safe because we saw what could happen. And truthfully, we didn't like that our money, the small amount it was, was giving more power to the banks». So eight months ago they 30 000€ worth of bitcoins at 9 USD per bitcoin.
How did they do it? «It was complicated at first. In this day and age nothing's easy. We spent four months figuring out how to do it. In the middle of this process, the price rose. We decided to buy through mtgox, who charge a very small rate». On this site, which functions like a virtual market, people meet one another to buy and sell. Sending money was a real risk, remembers Ernesto. They had to send the cash to a bank in Poland and they didn't know if it arrived successfully. The notification came to them in a week. They bought 3700 bitcoins that were 'assigned' to an online wallet that had a code. Once they had bitcoins, they decided to wait whilst the currency gained value. «It was brilliant: we had payed nine dollars for them and there was a point where each one cost 256 USD». And they committed a catastrophic error: wait until they get one million dollars to sell. They were going to do it when one bitcoin was worth 277 USD. But that didn't happen.
When the currency's volatility started this week, they got scared and decided to sell almost everything. «In the end, we made 225 000€, --that, they say, are available at their bank. And why did the price fall?-- I think the speculators meddled with it --he says-- The big businesses and corporations did it to attack bitcoin too. And the mtgox platform collapsed: this too is one of the reasons responsible for the crash. I'm waiting for it to drop to the right price before investing again. The price is very volatile, you don't know what's going to happen. I don't think this is a good time to jump into it».

I see some people talking about 'off the chain' transactions for very small amounts of money once one bitcoin is worth a large amount (&gt;1 000 000 €). If this value were to happen, how would these off the chain transactions work? How can one simply bypass the blockchain like that?

Word lesson!
It's current pronunciation in japanese is /en/. It's spelled yen in european languages because when the portuguese first arrived in Japan and made their dictionaries, the currency was spelled ゑん (wen, literally meaning round, from the same word as chinese 'yuan' and korean 'won'). In the Edo period, ゑ was pronounce as /je/, leading to the portuguese to romanise the word as 'yen'. However, the currency has been pronounced as /en/ for at least the past century in japanese, although the /jen/ pronunciation had survived in western languages.

I don't see why so other people are suggesting things like bit cents, especially as a division of the base unit when we already have subdenominations that use metric prefixes, and in casual usage have their own short forms in millibit and microbit. Every subdenomination should have its own unique name (even if it's 'inspired' by the metric names).

I think that if we are just talking about the concept of bitcoin, it should be lowercase. For example, we wouldn't write 'The price of Gold is x per gram' or 'As a reserve currency, Gold is the best option.' Same thing with actual currencies like pound sterling or euro (not suppose to be capitalised according to the EU).
For pluralisation, it can be either bitcoin or bitcoins. An example of currencies that have identical singular and plural are yen and won, and to an extent, euro. I would say to go with the expected English pluralisation and say bitcoins. For the subdevisions, I would say millibits and microbits.
The unnecessary capitalisation, in my opinion, disrupts the flow of a sentence. If I Wrote Everything Like This, It's Somewhat Jarring.

0,001 bitcoins are 1 millibitcoin (symbol: mBTC)/millibit/whatever you wanna call it. 0,001 millibits are 1 microbitcoin (µBTC)/microbit/whatever.
SI prefixes already exist and are used in applications. For example, many fountains I see (that aren't dead) tell their payouts in microbits and the price tracker on my mobile gives me the exchange rate at *x* US dollars per millibit.

Except that if bitcoins ever need to be subdivided bellow this new bitcent,or even the present satoshi, it gets awkward.
* 1,234 567 890 123 BTC or
* 1 234,567 890 123 mBTC or
* 1 234 567,890 123 µBTC or
* 123 456 789,012 3 bitcents/satoshi
Notice how one of these things doesn't match the other?
By already having satoshi, it creates a clash with the metric 10^-3*n* prefixes. Satoshi shouldn't exist as a unit; bitcoins should be subdivide by continuing the pattern.
There is a reason that currencies decimalised and became metric like the dollar. Before this, many currencies were like the pound and subdivided in numbers where calculating amounts together was more difficult. Whilst bitcoins aren't as bad as £1 = 12 shillings = 240 pence, having the satoshi as a subunit ruins the pattern of subdivision and sets an arbitrary low where further subdivision will be more difficult.
Everything besides metric 10^3*n* prefixes should be abolished to make bitcoin have the longest lifespan possible and make it future-proof.

One thousandth of a bitcoin is a millibit(coin). One thousandth of a millibit is a microbit(coin).
Just slap on SI prefixes. The symbols can be mBTC and µBTC respectively.
