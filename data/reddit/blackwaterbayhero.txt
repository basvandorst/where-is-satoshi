I think the whole concept is going over your head man. I'm not trying to be offending either. What we're talking about is this: the article pointed out that small number of bitcoin users own most of bitcoin. We were trying to debunk this by showing how using wallet addresses is not a good device for measuring bitcoin inequality. 
Then I was trying to hint at the distribution of bitcoin across population. As of now, a small number of individuals -- being us -- own most of bitcoin and most people don't have bitcoins. This is problematic for bitcoins growth. A more egalitarian distribution of  bitcoin is going to be necessary for wide adoption of it. 
You are pointing out some great facts about bitcoins and some problems that we both speculate bitcoin to maybe be a solution to. Those are all great but I don't think they have anything to do with this topic in hand.

That's not the value of bitcoin, that's the cost of mining it. The value is what the market is willing to pay for it, $3600 as of now. 
Just like how the value of a hundred dollar bill is not the cost of making the bill but what the market is willing to give you in exchange of it. 
Value does not necessarily equal the cost of producing "it," whatever that "it" might be.

The market cap needs to grow from current $60b to about $18 trillion for bitcoin to hit $1 million. So in other words we need 18 trillion dollars worth of investment to get there. That's 9 billion people each investing $500. 
So to answer your question: we gotta convince 9 billion people to invest their $450. That's how likely it is. 
Now it's not that unlikely either. To put $18 trillion in perspective: that's 36 years of us military budget combined.

I don't think it is. The technology is super new and everyone in tech kinda (kinda) knows this. I remember when card reader terminals were being first introduced in Iran. Only few stores had those terminals and accepted cards. They rarely worked. Everyone was skeptical. A lot of merchants didn't want to bring them because of the %3 fee. The kinks worked themselves out and now it's widely adapted and used. 
Bitcoin right now is how email was in 1992. Or how video chat was in 2004. It works but it has a lot of issues. The infra structure is weak. User interface is shitty. It takes time for it to get there. 
But please give me some examples of what you're talking about. How are we going closer to the currency system. I think I'm ignorant to that at the moment. 
Ps. I think even third party systems like PayPal and venmo are helping to get bitcoin widely accepted. Until a few years ago people couldn't just send money instantly to one another. Now thanks to PayPal and venmo they can. With awareness, they eventually want peer to peer, not a third party mitigator.

In that given scenario it's much more likely that there's going to be a long span of time where crypto and fiat will exist side by side rather than an over night collapse of fiat and rise of bitcoin. In that process, the value of bitcoin will overtime increase. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:03:51
$70 billion market cap won't just evaporated over night in the favor of a different currency. 
That new currency has to prove that it has crazy features or capabilities not offered by bitcoin. Features that won't easily be added to bitcoin either cause bitcoin is constantly changing. And in return bitcoin has to prove that there's no use for it to exist side by side that new crypto. 
If those two things happen then yes a new crypto would take over but realistically, bitcoins large market cap won't allow it to just stay stagnated and evolve with new features and stay relevant. 
That doesn't mean there won't be other currencies side by side bitcoin. For example right now, bitcoin cash and litecoin are great complimentary coins side by side bitcoin and ethereum is whole another ball game

It'd be so hard for them to actually enforce that since mines are in rural areas where no one knows about them and the local population economically benefits from them. They can scare everyone by making it officially illegal (he prices would drop --temporarily) but in terms of actually shitting them down and effecting the mining and hash power they can't do much.

I'm not talking about what might happen and what will happen to the value of bitcoin... you might be right, it might be a bubble, it might fall to 2000 or 1000. It might be inflated value or so on...
I'm just pointing out a simple economic fact that cost of something does not equal the value of it. The cost of a 16oz fountain Coca Cola is a penny or two, the value of it in the market is a couple bucks. It doesn't care if the value is inflated or if their selling it too expansive or if it's gonna fall. It doesn't matter. The value is simply not equal to cost. The cost and value are def relevant to one another but they are not necessarily equal.
And why would you even bring up dollar being backed by gold when you know the dollar is not backed by gold. The current value of dollar has nothing to do with gold cause there ain't no gold backing it. The value of dollar is the value that market gives it. Even if it was backed by gold then the question would be: what is the value of gold? Def not the cost of mining the gold!!
See, in the case of dollar, there is NOT "a physical thing that crest real value"
Not sure if it's a typical case of "oh I'm speculating crypto without fully understanding fiat or you're trying to imply that the fact that dollar was backed by gold 40 years ago is what gives it value today. 
See what I mean?!?! I don't care if the price is too high or too low, I'm just pointing out to you that cost doesn't equal value. 
Another few examples to clarify that concept would be these: 
1: there is a cost in electricity and computing power in calculating a random, very difficult math problem (not talking about bitcoin's) but if you were to pay that cost and solve that math problem the solution or answer you've arrived at doesn't necessarily have the value of the computing power you spent. The value will be determined by the usefulness and the utility of that solution. If it was an obscure math problem that no one cares about it'll be worth(valued) nothing even if you spent $2000 computing the solution. 
Cost =/= value 
2: the cost of cooking a dish that you'd buy in a restaurant is usually equal to %45 to %70 of the price they charge you for (depending on the dish and the restaurant) (the cost is calculated by adding the ingredients, labor, and rent of the place). The value of the dish (what you're willing to pay for it) tho is higher than the cost of course.
See what I'm trying to get at? Value and cost are correlated but almost usually, never the same.
So to say the value of bitcoin is what it costs to mine it is to totally ignore the market
P.s. I have seen that video of mcafee. I don't vividly remember it but I think he was pointing out that there's a cost in making bitcoin and it doesn't come from thin air. I'm not sure if he was trying to imply that cost equals value.

@_date: 2017-09-20 00:53:15
For the moment yes. Bitcoin is getting off the path. Because people mostly see it as an investment and because it's not fully operational for large scale adaption as a currency. Though his could change. Or it could stay as an asset/investment but pave the way for something else to become that currency in circulation. That's a scenario. But hey, more and more merchants are accepting it everyday and it's getting more and more easier to use it, faster and cheaper to send it. So in the long run this might just turn out to be a tiny phase.

This is a vision. This is a highly risky investment on an untested technology that might collapse tomorrow. If it doesn't then there'll be rewards for your risk taking investment but you ain't getting rich overnight by investing $450. Also, ain't nobody else giving you even $30 for that amount of investment, what do you mean only $300??

Fiat I think in Latin means "let there be"
When implied to currencies it's hinting at the idea of infinite printing power. You can just speak the words and there will be more dollars, something you can't do with bitcoin because of the 21 million cap. It's connected to the currency being backed or not being backed in this sense that if it's backed by something you can't just make more of it without having more of the backer. 
I know you said don't talk about Blockchain bluhbluh but it actually has to do with that. The Blockchain, because it's a computer code allows you to create a currency that's not backed by anything in a fixed amount i.e. Not being able to just produce more bitcoins. 
So that's why dollar is backed by nothing and is considered a fiat but bitcoin is backed by nothing and is NOT considered a fiat. You can't just let there be more bitcoin, unless you want to change the protocol thus, making it a fiat.

The crash of 1929 wasn't devastating because stock market went to ashes. It was devastating because people had bought all he stocks with money that they had loaned not money that they had. So when it went to ashes they still had to pay the loans.

Well, I think you are just dragging this. No one is looking into distribution of gold cause no one is looking at it as the future of money. If anyone considered it as the future of money, they'd be forced (!) to look at the equality of its distribution. And people do, quite a lot talk about the distribution of wealth as an issue and that includes property, stocks and investments, they're not just talking about money in the bank. It's a major discussion. Biggest uprising of my generation in the US was because of it (occupy movement) it's a major issue. I'm just saying it's as big of a issue with bitcoin too. Andreas Antonopolous thinks it's even a bigger issue with bitcoin.

If a $300 return is not worth investing $450 then what is? If it's not enough then you're trying to get rich overnight and that's not a possibility anymore. Want my opinion? You won't even be making $300 on $450 anytime soon but hey with bitcoin there's a possibility of increasing that $450 with other investments that's not even in the realm of possibility. 
You wouldn't talk lightly about a %66 return if you had an idea about the investment world. So that's why I'm saying ain't nobody making %5000 profits anymore -- aka ain't nobody getting rich overnight anymore. So take the %66 or go settle for that micro percent profit that your bank account gives you. 
Again, in my opinion, you're super lucky if it does make you $300 so don't sit around and talk lightly about %66. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:01:15
The monitoring public key part is a great idea!
The part about reaching goals and all; I'm not sure. It encourages the type of mentality that joins the crypto community and is expecting to get rick over night. The types that only think about how their investment is going to grown a hundred times in 2 months and all they care about is their portfolio growing. The types that have no regards for the well being or healthy growth of the market but they only care about getting rick real quick. 
We shouldn't encourage those sort of attitudes. Yes, we all want to make more money but if we focus too much on getting rick quick we will undermine the wellness of the network in exchange for a small quick profit.

Well I think your second paragraph explains the current rise in btc prices while everything else is stagnated or going down. 
And to your main point: I hadn't thought about their need to secure a strong vault. In that case, btc could just go in the direction of a race upon it for which bank can secure the most in their vaults. In effect this will escalate bitcoin's velocity towards solely becoming an asset and not a currency for trade.

For investments, metals are great. I don't want to get into the details of how and why which one is better. 
Though, the view on cryptos is that they're investments and assets now but overtime they will presume their originally intended role as currencies. There the difference is massive. You can't send silver over the internet without a third party regulator. The whole point of cryptos being, you can send them peer to peer without third part. And you can send super small chunks of it. Therefore, you can use them as currencies, something you can no longer do with precious metals in the age of internet (and we're talking about no third parties involved). 
If you are just looking into it as assets and investments then yeah figure out the safest best return. But here, we are also investing in a vision we have for future. We are investing in an idea to transform finance and monetary systems. For the short run we're making some profits sure. On the long run we might even make bigger profits, amazing. But the point is not JUST the profits for us, we believe in the mission too!

Ok, so what i have in mind is something like blockfolio that looks and feels way better and more contemporary for desktop or browser with some additional features that blockfolio is missing. I reviewed 's website right below and told him the features that I think would help his website. I'll just copy and paste that here as well.

Fair point. Also, not like we’re not gonna need loans because of crypto. Banks will be around for sure. No doubt in my mind.
