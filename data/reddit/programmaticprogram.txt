And by grow we mean drop 20% every time they get more crypto

I fairness the full shopping cart is Jan 1 2018, the almost empty one Feb 1 2018, and the half empty one two months later.

Yeah, I’m sure it’s that simple

Also, conceivably $1.6 billion in gold VS $1.6 in Bitcoin

I listened for a bit and all of just do gooderism about creating better people reminded me about the core goals of Christianity.  That’s not a bad thing.    Yeah, probably wise not to announce your crypto’s and make yourself a target.     I lost mine in a boating accident.

At least it’s a smooth slide all the way down 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:26:50
Ok, now is it the bottom?  Asking for a friend

What reason does he state?     
Am lazy and at work and can’t watch...  thank you for your understanding ahead of time kind redditor
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:59:45
You are probably right about that.  I was misinformed. Thank you for the correction!
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:12:44
Ok, selling some more....

Chantix is some bullshit they market because the previous drugs came off patent and generics aren’t profitable.   
Ask a doc about zyban/Wellbutrin instead of chantix.     Same deal about taking it while you smoke and then stopping smoking.   It takes away the urge to smoke, at least that’s what it did for me.

1 - I have some

More like say hi to a scam. Venezuela is pulling off the first state sponsored shitcoin.

I know it’s in the same family as Prozac, but at a lower dosage than for clinical insanity.    I got it as part of a smoking cessation program with my HMO.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:29:05
Sell high, buy low huh?   Let me write that down!
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:00:12
Check prices every 5 minutes until they’re at 20k again and then get out... but then, think maybe that they’ll keep going up again, so I better hodl some more.  Then it’ll crash again and I’ll hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:23:04
What are the smart people in the room saying about the bottom?   Where is it?
@_date: 2019-05-21 07:13:59
It’s like I know it but I shouldn’t say it!

Bitcoin made me poorer
