Maybe an investigation into the M-Pesa API will help figure out how BitCoin could be implemented in Kenya by interfacing it with something that they can use. Apparently the API will drop by the end of 2014 which by then who knows how far BTC has developed.
EDIT: Found -- 
PesaPI is an unofficial open source API for mobile money systems, released under the BSD(lite) license.
The system currently support:
Kenya: Mpesa paybill accounts
Kenya: Mpesa private accounts
Kenya: Yu private accounts (experimental)
Ghana: Airtel private accounts (experimental)
Rwanda: MNT private accounts (experimental)
The API supports both PUSH and PULL versions. The PHP version of the API is generally the most mature and recomended at this point - the system is build using Mysql and Curl. Please direct all questions to the public mailing-list "pesaPi" on Google-groups:

The other flip side of it is the money they take in is not 100% theirs. It's the money of the artists, their respective agents, their management ect. There are a bunch of people that need to take their cut which I did not really realize until he replied.

You can say all you want but there is also this.
"Between 2006 and 2009, according to DOJ, HSBC failed to monitor $670 billion in wire transfers and $9.4 billion in cash transactions from its Mexico bank operations."
Like I said, facts out there. I am not making this up. Hell, it could be WAY higher than what I said.

Thanks for the feedback. Pretty sure the number just goes back to the customer support line anyway. But yeah I do need to watch out for that next time.

Yes! Awesome. I live in Chattanooga, TN and I am only a 2 hour car ride away. Def down to go.

You know what, I've thought of this extensively. Just outside the realm looking at the bigger picture.
So Zuckerberg is worth $13.3 Billion based on something he stole. Keeping in mind the bigger picture. Zuckerberg sold out the US Population by giving his database access to the NSA. Also keeping in mind that he went and partnered with Sean Parker. The same Sean Parker who was recruited by the CIA for developing a web crawler.
Meanwhile, the Winklevoss take the United States Fiat money they settled with from the Zuckerberg lawsuit and converts it into a Stateless Currency and they attempt make the currency more easily accessible to the public investor space.
I don't know man... I don't think people give these guys enough credit. Sure, they are meatheads and all they care about is money. But let's really think here. What will the world really be like when the Winklevoss' ETF is worth more than Facebook.
Only time can tell these things. I am cheering them on. I really think they want to change the way things are. Analyze it that way.

Nope--the facts are out there. They laundered $680 Billion of Cartel Money.
You are thinking of how much they got fined which was $1.9 Billys or about 0.2% of what they laundered 
EDIT: The previous graph has some dodgy stuff on the Y-Axis (thanks to SkepticalEmpiricist for pointing out). Here is another source that confirms these claims. 
"Between 2006 and 2009, according to DOJ, HSBC failed to monitor $670 billion in wire transfers and $9.4 billion in cash transactions from its Mexico bank operations."

Hey man, you have a right to be analytical. Just saying...graphic designer could have typo'd that and accidentally added two zeroes at the end of that 1. 
I didn't really make up a number out of thin air that hasn't been reported or confirmed through other sources.
EDIT: Updated the original comment.

It won't be till rappers start rappin' about how they stackin' Bitcoin.

Woah. This guy is from Tennessee! That's crazy.

Yeah, I may need to reemphasis this. Doesn't matter. I know one of their customers (a promotion company that sells lots of tickets) gonna show him this. Said promoter has a friend who used Silk Road and he is aware of the value of Bitcoin but is not educated. It may bring insight. But love that they were aware about it.

Yeah, you're right. I maybe using the term "stole" a little too loosely. I don't really think that he stole consciously but he was developing for them at the same time he was developing something else. The difference was that Zuckerberg positioned his product as a social network and the Winklevoss' positioned their site as a "dating site". 
The book that "The Social Network" movie is based on is actually really detailed and more intriguing than the movie.

Fuck Amir. He has those Bitcoins and has done NOTHING.
@_date: 2013-07-02 22:13:53
Would then having Bitcoins in ETF open the gateway to move your Employer's 401k into this?

Yeah, it's more for the hedge fund guys though not the normal everyday people. From my understanding you can only buy into 50,000 Share "Baskets"
