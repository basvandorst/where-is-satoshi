And nothing of value was lost.
This reminds me of the stories written about the wallstreetbets guy who had a massive short on UVXY (or one of the other leveraged inverse VIX/volatility ETFs) and lost over a million dollars in hours earlier this year when the stock market had a swift intraday correction. 
The long and short (heh) of that story was that he had no place trading such instruments because he did not fully understand the behavior and consequences of his trade. He thought he was a stock market god having turned something like $100k into over a million dollars in a few short years, and got hosed with what he thought was a safe and sure bet.
CNBC and Bloomberg made an example of him, while he ebegged using gofundme. Pathetic really. I feel no sympathy for these people.

Civil War 2 would be more than 1v1. You're going to end up with a boatload of independent groups that will all form various alliances.

Save as much as you can with a diverse holding of fiat and crypto, pay off as many debts as you can, and keep working like a normal stiff. When the SHTF, you will be better prepared than most to take advantage of the clearance sales on assets of all sorts, particularly stocks and property. When it all comes back, you will be happy you lived modestly during times of greed and peak degeneracy (now).
I was in my early 20s in 2008, and took advantage of the low rates, free gubmint house credits, and foreclosure supersales to make a relatively comfy life where I could experiment with my own business ideas and passion projects in my mid to late 20s. Some failed. Some worked. Either way, I learned a lot and gained good experience for the next crash. I’m in a pretty good spot now to take advantage of whatever happens next, much better than 2008. So, bring it on.
Also, have some firearms for backup just in case we go full retard. Better to get em cheap now than for 3x the price during peak crazy. Hopefully, it will never be necessary. :)

Never seen a point in bcash. It's a centralized D-list Litecoin imitation that is branded like imitation sriracha. Sure, it tastes and looks similar, and since the original never trademarked anything, all the imitators can brand similarly...but they're all pretty unnecessary and never quite as good as the original. 
ETH and LTC make sense, BCash just comes off desperate and pointless. I'd also argue it's market penetration is inflated. No one really buys or believes in BCash. It's just pumped by a consortium of whales.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:17:44
Easy, there is no reason. Bcash offers nothing. If you want megaspeculative plays, there are far better altcoins available for that. If you want transaction efficiency, again, better options.

Banning crypto would only serve to increase its value in the longrun. I could almost guarantee that it would be paired with an introduction of an official "fedcoin" to replace paper, which would give the Fed and government complete information on private income and spending. No more hiding from the tax man, complete with algos to build personality profiles on every individual, and potentially use that to "prevent crime." Sounds looney, I guess, but it is totally within the realm of plausibility based off prior actions.
Decentralized crypto will ultimately be a thorn in the side of totalitarian governments (a list of which keeps growing) and gain value to a growing swathe of individuals that value freedom. When that time comes, the pairing of such currencies will decouple from dollars, euros, global fedbux, or whatever is considered "reserve" or "official" and create its own ecosystem of value.

What the fuck are you talking about? I literally bought my previous house for 50% off the previous owner's purchase price, and then sold it for a little more than a 50% gain. I didn't even include the $8000 "first time home buyer credit" and another $2900 in FHA reimbursements after repairing $300 worth of FHA-required safety issues.
All I put in was a new kitchen floor, repaint the inside, and replace the AC unit in the 5 years I lived there, all of which came to a grand total of $5200.
I didn't even make out that great compared to a lot of folks. For those really in tune, or buying in the right markets, 100% or higher gains were entirely possible since the crash. You must be in your 20's with no idea what the Great Recession was actually like for adults.
Half off will happen again, as real estate prices are (were?) higher than the '07-08 peak and many other credit and financial market bubbles are parabolic.

@_date: 2018-07-31 13:17:33
Not to be a downer, but I never had much faith in this latest rally. It looked like one last bull trap for the next sell-off to "new lows." I've said it for months, but BTC probably won't truly go for new highs until it tests our resolve at the support level of the old 2013 high (\~$1200). Now, it probably won't that low for an extended period, but I think a few weeks at $2000-3000 is probable, with anything below being a temporary freakout event that would last minutes. Then it will consolidate for a year or more before the $20k test. 
I'm not claiming to be a prophet or a professional. Just a guy who has seen this behavior many times before trading stocks since 2007. I bought my first BTC in 2015 at $220 for the same reason as above. The price held at the previous high for an extended period, which became a solid support around $200 and volatility had decreased. The time was right, so I began accumulating. 
In short, I don't think the weak hands have been flushed yet, and won't be flushed until one or two more good sell-offs take the price to $3000 or lower. The "told you so" news articles will be non-stop for a few months, and this subreddit will be filled with anti-BTC shills. Eventually that will cease, things will go quiet, the memes will slow to a trickle, and the noobs will either give up and sell at the lows, or take the opportunity to average down during the BOGO sale. You'll know it's time to buy when it gets pretty quiet and the intelligent discussion to idiot meme/shill video ratio has improved. 
Then maybe we hit $100k in 2020-21, and the cycle repeats, like it always does. Remember to sell next time.
