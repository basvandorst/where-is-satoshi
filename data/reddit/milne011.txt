The Bar in my area that takes Bitcoins cashes them out right away so they get the required cash value to cover the bill. The Owner with the point of sale app for Bitcoins has his account set up that he can choose to set it to sell the bitcoins right away, or to keep a certain percentage as coin and cash out the rest, and of course keep it all as Bitcoin.

Actually it got a lot of press now for some reason. I think it had to do with the fact that they are also going to accept other crypto currencies to. I wish my local comic book shop started taking Bitcoins. Heck I'm hoping that I'll start to see it at conventions soon at vendor booths. Geekiness for Bitcoins!

You can also use Canadianbitcoins.com you can sell to them and get direct deposit through them to your bank account or get a payment delivered through express mail. Or if you live in Ottawa you can go to their office and pick up a payment there. Sometimes same day, usually a day or two.
