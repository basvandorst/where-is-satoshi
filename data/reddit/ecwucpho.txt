Remember that in the case of bankruptcy there is no money put aside for salaries and ALL assets are up for grabs including office desks and chars and everything else for that matter. We really can not only expect them to liquidate every single dollar and just be broke, it is fair and square to demand it.

Looking at BFX wallet addresses such as 3QJ9zdErojJiTNvNDrFhagVaFEgNDFEfUL and following the trail to the wallets the BTC were removed from to the last addresses undre BFX control like 3NEBfhuQP75jmidF7Bz3zXj3BJaJdRSur4 it is very apparent that a) they were compromised since the "Platform issues" on Jul 27, 2016 as described here  and b) most of the BTC was taken from multi-signature addresses that were not user segregated accounts. It's like someone opening a bunch of bank-boxes and leaving it in the banks lobby for days before bothering to take it out of the building. Zane keeps saying "The Bitcoin was stolen from segregated customer wallets, however that does not mean that only those who had btc in those wallets were affected so it is not that straightforward." but in reality that's simply not the case.

About 120K stolen of 210K BTC total, 90K BTC left. Ballpark, not exact numbers.

It probably was 36% of the total amount of customer funds. It was more like 64% of the amount of BTC they had. It ends up at 36% because they are trying to socialize the losses among every asset class and all accounts.

Everyone wants answers, not empty replies. We would, for example, know if any of the major stakeholders (=balance holders) at BFX are going along with the management's rather desperate proposal to save the day with a "BFX coin" which would act like a bond that pays dividends based on BFX's profit.

You are now about to see exactly how many BTC are left under BFX's control at 35emx395afKAKAr72VoePVbu3FJvxLPVny and right now that number stands at 72.2k and it's rate of growth have slowed down a lot and we're now looking at a lot of smaller wallets being consolidated there.

If you just look at known customer assets and compare that to the amount of BTC stolen then the math does not add up for a 36% hair-cut.
BFX has to disclose exactly what liabilities (all customer assets are BFX liabilities, and this includes their newly created "BFX coin") they had before and after issuing this token of theirs. This is mandatory not optional. If they do not then it is safe to assume there is a reason they are hiding this information. I am sure a bankruptcy court and various police investigators can force them to provide this information if they do not do it voluntarily.

He is talking about the Skype conversations some shared excepts from on TradingView and Twitter. Please tell us more about how everyone can join in on those.

Why on earth would you just buy debt? Seriously? Obviously no investor is just going to buy a Debt Repayment Obligation. It's like.. I owe Some Guy $100. Would you be so kind enough to pay Some Guy the $100 for me because .. you like my hair? I am sure this works fine for young attractive women from time to time but you better be darn good looking and have a really sexy tight ass before anyone is going to pay a 119k BTC debt when it doesn't even involve a slim chance to bet some hot young thing.

The BTC situation is 210K BTC total, 120K stolen and 90K BTC left. The average socialized loss will therefore likely be north of 63%.That 63% number was just a work in progress guess, and individual losses will obviously depend on many factors such as what position(s) you had, what price(s), how much leverage you used and so forth. As to why Zane gives vague replies with no answers while management answers these questions privately is a good question.

Right now I am not able to login to BFX at all anymore. It asks me to enter my username and new password. Then I get to the 2FA page. When I enter that it just stops there, and nothing happens. This is not at my side as I've tried different browsers with clean profiles (no cache or cookies). I have login notifications enabled and I do get an e-mail saying "Successful Login" and details under " New login from your account:" which matches my browser ("device"), time and IP.

I too moved my haircut USD from the trading wallet to the exchange wallet. I too see 2x the amount in the "Exchange" wallet and 1x negative the amount in the "Margin Trading" wallet. The "Wallet" view is correct. This is clearly a system-wide bug which affects everyone who moved USD from one wallet to another.

Logic says that going with BitGone had little to do with the cftc since LTC essentially works like BTC and LTC wasn't put in anything like BitGo, neither was ETC or ETH for that matter.

Which begs the question: Since you didn't actually do this and everyone who knows how to look at the blockchain can plainly see that your claim that balances were settled once a day is false for a minimum of a week before the "hack" - does this means that trades that happened on Bitfinex but not on the blockchain are counted/seen as "valid" trades or not?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:05:56
Here is an actually factual quote you may consider: "63% is NOT the number - it's an estimate and frankly when we complete our analysis and everything is settled out, I think the haircut might be a bit higher - we are working very hard to sort it out in the most fair way possible."
It is pretty safe to say the haircut will be in the ballpark of 65-75%, not 15-25% or 40-50%.

The newly created BFX megawallet 35emx395afKAKAr72VoePVbu3FJvxLPVny as 90,208 btc.
The older wallet from their very old cold storage wallet has 33,388 in 39coweGgC8CPZ6hYL1BBEfc1zqbSfHsprW
This adds up to 123596 BTC. Since we've heard a 90 BTC number out of them unofficially I suspect they are considering pretending they don't have that 33388 BTC but that's not going to fly. It's interesting to note that 7k BTC was taken out of that address on 2016-07-27 which is when it appears the preparations for the "hack"/"security breach" started and it's interesting to note that most of those coins ended up being "stolen". 2016-07-27 also happens to be about the time BFX stopped doing actual settlements of trades for all accounts (when I noted this somewhere else here zane actually replied with "Not all trades are settled to the blockchain, the miner fees for something like that would be insanely high. And yes, anyone can check and see that their balance was settled daily." which would indicate that this mouth-piece tool has not actually looked and probably doesn't know how to do it - because those who have actually looked knows that this is simply on the case).
If you look at pastebin.com id 2XSASEEZ and you add them up you get 119756 BTC stolen.
This would indicate that about 49% of the BTC at BFX was emptied/"stolen". The obvious question is what percentage of total customer assets held this amounts to. BFX will have to present some clear and verifiable data on that if they want to try to keep going (which just won't happen, regardless of what zane claims it'll up to the bankruptcy court to figure these things out).

Nope, there are no fake screenshots going around, that's just a lie you like to use. I am not sure if you actually understand that you're lying yourself, though. They clearly don't tell you things and treat you like a puppet. You did, for example, claim that a screenshot of the conversation linked below was somehow "fake". That was a real conversation which did refer another real conversation - they just didn't tell you. If you look at the date then you'll quickly see that the scoop on the BFX token plan was shared privately with select people before anyone told you about it.

We already know for a fact that it's NOT given to all account holders.
Those few lucky US customers who had used SynapsePayment got their USD sent back 100% intact and a 36% haircut on their BTC holdings. These people ended up with total account haircuts ranging from 20-28% (from what people have admitted, it could be 0-36%).
**Everyone did NOT get the same haircut.**
I am not sure why someone with 50% USD and 50% BTC wouldn't get a larger haircut on their BTC if the USD could not be "haircut"/stolen because SynapsePayment had already locked Bitfinex out from their systems. It sure makes you wonder what the total amount of USD held by SynapsePayment on Bitfinex was.
