I agree this philosophy of holding peoples BitCoins is FRAUDULENT they use the time factor to create a pyramid the time they take to verify your account (allegedly) allows them to pay the guys who has been under verification for a long time so the loop continues and allows them to have a FREE FUNDS pool to spend on their personal endeavors which is very wrong and defeats the whole purpose of BitCoin as tool to empower people ANONYMOUSLY we are also in the fight against corrupt control of people. BitCoin is the way forward just like FREE energy it empowers people against greedy governments. My company has invented FREE energy it scared the U.S government so much that they shut down Liberty Reserve and stole over $2million USD in hard currency from me (All evidence is on our website) yes my company is the REAL reason they shut down Liberty Reserve we have invented FREE energy something they said in school was IMPOSSIBLE read more about it here  and  we are also about to make an IPO through a bank we believe has the balls to fight the U.S government and win visit  to buy shares in the biggest thing yet since the internet (YES BitCoins accepted) they also have REALISTIC investments to grow your BitCoins from 4.5% interest which is normal and realistic unlike HYIP that offers unrealistic non market indicative targets. Imagine an electric car that runs forever and never needs a recharge or run your home on FREE electricity and NEVER pay the energy companies again. We have started the revolution with OUR OWN money to prove that we are not profit seekers but freedom fighters. Check it out today and empower yourselves
