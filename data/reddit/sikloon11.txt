Been waiting for mine for 8 weeks, started asking for a refund, and they refused stating they would send another and I should try again in 6 weeks, also accused me of living in a P.O Box. Would not recommend them at all.

The Zimbabwe government is the author of its own misfortune, after taking land from its residents and printing as much money as they wanted and the country tanked. 
The current South African president and the ANC has started implementing policies that will make it possible to take land without paying for it. 
Many believe South Africa will end up like Zimbabwe if things do not change...
