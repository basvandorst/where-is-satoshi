Oh my god, what bullshit is this. Do you realise that when economists talk about savings, they imply matching amount of investment? That investment is source of growth. They do NOT mean that hoarding unproductive goods and currencies is source of growth...

US during Great Depression is often quoted as one, and in looser sense, all nations abandoned gold and silver standards because it simply couldn't meet their needs.
As for Austrian economics... my opinion is that it is not being taught in school/universities because it is not science, but an ideology. They are anti-government and pro-free market first, and then create economic models to fit their view. It is like saying that educational system is skewed towards current geologic models away from young earth.

Yeah, only a fool would think that their weath devalued by 70% because of civil war and Japanise invasion, it was abandoning the silver standard! True top mind

They are many critiques that are based in economic theory (I think that Austrians used to reject econometrics, but it may have changed in latest decades), and in my opinion (with full disclaimer that I am not scientific authority) I think that intentionally ignoring market failures and how they effect markets and welfare (like information asymetry, barriers to entry, natural monopolies, bargaining power etc.)is not very scientific. It is sort of like doing physics but refusing to acknowledge relevance of friction. They seem to base all their positions on moral views (that state is bad) which is also IMO a bit hypocritical as state is also only agent that is enforcing their property and contract rights, which they hold sacred.

Are all bitcoiners this financially illiterate?

Only if you "save" money by holding cash. If you invest, you are not "robbed by inflation".

Tech improves rapidly only in some sectors (IT, software, electronics) but slowly or not at all in others (real estate, food, clothing, most services). Sectors where technology grows slow amount to most of our consumption. 
Even then, it is actually possible that techology deflates prices right now, which is why inflation rates are low despite loose monetary policy and low unemployment. That is, we would have really bad deflation spiral without the ability to have expansionary monetary policy
