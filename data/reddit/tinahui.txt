Yes. Related to Bitcoin. We'll likely add an events calendar soon too. So folks can stay up to date on cool events around them. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY!!
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:04:32
Also, an update: Charlie Shrem is joining us as a featured guest. Wooo!
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:25:34
Thanks for the info! We taped a correction! :)

SWEETNESS and thanks! Come chat with us!
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:36:57
Am trying to make less and less cuts but also some people LOVE them. We'll mix it up and see what sticks. :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 22:21:38

@_date: 2014-09-14 23:34:40
Nice. The stories are hot again on Reddit! Wooo! :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:47:16
Yessir! :D 
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:47:27
OOPS! Apologies. Please try the link right above. Look forward to seeing you! Made a repost here as well: 
@_date: 2014-09-08 04:33:41
Ugh. Shady business folk with no sense of respect and decency are the worst.
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:35:47
This bitch is gettin' things done! Thanks for tuning in! :)
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:24:22
Oh nice. OOP! Didn't see the coverage. Though...this new ATM only accepts bitcoin and litecoin...not dogecoin too!! WOW! Where was this ATM? Is it still round? :D
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:48:29
Thanks! Will add it now. :)
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:04:46
Can you meet this weekend? I will be in NY and it would be great to connect. A bunch of us will likely be meeting also Sunday afternoon/early eve to discuss . Your experience will be very helpful.
@_date: 2014-09-16 06:29:15

Oh interesting. It probably will end up being more like that as the DFS is saying that there may be an extension and comment period on the revised draft of the BitLicense as well.
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:33:01
It's a top story on reddit atm! Just doing a summary of what's hot!  :D
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:16:15
Follow The Coin l&lt;3ves you! :)
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:56:51
True story. It's good to get the collective voices and thoughts heard. Else slavery may have just continued if those opposing slavery had remained silent? :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 23:43:33
Hi hi!
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:41:05
We did a bit of math, based on the DFS details  if everything goes as scheduled. 
- The BitLicense is on schedule to be published on or after: October 21, 2014
- Money 20/20: November 2-5, 2014
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:43:09
I was sick during filming of this video. Will do better next time. Thank you for your feedback. :)
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:54:19
Hahaha. I don't think Matthieu will be speaking to you for a while.
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:01:38
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:35:22
Ooh! That's killer. :)
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:03:03
YES! Email us please: team
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:01:07
There's also  :)
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:38:05
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:08:53
We're just trying to help get how the community feels out there instead of just speaking for people. Freedom to vote or not. Not forcing anything. Also those opposing slavery didn't have the internet. They did try voting as well as a civil war.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:37:22
News, Videos, Images, Chat, Links, Favorites and more! :) 
What would your ideal app do?
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:35:50
Thank you! Do come for a drink and then go back to work! :D
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:51:56
Possibly....here is a link to the eventbrite. Please invite anyone else you think may want to join! The clock is ticking!! 
@_date: 2014-08-25 11:47:54
Why thanks. :)
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:35:16
Beginning to think so too...though there are some good actors. Right?
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:50:18
Reaching out to some folks there too! :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:58:31
Thank you!! Come chat with us! :)
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:02:38
That's a great suggestion. I will add it to the invite! Thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-26 02:52:22
Sorry it took ages. Had to find a venue. :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:51:31
That's great feedback. Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:21:06

Perfect. Emailed you now. :)
@_date: 2014-10-22 07:39:50
Didn't have any. People who lie and take advantage are pet peeves.
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:33:19
Thank you!!!!
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:36:18
Thanks Matt. That's a great suggestion. Some found our songs too distracting...possibly there's a happy medium someplace. Definitely taking suggestions and testing things out. Happy to hear all feedback, throw paint on walls and see what sticks. :D
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:02:35

@_date: 2014-08-18 20:35:02
They will be SOON. :) 
Took Dish TV from May til now to implement. Let's start a timer. ;D
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:42:03
Apologies folks, but sometimes people we interview only want to answer questions in the way that they are comfortable answering without the details we all perhaps would like more of and sharing publicly and it was quite crowded on the CES floor. We are also a startup yet and are working on production! Thanks for bearing with us. The content and good work in the space is important...exciting times.
@_date: 2014-07-26 03:48:05
Sorry about the broken LINK here's the correct one: 
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:01:51
Go Andrew go!! :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:12:15
Yes! I'll be moderating. Thank you for asking. Hope you will be!
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:11:37
Nominations so far! 
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:32:06
So many thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:55:51
Agreed! He was prolific.
