Shhhh. You're ruining his time to shit on TOR!

If you keep your TOR security slider on high, use noscript, and be careful not to click untrusted links or download anything, you've eliminated like 95% of attack vectors.

I just wouldn't go selling Cheese Pizza. Regardless of the security of Tor...

That's like the exact opposite of a "very valid reason"

Fascinating reply old chap.

You blindly asserted that the very real fentanyl outbreak is the result of Bitcoin. You provided no evidence for the claim you made. Now you're asking me to prove that Bitcoin is not responsible. What are you seeking to gain from this conversation?

What's the difference in someone overdosing on Fentanyl they bought with bitcoin versus Fentanyl they bought with a euro or a dollar or a pound?  
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:32:36
Do you think that people buying and using fentanyl is something that came with people using bitcoin? That people wouldn't buy fentanyl if they didn't have bitcoin? People have been buying drugs for thousands of years, shipping them into this country for hundreds, and ordering them on the internet for decades. Bitcoin is a currency. If not Bitcoin they'll use Western Union and pesos. Jesus.

Much facts. Wow. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:32:33
So you think a majority of people who are overdosing on Fentanyl have personally purchased that fentanyl with Bitcoin? Or at some point someone imported that fentanyl into the country using bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:58:24
That is absolutely not what I said. Stop falsely summarizing my argument. My entire point is that Bitcoin isn't the reason there's fentanyl. If not Bitcoin, dollars. Dollars are inherently more anonymous than bitcoin. You are a troll. I have dedicated too much of my time to this. We're going in circles. This isn't a debate, it's a shouting match. Have a good one, bud. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:52:47
You're providing a Google search for people overdosing on Fentanyl coupled with bitcoin, then making the completely unsubstantiated claim that because several people use Bitcoin to buy fentanyl that Bitcoin is necessarily responsible for fentanyl overdose outbreaks. Just Bitcoin. No other societal factors. Just Bitcoin. Very nuanced argument. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:10:21
You are so kind. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:19:53
Since you didn't seem to grasp my question or point the last time you linked to a Google search I'll ask again. Why is it worse to buy fentanyl with Bitcoin than any other fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:49:26
Why would he be on an eternal list/warrant free search clause for using Open Bazaar or TOR?
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:30:16
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:21:19
But how is that related to bitcoin tho? You've never said why.

I've read reports in some of the more nefarious "bitcoin subs" about Coinbase closing accounts even after customer moved their coins to throw-away wallets before sending the coin to its ultimate destination. KYC and AML are not taken lightly by Coinbase.
