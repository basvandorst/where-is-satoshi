Dane here. Well, a couple of us actually do understand Bitcoin, but clearly our Central Bank does not. 
They also released a [longer report in Danish]( which has some quite peculiar statements. For instance (my translation): *Bitcoin can be hard to sustain in the long term since the computing power needed to mine Bitcoin has grown exponentially over the last 6 months. The growing expenses to computing power will presumably lead to a demand for higher compensation for mining Bitcoin. This could happen by an increased exchange rate or by higher transaction fees.*

The idea is that they use 2-of-3 multisig addresses where the customer holds one key, the bank the other and an external trusted entity (yet to be revealed) holds the third. The external entity will (hopefully) only provide the third key if people die.

This looks great! Two things I would like to see in an upcoming release which would make this really useful to me:
* Integration with iPhone contacts so you can just pick a friend and send coins
* Support for DKK (Danish Krone)

DKK: Thanks!! Appreciate it!
About the contact integration: Here in Denmark we have a very popular app called MobilePay, which allows people to send small and medium amounts of money directly and instantly from your own bank account to your friends bank account, even if it is a different bank. It is free, works with all Danish banks and more than 1/3 of all smartphone users in Denmark have the app, last I checked!! 
It is dead simple to use and one key feature is that it integrates with the iPhone contact list. So that is what you are up against here :) But Hive only needs contact integration, then it would be in the same class. It already has the nice layout and user friendliness.

I just registered and got the "Welcome to OneName" email which includes a backup code. Do I understand this correctly: You keep a backup code which, combined with the backup code in the email, can recreate my secret key...?
So if you are hacked, including your email systems (sent emails), all passphrases will be compromised? Or what am I missing?

.. or if the bank fails completely, then people can get their money out by help of the external entity.

If you really understand why gold is valuable, then you should also be able to understand why Bitcoin is valuable, because Bitcoin has the exact features that make gold valuable:
- scarce
- impossible to counterfeit
- durable
On top of that, Bitcoin can easily, quickly and cheaply be moved across the world, which is more than you can say about gold. And it is a lot easier to divide in small pieces. Bitcoin is kind of "digital gold", really.

As a Dane, I am ashamed
