You must be new here.. Have you checked the crypto currency market capitalizations lately? Dogecoin has been one of the top 8 altcoins for the better part of the year.

No problem! Head on over to and find out :)

I was the best man at one and the usher at the other. Both were first cousins of mine that got hitched. So yes, there is a bit of entitlement. Am I resentful? No.

His attitude is exactly what pushes so many people away from this community.

Am I late!?

Thanks! How do I collect? I have a coinbase account but I'm not sure how to link it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:42:35
Thank you. I've been to 2 weddings this month and didn't get shit. Be fucking grateful.

Coins generated. I also bought the GHS cheaper than the price I sold it.

New to Bitcoin! Any kind gesture would be greatly appreciated. I have .20 cents in Bitcoin so far! Haha.

So ridiculous. I can't believe it. Who would ever do such a thing?

How do you figure they'll never get it back. I used Ghash at one point and was able to pull out with a decent profit
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:51:33
Actually no, I didn't. Both weddings were conservative. No drinking or dancing. I'm a little shit for telling people to be grateful? It was a great wedding and I'm not upset about it. Calm your tits.

Thank you. Pretty sick of seeing articles that have absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin posted here. 
"Florida man shot in the back of the head by ex girlfriend! Could've been avoided if boyfriend used Bitcoin!"
