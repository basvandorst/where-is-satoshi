But you are not talking about "a society" banning it. A society wield to power of banning. It wields the power of shaming and discouraging, but you're talking about banning.
Banning is something that requires the power of government, which is not the same as society. Society is "everyone". Government is "some". Even if you assume democracy, government is still reduced to the 50% most powerful, in a best case scenario that is rarely the case. In a representative democraticv system it is much much lower.
Don't speak of "society" when you clearly mean "the elites in charge".

Why allow people who are wrong at all? Anyone who says something that is wrong provides no benefit to society. Clearly it is detrimental to society when incorrect things spread. Similarly, why allow people who are immoral to spread their immoral viewpoints, and also, people who are obviously delusional, for example who have a ludicrous metaphysical views of the Universe, should not be allowed to promote those ideas. Ludicrous ideas do not benefit society.
In other words, why "allow" incorrect political, religious, ethical or false ideas at all? How do these benefit society?
...what... ? Who gets to define what ideas are incorrect, immoral etc? Why, the same people who gets to define "conspiracy theories" in your argument, of course!
(To clarify, because sarcasm is sometimes misunderstood here: I am being sarcastic above. It is not for you or someone else to "allow" what theories are to be spread).

Also, it is easy in retrospect to see what points you should sell (and buy) at. "Why didn't you sell at 19k and buy at 6k you dumb fool!" is easy to say.

But at the same time the tripple check is also a double check of the 2nd check, so, being simultanously a tripple check and a 2nd double check, qualifies as concluding the sequence of checks.

Seriously - who thinks "Gee I want a cup of coffee at Starbucks, but paying for it is such a hassle, I'll just have tap water instead.".
Bitcoin is vastly superior for online payments, especially cross border ones. When we got that market locked down, maybe perhaps one day it will make more sense for a cup of be paid with bitcoin too, but that's the last step, not the first.
Bitcoin solves many problems. How to pay for a cup of coffee isn't one of them, because it isn't a problem in the first place.

Yes and no. Lightning is for payments, not storage. In my mind "wallet" is something you use for payments. Like your physical leather wallet. Or checking account. That's where you keep your liquid money for daily payments. Hopefully this is where Lightning will excel. It is what it is made for. If Lightning works out, there will be no need for proprietary custodial wallets, although I do realize many banks and companies will want to sell it anyway.
The second need is for safe long term storage, your savings account. You are right that safe and easy solutions will need to be developed for mainstream. Maybe banks will be involved for some people - I wouldn't trust my grandma handle a Trezor. Either way, hopefully those solutions will give you more control over your money than current day banks allow. Multisig is a wonderous thing, and there will be a big role for safe yet privacy and control enabling solutions.

You forget NASDAQ and tech stock dropping across the board last couple of months. As much as we all like to think of bitcoin as similar to gold, and there is some merit to that, the truth of the matter is that the market treats it more like a tech stock, valued entirely based on potential profits in the future (like tech startups, it has a P/E of infinity due to zero earnings), a future linked to massive worldwide adoption. 
When tech companies are taking a beating, it is not surprising to see bitcoin do the same. At times strong bitcoin sentiments - moon or burst - will gain their own dynamic and overrule outside trends. But in a lull, such as the one we saw previous to the drop below 6000, those outside trends may decide what direction bitcoin will take next. 
Then once the floor is breached, the trader dynamic takes over again.

Cash is also BOTH a medium of exchange and a store of value. Fiat cash hasn't been a great store of value over long periods of time, obviously, but short term and even medium term it is what it has been used as. If it wasn't a store of value, it could not function as a medium of exchange. You can't have one without the other.

Now you are shifting the goalposts. We were discussing the value of one Euro in the future, not whether Europe can expect prosperity in the future. That's a completely different subject matter.
It is your literacy that is questionable if you are unable to stick to the subject without drifting to some general subject and then complaining that I do not understand that general subject even though I have not even delved into that subject in my posts. Moving the goalposts like that is pure intellectual dishonesty on your part. Either intellectual dishonesty or you are simply unable to follow an intellectual argument on a subject.
The subject matter was whether 1€ is a stable store of value over time. It is not.
The fact that inflation and economic growth may create new wealth elsewhere in the economy is irrelevant for that discussion. My 1000 € will still evaporate over time due to inflation, regardless whether OTHER money may be made elsewhere in the economy. That makes it a poor store of value. If you do not understand that distinction, then you are suffering from financial illiteracy.
