Futures are crap. They are cash settled so arent linked to Bitcoin. All this hype doesn't make sense. Institutional investors may try to influence the price but F* them, let them play in their futures pool, ignore their price and let's run the Bitcoin show ourselves.

@_date: 2017-11-11 03:16:19
Bitcoin advertises itself as a fast and low fee payment system. Check the website and promo materials. It used to be true but no anymore. So to new people this is misleading. Also, it cant be really adopted by businesses and go truly mainstream because transactions are too slow and way more expensive than visa.

Is Visa using 1MB data batches? I'm pretty sure their data stream is huge, hence if you want to compete with leading payment systems, 1MB doesn't make much sense. Market understands that and hence we see big movements today.

Dilusional.. The news outlets reported that chinese gov are banning exhanges because they dont benefit  blockchain tech but instead are used for price manipulation, scams, icos  etc and also threaten yuan. So to them there s no point in having exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:15:50
It happens all the time. Happened when btc went to 4k and bounced to 4.7k. Now went to 2.9k bounced to 3.6k. Thats normal. Can't expect it to freefall indefinitely. It will go up and down. But the trend is clear. :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:08:31

Is this miner news speculation or legit?
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:52:06
Correction to $2300 was overdue even without any negative news since btc went too high too quick. Exponential growth in price isn't sustainable. Add bad news from china to the mix and it could go down lower than $1900.

@_date: 2017-09-15 11:08:20
Natural correction could go to $2300 however we have significantly bad news from china so this could drag it further down. No one knows since the china ban is a new territory. That said, the actual trend line is around $1550, so it would be reasonable to buy in that range.

Tricky situation if you just have digital monopoly money and can't cash btcs out when needed. Also remember that china isnt a regular country, they have stricter controls.

Just wait couple more days and you may be selling it at a loss yourself. If you think that this is over, you are naive. It s a likely bull trap which allows chinese to sell at a better price. Also they have more time now to sell i.e. 45 days so no instant dump since they would lose alot of money.

These are some of the reasons for banning exchanges as reported by media outlets which many people called "fake news" and for that reason they must be 30pc down now. So be aware of HOLDR, BUY THE DIP etc posts and do your own analysis before investing. It will be volatile.

Trade digital monopoly money? Where is the real world application in china? They would have to find foreign suppliers which would accept speculative btc and pay for the physical goods. Remember that china is the  exporter. What is more we are talking about regular chinese citizens and not a coordinated trade scheme in btc.

The number of silly posts are over the top now. It s like people getting desparate or smth. Should focus on the technology, how it can be improved and how it can change the industry rather than talk about HODL, Moon and call every negative news fake. P.s. it s not fud calling china ban correctly.

Imo it wont moon that high. The ceiling for now is 4.9k. Without exciting news, it shouldn't go past it. It should retract. Plus fork is upcoming and btc needs a healthy correction to its trend line coz we dont want it to overheat and crash extremely badly. So we ll see, either way it will be fun :)
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:40:52
Yes if you wait for the official statement and dont buy the hype at 4.5k, you can buy loads more at 3k

Pretty tired of those silly posts like: HOLDR, MOON, FAKE NEWS ABOUT CHINA BAN (which is 100% true), SOLD HOUSE FOR BTC, J. DIMON IS BAD  etc. They bring no value to the conversation but instead make this whole thing look like a ponzi scheme where everyone tries to persuade other people to buy btc, drag them in with their stupid posts and missinformation just to pump the price... Btc is a great technology so don't make the community behind it look bad by publishing silly posts.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:05:42
Yes, alot of people are downplaying the news as fake however this news is real. The statement is that chinese exchanges will be closed because according to the gov they are used for illegal activities such as significant price manipulation, fake volumes, systematic scams, money laundering, risky icos etc. They aren't banning bitcoin per se but rather exchanges which can convert btc into cny and vice versa. So effectively chinese people won't be able to cash out their btc, hence the sell off.

There you go all naive people who didn't believe it and published silly posts denying the news. It was obvious it s gonna happen since several respected people in crypto confirmed it. The moment of truth is incoming. Remember that btc will be fine long term however it s overdue a significant  correction. In other words, the chart cant go vertical, it s unsustainable, hence correction is healthy.

Stating BCH =  CSW is wrong. It's just different philosophy since BCH supporters think that larger blocks are the answer to scaling issues and therefore lead to fast transactions, low fees and ultimately visa-like adoption by businesses.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:16:14
