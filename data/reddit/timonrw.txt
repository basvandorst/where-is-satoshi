Important notice: platform maintenance​In order to improve our services and make your Wirex experience even better, we’re carrying out some necessary maintenance on the platform.  
Unfortunately, this means we’ve had to make some temporary changes to your account until the work is complete.​What’s changed?​Bank transfer infrastructure is under maintenance. **This means that bank transfers IN and OUT of your account are temporarily suspended.**   
There are **two exceptions**. You can still transfer GBP in and out of your Wirex account using Faster Payments and you can still transfer EUR into your account by SEPA and Swift – but not out.  
All other features like your Wirex Visa card and exchange services are not affected.
