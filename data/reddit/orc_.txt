The only reason why bitcoin still growing is because all newcomer are investing in coinbase and the like, they won't move the coins anytime soon, so they got no fees to play with for now.

Check out the situation WhollyHemp had, he added bitcoin payment and conversions went down, psychologically adding more payment methods reduces conversions.
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:43:34
1.- Most people don't even know what bitcoin is.
2.- Most people do know what credit cards are.
3.- Putting both credit card payments and BTC will make you lose money because adding too many payment options reduces conversions.
ANSWER: NO, ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS.

So I visited that subreddit and I was convinced, btc is no longer sustainable with those fees, what's your argument, haven't seen any.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:43:12
Price locked to what? The US dollar? Think about that for a second, doens't make sense, it's like "price locking" a currency.
But yeah, bitcoin is done for as the "people's currency", any other alt can do that job.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:51:42

1.- Bitcoin will not go 10x, there is no "potential" if there is give me a reference to somebody important who knows what he is talking about saying that bitcoin can go increase 10x price in the following years.
2.- Even if it did it would still be nearly impossible to cash out, show me a service that can send me $10,000+ to my bank account . There is none, I can only cashout like $100 daily, which will take like a holw fuckign YEAR!

You literally just said it is immoral to eat dogs because they are great tools, not for a moment you said "they are sentient beings with a personality and feeling", oh no.


I'll grant you that point that they don't value something like that, but your anti animal rights stance is still as immoral as it is based on valueing animals in a selfish way, "*What can this creature do for ME*?" , try thinking, what if no animal owes shit to any human?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:55:59


Why are we talking about biology again?


Racial one? What, maybe you mean natural one? Still, appeal to nature.
I wonder when guys like you will finally value dogs for being sentient beings with preferences, feelings and interests? Oh no you gotta value them from some sort of biological perspective, utility and place in society, very sociopathic ideals you have.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:08:23
What is your premise anyway? Guy above says dog eating is bad because of their social utility and then you chime in saying eating dogs is bad because "DNA" and social utility.
I wonder if you are terrified of admitting you love dogs because they're living beings that show love, compassion, intelligence and self-awareness, but that would mean killing and eating pigs is also wrong, so you can't do that, no, you have look at it carefully and think hard some bullshit reason why dogs get special treatment.
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:38:50
lil bitches, you know them, they're purists.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:45:50
You just repeated the exact same stuff the guy above wrote... TLDR: Dogs are useful and I value them for what they give to ME ME ME.


Oh we going into social contract now? Well hear this, under social contract, if a society deems acceptable to kill and eat dogs, IT IS acceptable.

And you are blissfully naive to even believe such unproven, fantasies.
Just the word "Blissfully unaware" makes me thing you are extremely idiotic, like if you somehow already know based on your lurking that some sort of utopia is close even though we can barely afford to keep our economies standing.
