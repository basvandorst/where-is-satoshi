THIS. Clearly, this. I quite understand the frustration but here, a little experience would have helped. You cannot go into business so easily, and also, never, EVER think something is gonna go OK and you can start counting on this. 
Remember, that every hitech venture is highly risky, and most projects fail.

This analogy does not work either. It's not a tool. You don't build shit with it. It's a fucking weapon. Designed to kill, not to hunt. 
Also, your numbers are incorrect. check that out.

see my answer further on: if your job is to provide security, you dont rely on a 3rd party lib which license does not give any warranty without proper testing. It's fucking ridiculous for a text input that should only receive numerics not to fire a validation error upon "$[0-9]{7}^"
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:15:36
Yes they should. However format validation should be tested. Also, authy PROVIDES FUCKING 2 STEP VALIDATION. It's mission critical to them. If you PROVIDE security, you dont leave it to a 3rd party lib which license states "THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND"
