You can buy things with it - but it’s just more expensive than we want. That’s different than not being able to buy things at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:19:25
Lmao! 
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:24:51
it's very hard to spend or even get people to pay me using it. There's too much risk in even owning bitcoin. That is the current biggest problem.

What’s the best wallet on iPhone? 
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:40:17
is bitcoin cash that bad? For me, I am having trouble finding a lot of opportunities to spend/get paid using either (just hodling everything atm). In my facebook group (crypto sales usa) - I promote like 4-5 cryptos just because it seems like I'm casting a wider net.

Thank you friend

Thank you friend

Lmao. That guy running across the country seems a little suspicious. Any videos or pics from throughout the run? 32 miles a day would also do quite a number on his joints, especially for someone who isn’t already
Conditioned. Not completely discrediting him - but it’s definitely suspect
@_date: 2019-06-07 22:01:44
It's not virtue signaling, the crypto also distinguishes this project. The actual pictures of the homeless with QR codes is so unusual that it draws attention and more donations which help feed them for longer. Also, I would rather not have an organization like paypal just lock the wallets at their whim. 
In addition to that, we are also unique in that we deliver the food by hand in person straight to the homeless. We are not and will never be a shelter/soup kitchen. Most homeless people never utilize those services for various reasons!
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:16:47
I am sorry to hear that you're homeless but one thing you need to understand is that not every homeless person is a high functioning person like yourself.
A LOT of them are suffering from addiction and are homeless likely because of that. Also a lot of them have physical/mental issues that prevent them from going to kitchens and shelters. This is common. Bringing them food is an effective way to cover those who aren't getting fed otherwise. I am not trying to replace shelters!
@_date: 2019-06-05 18:59:37
this trip was from a volunteer, but noted. I will get some bottled water for my next trip out.
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:58:16
we are giving food - delivering it actually straight to them. Check the website out - I do not think you read anything on the image that I posted...
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:52:42
I just read through most of that Jason king thread. He had an overhead of 90% on his charity? Meaning only 10% of the money actually made it to the homeless? Wtf. 
Building a sanctuary and paying a mortgage that depended on bitcoin was probably the stupidest thing he did.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:23:41
No. We don’t rent anything and have no overhead. We take our time donating a few meals a week and only if the funds are there. Sean’s outpost seems like they set themselves up to fail if the price crashed because of how much overhead they had and bad management of the funds.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:32:20
Completely agree

never fails to make me chuckle. friends don't let friends bitmex.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:05:12
The food programs are kitchens that a lot of homeless don’t use for various reasons. We go to the homeless directly - this is an important difference. If you’re interested in starting your own program - do it!!!
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:50:00
that made me laugh - have an upvote
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:15:58
All these people getting fed and that’s what you got out of this?
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:45:16
I am recording the price of the crypto at the time of donation and relative fiat value. I am paying the fiat price of food (and getting as cheap food as possible from the groceries as of now). Even if the crypto price tanks, I WILL PAY THE RECORDED VALUE out of fiat. (All of this is on a spreadsheet on my site)
next: you aren't seeing this the right way in my opinion. MOST of the homeless people that are on the street are NOT using any form of charity. They either don't know any better, or are not physically/mentally able to do it. Also there are those who are struggling with addiction/drug use and get kicked out of shelters as a result of that. 
We are delivering food straight to these people - as far as I know, there are not many people doing this. Heck, not enough people care about homeless people enough to do it. They just set up a shelter/kitchen and wait for the homeless to come to them which may not happen. 
Then there's the issue of where the donation money goes in those charities - I am willing to bet that there is a huge amount of waste from overhead, rent, paying for things that don't get used, etc. Crypto for the homeless only uses the donated funds on FOOD. There are no labor fees, gas fees, or anything. Literally 100% of it is used on the food which is immediately delivered. We have reserves saved up to keep going for a little while now. 
This is NOT about efficiency or solving homelessness. There are actual human beings out there living the worst days of their lives, feeling like nobody gives a shit about them. Having an actual person coming up to you and handing you food can be HUGE for someone in that dark place. I don't know if this is really selling you on the idea of this, but regardless it is spreading very fast. If you don't like the idea, I can respect that, but I think I definitely made it clear what makes us stand apart from normal charities.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:19:20
you can volunteer to buy and handout food in your city and I will reimburse you in crypto (as long as you photograph everything as well as I did on my site). 
The internet is a harsh place, when I first started this so many people came out of the gutters of reddit to criticize me and call it a scam. Regardless, we are doing very well - let me know if you're interested!
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:47:50
true that. I guess there's some incentive for a volunteer to buy food if they really want to convert their cash into btc.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:09:37
Upvoted. This is not ok!!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:29:36
I’m using the unusual nature of the pictures to get more homeless people fed. I’m keeping track of all donations and expenses on the site. You sure are missing the forest for the trees here, way to completely ignore the large amount of homeless that have been fed and will continue to get fed.
The site literally has pictures of 50 homeless people getting fed with all expenses accounted for and recorded and the best you have to say is "hurr the name sux0rs". Stop trolling kid.
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:28:25
I am currently scaling this by recruiting volunteers in other areas. I already have 3 so far that I reimbursed using crypto. I’ve posted some threads 2 days ago looking to see if more people in other places would be willing to go out and had a decent amount of people reach out. Look forward to seeing those posts added to my site (I’ll also post them here).
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:28:53
This is exactly what bitcoin is for. If you like it donate - if not then don’t. Good job with the art!
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:03:52
No, the wallets belong to me. I record the equivalent amount of crypto donated at the exact time of donation, and record it on my site. Then I spend my own money to buy or prepare food for the homeless (all expenses and donations recorded on the site). Check it out!
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:56:20
the homeless people aren't using crypto, we are giving them FOOD. the crypto goes to my wallets (I record the amount and value of all donations and expenses - there is 0 waste, 100% of the funds are used only on food that is given to the homeless - check my website there is a spreadsheet documenting it all).
You literally didn't even read the text in the picture before making your response lol.
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:53:12
Send it to  on telegram
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:23:35
Like what you did there. I appreciate any support!
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:11:41
they may never even go pick them up is why. A lot of homeless have many barriers that you may never even have considered (physical limitation, mental limitation, no desire to travel, addiction, etc). By bringing the food straight to them, I think it is the best way.
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:05:57
They need food period.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:38:44
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:12:47
this is everyone LOL.

send me a PM - I have a telegram
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:41:19
Lol can I see some links to what you’re talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:45:05
please explain
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:57:22
absolutely not. They are receiving food and then asked if it's ok to pose for a picture because the food was from donations through the internet and the picture would help us continue doing what we are doing (they almost always say yes because they love the idea). Go to the website and check out the documentation of all our trips!
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:14:11
I'm afraid of what this subreddit will become that day. I will be posting many memes.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:32:42
Are you talking about the homeless people?
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:35:15
yes, it works exactly as you said. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:34
holy shit! So, now's a good time to buy right?
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:58:46
yeah, that seemed strange to me too. It's close to like... 80% dip from 2020 to 2021.
@_date: 2019-06-06 03:54:51
me paying for my own gas/labor is not a problem - I am doing this right after my clinic ends in philadelphia, which is REQUIRED for my pharmacy education (meaning I was going to be driving to this location no matter what). I assume most of the volunteers are also doing the same. The time is something we willingly give up for the project - again no big deal. I did google this extensively before, and also clicked your link - it brings up a HUGE amount of soup kitchens and shelters. Not one result on the front page is of a charity that brings food for the homeless, my point still stands. I am sure there are some out there - but they are for sure the extreme minority. Just look at the homeless on the street as you walk by them, every single one of them could use some food delivered to them - this shouldn't even be something we are debating. 
And again you are free to disagree and donate or not to whatever charity you want!
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:08:46
Addict or not, I don't think anyone should starve. Just my personal view on this.
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:04:09
I think you want a lot from them, which is fine. I want them to succeed too, but I also want them to have their immediate needs taken care of and make their "now" just a bit better. Quitting smoking is actually quite difficult, the withdrawal symptoms alone stop 97% of the people who attempt to quit. Nobody is perfect, you're free to be hard on them, but I personally will continue to help them if I am able to.
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:06:07
I'm not giving them money - if you take a look at the website, you can see that I am providing them with food and water only.
@_date: 2019-04-30 13:57:28
She did break her hand and we had to pay over $2000 in dr and hospital bills. I borrowed some cash from a friend and sold many things on eBay, let go, and Facebook to cover the costs (as well as dumping the majority of my paycheck). I paid my friend back as well. The crypto was just something I wanted to give a try since I am an enthusiast. I provided proof with pictures on the website for this, and the go fund me i made for the homeless is even linked there. That was how I wanted to try to help them at first but nobody really showed interest. I get the skepticism but... you can clearly see that I actually went out and spent the small amount of donations on food for the homeless. There will be more coming later this week.
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:09:20
If you do not want to help the homeless, I can respect your decision.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:44:43
never used localbitcoin so far, but you mean in terms of how people are essentially turning their food donation into bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:47:32
it was the best I could do at the time because of the parking in Philly
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:07:29
I absolutely will. My intentions are good, but a lot of this is a learning experience
@_date: 2019-04-29 22:27:44
If you ended up on the street and were suffering every day, I would gladly come and give you a meal.
@_date: 2019-04-14 05:18:07
All of it at the moment
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:10:35
For 0 confirmation stuff - use bitcoin cash. Normally though, the mempool would not be this congested. A huge amount of hashing power switched to bitcoin cash because of the hash war. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:58:22
and to clarify - I understand more or less how a fork works, and about the ABC vs SV battle going on. I was just unclear about the timing of this sort of thing.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:50:42
same question. I store my bitcoin in a wallet, how do I retreive the new currency?
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:30:54
Damn, when is the next dip? Gonna buy huge this time 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:31:42
So no matter the method I use to... secure my bitcoins... they will ALWAYS be in the block chain? It’s just the address and method of retrieval that will change?
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:40:05
Hey guys, I got a ton of useful info from here and invested a nice amount in bitcoin thus far. I recently made an account on bittrex and was looking to make some more purchases but I noticed that they said they only allow wire transfers to purchase bitcoin with a minimum of 10,000. Is this for real? Anyone who uses this site - are you really wiring over 10K at a time? And what is the best compromise in terms of reliability, low fees, and speed I can get for bitcoin exchanges? (i live in the US)
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:32:51
interesting. How does the adoption go down like that? Surge of new users making non-segwit wallets?
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:00:34
awesome, made my own store just now! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:14:09
We are all satisfied 
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:46:01
I meant in terms of where the coins are being stored... when they are transferred from coinbase to trezor, they still remain on the block chain, and simply get assigned a new address that trezor creates? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:11:40
Greatly appreciate the response. So my next question is: if I move over to using a trezor wallet, I know I have to use their website to authorize transactions. Going from coinbase to trezor, my bitcoins are remaining in the ledger but my address is changing? And I’ll be responsible for inputting my private key instead of relying on coinbase to do it for me? Is this all correct or do I have something wrong?
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:55:01
I’ve been doing a lot of research this past week and have a small amount of bitcoin on coinbase. I’m going to invest in a trezor wallet today, but was curious about a few things. When I’m using coinbase, are my bitcoins stored on their servers? Or are the bitcoins just part of the large block chain/network and coinbase is able to identify a small piece as mine? When I use the trezor wallet, where are the bitcoins stored exactly? From what I understand, the main use of the wallet is to protect my private key, and not to store the coins? In terms of the actual mechanics of how to do it all - I get it. But I’m more curious about where the coins are exactly. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:13:41
will trezor support bitcoin gold? Where are you guys storing your bitcoin to prepare for this coming fork?

just buy and hold as much as you comfortably can - then profit. It's as easy as that.

Skipped all of that. Just bought bitcoin, held, bought more, held, bought more held... Am fucking rich now. lol
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:54:14
Of course! Any questions are welcome.
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:01:35
lmao. I am just holding the crypto and spending fiat for now - I think that converting to btc is a good idea but like 99% of my crypto is already btc.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:17:14
yeah i will, although I am not sure if that is how most homeless people end up homeless.
