In what world is that preferable? Do you actually want to go back to feudalism?

Even if that was actually a true statement, do you honestly believe a purely profit driven entity would not enslave you given the chance?

That's Godwin's law you stupid sucker of a chump who is dumb.

You don't even know what insurance is? Seriously?

Because it's already failed and it's hilarious to watch it happen.

I feel like people like you didn't pay much attention to the parts in your history classes where they talked about what unregulated companies did to people. You would not be paying less for the protection of a company that has the power to kill you with no repercussions than you do to the government.

If you're paying someone to protect you, you're a peasant and they're the noble. Especially in a world without regulation where THEY set the price on your life.

Are you guys indicating what your comment scores have been multiplied by?

Theoretically, yeah, he could do any of those things, but he could do all of those normally.
Except mining, but then again, he couldn't mine a bitcoin either. No one can casually mine, really, at this point.
I'm definitely not going to disagree that pretending to tip someone something is obnoxious and petty, though. Hooray, he wasted three minutes of someone's time, at most. Good job.

Six comments down in dyerfelfire, there's a link. Later, there's a bunch of long posts with tons of links in them. You don't need to lie to make him look stupid.

He has to pay for the bitcoin to give it to you. You do realize that there's a difference between something being free and something being a waste of time, right?

This is bizarre. First you say he could have feasibly mined a bitcoin (he can't) and now you say he never could have (he could have when difficulty was lower)
