Actually Verizon has pretty damn good coverage all across the country, especially in the non-urban areas... I get 4g or AT LEAST 3g almost everywhere I go, and this is in rural Pennsylvania where you can be hours from any major city.

People get shot over 200 drug deals that go wrong.  I am only asking an honest question.  This guy is from NY so its not exactly a secret who he is or where he is from.   You steal 20,000 bucks from the wrong person, you're gonna have a bad time......

I was hoping to get in when the price was around 50 right before it went down.

Jesus christ, I just deposited 1200 a few MINUTES ago, and now they are down... somebody please reassure me that this site will come back up and my money will be safe.  I am 2 step authed so I am not worried about my account in particular, just the site as a whole and its deposit mechanisms.

I said that people stand to lose... judging by his track record relating to the last "hacking" and whatnot he may not give all of the money back this time either.  Also some people currently have $10,000 or a lot more tied up in this whole bullshit episode.  I am anxiously awaiting to see how this pans out.

You seriously better have mt.gox 2 step authe'd or you are retarded (with crazy parents and that amount of BTC.)  Best of luck to your situation though!
