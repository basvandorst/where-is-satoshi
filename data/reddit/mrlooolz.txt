Cool thanks will check it out! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:39:40
Yeah this needs to be higher. I want to see what their cuc PR guy will say.
I use bitstamp. Very slow but they respond and I get my money always
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:45:18
Will check it out as well. Thanks mate
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:32
Where can i get it?

LONG TIME HODLER here. To be honest this climb is making me uncomfortable. I feel like the recovery to this price will be hard after a hard burst. I also believed that it should have a long time commercial prospect not just store it. If it is just about storing money then it wont ever be stable with out something backing it up? Not sure and would love to get some unbiased opinion here.

I am not greedy you just assumed how much i have. I actually use a nice website and withdraw at every mile stone.

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:02
no that much :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:54:39
I dont really want to trade it. I have a moon target.

Magi is a great anime. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:31:33
I did check it out and super cool. Do you know one that will just show the price and takes up one icon space? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:21:47
Okay, i think my statement was rash. I do know i need to do more reading. I took c++ in uni and I can follow coding language as I wrote script luas when i played ffxi. Thanks for taking the time to inform me. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:22:09
Yeah. I see a problem with this. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:22:37
New user. Care to elaborate or have a resource i can read? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:44:58
Yes. However I can't buy and trade it since I cant verify payments on most exchanges. I do get the jist of what you are syaing though. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:17:34
Yeah my coins are with me offline. would I have the also move my b2x coins when they are issued? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:21:45
What does it matter about the miners though? If we transact on Bitcoin they will have to mine bitcoin. That logic seems very normal to me compared with. I will trade in different currency because they mine in that currency? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:17:00
Which guy? Also is there an ELI5 About replay protection. Who ever it is he has the right to an opinion. I want all the data to make an informed decision. 
Replay protection will not allow me on which chain to transact. Meaning if i buy nome BTC they might end up as b2x and I dont have a choice? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:18:14
Yay more homework! Thanks will have to go over a bunch of this. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:43:51
Okay. I do. Maybe you would share some resources?
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:12:57
Well if I run a full node, would i be able to chose. Pfft humans always want to ruin things. We are just substituting bankers with miners? 
So its just a matter of who holds out the most. History tells us, it will be users to jump first. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:16:19
Thanks fellow friend! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:35:03
Will do. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:51:11
Not sure if you are being sarcastic. I cannot for the life of me detect tones over script. i did not mean to offend but I do like to question. Thanks for your input:)
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:48:51
Nice. Good for him. pioneering a term is more than I could say I have done :P
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:42:13
Okay I did the reading. So I run a node. That seems beneficial in the community and my self. I think I will do that. 
Regarding my coins on my trezor. Id rather keep them there than on the BitcoinCore wallet. That would be okay too, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:30:21
Yeah but this sounds like you are doing propaganda. I want to do it with a simpler language. Imagine you are convincing your father who is not tech savy what to do. What would you say? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:48:34
My Bitcoins are going to fork into segwit2x coins? I am in the middle east. We dont even have Bitcoin cash yet. Id like to stay with Bitcoin core. I have no regrets buying at all but it is getting very intimidating :/
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:24:28
This i like. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:18:28
If they do implement. Does the argument exponentially grow in their favor. If so then I see no reason why the dont. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:18:51
Thanks for your time then :) 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:06:10
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:50:23
I see. 
Miners are strong arming us to move into a new chain because there is less for them to make on the old chain. That does not sound like decentralized
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:20:03
If we all run nodes it doesn't allow miners alot of power, correct? 
Edit: some good info below. Be sure to check it out. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:17:34
Yeah my coins are with me offline. would I have the also move my b2x coins when they are issued? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:15:47
Interesting. How do you respond to the claim by others that alot of the signatories will pull out when they understand the full on extent of segwit2x. That they were infact misinformed? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:48:45
I just bought your device. What is the first thing I should do before moving my BTC into it?
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:33:06
Oh and run full nodes! If need to know how read this:
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:26:46
As a new user, I read plenty. The reason I chose to stay with core was because we determine the price and the chain not the miners. Thats my simple version. Add to it no replay protection and the way segwit2x is approaching this (with hostility) as opposed to BitCash is why I mad my opinion very damn fast. 
I am not rushing into a decision. I am making an informed one while trying to validate by having a discussion here. I ask because I want to get ahead of the curve. :/
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:42:59
Okay. Can you explain hodl to me ? I tend to see it in many places.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:46:48
The miners on the segwit2x chain are mining full blocks? As user I would want to stay eventually the miner would leave the chain with no transactions and come to the one with the users still transacting? I get that it would be slow but just need to stay strong.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:34:03
I understand. Will need to look up splitter device. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:23:33
Cool thanks. I dont have much plus geographically. I can only trade on bitstamp so ill have to see. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:52:10
Cool thanks
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:01:42
Its not gambling to some of us who believe it will be the currency of the future and we will function on it. Just had the same damn argument with my dad.
You fly from the USA to the uk you make an exchange for  currency to use it.
If you are treating it as stock then fine. But Please don't say gambling. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:42:37
is this a good node, or do you technically need slightly better hardware?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:43
Copy Paste from somewhere else.:
If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.






 &gt; Check out this great articles and video: 
  


  


 


    






























































*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.* 
Edit: Bitcoin.org is the legit Bitcoin site. Stay away from fake "Bitcoin" stuff like r/"btc", "Bitcoin".com, Bcash ("Bitcoin" Cash/BCH), "Bitcoin" Gold, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:12:40
I'm a little confused. My coins on Trevor are on an account. I moved them out of legacy but into a normal account that has segwit support. If i am with core. Should i move these coins back into legacy?
Been told multiple times its okay, but i still panic. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:20:46
My pleb 66 yr old dad who doesn't know how to use a pc has asked me to buy him a Trezor and coin. Services to help will come up and its not hard.
The community continues to work together because we have a collective interest to protect ourselves.
Sorry but i don't agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:22:56
I run a node but how do I use it to ensure i am on the bitcoin chain? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:23:50
So I checked. My local exchange only deals with BTC and ETH and the only exchange my country is allowed to exchange on internationally is Bitstamp. Bitstamp does not trade BCH. What can I do about trading my BCH for $, I would also trade them straight for BTC. Could you or anyone else chime on this?
I hate being in the middle east because we have slow adoption rates :(
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:01:12
I kept my coins on my trezor. How do I get my cash and gold coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:13:52
PREPARE FOR THE RETRACEMENT. HODL AND EDUCATE 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:43:47
Great will do this tomorrow. I haven't been following much on BCH. Now a good time to sell? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:35:14
Even when my wallet is a hardware wallet like trezor? Or would i send my coins to the core node wallet and then transact? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:42:36
This is horrifying. We must not let this die until its resolved. Or they die. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:22:03
Yeah sorry, not  meaning to attack. But gambling has a negative connotation to it. Why i avoid using it when i explain or talk about bitcoin. Using risk and reward to generate surplus i think is accurate and objective. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:28:32
I moved my coins from a legacy account to a segwit supported account on my Trezor. I do not support segwit2x. Should I move em back into legacy? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:09:39
I am from uae and traded on bitoasis.net. Good stuff  in terms of fees but their max limits are pretty shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:12:29
Get your coins on a hard wallet. Their withdrawal limits are pretty low, so if you are from the region. Get verified with bitstamp. Takes some time but you can trade /buy higher volumes

No idea. All i know is segwit was a soft fork. Not sure what to do... 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:13:34
What about if the coins are in my Trezor. Do i get b2x coins when i plug it back up. Or do i need to move my coins into bitoasis.net so they get duped? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:42:42
My coins are on my Trezor. I did move them to a segwit supported account in Trezor. So not legacy. I am a little confused with what to do with 2x.i dont want it but don't understand what will happen. On the day af the fork my Trezor will show me another set of coins that i can now sell? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:45:27
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:16:16
My coins are in my Trezor. I trade on this exchange. I am not comfortable leaving my coins on nhe exchange but give me some instructions on how to get my b2x to sell.? Please.

Sorry question. I moved my coins from legacy to SW supported accounts. Would you advice I send them back to my legacy accounts? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:02:35
Bt what I want to know is how to keep my current coins safe. I am with core and have no need for 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:44:00
Boom! Thanks!
