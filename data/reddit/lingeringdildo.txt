This is bitfinex's profit (fees earned in the past) in this scenario.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:38:27
Based on 72 million dollars worth of bitcoin missing in just a few hours? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:18:42
Yes, I believe slippage is absorbed by Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:36:05
In a bankruptcy scenario that is true.

2 hrs? Dude, you guys have got to do better than this.

An active loan to a BTCUSD position is someone who has lent money out to another user who purchased BTC with the loaned money.

All positions are settled to USD - so bitfinex would use a portion of their reserves to handle slippage in this scenario. Unless this ends in bankruptcy, users wouldn't be absorbing.

So bitfinex is unwinding operations?

Oh, hey, me too. I also give baseless opinions on the maximum size of blocks in the bitcoin blockchain and post voodoo price charts.

You obviously don't understand how military retirements work in the western world.

Any news on the recovery front?
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:33:01
Because it's been an hour without a new block.

For one, you have to replace the mining chips every few months or your "free" heater becomes economically obsolete.

Bitfinex collects pretty hefty fees (15.0%+), plus your earnings are taxed as income.

I'm just using Google as a replacement. Maybe jail their execs next?
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:25:34
So the rest of us collectively lost 1 BTC? Bad move, F2Pool.
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:59:36
Why the fuck would they be worth more?
