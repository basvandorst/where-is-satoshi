I ran into this recently. Lender wanted a 90 account history to show the funds. I advised the lender that I can sign with the key the funds were in, before the exchange. No dice (Surprise!)
Then they told me that if I gave it to a family member that member could *gift* it to me. 
So basically they told me that the key to bypassing ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING protocols is just to launder it. 
What the actual fuck.

The 12BTC I was speaking of in that thread are (and most likely will forever be) trapped in Gox. At the time I bought those coins they cost 160$ each (Yes, 9 days ago, on Gox, coins were &lt;160$). I happened to have 2000$ in Gox that I figured I'd try and trade with, on the off chance that Gox had a turn around I would have done well, but we all know how that turned out.

The first time it hit a dollar I saw a guy on CaVirtex Exchange put in a sell order at 1000CAD. It seemed crazy at the time. When bitcoin hit 1000CAD for real, that seemed crazy too. Then when it hit 3,000CAD my father-in-law asked if he should buy some, I advised him not to put in more than he could afford to lose. My brother in law told him, “Well really, how much further could it go? I think it’s topped out.” My FIL bought 6k worth of gold instead. ��‍♂️ 
The world has never seen anything like bitcoin before, and as such, people always seem to undervalue it. I don’t pretend to know how high it will go, and anyone who does is either full of shit, or delusional, but I’m in it for the long run.
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:52:34
Telecom infrastructure is almost always backed up with battery strings. Almost everything runs on -48DC in telcos and cellular, this makes the backup really quite simple.

Paper wallets are good, I’ve used them before and stored it in a safety deposit box. I moved to a Trezor after a fire in a business joined to the bank. 
Trezors have recovery methods. I’ve etched my recovery seed onto steel plates and then given them to a few different friends who don’t know eachother but are listed in my will. Just in case. If anything happens to the Trezor, I only have to gather the plates, and I can rebuild my savings. If anything happens to one plate (they’re steel so it’s unlikely) I can gather the other plates and reassemble the recovery seeds.  (Think “RAID” in backup terms)
Paper’s recovery method is to make a duplicate. Then you’ve got two places you can get robbed. :(
There’s probably some recovery method for paper wallets I’ve never heard of, but for me the Trezor is the easiest.

"some glitches" is the kind of terminology that gets places hacked and robbed. There's so many sites that are so eager to get to market that security AND design have taken a back seat.
If there's two reasons people aren't going to get into bitcoin, they're 
A) Being afraid of "small glitches" that will cause they're funds to dissappear.
B) Sites that look like they were designed by a twelve year old for Geo-cities in 1992.

This shouldn't shake your faith/confidence in Bitcoin. Everything "Bitcoin" is still fine and dandy. However, it will shake the exchange rates. If people start having complications getting money into the system, the buyers taper off. If people get spooked by this, it can trigger some pretty big sell-offs.

I used to advocate for e-transfer a lot. Recently though, I learned that if you scream loud enough and include the words "identity theft" they will reverse a transaction, even an inter-bank transaction. Yes, I know they claim to be non-reversible and good as cash, but it's not. I'm not by any means saying you're scamming and it's not my intention to imply that. However a lot of people have the wrong impression about the interac service, and It could end up costing them.

Interac E transfer is ~30min from start to end. There is no "clearing" time because if you don't have the money, you can't send it (rather bitcoin esque). it's password secured, and the only fee is normally 1$ for the transaction for the sender. I use it to sell bitcoins, often.

If you can manipulate it so you're the first one to get one of these monsters, you could definitely turn a profit. Odds are though, you're just going to be part of glut of these things come online all within a week. Driving down the price.
They've scheduled for release in October, making it especially ominous, with the halving coming up right after that point. If you invest in one of these, you better damn sure get it cranking out coins the moment it hits your doorstep and cash the coins as they come. Either that or I'm completely wrong.
TL;DR It's a gamble.

(Full disclosure: I own shares in "HIM") They're a corporation, nationally registered. 815918-1 Canada Inc. Well, at least that's who they claim to be, you could technically go ahead and put whatever to want down off the governments published list of monthly incorporated companies. If you're wondering why they didn't register the company as "Havelock Investments Inc", it's due to a little law about naming corporations. Anything with "Bank", "Investment", "Financial" etc etc needs to be approved by... someone at the bank of Canada(?) I forget the exact details, but ran into a similar situation when trying to register "Flexcoin financial" and ended up with "Flexcoin Inc".
Anyhow, I trust them with my coins, but I bought in at ~7 so I'm in a better position. They have an IPO coming up for units at 15BTC, so I'm surprised that units are selling at 20BTC on their existing fund.

Right, I agree that the costs to move stuff in production is quite high at the moment. But they’re talking about “developing”. And really, if the person has an idea that they want to develop, let them! Encourage them!
No matter which coin you’re bullish on, it will require developers and applications to really push it into main stream, and if we stifle the budding development with the fear that it may not work out in the end, then we may never get to a point where any of this matters. :(

I remember the day a guy paid my friend in Bitcoin for a beer at his bar. 7BTC for that beer, at the time it seemed like a pretty sweet deal for the buyer. 
In the office next door the bar owner had a Gnome Linux desktop machine mining away via CPU. Every hour or so it would just say +50BTC in the console. Nobody much cared. Wasn’t like it was worth anything. 
That bar is long gone now, the owner is long gone too. Monoxide poisoning, in his sleep, accidental, not self inflicted. Whenever I look at the red numbers from buying in December, I think of how lucky I am to still be able to.

Welcome to Bitcoin, where the money is ethereal, and the exchange rate doesn't matter.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:18:57
If you use an ewallet, there's a chance it will get compromised.
If you use an exchange, there's a chance it will get compromised. If you use a premade, pre-printed "bitcoin bill" (Made by a third party) there's a chance it's been compromised.
If you generate your own address with your computer hooked to the web, there's a chance it's been compromised.
For maximum security you have to have your wallet offline and even then, your security is directly proportional to your level of paranoia.
Good luck, and welcome to the wild west.

Practically everyone on this sub-reddit holds Bitcoins. They're invested in the idea that Bitcoin is going up (as it relates to the fiat currency).
What you're asking here is the equivalent of going into an apple store (as in "apple computers") and asking someone who works a the apple store if you should buy an apple device. Their income depends on you buying apple devices!
The best pieces of advice I can give you are:
A) Never invest more than you're willing to lose.
B) Do your research, learn about Bitcoins and what makes them valuable.
C) Never ask the shark if the water is fine, his opinion is skewed.

When I started mining I'd get 50 Bitcoins at a time from my CPU. At that point, 50BTC was dust. I had something like 300 dust at one time then I stopped "dust collecting". Had I kept going, I might not be headed to work right now.
My point is: Just because something is valueless today, does not make it valueless tomorrow.

If you truly are a noob, use the Localbitcoins system for what it was intended for!
Go to your offer, fund the localbitcoins address they specify there (Do NOT fund any address given to you by the buyer.) As you are meeting face to face DO NOT ENABLE ESCROW. The offer will be funded after three confirmations. Setup your meeting place and time.
Meet (At a public place, not in a back alley in East Hastings...), count the cash, and if all is good release the coins usinging one of the methods they list in the offer.
MONEY TALKS. Don't let them convince you that they have the cash, make them show it and hand it to you!

It'd be alot quiter during the boom times.

It seems to thin out the memes while increasing the number of armchair "economists" writing opinion papers about why they aren't selling.

Reminds me of when Blockbuster said that Netflix wasn't worth buying. Businesses can choose not to change, survival is not compulsory.
@_date: 2013-06-24 12:18:48
I've called them before and got a quick answer and response to my issue. Their number isn't hidden.

A simple tag for "New account" would really help weed out sock puppets quickly...
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:13:37
And this is why I shouldn't do things when I first wake up... DERP. I'm going to go have a coffee and sort this out.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:48
Yes, the majority of the posts in this subreddit are now the following:
A) The price. Posted by tons of people every time it goes up, but not down.
B) Opinion papers written by self proclaimed "economists".
C) The exact MtGox queue count.
D) People bitching about coinbase.
E) Meme crap.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:14:19
The "economic action plan" really frees up banks to get nice and reckless with their loans, instead of having to worry about survival. Man, I wish I was a banker.

Having sold, and bought a fair amount I can safely say that Localbitcoins is an excellent resource for local and even online exchange. 
It's a great place to do business, build your reputation, and build your community all at the same time. So get out there, and if you don't trip over your own two feet, there's no telling where you'll end up.

Of course, I was just trying to cut down work on his part :)

Like a promise to ship an ASIC mining rig?

 You can try just blowing away the database directory first and restarting bitcoin. If that doesn't work, then you can spend time redownloading the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:51:08
I feared this would happen when I saw that update icon. Glad I didn't do it!
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:01:57
Did you fall asleep on your "Trezor " key again?
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:15:07
Yes, there are. However, with Google's being open source, I have to ask "Why do you want another 2FA?" There is one called "Authy" that people seem to like to use(?) However, it seems to "phone home" making it not something I'd be willing to use.

I remember doing this with a CPU on the real network and thinking "Well that was easy, now what?". Then I turned off the client. Dumb move.
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:10:19
No need to apologize :)

CaVirtex withdrawals work. They take the advertised amount on the site :)
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:03:54
Oh, I know I've jumped through all the hurdles. :)
@_date: 2013-07-10 05:37:38
Also Santaclaus and Bigfoot are bringing us all slushies, because of very strong hardware sales.
Really though, submitting this kind of crap post which is nothing more than a one lined opinion, is a waste of everyone's time. I award you no up votes, and may God have mercy on your soul.
@_date: 2013-10-01 22:35:42
For the last 4 years! Yeah!
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:49:03
Yeah, that was a disaster that i barely managed to come back from. Thank God (Vishnu, Allah, whatever) for backups.
@_date: 2013-09-23 17:10:18
Imagine this. You gave your kid a bitcoin allowance of $5.00 USD a week starting back in 2009. Now your kid has more in savings than you do. It's a cruel cruel world.

So now we're here:
"Yo dawg!, we heard you like stickers, so we put a sticker over your sticker that we stickered!"
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:09:30
Nope, sure didn't! I rewrote the whole thing minutes before I posted it, to actually take "Seans Outpost" out of the loop :)

If only there was a way to clear history and cache in chrome...
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:21:32
This is the BEST way!

I run Bitcrate.net, and it's not a scam. It's time consuming for me to run, and offers payouts from zero upto 0.001BTC depending on luck. Payouts are cumulative, so not everyone gets paid out every day. Just when an address hits a certain threshold.
As far as my income from it, it's pretty much nil. Just something i do when I have time :)
@_date: 2013-09-25 02:54:59
Yeah, I've had this same argument with myself when bitcoin hit 80cents. Again, after the first bubble when it was ~5$ for the longest time, then at 30$, 60$ and now 120$. No one knows what the future holds, but I personally am sick of having me hand my own ass to myself over not investing 1000$ at an earlier date. I'm in this time.
@_date: 2013-09-09 18:33:11
How do I pre-order these Unicorns? I hear they do 400RHash/sec! ( Rainbow Hashes per Second)
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:55:01
Localbitcoins.com and for all of you who keep saying "email money transfer", those are revirsible, there's a reason liberty-bit dropped folded up shop.
@_date: 2013-08-24 13:29:56
Why not skip this step, and just conclude that Bitcoin was invented by the NSA?
@_date: 2013-09-13 02:27:25
So... a 2 day old user comes to r/bitcoin and asks where he can buy bitcoins in Canada. A provider for bitcoin sales "Couldn't help but notice" the post and name-drops their site...
Oh, and then gets a "vote of confidence" from another user with virtually the same Reddit Birthday.
Seems legit.
*Edit: Also, "localbitcoins.com"

BFL does a fine job of destroying BFL, I don't think they need any help.
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:22:09
Mybitcoin, BitcoinSavingsAndTrust, ButterflyLabs
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:47:41
Pre-order from BFL seems like a pretty common way.
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:27:12
Never heard of them. What do they do?
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:47:50
This is where I do all my Localbitcoins deals!
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:19:25
I got that email too! I love their program!
@_date: 2013-01-19 03:03:41
Yeah, sorry about that. I moved servers, and never put the page back up. I'll throw it back up sometime soon.
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:13:06
I love the claim that Coinapult is the first and only service to allow sending Bitcoin to Email addresses, when Flexcoin was doing that 8 months earlier.
