Maybe their just afraid of the competition.

Bitcoin users not affected.

Speaking skills are not necessarily the same as debate skills. Personality is a strong component. Are you sure Voorhees has the chops to debate a skilled master debater?

This attack would cost a minimum of 383.1326* BTC per day. As soon as someone saw it, miners would give preference to higher transaction fees and alerts would go out.
[0.0005 (transaction fee) + 0.0000543 (minimum transaction)]*8*60*60*24 =383.13216

Thanks for warning me. If I inadvertently bought too much I wouldn't pay my rent and would be homeless. Thank the gods Coinbase lets me set an automatic limit.
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:52:49
Yeah Buddy. I wasn't invited either.

The Bike shop owner was tired of all the fees. They make no mention of the blood sucking leeches the financial institutions have become or the fact that they openly support terrorists and drug lords. Your brother-in-law is a true American hero.

They have online courses in photoshop you might want to try.

Your ~~post-modern deconstructionism~~ **skepticism** is quite cultish.

Sure, demand payment in Bitcoin up front before the goods or services are received, then no debt is incurred. You can demand payment in anything that way.
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:02:27
Because cheese would make sense.

I thought it was the "Something Awful" forum.

Wrong answer, but you may get partial credit if you show your work.

Next to Pumpero and Dumpero.

That should make it much easier for Anonymous to catch them.

I'm more worried about fusion powered mining centralization, tachyon transporter gold thefts, and time traveling double spends.
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:58:53
Oh c'mon! It's better than Buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:29:31
Bitlicense is vaporware. This is good news.
@_date: 2015-02-06 04:46:16


Because everyone else likes their buying power to be stolen.

Fuck politics. Do the science and let the market decide.

Why the secrecy?
