not all, some are stable for whatever reason
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:35:44
But how could you explain it without having it invented first?
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:27:46
because bcashies are salty/bitter af
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:29:43
use at least something like [keepass]( and backup the database to different places
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:55:16
What are you talking about? I started this shitty comment-chain and these people were talking to me you stupid fuck.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:23:00
Sure, as I said, it's all relative. But I bet if 1btc is ~1 million dollars and it is used, people will use satoshis as a description of the unit.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:39:55
Why? Do you think Canada is the only country with a universal healthcare system? Please don't tell me you guys are as self-centered as your american neighbors.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:17:45
I don't pay for it, so yes it's free for me.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:14:07
I know it was a joke and I giggled a little, but actually that is not how universal healthcare works. There are still bills included, especially in the hospital.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:50:20
Could you please stop trolling?
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:59:19
IT can be a scam, what's your point?

this guy was made for memes
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:14:22
You don't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:04:26
why should a sub with the name bitcoin not discuss this fork? especially if bitcoin cash is the one that "follows satoshis vision"? What about the sub btc? will they delete it? you make no sense.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:27:06
this thread is retarded since fag posted it and let me remind you, you brought politics into this. but you are right.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:15:41
or like trump voters are still obsessed with hillary?
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:26:52
Nope you get it when you are about to leave.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:46:24

@_date: 2017-08-29 09:53:35
Oh wow, such good examples, much sense
edit: you will never see a normal person say I had to pay 0.000045 bitcoin for x
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:45:58
oh believe me, I don't want politics here. but the cultish &amp; imo toxic behavior spoke of is onpoint.

I can get money with my credit card worldwide for free.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:21:16
no the question should obv be "what can I buy for one penny"
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:19:32


No I don't think that is useful. It doesn't really matter because it is all relative but I would say the numbers should be around everyday stuff, a million is a lot of money and that should be reflected in the currency number, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:10:29
Why should I? Why didn't they use their critical thinking skills, that I was talking about our healthcare system? So please do me a favor and stfu.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:23:46

yeah and if my grandma would have balls, she would be my grandpa
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:06:01
I never said I know better than them. I know how it works here and that is what I was talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:19:09
do you read the comments you are replying to?
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:15:28
the t_d ranting is onpoint though.
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:44:42
Pff. I don't think you have a fucking clue. Do you think the bills magically disappear because of universal healthcare. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:34:26
There actually is a big difference between "one bit-coin" and "one million dollar". One is one unit and the other is one million units.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:01:07
Why do you think I don't know what I'm talking about? We also have a universal healthcare system, so why don't you go back in the hole you were coming from.
edit: of course a the_dump user. fuck off you idiot
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:33:22
where do you think the stuff you buy comes from?

I'm from germany and as one poster already said you get a bill if you are in the hospital for normal insured people. But there are "private insurances" in germany. It cost a bit more for normal employees but is actually cheaper/~same price for entrepreneurs. They often get a better service, but also have to take/pay the bills and get that money back later when submitting to the insurance company.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:05:44
That's not true anymore for germany. tax will be max. 25% (after 75k€ winnings) imho
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:01:44
huh, I thought it is capital gains and searched for that. good, let's hope it stays that way
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:55:20
that's not a nice way to say "buy the dip"
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:17:19
This would implicate that the investment interest keeps exceeding the debt interest and because no one knows what will happen you have to find a way in the middle, so I would say paying off the minimum sounds like a good idea.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:29:49
Could you show me an article, because the ones I find are all saying that you have to pay 25% + solidaritätszuschlag and kirchensteuer since 2009
for example 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:28:58
haha, the cryptoworld doesn't only consist of the usa, just fyi
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:59:16
at least he should get the taxfree amount this year

unpopular opinion (not coming from me, but I think there is something to it): tech is not for women
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:04:15
So on every dip you are coming out of your hole and telling people they should leave the sinking ship? What is your agenda here? Don't you feel stupid? Should I remind you where the price was when you said it 2-3 years ago and how much money you would have made buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:49:52

The way women think is not good/fitting for technical stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:55:00
Or maybe you are a bot user and want users try to fight your bots and thus losing money, we'll never know ;)
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:45:37
No, I actually said you are not right. I'm relatively open regarding my jobs (developing with/for) and I can guarantee you that not ditching ms wouldn't have giving you a gap in work.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:06:14
I'll take that as a compliment, but I don't think you have to be Bill Gates to know that there is enough work, money to make, in proprietary software, even for each skill-level. everyone who says otherwise simply doesn't have a clue.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:45:11
douchebag much?
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:50:43
You have a error in reasoning here. It's the same with pokerbots. Exchanges, like Pokerrooms, earn with these bots, so they probably don't care, no in reality they like/want them. They get volume and fees.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:59:57
If it is that easy to exploit these bots and earn money, why would you tell us about it?
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:39:57
Sure, there are women good/successful in IT, but they are unicorns. I think it's good to have teams with women, because it balances certain things, but the actual brainpower behind the technical advancements in a project barely come from women.
