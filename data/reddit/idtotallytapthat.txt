What the fuck? It was a hard fork of the bicoin main chain. That's not premining. That was probably the most retarded comment I've ever read. Do you understand what any of the words you used even mean? Are you actually shilling?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:06:48
Yeah it would help if you wouldn't use the word libtard you fucking retard
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:24:54
are you seriously comparing bootleg fireworks to dropping bombs on kids? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:18
Sad how your only defense is to accuse otherse of shilling. This sub should be renamed @_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:13
Where is your consensus?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:58
4mb? Since when? Last I remember segwit gets 1.7 mb on average. 
Also if you weren't talking about lightning network or similar, then why bring up payment channels in the firs place? What other relevance do they have to this discussion
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:27:26
Yes it does, the color of the sky is then named green. In this case, water is green, bluebirds become greenbirds, etc. Its just the name. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:21
Yeah that was the 50 year goal
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:42:08
afraid of getting banned probably
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:22


That is literally false in every way you spin it. I can't believe anyone actually thinks this. Its a Bitcoin fork. It's controlled by nobody. Stop saying things that are false by DEFENITION.


Adaptive blocksize limit and EDA are scaling features too


Who are you to decide this?


Who the FUCK are you to decide this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:08
bitcoin is any peer to peer electronic cash as described by the whitepaper. Bitcoin is the name of the currency being discussed on this sub. bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin is not necessarily the future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:51
The only funny part is that every thing that person said is a true statement. You are displaying cognitive dissonance. It should not be funny to you that a payment method that does not work is discarded for one that does. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:25:27
People on this sub seem to think "faith" is an essential part of Bitcoin. It's why you see so much hodl bullshit being spread around. People don't understand the difference between Bitcoin and bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:45:58
Buddy now it looks like you're trying to tell me that being convicted of any crime makes you incapable of being emotional over the deaths of innocents. I guess my weed smoking ass is incapable of love after all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:08:01
Except none of the evidence reflects his argument
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:24
 &gt;Could you please tell me how I specifically "misrepresent" HFTs? Please provide an exact quote (don't sloppily paraphrase me). Thanks in advance.
When you provide the bit of evidence about payment channels you are considering lightning network, correct? Lighting network is for transactions that are small value day to day purchases, in the sub $1000 range. That is for certain not Satoshi's idea of a high frequency transaction.


Not a straw man my friend. There is no reason why the block size can't be raised in conjunction with lighting networks development. Segwit is a compromise. At the end of the day, 4mb blocks would do practically no damage to decentralization, and would support the network until lighting network arrives. 1mb is archaic be ANY standards. I think that is intentionally crippling the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:09
Sorry but none of the sources you cite back your argument. In fact you are specifically bending what he is saying to back your argument.
In particular, Satoshi says clearly that "disk space should not be a problem" in his white paper in the section where he discusses the yearly growth rate (the section you claimed as evidence.)
You also claim that Satoshi talked about payment channel implementation for high frequency trading. This is correct, however you misrepresent what a high frequency transaction is. High frequency transactions are transactions like in IOTA where you pay incredibly small amounts for incredibly small services. Satoshi does not AT ALL think that the average Joe buying coffee should go off chain. 
When he rejected attempts to hard fork up from 1mb, it was because 1mb blocks we're not even being filled at the time.
Your only good evidence is in his post about bitDNS where Satoshi aknowledges the fact that Bitcoin users cannot arbitrarily increase the block size without  risking centralization. 
Satoshi was never in favor of intentionally crippling the network in order to preserve a vague sense of decentralization. At the end of the day, we know that 2mb is possible, 4mb is possible, and even 8mb is possible without compromising decentralization. Raspberry pis can run full nodes on 8mb block currencies that shall remain unnamed because of the sub were in. 
At the end of the day Bitcoin was intentionally crippled in order to develop lighting network.

spreading FED I see
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:39:52
Its not a secret lmao. It's literally their thesis. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:41:09
If you're paying fees then it's not spam. It's a real transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:26:16
There are no such things spam transactions. Please educate yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:37:18
actually no, the graphs in the images are linear logs, where as this graph is just linear. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:44:09
But you payed fees on that "spam" and if you did it at any significant rate, you would bankrupt yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:17:10
As opposed to roller coaster memes?
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:59:01
But why do you think it is not a good time to increase block size now?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:45:54
You've been decieved.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:38:57
I disagree, believes strongly in anti-censorship. They literally will let trolls run their course because they are so anti-censorship. Even if it is an echo chamber, its at least a fair echo chamber.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:43:21
Ok firstly, Bitcoin only keeps transactions with the highest fees. If the mempool gets filled, then low fee transactions are discarded. Secondly, any transaction that is confirmed is a real transaction. If you are paying fees, then you are doing a real transaction. Just because it's a small transaction doesn't make it spam. Educate yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:30:34
If you post rapidly then you will have a grace period where you cannot post. Not a ban. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:40:05
Average fee $10, average conf in the multiple hour range, Indeed segwit is the best
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:43:24
oh man 51 upvotes in an hour dude solid proof right there total shill. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:36:23
Is this a fucking joke? Crypto needs "loyalty" now? Fuck out of here. Crypto is driven by one thing and one thing alone and thats viability. I don't stay loyal to a fucking development group, that's retarded. FFS learn to think for yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:46:30
This is true. This argument pretty much segues into the argument that the only real value Bitcoin has is in its viability as a currency. And that really is all that it has ever had going for it, the fact that it is a revolution of economy. That is why It took off in the first place. The argument is that bitcoin will succeed only if people are actually ready to start using bitcoin for day to day purchases. 
Fees are at an average of $10. That is not sustainable. Core's solution to this has been SegWit and Lightning, and I honestly don't understand, because neither of these things are necessary when you can safely increase the block size to pretty much any necessary level, as of now at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:33:17
You sound like a shill
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:58:30
I seriously doubt you're censored on because they literally let trolls run rampant because they hate censorship so much

btc is going to die unless core scales up. Which it seems to be vehemently against.
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:46:22




even in ancient greece you would be laughed at for what you have just said
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:50:10
do you seriously believe a sudden 500% increase in volume is average people deciding to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:03:11
I suggest you pull out at least half, because 2x fork is coming and you never know what might happen. If 2x becomes longest pof then you may just lose all your money
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:58:48
jesus you're delusional. Bitcoin is a fucking currency. You want to store value? Get some actual fucking assets. I don't know if you're a shill or a troll  or whatever but I seriously feel bad for you if you're convinced that bitcoin is going to hold up with a failing architecture.
