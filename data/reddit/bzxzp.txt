Doesn't really make sense to me. If Bitcoin increases in value and becomes more mainstream, the dollar will decrease in value until it is no longer used and is worth 0. So people who get into Bitcoin early will gain wealth, but they are taking it from people who got into Bitcoin late and kept fiat. There is no wealth magically created, it just gets shifted around, it's a zero sum game essentially.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:39:15
If most people refuse to sell, it is easier for Bitcoin to go down. The less Bitcoin there are being traded, the more volatile it can be, holders make the problem worse.

That's why you don't hold dollars for long periods of time... The dollar is inflationary because the government doesn't want you hoarding US dollars. The benefit of the US dollar is that it is stable enough so your dollar doesn't change in value at a very noticable rate, so if you have a bunch of money saved up for a down payment on a house or something, that down payment doesn't suddenly drop in value.

Yes Visa and MasterCard use more energy than Bitcoin. They also process thousands more transactions than Bitcoin. On a per transaction basis they are orders of magnitude more efficient. I read a very pro-bitcoin article ( that estimated bitcoins energy usage as 1/3 as much as the global banking system, which is an insanely high number given how little Bitcoin is used compared to other currencies.

They came from increased inflation of worldwide currencies due to adoption of Bitcoin. Whenever you buy Bitcoin with USD, you devalue the USD a little bit. So the houses come from everyone who is not buying Bitcoin. And also from the bag holders who bought Bitcoin at 19k and held on to it as it crashed.

How is buy and hold anti-innovation? How is day trading any more innovative? And you can buy and hold while taking risky positions, pretty sure Buffett does it all the time. The best strategy with Bitcoin, at least historically, has been to buy and hold anyways.

Do you have numbers to back up what you are saying? Because to me it seems like people are making more now than they have historically, after adjusting for inflation.

Before there were more transactions than could fit in blocks, so there was an increasing backlog that caused everyone to complete for limited space and increased fees. Now there are less transactions coming in that can fit into blocks, so there isn't that competition.

If this is real, I really think you should reconsider. If selling 10% is enough to pay off significant debts, you have a lot invested in it, and you are investing a significant amount of your net worth in a single, extremely risky asset.

You completely missed my point. If Bitcoin was to replace legacy banking, it would have to replace several systems, including Visa. Replacing Visa alone at current efficiency levels would require half the world's energy. Therefore replacing all of legacy banking with Bitcoin would require more than half the world's energy. Legacy banking obviously uses less than half the world's energy, so it is more efficient than bitcoin.

Have you actually looked at the numbers? Because I absolutely agree that Bitcoin's energy usage is comparable to other stores of value - thats the problem. Bitcoin handles many orders of magnitude fewer transactions than other currencies, so per-transaction it is incredibly inefficient (as it has to be, due to it being decentralised, proof of work, etc.)

What is there that is more stable than the dollar? Over the course of the year, a dollar looses around 2 percent of its value, and does not fluctuate throughout the year - that sounds pretty stable to me. The inflation of the dollar is intentional and predictable, the point of the dollar is that, if you are getting paid some amount per month, you don't have to worry about being able to afford rent or something because the currency just changed its value. I cant think of too much else that provides that guarantee. Maybe government bonds or something, I don't know.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:57:48
At current energy usage, if Bitcoin scaled to the same level as visa, it would take something like half of the world's energy, so it clearly uses way more energy than the entire banking system. But your right, the energy usage could decrease in the future, but we don't know how much - it has to go down by a lot to be even close to the energy usage of conventional banking.
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:10:49
My bank has no fees fees for withdrawal, has very small fees for debit transactions (and the fees are hidden from me), lets me do free e-transfers in seconds, and has no monthly fees as long as my balance isn't tiny. That image is not an accurate representation of the modern banking system. If you are going to argue for Bitcoin, arguing that it is cheaper isn't going to work, because banks will always undercut it, and banking can be essentially free if you get the right accounts (or net positive) anyways.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:11:31
How would Bitcoin fix the issue of less regulations around banks? If anything it would make it worse, since it is harder to regulate. Bitcoin can't replace banks anyways, it can replace the dollar, if Bitcoin becomes popular people will still put their money in a bank, it will just be one that uses Bitcoin.
Seems pretty odd for supporters of Bitcoin, a currency that is supposed to have no regulation, to use reduced regulations on banks as a reason why banks are bad.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:52:51
It's actually not that hard to prove Bitcoin, in its current state, is very innefficient. Take the energy usage of Bitcoin (~35 twh annually), divide by the transactions per second (~8), multiply by the transactions per second of the world (probably over 10,000). That tells you that, at bitcoins current energy usage, it would take 40,000 twh annually to power - pretty close to the amount of energy the world uses in a year afaik, or at least a significant portion of it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:02:41
I'm not saying that it makes sense, but it seems like everyone stores their Bitcoin on exchanges, and I doubt that would change if more casual users start to use Bitcoin. People don't want to be their own bank, they want someone else to take on the risk of their Bitcoin being lost. Also you need banks for loans and investments and other things which won't go away with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-05-27 16:38:45
Bitcoin uses far more energy than banks to process a single transaction, even with all the bank buildings and employees. And the majority of banking isn't transaction processing anyways, that can be all automated. So Bitcoin replaces a subset of the banking system at a much higher energy cost than the entire banking system.

We should be getting richer through investments, not through speculation on a commodity.

@_date: 2018-05-28 15:13:25
I don't really get your point. If banks only use 100Twh per year, they are clearly using far less energy than Bitcoin for the same functionality - Bitcoin processes a tiny fraction of the transactions that they do, and does not provide financial advice, loans, fraud protection, etc., while still using 50Twh.
If you think that banks shouldn't be allowed to be bailed out and screw over the taxpayer, that's fine, but I don't see how it is related to energy usage

But the value of the dollar remained consistent throughout all of that, inflation is still present, but low. The effect on the average person is minimal - they don't have to worry about the dollar changing value as long as they don't use it to save money over the long term (which is what inflation is trying to discourage, once a currency is an investment it becomes volatile). Can you give examples of things that are more consistent on a monthly basis than the dollar, because I can't think of many.

You see posts fairly frequently of someone who lost Bitcoin because of some scam or mistake, that doesn't happen with banks if you are in a stable country.

Your right, Bitcoin itself shouldn't need regulation, just like the dollar itself shouldn't need regulation. But the industries surrounding Bitcoin definitely need to be regulated, just like banks need to be regulated. Just look at MtGox - no regulation was great until it shut down, and then all of the sudden people realized why we have things like bank bailouts. Everyone in MtGox got bailed out, just by the legal system instead of the government.

We don't really know how energy usage will change when scaling up, if Bitcoin becomes more popular, I would expect the amount of Bitcoin miners to scale along with the increased popularity, causing a linear increase with respect to transaction volume. The easiest ways to compare right now is on a per transaction level, since we don't know how it will scale.

Bitcoin is accepted barly anywhere when compared to every other currency which, in their market, is accepted essentially everywhere. What percentage of merchants accept Bitcoin do you think? Maybe 1%, 2% if you are lucky? It's so few that posts showing a store accepting Bitcoin still get lots of upvotes here. Maybe you have a different threshold than me for "barely anywhere" though.

I mean I'm no expert, but a lot of federal debt is to other parts of the government, so it kind of cancels out. Also a lot is debt to Americans, when Americans buy bonds, that is a loan to the government (it's why they are so stable, if the government can't pay back that loan we have bigger problems). And of course the US is in debt to other countries as well. So they borrow from a lot of places.

The euro is widely accepted inside of its market. Just like essentially every other common currency. It isn't accepted outside of its market, but that is a choice not a limitation. Bitcoin is barely accepted anywhere. Go to a grocery store and ask to pay in Bitcoin, odds are they will say no.
The volatility of other currencies is not even comparable to Bitcoin, sure maybe the euro went down 20% that one time, but Bitcoin does that on a regular basis, over single days.
For fraud, you are right, the fraud is not the fault of Bitcoin, but banks provide fraud protection that prevents you from being scammed by third parties, and can reverse fraudulent transactions. Bitcoin does not allow you to do this, so for the average consumer they are far more likely to lose money due to fraud while using Bitcoin.

Spending doesn't require buying commodities, it can also be through investment. If you aren't spending money on either goods or investments, the money itself becomes and investment, which can be dangerous because, I would imagine, it introduces volatility.

It verified more strongly for centralized systems than decentralized systems. Visa has been processing transactions for years with very little downtime.

Seems like a bit of a strawman. I don't think anyone is arguing that Bitcoin is currently using more energy than the banking system as a whole. What they are saying is that, per transaction, Bitcoin is using far more energy than traditional banking (which is pretty clearly true, Bitcoin is orders of magnitude less efficient), and so if it scales up it could have an extremely high energy usage. Of course when you scale up the energy usage may not necessarily scale linearly, but we don't really know how Bitcoin will scale because right now it can't (we will see what happens once lightning becomes more popular). I would expect that the energy usage would scale somewhat linearly with respect to price, since if the value of Bitcoin doubles, the mining reward doubles, so the system can support twice the number of miners and still have them make the same profit as before.
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:23:34
How does Bitcoin become more efficient as it is used more? The more it is used, the higher the price gets, so the greater the mining reward, leading to greater energy usage. And yes, LN could solve the energy problems, but we don't know yet because it isn't actually used.
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:15:35

A significant vulnerability in Linux would be far more damaging than one in Bitcoin. Everyone uses Linux nowadays, it is what is running the worlds financial software, and there is far more incentive to ensure it has no vulnerabilities. Every major tech company relies on it, and spends lots of money on ensuring it is secure, Bitcoin does not have nearly the same amount of support. Also Bitcoin relies on Linux, since it is probably a fair assumption to say that most Bitcoin nodes and miners are running Linux. Therefore a vulnerability in Linux could also take down Bitcoin.

One bug can certainly infect the entire network if it is in the newest version of the Bitcoin software, and isn't discovered until most people have updated.

@_date: 2018-06-01 21:10:57
How do you know visa has a single point of failure in their system? I would imagine they have redundancy for pretty much anything. Even decentralized systems can go down, often with some unexpected behavior from a single component. If you are referring to Visa as an entity being a single point of failure, I don't think that makes much sense, since there are other repayment processors you can use.
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:27:07
They are completely related, since if the price of BTC increases, it will become more profitable for miners, so more of them will start mining, increasing the energy usage until it stops being profitable again.

1 million TPS is pretty easy to achieve with a small network - a regular database should be able to handle that fine if there is decent caching in front of it. The difficulty comes from making a large decentralised network that can handle that kind of load.

Wow, I'm surprised how low that uptime is actually. 4 nines isn't great, you should be trying for 5 nines if you are doing finance. So yea that link does not prove your point, it does the opposite.
And I would consider the network as stopped when transactions cost like $20 to go through. Regardless, that's not my point. All I am saying is that decentralisation does not mean the network is impossible to take down. It is certainly harder for it to go down, but if there is some bug released that causes an issue after a certain period of time, for example, that could take down the entire network, among lots of other potential issues that could be introduced.

Decentralised systems can still fail, decentralisation means it is harder to fail, not impossible. Since Visa has not failed in years, I find it hard to believe that they have many single points of failure. Being hacked has nothing to do with single points of failure either.
Fiat in general seems pretty decentralised to me. Lots of payment processors exist, and you can always use cash if you have to or write a cheque. I can't think of a time where it was impossible to pay for things with fiat - the same has not been true of Bitcoin, when transaction fees were prohibitively high at some points.

Banks do much more than just move money around, Bitcoin can't replace things like investment advice, loans, mortgages, etc.
And regardless, Bitcoin, per transaction, uses more energy than the entire global financial system. It uses ~25twh of electricity annually to support less than 5 transactions per second. Visa handles a couple thousand transactions per second, so let's say that, globally, we have 5,000 transactions per second. This is 1000 times the amount Bitcoin handles, so, at Bitcoins current per transaction energy usage it would take 25×1000=25,000twh of electricity annually to power. This is close to the electricity consumption of the entire world. So if the financial system was as innefficient as Bitcoin, it would take up most of the world's electricity.

I think treating Bitcoin as a stock is a very bad idea. If Bitcoin is supposed to be a store of value or a currency, the last thing you want is for it to increase in value significantly year over year. Stocks and Bitcoin are fundamentally different things, stocks provide increasing value as the company increases in size, and Bitcoin only provides increasing value as the number of people using it increases. If Bitcoin reaches full adoption, it shouldn't be increasing in value anymore, with the exception of minor deflation which is a bad thing anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:34:02
My point is you can't predict how good your current hand is based on your previous hands, you gotta just take a look at your cards. Similarly, with Bitcoin, you can't predict if your investment will pay off based on whether or not it did in the past, you have to look a the market and determine what you think the value of Bitcoin should be based on its current popularity and viability. You can learn from your previous mistakes, you can't learn from your previous cards.

Yea I mean civilian casualties are inevitable, so as long as we are taking measures to avoid them I don't have a problem with it. Someone had to fight the wars no one else wants to.

Even in the US they are, the US is a pretty great place to live compared to most countries in the world
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:48:38
Probably, considering how the US GDP is increasing. As long as your investments pay off more than your debts cost you, there isn't a problem. The US is too big to fail anyways, worst case they default on a few bonds or something but I don't see that happening considering how well the economy is doing.

Removing capital gains tax would massively contribute to the increasing wealth gap in the US, which most people already think is a problem.

Why is Linux so much more secure than Windows for the average person?

Probably better to put that money into some sort of retirement fund or something instead, unless you are OK with a decent risk of losing it all.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:55:53
Most servers in the world run Linux, so I would imagine that there would be a significantly higher incentive to find exploits for Linux than for Windows.

There's nothing wrong with saving money, but you shouldn't be saving it in the form of a currency, you should be saving it in the form of an investment so that other people can use it instead of it just sitting in a bank and doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:30:02
If you are a saver and are keeping your money in the form of a currency instead of some sort of investment, you aren't a very good saver. Currencies are for transactions, not saving up money.

The headline seems to be equating global wealth with personal wealth. If that is the case, it seems pretty sustainable - an individual making $100,000 a year would be doing pretty well if they only had $100,000 in debt.

That's sunk cost fallacy. It doesn't matter how much you invested initially. If you think it will recover, hold, otherwise sell.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:55:41
But being able to do that is a bad thing, since it makes it much easier to do things like insider trading which are illegal for a reason

These "company tokens" are the exact same as stocks but without as much regulation around trading. Probably not a good thing, we have regulations for a reason.

I think it is more likely that houses would only be owned by rich people, and everyone else would rent from them. House prices aren't just high because they can be bought with credit, there are fundamental costs associated with building a house, the cost of materials and labour won't go away if demand for houses decreases.

Obviously it is possible to have all of those things privatised, but I believe that, even if you don't have any money, you should still have someone there to enforce laws on your behalf, and give you healthcare.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:09:31
Why would you hold on to a currency? The point of a currency is to use it for transactions, not to hold it, that's the reason they are inflationary - to discourage you from holding it, since if you treat it like an investment it becomes volatile and discourages investment.
Setting up savings accounts is so easy you really have no excuse for loosing money to inflation anyways. Just throw your money in a savings account, or open up a retirement fund or something, even if there was no inflation at all it would still be the best option.

So your logic is that, because taxation can contribute to wars, it is bad? First, you clearly do not need taxation to have a war (Rwanda had a genocide that taxation didn't contribute to at all afaik).
Second, just because some taxation is used for bad things, doesn't mean it is bad in general. Similarly, I could say that Bitcoin means allowing people to hire hitmen anonymously, and buy drugs like Fentanyl online, that doesn't mean Bitcoin is bad, it just is used in bad ways sometimes.

Where is the issue here? They found the mistake and solved it right away.

Not necessarily, there are costs associated with building a house that do not change when demand changes, if it costs 300k in materials and labour to build a house, no one will build and sell the house for 280k. I would imagine we would just have less houses, and the price of those houses would not change too much.

So isn't the USD a larger economy than Bitcoin? And the euro, and pretty much every other major currency?
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:38:59
How do low interest rates devastate middle-class workers? Most families in the US own a house, probably with a mortgage. If interest rates were higher, that mortgage would cost thousands more per year. Not sure what interest rates have to do with Bitcoin anyways, even if the currency people use changes, they way they lend money doesn't necessarily have to.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:49:35
You didn't actually address the points I made. Of course I would rather not pay for wars I don't believe in, but I think the benefits of taxation are worth it. Just like you probably don't want to contribute to all the bad things Bitcoin is used for, but do anyways by supporting it because you think the benefits of Bitcoin outweight the costs.
Edit: Also, I live in Canada. I support most military operations carried out by the Canadian government, if anything I think the military should get more funding.

Two reasons
1. I think that cryptocurrencies are in a bubble (clearly they were before the crash, I think they still are), so it is nice to debate people with the opposite opinion and feel superior
2. I dislike cryptocurrencies because I don't think they provide much value, and have huge negative externalities. The environmental damage by cryptocurrencies is huge, and I think is especially damaging when we should be doing all we can to reduce energy usage. Also I need cheap graphics cards, and it seems wasteful for all these electronics just doing proof of work and not producing anything useful.

Why does it make them a scummy company to raise their rates? You aren't entitled to get services from them at a certain price, if you don't like it just use Transferwise, which is way better anyways.

Isn't anarchy the purest form of capitalism - a completely free market, where everyone owns what they produce? I mean it is possible an anarchist society could organise into some form of socialism, but that requires groups of people to have some sort of leadership that is trusted enough to not seize control and take all of the wealth, which seems pretty unlikely to me.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:48:44
Yes, taxation is worth that, since the alternative is having complete anarchy. The US is a pretty amazing place to live, and the reason it can get that way is because there is a stable government funded by taxes. If you think that no government is better than the US government, you are either ignorant or stupid.

Wow, this is the first time I have seen someone say "Taxation is theft" unironically. Clearly the world is better with taxes, and just because it is difficult to link every Bitcoin address to a person, does not mean it is impossible, or that the government will not find out about your Bitcoin (especially if you make a lot of money with Bitcoin and start spending above your means).

The part of banking that LN replaces (the payments) does not close "at 3PM on a Friday". The part of banking Bitcoin can never replace (investments, currency conversion, depositing physical money) are the parts that have operating hours.

That doesn't really make sense to me. Inflation would be constantly reducing the amount of that bad debt, and low interest rates would mean that their debt grows more slowly.

Thats fine, and it happens all the time through my taxes, and charity donations. I believe that, since we have a very wealthy society, it makes sense to support those who can't support themselves. How much money you have is largely random anyways, if you happen to be born with a mental disability in a poor area or something, you are screwed through no fault of your own.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:39:12
But anyone in the middle class who isn't an idiot will put their spare cash in a retirement fund or something that will grow at a rate higher than inflation, so inflation doesn't hurt them.
