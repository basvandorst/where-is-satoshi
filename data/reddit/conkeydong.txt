Its socialism for the 1%.

It didn't die stateside either.  It just transformed into House.

Couldn't happier with my Nexus 5. Amazing phone.

Or the logo used on every hipstery coffee shop in the past 5 years?

Thought you lived in Pennsylvania along the Delaware River until I saw your tags.

Does this in any way threaten BTC-e? I have a fair amount of currency sitting in their exchange.

Wish I could say the same thing...but 5 months ago or so I thought it would be a good idea to convert half my BTC into DOGE.  Just kill me now.

Why not 'Leahs'? Lets ensure that Leah Goodman's shame never ends, rather than keep mentioning the name of the guy that just wants to be alone.

Ok cool, thanks.

I need to learn to not blow my wad all at once.  Even if it seems like its cheap, I should leave some in reserve in case it gets cheaper.

For me its the tethering.  On an iPhone with AT&amp;T, I'd have to pay an additional $20/month for them to enable a disabled feature that my phone has the capability to do out of the box.  With an Nexus 5, tethering just works.

I just scooped up a couple coins at $670 each.  I've watched these cycles of panic selling followed by steady gains occur so often now that I no longer get panicked about them and only see them as opportunities.

That's okay...I like the name even better now!

The US Dollar has been around for 221 years and is the world's reserve currency. Giving Bitcoin only 5 years to overtake it doesn't seem quite fair.

It definitely is just the provider, not Apple's doing.  But I'm pretty sure that all the stateside providers that sell subsidized iPhones on 2 year contracts disable tethering unless you add it to your plan.  And I'm definitely not buying an unsubsidized $700 iPhone when I can get a Nexus straight from Google for $350!

They're just decimal places.  If the public can't wrap their head around paying 0.003 BTC for something then we can easily switch to mBTC or even uBTC.  But frankly I don't think you're giving people enough credit. They'll adjust even if we stick with BTC units and a BTC winds up being worth thousands.

What's significant about Cyprus? Is that the first national economy Bitcoin is poised to overtake?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:03:50
My only regret is that I don't have more expendable cash to pick up coins for cheap right now.

Its on another level from the other two.  Breaking Bad is amazing and Walking Dead is pretty entertaining, but the Wire is trancendent. It starts off like a simple cops vs. drug dealers show but becomes an epic, heartwrenching journey through the heart of the disfunction of US cities. Should be required viewing for every American.

I was just wondering the same thing.  Thinking I might put $100 into each of the current top 10 on the list.  $1,000 is not that big of a deal to lose, but if even one of those crypto currencies pans out the way Bitcoin did...
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:56:54
That's amazing. I have the exact same combination on my luggage.

Your place is like mine: small, modern, and with a massive fuck-off TV.

I've made 5 trades through Coinbase and each one went through just fine.
