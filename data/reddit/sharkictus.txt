Nor should you. Other currencies existing is very important for bitcoin, and while we live in a culture that requires us to buy products (cars and houses) we can only afford through loans, we need inflationary to exist side by side.

IMO the only reason to have debt after a certain age is loans to start a business. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:36:44
Only if you have loans in bitcoin..which honestly, I will probably leave the market if loans are done the same way we do loans with inflationary market...

Insurance, maintenance, and fuel is more expensive for those cars, and they are just status symbols.

That gives too much credit to people, I still suspect most of them are doing it for free.

This tells me there's need to be more exchanges(and companies liek Coinbase as well) all accross the board.
We're aiming for decentralization, one exchange shouldn't have this large of a ripple effect, even with our low market cap.

I did buy like .12 at 800s. Regret it, but I figured my low priced purchases made up for it. 
Majority of of my 1.2 bitcoin was bought at 555. 
I'd buy more if I had the cash, because my plan is to sell anything more than 1 btc to make up for my principal investment, but only once its high enough. 
If I was working though I'd spend like 200 every month on btc, but no job means I have to be more careful...

@_date: 2014-02-09 05:51:59
I just want it to  be low enough for me to afford a nice big buy, so I can own one whole BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:53:06
They would be required to pay what they owe in inflationary fiat. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:23:18
It might be higher, since more will be willing and able to pay. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 04:25:50
Can the network handle that kind of usage?

Thank God for this, I haven't been paying as much attention as I should, because of Twitch Plays Pokemon..
@_date: 2014-04-03 07:43:30
I dislike the loan system, bit I see its use. I do not see compatible with a deflationary currency. A decentralized inflationary currency could work though for that purpose. 
I still hold it is better to have multiple competing currencies of varying types.

As a small player, I'd only that with half my bitcoins once I have a decent supply.

Are we in despair or did we pass it?
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:43:03
Does this mean the price will drop?
I will able to afford to buy more!

Can't wait for crash, hope it won't have long term implications for post crash growth.

Man as  a nooby I've been waiting for this, I just gotta get my bank account verified before it rises again..
Next bubble, I'll see a fourth of my bitcoins of what I think is the peak, equal amount if it goes higher again, and one last sell if it keeps rising, leaving me with 1/4 of my original bitcoins. Then I'll wait for the next correction, and buy new bitcoins with most my profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:13:35
I may want it to drop a bit more..and then rise. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:36:13
I don't see any real chance of it being higher than 50k. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:41:48
Wouldnt a trillion market cap make 1 btc $47,000? Not a 100 k.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:44:07
I won't wait six months, but I won't buy right now, I want see if this spike is temporary and maybe a a short term bubble. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:24:07
If it doesn't work out, I can skim off the top during high bubbles and be good now. If it does, I will rather well to do in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:25:17
I've been having trouble verifying my bank...
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:46:36

@_date: 2013-11-26 02:36:31
I can smile too!
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:06:49
Am I the only one excited for the lower price? You can buy more now!
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:54:45
Bitcoin is decentralized, one world gov is rather centralized...
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:55:46
Hand tracing linear if it grew normally would make it 700s, and log is 500s.
Though I'd still be excited if drop under 20...
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:24:08
Hold multiple types of currency as well. Euros, pounds, USD, plus some of the the cryptocurrencies, bit and lite, and maybe some precious metals. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:41:34
I'm excited because of the price drop...I can buy more...
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:25:56
Thank you good man. You are rewarded..with a bigger smiler. :-D
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:24:46
Actually I think by next October, normal line price will probably be above 500. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:35:38
My dad us overly cautious and/or really cheap...back in the 90s when gold was low he refused to buy until it got lower. We are the only family in our family who to this day doesn't own gold. 
I did explain to him what bitcoin, especially during the last peak, he's OK with me putting some of my money in. He actually said he'll give me $100 for Christmas to additionally invest in. 
But he personally won't invest...partially cause money is tight, partially because it's too risky, partially because he has hard time wrapping his mind decentralized currency, and partially because he suspects its a scam.

Unfornately my bank is stupid, it won't let me do online banking for some reason, haven't had time to call and inquire..
So I'm doing the deposit thing verification thing, at least when I call to find out that amount, I can deal with the online issue as well..
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:29:46
Yeah I wouldn't see him supporting it fully. I love the man and all, but he also has trouble trying to figure out the network neutrality out and the role of ISP's in terms of private property, and regulation. 
That's bit of beast for an older man already, bitcoin would be way too much. 
The man prefer physical metal standards, and believes in intrinsic value, he would like bitcoin over fiat currency, but not that much. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:30:01
Well it has it, it just won't let me access it...
