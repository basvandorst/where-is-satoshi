So just hodl and don’t worry about price if it’s a real long term investment? I believe in BTC and what it’s doing for those who don’t have access to banking and or are getting treated unfairly around the world by banks and what not but sometimes I just don’t know
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:49:32
That actually makes more sense thank you for that
@_date: 2018-09-25 08:25:20

Thank you for your response ��
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:24:00
Yes if you have a consumer mindset. The rich have an investor mindset and they don’t spend unless it’s towards investments that will bring a turn. That’s how the rich get richer. Don’t be a consumer (not you in general, just all my BTC friends here). We’re a family! 
@_date: 2018-09-01 05:04:40

@_date: 2018-09-06 00:48:56
Do you think price will continue to drop? Your own opinion, saw APomo thinks it’s more likely to hit $3k than $10k, I’m not worried much about price but more for when I should put into my favorite project, Vechain

@_date: 2018-09-06 00:42:15
Oh no I am but I’m curious if why things happen and if it’s somewhat smart to take small % of BTC, convert to fiat and then when BTC keeps dropping return that fiat for BTC to accumulate more?

You’re spot on Clifton. I’ve spent $1ks on mentors like Grant and have learned a great deal from them which has been life changing. I’ve seen most of his videos and he’s usually positive or neutral about BTC since it’s not his field of expertise like real estate &amp; sales. Thanks for the comment! I love engagement. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:14:26

Yeah mentors have really changed my life which is why now I’m mentoring those who are interested in making money using the internet (not with BTC (even though I tell everyone about it) but with whatever strengths people have). If I can recommend someone: Peter Drucker. He has a book &amp; audible “Managing Oneself” &amp; “Effective Executive” which are great. If you’d like any other info just message! ���� 
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:31:13

He should have understood what he was getting into rather than trying to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 15:32:33
Lol I’m 2020 he’s going to be miserable ��‍♂️ but that’s life sometimes. Hopefully he bounces back.

Wonderful. Don’t stop learning or having mentors just because you’re “self-taught”. You didn’t teach yourself, you learned from others online or through some platform with someone else’s help. No one is “self taught”. That’s your ego speaking. Read a book from Will Durant, lol you’re not any more special than the next “self taught”. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:06:43
No bounce orders �� next time!
