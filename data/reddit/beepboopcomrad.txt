Bitcoin to me is the currency of the future. A borderless currency controlled by the people for a private exchange of goods and services. People in a hundred years will wish they could go back in time and be part of what is happening now. Only a handful of people are really trusting what this is and will be. Currently we are dependent on fiat. That is why I’m steadily building up bitcoin for my future and because it’s an exciting experiment we are taking part in. I can only truly hope my investments improve my future life, but I’m confident my actions now will improve the next generations of my family.

That will change when you can buy anything at anytime with crypto just like fiat. Right now, I can’t go to my local supermarket and buy my groceries with crypto.

But why tho

I feel that this sub is more about the revolutionary aspects of bitcoin against the old way of fiat money, but many come here to discuss turning fiat into bitcoin, then back into fiat.

The fed prints money non stop. 
Jagex discontinued holiday items.  
Of course a in game item that is limited in supply would create demand as scarcity increased in time. I can see the relation to bitcoin. There will be a finite amount of whole BTC available, which if the concept survives (I think it will) a whole BTC will be astronomical just like a RuneScape holiday rare. 
My personal belief is that anyone holding a whole or near a whole BTC will have created a great fortune for their grandchildren if the concept becomes as mainstream as the internet once all coins have been mined and are out there. 
This isn’t even considering the thousands of coins lost or just forgotten.  In RuneScape, I’m sure there are hundred or even thousands of accounts that are just sitting with multiple Party Hats. Taking something out of circulation, decreases the supply. 
No doubt in my mind that BTC now is in its infancy. Let’s say BTC can buy you $10k worth of stuff now. I’d imagine when all the coins are mined, a BTC will have the purchasing power of $100m or more. Yet there is a finite supply of gold on Earth. Think about the prices of gold. How much is lost and how much is yet to be discovered. If the news broke today that all the Earth’s gold has been mined, what would happen to the price?

BTC won’t break 11k. Hope I’m wrong.

Now flip it for when the price starts crashing.

You lost me at ...Russia and China are taking over war power... Global economics aside, there is nothing on this planet more powerful than the United States Military. And that’s not some BS patriotic parroting. The scale of our military is vast and our ability of logistics is unmatched. Just look our military spending and budget compared to other nations including China and Russian GDP. I know a lot of people hate America, think it’s garbage and want it to fail, but if you deny America as a military superpower, then you are kidding yourself.

Or just use coinbase! /s

Im confident that once you can use bitcoin in 100% of your daily transactions, the purchasing powers of a single bitcoin would be light years beyond what it is today. I’m assuming  that may take several decades and many hurdles. Your great grandchildren may greatly benefit from a relatively small investment today. The scarcity of bitcoin is unbelievable and it’s only going to get more scarce as time moves forward.

And your country is a dog turd compared to the United States. No offense, but let’s be real. America is stronger, richer and more powerful than every nation out there. Sure they grow stronger, but we currently run the show. Sorry if that hurts your feelings.

Well instead of a debit card, you just scan your phone at the store. Your phone will become your encrypted “debit card”.

Hence why I said once you can use bitcoin in your day to day purchasing, which may be decades away.

I know it’s not your job, but what is the next best website or app to move my coins from Coinbase to? I’m seeing the Coinbase warning signs all over and want out. As a extremely new investor, what should I be researching into as far as a central location to buy, store and track my coins?

Soon everyone will be accepting bitcoin. I see ride sharing giants like Uber and lyft taking coin on the regular. If they don’t already.

I agree with you on that is the absolute true benefit, but a huge number of users came here for the highly speculative market. On their way to learning the ins and outs of block chain and crypto, they will ultimately see the vast potential and implications bitcoin has. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:07:57
If we keep that trend, December 2019 will be huge. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:05:20
Lol you could read every piece on bitcoin and still lose your ass in the market. No one knows where it will go. It’s all speculation. Anyone that pretends otherwise needs to stop kidding themselves. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:38:30
You do realize that potential to profit will attract bitcoin users right?
