Fatal error. Seeing cryptocurrencies as a get rich-easy money system, means you're paving the road to suicide.Best way to approach crypto, it is by supporting cutting edge technologies (LN, Segwit) as an effort to heal all weaknesses coming out of an implementation that still is in a process of evolving into a solid infraestructure with high expectations of reaching a potential "maturing" stage.

moving between an exchange to another can be so damn expensive. What you have to consider when choosing an exchange, it is associated with customer support, processing times, FEES, safety, reputation, technologies. There are exchanges that store assets offline, which can be to your favour if any attacker pretends to harm anyone. In conclusion you must begin your own investigation in this matter and reach your own conclusions, this is just my opinion.

It is good that btc is facing this turmoil and bearish trend, it helps to get rid of noobs and those wanna be rich, and just purge the  ecosystem where only those really eager to learn blockchain, to support the technologies, to advance with investigation fostering a milestone to humanity to evolve into a new dimension in terms of IT.    Certainly btc and the blockchain are not a scam under no point of view, but are those who tried to take advantage of those who ignore the blockchain. Precisely that kind of people are getting their lesson in one way or another. BTC it is a before and after in crypto science and did an amazing job to this generation, as it was before with the first tv signal, or the first radio signal. BTC to the infinite and beyond.
