Don't worry you can do both

A timelock feature wouldn't actually save you for ~~most~~ (edit: i have no idea how many, but from what I've read about attacks, I'm guessing this is fairly common) of online wallets / exchanges / whatever.  If they implemented it properly, it would be a great idea, but the way most places work right now, it literally wouldn't even slow down the attacker.
The biggest issue is that internally, there is no "your coins" vs "someone else's coins" in most systems.  They keep an internal ledger of who has *how many* coins, but there wouldn't be a way to look at their pool of coins and say "this coin, specifically, belongs to So, let's go through an actual exploit that has been used, where the site had code that looked something like this (this should be pretty easy to understand even if you aren't a programmer):
    $balance = $user-&gt;checkBitcoinBalance();
    if ($amount_to_withdraw &lt; $balance) {
      $balance = $balance - $amount_to_withdraw;
      withdraw($amount_to_withdraw);
    }
Someone realized that they could make two, simultaneous requests to withdraw money, and one of them would be "free."  So they write some program that requests to withdraw 10 bitcoin, and also .0001 bitcoin.  The system has programs 1 and 2 executing simultaneously, so the flow goes something like:
    [1] User balance is 11 bitcoin
    [2] User balance is 11 bitcoin
    [1] Is 10 less than 11?  Yup, we'll let them withdraw
    [2] Is .0001 less than 11? Yup, we'll let them withdraw
    [1] The new balance is 11 - 10, so 1.
    [2] The new balance is 11 - .0001, so 10.9999
    [1] Send them 10 bitcoins
    [2] Send them .0001 bitcoins
It doesn't matter if YOU had a "time lockdown feature" on your account - the bitcoins are gone from the *company account*, not yours (well they are, but your account is just the unfortunate side effect).
