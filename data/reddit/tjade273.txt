State laws trump trump nonexistent federal laws

Yeah, some of the really early Ethereum contracts were pyramid schemes. There's a bunch of working ones over at r/ethdapps

You bootstrap off your current network. In a traditional business, your initial customer base often consists of people you know from other parts of life. 
When a business goes online, they often bring an existing customer base of real-world buyers with them. This leads to reputation in the new market.

So long as you don't do anything to piss them off (or happen to be black). Then they'll enforce all of their bs laws to their fullest extent.

They aren't really modifying the ledger, they are just agreeing on a new type of transition. Whether that's a good idea or not is another debate, but the blockchain is still immutable.

It's essentially an SPV client built on top of Ethereum. Anyone can run a program which fetches BTC block headers and sends them to the smart contract. The contract verifies the PoW and stores the headers. 
Other Ethereum contracts can then call the contract to get information about the BTC blockchain, and it also has a "relay" function, where you can provide a transaction and a merkle proof, and the relay verifies the transaction and sends the information to the contract you choose. 
In order to verify transactions you have to pay a small fee, which is used to incentivise the relayers.
Tl;Dr: It let's you verify that a particular transaction occurred on the BTC blockchain

Yes, the contracts still have to use the Ethereum network, and they have to pay for computation in ETH, but the value transfers can be done in BTC. In the future, the network will be upgraded to support payment in any currency, so you wouldn't necessarily need to use the ETH token at all
It's not the same as the counterparty port, which essentially just lets people use the smart contracts on their network.

You can use it to verify payments, like if I wanted to have a presale for a new Ethereum-based application, I could automatically issue tokens on Ethereum to anyone who sent bitcoin to my address.
You can also use it to construct swap contracts. I would create a contract that sends 50 ETH to the first person who sends me 1BTC.
