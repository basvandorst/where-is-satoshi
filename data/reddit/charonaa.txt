Interesting how we always end up fighting, even if someone just tries to post an objective argumentation. Guess we'll just have to let the market decide. This is like American politics: no debates, just verbal fights, not very constructive.

TUSD is further away from 1 USD than USDT. Another round of FUD fake news.

not until people get desperate and totally fed up with the whole current financial system i think. let's hope they have some money left to buy Bitcoin then...
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:59:35
no, because shorts are getting rekt, like they had it coming
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:18:15
gotta agree - that looks a bit unhealthy. still doesn't mean that Bitfinex is selling USDT. Rather its users don't trust it and prefer to hold BTC, like they should of course :) add to that the high number of shorts, getting rekt, like they should, and we have a nice avalanche. i hope tether can soon normalise usdtusd. they've done that a number of times already in similar situations, but indeed, that $0.85 wick was a bit extreme.

Easy money for attackers: Price just went up like crazy. Sell BTC. Start DDOS. Buy back BTC. We really need better protection against this.

No, he would just get more of the Bitcoins of his choice

Wasn't it like BTC1 nodes (eg on AWS) can now masquerade as Core nodes?

You can also look for the BT1BTC and BT2BTC markets on tradingview.com

That guy was a true pain in the neck. Not sure if banning him helps. He'll find other channels for his weird hobby.

not going to happen, at least on on centralized exchanges. that would add to trading fees and delays (and TX fees, as the number of onchain transactions would increase drastically). what makes exchanges fast is that you trade IOUs in their databases.

What a question! Of course everybody wants that :)

Well there may also be some people who just see that this is going to change the world, and would rather be part of it thanfighting a futile fight.

Sure, banks will survive, but their role will change, and they'll lose a lot of power. Pretty similar to post offices and brick and mortar stores...

wow, using your kinds as a bitcoin price oracle? :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:04:37
good idea. done. same for xapo

I guess someone just set a too tight market stop loss sell order...
And pulling some liquidations is his slipstream.
