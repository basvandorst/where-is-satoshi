Yeah man, make one and copy whatever you’d like as far as video picture or whatever. I’d like to see it so if you do be sure to send it to me.

My hero. lol
I used to just put Carl Sagan mp3’s in the middle of my iTunes CDs.

Thank you I really appreciate that. I made this video really quick today, I’m working on a long-form version with a lot more custom narrative 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:46:03
Thanks, I watched it once before making the vid but I've watched Carl Sagan a lot in general. I'm a fan of his. Also, french horns are badass I used to play lead chair when I was in high school its the best sounding brass instrument imo

What is amazing and frightening is that this processing-congestion could have the largest affect on the trajectory of where these coins settle at for prices.

Sorry fellas I'm not hiking up the price anymore. I already got too much money in my garage from shorting this so it must be some other whales. Check out my garage though! Thanks coinbase!!

What’s really important is the glacial research. All this bitcoin talk is just extra noise.
Here is some cool research being done on glacials:

It's not gradual in terms of any scale we are used to seeing for a stock/investment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:50
Someone kindly explain what happens next ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:28
People.. don't freak out. But like its okay to scream.

I don’t know of this club but I’m relatively new to this subreddit ��

Anyone who pretends to know is lying. But you did ask for opinions and in my opinion its not stopping anytime soon. Beanie babies never had futures traded on wall street ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:04
probably shouldn't buy until the whales have had their fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:37
Ooooo that actually sounds fun! :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:33
You like that? It was me. I can keep going if you want ;-)
