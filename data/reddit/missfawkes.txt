I closed my account on coinbase today it has gone down hill with its accessibility for Canadians who dont want to link a bank account to it, Plus they got rid of the abilty to use prepaids even though its basically money for them!  Ive join three other exchanges that are Canadian but they have rather high buy in amounts either $100 or $200 if you want to use e transfers.   The Bch news was too sleazy of a move though on coinbase's part.

but doesnt the fees for bitcoin transactions get pumped back into the bitcoin ecosystem unlike fiat atm fees which a tiny part of that fee goes to the economy and the rest goes towards paying ceos to sit on their fat asses and make new plans to rob folks blind

bitcoin gold seems way more interesting then bitcoin cash maybe because it more accessible to the average folk with out the need for a asic mining hardware unlike bitcoin cash lol. this is not advertising for bitcoin gold all im saying is it seems interesting and give it a chance.
