I wish I could prey on people's sympathies as well as you do!
You must have made a fortune on all these stupid motherfuckers.

I just tried to add this twice but it just getss stuck:








	-0.665 BTC	Withdrawal BTC to address 13zy1bCkdZyKNn2u8yVhBmTkTXqHe64aHR	12.03.12 07:25:26	


I don't think it processed. I don't have the transaction ID because I sent from BTC-E, I only have the BTC-E ID that they use internally. In the comments I added the reddit links because it shows what happened.

There is a class action lawsuit against him. I suggest getting on board, and also filing a report with his local PD for the criminal activity he is involved in. 
This should still be his current info:
Get on it.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:16:06
he can't because he has none.

It took me a while to write this, so if this text gets deleted, it will result in strengthening my position, as well as more copy pasta to use against you wherever I feel it fits, and the internet like you know is vast.
**You are a LIAR Patrick Strateman,** and several completely unrelated people have my back on this. 
I sent 0.665BTC **TO MY ACCOUNT ON YOUR SITE: HTTPS://MOMENTOVPS.COM**, that is still my 0.665BTC. It sat in **MY ACCOUNT ON YOUR SITE: HTTPS://MOMENTOVPS.COM** for services not rendered, 
THAT'S HOW IT STAYED IN MY ACCOUNT! and now you've decided it's NOT MINE?????? HOW'S THAT WORK??
How exactly does that compute in you liar brain? You've just "decided" one day it's yours, ???REALLY???? Maybe you've heard about EMAIL!!!? It's a popular way of communication I've heard. But of course you have never sent me anything. Maybe you could have written, Hey! I have 0.665BTC of yours sitting here, you know, just sitting here, I'm planning on deleting your account for no reason, so hey you want it back????? OF course you didn't! - BTW, do you even know how to use email?
(I actually would like to know why exactly you deleted my account and then took my balance without any notice whatsoever, of which didn't belong to you in the first place.)
...while you are secretly knowing damn well I couldn't transfer it out myself, and ALL of your users can attest to this back then, my BTC WAS stuck in your shitty site until YOU PATRICK STRATEMAN REMOVED IT.
Is it really that hard to be a good person, and just give back what you have taken from me? Really dude? All it took for you to become a thief Patrick Strateman is 0.665BTC, is it my fault for thinking you would you would keep my balance safe, how many others have you stolen from?
Maybe I've got this all wrong, maybe Patrick Strateman is just a complete idiot and accidentally deleted all of it? I bet that's not what you told your partners about bitcoinica!
0.665BTC Made you a Thief Patrick Strateman, then maybe you just moved onto bigger things?
Well, guess what Patrick Strateman, how does it feel to have 0.665BTC Make you a Thief? Using your logic my guess is this isn't the first time, oh wait That's right, it's not like you aren't trapped in a bunch of litigation over another theft with no evidence?
How's it feel? I personally hope it feels terrible, because then I know at least you are getting what you've deserved. (For each time, is Three on you, Patrick Strateman.)
I mean, with your logic, maybe you've been lying all along, there is now evidence here on reddit, and even if you delete or edit your post, it will never go away. but maybe it was you who robbed bitcoinica? I can just read the headlines now, OMG BIG BOLD PRINT ON CNN! **Did so called TOP SECURITY GUY PATRICK STRATEMAN ACTUALLY STOLE ALL THE BTC???**
With your logic, I wonder how Gilda would feel finding out it was actually you who did it. Hmm, my guess is she's not charging you enough Patrick, sounds like you could surely afford adding a few more zeros to her checks, I mean AT LEAST these days, knowing damn well how much of a thief and liar you are now... :(
 The reality here is I've personally provided you proof through your support system, while you have provided me nothing but continuous lies. 
**You have proved this by offering me 3.50USD??** YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME! Is this how you do all of your users?
Be assured you will never hear the end of this, until you pay back 0.665BTC you owe me. Even then because of this insult on my person, I'm very pressed NOT to add you to a few strange fetish porn mailing lists, making sure to slightly change the address but keep your name on it so of course your mom's neighbors will get it. O.o Payback is a bitch Patrick.
And you know, I bet you would not be surprised how many people I've found who just aren't as verbal as me, wishing to remain in secrecy, and loathe you just as much or even more than me, Patrick.
They call you a pathological liar, a general scumbag piece of shit and a lot more. I wish I would have know this... Before ever fucking dealing with you. 
It cost me all of 2 minutes to get the freely given details on you. If I wanted to, which I don't want to, but let's say maybe you deserved it? 
How long do you actually think it would take me, keeping in mind it only took me 2 minutes to find you. How long do you think it would actually fucking really take me, if I wanted to, to get a few of your mom's neighbors to get me even MORE intimate details about you than I already have?
Probably not too long Patrick, be sure to tell your mom, I said you are a son of a bitch. :)
Shit, you should be glad all I've spent on this is time, and I'm beginning to think about charging you for making me have to go through all of this shit to get my fucking balance back, how many months has it been now? 
Imagine what I could do with a psuedo anonymous currency some day soon being funneled through into fully anonymous currency, and sent to someone completely out of my control. Right there in your neighborhood! Wouldn't that be a Punch in the face! All it takes is time Patrick, that's all it takes. I even hear people deliver boxes of full of things these days for a small fee containing stuff you'd never want near you.
You write I'm a scammer? Maybe, I just want my fucking BTC back, you scumbag Asshole.
I'm even hoping that I can eventually delete this thread.
But as you have personally witnessed, I'm not stopping, or will I ever until you do right by me.
You can play your games, but when it comes down to it, you know I'm right and you're WRONG.
--IF you somehow get the MODS to delete this, all it proves is that I'm going to post this everywhere I can find it's relevant to be seen, which includes, EVERYWHERE these mods have no power over me.
There is a lot of people in this world, many undergrounds, who will stop at nothing to take from you, what you have taken from me. ...They don't know anything about me, as I just haven't rung them yet. 
Some people, (people all around in fact) would just not hesitate on the news of someone like you going around doing the things you do.
So when you sit there forming your reply, remember back to the time I tried contacting you multiple times last year, to which you ignored, surely you keep logs.
or maybe you don't, because then you'd have to admit how and explain why you just lied to everyone including me multiple times in just one post?
It's even possible my first figure that I sent you as an approximation with only the date and time of my registration email linking me to the account, upon notice of you deleting my account and taking my BTC was even more spot on than I realized, as I'm just not quite sure if I sent another 0.1BTC to fix a problem I may have had with a transaction fee taking away the full amount I meant to send in the first place. It's highly probable as I wouldn't have had much of a reason to send that 2nd transaction of 0.1BTC so close together. But since I sent it from an exchange meaning a communal wallet and don't fully recall and don't currently have a way of correlating it, I just can't do that.
@_date: 2013-06-14 02:41:47
patrick strateman is also a member of bitcoin police. Maybe you don't know his history but as it ever occured to you, it's highly plausible he is also one of the people whom has been going around robbing people?
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:14:43
I'm simply dragging him through the streets whenever I can. To make sure people have the chance to know who they are dealing with. If you look at it, and use just this thread as a judge, wouldn't you think anyone who downvoted this deserves to be ripped off?
I'm assuming the only reason why he hasn't been kidnapped and beaten already, is that he does owe people. 
Everytime bitcoin jumps in price, that means we have something more to go after him for.
Each time I do this, it adds another tick to his name.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:36:55
so many morons, at this point it's as if every new bitcoiner deserves getting scammed.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:45:50
Suit yourself, it was never a question of true or false. I implore you to do you own research. As far as I'm concerned you never had anything to offer to begin with.
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:02:00
I didn't mean to make you nervous. I won't tell anyone who you are, you have my word.
keep it real.
@_date: 2013-04-21 11:54:54
Well dude, with you having only been a redditor for 5 hours. Doesn't that kind of muddy your intent at helping him by making yourself look like a shill supporting me? 
I'm not using my main accounts either, knowing what I know about him of course...
but I don't need to now do I, as Patrick has already clearly stated he tried to send me $3.50 for 0.665BTC. 
That of which I've never even seen written to me, besides here in his post from his account made a year ago before he got himself into his trouble that he's currently in.
I can't even be sure it was even him that responded to me earlier, I would generally hope he's pissed for making him work on the WEEKEND! XD That Dick!
Which if it is him, and I do hope it is, I forced him to defend his thieving ass on a WEEKEND! HAH!
I don't honestly even know where he wrote that to me, if he even did, -besides in the same message he's calling this a scam and in turn calling me a liar. 
I've made so many support tickets that he's closed, actively ignoring me, I simply have no idea where he wrote that in his shitty support system. 
But really, you could have at least staked your entire reputation on it, you know, staked your entire online reputation on this guy who is indeed a thief. 
No way I'd do that for him, knowing what I now know about him, I am forced to never let him know anything more about me than what I have already given him. 
So, Instead of just being a 5 hour redditor promoting his site, maybe you should put something on the line for him, since he's the one protecting you from whatever it is you have been doing with his VPS service?
I mean I know exactly why I need layers around me, when dealing with him.
You don't just go around calling people out in the netsec world without a reason.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:57:45
I sent BTC, BTC arrived in account, BTC balance was stuck in his system presumably until he redid the site, but I honestly don't know yet when he moved it.
I'm still relearning this stuff and have forgotten how to get timestamps and transaction identifiers to find out exactly when he or someone else moved it out of the wallet it was in, but that only takes time.
I tried to contact him through IRC, and I could never get the timing right. A year later, after multiple attempts to contact him, I then find he deleted my account and took my balance, then I got pissed and switched my schedule. Went through my email to find the time period of my registration, so I would have something to look for when I went through all of my other accounts trying to find out whee I sent it from. Still, Patrick has not given me any explanation of why he did this.
After having finally contacted him with details as to time of transaction and approximate amount. (again, I couldn't remember where I sent it from at the time I was able to finally contact him.) 
...He just doesn't want to give me my balance back, he's also the only one that truly knows what it was, and I can't correlate whether of not I sent a 2nd transaction so I'm currently only asking for the 1st transaction. Even though it's possible to be slightly more, and even closer to the approximation I previously thought it was when first finally having contacted him with this.
  
Now he's trying to say BTC just magically turns into EUR, and I can't even be sure that is really his account, but it's likely.
Just to solidify my standing, his prices were indeed BTC at the time of this, or I simply wouldn't have known how much to send of have been able to send the BTC in the first place. 
and I wouldn't have a wallet address and transactions listed in the blockchain with a whole bunch of revealing timestamps as to find out when he moved it that I haven't been able to read just yet. 
So what it boils down to is, he removed or deleted my account on momentoVPS, that had a balance in it. Moved the BTC balance presumably into his own wallet, and now owes me my complete balance from that account, or bedazzled a thief as I am now actively working toward if he does not resolve it entirely. 
I've given him time to resolve this, too much time, the only reason I've brought it here is because he's ignoring me. So any ideas that I'm being too harsh on him are unfounded.
Currently Patrick Strateman is a thief, and everyone should now know this, so we can keep these people away from others, or at least make sure it's out here for them to find if they wish to do business with a thief.

As of this date and time, this entire post is currently labeled as removed (from the public). Now I can only assume coercion on behalf of the moderators, being as how this has 21 upvotes currently.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:16:55
then where is my time for my VPS?????? 0.665BTC gives how much time?
@_date: 2013-06-14 03:58:08
I thought you made it apparent you didn't care, the first time we talked in private.
I also don't take kindly to character assassination. 
I don't need to show my cards or explain anything to anyone whom makes no difference whatsoever.
Most of this isn't taking place on the internet at all.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:08:08
I sent BTC, BTC was stuck in his system. A year later, after multiple attempts to contact him, I find he deleted my account and took my balance.
BTC doesn't just magically turn into EUR like he's trying to say.
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:08:08
 sent 0.665BTC to this address on 12.03.12 07:25:26:
to purchase 1 month subscription for a VPS. On the order page his tables were F'd up which stated 0.665 was only for 1 week. 
I decided against using momentoVPS, and was unable to contact him directly. The 0.665BTC stayed in that wallet for a long time until he took it.
Once I realized the price was coming back, I went to log in and find my account gone, as well as the 0.665BTC had moved from the wallet.
I was able to finally contact him through IRC, PhantomCircuit told me to make a new account, forcing me to agree to new terms in the process, and I gave as much info as I had at the time only for him to mock me over being confused by his shitty layout. 
I've tried contacting him many times through IRC, of those many times he has banned me promptly every time, and no longer responds to any new support tickets, even after I found the proof I couldn't find previously.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:23:28
He stole 0.665~ from me, even admitted it in public. As well as having stolen from many many others.
@_date: 2013-06-11 22:11:17
his vps service, I had an account on his vps service.
I made account, sent 0.665 BTC, then noticing I didn't have enough for a month I sent another amount that I am having trouble finding the transaction for. (as I have many accounts, like we all do)
There was a discrepancy between week price and month price, and so I declined.
I tried to contact patrick for him to send back the BTC, through IRC and he was literally never around.
If you look through his account here he has tried to lie several different times:
Here is an archive of the pricelist from the time I sent the BTC, (although it is not correct):
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:29:18
You bought while it's up.
**Put them in your own wallet on your own HDD, transfer the wallet.dat file to 3 different forms of hard media, put them in a safe, uninstall bitcoin and delete the wallet.dat, do a secure wipe of free space and Forget about them.**
That is the only way you will not lose.

In the future it would be wise of you to be more kind to your neighbors.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:18:11
A couple years having studied the market and the HFT bot they use.
Basically I know exactly how they work, it's host parasite symbiosis and I guarantee you once a certain amount of new liquidity is hit, the price will tank. Sending at least half of the new blood to sell back to the guys who sold it to them.
...and if they don't sell, the price will drop continually until they do.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:36:03
I agree kind of went on a tangent, but could you check to see if the entire post has been removed? When I log out it's labeled as removed.

Bitcoin separates idiots from their money, good luck proving me wrong.

@_date: 2013-06-13 21:54:23
No idea what you are speaking of. Detail it. Drop as many as you want, make it indexable and not an anecdote. 
As long as they are real names of course. We can and will collectively destroy these people. The people that stay quiet are worthless. Not much use without Real Names. 
When you find them put them on PB and anywhere else, google indexes, and make it permanent.
The only thing that keeps bad people doing bad things, is good people doing nothing and being lazy.

Just wondering if anyone found out who it was, that's all. I've been in and out of this game for over 2 years. I was an early adopter. I've been gone for awhile and was curious if anyone found out who it was.
long story short. 1 or 2 people control all of bitcoin, that's how it is, that's how it will always be.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:48:28
Heh, you don't have to wait that long. I'm just saying you will be tempted to play with it, and if you do, it will be stolen from you.
When it starts dropping, don't sell.
It will more than likely go under 100 once enough new people have bought in.
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:07:20
I was looking through your history just now, white, homosexual, makes hiphop probably also an engineer, on fetlife, enjoys MMA, very impulsive, very obnoxious, smoke a lot of herb.
Would you like to go kick someone's head in for me?
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:46:08
I'll get downvoted for this because PhantomCircuit is in line with the secret circle but MomentoVPS, Patrick Strateman basically stole 0.665BTC from me personally, by not giving it back.
Patrick Strateman is also currently trapped in litigation being sued from being a part of Bitcoinica. So he's understandably now a thief and a crook.
