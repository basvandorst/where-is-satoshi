How is it life changing? What has change about you life? You’re paying taxes, insurance and maintenance that is like $300-400 less per month than when you were paying rent? That’s not life changing, sorry. That’s really nice, but you’re not changing your job or your spending or anything at all because of it. It’s just....nice.
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:06:14
I’ve been trying to play catch up on crypto as I’ve been out for the last year. Trying to make up my mind on Lightning vs Bitcoin Cash. Have watched several videos including the debate between Lee and Ver. Any insight or updates that aren’t political?

What do you mean? I really want understand this. Lines?
@_date: 2019-03-02 12:32:45
Because this allows them to fill their machine with cash and therefore causes the machine to require less maintenance.

Doubt it. I agree 1% is nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-21 05:04:56
No it’s not life changing. It might offer temporary relief to people who are broke and suffering but it doesn’t last a life time. Give me the case where it’s life changing for “a lot of people”. And please steer clear of edge cases cause you and I are both talking about “a lot of people”. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:35:59
That’s exactly what I’m talking about. People who live paycheck to paycheck (don’t save) will not be changed by 100k. They’ll spend it. If they saved money they’d absolutely save 100k well before 60.
@_date: 2019-03-14 01:18:06
What on earth are you talking about that didn’t happen 
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:36:19
Look, I’m not saying BTC doesn’t have good gains! I profited as well! I’m saying if you follow the advice of “only put in 1%” it’s not going to change your life.

Lightning network 
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:29:40
Well, first of all I never said “only 100k”— I DID say that 100k is not life changing money which is very different than talking about your salary or attacking in any way. Secondly, now I feel like you’re trying to have a dick measuring contest about your salary which is petty, but, since you asked, I make two to four times that amount depending on the year. At 29 I hit 385k in salary and right now I’m taking a year off work so technically I’ll make zero this year in active income but dividends and capital gains on my investments will float me all year (and could float me the rest of my life if I don’t go overboard with expenses). Let me know if you have any other loaded, condescending questions?
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:29:41
Yes If you got a 100x on your investment which you absolutely didn’t so don’t even try to say you did ��

I’m not saying the concept of a wheelbarrow being worth more than the money in it is a tall tale. I understand hyperinflation and I understand why money has worth. I’m saying the story about the wheelbarrow being stolen is likely a tall tale.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:32:20
This is a common story about many countries who go through hyperinflation. I heard it about Zimbabwe. Makes me think it’s a tall tale.
@_date: 2019-03-21 04:01:16
So that’s 5.2 bitcoin in one year. 5.2 bitcoin was about 100k USD in its peak. Even if you doubled that, 200k is not life changing money for most and certainly not for someone who makes 100k/yearly. Point is 1% is nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-22 01:31:00
And if you’re making 400k/ year (which you claim to be making close) then you’d pay of your mortgage in 1-2 years anyhow without your moonshot 100x investment. Give me a break lollll

@_date: 2019-03-21 04:52:49
I’m with you dude! I bought a bunch in 2013-2015 and sold almost all 6000 average (sold some at 2000 and all the way up to 18k). I made enough to retire with that (got obsessed with the FIRE subreddit and learning about the 4% rule). Even after paying insane money in taxes, that has been life changing money for me so I’ve experienced it fully and hope for others to as well! I still own some BTC and am a cheerleader for the tech and (selfishly) the price.
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:36:26
Oh- I hadn’t considered that. Was bitcoin that fast and cheap when it started too?

Do you always ask questions you know the answer to?
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:41:52
There’s no magic threshold. It depends on how much you value $1,000. If that’s your life savings, take it off coinbase and hold your own keys. It’s unlikely that a company as large as coinbase fails, but shit happens and you don’t want to be wishing.
However, for some people $1,000 is not much to worry about so they may say, I’ll leave up to 10k, 100k or whatever on coinbase. It’s relative bro.
@_date: 2019-10-21 04:00:34

Why is it more beneficial to have these features on the first layer than the second layer? Take the internet. This is not my expertise, but from what I understand, it has been built layer by layer on top of old protocols. Simply because we have so many people/machines using the old protocols that, to abandon and start from scratch, would be unproductive because of the network effect. 
So many people use bitcoin that it makes sense for them to stay if we can build on top of it rather than trying to start a new network, no?

Like I told you: google “sequence of returns”. Average doesn’t mean it’s consistently 9.9%— some years it’s down 5% and other years it’s up 20%. You don’t get to take out the “average” of 9.9% on the years the market returns less than that and still keep your principal. 
The safe withdrawal rate with near guaranteed lifelong success is around 4%/year of a starting portfolio that’s mostly invested in S&amp;P low cost indexes. If you’re not trolling, I hope you educate yourself on this and you can actually retire early and retire with realistic numbers and strong change of success (not running out of money). Check out r/FinancialIndependence for an entire subreddit dedicated to this. I’ve read it every day for over a year, listened to countless podcasts and audiobooks about the subject of withdrawals and retirement. If you’re just trolling, then I hope my messages can at least educate someone else who reads them. Cheers man.
@_date: 2019-02-03 02:41:15
Honestly I think it’s super confusing right now too but I think you’re going to look back on this comment and laugh. Early internet was way too complicated for most people too.

I did a bit of looking at your comments. It's clear that you're a gambler who thinks he's an investor. You made a lot of money speculating and now that inflates your ego cause you've got a lot of money. It's really ALL you've got going for you. Deep down that sentence hurts a little cause you know it's true. You realized that money does not solve your problems and it does not give you friends (aside from the women you're willing to pay). I know this cause I've experienced it and am working to heal myself as well, though I never made it to the level of asshole that you are. I myself made enough money to retire early (currently taking a year sabbatical at 31 with $2.5MM). That may not be as you have but it is certainly enough for me to live the rest of my life without worrying about money. So, now my mission is to make sure that I don't turn into someone like you who is filled with so much misery he takes it out on the internet. I get it dude. I really do. I've got "fuck you" money as well, I just don't walk around telling it to everyone.

100% true and annoying. I’ve been ~~obsessed~~ interested in this tech since 2012-2013. Was the (annoying) guy who told all his friends about it and everyone made fun of my interest. Then in 2017, those same people were explaining why Ripple is the next big thing (cause they bought some).
Also, podcasters I’ve been listening to for years went from “crypto is a joke” to “you need a crypto coach”. And now— everyone is quiet again. I much prefer the quiet times where people are talking about the development over the price.

What’s the next ATH?
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:43:23
I honestly don’t ever want to, so hopefully it does guarantee my freedom from “getting permission” to do things I want. To each their own.
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:50:20
General consensus is to use a hardware wallet like a savings account and phone wallet as checking/spending.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:40:14
That's like saying the 50% odds of heads and tails don't mean anything to "that particular quarter".
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:02:21
In the future, add line breaks for easier reading.
@_date: 2019-12-14 08:11:14
Yes, but imagine you are the victim of what you think is an obvious scam and you think that the perpetrator is running free out there. You may know that you are not getting your money back, but wouldn’t you want to know that the perpetrator was brought to justice?

Yeah, I guess if you're lucky and A.) the woman has more assets and B.) the courts favor the guy.

Hehe ��
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:33:02
Yeah dude. You're literally playing the odds that you're gonna lose half your shit some day. So stupid to get married.

How the hell is that sexist? Cause I didn't match the statement with an equivalent statement about how he's gonna cheat on her too? Get real...
@_date: 2019-04-06 02:34:08
Happy to have a supporter of bitcoin spreading the word but this guy is a terrible speaker and I hate that he’s representing bitcoin.

I love watching these. Watching huge projects like this scaled down to a cellular level is fascinating and makes me appreciate those who are fascinated by and interested in contributing. It’s like watching insects, some of these guys are really worker bees, jumping from project to project to help. So fucking cool.
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:01:51
One of the worst attempts at meme humor I’ve ever seen.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:02:28
Again, it's not sexist to say someone's gonna cheat. Both men and women cheat. I picked her as an example cause we were talking about the ring.
@_date: 2019-04-21 05:42:55
You retire because you’ve saved and invested enough money to, at extremely high odds, have a standard of living for the rest of your life and never run out of funds. So yeah, those guys are not going to “invest” in a highly speculative asset that has a shot at blowing up their retirement and sending them back to work.
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:26:51
That doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:36:30
No idea who that is. Sounds smart. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:37:49

He’s so awful in TV interviews. He looks like a goon and he’s a terrible orator. He makes people who use bitcoin look like losers.

When he gets divorced, the state has the power to assign half his shit to that woman.

Yes my question was laden with sarcasm. Nobody knows the next ATH.
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:08:22
Ya you dummy
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:26:18
There was a 6 percent drop in hetero divorces in 2018, but experts think that's cause less people are choosing not to get married.
@_date: 2019-04-13 03:56:07
Bout to start doing the same. What’s your best method of weekly buys? Cash app? Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:44:45
So she’s not asking him not to buy BTC if her mind is easily changed by a wasabi bet. That’s fucking dumb.
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:35:56
Lol. Using the sociopolitically trendy word "toxic" is a dead giveaway you're young and naive (or worse, old and naive.)
@_date: 2019-04-30 09:05:09
ya duh
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:08:31
Might need to hire an engineer or mathematician which could be expensive. Better wait til bitcoin reaches 100k, or wait...50k? 30k? Shit, how are we gonna figure this out?
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:37:47
See you at r/mgtow in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:37:18
This is stupid dude. The guy made a muted palette on purpose why would you try to mess with his art and imply you made them at all better? Plus you rasterized and baked in a white BG. No help at all. I politely request you remove this post and let the guy who made it have the spotlight.

You don't like someone's opinion so you pick a random insult and try to dig huh? Your assumption of me is wayyyyy off. You're in a bitcoin sub too yunno...
@_date: 2019-04-06 23:23:58
Yea there’s been like 4 or 5 major rises and crashes. People were made millionaires 4-5 times. The odds are better that there’s more juice left

I bet you live in a first world country and have easy access to banking. You’re on the wrong side of history.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:50:25
They’re not generating nothing. They generated a platform that attracted an audience. That’s huge.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:00:54
O ok
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:50:42
Now you’re getting it!
@_date: 2019-01-20 01:50:15
And that’s why they charge a fee. People don’t want to do that work. Same reason it costs more to eat a meal in a restaurant than to cook it yourself at home. Now, whether that fee is too high? That’s for the market to decide. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 04:57:43
He/she is not talking about the halving he’s talking about the dramatic market value fluctuations.

He was joking because the poster above him wrote 2017.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:12:59
To laugh at someone else’s suffering is so evil. That’s extreme financial loss no matter who you are. Fuck you— I hope one day you get rich and then lose it all.
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:21:14
Hey dude it was a joke
@_date: 2019-01-18 03:47:40
Agree— we’re 80+% off the high and bitcoin has been known to go back up eventually. Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results but it gives you a hint.
@_date: 2019-01-31 01:22:47
He’s in the bull pen, just not scheduled.
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:14:48
Well now I disagree. I don’t think it’s fake internet money. I just think people are too optimistic about price. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 12:17:04
You didn’t have 1.9MM cause you didn’t sell your asset when it was at 20k. You had 100 BTC then and you have 100 BTC now.
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:32:55
Got a real good chuckle out of me.
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:18:42
Original joke dude!
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:02:57
Don’t fomo shame me.
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:20:55
Don’t wanna try to solve this but I’ve always loved this use of BTC. Whether this one is real or not :)

*Many people in this sub.
I like bitcoin, think it will grow and understand why it’s important but you’re lying to yourself if you conclude that bitcoin is a “conservative” investment. It’s volatile, high-risk and speculative. Close this thread.
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:03:37

@_date: 2019-05-09 13:27:39
Yea man, me asking people to anonymously tell me if and why they have over 100k USD in bitcoin is exactly like that. Those are great examples.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:37:13
We’ve just successfully completed 3 of 4 G-Waves. If we get the 4th today we’re on a straight ride to 17k.

Forbes lost all credibility when it let “contributors” write articles for them. It’s all self promotion and non-expert opinions.
