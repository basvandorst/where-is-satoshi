While I agree with you, all we can see is him crying. We will never know for sure if this was him showing actual emotions or faking them. But why would we waste our time even discussion it?
First of all, we currently have our own problems to solve and even if we wanted to focus on Roger in our spare time, this guy has done alot of very shady shit. I'd rather focus on him as he's actively trying to manipulate the market for his personal wealth instead of him fake crying in an interview.

If you have to pay 100€ fee and it still complains about that the minimal fee is not met, your transaction uses tons of inputs, doesn't it?

TIL that in the entire world, there is only one currency: USD. 
Maybe you want to talk about how great state currencies work with some people living in venezuela.

No. First of all, Bitcoin is not centralized. So no one can simply say we're making a change now. Multiple indepentend companies and individuals have to agree to follow along with the plan to increase the size of the blocks.
And if this would happen, it would not send any coin to 0. I don't think it would change the market too much as most coins have other specialized use cases other than faster transactions. And coins that simply rely on the fact that they confirm faster and haver lower transaction fees often have a base which follow that specific coin like a religion. They'll always find something they don't like / hate about other coins.

I dislike him as much as the next guy but trying to bash somebody because he's crying over innocent people being killed for no reason at all is kind of stupid.

So, everything is a ponzi scheme?

You're right about that. It will most likely not change anything. Yet trying to blame someone for crying will not help anybody here. I can already smell his personal fanbase preparing their pitchforks because here over at we make fun of people showing empathy.
Everybody here pretty much knows what kind of person this guy is and I think it would be better for everybody to focus on his actual shady promotion of Bitcoin Cash and call him out.

This subreddit is focused on Bitcoin, not Bitconnect. You might want to visit other subreddits to find an answer to your question.

First of all, pretty much every question regarding the block size has been answered in great depth multiple times already. Also as you already said, it was an automated response. 
Looking at the new posts in there are plenty of posts regarding technical questions which are actively discussed and not removed.
Maybe rephrase your question or try to use google and see if it has been already answered.
