So? During the original gold rush, can you imagine if only 10 people went and mined while everyone else sat at home and talked about how stupid and meaningless gold was? It would be pretty ridiculous right? What if they then had the *audacity* to complain that those miners had 100% of the wealth? Wouldn't that be a mind-blowing, historicized example of a false sense of entitlement?
900 people own over half of Bitcoins and they deserve them because they had the **balls** to actually go in neck deep. So it was with the men who hunted lions and crossed oceans, so it is with those who embrace technology!

There is limited land, but vast reserves of wealth. Corporations can buy out land from the owners to build the roads, and pay them based on the importance of that area. They can't use force, but they can be pressured with massive buyouts and local discontent. One way or the other, the roads will get built. That is not a concern.
If a bunch of minorities are denied a service, they can simply use a different one. Company A tells the old Asian woman she can't drive on their road, so she drives on the Adjacent one from Company B that will let her drive on it for the same or lower price. It's very simple.

The actual question is who will reject the slave-labor roads on principle in favor of the nicer, well-maintained private roads. The answer is me. I use private roads every single day, and so do millions of other people, and so would everyone else if the state didn't use violence to try to monopolize the industry.
It will be resolved in favor of the public because that's who will be paying to use it. If that road doesn't get any drivers, that corporation doesn't get any money. So the competition will always be driven toward making the roads as consumer-friendly as possible until all the evil entities adapt or die.
And what the hell is with this claim that the free market somehow depends on threats of violence and incarceration? Do you know what the word "free" even means? That isn't the free market, that is government, that is taxation, that's the devil. God I feel like I'm just going on and on now.
What I'm talking about is the **natural state of mankind, free from superstitious belief in magical "authorities**. And the internet has caused a sharp decline in religion, the other major superstitious institution, as well as trust in the establishment, since reports of their fucking evil and philosophical exchange is waking everyone up to the fact that nobody has the right to do what these monsters do. And it's a pretty bold thing to say that nobody cares, when literally millions and millions if not billions worldwide are active to stop this, by refusing to support it and campaigning to destroy it. It's also pretty bold to support taxation while simultaneously decrying the other equally evil behaviors of the entity that imposes it.

@_date: 2014-01-04 07:43:00
a) This is NOT the same as taxation because it is not forced and anyone can opt out and simply be denied the service should it come to fruition.
b) Toll roads would dominate the land. However, as an obscenely profitable business, competition would reduce prices to some negligible fraction of a payment.




I can explain it very easily. A long time ago, someone realized that human labor was extremely valuable. He wanted to own the fruits of it, but realized nobody would voluntarily give him a considerable fraction of their yields in exchange for nothing at all, or some shittily built road. So he threatened a man at spear-point and took his crops/animals/house/etc. People learned that humans feared death and would consciously avoid it, if it meant succumbing to the whims of maniacs. So entire villages cooperated to decimate other local tribes. This seemed acceptable because it was a time where communication was very difficult, philosophy hadn't even started yet, and technology was extremely primitive. People then developed superstitious fears and consequently, subservience to "authority". The process was running smoothly until the powers fucked up by allowing the internet into everyone's hands. Which is exactly what will prevent the power structures from forming again. The internet. The mass exchange of ideas tends to facilitate the survival of the logically coherent ones over time. It's Darwin.

Okay, I'll admit, I laughed at that first observation there. But now on to the actual retching anemic excuse for a point that I have to disprove.
In my analogy, **the bully was the taxman, not an anarchist!** In real life anarchy, if a taxman comes for me, he is seen for what he is, a thug. And I tell him to leave with a gun in my hand, and my money is safe for another day. In real life government, the taxman has massive forces of militarized police and pop media propaganda on his side, so submission is the second best option beside leaving the damn country.
I'll ignore your completely inappropriate invocation of racism and misrepresentation of Somalia's government and move on. In my Voluntarist society, the thing that stops that from happening is the thing that has always stopped that from happening in enlightened areas of the world. The Non Aggression Principle. Very straightforward. You can do literally anything you want without physically attacking or threatening another person and his freewill. It isn't moral superiority, it just having the baseline moral that's allowed us to evolve in the first place. The one moral that to be without is to be medically considered a psychopath, or politically, a leader.

"Authority", when used in reference to government, is not used as a synonym for "expert". It is actually used to describe someone whose commands are to be enforced with guns. Specifically, "authority" is the *right* to pass on edicts that are backed with violence and threats of violence.
I claim that "authority" does not exist, because nobody has that right and nobody can, because the very concept of that right is logically impossible.
If I told you that I am allowed to rob you and that all of your things are mine, would you just accept it and give in to my demands? Probably not. What if I said I had the "authority" or the *right* to do it? You may ask who gave me that right. If I claimed that I gave myself the right, you would think I was crazy. If I claimed that the ownership of your things is to be decided democratically, and a majority of some people you've never met all agreed that your things belong to me, you still would not believe that it is legitimate, because other people cannot consent on your behalf. What if I claimed that God gave me permission to own your things and He decided that I was an "authority" over you? You would ask for proof, which I wouldn't be able to provide.
The thing about "authority", is that it can only be supported by those three things: self-empowerment, democracy, and God. But all of them are logically inconsistent attempts to legitimize what "authority" really is, which is someone who is willing to use violence to get what they want.
When people say "tax authorities" instead of what they really are by logically consistent standards, which is "theft mafia", then that gives them an air of legitimacy that doesn't actually exist and is far more dangerous than any other superstition.

And as surely as those inarguable facts are true, it is equally true that if you are aware of these facts, and choose not to participate, that you will not receive the payoff that those who did participate did receive. Whether the payoff is then "manipulated" is *entirely* the prerogative of the person who owns it, and if others don't like it, they shouldn't have allowed him to earn all the available resources, by offering honest, non-coercive competition.

If governments decided to outlaw Bitcoin, ignoring the complete impossibility, lack of sustainability, and futility of such an action, people certainly wouldn't resort to the dead economy of government-issued monopoly money. Assuming the mass of humanity is so cowardly that they:
* Refuse to revolt (which wouldn't be necessary given the inherent secrecy of cryptocurrency) against a tiny fraction of a percent of the population.    
* Sell off instead of waiting on the inevitable self correction of the market.
They'll definitely reissue their bitcoins into a different cryptocurrency that has not been outlawed. And if that one is also outlawed, another will take its place until all cryptocurrencies are banned, and there is no feasible, imaginable way of enforcing something like that on even an individual basis, much less a world of 7.5 billion individuals. Government intervention is pretty much a losing battle here.
The China incident is actually a great example of why Bitcoin will survive any kind of attack at all. Their government completely forbid Bitcoin's use in business transactions. And when you take into account the massive population of China and the fact that it essentially is just a huge business, you have to be left in amazement at the fact that Bitcoin's value never went below 500, and it's recovered back to 1000 in under **one month**.
I seriously doubt the U.S. government could pull off such a huge restriction, and even if they did, the market would still correct itself and adapt to continue on its journey to being the measure of value for the new age.

There is a lot of bad attitude in this thread and it stems from misunderstanding the core concept of Bitcoin.
Too many comments are full of doom and gloom from posters who fear that taxes WILL come and regulations WILL come and laws WILL come. These fears are completely unfounded because they ignore one very, very important fact.
**Government intervention is not possible. This is not something that can be stopped.**
In order to enforce a tax or regulation, the powers that be first must be able to pin down offenders. They must be able to find out who is violating their rules, and punish them. (This is theoretical. I'm well aware of the emerging police state in the U.S. that detains without cause or with fabricated cause)
The problem with enforcing taxes and regulations on Bitcoin users is that it is **fully anonymous** and **unbreakably so**. The IRS cannot set an appropriate tax rate on an income that cannot be verified unless they go around demanding access to a mostly innocent population's wallets at gunpoint, and that *still* wouldn't work against blockchain users who can simply uninstall their wallet at a moment's notice and recover it on another device. This would also stir up major civil unrest that would threaten the last bit of power they will be able to nibble at. When the actions of the innocent perfectly mirror those outside the system, there is no way of enforcing these arbitrary claims to power. The Federal Government cannot enforce business regulations for the exact same reasons. They cannot reasonably ask for honest rates of income and spending when the entire money system is anonymous, and cannot be exposed.
Furthermore, [it would be impossible to break the encryption of the network,]( and to require the submission of reports from U.S. bank accounts would be completely futile when the accounts can be manipulated by buying and selling coins.
All in all, this new crypto-economy is here to stay, and they can kick and scream all they want along the way, but at the end of the day, all that happened was they made the new system take a marginally longer time to come to its inevitable full fruition.

I can't tell if that comment was in correct opposition to the free rider fallacy or was ignorantly in favor of it. Either way, the free rider "problem" really isn't a problem at all if you donate a little critical thought and trace amounts of imagination to solving it.
In a voluntarist society, the "benefits" that were illegitimately funded, such as corroded highways under perpetual construction and buildings used for academically declining compulsory "education", become commonly owned, granting every person his natural right to do with it as he sees fit. If a man decides to set off tons of TNT to blow the highway to bits, as long as nobody was killed or injured, that was his prerogative, and was inevitable. When everyone has an equal stake in something, some maniac will naturally want to ruin it for everyone. This however, is not a flaw in Voluntarism but is actually a flaw with **socialism** and **communism**, which are the natural results of any kind of **statism**. The obvious solution is for someone to build his own, privately owned and funded road to replace the coercively owned and funded road. Would it be a pain for a time? Yes, but we would adapt. Simple Darwinism really.
It stamps out monopoly and causes these "free rider benefits" to turn into competitive markets.
I really am baffled that so much theory is required to explain why its wrong, no matter what, to mug people. That is something I would imagine children would understand without any understanding of economics. But as statists are far too evil to be upheld to the moral integrity of small children, and the people that swallow loads of statist propaganda and beg for more aren't nearly on the intellectual level of small children, I'll explain this situation with a very simple analogy.
When the big mean schoolyard bully comes and steals all the weaker kids' lunch money and buys himself a vey big meal, but gives the crumbs to those poor little kids, eventually one of those little kids will have had enough and refuse to give over his lunch money. He's going up against a big mean bully who will try to beat him up, but he's still brave. But the other victims don't stand with him to protect their money. Instead, they call him a "free rider" when the bully gives the brave kid some crumbs and demands more lunch money. The brave boy then calls the other children collectivist morons and begins buying his lunch before he comes to school using Bitcoin.

The comment you said that to pretty well summed it up.
Taxation is slavery, and voluntarism would be superior to taxation in literally any endeavor you can think of.
So yes, taxes are a very bad thing. They are the modern day prima nocta. Regardless of whether they are "necessary" or not, nobody has the right to collect them or to impose their collection on anyone dissident to the tax system.
Aggressive violence is not okay regardless of the possible outcomes.

The posters on are willfully ignorant of the Libertarian ideals that gave rise to Bitcoin and continue to sustain it. Your appropriate backlash will not be accepted here because reddit can't have more than one sugar in their coffees at a time.
Fuck states!

Yes, if that person owns that land, he can build a road on it if he chooses. He would come into possession of land that was once owned exclusively by the federal government much like a pioneer would, by staking it out and claiming it. The same way any land comes to be owned. In this legitimate road service, he would be perfectly free to tell that car full of gay-looking teenagers to turn around, but his **road would get Darwinned**, because people would naturally start driving on the ones that allowed gays and anyone else to drive on them. And if a major private road was shut down for a day, people would presumably just take one of the many, many privately owned competitors because once the monopoly on illegitimate roads are a thing of the past, legitimate roads will become an incredibly profitable industry.

Yes of course the internet would "work". The state isn't making it work now. They're holding it back, just like everything else.
The fact that computers and the internet are good doesn't justify the means. They would have been invented one way or the other because of demand. And I've heard of children being born of gang rape, that the mothers loved enough to mean more than the internet. Does that make the rape okay? Of course not. Taxes are no different.

Not really. Laws and enforcement are the same imaginary thing. Something is only illegal as long as there is an evil scumbag who is rich enough to buy out the morals of hired guns to go and throw people in cages for not submitting to the whims of the rich. If that gun won't be hired it's not illegal. If that gun *can't* do his job, it's perfectly fair game, which here is the case.

A gang of thugs won't do that because people just don't do that naturally. Especially in the 21st century. We have advanced technology that gives whistleblowers and defense agencies the ability to see an attack coming for days, from people who don't know the terrain, against people with weapons that do. I don't know where this "monopoly on murder means there isn't any murder" thing comes from. It simply isn't true.

Every genocide in history except for the one on Neanderthals was Government pushed, endorsed, supported, constructed, and funded.

This entire discussion hinges upon the assumption that the initiation of violent force on innocent people is sometimes okay. When you refuse to provide that that is **ever** okay, the discussion gets much simpler. "Taxable", "asset", "gains", and "paradigms" are meaningless words that assume that this violent power structure we live under has the right to behave as such.

If you're not at the forefront of the generation's hashing power, you're wasting your time and money. The 2th/s Terraminer from Cointerra is 6k but the only one that's going to make any substantial amount of money.

False accusation of falsehood. This validity of this equivalence is unknown at the moment, and so it cannot be called false equivalence as it is not demonstrably false.
