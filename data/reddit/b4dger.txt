I did read.  I even quoted it in my comment.  You can't say tx's != usage and then in the **very next comment**, say they do.


Until you source this, it's speculating.  Many places that accept bitcoin also accept litecoin.
p.s. I don't give two shits about dogecoin (or litecoin or any alt for that matter).  As far as I'm concerned they're just playgrounds for technology and trading them is just a way to obtain more bitcoin.

Yes.  Exactly what the soccer mom in Ohio is thinking when she shops for perfume.

Did I just click a link that took me to Twitter which had a link to take me back to Reddit?  Is this officially a circle jerk now?

I'm a fan boy and you're right.  Can't believe someone actually said "money responsibility" for the notion of putting your extra savings into an extremely volatile investment.  But hey, at least in the US you can declare up to $3,000 in investment losses which, I'm sure a lot of people will be doing this year.
Edit:  Downvote me all you want, it's no where near responsible to "**invest**" in a market that has seen 50% losses this year alone.  Any financial manager will tell you you're stupid for doing so.  But, nah...to the moon!

So - transactions imply use when it's bitcoin, but nothing else.  Gotcha.  Just gotta make sure I get the circle jerk right.  I have to admit, it's pretty hard when you contradict yourself.

Yet just 3 weeks ago there was this post (and others) which try to say the exact opposite - that transactions do = usage:

I am, but that's only because I've doubled my stack by trading. But yes, that's obviously not the norm.

It's really quiet.  The only noise that the miner makes is with the cooling "radiator" fans.  I actually had it in my living room before buying a house.  Doesn't make much more noise than a regular little desk fan (maybe not even that).  The miner stays about ~40°C.  I keep my house at 75 in the summer (in the southern US where it's hot as shit in the summertime).

Sounds like a great system depending on how you look at it.

I bought a liquid cooled antminer C1 last year.  It gets me about .01 BTC per day on average (1Th/s).  Using 800watts at the wall and given the current difficulty, I'm about breaking even daily.

Except "acronymous" is an adjective and OP used it as a noun.  I knew what it was, I was just poking fun because he/she really should have used "acronym" or else reworded their sentence.

Yes.  If you read the docs, they gave an example:

That's it.  Hiding every post that has GBTC in it.  Tired of a post every fucking time a trade is made and then inevitably the same question, "Why are they paying so much when they could get them for less on exchanges?" EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.

I didn't have to give bitfinex any info.  I just signed up, transferred bitcoin there, and began margin trading.  Now, if you want to be able to deposit/withdraw USD, then yes, you'll have to send appropriate ID, etc.
