Each wallet is distinct to each account 
My wallet address cannot be your wallet address 
It’s your responsibility to safeguard the details of your wallet address
Do you hodl, trade or mine?
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:37:10
Because I’m a risk taker
It was a but expensive but who’s making profits now; This guy��

Bitcoin transactions are not anonymous 
Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy

Hodling bitcoins is good but when the bitcoin value drops you would make a loss. While trading on the other hand is a very good way of handling bitcoins as you could make lots of profit from it but still there are many disadvantages of trading such as Little Historical Support and Resistance Levels, Market Sentiment is Not Fixed, Uncertainty about Hard Forks and Bitcoin’s Internal Direction and these could lead to loss beyond margins
I’d advise you mine bitcoins because of the numerous advantages such as:
Mining can make you a solid profit depending on the ROI%.
You could still realise profits regardless of the dip in bitcoin value
You won’t need to depend on the inflation of bitcoin value to make profits as you make profits every allocated time

The blockchain mining network which has its mining server set up in Iceland is the best because Iceland has very cheap electricity and very cold weather which makes its the best place to mine bitcoin on a large scale.
Blockchain Mining network enables you mine efficiently and earn coins without owning any of the required machinery.
    The best blockchain mining server is designed to operate mining on a fail-proof protocol. 
To this effect, your bitcoin cannot be lost. 
By mining remotely your funds never leave your possession(your wallet) .
This way you are completely secured
Also, once incorporated into the bitcoin core network, your bitcoins would not change in value, they would only grow in amount as your mining progresses.
You saying I have a lot to learn is an insult to my profession 
Please let’s be guided
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:55:00
Yes it could go right up 
But what if it was at $15k 
Dips to $8k 
But later rises up to just $10k
A loss is still a loss
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:46:34
Or you could mine those bitcoins instead
I mined bitcoins and I’m making profits instead of loses as bitcoin dropped��
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:38:37
No 
Not at all
But hodl won’t really give you maximum profits as it’s being affected by factors such as inflation and deflation of the bitcoin value
Trading too has its disadvantages
But mining your bitcoin you could make maximum profits depending on the mining firm ROI regardless
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:48:12
You could either hodl, trade or mine bitcoins or you could do all if you’re capable but I’d suggest mining bitcoins as you could generate profits from bitcoins depending on the ROI%.

If bitcoin gains more popularity I think it will be a world known currency and could be used in other sectors of the economy such as transport sector education sector e.t.c.

Your address remains the same 
Goodluck on hodling but you could lose money if bitcoin value drops. Being a noob doesn’t mean you can’t mine. If you decide to mine I would suggest you mine with GREENTEK. I could link you up but hodling is still good too
Best of luck buddy����❤️
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:10:25
Just mine your bitcoins and make profits
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:55:37
But some companies do mine
I could link you up if you’re interested
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:42:16
No it isn’t
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:56:18
You could use local bitcoins and buy directly from blockchain 
Do you want to hodl, trade or mine?
I’d advise you mine bitcoins as your profits made won’t be hampered by the deflation of bitcoin value.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:58:08
Hey buddy do not sell your bitcoins 
You could make profits from mining bitcoins.
Why do you want to sell your bitcoins?
