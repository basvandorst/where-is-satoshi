Bisq is a decentralized exchange, so their is no "they" it's a "we".
You have P2P options such as electrum.
You can also use bitcoin ATM's.  But before you do, you should find a bitcoin ATM from this site and check out the reviews: [
Some of those ATM's might require AML/KYC etc, stay away from those such as coinstar atm's.  If you find a nearby atm
If an ATM near you has not been reviewed, you should test it out with a small amount first.  If they try to blackmail you with AML/KYC, then you can walk away having lost only a little.  It's blackmail if you put money into the machine, and they have no cancel option to cancel the transaction if they demand ID.
We all understand that AML/KYC companies store your personal ID on centralized servers which hackers love to target and it doesn't take rocket science to understand that centralized servers get hacked all the time and millions of records stolen, so why make it easy for hackers to get your ID and do ID fraud by allowing companies to keep it on a centralized server?
I've seen some awful scams these days as a result of stolen ID and data gathered by hackers/scammers from centralized companies (such as social media).  Example scams are:
1. Give us money or we will publish something inappropriate about you.
2. Give us money or we will hurt someone you love.
So the less hackers know about you, the safer you are.  How do you make it hard for hackers?  Stop storing personal ID/information on centralized servers?  How do you do that? avoid AML./KYC, social media etc as much as possible.
