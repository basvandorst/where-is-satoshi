From what I'm seeing on the charts, Bitcoin is still in an uptrend on the daily. I expected Bitcoin to bounce back in the coming days, but the recent announcement of the South Korean minister about regulating cryptos definitely caused a price drop, meaning that a bounce will probably take a little longer to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:00
Right there with you
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:26:24
Exactly how I am thinking right now. HODLing is tough on the mind though. Must persist.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:38:42
Don't get me wrong. I miss out on profits too of course, but I just take profits that I deem good enough for my situation. That way I do not waste time and money waiting for possible highs. FOMO is a real killer. Also, sometimes I make a bad buy, but in that case I simply HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:39
Holy shit. I just made 120 euros in a few minutes. Bless that dip!
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:10:06
I know, I should. Usually, I just tell them how much money I made and just see the envy in their eyes. Would be even better though if I could pay that ice cream with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:55
Right there with you buddy
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:54
I just bought at 11k and it turned around. Luckiest buy ever.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:19:44
I recently started daytrading Bitcoin and increased my investment by about 60% in 1.5 weeks, and I am not a professional. I consider myself to be an amateur who just reads about the market and the tools. I also think you have to have a strong mentality when daytrading.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:16:32
Why the hell would you directly sell to him? Are you not right in the head?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:28:56
I'm pretty sure that once all Bitcoins have been mined that the price will stabilize. At that point it can be fully accepted as a currency. The only problem is that people might sell off Bitcoin when it reaches an insanely high price and then simply move on to the next cryptocurrency to invest in. Either way, I don't really care. I am making money with Bitcoin. I'm increasing my wealth. In the end I'll be paying for my stuff with either FIAT, Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, but I will definitely have more money to spend.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:41:47
The 2013 one probably. Dropped over 80%.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:35
Ah the wonderful mind of people lacking long-term vision.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:44
Buy more and HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:33:16
Last correction was about 30%. Even after that correction BTC was overbought. Since then it rose to 19.5k, being even more overbought. Now we have a correction again, so obviously this one is bigger than the last one. Look at the daily charts. Every correction was followed by a bigger correction. It's only normal.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:47:50
What you're saying is partially true. Perhaps it is some kind of gold rush. Still, the people who actually got a decent portion of gold got rich. Obviously, the people who were with Bitcoin from the beginning are the real winners, but Bitcoin still has a long way to go. Bitcoin is nowhere near mainstream. It only got attention. It is currently in early adoption. There are actually not that many people in Bitcoin as you think. And most of the people that are, only have a small amount of bitcoin. As long as the demand for Bitcoin rises, the price will rise (especially because of its limited supply). It is simple economics. In the future Bitcoin might not seem like much since everybody will spend it like any other currency, but the few thousand or hundred thousand people who kept their Bitcoin all the way will have quite some money. My fear is more whether Bitcoin will actually be the cryptocurrency of the future or that maybe another cryptocurrency takes over.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:40:16
I know right. I'm just waiting for it to go to 15.000 euros...
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:11:48
Yes, true. I explained to many people that Bitcoin is in a short-term bubble and that a major correction is bound to happen, but that it will not mean the end of Bitcoin. It's just another obstacle to overcome towards mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:24
Tell me about it lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:46:49
It doesn't make much sense though. On the daily chart it is still overbought. Sure, we had a fairly big correction, but it lasted only a few hours. I think a correction spread out over a longer period is still to come before the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:37:16
Well, I never understood it either. I was just asking, because of the current dip. Also, around the holidays there is often low volume, so I doubt it will get to 20k by Christmas as it is only 5 days away. But ye, it will hit 20k, and 50k, and a 100k, and 1 million :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:13:35
I got in during the 2013 hype. Bought some BTC around the ATH, because I had quite some savings left which I wanted to partially invest. Few weeks later it crashed. I felt dumb, and I was dumb. Though I HODLed my Bitcoin since then, because I read more about it which convinced me that it has a future. Now I have way more than I initially invested. Also earning by day trading. The lesson I learned is to read as much as I can and have a strong mentality.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:11:58
I told them all that, but they usually just can't wrap their heads around it. Maybe I'm a bad explainer, but I think most people are just way too used to the status quo of banks and such. Regarding the money, I just tell them that I am well aware of the possibility of a price crash, but that I am not scared of it since I already got my initial investment out of it. Their envy is mostly that they are not in that position. A lot of people consider joining the Bitcoin bandwagon and I tell them to buy in, but people are either scared, stubborn or too lazy to read about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:07:02
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:23:26
Please tell me why some people are so happy about SegWit happening while other people are treating it like the end of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:31:46
That's my point. It is very uncertain what is going to happen. Since he is new to Bitcoin and wants to invest 10% of his monthly income it is better to just wait out the storm and buy in afterwards regardless of the price. Perhaps even buy BCH or another altcoin instead of BCC. Anyhow, it's a long term investment and I think we can all agree that cryptocurrencies are on the rise. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:43:05
You can buy Bitcoin at exchanges or third party companies who buy it for you on the exchange. If you wanna stash it then get a hardware wallet. Like those ledger thingies. Atm you probably wanna wait though with buying Bitcoin. There is quite some uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin. You can see it in the posts here. Better to wait after November or so.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:41:53
But is the split in November a certainty or just speculation?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:05:54
Exactly, it is likely another selloff is gonna happen now that the price has risen a bit. It always happened in the past. I'm pretty confident it could drop another 1000 dollars or so. Then you should really buy.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:24:31
Real dip still needs to happen
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:07:27
But that be your recovery phrase (like the 20 words or something) right? Like can you see your actual private key? (the 256 bit combination or something similar)
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:38:39
Buy the dip!
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:36:53
I'm just saying what is logical. Of course it could go down further, but I don't see reasons for it to drop down to a new lower low. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:51:10
That will lead to discrimination, inequality, and more expenses. People who are too poor will be rejected at schools and hospitals. People who are often ill will not get health insurance. People who have a car will have to pay immense fees to use roads since private companies want to make a profit. You can't leave everything to the market. There are countless of scientific papers that discuss and show the imperfections of markets. Some markets need government intervention. In fact, some services cannot be privatised.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:15:33
Aaaaaand it's gone :)
EDIT: No, wait. It's back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:21:18
Because taxation means regulation and adoption which also means more certainty. Whether you have income or wealth expressed in fiat or cryptos should not matter to taxation. As a citizen, you should pay tax. Simple as that. You really think crypto would stay untaxed?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:16:34
Warren and now Kennedy. They seem incredibly biased and reluctant towards cryptos which is just ignorant. At least the other committee members have an open mind about it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:12
Ok, so I read your article. You're saying taxation is theft because everyone is obliged to pay tax for services that they might not need or want. So let me ask you then. We as humans live in communities and benefit in general from public facilities like schools, hospitals, roads, dams, etc., but if taxation should not be there to pay for these public facilities then what should be there? What is your solution? 
Also, you conclude that the 'ruling class' enriches itself at the expense of the ruled through taxation and therefore tax should not be paid. This reeks of anarchism. I can tell you with absolute certainty that an anarchistic society or even a society without taxes will function worse than a society where the government collects taxes, if it even functions at all. Paying voluntary taxes only for the services you want is never going to work, because people will simply let others take the burden of paying. It's called the free rider dilemma. A simple matrix will show you that voluntary tax paying can only result in produced benefits equal (very unlikely) or lower (a lot more likely) than a system with obligatory tax paying.
How can the government tax your bitcoins? Well, just like any other income or wealth you have. Ofcourse, the difference is that they cannot easily see whether you own bitcoin or not, but that's similar to how the government cannot easily see whether you gained income from certain work. You are obliged by the law to tell the government how much you made with bitcoin and how much you have of bitcoin (in fiat that is). Of course, you can not do that and risk huge fines or even jail time. That's one of the reasons why the government doesn't want bitcoins to be anonymous. Even if they can't directly see how much bitcoin you have they can still look at your spending pattern. If you suddenly buy a Lambo, but you are a janitor then obviously something is off.
How can they print free bitcoins like fiat money to stay around? They can't nor should they.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:54:07
Well, despite how many times people are told that they should only invest money they can afford to lose, they still invest too much. So at some point they are forced to sell, because they need the money for something else. Also, some people are just forcing themselves by their own mindset. They are simply not willing to lose that much. They chicken out. Anyway, now is indeed the time to buy :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:19:27
And those are exactly the people who are selling now and spreading FUD. They are forced to take their losses and are pissed about it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:30:20
I'm talking about people who already sold and are pissed because they had to. And since they are pissed, they wish the same misfortune onto   others. That's just people being people you know.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:38:53
There is big institutional money waiting to rake in all the cheap coins now that they have shaken most of the weak hands out. If the institutions can spread FUD to make people sell like sheep, then they can and surely will pump up the price and create hype so the sheep will buy again. Of course, when exactly no one knows. We might go down to 6k first.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:13:25
So a 483 BTC sell order just got placed on Bitstamp...
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:09:20
I guess his kids convinced him at the dinner table. LOL.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:27:44
I like the positive atmosphere. They see the potential of cryptos and the future it has, and they want to crack down on market manipulation and scam ICO's. So far so good.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:09:58
Yes, 7k now. In the coming week we will go to 9k then pull back to 8k, then go back up and likely break out upwards. You can see the head and shoulders pattern forming. And even if that will not happen, Bitcoin is not forever staying at 7k. It will go up, so better buy now. See you in a few months ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:56:51
You have a very naïve and shallow view of the importance and workings of the government. Even though Bitcoin is meant to be a decentralized currency without government regulation it cannot be. Governments will always exist and so will have to regulate something like Bitcoin. I think you have the wrong idea of regulations. Regulations are not always bad. As I said, regulations create certainty. Regulations make sense and act as a guide/navigation tool in the wild west of cryptocurrencies. Take for example the fact that lots of governments want to regulate ICO's. That is a good thing because there are lots of ICO scams which give cryptos a bad image and hinders adoption. Once again, regulation will be good for adoption as the average Joe will then find it a lot easier to enter into the world of cryptos.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:37:25
Everyone has a limit of course. That doesn't take away the fact that Bitcoin still has technology that is worth something, because it is applicable in practice and it obviously still has a long way to go. If you really believe in the underlying tech then you should be fine with looking at red numbers in your portfolio. Sadly, most people are in it for the money. So yeah, you're right, let's see who still have the balls then. Fortune favours the bold.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:47:50
Stop talking bullshit. RSI was overbought on the 4h, we touched a resistance line and touched the 50d MA. A pullback is only normal. Looking at the daily RSI there is still a lot of room for growth. Also, the chart shows an almost perfect head-and-shoulder pattern back at the turnaround, indicating the price could go up to as much as $13k.
