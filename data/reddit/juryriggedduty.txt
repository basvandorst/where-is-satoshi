umm, yeah bitcoin and a few others dipped again, but 0x never dipped below the nov 24/25th bottom. it it only dipped a bit below. so that's a good stock to buy at the moment

apparent it's the same as buying low and selling high except more rapidly, and using borrowed money
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:26:13
one thing to note is that the peaks are super steep, and there's a drop and some oscillation and gradual decline. this pattern lets you know when you should sell. as in if the surge comes, wait until it rounds the corner, drops off, and then recovers. that's the safest sell point

the irony of your "correction" being itself incorrect.
guide is used as a verb there. a scout can guide someone, anyone can guide someone. that doesn't make him a guide. being that they are venturing into unknown enemy territory, he couldn't possibly be a guide. that would imply he has some kind of knowledge or system in place for traveling the area. he didn't. and he had no diplomatic pass through indian territory either. he wasn't a guide, he was a scout. it's two distinct job types. you are wrong. owned and son'd
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:11:54
yes the presence of bitcoin in the collective mind and its hold on the most fundamental technology means it's not going to just die. it'll take a true successor of which there are none at the moment to surpass it and make it irrelevant. until that time comes, expect bitcoin to keep ebbing and flowing. buy low sell high.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:37:03
i told peple to buy the dip at nov 24/25th the people who replied to my threads scoffed at my financial advise and said that's what people said when bitcoin was at 19k. however when it was at 19k it did not show a distinctive rebound arc like i illustrated with the red circle where it rose 30 degrees for over 6 hours, then climbed to 45 degrees within a 24 hour period without any subsequent downward trend. this indicates an upward trend. the blue  circle is where we are at right now, the general trend it upward. it has not and will not go below where the red mark i provided was. this is your last chance to buy low before it moons

morality and education will never trump biology, they can only temper and moderate it or channel its energy in various nondestructive ways. but it is the biological imperative that underlies all actions and behavior be they self centered or altruistic. the rationalizing of these actions as moral, logical, rational, and otherwise good or bad come after the fact once the powerful cortex has determined the best course of action subconsciously. the neo cortex copes with the actions subsequently.

the problem of the banking system is that its arbitrary. the winners and losers are not naturally derived. however with bitcoin, the w/l are determined by spending habits and things controlled within personal responsibility. i'm not saying they're the same, but that they will still have symmetric w/l ratios that are replicated elsewhere in reality and other physical and biological mechanics

those are specific types of coins catering to specific services. bitcoin will be the main leader of the crypto market, but bat has its uses and functions. in the future, exchanging between these coins will be seamless and dependong on what you purchase, your wallet will determine the best coin to use, and it will either help convert or use existing types of crypto for certain services.
therefore bat and 0x has their uses. so why be prejudiced against them. and why can't they become a 20k per coin market like bitcoin once bitcoin has climbed to 1million?
