Thanks. We plan to accept Bitcoin for concerts as well. Since there isn't a huge market for digital downloads through websites, are there any other  channels you think Bitcoin could prove useful for?

Very interesting-- thanks for digging into this. Seems like there are great possibilities at the intersection of BTC and streaming music sites, such as SoundCloud. One existing question is whether this should be a "Pay-What-You-Want" model, or if there should be a set BTC rate per/stream. It seems the existing BTC enthusiasts are willing to make meaningful contributions to artists, which perhaps makes the pay what you want model more attractive. 
Anyone have any perspective on that? Perhaps some combination of both would be effective.

I think you're on to something. Negative (otherwise known as reverse) payments could be one thing that gets people paying for music again.

Very cool. Scale is everything. Emailed you, but hopefully more people on here will contribute their thoughts on BTC/Music.

Very cool... checked out the page (love the tracks... funky and rhythmic). Curious how results have been w/ Pay what you want, specifically in Soundcloud.... has your "Donate" tab on Soundcloud been successful in reaching both the SC and BTC communities? Thanks for your feedback. Music for Bitcoin indeed!

Very cool Robness... just checked out the SC site. Nice tunes. Could not find the BTC tipjar on your souncloud page--- are you linking to it there? Curious... where have you found the most effective locations to place a tipjar link?

Can you post a link to your music page? Would love to see how you implemented bitcoin sales.

Haha, probably true.  On a positive note... If there's enough momentum behind BTC, then we'll start to see some of the goliath sites like SC start integrating these features. 
In the meantime, we can really make some small-scale headway just by experimenting with BTC's possibilities as the currency of the music industry. Last week we launched a digital btc store for one of our artists and are starting to see a little traction. Still a long, long way to go. But now it's just a matter of refining the platform towards the needs and wants of btc music lovers.

Yes, yes. With some sort of personal music "locker" that could include any future live recordings, collaborations, remixes related to that song. I think blockchain could solve the anonymity issue, not requiring people to login to hear their music.
