hi there, thnx for the guide.
i got a small problem setting up the lightning wallet:
i created the wallet with "lncli create" but when i try to unlock it with "lncli unlock" i am asked to enter my wallet passwort, after that i get the following msg:
"[lncli] Wallet is encrypted. Please unlock using 'lncli unlock', or set passwordfirst time starting lnd."
log file via sudo journalctl -f -u lnd:

a restart fixed it for me. i ran into some other problems now but trying to work them out.
made my first testnet payment on y'alls, amazing :)
cant get starblock to work though and cant see my public ip on 
so my location is totally messed up.

did you find a solution for this?
all my channels are also "active:false"
and "lncli listpeers" shows no peers

thnx for the quick answer.
a restart fixed it for me, i got 4 active channels now and some peers.

hi there, thnx again for the guide, everything is working now except i tried to install the welcome script (bonus section) and its not working correctly:
the script always shows my bitcoinnode as "not public".
when i check the state of my node on bitnodes, it says that its reachable and up.
When i execute the curl command from the script i get the following return:
curl -s  | jq .success
i read about the api on bitnodes (
NODE STATUS
Get status for an activated node. New node must be activated separately, i.e. from  before it can be accessed from this endpoint.
GET 
Status string in the response indicates the status of this node as of the last snapshot. Possible values for status are:
PENDING - The node has just been activated pending availability of a new snapshot.
UP - The node is currently reachable.
DOWN - The node is currently unreachable.
and when i use this command:
curl -s  | jq .status
--&gt; "UP"
so i tried to change the script from:
public_check=$(curl -s  | jq .success)
if [ $public_check = "true" ]; then
  public="Yes"
  public_color="${color_green}"
  public="Not reachable"
  public_color="${color_red}"
public_check=$(curl -s  | jq .status)  (i tried "${public_ip}" instead of "[MYIP] / [me]" too)
if [ $public_check = "UP" ]; then
  public="Yes"
  public_color="${color_green}"
  public="Not reachable"
  public_color="${color_red}"
both ${public_ip} and ${public_port} are correctly recognized and displayed under the entry "public" when running the script.
Can anyone help me what i am doing wrong, i am kinda new to all this stuff :)
THnx in advance.
