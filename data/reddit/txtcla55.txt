TIL unrelated == fraud. Wat?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:57:23
You did. Canada has this fun thing called "FINTRAC". Basically, any transaction over $10k is reported to the government. So when you decided to pull over that and put it into your bank you were essentially asking for it. 
  
So now you wait and if the government thinks you're clear and you have nothing to hide then you're fine... if not, well... that sucks.
  
Pro Tip: Sell for cash, in person, over time. No FINTRAC and you can be a proud hodler for longer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:00:31
I'll assume you're Canadian. Any transactions involving money over $10,000 will be reported and likely investigated due to FINTRAC laws. Basically, money laundering and terrorist activity. Not saying you are, but that is the way it goes.
  
So if you tried to move that money or recently traded that amount, that's likely what's going on.

I don't see much point in Lighting. I mean yes it's cool, but would I open a 100 day channel via a main chain transaction that can only transmit a predefined value of BTC and then have to close it with another transaction? Nope. At least that was the information I have about it last I checked a month or so ago.
  
Cool solution, but overengineered and I honestly don't think it'll get much traction if my info is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:41:39
Calling It beta while bitcoin is over 9 years old is ridiculous. If this is still a beta project it has piss poor development.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:00
They're talking about the transaction fee to send to Coinbase. Banks charge fees to move money to other accounts, then there's the trading fee, followed by the network fee when the user moves their BTC to a wallet they control.

Person still lost money trying to buy bitcoin with their own money, there are other exchanges that do charge a fee, and they will lose money via fees if they move their coins from the exchange (which you SHOULD always do). If you're going to dispute my comment at least make an effort.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:55:54
Lightning channels cost around a dollar to open and close. Your math is already off. You can only transact (AFAIK) the amount you set up the channel for, so if it's 20bits then only 20bits can be transacted before the channel closes. [Sauce, if interested]( I can't see anyone opening a daily channel for their expenses for $2 a day, especially if they have a credit card or free debit transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:40:57
Testnet =\= mainnet
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:34:24
Thats not the point I was driving at. The point was that it still costs the user money to open a channel, the channel can only transmit a certain amount so at some point they'll need to re-open a new one. And on top of that channels are only open for 100 days (last I heard). 
  
As I said down below... if you have a credit card or unlimited debt, which most of the world does, this doesn't make economical sense. You're spending BTC to send a set amount of BTC which while it may be faster, you can do the same thing with any other payment provider, and for less. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Greece had problems going into the agreement, and now Euro Zone members are realizing the country is essentially a lost cause. I'm betting they'll drop out and the Euro makes a rebound, but the EZ is far too beneficial for other members to call it quits just yet.

Canada does this already. We treat it like a barter transaction and thus each time we transact we should be keeping track of the price of Bitcoin, the amount transacted, and the tax (13%) that could be charged.
  
I know what you're thinking "how do they find you?" thats exactly where the system falls apart. Either way, the Canadian Government only wants the tax amount when you use over 10-11K in a 12 month period...so unless your ballin' the exchanges or a Bitcoin merchant you're pretty safe.

@_date: 2014-12-05 23:18:27
Should add on that if you make one ledger say you own 100 bitcoins, the network will respond with their copies and prove that you're lying. AND you cant force the network to accept this new ledger unless you have enough computational power to override them and fork them over to your ledger. At the end of the day, not only is it theoretically impossible its also just flat out highly unlikely.

Basically its this little $50 router you flash with a custom version of OpenWRT that makes a hotspot to swap files without the need of an actual internet connection. The box wipes when powered off and keeps no user info other than the files on the USB drive.
  
What about doing something like that only having a soft bitcoin paywall (and or 30 minutes free access) that would allow users to hop on to the actual internet via the ethernet port?

. . . PC Financial, Tangerine, and to an extent other banks offer accounts with no fee banking; especially for youth and students. So provided they have access to the internet or live near a city like the majority of Canadians, it's not an issue.
  


  
You don't save money, the only reason you should have a fat savings account is if you're new to the country or you've yet to set up a proper investment vehicle. Investing is the best way to keep that cash safe from the taxman and more fees. Just setting up a TSFA or RRSP is a huge plus, which by the way, have no fees, no tax, and you can open up more than one at multiple banks. 
  


  
Did I miss the "Make Canada Great Again" parade? Never heard anyone say this.
  


  
  


those are the people who won't profit as much from bitcoin, i highly doubt they will ever understand bitcoin as us, those are the people that that bank can easily exploit,
  
Again... Wow. You're really riding the high horse aren't ya bud. And didn't you say earlier there are online options? It's almost as if most folks do that than say walk into a bank. 
  
You talk as if you care for the poor folks who use banks, then you slander them for being too stupid to understand bitcoin and how ultimately it'll be your profit. That's not very Satoshi of you.
  
The banks in Canada suck, I'm not denying that. But they are better than most and if you play the system you'd be surprised how many loopholes there are. There's a reason why Canada is listed alongside other tax havens.

lol $2 monthly service fee? Thats cute. Only 2 ATM transactions allowed, each will cost you $2.50 (domestic) or $3.50 (international). Already that's a good $7 or $9 in fees for simply accessing your money. OK...
  
On the plus side, online transactions are unlimited... up to a monthly limit of $2.5k or $20k depending on verification. So, thats something. But really if you're just sending BTC, just send it with a regular client, sure you can use it IRL, but with those fees and limits I'd drop it after the first transaction.

Hey, guess what, Tangerine is owned by Scotia Bank,
Hey, guess what, Bitcoin doesn't care whether you or not you are a student or youth, bitcoin is open to everyone
Hey guess what, ever tried opening a bank account as a youth or student? can't open one unless you submit identification,
  
So its owned by a bank?... And? PC Financial is owned by CIBC... They diversified thier service, welcome to the free market. Guess what, it doesn't bother me. Open to everyone? Even if I don't have internet? Wow what a feat, it must be just like cash then!


  
I'm brainwashed? You sound like you just drank a litre of kool aid dude. I save via investing, interest rates suck when you just leave your cash in a bank and grow it by working and or other "favors". Do it right and your wealth grows. My parents raised me to keep a level head about finances... dumping my savings into a volatile internet "dollary doo" isn't a wise course of action long term.
  
As for your hilarious TSFA rant, I don't expect you to know to know much about them given your obvious bias.

LOL, seriously are you a Loony Toon reject?
  
Why is Canada a tax haven? Look up LLC's and what happens if you're not a Canadian citizen who owns one.

That's how banks work bro. Its worked for a long time and if you think some magical internet money is going to dethrone it you've really fallen off the deep end. I used to think like you, then I started talking to people out in the real world who never used bitcoin... guess what, they don't care. Well thats not true, they care when I tell them about how they can buy drugs online and maybe a LED fleshlight. 
  
Feel free to suff your tear stained mattress with dollars. I hope you have good fire prevention and some damn good home security... Ah wait you put it all in bitcoin didn't you! Clever man, gee whiz I wish I had that kind of financial sense, all my money wrapped up in volatility... ahh well, a man can dream. 
  


  
You know what, that's the only thing I can agree with you on... Start doing some research. Great advice!

Ah yes you do. If you're not using a third party like bitpay you're paying them in "raw" bitcoin and the only way you can do that is if they, the merchant, accepts "raw" bitcoin which you'll quickly find out is few and far between. Most use bitpay because it automatically cashes out the bitcoin to their preferred currency (USD, etc.) and pays them in that.

Well they're familiar with distributed ledgers which are nothing new, they fear the decentralized part as up until 2009 they had full control who writes in their ledger.

@_date: 2017-09-07 14:48:05
Ah, but the rest would be subject to capital gains which is half of the final value and then whatever your tax rate is. 
  
So if you did put in $5k, and bitcoin hit $50k. Subtract the $5k tax free portion, leaves $45k and capital gains is only taxed on $22.5k of that (half of $45k). Which at the lowest tax bracket, is only $5k in taxes. You still effectively take home a sweet $45k (add back in that $5k tax free), which aint bad. 
  
Heck, you could even go a step further and toss that $45k into an RRSP and get another tax write off for next year.

While I was away in Amsterdam and Berlin this was my backup plan. Getting emergency cash or just a few extra bills was an issue because the banks and mastercard really fine the hell out of transactions like that. So I had a bitcoin wallet with a few extra hundred or so which if needed I'd swing by a BTM somewhere. Thankfully I never needed the money, but it was a comforting plan B.

He dropped almost $200 on them and keeps them locked away and out of view. He's not even using the addresses paired with them. Waste. Of. Money. 
  
This 99 cent trinket however, I can flaunt it around like a big shot^/s and if it ever gets lost or stolen I'll just drop another 99 cents. As for the actual bitcoin(s) I can just slip a paper wallet into the plastic case. Done.

Development in crypto is a good thing, weather or not Ethereum turns out to be smoke and mirrors is yet to be seen, but by the same token we don't know what the final product is. 
  
I really agree with u/throwawash, people in this community can be downright angry and ignorant when it comes to anything thats not Bitcoin. Keep an open mind and you'll find other things just as interesting.

Reminds me of when the internet was young and Microsoft wanted everyone to use their own version of TCP (The name of which escapes me). They spend a lot of money on development and in the end dropped the project as everyone started using the TCP protocol.
  
I bet IBM will suffer the same way. All the R&amp;D will mean nothing and in the end they'll abandon the project.

"Registered Mail" There's your problem. I've bought stuff from all over and whenever I use the registered mail (no tracking, base shipping) it can take anywhere from 15 days to at most a month before it arrives on your doorstep. I'd wait a little longer, but keep trying to get through to their customer service.

From what I understand, Bitcoins/cryptocurrency tokens cannot exist without the blockchain as without a token of value the work to build and complete transactions on the blockchain lacks incentive for miners to spend energy on doing said task. 
  
So when a bank/company says they love the idea of a blockchain they're really showing how little they know about the system as you cannot have one without the other. A token to give the chain value and a chain to record the tokens use.

I have agree with viscousflow. I got started in cryptocurrency because of Dogecoin. It was a simple coin you could toss around willy nilly and it helped me understand the tech behind bitcoin. I no long use Dogecoin as I slowly learned more about the technology and migrated to bitcoin as it was the leader that started it all. 
  
Yes, Dogecoin is a joke, but it was far more forgiving to lose 1 Dogecoin than a whole bitcoin. Plus its friendly community openly welcomes new users, something I can't say bitcoin has really excelled at.

You didn't address the issue though. Coins will be lost. We can always find more gold, not just on earth but in space (should we ever get out there). The reality is one is still more available than the other.

Only credit cards and some debit payments. Which makes sense as with credit cards you're buying things with the banks money. The article has no source, so chop it up to poorly written and misleading.

There's posts, blogs, and articles everywhere on how to keep your coins safe. I know it sounds cold, but if they couldn't be bothered to do their due diligence, they never really owned those coins to begin with.

 As a country bumkin once said "stupid is as stupid does". The thing is there were so many red flags from GAW, but people got greedy and ignored the signs. While I hope Garza gets what's been long overdue I hope this doesn't deter people from Bitcoin, but helps them learn more about being a savvy online consumer.

ORLY? /s
  
Yeah, but which is easier to enter? 1000 doge equal to one cent or 0.0000XXXX of the same value? Theres again also the sense of value, to me any decimal of bitcoin is still more valuable than its equal amount of doge. Really when it comes down to it all I'm saying is that if bitcoin is internet gold, dogecoin is like internet pyrite.

You are not required to run a node, it's voluntary. If you're unable to it's fine, no one is going to judge you.
  
That being said, as time goes on bandwidth limits are increased and unlimited bandwidth is becoming more affordable (I have it and I live in Canada).
  
So yeah it is trivial, possibly a slippery slope if there is massive demand, but if bitcoins history of updates has proven anything; it'll be a long time before sweeping changes are made on a dime (current projected fork excluded of course).

Agreed. From a UI/UX perspective this is clunky. Yes, it gets easier after the first two clicks, but a lot of UI/UX designers live by the rule "one click is one too many" and this certainly violates that.

BIP38 printed offline, one copy stored in watch (very small QR, but works), one copy safe in secret location, another copy on a USB drive. I don't keep all my coins in one spot of course, but generally there's three ways I back them up.

The piece of paper is double sided with the BIP38 encrypted key on the other side. Its also laminated so it shouldn't fade over time. I was thinking about making multiple keys each hidden in one of my many watches, but I figured I should try out a simple one first.
