this is fake news. i don't see BTC payments on their site. Plus there is no source if you read the article. Shame on you as a community

Find the error in this reddit headline: "we should familiarize ourselves with LN..."
When was the last time you read the google or YouTube instruction manual before using it? And how many people do you think will EVER do that?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:11:49
This instruction manual graphic states LN hubs are centralized. And you are making my point: Merchants already have PayPal + CreditCards for this. Why would they invest more for an even more complex (for them and their customers) centralized payment option?
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:19:01
The companies running those nodes can block my account for any reason. How is that structure not centralized?
I know I have the alternative of opening a new payment channel and pay the transaction fee of 20$ or more... which I have to do to even start with LN either way
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:42:42
I don't have to trust them. If implemented properly they can't steal my coins. And yet they can block me and thus stripping me off all my payment options and forcing me to spend more 20$ transaction fees to open new channels.
Doesn't sound like I am in control anymore with BTC legacy - not as we used to be in Satoshis whitepaper.

Did you read the CoinDesk article? They also cite "an unnamed person" as their source.
Just check for yourself to see it's fake news

Which would mean in case of a dispute all your received payments of the last months/year could be reversed since they are not finalized on the blockchain. Your scenario gets more horrible with every comment :(
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:58:44
Agreed. Just like Picasso paintings xD
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:44:47
OK thx for clarifying. So if I got my signed transactions via LN I can always prove that I got the money. Even if all major LN hubs suddenly refuse to business with me (for example because I am in the wrong country).
And how about double spending? It can't happen since channels are only between 2 nodes with collateral locked on the blockchain.
I still don't see this as the scaling solution. What will be the business model of those big banking LN hubs? They will sell my data and/or charge fees from me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:17:57
Currently, to use LN with TORGuard, you have to read an instructions manual, contact support and copy &amp; paste JSON around to make payment.
I will gladly wait how this improves in the next few years and where other coins are until then.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:01:11
You are misinformed. BitCoin legacy already sacrificed their security when they separated transactions from signatures (Segwit). To do this they bent their code over backwards and put the signature part  where unspent transaction output belonged. Now miners could even reverse BTC transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:35:38
If BTC legacy users increase then transaction fees will surely increase too. Plus you are forgetting that you will need to pay the transaction fee every time refill your channel balance.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:23:52
"massively connected central hubs" how does that fit in with decentralized payments?
What's gonna be the business model of those hubs? They will be the new credit card companies - so you gave all your benefits of the original Satoshi BTC away.
Why would merchants ever go for that solution? When they can implement another coin TODAY with lower fees and without any major changes (which require investing more money) ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:07:04
sure. better than my shiny gold which i can access any time without paying fees lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:49:41
I think his scenario of the miners abandoning BTC legacy is quite realistic. They wanted bigger blocks in the first place - and now they got it in a functioning network that's getting more adoption every day
This would make BTC legacy transaction go from "slow &amp; expensive" to "impossible".
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:07:41
BCH, DASH and more have solved their scalability issues

Seeing this I realize BitCoin is dead!!! Instead of innovation, adoption and more features u guys actually spend time on a worthless fork that has 0 roadmap and isn't even traded on any major exchange��
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:22:43
dream on
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:02:39
Where is the ban proof?
But besides from that, I just love all the wining here everytime BTC drops. Don't you know you can short BTC too, for example with Futures....?
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:24:48
what attack exactly can we see on this screenshot?
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:51:14
Since when is there a patent on bitcoin? Isn’t it a free market where the better product wins?��
