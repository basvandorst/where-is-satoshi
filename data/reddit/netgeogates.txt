Could someone spare me/us? the unintersting faulty predictions and tell me who predicted the current price correctly, if there was a correct prediction to begin with?

No one besides us understands what bitcoin is anyway.

I don't get this "limited in supply" stuff. If there is the last BTC mined wont the price just adjust to the level of the satoshi's? I mean you can always devide 1 BTC in smaller and smaller parts right? You could even tokenize this into infinity in smaller segments = no real limited supply like gold? Sure you could tokenize gold also but it's tokens still has to be reflected in a real physical asset. (Dont downvote its a real question not an opinion).

Hmm the chart just proves that the quote is wrong because the 35 year age group is the second biggest one.

Question. Is BTC really finite? Lets say the last bitcoin is mined, couldn't they tokenise a satoshi into multiple parts? Like they are tokenisin artwork and stuff?
