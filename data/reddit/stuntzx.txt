You see its 21 mil whole coins but you can have a satoshi as its smallest transaction unit so its more like 21 trillion    so in reality with 7 billion people in the world we in theory could only have each person have 3,000 satoshi

Made me laugh well played
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:01:37
Yeah i figured was on phone trying to look ot up.  I saw it was 1 mil ber bitcoin.  Its 100mil?   2,100,000,000,000,000     which is better i thought 3,000 seemed low.

Give me Bitcoin so I can mine Bitcoin for you so you can finally get in on the Bitcoin action and have your own Bitcoin

However, acquaintances of Niemiro say they suspect foul play.  
Uh, Yes bullet to the head will make people wonder.

300,000 per person still seems small. in 5-10 years we will have 8-9 billion so assuming btc is fully adopted that leaves less.  Say a burger is at its lowest cost at 1 sat then how can you compare say a house to a burger at 300k sats ?

No shit one exists right now and one is in the works and isn't even implemented yet.   Trusting Libra is the same as trusting any announcement of a new coin

Having batteries that store excess energy during the day will run a few extra hours at night. The point being that no money is spent on energy to run them and its 100% profit after initial costs.

People need to understand any concept that can track a digital thing while also guaranteeing there is only one and can never be duplicated and can not be transferred with out a data trail is amazing.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:27:00
WHY? i mean if you are at 997 why not just 1000 didnt want to spend that Much? I guess if you already had 3 it makes sense.
@_date: 2018-05-04 10:50:34
Yeah that's true and sad.  Most people don't even realize it. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:25:43
I disagree with all this BS  some politician scamming to pass this.   Bitcoin is public domain. Shady shit right here.   Classis trademark scams.  You cant trademark something that has been aroind for 10 years and say its yours now. F them

Its possible, i just got up had a thought and put it on reddit.  Will look into it more when i get to office
@_date: 2018-05-04 11:36:03
i get what your saying but for it to be used globally a lot more people would need to have it to work. If only 20 million people own it on a planet of 7 billion hard to make it work as a currency.
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:42:53
Uh that is a perfect example of someone getting old and not realizing what NOT to say sometimes. It maybe true but hey don't tell people you can pay your debt just by printing money.  I feel like that is something Trump would say today.

what if he did that with 5 different account or 20 and just to see what was right and then push that one out there.   i know the game is rigged by algos at this point

not so a lot of people have way to much time on there hands.  Or just make a bot that made the accounts.  It is just odd that they just started making predictions this week.  Why nothing else.  Just a flag in my head.

As much as i think the idea of bitcoin is good. The amount of scams and tricks off the bat are hard to sell.

yes,  My statement is more towards Solar in general.  If you buy some panels and run your rig during the day there is 0 cost for electricity.
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:43:03
Yes but thats the point  90% of the population is uninformed. So the bitcoin movement is already dominated by people that know more than 90% of the world. They are ready for  uninformed people
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:10:50
After its creation it is. So to the end user it is free after the purchase of the solar panel. Why are you digging so deep in a very general statement.
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:38:52
Well that is how it will be since the worlds energy is still mostly fossil fuel so things that are made will still use that energy.   If you had a solar factory plant powered by 100% solar panels  then all the panels that come out of that factory were with free energy.  
but then you could say the materials that went into the factory were not made from renewable.  
yes this is the case but we need to start somewhere and once things start being switched over to renewable there will be less and less of the fossil fuels being used to make things.  Its just how it is right now.  Sooner or later things will change.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:10:07
oh lordy.      My original statement is if i had solar panels running a bitcoin miner during the day the cost to run it is zero. 
That was it. My only statement and is 100% accurate
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:14:41
Yes because its the cheapest way.   Think free money if only running during the day on solar  no electricity at all.

Aren't taxes socialism then by your standard.   If you are basing Venezuela as your beacon of what socialism is then you are way off. 
Why not just call Venezuela what it is a corrupted country with its corrupt leaders.
Why not choose Denmark or Finland or countries that are running very well under that system.    
The Fact is no matter what system a country has if the leaders are corrupt then the system will fail the people.
Looking at America if we didn't get Taxed to spend 800 billion on war and instead just used that to lets say 200billion on military and 600 billion on infrastructure/healthcare/education we would still be spending more on Military and have better systems for the people.  We are being taxed for things that do not help the people.   
So merely asking to be taxed and have that money go to our own country people is not much to ask. Not to line the pockets of military companies that need to keep finding reasons to keep people scared so they can keep making weapons to keep making a profit. 
Just imagine the kind of people we would have if everyone had healthcare and good education. Smarter Healthier people will never be a bad thing. 
No system is perfect but if a country has good leaders then they would do right by their people. Not all leaders are good. bad Leaders can take any system and corrupt it.

It does show you that if fiat does collapse there is an alternate and your country is not 100% screwed. It seems they had no choice but to use bitcoin in many cases in a way saving the countries economy so it can at least function to a degree.
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:19:17
Uh yeah we all pay its called taxes.  I have great healthcare i need nothing.  But my point is everyone cool with having us taxed 800 billion for warmachine but cry if taxes go to basic healthcare or education for its own citizen.   Government money going to contracts for military is cool  but back into healthcare or educations for its own citizens is uncool
Don't fake quote me with that stupid crap.
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:24:17
So great america  and there checks and balances working out great right now i guess.  Its pretty obvious there are people at all levels of the government that are using it for their own gain.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:14:28
My guess is most of that is people holding and the other is people that either lost all together or just forgot about it and have no access not thinking it would be anything and didnt care

No much better ways to mine.   1 gpu mining something on nicehash for a year will net more then that.  A 1080  iil get about .0002 a day  it may go down but still 700 gpu will get at least .05to.07    but in a year you still have the gpu which you can sell for at least 50%.    That is a easy way. You can always setup to mine the most profitable coin yourself and hold.   Difficulty will go up but at the end of the day you still have the gpu. So its like having a computer mine for you but you will always have a pc even if prices go to zero. Imagine renting your car or something you can still use it when ever you want it just earns money when not in use

To many bitcoins are gone never to be seen again.  
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:12:37
True it all goes down to how far the smallest part can be recorded. being at (0.00000001 BTC)  right now.     So total amount of "units"  is  2,100,000,000,000,000   satoshis     is this something that they have talked about for the black chain to be able to record in smaller than those units? 
Because i see this as if lets say over time they ALL were lost. Liquidity say after 200 years and people die lose keys as to be expected the total number will dwindle but seems like if they can move the decimal at any time to create ten times more. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:15:53
It means that there is way to many bitcoins lost to time and will never be seen again.  Another coin will need to be the flagship going forward. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:05:37
I would imagine so. I do not know 100%.  But the secure nature of this makes sense   nothing is created its all secured. Think how many lost their coins 5 years ago or people today thay lost their keys. Or people that bought some and forgot about it.  Bitcoin is just like cash it is held with a very few.  I have a small amount and i forgot how to get to it.  Multiply that by 1000 and well ist mostly gone forever.  I 100% believe in crypto  its just that bitcoin has faded away. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:58:46
That is what i gather considering how far out the decimals go being a satoshi is at 0.00000001 BTC     to me the smallest amount is really what the whole bitcoin should be.  No reason to have parts of a bitcoin
