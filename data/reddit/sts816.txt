And that's the problem.

The only thing driving up the price of bitcoin right now is speculation. If people roll over and accept that it'll never be a useful currency, then it'll collapse. The only thing even keeping it this high right now is everyone's belief that it'll eventually go up higher.

Is that site down?

Ah my bad then. I've seen some people beating themselves up over it. I felt a twinge of anger and regret when I was thinking about buying just 6 months ago but never did.

My point was that you had no way of knowing what was going to happen. It's pointless to blame yourself for things you only realized were mistakes  after looking back on them in hindsight.

Playing devil's advocate, I don't think it's fair to call them stupid if they aren't familiar with or don't understand something as...different as cryptocurrencies. I'd wager that the vast majority of people did not understand Bitcoin is or how the block chain works the first time they were introduced to them. Even then, understanding the technical nuances of Bitcoin is completely different than understanding the ramifications of Bitcoin.

You should treat the money as gone the second it leaves your bank account. Treat it as an irreversible expense.

I love seeing average people become super rich with cryptos. I think the process of becoming very wealthy by "traditional" means (starting companies, selling companies, inherited wealth, etc) fundamentally change a person. It's very interesting to see the average Joe skip that process entirely.

You were probably thinking you got a sweet deal and suckered some guy into accepting your worthless magic internet money.

I realize there's no guarantees but I still thought the idea might be cool.
