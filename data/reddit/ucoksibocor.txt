I'm from Indonesia. We have several other bitcoin exchanges in Indonesia. Among them: artabit.com and tuker.in.
These exchanges website and their business operation are still under development. Actually currently, they are not operating as exchanges yet, where people can put bid and offer price of bitcoin. But rather, these websites sets their sell and buy price, and people can sell bitcoin to them or buy from them. This is because the number of bitcoin owners in Indonesia is still relatively small, so a proper exchange does not seem to be feasible yet.
Many bitcoin enthusiasts also trade bitcoin OTC or through localbitcoins.com.
Not so many merchant are accepting bitcoin at the moment, but I believe that bitcoin will be growing fast in Indonesia (provided that the government does not make silly assessment and regulation about bitcoin later).

It does not :). The government is planning to do re-denomination on the currency though. Maybe within the next 5 years. The new rupiah will be equal to 1000 old rupiah.
