It's a metaphor, friend.  Of course they don't literally rot, but there is always that chance that their value deteriorates to a point that they may as well have.  Or, you know, some crazy Carrington Event occurs and fries all the electronics.
I just hate that saying, is all.

Well, if I invested in apples and they all rot, I still lost.  Not selling half the produce before it turns would be better than losing the whole bushel.
Point being, I like your spirit, but half the optimism and double down on the realism.

I worked at a local telecom company, and apparently they only part of your password that matters is the first 8 characters.  I once had someone complain that their old password and new password were working.  Something like Harvard12 and Harvard13 were both working...
I wasn't allowed to tell them why, so I changed it to something totally different...  I don't work there, anymore.

Go to Central America.  You can get it done pretty cheap my qualified doctors who go there for the lower cost of living.

A what now?
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:40:49
I just put in $10/week and then check on it now and again.  Still don't have a full bitcoin, yet...  but eh.

A lot of people don't realize just how different many areas of the country are, culturally.  Trying to pass sweeping legislation to morally govern so many different folks is a fool's errand.  Let the smaller state and local governments decide how they want to handle those kinds of issues.

I've just been refusing to update every time it asks.  Been working okay for me...  Still fucking annoying, though.  I might try something new.

There is a bit of a market cornering occuring with aluminum and JP Morgan, I believe.

Well, you can't really spend gold, but it has value.

I like to look at it being that there is an excess of wealth in the hands of people who are unaccustomed to it, and they are actually decent people.  As such, they are spreading it around a bit.

Yeah, I figured my best way into the system was to mine some LTC and transfer them through that way.  Managed to adjust my Nvidia 560 Ti to get about 140 kh/s...  so, we'll see how it plays out.

People should use bitcoin so that the bitcoin he has hoarded away will go up in value.   It makes sense.

I can't believe no country is giving Gavrilo Princip political asylum!

For such an anonymous currency, I have sure put my information in a lot of sites these past days...
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:31:41
I feel like I just pissed someone off.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:26:22
Well, considering most sites require wire transfers and such to get USD into them, it may take a week.  Might have already happened.

I feel like not buying into them to begin with probably gives me a much better feeling than if I HAD bought into them and sold them when they hit $20...
So, I guess there's that.

...Shit, these things are slowly becoming as complicated at the rest of finances.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:01:11
Probably because I am sitting here in my quiet studio listening to a drippy faucet with a toothache and about $40 to my name thinking, "I fucked up."
But you're right.  I can't sit here mentally masturbating about what could've been, trying to will myself into that reality.  All I can do is kick myself in the ass for missing out on a second investment opportunity because I was too lax on the risk-taking to pull the trigger.

I think the best way to make it viable would be to stop trading in full bitcoins and begin trading in a denomination of it.  People are stupid and don't feel like dealing with decimals.  If you start setting the decimal of a bitcoin to 1 and drop the price, I feel like there would be a spike.  Currently it is very intimidating to get into it.

Difference being that the money could just be reprinted, but Bitcoins max at 21m.

I got some last night and watched them drop by 27% in value, so that's probably fueling this a bit.  It's was a bit obsessive last night, where I was up until the sun came up researching and relearning everything that I looked into two years ago.
