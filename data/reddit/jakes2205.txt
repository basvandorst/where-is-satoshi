I'm not regretting it.

Yes, Coinbase is a safe exchange. Just make sure you are visiting the actual Coinbase website and not some scammy alternative.

Ok, I'll admit, it was wrong to say all of that doesn't matter. Some it does, and could be indicative of larger movements. But it alone is indicative of nothing because of the larger complexity of these markets and projects. Just because money switches from one project to another means nothing because the majority of people are not in it to support the project but to get quick gains.
In my view, there are many good projects worthy of support that I am excited to see come to fruition. Whether they will fall obsolete to sidechains, that is yet to be determined, but I am excited to move forward regardless.

No. Yesterday was an anomaly, which is why it says we're down 10% in the last 24hrs. Today is a healthy continuation of the previous days' increase. 
When a correction does occur, expect anywhere from a 20%-50% correction, or even more up to 80% as we've seen in years past. Good luck, and have fun

Good time to diversify and get into alts while they're down :)

Well, most popular that I don't have a position in (so I'm not biased) being Ethereum

That's not how futures work... CBOE is not a bitcoin exchange, you cannot sell bitcoin directly to them. They offer future contracts, which is essentially a bet on whether you think bitcoin will be above/below a certain price in one/two/three/etc. months

I use a Ledger Nano S, but I've heard good things about Trezor

If you truly believe that then I feel sorry for you. There are some fantastic projects and technologies coming out through alts that have potential to revolutionize the world. Just because they don't have the recognition of bitcoin doesn't mean that they are "redundant and therefore dead."

You're safest having a hardware wallet, always, doesn't matter the amount. I personally have a small amount on exchanges for quick trading but the majority in a hardware wallet.

Sure, so if you're using Coinbase and using a bank account to purchase it will take approx. 8 days for the coin to show in your account. You cannot sell until it shows up in your account, so if the price crashes during this time Coinbase is your bro by giving you a forced HODL.
If you purchase with USD that is in your account then the coin is in your wallet almost instantly.
To sell a coin, just go to your accounts, specific wallet, and click sell. Once you sell, Coinbase will take a fee, and the USD amount will show up in your USD wallet. You can withdraw it from here or leave it in there to purchase more.
I recommend using GDAX as opposed to Coinbase. GDAX is owned by Coinbase but is like Coinbase's bigger brother. More professional interface, lesser fees, and more options. Give it a look, you can login using your Coinbase credentials. Overall both are easy to use, but I use GDAX to buy and then transfer to other exchanges for trading.

All of that means nothing. Just because multiple projects are doing similar things (albeit not the same) does not make them "dead," that simply inserts competition. Just because a new project is stealing share does not mean it is "dead," if anything it means it is doing it better. But remember, the majority of people are in this not for technology, but for investments/profits. So it makes sense that a new project can gain shares as projections rise because they are doing it not because of a project's success but of the price forecasts. Just because a project has backing does not mean shit, how many projects with billions in funding have failed? (hint: alot)
Down 80% relative to bitcoin? No shite. Almost all of them are down relative to bitcoin, that's how these markets work. It's not indicative of projects dying or anything similar, it's just people pulling their money looking for quick profits.
You don't honestly believe that alts are "redundant," "dead," and unworthy of supporting; do you?

I'll facilitate this bet. My fee is 1%

Yup. Sold mine around 19k. Refuse to buy back in until 13 or lower.

If it hits 20k by the end of the year I will eat a used sock... Sorry, I value my left nut too much
