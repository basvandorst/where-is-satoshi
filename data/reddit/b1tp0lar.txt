I bought a new cpu cooler with bitcoin because my shitty intel one broke when I was cleaning the heat sink. I had enough of my funds in a wallet on my phone so used that. Everything went well and when I received the cooler it felt even.... cooler than it would have if I bought with old time fiat lol
