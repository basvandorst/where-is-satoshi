That was the one that I was actually looking at.

Well the first link I wanted to get the community to invest into a cloud miner together and all of the Doge that gets mined goes to charity but I took it down after about 30 minutes because I saw that no one was interested. I don't know whats wrong with the second link to you because all that I was doing was looking to buy a mining contract and the third link I just sold my DCMU to someone. Also DCMU isn't a cloud miner and in the second link I was looking for someone to mine for me and I pay them, not for a cloud miner.

I don't really know. I just wanted to know which cloud miner could make me the best ROI. Thats all.

Well, no. Its a community investment where we all bought DCMU and the Doge that was received from us buying them was invested into cloud mining and then every Sunday we received a payout.

You gotta really calm down. You think that you can solve the problems to humanity but you can't. Have a good day :)

Yes they are investments and one of the investments that the Doge was invested into were cloud mining. I just bought into an investment. How am I a scam.

Alright. A guy replied "Whoever that person is didn't belong in the first place. Until I hear of a real US entity going after GAW for shady business practices then I don't care what they have to say. Show me someone with real authority: The IRS, SEC, etc... These talkers have no authority."
