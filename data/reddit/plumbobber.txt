there is a huge difference between the ability of a field reporter and news journalist.

There is a reason that $1 dollar is the standard and there are pennies , nickels, dimes, and quarters. 
Bitcoin needs to name denominations lower than 1.

So what's the answer? Google or Microsoft to make a secure, insured exchange?

How much do you have now? How much did you invest to get there? If you don't mind the question.

How do I go through the act of spending a bitcoin, ensuring it is done safely and know that I used the proper amount.
Let's use a simple transaction.
I want to buy a painting from an artist. I can buy it directly from that artist or I can buy it from an art store that accepts bitcoin. The painting costs $45.00 in bitcoin from either vendor.
Please outline both scenarios assuming I have bought some bitcoin and have a whacky numeric address on my coinbase account that has 5 bitcoins.

yah, I don't even know when mine will come. How does it work? Do you receive them at the time you made the order or when the order actually goes through your bank account?

What's the best way/place to buy now? 
p.s. I'm kicking myself so hard when I discovered it in 2010 and was going to drop $500 on a thumb drive and leave it in a shoebox for 10 years. I got too freaked out and didn't get the concept enough. Hindsight.

I'd be way more comfy wth my BTC in an exchange if one of the big boys, like Microsoft, had an exchange and wallet instead of these anonymous crooks like Mt Gox and others. One that let's you trade and spend with ease, even if it's all regulated and . Until then BTC won't get the respect it needs to make it in this world, because the whole ecosystems seems like a criminal empire filled with at best speculators and anarchists and at worst foreign mafias.

Can someone invent an app where I can buy bitcoin from coinbase without having to hand over my bank accounts and first born child after waiting 4 days?
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:33:40
seriously, have you tried to buy bitcoin as a newb? It's a fucking pain, you need to give bank info to companies you have no idea if you should trust, it takes days to get it confirmed so you don't even know what price you are buying it at.
It's messy, and an amazon or someone needs to make a purchasing, cashing, and wallet system that the masses will trust.

Well this just made me realize how overly complicated this BS currency is and how completely insecure. I'm dumping mine. Fuck it.
