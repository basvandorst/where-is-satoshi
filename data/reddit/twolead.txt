I disagree on going *100%* all in. Married, 34M, 2 kids. But thumbs up on the risk you're taking.
What follows here is what I think in terms of "purchasing power", as in, filling a grocery cart with the basics. The fed is continuing to print freely without restraint, and fiat is diluting. Hence everything stored at a bank is losing purchasing power. But there are a number of investments, besides BTC, that retain purchasing power in the face of fiat dilution:
1. Stock: I predict that stocks will actually continue to rise (and hence are a better store of value than banks) because the current administration will do whatever it takes (print money) to avoid a stock crash. Basically, companies will continue to be valued about the same, and it will appear that the current bull run continues, but fiat is further diluted. 
2. Real estate: Similar as above, land and property will be valued about the same all things considered, but as fiat is diluted, investment value goes up. However, I think real estate is much more buffered than stocks. If there is a stock crash of 40%, I don't think that will manifest equivocally in real estate. 
3. Bitcoin is great! But there's so much risk from many angles (investment performance, self-management of keys, etc). I have about 2% coin in addition to  and  above in my portfolio. I do think next year will be breakout with the halvening. 
Someone chime in with other investments also worth considering.

Awesome and sounds promising for me! When would you expect Washington (state) support?
