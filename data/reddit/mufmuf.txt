Bitcoin tumbling is where people put money into a pot and then it comes out obfuscated to multiple accounts. So money A goes to Y which goes to B. But so did a bunch of other people's money go to Y and so did a bunch of steps between Y and in separated amounts.

I agree with you. I think you should sell your house and take as many bank loans and payday loans as you can to buy loads of bitcoin yo.

Drones don't pass the economic threshold for weight/cost/stability. Either it crashes on people's heads. Costs well too much to be cost efficient or doesn't carry enough to be cost efficient.

Out of context that sounds horrifying.

Correction. Any increase in value during a perception of undervaluing puts everyone on high alert. They over value it and then it's corrected.

The troll is real.  
If you genuinely think these beliefs you need to have a long and hard look at yourself.

"Many miners will" like who's to say the won't eventually all just follow like sheep?. You assume "many miners" will follow but where's your evidence?. Market forces could crush the other chain to the point of no value. Then if you're a miner which chain are you going to follow? The one with value and the consensus? Or the one with no value and only "morals" or legacy "this is the good old days"
