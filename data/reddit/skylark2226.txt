Good luck getting a response. I'm just hoping to find a good alternative soon and just eating the loss.

Thanks Lunar, this is my second post regarding this now. I've replied to Fred in numerous threads but haven't received a reply from him yet. At this point I've given up on getting this figured out by them. This post was to serve more as a warning to anybody that was considering using Coinbase. 
Since then, I've been using bitfloor without any issues so far. It's just ridiculous how much effort it is taking on the customer's end for them to pay attention to us. Like you said in your post, they are adding new features but neglecting issues such as ours. There is nothing they can do at this point for me to consider using them again.

I'm glad to hear you are at least hearing back from them. I'm still waiting for a reply just hoping for the best.

Has your problem been resolved? I still haven't received a reply from Coinbase.

What else is new? They finally admitted they made a mistake on my account (showing a negative balance) with the following:
I am SO sorry about this! Instead of just looking up your "official" account history, I pulled up the raw data of your activity. There, I see the 10 bitcoin transaction. Wow - I feel really bad about this - I've never seen this problem before and I'm going to look into why this happened right away because this is obviously a serious issue. I'm going to get your account fixed as soon as possible, but I want to figure out how to fix the root cause. I hope you understand - if I just credit your account this could happen to somebody else. Again, my sincere apologies! Thank you for sticking with it and not taking no for an answer!!
I've asked them days ago to just send me my five bitcoins to my address while they are "investigating" this issue. No response as of today.

Fred, please answer my question. How is it that we can have a negative balance? As far as I know we cannot sell bitcoins that we currently don't have on the site and yet your customer service tells me that the negative balance is correct? How is this possible?

Finally got a response for whoever is interested(there may be hope):

I've also just forwarded coinbase the email notice I received from coinbase on the 18th that I deposited 10 btcs. Not sure why this is taking them so long to just respond. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:30:28
fixed, thank you! 
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:17:30
That was the first thing I did. It's been about five hours and still the same thing. Anyways, thanks.

Here was the response by your customer service to my question:
Olaf replied:
After reviewing your account the balance of -5 bitcoin is correct, after your sell of 10 bitcoin on March 28 for $856.30. Sorry about this - we have been having issues with displaying account balances correctly. Normally this shouldn't occur. If I have done the math wrong feel free to shoot us an email. Again, our apologies for any issues this has caused you. Thank you for bearing with us!
I replied showing the 10 btc transfer into coinbase that was not being calculated to this link: 
I should have a balance of 5 btc at this point but instead it is showing -5btc. 
Still waiting for a response.

Mr. CEO, how long should I expect to wait to receive bitcoins that have been incorrectly taken from me?  Your operations is a joke.

Just wanted to update the community that this still has not been resolved. I have received nothing from Coinbase except for the automated email.  
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:28:52
Fred, I've been having an issue and have received one email response from customer service. There is a negative balance showing on my account. How is this possible? 
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:42:06
Thank you!
