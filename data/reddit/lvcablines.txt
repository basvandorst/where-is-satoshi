Celebrated yesterday on a regular Wednesday lunch meet up.
Went to Sunset Pizza (on Tropicana) in Las Vegas.
Forgot to take pictures.
But here is my payment.
Sunset pizza has a great POS the owner developed. qr code is printed on the receipt, and he does NOT instantly sell btc for USD.

I spoke with a couple strip club owners in Vegas. And one more meeting to set up for next month.
Had a fellow bitcoiner with me at one club.  We had an idea to set up a twitter not that would .monitor each girl's BitCoin addy .  then tweet when she gets a tip.  Have a competition who gets the most tips, and other specials..
Owner of one club was totally into it.  His finance guy didn't get it and was a bit slow.  
I've showed a few of the girls, and checked up on them a few months later.  There's a few more girls at the club that are interested now, but not really into it, since not many guys are into it yet.
Some strip clubs have their own currency. "Beaver Bucks" maybe a BitCoin ATM for beaver bucks to start.

LV cabies can accept tips in any form the passenger may offer.
So currently I can only accept BTC tips.
I'm also able to take a break upto a 1hr 15min, any time I like, split up however I want, and do anything (except gamble). For example i could eat lunch, take a nap, pay some bills, or i might purchase some BTC with my personal money during my break.
@_date: 2014-09-04 06:32:02
The solution is a trip to Vegas, with hookers and blow.  Spend all the monies.

I haven't worked for uber or lyft yet, but I think I would prefer them. 
 The company requires 12hr shifts every day, in Nevada cab drivers are exempt from overtime laws.  I started with 6 day work weeks, we went on strike, now my seniority is just barely enough to get a  4 day work week.  I do have the option to get a Geo restricted cab for a 10hr a day shift.  No picking up on fremont st, the strip, or airport.  Ending this shift 2hrs early is optional, and its only optional if there isn't much activity, and got plenty of longer trips (profit for the company) for the day.
My personal car is in better mechanical condition than most of the company cars, and has more comfort features.  Some of the drivers have very nice well kept personal cars, others have a old piece of junk, and I guess they treat the company cars similar to their own.
We are required to not be more than 15% below average on the $ amount put on the meter at the end of the day.  I have been suspended a couple times for being a little below that amount a few times.  Best way to make the minimum, is to know what location is busy and go there after drop off, for the quickest pick up.  Its up to luck and a little knowledge of the crowd that the person is going a longer distance but still some place that will be close to busy.  To make average though will have to cut break short, or skip it.  Pick up on the street not on a stand (illegal), Long Haul (take the longer faster path, usually the interstate also illegal), and some will even run the meter while empty and put their tip money, or pay check into it.

An art store in the container park has dogecoin qr art. And a middle man that will facilitate doge purchases.
I'll do the same thing but for BTC or ltc.
The jerky store has an employee that knows BTC and is trying to talk the owner into it.

Would you settle for strippers and a jack n coke?
A few of the girls at The Horse know a little about BTC. A couple have installed a wallet app.  Along with the owner being interested, but the finance guy not too helpful.
Also a few of the girls at Sapphire and spearmint rhino know a little.  Usually its the girls who also run a website or do some camming.
I have spoken with owners of a couple strip clubs. And should be speaking with one next month, who also happens to be part owner in a cab co.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:53:14
I was at avn.. Few accept BTC. Most have not heard of it. Some are looking into it.
I left a bctip with about 40-50 people that seemed like they were interested and capable of setting up an account.
Some might call me next week.
If they had installed a wallet I would have sent something direct. But no one did.
@_date: 2014-08-19 03:34:15
Forgot to mention, one of the partners that own the cab co. Also own a strip club here in Vegas, I tried to get a meeting with him to see if btc might be possible at the strip club.  Never got the meeting.  There was a mother club that was thinking about it, but they changed owners again.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:39:44
I've showed a few strippers how. Not sure if they get it.
I have a meeting next month with an owner of a strip club in Vegas.
And have met with an owner of a different club. Owner was all for it, but his finance guy was difficult to work with.
Any tips?

I drive a cab in Vegas.
I don't care if you pay cash or card.  Uncle Sam assumes I get 10% tips
The total fares are calculated at the end of the day.  Credit card fares and tips are calculated, and subtracted from my cash turn in.  So the CC tips are less cash that I turn in, that becomes cash in my pocket at the end of the day.
There is a $3 credit card fee that goes to the company, and covers the processing fee, and I'm guessing charge backs.  There's about 15 cab companies in Vegas, all have the same price for the customer, but how they pay the driver is slightly different, one of them gives the driver $0.25 per CC payment.  Some of those companies are all the same.  Yellow, Checker, and Star are the same company I work for them.  
Sometimes I get 3 different paychecks.  I cash them at a casino, and they pay (random amount upto $10k in addition to actual check amount) me to cash them (usually in points around $3/check).
Depending on the person and the trip sometimes I do prefer cash or card. Trips under $10 on the CC machine will show a button for $2, $3, $5 or Other amount of tip. Trips over $10 will show buttons for 20%, 30%, 40%, or other amount.  
Drunk people I prefer to pay in cash, on an $11 trip, they will typically had me a $20 and say to keep the change.  Business people on a long trip (Red Rock Resort $5) usually hit the 20% button for a $10 tip, but only tip $5 in cash.  Some times a drunk person will hit the other button, then press 1,0, and I get a $0.10 tip.  Foreigners I prefer to use CC, because some of them don't know to tip, but some how they know not to expect coins, so that $9.90 trip, i get $0.10,  and i try to go the extra few feet to hit that $10.10 mark so at least i get a $0.90 tip. I carry cash only, and btc...
I accept Bitcoin... last year one of the drivers at the company I work for found and turned in $300k (or $100k some large amount I forget how much) left behind.  I was starting my shift when local news was there interviewing they guy that found the money.  I use a bctip.org card as my card with my name and phone on it, and my twitter or a web link.  Bctip allows you to set up multiple cards for with $1-100 worth of Bitcoin that can be claimed within a month.  Otherwise it goes back to the address the creator set it to.  So I gave the reporter my card, and he came to interview me a few weeks later.
The interview day, was the day the boss found out I was accepting Bitcoin, and he wanted to know a little more about it.  I thought the reporter had cleared things before showing up.  So the boss was a little surprised, and not happy that the reporter was coming to the property.  He said it would be ok to film on a corner near the property though. He did not want to make it look like the company was accepting btc.  After explaining what Bitcoin is he told me it was ok to accept as tips, but not for the fare, since cash is the only thing they will accept at turn in, and only their (square/similar not allowed) credit card system is allowed.
I've only done a few rides for Bitcoin. Missed 2 opportunities to pick up a Bitcoin spender, because of my day off.  Tips can be seen on the blockchain at 1taxinv  off to btc-e cheap coins my phone is dinging at me.

I think its full of customer cash no btc available to sell.
And empty of its supply cash, only able to sell $20 worth btc.. 
I still have about $9k available on my monthly limit.

not sure about the mystery random amount.
I use these 
i could use a sharpie or gimp to block out the amount i guess
i put my contact info in the comment field.

gave a guy a $18.?? ride home, he asked if i could break $100.
he ran into his place to grab the $100, i could break it but all i had was $20s and a single $5... 
so i could only give him $80 or $65.
he wanted $75 back, to leave me with a $6.xx tip
I also had $30 worth of bitcoin on my phone.  we had been talking and he mentioned he did some work for google, so i figured he'd be capable and maybe even willing.
i offered $65 in cash and $10 in btc.  He didnt want to install an app, i had picked him up from a bar, so he had a few drinks in him..
he said he'd feel bad leaving me with a $1 tip, he took the $65 and that was it.

Clarion had no resort fees too, but they caved in (imploded) too

I might know a few drivers that will accept btc.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:51:26
And adult entertainment.
Also I've spoken with some of the strip clubs.  Should have a party ready for SXSW v2v and BlackHat/Defcon (july-august).  bottle service/VIP can be paid in bitcoin, going to have to work on the tipping for lap dances/stage.
Any companies with a booth at any of these events should contact me.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:01:11
I think its Harrahs/Caesar's I've seen advertising no resort fee.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:43:36
Don't take pictures with out permission is all they care about.
I have phone numbers for a few stripers.
Yes the real number, they wanted my number. Not me asking for theirs.
Mostly if they want your number they want to call you on a slow night get you to   come in

Las Vegas cabby here. I accept BTC.
Been driving here for a year.
Still haven't gotten anyone to pay with BTC.
I have given out small amounts of BTC to a few people who were brave enough to install a wallet on their phone, and also tipped generously.
I concentrate my efforts on picking up at computer and payment related conventions (defcon, black hat, money2020). Many (in a related industry) have heard of BTC, but no one had any.
If I do accept a payment they will have the option to pay to 1taxinv.
Had 2 opportunities to accept BTC for a ride. Both were on my day off.
Might be driving someone from CoinDesk around in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:28:41
Stripper in Vegas accepted a tip in BTC.
I don't think she's done anything with it.
Her $5 tip is now worth $30
