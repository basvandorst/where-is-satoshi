Is it possible to trade zcoin.io XZC on Bisq?

Is it possible to configure Tor bridges with Bisq?

Been waiting so long for Samourai. Still having to use mycelium until they sort their shit out. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:30:25
I know but only affects those who were stoopid to give them money.
All I know is I can't use Samourai until they enable hardware capability :(

When is trezor integration happening? Can't be number one without this. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:47:06
Thanks mate, will have a look for it now. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 09:37:31
It's not just me then. I did the same. 
0.1btc to Ether in Jaxx via SS. You need to leave the field blank otherwise it'll try and send (in your case) from a ETH address to a BTC address if I understand your post well. 
I've asked Simon and he's been great in communications so far. I chased it up with SS (Megan) and they said it should bounce back to original wallet address. That's been a week ago so I sent Simon at Decentral another message today. Hopefully he can locate. 
I think the wording of the instructions just need rewriting as I found it a little ambiguous. 
Will update you if I get the 0.1 back to my Jaxx btc wallet.

Can we have meet up details please? Time and other info... 
@_date: 2016-06-25 12:01:40
Great idea but I'll tell you my reasons for not investing in the ICO. 
No apple = slow uptake. 
Fees too high imo. 
ID required which is a massive downside for Crypto fans. 
Can't see it being long before Mycelium or another wallet app integrates this functionality. 
Saying that,  I do wish you the best in your project.  Britain needs all the help it can get with start ups in the next few years. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 12:43:32
I'm android all the way for obvious reasons. I just feel that for you to get the adoption of the geeks trying cryptos for the first time, all those kids sling apple unfortunately

Kraken: it's solid, has 2fa, the charts are easy to read, it has high volume, you can pull out your coins and flip to AUD on localbitcoins by accepting cash deposit and instant credit to your Australian bank account. Seems a little as hassle that what you're currently experiencing.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:01:18
Moonbit is golden!
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:51:01
Why are you using an Australian exchange?
@_date: 2016-06-25 12:39:08
Thanks for the reply. I honestly think your app is a great bridging service and one that I will use... unless a competitor enters the market that allows me to use anonymously and with sub 0.1% fee. Dirty fiat is on a par with dirty debit cards. Two things I like to avoid. Cash &amp; Cryptos are king.

If you lose control of your keys then you have no one to blame. 
That's the problem, 99% of the GP are losers. Let them keep the banks, no thinking required,  it's all laid on. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:36:25
Because they shut down their customers accounts based on how far they are willing to bend over and take a big one from various government departments. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 10:40:33
Proberbly the best reply on Reddit I've seen in a long time. Kudos. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:49:05
Don't see what's wrong with a TAILS stick. It contains most tools needed to survive and can go with you anywhere. You shouldn't need to sync any devices. Cell phone... I have no need for one. Take all photos with a Canon G10 so that's sorted. Electrum over TOR sweet. Key management works. Hook a printer up if needs. 
Everything can remain yours and very private if you lower your expectations in terms of convenience. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:28:02
Agreed. Local control is the only way forward. Don't see what the problem is with maintaing your own privacy,  just takes a little more time. Wrap all your work and notes in pgp and don't be an idiot with your private key.

Commendable but not for me. Paper and pen for notes which has its draw backs but is convenient as fuck for me.

Read on the fly,  didn't see the 8x leverage. Holy shit, he fucked up bad (if that was indeed a true story)

99% of people won't and don't give two satoshis about online privacy. They are the low hanging fruit. We need them,  it's how the system works. You can't force feed it to the general public. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:13:16
Well, at least is was a half decent attempt at something other than a "moon"  post. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:50:33
Localbitcoins.com you'll pay a couple points extra on spot price but it's a more true P2P system, I know who I'm dealing with and I know if I take adequate precautions, my personal data isn't at ANY risk. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:32:18
Chill. In a month she'll be smiling. Only play with what you can afford to lose. The line will track in wiggly fashion but many people including myself have faith in the general direction tracking up. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 06:08:53
Take the plunge. It's not even a leap of faith. Buy a trezor, create key, delete device, try restoring, download, move coins over to device, sleep well at night. 
I've tried all hardware on the market and trezor for me is solid. It looks old school  but it's what I envisage the Russians creating. Excellent.

Anyone who says that on a public forum,  disregard. They wish they got in at $7 and are playing out their own fantasy.  Those that got in at $7 and content and don't need to advertise the fact.

2013 was a hell of a lot different situation than 2017. 4 years in crypto, so much has changed. The ATH was a clear spike do doubt and when you look at the landscape today you know we're on more solid ground. 2013 was even early adopter stage. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:30:13
For some it's an evolution, for me,  it's a project. One of many I'm running concurrently.

Pretty insensitive is an understatement. His comments on this topic will haunt him for a long time.

Considering Ethereum dapps have given us a big fat bag of nothing so far. Not one we can actually use safely, I'd say he's pretty far in front of the competition.

That comment just made my day. Frikkin awesome.

As much as people dislike Kim, that's a killer app right there. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:52:22
I hate to say it but YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. 
1) go to localbitcoins.com 
2) find a reputable seller
3) meet them with cash or deposit cash to their account and receive bitcoins. 
4) Suck up their fees, they do good work and at least you're not giving it to some whore like Coinbase

$900 = clearly designed for those with way too much money and time on their hands.
So many alternatives at a fraction of the price. Just needs some learning and a little time.
