Not all ads are created eqaully. If these guys go on to replace ads with clean (non malcious) non intrusive ads, I will gladly turn off my ad blocker. I want site creators to get ad revenue from me, but I'm not willing to be tracked/ get malware on my computer for it.

I don't really like using TOR for normal browsing.. It's slow and congests the network.
I don't wanna pay for a VPN and free ones aren't a good option either.
 &gt;I think you are lying about it just being the tracking.
I don't really give a fuck. Haha.

You're right, morons be down voting.

Gotcha, so if they have some random 9+ unit password no one is gonna get it anytime soon.

Cool for you, not for him.

It's not truly random. It has a pretty clear pattern to it, though it's not always on point. It goes roughly 2-4 loses in a row, then does a 1-2 win in a row. I played it roughly 50~ times and it was pretty consistent pattern as mentioned. 
Idk how your game works with BTC, but it can't be a fair game or you'll be losing money. Just like casino's don't have fair games. They're not there to give out cash, they're there to rake it in. That's why they only have games that are statistically in their favor or players playing against each other.
It's a fun game aside from all that, but still would be easy to rig. Regardless of your article.

You do realize that dictionary attacks use words and numbers to try to guess the passcode? A random sequence will almost never get cracked.

How does that work? How is it easier if there are less people but gets more difficult with more people?

So, I heard there will be different incentives for mining once the halving starts. How do they get that?

I noticed you could bet what you didn't have. Go on a losing streak and it goes to winning. Place huge bet on winning and score big. I've got over 1 million this way in a few spins..

I thought WPA2 was still unhackable. You could only brute force the password?

Thank you for taking the time to respond. Greatly appreciate it mate.
@_date: 2012-10-24 07:25:27
Yeah, but you gotta have a reset somehow. If they get to 0 and can't play anymore then what? Lol.
 Does the game work the same when you're playing with bitcoin? Personally, I wouldn't play this game for BTC because it would be entirely too easy to rig.

Well that's if you got to an exchange. If you find someone to trade you money for dollars than there is no fee.

Wow, was that just left over in the servers or something? I would have deleted the fuck outta that.

What makes the price on mt.gox? Is it purely people bidding or is there something else that determines price?
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:58:42
Lol, that's not at all how SR works.
