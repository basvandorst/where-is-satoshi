Hey! I saw a few threads back that Coinstar sells bitcoin in cash, has anybody use this service before, is it safe? Would it be safe after regulations? (dirty? KYC? etc)

@_date: 2019-07-23 14:56:33

A few weeks back i posted a question about Crypto exchanges, fees, speed, security, etc and thank you, everyone, for your advice. I decided to go with coinbase pro, I made a deposit and its been over 5 business days and im still not able to trade since my funds havent been cleared. 
Could it be the way i provided my bank info? In order to add funds, I needed to either, enter my Bank of America login credentials into the coin base pro website or provide my routing/account number and then a few days later verify the small deposits they have made in order to confirm the account. I did the later but im still yet to be able to trade. 
Could my bank be slowing me down? I had Bank of america when trading in Coinbase regular and the reposit usually went through in couple days but now im on a Credit Union and it seems to be taking forever and i cant wait to buy more Crypto!
Thank you for your thoughts!

\-For some reason im unable to create a post (used different browsers and computers) so ill post here and without the screenshot
Hello, my fellow forward-thinker! Couple weeks ago i posted a question regarding the best exchanges for a certain type of trade i was looking for, i decided to go with Coinbase Pro. 
About a week ago I sent a WIRE (or at least i thought it was a WIRE and not an ACH) I might be doing something wrong or overthinking this. So, I got my refund back into my bank account yesterday automatically (which I'm very glad) but that means the wire wasn't set up correctly. Usually, for a wire transfer, all you need is the name of the business, address and account  Should I use the bank name and bank address or the recipient name and address? (the screenshot would show 2 addresses and 2 business names) If they no longer use reference numbers, how do they know to deposit the funds in your account? 
Also, Coinbase explicitly states in the deposit info (screenshot attached) "be careful not to send an overnight or same-day ACH", how can i tell my bank not to send an ACH and rather a WIRE? Any helpful comment is greatly appreciated, thanks!!!

I got couple questions about wire transfers if you don't mind. I'd like to try this way but is it KYC?how true is it that any BTC that is not kyc "certified" can be some how repossessed or marked as dirty? Is it true that if you purchase BTC through your bank (fiat) the government can trace that BTC all over. If this is true or not, what would the pros(if any) and cons could be?
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:48:47
what exactly do you mean by "mix". I get my cypto from coinbase and send it directly to my HW wallet, what is the benefit of a wasabi wallet in the middle?

First thing i bought before any crypto was a HW wallet (ledger X made the process super simple)

Im posting the coinbase pro deposit SCREENSHOT. Usually, for a wire transfer, all you need is the name of the business, address and account  (hid the actual account numbers). Should I use the bank name and bank address or the recipient name and address? If they no longer use reference numbers, how do they know to deposit the funds in your account? Also, everybody talks about being able to get the funds the same day if sent before a certain time, which is confusing to me since coinbase explicitly states in the deposit info (screenshot attached) "be careful not to send an overnight or same-day ACH", how can i tell my bank not to send an ACH and rather a WIRE? Any helpful comment is greatly appreciated, thanks!!!

When is the halvening happening?
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:58:18
Thanks! yea i was able to link my 2 different bank accounts but i didnt receive any "code", i did get the 2 small deposits, i was able to verify the accounts that way and I'm able to send money that way too but isnt that also ACH? Where do you suppose to enter the reference code once you are on your bank portal, notes maybe?
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:34:56
I agree with the other comments, how is USA leading the way exactly? Lol
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:28:56
Im wondering about this as well, im using coinbase pro and im guessing how are they going to know to which one is my account without a reference number, also I see 2 address, recipient and bank address, which one should i use, did you completed your wire transfer successfully?
@_date: 2019-10-11 20:57:12
I'll check it out, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:32:37
And of course i cant seem to be able to add the screenshot to this reply comment...ugh
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:36:31
People have provided couple options for you to then do your research, start researching about wasabi/samurai wallets and educate yourself without feeling "disrespected" lol
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:40:09
Thanks a lot! I'll do some more research! I'm glad I ran into this post!
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:27:51
Could you please expand on this?
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:35:31
This is technically correct, but the banks are making the difference from the fees rather than interest now, one way or another, they will try to get the money
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:38:16
Removed! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:11:50
So far you are the only one to mention this again, where can I read more into this, can someone else confirm this? So you are saying anybody that buys "BTCs" from CB are not actual BTCs?
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:07:01
So I just have mention I always pull my crypto from the exchange into my hardware wallet, are those actual BTCs?
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:09:44
I should have mentioned I always pull my crypto from the exchange into my hardware wallet, are those actual BTCs?
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:26:14
Thanks a lot sorry for asking the same shit over and over but need to make sure I understood correctly
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:05:42
Ok so I always transfer to my hardware wallet as soon as I'm able to from CB, with that said, those are actual BTCs correct?
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:12:39
I've been able to transfer my crypto from Coinbase to my hardware wallet within seconds, are the BTCs in my hardware wallet not actual BTCs?

Hi, quick questions if you don't mind, what do you mean in the whole paragraph "they function exactly like a bank, take 10 bucks give 100 fictional, also what do you mean by their own chain? Are those somewhere not real crypto assets when moving them to a harder wallet?

Most of the coins are either US dollars or MX peso

Now we know who would sell during the first "scary" dip lol HODL!
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:21:45
Do your research...
Reddit and this sub is great for finding quick answers and hopefully getting pointed the right way, you gotta do the rest man tho.
