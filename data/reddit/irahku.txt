It is a mathematical task that is computationally difficult enough that it requires computing power, the more computing power a miner has the more likely they are to win that lottery.

This may go down in history as the first paper about btc from a traditional financial institution  that wasnt retarded.

Yeah i wouldn't try to time lock it, for the reasons below as well as its more to mess with (higher chance of user error)

Currently bitcoin can be denominated in satoshis 1/100m of a bitcoin, if needed we can always increase the granularity so that  we can go to a billionth of a bitcoin (this is currently done on lightning and will likely be done on chain as well in the future)
Or you could alter bitcoin core (which i believe would make it incompatible with the current software implementation) so that any holder of a bitcoin has 10 bitcoins on the new chain increasing the total supply, 
the four biggest places that need work  in bitcoin are:
1. solving mining centralization (Matt Corallo has an excellent paper on a way to reduce mining centralization, it is rather technical though)
2. layer two solutions (lightning)
3. key management
4. privacy
people losing bitcoins, while unfortunant for the individual is NOT a threat to the network.

IMO what you invest in bitcoin should be proportional to the amount of time you have invested in learning about it.
