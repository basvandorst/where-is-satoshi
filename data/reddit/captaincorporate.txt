I am definetly expecting someone to do "fiatmarketcap.com" and make this a reality. It probably won't get as much attention as coinmarketcap but definetly can be a great fun thing to do.

Yeah, since there are a whole bunch of (literally millions) of kurds around the region but they have no country, they have to make do with a region called Kurdistan in North Iraq. If I had that same issue I would be sensitive about it too.
 They take every sentence about kurdistan with a grain of salt. Its like talking to a black person in civil war era as a "northern" white man. You can be helping them, but you aint one of them.

Exactly, I was trying to help clear that up. People tought I was saying “There is no kurdistan he is a tereorist!!!” Or some fucked up thing. All I did was by example he said Florida and I said Florida is in USA .

I am assuming from “kurdistan” he probably means East Turkey or North Iraq. Since there is no literal “kurdistan” country nowhere.  You can check prices on Iraq or Turkey instead...

Its ok. Since its a sensitive subject, people tend to take helpful answers as racist, I knew it might sound nationalist instead of helpful even while typing. As a Turkish person I get accustomed to highly sensitive reactions even when you do nothing wrong.

Not similar at all. Trump is potus for 3-7 years. Kurds had this issue for decades. I hope countries get together to find a middle ground for it. Hell those bad ass motherfuckers some call terrorist is actually fighting ISIS so we wont have to.
