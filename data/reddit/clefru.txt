"Dr Craig Wright was suspected as the creator following a report by Wired last year and he has now confirmed his identity as the cryptocurrency's founder."
Please never link to the dailymail ever again.

I am happy about being ripped off by 5% instead of 20-30%, which is the usual EU-region markup. See  ..
and this service allows me to work around when using a US VPN.

Thanks for the code!

Your citations don't support your claim. Could you please update them? In particular, Raptor claim to use: "1 ASpeed BMC with OpenBMC". ASpeed as search term does not appear in the articles linked. Also it seems that first article on BMC attack vectors is speculation.
Don't get me wrong, BMC security is important, and that's why Raptor gives you the source with OpenBMC and you can recompile it yourself.

After x years in Bitcoin and hearing this story many times, it only today occurred to me that by publishing the Genesis block on 2009/01/3 with a newspaper reference from the 2009/01/03, Satoshi proved that he did not pre-mine the chain.
(He could have pre-mined without that reference, for instance by lets say starting a month earlier and whenever somebody found a new block, he could release two blocks from his stash to outpace the other blocks. With that reference he had to start at the same time as everybody else and compete fairly. Satoshi was awesome.)

Before installing, absolutely make sure that the md5sums match!
Maybe the pip installer can parse the md5sum anchor and checks this already? I have little experience with pip. Can somebody verify?

Full ACK. Electrum mnemonics have enough entropy and can be remembered easily.

Far more important than deletion, do a test recovery of your wallet! Also back up to more than just a thumb drive.
Personally, I would pick a high entropy password,  wrap it in GPG, and upload the encrypted wallet to cloud storage. Now I am sure that some people freak out about that...
