Or he is a no-coiner

The same principle should be applied to the opposite side.
1. Truth is relative btw.
2. Therefore, don't ask a bitcoin maximalist on bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.
3. Dont' ask a bitcoiner about banks.
4. Don't ask a airbnber about hotels.
5. Don't ask the internet on about news.
Hence, your points are not valid in the grand scheme of things.

Yes, clearly this guy is talking BS. Seems like he prepared very well and is reading it from a script in his mind. 0 authenticity.

2.3 $ trillion tax money went missing from the pentagon in the USA. What about that my friend?

Damn, what an easy way to make money when let's say you are the... attorney general of new york.

Guaranteed the next GTA will have a lot of crypto reference and missions. So much potential.

Only if they can find them, yes. You really think it's hard for example the chinese government to track those companies? Electrical network data can be measured, you have to buy the equipment somewhere, you need the infrastructure, you need a license, you need the right people. I wouldn't say the mining business is as underground as you are saying. If they want to, they can cut off the power anytime.

Couldn't governments just close down the big miners?

I'm not disagreeing on his statement, I just pointed out it's very general.

this is huge for the cryptospace if the public media pushes it further and tries to bring "bitcoin" into the alt right scene, etc

In what way? In stability? - no. But I take profit over stability, so yeah .. btc &gt; gold
