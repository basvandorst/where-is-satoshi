Tldr : I'm an engineer working on train systems. Feinstein has pushed 'safety system' bills that are costing the industry billions, while actually making trains slower and less safe.
Details: Google 'positive train control'. The way the law is setup effectively gave one company a monopoly. Their system fails often but, when it works, tells the engineers exactly what to do. (Railroads don't have speed limit signs or anything... the operators memorize the route and speed restrictions.) When the system doesn't work somewhere, the operators are much more likely to exceed the speed, because they are simply out of practice. The FRA has even documented into their recommendation to congress that this would occur.
This trend of increased risk is already visible on the Northeast Corridor where most trains have PTC working, but the accident rate has gone up.

You may be being facetious, but the engineer not knowing where he was is what killed those people on the Amtrak train north of Philly. 
People sometimes miss there stop; but the engineer does it and it gets people killed.

It's not as silly as it sounds.
* Trains have thousands of miles of track with (mostly) infrequent train
* They operate in weather where the signs wouldn't be able to be seen.
* Due to the large network and it being largely unused, signs are likely to be stollen vandalized.
* There are also issues where different trains have different speed limits. The most obvious example is that on the same track an Acela, a passenger coach and a freight have different speed limits.

There are, but it's no longer an off the shelf GPS unit. It's a wheel counter, or inertial sensor, or transponders or something else. Those each have failure modes that need to be considered. In older tunnels signs just don't fit; the trains barely fit.

GPS doesn't work in train tunnel or (some) stations

You memorize the location based on milepost. Speed restrictions are generally located at curves or switches (the loud part of the track). You can tel you are going over this with your eyes shut.
There are also, in some places, wayside signals that are lit.
