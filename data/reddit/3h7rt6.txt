I saw the post this one is referring too. Redditor was complaining about wanting 25k in lieu of bounty payment schedule laid out by Coinbase (5k in this specific vulnerability) they only posted a screen shot as "proof" of the first vulnerability(acknowledged by Coinbase). no proof on their second vulnerability found and Coinbase cannot recreate exploit. 
Fortunately, privacy laws prevent Coinbase from blasting all over public media the reasons for redditors accounts restrictions. However the redditor did indicate that after their wallet/account was "locked" they went on to find another vault exploit. (what was the purpose of doing this on a locked account?) As well as the last half of their posting becoming a little confusing on the chronology of events.
I think Coinbase response to this situation is more than adequate and appropriate given both parties statements.

Use a cold storage brain wallet
Come up with a password, and hash it with  [HashCalc]( with SHA256 option,
that will be your private key.
Use your private key in [Armory ]( [bitaddress.org]( to derive the bitcoin payment address and use that as your cold storage brain wallet
Then use your regular wallet as a hot wallet and just transfer your bitcoins from there to your brain wallet.
@_date: 2012-11-13 16:00:48

@_date: 2012-07-05 12:15:01
I have two wallets. The first is my cold storage (savings wallet), using the first and only address that is satoshi client shows as the savings address. I then encrypt that wallet into a tiny TrueCrypt container, upload it to various cloud services that I have an account with E.g. Google drive, Skydrive, Amazon....etc and purge that wallet from my computer. 
Then I create my hot wallet (checking basically) for regular transactions. I regularly encrypt with TrueCrypt and backup to cloud services for security. When there gets to be too much bitcoins in it for my comfort (A juicy target for thieves) I simply send most of them to the address on my savings wallet, leaving enough to work with in my hot wallet, but not enough to hurt me if I lose them.
This way I'm not having to meddle with off line paper backups. As in my opinion they are less secure than an on line encrypted cold storage solution. Seeing that they can be easily lost I.e burned up in a house fire, misplaced, stolen and less accessible than redundant cloud services should I need to access it when away from home.

Your condescending "sigh" suggest that I'm the ignorant one (bite me) when we are both on the same level of understanding. When all you are doing is merely outbidding me. Ill point out that your 10 cent increase above my bid is still well below the more popular exchanges and well above some less popular exchanges. So you bid of $6.10 doesn't invalidate mine. My confidence in the bitcoin market given the general history of price especially when we take into account the great bitcoin crash of 2011 sits at $6. And if we look at the the price fluctuations of this days market we see the price has fluctuated 73 cents between $6.95 and 6.22. My bidding lower than you has the potential to lock in higher gains with fewer offers  while your higher bid has the potential for more offers with smaller gains. And inter fund transfers between paypal accounts does not incur a fee.

I really don't understand the need for a physical offline wallet stored on a USB drive (Seems dangerous how easily it can be lost in that form E.g. misplaced, stolen, broken, destroyed in house fire or flooding incident...etc.) I created a separate wallet with one address for cold storage using live OS disk so nothing is saved to my hard drive. Encrypt cold storage wallet with TrueCrypt and upload it to a few cloud storage solutions that are free with an account like Amazon, Google drive, Microsoft skydrive, etc.

Bitcoin rules of acquisition. [Rule  was my personal take as bitcoin is designed to remove banks. And using any service other than your own personal wallet to store bitcoins is basically treating them as the bank. [Dumb people]( keep [breaking this rule]( and bitcoins keep getting [stolen from 3rd party wallets]( over and [over]( and [over](
Its fine it you want to use an exchange to trade but don't use it to store your bitcoins longer than confirmation time required.

Their "About us" section says 14 years in the field. You think 14 years would yield a far more information and product rich site than their scammy one.

I didn't know it was free, but I paid for it twice on purpose to support Mr. Stross. I had a paperback copy and searched high and low on line to find a Hardcover to purchase so it would keep in my library for many years.

I've done what you are worried about. 
   I have a brain wallet and sometimes I open up Armory and import it in there to spend a few bitcoins. the first time I did it I did not realize that Armory spends an entire input and kicks back the change to a generated address in the wallet file (otherwise that change would go to a miner whether its 0.005btc or 13btc any left over imput becomes a miners fee thats why clients generate new addresses to send leftover inputs to) 
So after I sent some bitcoins I closed Armory and deleted the wallet because I did not want my brain wallet keys residing on my computer. What I didn't realize was that [13btc where kicked back to a new address]( **16pYrhAkuvcyECFP58wW9zxRNottzBvB9P** So I had to use a recovery program to undelete the file, unfortunately it was encrypted and partially corrupted. So I'm still in the process of trying to recover the private key to that address.
