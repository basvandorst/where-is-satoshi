Then it's not really yours, is it?

That's hilariously untrue. Hyundai and Kia wormed their way in, despite being synonymous with cheap garbage for years. Walmart exists by being cheap. You literally list Amazon, and pretend it got its market share from high quality service, and then list its speed as what gives it good service.
If Bitcoin continues to be terrible at being spent forever, at some point something will replace it as a blockchain based currency. That's not a reflection on it as a deflationary bullion or its value, but something better will replace it. Or lighting is what it's hoped to be, and a lot of alt coins bottom out.

Sure, but if you take the value of Bitcoins in loaves of bread, pizzas, lambos, iPhones or gold bars, one Bitcoin can acquire 40% of what it was able to a few months ago.

A correction in a stock price is usually because its potential earnings are being overvalued. Can you explain to me why the price of $8k is a more appropriate price for Bitcoin than $19k?

Dude, this is literally about using Bitcoin ATMs. There's obviously nothing wrong with cashing out. But if you have the option of using an ATM or not using an ATM and using cash on hand instead (and then cashing out the same amount of bitcoin through better channels) you'd have to be pretty punishingly stupid to use an ATM.

Can you explain why, when you had an emergency purchase to make, but did have the cash on hand, you chose to pay high fees to liquidate part of your portfolio? When I need a drink of water I turn on the tap, I don't put ice cubes in the microwave.
