That's it... Once in a while there will be a price correction but history says that after each correction btc gains a new value at least 50% higher than lowest dip point, so keep HOLDing :o)
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:47:33
hahaha that's rigth!

There are lots of things that can be done to help people without giving them money directly... So many people just need their opportunity to change their and other's people life ... Is like the what is happening with BTC but in some kind of different way... BTC has no feelings so it can't help or even identify to those who really need it but we can make the difference to enhance its uses... with this kind of things for example... as you're doing now.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:12:44
totally agree with u!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:19:26
I dont think that there would be a transition in terms of making FIAT currencies be obsolete ... Most probably it is that crypto currencies in general will gain market capitalization in terms of transactions across the globe and will reduce the use of FIAT money as we know it
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:05:48
Well, that's right but I think that this division will not affect the bitcoin itself but rather it will set a preceding that will set the basis for other cryptocurrencies to do the same... For me division it's more like a phenomenun (like inflation) produced by the interaction of this types currencies within a market with lots of different stakeholders involved with very divergent interest, which (in my opinion) it's hardly unavoidable in any kind of crypto currencie
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:29:38
For now I recommend you to invest in bitcoins, it's still on its early days... About your question, keep updated EVERYDAY in this kind of forums 'cause it will help you a lot in getting know about those "big things". 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:55:10
It's HODL! not hold... LOL!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:09:41
Hi. No, isn't too late... Bitcoin market capitalization is getting higher so price will raise... Remember ALWAYS to be informed before invest. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:49:38
Well, in my opinion first of all you have to know very well the terms involving BTC and market and get informed about the tools used to analyze market behaviour (like cryptowatch) ... Then invest at least in two differents things in order to achieve a balance in your investments: destinate part of your money for trading and the other one in savings.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:05:48
Bitcoin won't be different from others commodities in this scenario... Speculation will always be around the market, it will always emerge and will affect the price of bitcoin, but it's not a inherent feature of it, if you know what I mean... This crypto currency was made for facilitate world level transaccion's at minumum rates, the rest is product of market behaviour and the other "big" part is due to speculation.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:11:52
That's rigth... Very well explained!
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:51:15




I'm glad to read that! I wish you all the success for your invesments!
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:33:39
You can talk to a friend, uncle, brother, cousing, sister, etc, and ask him/her if he/she can "authorize" to do the job for you, if you know what I mean...
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:07:30
However it's a good advice to consider other crypto currencies even more when you're starting in this. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:58:10
And this is just the begining... So HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:59:18
You're welcome my friend! Despite of your knowledge level on this sub will ALWAYS receive respect and consideration... Go ahead!
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:29:56
Well, he is brilliant at bussiness and probably has already seen the advantages of bitcoin use in the economy... Furthermore, blockchain technology itself it's already really attractive to goverments, so in general we can expect some goverment actions involving btc and Blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:51:42
It's a good advice but BTC it's a good starting point because of its popularity...
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:53:16
Yeah man, this is really crazy and it's just the begining! 
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:57:46
That's true... I believe that the most you can do is to talk about your experience with BTC and ALWAYS mention the risks associated first!
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:54:39
Well, always the amount that you can afford to lose is associate with the circumstances of the moment and not with the amount itself, so in my opinion that depends of your current financial situation.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:58:11
Totally agree with you!
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:32:16
In my opinion you should wait, lightning will take time in coming
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:50:35
That's right Kalin101! Completly agree with you!
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:50:36
That's right Kalin101! Completly agree with you!
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:22:19
Great! ... Remember always learn very well this 3 rules: 1) Invest all the money you're afford to loose. 2) Don't panic 3) Always HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:01:11
Please, let us know when you have any doubt about it
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:00:09
Because is the only currency in the whole world that's not subject to inflation but it's deflative instead. And when you have an asset that instead of lossing value trough time but gains it, should be treated as  a very very good investment.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:52:20
Human fear...
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:05:27
Well in my opinion you should invest now and "don't" wait for a crash... But, if that were the case don't panic, bitcoin has demostrated that generally it will always recover from this kind of events and will raise its price
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:32:26
Hi! You can buy Amazon GC and exhange it for btc at purse.io with a discount rate... Also try 
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:44:30
Hi... Don't worry for this, it's a normal behaviour of the market... This is not the first time that this kind of dip occurss and it won't be the last... The general recommendation here is HODL! So don't panic and wait ... Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:27:45
OMG! Wow! It seems that paranoia has taken over the adults around you! LOL! ... I think that you made a great decision. Despite what  "closed mind" people can say, bitcoin is the best invention ever made over the internet... And for the records, the most used currency in the world for criminals is the US Dollar! I wish you all the success you can achieve!
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:54:47
For me the real thing about bitcoin if the initial manifest which makes it work, no matters if it was created by SN, a corporation or aliens from the future.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:50:14
At this site verification process it's a very easy thing to do... Try it!
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:52:26
I really recommend to you to investigate about ETHEREUM and BYTEBALL!
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:07:08
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:58:34
I think that soon, very soon it gonna hit the moon very very hard!!!
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:51:39
That's correct... We don't have to worry about this 'cause bitcoin it will always recover .. So HODL!
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:51:48
I never have read source code but (as a programmer) I really think that's not the way how bitcoin maximum is defined.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:13:25
You'll forget your regret when bitcoin raises up to $USD 10.000 before one year from now! And you'll be happy again! LOL!
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:03:29
Try using  to convert your BTC in your local currency, it does have really cheap rates
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:07:19
Well, for example, trough purse.io you can exchange your bitcoins for different kind of stuff on amazon at a very attractive discount rate, 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:47:06
It's bad to read that... Try coinbase ...
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:31:19
i'm in but USE is the hugest indicator rather than price... in that scenario price is a derivative value, just my opinion :O)
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:12:12
You're welcome!
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:49:26
Well if you think your invesment in btc gave you losses in terms of the actual market price, so you're right ... But think about it, last year 1 bitcoin worth less than $USD 1.000 and at that time there was various events that dipped the price but now here we are with a market price over $USD 4.000 (incremented by 300% more in just 7 months) ... Take your conclusions.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:11:41
Thanks for the info! Unfortunately This is a very common issue with this kind of  companies
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:57:45
Bitcoin is the change of future through its core technology today "blockchain"... So we have to see forward, no backward... So I don't think there's any regrets but I'm very happy this is really happening!
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:07:41
purse.io accepts it indirectly
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:05:09
Can you tell me if the failure occurs before of after LB ask you for the 2FA ?
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:10:29
They gives you a prepaid Mastercard that you can pay with bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:26:28


Well, ethereum's market capitalizacion has grown and that's a well known indicator that currency will be used in the future and will raise its price as this capitalizacion continue to grow
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:02:20
That's correct... And no matter how strong bitcoin is, there's always a factor that technology can't change itself: irrational human fear... This demonstrates that technology really, really needs to evolutionate hands off with education.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:16:21
And in my opinion it will increase more and more... But if you want to know more about price changes feel free to read this article... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:10:48
Hi. Yeah, this is a very really big change in everyones life who uses bitcoins... I really recommend to you ALWAYS hold your investments and try to diversify all what you can so you can count with more than one source of incomes... Have a nice life!
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:27:23
We all are in the rigth direction with bitcoin, please don't doubt about it!
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:30:29
Look at this:
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:45:57
That's why you always have to HOLD! The difference here is that you should spent your money but not your btcs :p ... BTC is freedom for the future, FIAT money is JAIL from present LOL!
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:49:36
That's correct, but today there's a lot of sites where you can use your bitcoins easily
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:07:28

It seems a very good idea, very good... How can we accomplish that?
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:32:30


Holly cow yeah!
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:15:00
Hi, i can explain it to you if you agree to pay me $15 in btc for the explanation... 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:46:47
"I'm happy that I can finally be in control of my life" ... This is the best you can do for yourself... But, even when you're the final decision taker, don't forget at least to listen to other people and pay attention to the oldest guys 'cause there's a lot of useful information that you can use for your convenience... It's just an advice. Success!
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:01:09
For me the best is 
it's safe, trusted and very easy to buy and sell bitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:09:39
Take a look at: 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:59:10
You're welcome! Have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:53:24
Hi. This is one of the best decisions you ever made in your life, but I really recommend to you keep updated and ALWAYS learn more and more, all what you can, about investments... Remember that bitcoin is a currency very different from the others ones but is used by human beings who by the way are very speculatives 
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:50:53
You're welcom! Please feel free to contact us if you need more information! Sucess!
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:08:10
I think that for now bitcoin has to evolutionate itself before looking forward for new tech on the horizon... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:15:31
Now is time to buy the more you can and then HODL! Nothing else. Bitcoin value will always raise, always man! 
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:03:57
jajajajajaja
