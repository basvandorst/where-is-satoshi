They are selling because they bought a house apparently...
I don't buy that...but of course they are selling because surely the next generation of miners is coming out soon, and difficulty is about to rise.
Also, I can google it with the best of them...
Still doesn't answer my question really...I know it is going to go up a few% points...but that won't make 1.5TH machines obsolete just yet.
I having been mining alt coins since february by the way...not a noob, but not an expert...

thanks...all things considered, I think if you are in it for the long haul...it will be worth it as the price rises.
Or else, it would be best to stay clear and just buy the btc instead.

thanks bro

Quebec is crooked as FUCK...They will smile and let you in...they proceed to ream you up the ass.
Hydro Mafia and the government have no mercy.

Why Nova scotia?
They were vancouver based and wire transfers were going to poland/hong kong ect ect...
I don't get it.
personally, when I heard the dude died, after all the issues they have had the last few years...I tend to believe its an exit scam of epic proportions.

still, Quadriga was incorporated in BC, and had "offices" there...

miners sell on exchanges, and with fees so high, btc becomes more of a store of value, which makes no sense to spend.
@_date: 2019-06-04 19:57:16
who said BTC was legal tender?
gtfo with that nonsense.
Ask them if you broke any laws, then demand them to unfreeze your accounts.
selling something for canadian currency does not imply you are exchanging legal tender for another...
you could have sold a lawn mower, that is also not legal tender but you will be paid in CAD

open ban accounts offshore and use those to deposit/make purchases/trade ect
EU and all its member countries are a bunch of police states...
isn't democracy wonderful?
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:21:08
thank you sir, I will look into this further.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:35:49
I am sorry, that is not an option.
Either way, I am sending it out....it doesn't mater where I send it.
Trading is a risk, so is walking across the street everyday.
I have full faith that binance will be around for the longer term.
Also, without traders, there would be no one to buy or sell from.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:16:54
appreciate the detailed answer and that makes perfect sense.
We both have this wallet, she since 2016, and myself since 2015 and earlier.
It worked fine, but now these fees are just stupid.
I will setup a different wallet after this is over.

3 options to send 30$ USD
regular 1+ hour $5.28
priority 0-60min $6.72
custom (YOU DECIDE, no guarantee it ever gets confirmed or stuck)
no economy speed.

We are using blockchain.info wallet and I can set a custom fee...I just have no idea if it will ever go through.
What wallet would you recommend for IOS iphone to use RBF?
How does RBF work to make it cheaper to send BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:03:39
so I shouldn't us blockchain.info?
Alright I can switch, we started with this one for her in 2016.
I will have her switch, any recommendations for an IOS wallet that doesn't rape the user?
Also, if I can do a custom sat/byte to send, what # would be optimal and go through?
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:58:34
blockchain.info IOS iphone wallet
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:14:46
hey, thanks!
That was most helpful.
You also seem like a nice guy.
Have a great day.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:30:43
actually, that might be a good idea!
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:12:48
alright thanks.
Another question,
according to this 
if I use 
61 sat/B	to send my tx, it will get there in ≤ 6 hours.
Do you think this is correct?
Want to avoid getting tx stuck for 4 days. :(
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:36:51
I am wondering what the lowest Sat/byte can be.
I don't mind waiting, i just dont want to get stuck and not have recourse.
