I saw some links going by coindesk.us being submitted here earlier. I wonder if someone has created a duplicate of their site.
I'm pretty sure CoinDesk doesn't use a .us TLD for their site.

I received these numbers directly from BitPay on Tuesday. CoinDesk has a similar report today.
I received the same doubt from this community when I broke the Overstock story last year.
Skepticism is healthy, so I don't take it personally. But I just want everyone to know that I don't put articles together for page views/ad clicks/whatever else. I love bitcoin just as much as the next guy here. :)

Hey there!
We published a post on this with the video a few days ago [here](
Really wonderful stuff.

It *is* very hard. I've been running a small bitcoin news website at newsbtc.com for almost a year. I've been criticized, insulted, and generally not trusted despite my best intentions. It's all in a day.
I spend over 50 hours per week on my site *in addition* to working 50+ hours weekly at a day job. All for the amount of page views a potential advertiser would scoff at.
I enjoy writing about bitcoin, though. So, there's that. As someone who deals with depression and anxiety, everyday is a challenge. I share your struggle.
Best to you.
