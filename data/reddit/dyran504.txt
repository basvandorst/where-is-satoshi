I think you're forgetting a major aspect about bitcoin, it is transparent. If you don't want to use a bank which runs on fractional reserve banking, then you don't have too.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:36:05
well I would strongly suggest not to do this, as you may know. Bitcoin keeps track of every transaction, coinbase would indefinitely know what you are doing. There are ways how ever to mix your coins after purchasing them from coinbase. I would still advise not to use BTC to buy drugs online, even after mixing them.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:20:35
Sure, but they are always going to know you have BTC if you purchase the BTC with your debit card. You should look into localbitcoins and get them with cash.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:37:15
Its always a good time to buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:14:48
isn't the creation of BTC supposed to be limited by the difficulty of mining?
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:03:35
It took about a week
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:56:17
There are services that automatically sell the btc on an exchange and pay out in USD, such as BitPay or coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:39:20
Would she rather him buy drugs on the street with USD?
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:02:15
Thanks I'm glad you drink our product and enjoy it. We work hard over here making coffee all week, it always makes me feel good knowing that people love it so much.
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:31:46
Yeah, make a new address in your wallet and send them to it.
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:58:06
I know one sports fanatic I work with that came to me and asked if I heard about this game. He was pretty psyched to see Bitcoin and Football together.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:40:00
He doesn't hate bitcoin or anything, he is very tech savvy. He is very hard headed and he doesn't want to believe the current system needs to be fixed. He is still unsure on the network and he has his doubt's on how the system works. Maybe all the emails will drive him to do more research on the BTC system, and he will see that it is not just a big scam, but the revolutionary technology that it is. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:21:28
But, you've been able to purchase things using NFC on your phone since 2011, if anything apple is playing catch up with google.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:05:03
So, even though I plan on giving all these away its not allowed...
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:11:42
What do you mean it doesn't function the same as Apple Pay? Last I checked they do the same thing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:41:17
Isn't it great I bought a hemp tail. For .003btc
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:28:03
We extract the coffee with cold water, which is cold brewing, its pretty much the same thing that you are describing. We do it on a much greater scale with large tanks that are pressurized with cold water.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:39:30
What I mean is they are not building any rockets, they are signing contracts with Space-x and Boeing.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:17:56
Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of a decentralized currency
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:45:51
I don't really care about the amount of sales we have, but just having BTC as a payment option will assist the network by having more places for people to spend their BTC. I'm not doing this to generate more profits, but to increase awareness and usability of crypto currencies.
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:50:33
I agree, they make it almost impossible to make purchases on mobile with BTC. You have to switch to desktop site to do it.
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:48:44
I had this idea a week ago, but I envisioned it decentralized. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:37:39
It is an ounce of silver, I paid 0.05 BTC for it.
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:56:15
It is very nice, I can't wait for their android app
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:00:17
Nicely said, I am also a 20y/o with no prior economics experience, but bitcoin caught my eye back in 2010. I was too young to invest, but I put my gaming computer to work mining. I only ran it for a couple of weeks before I got tired of the heat and noise in my room.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:52:54
that is an odd bottle, I'm going to show this to my dad maybe we can work on something like this.
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:04:01
Lol revoke the right to encryption. Since when do they have any power over what I use my computer for. There will be encryption if they say it is unlawful or not.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:55:40
But you would want to contact Space x or Boeing if we wanted to get a big Bitcoin logo on the side of it.
@_date: 2014-05-08 16:02:21
Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2014-10-17 21:52:07
I better go arrest that ATM for letting people get cash for drugs.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:11:21
yeah... spell check
@_date: 2014-11-13 02:34:19
I have a very similar story. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:31:25
I began to get skeptical because the tracking number didn't work but I kept in contact with support and it took about a week.
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:30:29
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:31:01
Like I said in an earlier post, I'm not expecting a huge jump in sales. This is to supply the bitcoin network with yet another merchant.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:23:44
Nice video! I wish there was a bitcoin ATM by me.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:50:34
I'm with ya on that one.
@_date: 2014-11-14 03:13:07
oh, I know that is not a mesh network, actually that's why I brought it up. Someone was worried about censorship. I told them that the solution was mesh networks.
@_date: 2014-09-28 03:52:00
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:17:36
They should give a 1%-5% discount for using bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:52:34
We need to be pushing our local communities to begin adopting bitcoin  imagine going to a local farmers market or grocery store and paying with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:21:56
Hmm... I can't remember how long it really took. Maybe they've changed the process since I've bought some
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:28:49
Doesn't coin kite use these kind of cards? Would this make it easier for them to enter the US.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:04:08
That's my 750ti mining vertcoin
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:36:39
Lol, since when is NASA building any rockets.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:55:02
Yeah I drink a lot of coffee myself. I'm up to like 5 cups a day. I'm sure we won't be the merchants that drop bitcoin support. I'm way to into it, I've been following it for five years now,and I love the idea crypto currencies bring of a free market.
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:05:46
Is this real or just some bs 
@_date: 2014-10-27 17:43:12
We could always boycott gyft and use one of the multiple other services that do the same thing as them
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:21:01
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:51:39
I got it, but I signed up for an invite the day they announced the promo
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:11:13
I use Ally, never had an issue.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:49:50
Let's convince Snoop to make a song about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:16:16
It takes 4 days to confirm your bank account, unless you used a credit card.
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:56:31
Could it have been caused by multipools directing large amounts of hashes?
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:38:39
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:38:52
I'm glad you had a good experience using Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:10:24
TIL, I am Obsessed
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:17:43
The one's making them tend to use them...
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:17:00
They only take bitcoin online. I went to the stores that are listed, they're actually not Nola vape stores, they just sell juice to the stores.
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:50:52
the point is that he accepted it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:03:22
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:48:45
Late? Lol I hope your trolling. How long has Google wallet been around now? 3 years... Apple only just added Apple Pay
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:17:02
I bet it was, this is the only coffee I drink, I've tried others but they can't seem to get it right.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:16:22
I'd play, but it is not available in my state.
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:40:26
Anybody who is some what tech savvy can do this, but the point is to make it easier for everyone to get them.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:45:00
That is odd, was it cold brewed coffee?
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:49:54
I spend my BTC every chance I get, I have trouble hodling them I just end up buying more. Thank the lord for circle and coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:55:44
I second this
@_date: 2014-10-25 14:01:21
I'm still mining, I pay .04$ /kWh :)
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:40:36
Ally Bank refunds all ATM fees, even if it goes above 15$. I also use them to purchase BTC weekly, everything is smooth sailing.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:50:06
Isn't auroracoin scrypt? How could the bitcoin miners make it fork? Aren't they all asic's?
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:01:20
I will help if this really does happen, as long as it doesn't get in the way of my current job.
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:07:56
Not sure if they are still enforcing them still, but when they announced the csgo servers I couldn't play.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:18:05
True, but Visa is already robbing all of those children of their games through fees.
@_date: 2014-10-20 13:54:45
I use a copy of tails on a flash drive with my wallets on it. I also have 3 other flash drives with back-ups of each wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:10:05
no, but they could pass the tips on to other people if they don't really need that one dollar in BTC on change tip
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:49:57
I tipped a guy earlier in this thread he was very happy  
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:00:30
No, the value of BTC most likely changed after he placed the tip, so it says 4.99 not 5$
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:42:45
Thanks for the info 300 bits @_date: 2015-01-21 17:11:24

If you think about how our money is designed, it seems to me that we are already in a pretty bad pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2014-08-01 14:10:35
Awesome thanks for contributing, I will post an album with all kinds of pictures on Monday.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:54:44
Maybe say something along the lines of "I would like to request that you accept BTC as a form of payment. I believe acceptance will allow for a larger customer base, and more choices of payment services online."
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:41:45
Yeah I really hope people aren't stupid enough to send this guy their money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:57:46
Lol "spammers", there's no such thing, they are called users.
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:38:03
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:17:30
I'm sure he is referring to the fact that you have to convert it back to fiat in the end. Those conversions have fees.
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:39:58
It says Leetcoin is unavailable in my location. Is the U.S. blocked?

How many steam games could that buy? my guess is a lot if it is during a sale.

you're very right.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:22:55
Who is going to give a bitcoin exchange enough money to insure their customers when the keep getting hacked? What we need is a decentralized exchange not some group of asshats "insuring" our money. That's the point of Bitcoin the user doesn't have to have their money insured because all the security is on their end.
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:37:15
Just from reading the title of your post made me start thinking. I realized what you were going to say before I read it. I totally agree with you, I can see a future where Block chain tech transforms the world around us. Hopefully it will happen sooner then later.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:13:14
Wow, how many gyft points have you acquired over the past two years?
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:39:35
I'm sure it is pretty difficult to get insurance on a Bitcoin exchange.
