And Trump is president of the USA. Doesn't mean he isn't a cunt.  
  
By the way: If I'm the troll: Make a screenshot of your bitcoin account and hold a piece of paper with your username in front of it. But I guess you are too shy for that either, eh? You are just full of shit and you try every angle to scratch a few bucks together. You don't bullshit anyone. Sad.

Sure, delete this one and the one of your Alt as well. @_date: 2018-01-18 19:29:36
Sure, you both "rock the same shirt" and he is mod in the sub of your "company". Quit your bullshit.

Haha, such a bad liar, kinda amazing.  
  
BTW:  
"Do you want me to delete this?"  
-"Yes"  
"Fuck, ...... better run and ignore him."

Thanks for the screenshot, makes it easier to call you out on your shit next time. Have a nice day.

Sure kiddo. Hey, can I interest you in a WWE chair? :D
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:23:57
Yeah sure mate. Then simply snap a pic of the shirt on your bed/couch and upload it. I'll instantly paypal you $15 if you can do it in the next hour.  
  
BTW: How is your chair business going? The one you spam all over Reddit. Or did you switch to shirts now?

Looks like a cheap rip off of this shirt: **teezily.com/hodl-it**  
  
Also: Hey OP, how come when you are "rocking this shirt all day long", why don't you provide us with a picture? Because you don't actually own it and try to sell it like you sell all kinds of stuff?
