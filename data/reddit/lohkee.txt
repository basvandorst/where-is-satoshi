Any plans to add NyanCoin on ShapeShift.io? Been holding a few I'd like to convert and love using the service.

Doesn't matter, take the money and run!

Xapo is the only option I've seen so far. If you want to get started here's my referral link that scores me 50 bits. Thanks,

Thanks guys!

Hi there,
I didn't see any mention of ChangeTip in the article, should be a good mention for "How to I send people money via Bitcoin."
It would also be interesting to mention that BTC would be a great framework to create a Universial Basic Income (UBI).
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:42:27
Adding reputable people to your company doesn't mean crap if you are still overcharging with $15 monthly and *$0.60* withdraw/transfer fees. I'd rather have a usable service than a useless one with a bunch of buzz generators attached to it.

You should check out , they are handing out bits daily as a Universal Basic Income proof of concept. This would also be a good introduction to brainwallets.

I need to get back into bitcoin, commenting for a tip!
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:51:39
From what I've heard LibertyX is pretty good for this.

@_date: 2015-08-05 00:16:27
I registered but don't see anything from them in my inbox. Have a link?
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:49:52
Thanks for the BTC, will check it out when I make it home today.
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:18:34
I just set up my first weekly buys yesterday!
@_date: 2015-07-01 23:54:33
To the moon! So Shibe, much Wow.
If you own much more bitcoin than the giveaway then it would be in your interest to get more people using into using it to raise the overall price.
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:36:02
LibertyX and local bitcoins

Circle needs verified wire transfers but will give you instant access to $100 of your BTC when you buy. Without a credit card Coinbase makes you wait a week.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:20:19
You could be using cash and the Local Bitcoins site to buy BTC for your wallet or find a private trader and work a deal. Just because some site makes it a requirement for them it doesn't matter here. Bitcoin is the punk rock of money, it doesn't care if you are a person or a program as long as you can get Satoshis transferred to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:15:24
I started with a weekly buy and would also do larger chunks when I could. Stay with it and it will pay off. Research, research, research.
There is an entire alternative coin trading market that uses BTC as the entry. Check that out if you are look to diversify and hold other coins too or play the market.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:25:51
What service are you using for your daily buy? Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-04-25 15:42:51
I think I finally have all my bitcoin stuff set up, have any bits left?
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:54:02
It's not much, but been visiting faucets and donating to the Nepal effort!
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:51:27
What a great time to start back, thanks guys!
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:31:03
You can do either, move them to a real wallet or transfer to exchange. If you need help, send me a PM.

Just getting started with some satoshi faucets!
50 bits @_date: 2015-04-25 15:28:12
And only for big US banks.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:14:57
Circle has been the easiest choice to get market rate bitcoin within 1-3 days. Coin base was taking a week to clear and other instant services charge much higher fees.
