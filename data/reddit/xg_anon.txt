I consider myself pretty smart but I have no clue why the fed does what it does and what is the purpose of a lot of fiscal policy and even at the banking level it doesn’t really make sense.

On point 6, ever noticed in fancy restaurants they write something like
Chef salad — 15
Very plain and without the $, it’s because it’s been shown to create a dissonance with cost. When you read the plain numbers you don’t register a loss it’s just numbers and same with a portfolio, removing colors and dollar signs can help you to make a more informed decision without your brain lighting up with fear.

Just bought in at 17000. Pretty happy but it dropped a little more like minutes after.

Dang, some whales just made a killing. Did you see that dip? I’m an amateur so using my logic I figured the floor used to be 15000 before the surge and accounting for some actual growth I bought in at 17k fully expecting it to dip to 16k. But damn it got all the way into the 14000s. Oh well, caught the falling knife and walked away with all my fingers.

Cross out a zero and you’re basically me. Yeah I’m pretty happy with my buy in.

Yeah ... kids filed the lawsuit. Contradictions exist at nearly every level in crypto but let’s blame it on the lambo chasing kids.
