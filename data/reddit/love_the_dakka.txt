We are still doing some due-diligence on the regulations involved, and if we don't see any showstoppers we plan to start pretty soon, we will definitely reach out to bitcoin experts. How did you become interested in bitcoin?

We see a big gap between the people that would benefit most from Bitcoin and their ability to learn about it and use it successfully. With our backgrounds we think that we can bring value to them.

I like your writing style, demystifying a complex process for beginners, fantastic.

We need more simple explanations like this one for people to get their feet wet. We can get into more secure methods later.

dentonbros, please PM me, my business partner and I are looking at the possibility of starting a digital currency business in the Upstate of SC and would love to go with you to visit your state reps. We have been talking with the Secretary of State office and FinCEN and getting very encouraging answers.

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History and Common Sense pod-casts are excellent, he deals with important subjects sometimes not being touched anywhere else. I sent him some BTC love the other day, a buck a pod-casts (as he says) would keep his superb shows funded.

Good to know article outlet might be biased. I did not know anything about that news outfit.

I donate to Dan Carlin for his Hardcore History and other podcasts. He asks for "a buck a show", I send him more than that.
