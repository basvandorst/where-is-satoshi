I’m sure, you thinking otherwise?

The coin is worth whatever someone will pay or give you for it. The market cap figures nought into that.

Why would you need any particular price at 4 pm unless you have a commitment to buy or sell at that time?

So would you consider continuation of the scam to be better news? Do you think Madoff should still be in business as well?

I would argue the reverse—the buyers and sellers on the exchange who set the market price are trading arbitrarily-sized pieces of the pie. I think they’re far more concerned with what their pieces are worth than the value of the whole pie.

Hmm, I dunno. Maybe try Googling a website that has some kind of internet search capability?

It is generally true that a coin with a low last price and a low circulating supply has more profit potential. Mashing those two numbers together into a “market cap” only destroys information and is the wrong way to think about a coin. Market cap makes some sense in the context of an entity looking to acquire a publicly-traded company. No one would want to buy every coin of a currency for any sensible reason.

I️ think you’ve pretty much explained it yourself, haven’t you? What does it matter if it’s just a constant multiple of the last exchange price? Why not just look at the price?

It’s pretty obvious he’s talking about individual bitcoins themselves, not the concept. He’s not retarded.

In your example, smoke *is* proof of a fire. It’s more like a bunch of people running past you shouting “fire” without you actually seeing it there yet.

Redditors: “Use Google.”

Nah, let’s just cry about it and kill ourselves. No one ever lost $70,000 and made more back before and surely OP won’t be the first. And if he might be, having as positive an attitude as possible about the situation can’t help.

Christ, did anyone ever curate a Web index by hand? Had to see that would be a dead end career.

Do you know how any of this blockchain jazz works?

Not true, hodling raises prices.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:11
You’re missing the fact that a person who wants to immediately sell an additional bitcoin on the exchange would have to price that coin at 8800 or lower. Hodling decreases the total supply available at 8800 (or whatever the current exchange price is) or lower. Additionally, it’s also not correct that there’s no buyer in the entire world willing to pay $8,800 or more. That’s the exchange price, but people are free to negotiate their own trades at $1 per bitcoin, $10,000 per bitcoin, or whatever. Maybe there is someone out there who can’t get on an exchange and is willing to pay $10,000 if you go and get one for him/her.
