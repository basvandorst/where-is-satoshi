Bitcoin is so undervalued!
LN gives us a huge potential with low risk.

A organic growth would be way cooler

Well lighting is there. People are having lightning nodes for months. But it is in the Testphase. The price of Bitcoin is high, because when lightning will be success, it will have the strongest growth ever experienced. (My prediction)

The bottom one is not about deflation. It's just the growing demand/prices. Correct would be a bigger timeframe, but I like it anyway :)

Ah okay! So these are the fist (segwit2x) blocks, that are up to 2 mb?

Anyone can explain this in plain english ?

What about 1 Thaler = mBTC ? It represents a silver coin, like a gold coin represents a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:54:51
