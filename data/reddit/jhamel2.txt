Sadly yes. H\-Q was initially very positive towards Bitcoin mining until the actual socialist government sent his directive to shut it down. They tried the same tactic with Uber \(which failed horribly\).

There is a strong editorial angle in the documentary. Feels "Michael Moore\-ish" but the historical part is accurate and well done. Liked it.

One of the best rational voice for the industry out there. He's a CFA charter holder, gives a lot of credibility in the financial industry. A good post he wrote : [

This f***ng guy! :D

There is not a single week without major bank receiving a fine for some kind of malversation. Not a single one.

He's an anchor on Bloomberg TV.

I love when he explains how he got paid by wire transfer by the Bundesbank (German Federal Reserve, probably the world's soundest creditor) and his bank froze the transfer because they didn't know the depositor. LOL

On a legislative basis, Canada is a Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction. You're right about the banks though. I will adress it as well.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:07:45
Well, you're gonna have a bad time. I'll do the exact contrary.

There is not many business leaders out there advocating Bitcoin founding principles such as market-based consensus, decentralization and spontaneous order. The interview is relevant in the grand scheme of things. inb4 "meh political donations"
