Bcash is a Bitcoin Cash full node implementation, the hell are you talking bout?
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:22:39
Yes, BCore (as I will be calling it henceforth, just to annoy you) does currently have pretty low fees, since the network is not that congested anymore. But according to every page with BCore fees, they are not 1 cent. Usually above 15. Sure, sending a BCore tx with a 1 cent fee would probably work, but it would probably take some time to confirm. I mean, its not like the BCore mempool is empty right now... You know, there's a reason we upgraded to 32mb :)
Uhh, where were we at? 5 cent tx for Bitcoin Cash? just no wth  
I sent a quick test tx (via memo, woo social media on the blockchain), the fees were... 0.2 cents. Thats 25 times smaller than what you said.
So uhh, why are we trying to compete with litecoin? Are we? I thought we were competing with BCore. And like, every other crypto, apparently. Colored coins, CashShuffle, and more stuff.
Also, how are we a bank funded centralized ~scam coin~?  
I don't even know what you're talking about on the bank funded part, but we sure as hell arent centralized.  
Lets see: 2100 nodes, 2/3 on on Bitcoin ABC, and 1/3 on Bitcoin Unlimited (and like 60 nodes on other software haha), so just starting off there, we're a lot more decentralized on the node software part. I mean come on, you cant just have 94% run Core and call it decentralized. Atleast not when it comes to node software.
But what about actual people running the nodes?  
So according to bchnodes.online, 28% are in the US, 22% are in China, 10% in germany, and a whole lot more spread out accross the world. I mean hell, I even run one at home. It's not exactly expensive or hard, full 32mb blocks fill up a 2tb harddrive in about 400 days. And theyre like 50-ish bucks. (Fun fact: If someone living on 2$ a day can afford 0.125$ every day, they can buy a new harddrive every 400 days to run their Bitcoin Cash node on. Or you know, just prune blocks. I'd say having the latest 57600 blocks is pretty safe.)
And what are you talking about when you say scam? How is this a scam? Is someone gonna come and take my magic internet money away? Are they gonna somehow bruteforce my private key and go "haha xd get scammed"? The Large BCore Collider has found what, 15 keys? And apparently they're all part of some puzzle transaction.
SO. This is a really long comment.  
Tl;Dr: I disagree.
(Oh, and about that other comment. BCash is a node implementation. Not the name of Bitcoin Cash. Most exchanges, and most people, services, etc call it Bitcoin Cash. Only BCore peeps call it BCash.)
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:53:32
Well I personally think Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin is supposed to be, but just calling it Bitcoin *here* would confuse everybody. So instead I'm making a compromise and calling neither of them Bitcoin, and instead using Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core, and grabbing the Core part from the reference full node implementation.
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:29:21
Trust me, I've used the Core chain before. It certainly works, and since blocks aren't so crowded anymore a tx takes 10 minutes as expected, because of replace-by-fee. Neither are the fees insane anymore, but according to a google search for "bitcoin fees", they're currently 0.37$, which is a lot more than a cent or so.
And guess what, there's a cafe where I live that accepts both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core! So well. I went there. Bought a blueberry milkshake. (With Bitcoin Cash, obviously.) Was pretty good. Fees were 1 and a half cents. Tx took around 5 seconds total, since I didn't have to bother waiting for confirmations.
So, uh. Could you actually explain _why_ Bitcoin Cash tx are slower and more expensive than segwit tx? You forgot about that part.
e: spelling
e2: For the record, as of right now Bitcoin Cash fees are $0.0037. Interestingly enough, Core fees have gone down to $0.19. (Taken from txhighway. Bitcoinfees.info however reports $0.28 for Core, which I also used for the Core fees above.)

i dont get it
i thought we were trying to make bitcoin a usable currency?  
but now you're all "use fiat lol"
please explain
if volatility is an issue bitpay exists... they even have a pos solution, meaning you can buy your coffee with bitcoin.
so... why "get some fucking cents out of your pocket"? sarcasm??
@_date: 2018-08-23 05:11:53
Yeah, just wait about 18 months or so.
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:35:30
It's slower and more expensive? Explain yourself.  
For the record, most places accepting Bitcoin Cash take 0-conf, and 1-sat/byte fees work just fine.
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:03:59
What happens if you put, say dogecoin or litecoin?? Cuz im not testing it.

what is a "segwit ready" ver?
gonna set up a full node myself, dont want none of this bu crap
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:15:07
just set up a full node to support segwit!
(...i dont need to do anything to support segwit except use the latest wallet, right?)
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:57:38
...What im trying to say is that the government has the potential to force a closed source altcoin, not their own bitcoin fork.
Try reading the other replies to my comment.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:11:03
Mit allows you to change the license.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:32:46
Does that still apply if say, I create my thing outside, say the US, and then they decide to change the licence, can they do it?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:28:29
Good thing bitcoin is gpl'd, at leas-
Ah, fuck.
A closed source coin? Fun.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:09:04
Wait, so if you're offline you can't recieve payments unless you use a custodial wallet... as in, more-or-less a bank?

1) Sell bcc super cheaply  
2) Coin price goes down and bcc dies  
3) ???  
4) Profit
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:48:52
its even more relevant considering season 3 episode 2(?) comes out that day
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:39:49
if bch crashes (which probably is happening cause of all the dumping here) ima buy some.
...and then when it recovers sell it for btc :)
