The National Debt Clock is on 6th Avenue, the one pictured here is just an art installation and has nothing to do with debt. Common mistake.

It doesn't, but that wasn't the question. People will still short it - my point is that those short contracts will likely act as a hedge and mitigate some of the volatility we've been witnessing.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:21:25
It will bring diminished volatility. Can't short BTC like a single company stock.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:52:40
The mechanism could be set up "just like stocks" but it's not a stock, so it won't act like one.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:57:14
I was being honest. I am sorry to hurt your feelings. It's pretty clear that you are upset, and I'm sorry. Now, stop being a terrible hypocrite "manchild" yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:23:37
That ain't OWS either.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:58:22
Ah! So you are the "typical bitcoin investor" the government has been warning us all about!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:27:41
Marginally, sure, but the differences between stocks, currencies, and commodities are already well documented. There is nothing new in that statement.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:21
I was repeating your own words, which is my point... Are you ok?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:06:20
I told you to look something up after you asked a basic question that you can easily research yourself. Sue me.
You are being the thing that you are accusing me of now. What a sad way to go about this. Just stop.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:58:29
And yet it's useful for people like peanut, above. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:06:11
...like you?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:04
Can anyone explain why everything is not just fine? After a 30% decline, it looks stable to me. This has happened before and will happen again. If you buy and it falls, buy the dip until you are at parity with your losses (ish), diversify into 3 or 4 coins, and hold. Right? How has anything fundamentally changed?
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:23:03
OK, peanut.
Sorry to hurt your feelings. I just thought this was all kind of funny.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:57:31
Sure, if global markets collapse, bitcoin may collapse with them, but that's a far stretch to prove that point - additionally I'd say bitcoin would have just as much of a chance of rising under a circumstance where global markets and currencies start to collapse - just like gold would.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:49
You just slam your face into the pointy end. Easy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:16:54
That's literally what you said though... and is effectively your point.
But wait, then you step on your own toes: "Bitcoin is different than any other commodity, that is for sure," (and THEN you say)  "but it is not immune to supply and demand."
Yes? I'm not sure what you are really saying here. Do you just want to say common things like you are saying something profound? Of course supply and demand effects BTC. ???
I get that you want to differentiate your opinion from mine, but you are just parroting basic econ 101 stuff here. Sorry to be a dick, but this is getting silly.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:18:28
Agreed, now do some research and get back to me! Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:30
Not anymore!
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:33:04
There is no underlying physical asset at risk of crashing under value loss.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:25:35
And back down just as fast.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:22:48
Don't bring that ignorant shit either.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:21:47
You described yourself there. Not me. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:58:46
Those women are clearly just his nurses.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:11:48


[Let me point you in the right direction](
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:09:41
I'm not really sure what you are even saying, but ok. I agree that any market is at risk of a crash, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:51:46
Sure, good luck. lol.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:22:01
Woah, that's a lot of stinky poo.

The lower case I's with the random period confuses me too. Education is a good thing, Brandon.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:42:37
Oh shit, you found a way to get around it.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:26:21
Fickle, not fickled. Though fried fickles would be a good name for a bar food spin off.

The only people who will survive the collapse of the US dollar will be those who hold cryptos.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:57:03
How do I get my lost money back???
