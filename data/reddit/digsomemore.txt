Adding addresses here for reference later. Seems to refresh quite often so might be pointless.
EDIT: Too many to list. Gave up.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:53:26
I actually know all them.

What characteristics of Islamic banking do you feel appeals to the use of Bitcoin. Do you feel that Shariah compliant product needs/requirements will keep Bitcoin out of the picture?

Someone is trying to stop this bullish run with rumors.

Wall St has already been in bitcoin for awhile now and expect them to continue even more this year. Also expect the price of bitcoin to skyrocket as well.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:06:51
Paypal and Amazon. Stretching.
Newegg and TigerDirect. I see it.
ETF, yes, will be the Winklevii
$10k. Possible.
IRS. Most likely.

Very curious too, been on my mind for awhile.
Surprised my question is the only one he is not answering.
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:49:51
Most of these addresses have 20-30 transactions in them now, when i published 11 hours ago they had about 1. So I assume they use the same addresses over again once in awhile? There could be hundreds out there though.

Chinese banks were never out of the picture, complete opposite, China wants you to use their banks so they can track monetary flow. Just 3rd party vendors.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:28:48
Yeah I've tipped Tom Bitcoin as well, agreed!
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:51:08
Not likely with a subscription model. More likely with a freemium a la carte micropayment model.

Especially international traders who have no idea who seized property is handled in the US.

Bruce, with your strong understanding of middle east finance and opportunities, hoping you can help me understand these questions and your outlook for Bitcoin within the region.
What characteristics of Islamic banking do you feel appeals to the use of Bitcoin?
Do you feel that Shariah compliant product needs/requirements will keep Bitcoin out of the picture?

If there was a real problem we would have seen selling on OKCoin and BTCChina which hasn't taken place yet. China traders would be the first indicator before we hear something.
EDIT: Exchange displaying fine again. Only technical problem with API.

I recognize quite a few faces being flashed in the video, many are tech journalists or influencers.
EDIT: Just got word this was shot wednesday/thursday of last week.
EDIT: The following people I recognized. Ben Parr, Guy Kawasaki, Robert Scoble, Brian Solis, Shira Lazar, Randy Zuckerberg, Dave Peck, Wayne Sutton, Jeremiah Owyang, Brit Morin, Veronica Belmont, Sarah Austin, Jac Vanek

This may have been malicious intent considering it would appear his first tweet was only a week or so ago with a number of possible purchased/fake followers.
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:52:41
That was quick and easy. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2014-08-22 03:33:28
Strikingly positive.
"so software developers aren't going to have to be sitting around wondering if it applies to them - it doesn't, it applies to financial intermediaries."
Meaning no regs on non-hosted wallets, mining pools, multi-sig tech.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:35:39
Coinbase for sure. Don't forget 2FA.
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:54:14
Actually will also depend on market price that day. For all we know it could have skyrocketed or could have a major sell off. So lets just assume fair market price that day.
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:00:49
This guy's first tweet was 12/29/13...15k followers since then. Doubtful.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:41:10
Expected way more, author underwhelms with canned PR "movement" bullet points.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:12:55
We can only blame the Bitcoin community, ourselves, if anything goes wrong for not adapting or evolving the Bitcoin protocol to meet new challenges.
@_date: 2014-01-04 21:51:52
I am wondering if this Twitter account has been hacked as it seems to be the root of the rumor.

Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, tweeted the following:
"Excited to have Overstock accepting Bitcoin via  - marks the beginning of $1bn+ revenue mainstream merchants"

Yep, I guess all it takes is two parties who want to pay 5% under to market price to end up actually getting it at market price or a premium in an auction environment.
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:32:11
Here is the digital issue: 
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:23:11
Currently there are hedge funds looking to purchase bitcoin privately or through an auction. They cannot risk purchasing on the open market because they do not want to move the market and they do not have full provenance of where the bitcoins came from. Expect these guys to jump on the opportunity to buy this many bitcoin in an auction, possibly not even at a discount because of the value added from reduced risk and clear provenance.

I got "donation" copy for visit. Here are the two pages I saw that came up as a pop up when loading the home page.

Likewise, known Sean for awhile and he has always been an innovator and well connected. Kudos to him.

There is this tweet option on the "print for your records page" after checkout completion.
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:39:57
Is this part of the application process? Any where to look that up, very curious.

You can also show him this 2014 VC report for Bitcoin as well.

Will still be listed everywhere else though, not sure how that helps.

Awesome news, more competition!

This is a great episode with a ton of insight. I loved Ludwin discussing how the financial industry has become more open to blockchain tech in the past 3 months. Every large financial institution now has a Bitcoin strategy, and that we will see networks setup by 2016.

I also think that whoever designed this billboard did a terrible job. Crap job. Even the photos I took myself look shopped to me now that I look at them.
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:14:56
I don't know if a video will dispel doubters.
Here are two other images that I didn't upload of the same sign, uncropped. Not that it really helps.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:11:14
Would be interesting to see how much they have been sent lately. I heard who ever this is has multiple billboards in the city. This is the only one I have seen so far.

$1400 by 12/1/13

Domainer as well from 90's with similar perspective.
Also, I have been working on the idea that alternative coins will follow in line (power law theory) just like alternative tlds did. Bitcoin will still dominate but leave room for niche verticals/geography with altcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:19:34
Only you will really know your price average if that matters to you. Think of it more as gold and less as a share of stock. Your average btc price is $250 and you will sell it at xxx. Do you need to prepare your taxes or something?

I think it was like Robertson and Cadillac

Is it me or does he keep removing limit order and replacing limit order...like it is a game.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:06:47
I thought the same yesterday, until I saw it with my own eyes today. Really thought it was shopped from those fake accounts.

Huobi in China is rallying. Is it because of this news?

It's Christmas.
Most of the volume right now is in China on Huobi.

It already corrected close to $800 and bounced back yesterday. What is your point?
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:15:44
Yes 80-90%. Make sure you turn on 2 Factor Auth though.
