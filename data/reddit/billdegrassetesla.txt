You may be interested in the coin Monero then! Monero (XMR) is a fully anonymous cryptocurrency that uses ring signatures to mix every single transaction so that only you know a record of your transactions. I recommend checking out r/monero to find out more!

No, I don't. but let's be honest here. Law enforcement is getting a bit ridiculous. Grandma didn't ask the government for permission to carry cash and the government illegally seized it anyway.

I think the licensing is just for selling Bitcoin to another person.
