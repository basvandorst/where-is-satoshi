It's silly to even consider $1m/BTC as a possibility.  That would mean that bitcoin's market cap would be $21,000,000,000,000 or $21 trillion when all coins are mined.  There is only $1.39 trillion USD in circulation.

Just because Apple has a large customer base does not mean they are all potential customers for giftcards on pock.io.  That's like saying America has 300 some million people, so this American flag company started in a garage has 300 million potential customers.

Why would they offer a discount for payment in a less liquid and far more volatile asset?  From a business perspective, there's no incentive to discount it

Having a commodity unregulated doesn't mean it makes fraud legal.  There's no central bank for gold, but passing off a gilded lead ingot for one of gold sure as shit is going to land you some hard time.

Because it's far too volatile for a retirement account.  You invest what you plan to live off of till the end of your life in something secure and interest bearing, not something that can crash to a third of the value you bought in at in a month.

My company accepts both credit card and bitcoin.  We accept bitcoin because we believe in its future, not in attempts to save money.  In actuality, the bitcoin we receive when an order is placed is immediately converted to USD to avoid worrying about the price volatility.  As I'm sure you're aware, exchanges charge a fee for this, as well as fees for withdrawing funds to a US bank account.  It took man hours to code the site to handle the new payment method, and to automate the conversion progress.  We have certainly not made money by accepting bitcoin, but that was never the goal.  Offering a discount, at least from my perspective, is economically inefficient.

As a finance major and economics minor, I'm very aware how the economic system works.  While the bitcoin movement is wonderful for anonymous transactions online, you're naive to think a government sponsored fiat currency will not be the primary medium of exchange and value store in our lifetime.

And if it declines more, then you can't afford to retire and have to work in your golden years.  There's two sides to the coin, it's too risky an investment for a retirement fund.

The point of the service is convenience, though, not frugality.  Having one number to text to get literally any task accomplished for you could be well worth the premium to some.  It's essentially outsourcing a personal assistant.
