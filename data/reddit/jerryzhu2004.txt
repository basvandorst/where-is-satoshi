But wouldn’t they know it wasn’t the real thing? And I don’t think they’d kill you or let you go yet, they would just keep making you go through the torture until you said the real key.

If they know you have a worth-to-abduct-you-to-steal quantity of bitcoin I’d assume they know the approximate amount and they wouldn’t be happy with just 1/10

Or the US government (or really any government or person) could torture you until you said your 12 word password. The convenience and “security” also means that you are now your bitcoins - if someone gets ahold of you, they get ahold of all your money.

You seem quite optimistic. Have you got a source for that though?

It’s not really the case. China has actually been overvaluing their currency in the past, but what happened is that due to Trump’s threats about more tariffs, the governments efforts were likely overwhelmed by people who were selling the Yuan in panic. The cause of the drop of the Yuan is likely not based in China, but as a result of Trump’s own actions.

I think it’s going to get replaced as in another crypto becomes more powerful, but that’s just a guess

I have to say I agree. The market is basically a really volatile stock which is controlled by pumping and dumping. Honestly bitcoin is a mess in its current state.

Problem is most people didn’t get in at $50.

I’m got into bitcoin a bit around June in 2017, and I asked my father for investment advice. He guided me to a 20% profit which I was happy with. Then came the December peak, and about a month before that he told me to sell because he thought bitcoin was a bit dodgy. I sold and wasn’t happy because it rose a lot after that, but when it crashed I realized the true volatility of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin isn’t an investment; it’s a gamble.

Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:27:00
OK, but I don’t see an explanation from you either.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:07:05
I would call a stock that literally loses 80% of its value in a year worthless. 
Bitcoin is designed to be a currency but it isn’t used as one. That’s the problem.

How you gonna spend bitcoin in prison? If you have a large amount, how are you going to survive torture?
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:10:18
I dunno who’s the seal here. A person who’s giving a reasonable explanation, or a person who’s insulting others with no supporting explanation when questioned. I’d say the you are the seal.

Making people only save instead of spend is a bad thing. It destroys the economy because nobody wants to buy anything. And how is this related to casinos?

Works as well with determined thieves.

Wouldn’t a deflationary currency will encourage hoarding of the currency, causing lower economic activity and therefore kill the economy?
