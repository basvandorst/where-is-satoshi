I don't think that would help in my case. Isn't that a retirement fund? Also how would it save me from paying taxes on the sum I'm planning on putting in?

Well that *does* sound better. Thanks again for the good advice!
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:16:01
God I really hope so!

Thanks for the advice. The property is fully paid for. By my estimation it worth around 100-150k but in dire need of a renovation before selling or renting it. I speak the language fluently however the last time I've visited was about a decade ago and I'm not very familiar with realtor or management companies in the country so I would be kind of scared to try and rent it while I'm living thousands of miles away. Who do I trust? How do I get the rent? What if something happens to me and my wife and kids doesn't even speak the language or have ever visited the country, how would they claim their inheritance? How would I pay taxes for the income (here in the US or there)? It seems easier to sell and invest here in the US. Index funds, bonds, real estate... something that I can easily pass on to my children.

Haha. Thanks for the tip.

Ah I see your point. Absolutely right. The crypto part is not really for investment more like a convenient way to transfer and exchange currencies.

So basically after paying taxes on it in a foreign country THEN AGAIN here in the US will make it legal right. But what will I have left to start the fund with after the double taxation? :(

But since the real estate is in a different country why would I have to pay real estate tax on it here in the US?
As far as the IRS concerned I always had this money, maybe it's cash I had buried in Hungary since I was a kid. The real estate and the sale (anything to do with it takes place in a foreign country doesn't involve the US at all.

All of you saying talk to a pro so my question is who would be that "Pro"? A lawyer specializing in international law? Family law? Financial law? I'm clueless.

I feel that you absolutely right it's just disheartening to think about losing that much money to taxes when this property was bought with money they already taxed nearly 30 years ago and now both countries looking to take their piece out of it again. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:10:26
WHAT! Really?! That's great news!!! Are you 100% sure?
Thank you btw. I'm just really excited about it. Lol

Okay okay... it's Hungary ����

It's basically a real estate that was purchased by my parents over twenty years ago in my name with the clause that they are to live in it as long as they may. My mom passed many years ago and my stepdad is getting old and his health is not the best. So if the inevitable happens I'll have to go there and sell the real estate, pay the local taxes and bring the money back with me to the US. That is why I need a cost effective way to exchange and transfer the money.

Yes I start to realize that. I only been into cryptos for the last month/month and a half but the more I look into it the more I realize that it could be easily a bubble. Not the blockchain technology but the crypto fever.

Won't a **good** CPA take whatever he/she saves me on taxes?
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:57:32
So if I purchase cryptos with my money on an exchange or other place while in Europe and send it to a wallet then pull it out at a later time when I'm back in the US would that be against some laws just because the change in my physical location?
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:33:57
Thanks I'll look into it.

I don't wanna name the country but when you sell a real estate not to purchase another one you have to pay taxes.
