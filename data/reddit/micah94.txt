Apparently just non-US customers?  I don't see any messages in my account dashboard and haven't received any notifications.

Apparently you need someone that doesn't work for the company to take the name in order to get your bitcoin app on the app store.

Damn. They could have saved the postage and just sent you some bitcoin. You'll only get pennies anyway.

This was totally amateurish of Coinbase.  Imagine Chase Bank blessing some developer's app that allowed you to send money to your friends.  Hey, it's cool...  Jamie Dimon and this programmer were roommates in college.  Are we going to take Bitcoin seriously or not, people?  C'mon.

If this is/was your personal account that's been quiet for years and suddenly you start running thousands of dollars through it above normal, they can shut you down.  You need to set up a new business account.  Call yourself a trading company, a pawnshop, whatever.  Clearly you're doing business.  Otherwise they'll just think you're a drug dealer.

Thanks for this.  I got down to 1:30 seconds.  I made a Newegg purchase and almost flipped my shit when I saw that Bitpay URL.  I had no idea they had switched to that.  Dunno if I want to use Newegg again after this...

Since Dwolla broke away from crypto-currencies, I'm not sure what your recourse is...  With all the money flowing into BTC right now, they are definitely missing out.  Sorry, I don't have an answer to this...  Not sure what the next step is..
