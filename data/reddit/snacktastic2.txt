It's toast.  I'm sure the us gov is trying to seize the funds as we speak or they possibly already have.  Even if they're successful since most deposits there are anonymous there's basically no way for the gov to be able to return the coins.  Not that they would anyway even if you could prove that you personally weren't doing anything illegal.
The other scenario is that the criminals running the service that haven't been caught yet are frantically trying to move the coins right now and you can be damn sure they have no intention of giving any of your coins back to you.

yes they accepted US customers with fake and/or no documentation.  You can be sure that the investigators created undercover accounts to see what was possible on the platform.  That's likely one of the ways that they discovered BTC-e's claims of compliance with KYC/AML laws was actually not true.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:04:32
The DOJ's indictment says they were in USA.  And if it was actually the FBI that seized the servers, as BTC-e social media claims, and not Interpol or some other country's police force on behalf of the FBI, then I'm going to believe that they probably were.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:48:54
Did you read a single thing I wrote in this post?  All of their shit was hosted in the USA.  These morons at BTC-e actually ran almost their entire operation with USA companies.  Google, CloudFlare, etc.

the btce admins are not going to try to reopen as a "rogue" exchange just so that they can give you your money back.

The vulnerability that allowed gox to get hacked could have been discovered before btce was launched.  If that was the case then at that time there were no other viable exchanges to wash the stolen coins through.  It's possible they decided to launch btce as a "front" exchange to move the coins they stole.
So fast forward a little and now they have a real exchange with plausible deniability, do the hack (slowly), and wash the coins through btce.  Btc-e had low fees because they were dealing in stolen coins.
So it's entirely possible the whole operation was a long con to hide the stolen coins from gox.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:58:31

This investigation has been ongoing for at least more than a year.  The indictment was from January 2017.  But that was only when the charges were formalized.  It's likely the servers that were hosted in New Jersey were covertly monitored, and probably imaged, without the knowledge of BTC-e admins.  This would have allowed the FBI to do their forensic investigation offline to discover evidence to build a case which has now ultimately led to the unsealing of the indictment and arrest of Vinnik.
Just because they were only recently formally seized doesn't mean they didn't have access to them before now.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:35:52
I'm not making anything up.  Vinnick sent hundreds of millions of dollars from stolen gox wallets to btce-owned (not customer) wallets.  Vinnick was an admin at btce.  Vinnick was a partner owner of btce's owning company.  That means vinnick was one of the owners of btce.
He personally stole money from gox users and sent it to his front company in order to wash it and resell it.

The indictment claims they also hosted their servers in the US.  Given the above three verifiable points, I'm going to go ahead and guess that the DOJ's claims about the servers is also true.

all the large mining pools operate from well-known blocks of IPv4 addresses, which could easily be blocked wholesale by ISPs or Great Firewalls.  Maybe they could get like a billion IPv6 addresses?  But those still have to be allocated, so it's not like they can't be blocked as well.

more or less the same thing I think.  He's alleged to have sent coins from stolen Gox wallets to a number of wallets owned by himself, and also internal BTC-e wallets.

How did the scammers get your email address?  Did BTC-e lose their customer database?  Are the scammers actually from BTC-e?

If I lose $200k coins from Coinbas by illicit means then I am insured to receive the entire amount of those coins.

They'll probably set up a program where you can try to claim your coins if you can prove they were acquired legally.  This is what the did with Liberty Reserve

[Coinbase's response to the fork](
tl;dr: they have no intention of supporting the fork.
edit: and unlike basically every other coin exchange in the world, Coinbase actually adheres to, and presumably goes to great lengths to make sure their operation is legal and secure.
I'm leaving my coins in Coinbase through the fork because, as an American, I know that the value of my deposit is insured by real banks with real money.
If this whole crazy thing on August 1st goes apeshit, I know that I at least have legal standing to recover my money.

you're delusional.  either the FBI has the coins or the remaining btc-e guys will run away with them.  why do you think they have any interest in giving you back your money?

Every country in the world worth a shit has equivalent kyc/aml laws.  This isn't just a matter of denying us customers

USA goes after anyone that fucks USA or USA citizens.  Wherever they are in the world.

They broke a shit ton of laws in basically every country in the world, got busted, now they're on the run with everyone's money.  They're not giving it back
