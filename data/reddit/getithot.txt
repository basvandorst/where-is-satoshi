**The fear of Bitcoin overtaking Yuan**
China has digitized its financial sector faster than any other nation. Authorities continue to support the trend, though their public comments also suggest concern bitcoin could weaken official control of the country’s money supply.
The crackdown on the bitcoin ecosystem represents Beijing’s possibly biggest effort so far to limit expansion of a system to rival the yuan. In a previous crackdown, in 2009, the central bank banned the use of tokens valued at billions of dollars created in China’s massive online-gaming networks for real-world purchases.
A goal of China’s monetary regulation is to ensure that “the source and destination of every piece of money can be tracked,” Li Lihui, a NIFA official told a technology conference in Shanghai on Friday.
**Governments can’t regulate actual Bitcoin but can reach deep into many Bitcoin aspects**
Industry advocates hail bitcoin for allowing users to transact with each other without the involvement of a central authority. In reality, users access the market for virtual currencies via services and businesses that are centralized in real locations and therefore are susceptible to third parties. Any attempt by China to interfere broadly in the bitcoin network would test that notion further.
**It’s not just trading, mining in China could be impacted**
Until now, Chinese miners considered themselves immune from Beijing’s evolving stance on bitcoin trading. One entrepreneur said miners are now worried about authorities moving to limit their operations. “Using VPNs as a workaround will be difficult,” he said, referring to virtual private networks that allow users to circumvent China’s so-called Great Firewall.
Chinese miners loom large in the global bitcoin mining network, also serving an important role in the upkeep of the bitcoin ledger. Potential interference in how they connect to and use the internet could disrupt, at least temporarily, both the creation of new bitcoin and the speed at which global bitcoin transactions are confirmed, say people in the industry.
