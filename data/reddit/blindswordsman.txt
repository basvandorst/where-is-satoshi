This is absolutely amazing, saving for later

Best you can do is mine altcoins and trade for BTC

I think what would be lovely to see is adoption of bitcoin over the world in terms of infrastructure. We could have some sort of a map type thing or even just like pictures from the site where bitcoins are being accepted, PM me!

It can most likely be turned into a webservice, PM me and let's talk about it!

They are around 60$ a piece, I wanted to see what I could do with one of them but turns out unless I have significant hashing power, from the profitibility calculator, I won't break even. Actually it seems that buying BTC directly for USD might be a much better idea as then I can trade/sell and such later on and make a little bit of profit on my investment. 
But I totally agree, the asic miners are an amazing tool for learning more

I think the oil analogy is the key here, the value comes from infrastructure that backs it up.

thanks mate, it's actually the folks here who posted warnings and such about it leading me to the right direction
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:11:08
Actually I just found out about the profitability calculator, plugged the numbers in and it's a terrible terrible idea. Thank you so much for your help!

OP just PM'd you!

I think Satoshi said that as people lose their coins, the value of the coins goes up for others, i'm sorry to hear that though

Why all the hate? You post things like "you're such a hater" [1] and then do it here yourself. Also it's funny you say the following: 
"I think you're missing my point. It's one thing to oppose BTC and make a post saying you don't like it...but you're entire Reddit career is about opposing BTC....for months if not years. If you don't like it just leave. I can only assume you are paid to stay and spread negativity. I don't like monarchism but I don't go on the monarchist subreddit every single day stating the downfall of monarchism for years on end..." I can say the same for you about dogecoin.

Hey guys,
Seriously amazing job here. I've been trying to work on something very similar to this to prevent what happened at MIT where the state demanded the bitcoin-miner [1] 
This is what I wrote to give you guys an idea [2] maybe we can collaborate on the legal guide moving forward to also include how the software created around bitcoin protocols in hackathons can be made under a license or guidelines where the developers don't end up going to court and all that crap

I am currently working on a project to help make research more transparent, and make it easy to publish negative data - If you are interested please pm me, cheers!

Really looking forward to when you guys open source this!
