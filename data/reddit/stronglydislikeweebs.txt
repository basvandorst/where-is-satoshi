Who else is excited for the used market being flooded with cheap GTX 1080 Ti's?

If the ETH market crashes(which it is), miners will sell off all of their equipment for well below MSRP. The equipment that is commonly used the GTX 1080 Ti. Some people have rooms full of them

That's very nice, thank you. On the bright side, 99% of people don't own Bitcoin/know what it is, so to 99% of people the value of Bitcoin is $0. Currency is only valuable because society/the government believes it's valuable. If the vast majority of people don't think it's valuable, then it is not valuable at all. Am I correct in my reasoning?

Trolling? I was being totally serious about the message, I think you're completely crazy if you think such a volatile "currency" will ever be considered valid by most businesses
