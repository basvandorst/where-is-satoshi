Bitcoin will not put an end to the banks. There will be
Always the necessity for a caveau, or the necessity for a loan, whatever the currency. There will always someone who prefer fiat instead crypto, there will always be someone who have not the maturity to own a private key. The banks will never die, probably they will change. So, for me, put all banks of fire because crypto is the new fiat, is a bit immature.

OP, the synchronization will slow down when reaching the more recent (last 2 years) block

Nice job helping the network 
@_date: 2019-03-10 17:22:48
So... this is a way to keep your full node in sync with the other by listening the state of the blockchain from the blockstream satellites. But is not a way to send back information through. To do that, you still need an internet connection to propagate information to other node. Am i right?
Also, does exist a lag in the blockstream signal, or is it in true real time?
And, does LN expose your location too?

...your choices
@_date: 2019-03-11 01:56:30
..i've assumes that blockstream would broadcast the legitimate blockchain. Maybe does, maybe not. Sound good, but ctually, is pretty bad to centralize this kind of information...
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:02:46
To hijack a network through ISP you have to control all the isp. To hijack a network connected to this kind of satellite, you need to control just one satellite. Kinda easier no? Blockstream is acting as a man-in-the-middle, therefore compromising the security of the network. Full nodes instead are connected each other through a p2p network, making it more decentralised and harder to censor/taking down. That's also why people shouldn't use a cloud server (like amazon services) to run a full node. What you are making by connecting your internet connected full node to that dish, is to control that blockstream is actually streaming the correct blockchain. And from this point of view, that admirable.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:51:02
........what if blockstream start streaming something wrong?

Buy high sell low!
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:17:13
I would say, is better to buy at 10 and sell at 100, than rebuy at 30 and resell at 200.... Than buy at 30 and sell at 200.... Hodlers too should ride the fluctuation, take home the gains and then restart over again. For me, being an hodlers mean to "have bitcoin", not to "don't sell" it.
Anyway, i'm sure that even the strongest and more convinced hodler has sold some btc at ATH. no one could resist. And this mean that those ppl have eaten not the whole marshmallows but just a tiny bit of it.
Just my thoughts.......

So, ppl paying a lot believing in faster transaction... Are fool? xD
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:14:40
I was wondering why my transaction was taking so long, so I throw an eye at the mempool, and at block 558282 the mem pool was growing soo much, and miner took almost an hour to produce one. Then, in the next 6 minutes after 558282 the mempool has been rushed and emptied by like... 85% within 3 block, in 6 minutes! Why?! Shouldn't a block be produced statistically every 10 minutes?
Sorry for bad English :c

Thank you all for the answers &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:27:37
Thanks good luck to you too!
Speaking of fee actually is more convenient, I'll immediately sell il for fiat to protect me from volatility, maybe i can sell it at a slightly better price and have some more money! I am currently using coinbase, because gave me the impression to be the most solid exchange in term of security and volume (am i wrong? Suggestion accepted!) and with just one account i can accept 4 of the most Capitalized and raliable coin (bcash aside XD)

As i said, i love all of this. But, if somebody is used to access the internet for free, in exchange for some ads, it will continue to be like this. Sorry to say that.
I say like this because of the voluntary nature of this kind of things, if i want to support someone's cause, I'll do a donation - wikipedia foundation, patreon, twitch gold... -. Instead, if you choose i have to pay 1 cent for read that article, that i must pay for something that was used to get for "free" is not voluntary anymore, sound like extortion, and you, site, platform or whatever, are reminding this every like, every post, every comment like this one, i do on the internet. It will not work for the 95%of the people. It wil not work in the long run. :c

Sure. But in the first place, who moved all that money at once? Is easyer to think that just one rich person / bot moved all that money, than a couple of hundred/thousand normal people that "casually" bought bitcoin at the exact same time.
Is not even a news that moved the price cous historically  bitcoin doesn't follow news so much. Happen that the price skyrocketed after a ban news or dipped after a good tweet. What is moving the price right now is FOMO and massive speculation. Just my thoughts, sorry for bad english...

Is this the future of internet? Pay to continue reading buttons, pay to comment , pay to like, pay to post, everywhere? Is this the solution to aggressive advertising and user profiling, letting the interactions to pay for the site's infrastructure instead of ads company? 
Is this the perfect way to support who post quality content, giving users the tool for earning money in a digital meritocracy?
Or, will it become the new way for clickbait to proliferate?
Who know..
I love blockchain technology, and i support this revolution, but i fear something bad could arise.
