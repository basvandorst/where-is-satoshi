Nice venture. I'm a fellow Bitcoiner that is part of a Bitcoin ATM network. I have family in Aruba and as such had considered placing a bitcoin ATM in Aruba. We should touch base.

It depends, How would you like to do the trade. How many coins are you looking to buy? When do you need them? I usually do instant transfer. Would you like to use an escrow service? Ect?

I have purchased more than 25k in btc fin coinbase. How can you confirm that information. Is coin setter saying that if you transfer your funds to Coinsetter, they will refund you the 1% fee  you paid to Coinbase to have access to your coins?

I have been on Mycelium, using both the App as a wallet and as a trading marketplace. How have you found it. I have been using it for months and am a bit surprised by the lack of volume on the trading section of the app, considering how great of a wallet it is and the It's recent introduction to the app store.

Yes, I have made many trades on Mycelium. I have had many accounts with them and their were a few small bus along the way. They have seemingly worked them all out. It should be noted that I am trading in New York City on Mycelium so there are more people around me. With that said I still get very few sales on Mycelium. I get most of me volume from LocalBTC. It is a shame because I believe Mycelium to be a much better Platform.

I have been using BitQuick for a couple months. I actually often sell on there. They have gotten better every month and the most recent interface is very user friendly for buyers. As a seller who has put up to 5k on their site, I can attest to their trust worthy ness.
