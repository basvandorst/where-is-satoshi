That's kind of a silly argument; You can say that about any one single thing they might or might not be doing i.e. 'oh no they arn't doing that because there are all these other things they could be doing'. 
Anyway I'm trying to understand how easy it would be to do what I'm suggesting they have the ability to do and whether there' anything that stands in their way; Not here to discuss your alternative theories of how they could be profiting. Have a good day.

Actually, pretty much every site talks about their 'active users' not people who've ever created an account. Twitter for example just announced they had 240 million active monthly users. That's the number people care about since it represents the health and utility of a service. You will never see Twitter tout the 650 million accounts that have ever been created. An account is useless if it isn't used.

Again you're assuming they are maintaining the arbitrage opp explicity to exploit it in which case yes it would be illegal except from all accounts this is because of banking issues.

I like how in your last sentence you make it sound like this is your 20th attempt to explain this to me when in reality you've attempted to 'explain' it to me zero times. Your first attempt was a one line question and the second while not a question was as useless a one liner as the first.
What you're describing is cooking the books which is not only crooked but illegal. Exploiting arbitrage is not and could continue in perpetuity as a source of income and not impeded by people withdrawing or depositing or anything else going on in the universe for that matter.
Do you understand that, dude?

Saying, oh well you can money launder in other ways and so we should let it happen here also is not really going to score you very many points in an argument. Bitcoin in it's current form leads to untraceable transactions. This is a fact. It happens in cash also but again this is not a valid argument.  Saying the blockchain is public is also not a valid argument because going to the blockchain and saying 1F33wir3S7AM5gJCHb5t8Q5GaGMDSw46G8 sent money to 1F33wir3S7AM5gJCHb5t8Q5GaGMDSw46G9 doesn't give me a whole lot of information.

I might be totally off base with this but I highly doubt Karpeles stole your coins so if MtGox really is insolvent it's because the coins got stolen and/or because of the funds that were seized. Regardless, forget about your coins.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:16:09
I understand exactly how it works.
First of all FATCA isn't signed by countries. It's imposed on Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) and those that don't adhere to it have a 30% 'transaction fee' imposed on them on any transaction that passes through the US (which happens to be most of the ones in the world).
I'll repeat, bitcoin doesn't make it 'obsolete'. It allows for it to be evaded which is an entirely different story.

Yes let me clarify: By banning 'it', I should have been clearer: Banning use of bitcoin which means to say that if any bank, supermarket, website, car dealer, pimp, laundromat, bagel maker, taxi driver etc. were to be found to be using bitcoin, they would be breaking the law. 
You say millions will continue to use it. Continue to use it for what? Besides speculation and, in a former life, all sorts of illicit activity on Silk Road, what exactly can you point to as uses of it right now. And right now usage of it is not even banned. In the scenario it gets banned, it only gets worse. 
Please don't draw a parallel between buying drugs and buying bitcoin. People buy drugs and risk going to jail because they can't fight their addictions. You honestly think there will be people who will break the law to buy bitcoin? Millions and millions of these people? For what exactly?
Anyone who thinks, in this case OP, that government approval of bitcoin isn't a necessity for it to have any sort of acceptance and utility in the world is just deluding themselves.

Incredibly simplistic view.
If the government attempts to bans bitcoin by banning exchanges in it's vicinity, makes it illegal for banks to work with exchanges, makes it illegal for businesses to accept bitcoin and makes it a crime to advertise that you even accept bitcoin, do you really think any more than a fringe 0.00001% of the population will just ignore that and use bitcoin anyway?

@_date: 2014-03-23 04:51:43
Umm, yeah I understand. My point is that realistically you can only replace half of them unless you have infinite money because of wild price fluctuations between consequent transactions. Basically what I was saying before except with more realistic numbers i.e. you buy 10 now, in 1 month the price goes up 10% and so you only have resources/risk tolerance to buy 9 now when you spend the 10 and so on and so forth.

The numbers I gave were extreme just to make the point very clear but the same applies in any case where the price is significantly different than when you first bought the coins. 
Even in the very realistic scenario of buying at $250 and assuming a current price of $500, assuming your net worth has changed significantly in the last year and you are willing to put the same percentage of your net worth into bitcoins as a year ago, you can only realistically buy half the number of bitcoins that you sold.

If I and thousands of others are intrigued by who Satoshi really is, let us freaking be and lay off the exposes about why we should not be interested in this.

I'm pointing out the ratio to show how absurd it is for the article to claim that the majority want to be paid in bitcoin when only 2% of the people who were polled actually said they wanted to be paid in bitcoin.

'Out of 847 responses to a questionnaire sent to Tech in Motion's 18,000 members'
Funny what you can do with stats.
4% of the people polled actually bothered responding out of which half wanted to be paid in bitcoin. So essentially 2% of the people polled. Yup, sure looks like a majority to me. To the moon!
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:48:11
The most likely explanation is that majority of people don't share your understanding of the 'true value' of bitcoin and are actually just speculators trying to make a profit so when they see another example of bitcoin shadiness they fear a price drop and get out ASAP ?
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:20:35
Laundering bitcoins is infinitely easier than laundering cash. Suppose I gave you a briefcase of dirty money. It would significant effort, risk, connections and expertise to launder that which is absolutely not the case with laundering bitcion. I can sit down and create a thousand different addresses. Send money back and forth, route them through exchanges and tumblers while sitting in the bathroom. It's going to be virtually impossible for anybody to trace it back to me by the time I'm done taking a dump.
And on a practical level,, love it or hate it, cash is how we do the majority of our transactions. It's how we buy milk and sell gas and pay for weed. Banning it will lead to the collapse of, well a million different things including buying milk or selling gas. Banning bitcoin now affects absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing.

First of all, Keith was at no point in his life an 'engineer' at any company. He was Biz Dev at PayPal and the COO at Square.
Secondly, he's actually a well-known Libertarian and buddies with Peter Thiel.
Thirdly, he makes some very valid points. Talks about how bitcoin actually is a great technology but has no chance of succeeding int he US because of regulations. He would know; He's been in this space his whole life.
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:04:26
Haha. This is hilarious. As somebody who spent a few years in Switzerland let me tell you what actually happened.
Switzerland was faced with some of the highest HIV infection rates in Europe in the late 80s so they decided to hand out free (clean) needles to addicts as a temporary measure to fix that. Once that was brought under control they started heroin assistance therapy to lessen the crime rate and this model was based on something the British tried as early as the 1920s.

My key takeaway from this is he's probably paid too much by Overstock if he has millions to spend on bitcoin considering how his company's stock nosedived yesterday.

So basically you are saying it could be worth anything at all. Thanks for the expose.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:32:24
Bitcoin is great, yes.
At the same, the vast majority of this people that you speak off who don't have access to banking are at levels of poverty where having access to bitcoin is the last thing on their 'list of things I really want' list. And having access to bitcoin will not change their lives in any way. They are too poor.

Do you know what a bubble is?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:43:18
The opposite. One of the reasons the US wasn't moving in the direction of banning it was they didn't want it to boom in China and get left behind. This hugely incentivizes the US to follow suit since that is no longer a concern.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:27:27
What's left for BTC-China to do but shut down when you can no longer deposit money there and can't withdraw after Jan 31?
This is a death blow for them and I imagine they are just letting them stay around so that people can liquidate their holdings which is exactly what they are doing right now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:37:54
It is not possible to deposit or withdraw money on BTC China directly using banks (not new; this was always disallowed by the government). 
Therefore people had to use third party payment processors. In the latest news, these processors were told to stop dealings with BTC China.
In short it is now impossible to put money on BTC China to buy any bitcion and after Jan 31 it will not be possible to withdraw money from BTC China. 
Yes I'm sure you can still send BTC to your account on BTC China and send out but I don't see BTC China continuing sticking around for just enabling this.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:29:55
I think the pull request you are referring to is a change to relay double spends rather than simply dropping them. That doesn't solve the problem you get with control of the network where you can push through these double spends with increasing ease.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:11:18
Yes, i"m not saying it's trivial.
I'm also not talking about a couple of guys in the basement trying to pull this off. I'm talking about potentially a nation state or a multi-billion dollar company setting out to make these. They would certainly be able to design and mass produce anything 'Butterfly Labs' is capable of making.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:18:33
Probably not at Christmas. I imagine they'll want to liquidate the stash they recovered from Silk Road first!
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:21:38
Well they can't really shut down exchanges that are not in China such as the ones you mentioned. 
They also don't want to screw over the millions of Chinese that have bitcoin; Hence the deadline till Jan 31 for people to basically exchange all their coin for FIAT and BTC China to close up shop.
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:06:18

Let's suppose the rogue element orchestrating this attack has more than enough hardware on standby to compete with all the mining pools put together.
Wouldn't news of this attack have a dramatic affect on the value of bitcoin? Wouldn't this cause panic selling and a possible crash and huge disincentive to continue mining?
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:49:21
Somehow I don't see this person, who sends cash in an envelope, being the type of person who's going to ever use bitcoins in this lifetime.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:40:18
You're entirely missing my entire point. It's not that these people don't have a convenient mode of payment available to them; they don't have anything to pay with. Doesn't matter what currency you are using when you have zero of it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:29:33
You hate banks because your mom made bad decisions? 
Are you suggesting she wouldn't have made these bad decisions if she was getting paid in bitcions? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:39:16
Depends entirely on what your intention is. If you are Western Union, Mastercard or Visa or any number of financial institutions whose existence is potentially threatened by widespread adoption of bitcoin, than I'd be trying to collapse bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:02:19
There is no doubt the more immediate message will be 'Bitcoin network compromised. Sell Sell Sell'.
What if this attack was initiated by people with lots of money who obtain massive short positions on bitcoin that will profit immensely on every dollar the price goes down by?
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:22:15
You want me to reread something *you* wrote as evidence for supporting *your* claim? Ha! Very nice.
I'm at a complete loss to understand how you continue to think it's possible to deposit money on BTC China via the 'vendor's back account' despite every news agency reporting it's no longer possible and Bobby Lee himself saying you can no longer deposit money on BTC China.
I'll ask one more time: Show me how to send money to my account in BTC China. If you can't do that, please stop trolling.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:52:25
Go read that article and you'll see there is no 'thinking' involved; It's written right there: No deposits. 
Can you actually point me to an article or give me a list of steps as to how I can get money on BTC China to buy bitcion? Thanks. Looking forward to that so I can stop spreading my FUD.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:05:55
Would be interested in hearing potentially what these changes are and why are they not already built into the network since I think if something like this were ever attempted, it would be absolutely catastrophic.

Brilliant analysis. I think this deeply insightful statement was what the world was waiting for before rushing to widespread bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:49:57
Right but I'm talking about the scenario where some rogue nation or evil actor decided to take over the network by manufacturing and introducing additional ASIC miners. There isn't anything inherently hard about producing these ASIC miners nor do they require years of research to design. Certainly not beyond the reach of an entity that has $30 million available to attempt to take control of the network. Say for the sake of argument China decided to do this and asked one of the dozens of chip manufacturers in China to produce 5000 ASIC miners.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:15:18
It's a different scenario here though if we're talking about severely improvished people who have trouble getting access to basic necessities (food, clothing, shelter, power etc)

'i think' and 'just has to implement'. If this is the basis of your argument, i think you might be one spreading FUD.
