Thank you! sorry for all the questions.
Last one, on the top section what are the numbers on the far right?
Is the the amount that they are willing to buy or sell for that price? Those numbers seem kind of big.

Haha you are comedic.

Trust me, I analyzed the picture a lot more than once. The keys showing are not to anything that would compromise my safety and i don't have any haters that i know of... i'd consider my self a friendly person. Plus i always answer the door with my glock tucked into the back of my pants.
Thank you for your concern though. And no i'm not sure what you mean about "selling my book for btc". That's not me.
Edit: I don't have the same user name anywhere on the internet... that is something i pride myself in.

Refresh bro.... refresh.

Okay good, that's what I suspected.
So the top section is essentially just bids to buy and sell and the bottom part are the trades that actually go through?

I have to admit, that was one of the funniest things I've read in a while.

By the way, the reason I have 5 of basically the same thing is so that i can keep them in all different locations. Not just to have 5 of the same thing all in one place.

Okay so what are the numbers that are in the bottom box that are on the far right and in white?
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:49:01
Okay i will. I just thought i'd get my question answered faster here since the community is considerably larger.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:22:24
Now that was a damn good 6 minutes... share.
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:39:01
lol :)

Thanks for the info. So what could I use that isn't paper and would retain data for more than a few years?
And no worries I make sure every important file I have is fully encrypted... winzip does a great job.

The picture makes that ad look like it's from the 50s.
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:57:29
Yes they came from a HDD that has been completely wiped. Hmmm alright, well i suppose i could be creative. Metal engraved keys would be nice, I suppose wood would work too. I just don't like the idea of using something as flimsy as paper. I really do appreciate your advice as i'm still doing my best to educate myself on how to properly secure my digital cryptocoins.
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:18:34
Thank you. That definitely helps me understand it better.
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:31:57
Do you have something with a little bit more explanation and possibly some examples?
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:46:04
Personally if I feel like gambling i just play satoshi dice or go here:

It's nice to see that it's not one of those shitty robocoin btc machines.
