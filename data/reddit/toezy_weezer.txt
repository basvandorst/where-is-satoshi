Crypto can't replace fiat, which is why its fallen under the scope of the ctfc...
Its deflationary, there is no governing body who determines circulation, and it cannot be duplicated or faked.
Its a Commodity, and the world is trading it in 100 different currencies. The market cap is 230 billion

Sell them before it reaches zero and be done with it.
If you had just taken that money that bought those miners and bought bitcoin youd still be farther ahead.

I can assure you, you ask anyone in the industry, banks are faggots When it comes to starting a crypto company.
I have been close with Bofa, Chase, and Wellsfargo. They dont tell you why, they send you a fuck you letter in the mail, and you have to withdraw your entire account in a cashiers check that takes a week to process.

It's a scam, the potential for energy lies with perfecting fission, current reactors are barely 10% efficient. 
GE lobbyist maintain a monopoly on reactor rod production and lobby to make the cost of research and development prohibitive.
@_date: 2019-08-14 07:28:53
It's not much cleaner, the fusion reactor walls are made of Beryillium, get bombarded with high energy neutrons, must get replaced periodically, and are radioactive for thousands of years.

btc was put through the gauntlet from 2013-2017, banking institution would randomly close Corporate accounts, silk road was brought down, Mt.Gox Collapsed, and stole everybody's cash.
