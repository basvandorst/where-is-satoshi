ELI5 why is the Indian government so negative towards bitcoin?
Edit: Thanks for all the insight! Reading up on corruption and tax evasion in India now

This whole BCH and strange market behavior makes me feel really uneasy for some reason... I hope there is no major scam on the horizon

What's the deal with the .org one?
I am honestly surprised how little news of scams there are so far with all them people trying to get their BCH into exchanges and no official support

That's why we want a global currency! Farewell local propaganda and fake news

Now they only all have to agree to use the BHC ticker and not the one reserved by bitconnect

Easy to blame bitcoin for these issues instead of tackling them properly. A shame really.

I would open a new support ticket

I don't think there is a way around it apart from doing what the support ticket says (minus the e-mail address).
Don't use spam e-mail addresses for real accounts involving your money and security!

Literally me. When I finally fall asleep I have a nightmare of my cryptos crashing so first thing in the morning is to check my blockfolio again
