No. By design it actually pays less.

Whelp, I finally finished reading the thread, and I have to say that I like what I hear. Unfortunately for us both, I am not a TX resident, but I do enjoy the discussion so I'd like to open up a few topics.
1. You stated in a post that you support term limits, but don't feel that they will do much of anything. I don't much care for quoting dead men as speaking the absolute truth, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the following:


2. I appreciate how reasonable that you've come off in this thread. What was the last position that you held which has changed, what did it change to, how did it change, and when did it change?
3. I consider myself a minarchist and don't, in general, consider taxes to be theft by the state. I did appreciate your thoughts on income tax and the potential to replace it with a property tax. Can you share more about this idea? Has it been proposed by anyone else to your knowledge? Would it just be a land tax, or would it also encompas other posessions? 
I realize that I'm not your target audience so I asked the questions in public so someone else might benefit from the discussion as well. Thank you for your time, and good luck :)

EDIT: Nevermind, I found it. I didn't realize this thread was so long.

I'll say the same thing. Lately I've seen the the word libertarian associated with strict AnCap philosophies. I think it would be helpful for you and the whole spectrum of libertarian philosophy if more candidates that generally fall into it can demonstrate that L/libertarian does not mean AnCap.

You can't be serious. You simply can't be.
