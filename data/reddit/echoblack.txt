I only allow my bitcoin client to connect to Tor Hidden Serivces, but simply Tor is good enough.
I buy bitcoins however and assume they are traceable.
I send every single bitcoin in the wallet to my SilkRoad account. Then delete the wallet and make a new one.
Send all the bitcoins back to the new wallet from SilkRoad.
That should really be good enough. There is no way to prove for sure that any of these coins belong to you after SilkRoad is done with them. Heck, you could even tell a questioning party, "Oh, I never even got the coins. I antecedently sent them to the wrong address", Or "I sent the coins directly to someone who sold me this motherboard on IRC."

At least Steve made it clear the people by drugs with cash every day. Sure I agree that you should never invest money you are not willing to loose. However, I it killing me that people on TV almost never talk about how easy and safe it is to pay for things with bitcoin.
It also is killing me that over and over people keep saying "No one knows who controls bitcoin!" YES we do and they should be interviewing them. Contact the bitcoin foundation. Talk to Gavin or other developers.

Mining is the only way Bitcoins are crated.
The only way two ways to "Peg" a currency are...
 The Central bank and Government agree to pass and enforce regulations that a currency can only be traded for a certain price. (right?...)
 You can create as much of the currency you want to peg as you like. Then you simply buy and sell on the interbank network to keep the price fixed. The Swiss Bank started doing this in 2011
The first option is imposable because Bitcoin is per-to-per and can be traded anywhere.
That just leaves the second option which is also imposable because Bitcoins are created in a decentralized way and at a fixed rate.

Lastpass is also a perfect fit for Bitcoin Users.
Lastpass knows how to do cloud security the correct way. You can store your Bitcoin wallet as an encrypted attachment to a secure note in Lastpass.
But for the love of god, use a 50+ character long pass-phrase and a Yubikey for your Lastpass account. Also, go though all the security options and harden it up.
Like, I have a dedicated Lastpass Yubikey. One slot is use as a OTP. The other spits out a 65 character string. So, I type in a 14 character pass-phrase and then hit the 65 character string to make a 79 character pass-phrase.

1) Those are really just paranoia posts. Just use electrum and keep your password and seed in LastPass, heck you can even keep a bitcoin wallet in lastpass secure notes as an attachment.
2) 80% of the benifits of bitcoin right now are for the seller not the buyer. For the buyer the main benefit right now is that you don't have to be concerned about the seller getting hacked and loosing your credit card numbers.
3) Well, really paying with bitcoin is WAY easier then paying with your credit card. As for buying bitcoins, this is a problem that is being solved. Right now the easiest way is with bitinstant through ZipZap.

My logic went something like this....
If they would use a sha512 hash of the $keyString then AES-256 would always be used.
When encoding the $keyString in base64 the resulting output has the same number of bits of entropy. If you use sha512 instead the resulting output will be 512 bits. Hashing solves the single quote problem too.
Yes, it adds entropy. That is the main reason you want to add a salt to the AES key. I am also sure there is known plain text in a wallet file.
SHA-{1,2,3}, MD5, Whirlpool... are all designed to be used for data integrity checking NOT secure storage of passwords (i.e. they are FAST!, Free to implement in Hardware). If you want to use them to store a password you need to use at least 5,000 rounds. The salt is only there to prevent against pre-computed Hash lookup tables. It dose not add strength to the pass-phrase beyond that.
99% of people will use a pass-phrase that will not have 512 bits of entropy. That means that the weakest point will still be brute forcing the pass-phrase. That is why you need to do at least 5,000 rounds of hashing to make it harder.

Let me rephrase it...
Markets level off for a time after a triangle. That is why the price has been staying steady. This is not fishy. 'I think' the next move will be down, testing the resistance lines, because it looks to me like a down sloping triangle.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:25:50
The volume is the same as it was before the big bubble triangle. The volume in massive price fluctuations like that is always going to be crazy high. What you are seeing now is normal volume.

I know that it dose not use the SHA-256 sum of the unsalted password as the AES key. It uses a base64 encoded version for the AES key. I was saying that it should use a hash as the AES key and not a base64, because base64 dose not add to the key size.
base64 only encodes the same bits in base 64 math, so the output has the same number of bit's as the input.
echo -n 1234567890 | base64 -
echo -n 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | base64 -
A SHA-512 hash always has a 512 bit output regardless of the input size
echo -n 1234567890 | sha512sum -
echo -n 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | sha512sum -
Salts do not make it harder to brute-force a password hash. They only make it so you can not use a pre-computed hash lookup table.

Sure, if you live in say the USA, Canada, Germany, UK.... the only reason a consumer would prefer to pay in Bitcoin is if they want to have a level of anonymity. Also, because they do not trust the seller to keep their credit card numbers and what not safe.
However, there are big incentives for Retailers worldwide to prefer to sell in Bitcoin. (we here all know what they are). Then when many sellers want to sell in Bitcoin because of these benefits, consumers will want to pay in Bitcoin because it is accepted in so many places which makes it easy to use.
This is where the deflationary aspects of Bitcoin really help. It is the people speculating and becoming early adopters that will help get the ball rolling. If there was no monetary incentive for people to become early adopters, Bitcoin may never take off.

I very much liked this interview. Sure, I think that VC's want some defined legal framework for Bitcoin to operate in. They do not want to invest money into something and have the rug pulled out from under them. So, I guess regulation would be good, as long as it dose favor Startups.

And you don't use a proprietary OS.
But no, with $30K I would not trust any computer (OS install) that has ever been online.
Hell, with $30K on the line, just go by a dedicated Bitcoin laptop or two. Do a fresh install of Linux and never, ever put the laptops on any network.

If you were to try to brueforce the AES key it would take you 10,000 times longer.
This is what Lastpass dose (you can configure the rounds of AES lastpass uses.)

WOW, That was really a stupid thing to write!
Max Keiser wrote that? I thought he knew what Bitcoin was...
I mean sure, there are real benefits to pegging a currency. However, this is impossible to peg the price of Bitcoin to anything.
Soooo, why the heck would he waste his time writing this? It just makes him look.... well proves he dose not know what he is talking about.

What is wrong with using Mt Gox's Checkout Button?
Edit: Boy, I just took a look at it and it is fantastic! Wow like really, don't understand why this is not what everyone is suggesting.
Edit2: I see now why it sucks.... Dose the customer have to have a Mt Gox account? If so... it is useless.
Edit3:.... Okay so the "Mt.Gox instant Merchant API" dose allow the customer to pay with Bitcoins. However, I have no idea how one uses this API? The Mt Gox website seems to have no links to setup info, strange? .. Oh, it links to bitcoin.it to show how to use it... even stranger? Why would they not host this info on their website?

We just closed out big triangle. The price is going to stay between ~$100-~$120 for a bit until we decide to keep going up or start testing the lines of resistance.
'I think' we will first go down. Maybe test ~$50 before we go back up and try to brake $266

You need to use a kernel hardened with grsecurity &amp; pax
The package is in Archlinux's AUR. The only thing you need to change in the shipping config is to disable the grsecirty sysctl support.
It is WAY easier to use then you may think. The linux-pax-flags package takes care of all the little pax flags that need to be set.

1) The general public. NO.
2) Payment processors take care of that. Be it software or a third party.
3) As long as there is at least some fraction of one bitcoin available bitcoin is sill as useful as ever. Bitcoin is not simply a financial interment. Its real value is as a payment system.
4) Usefulness as a payment system.
5) Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. Same as 
6) This problem is being solved. Bitinstant is what I use.

I agree it is fairly clear that an exchange operating in the USA will be regulated. Mt.Gox is in Japan.
A miner is not a money transmitter. Miners do not create Bitcoins nor transmit Bitcoins.
Technically all Bitcoins have already been created. The Bitcoins that a miner gains possession over are not given to nor earned by the miner. The miner simple figures out a way to be able to spend the Bitcoins that are already defined in the code.
Miners clearly do not transmit any Bitcoins. All they do is verify the integrity of the hash tree, block chain. The Bitcoins are not transmitted in the block chain. It is just the ledger.
The transmission of Bitcoins from one address to another address happens when a person signs the transaction on there own computer. They only transmit the record of this transaction to the Bitcoin network so it can be added to the ledger and verified by the miners.

Who runs Bitcoin and where is it run from?
 and the P2P network
How do I know I can trust bitcoin?
It is Open Source. You can audit the code yourself or have someone you trust audit the code for you.
Why is the market so volatile? The markets in which bitcoin is traded right now do not have the systems setup to stabilize the market i.e. Shorts, Leverage, Futures.

It is fantastic that other places to triad are opening up :)
However, be Very careful when choosing a broker. 9/10 are basically criminals aka "Market Makers." I have never heard of "Plus500" before. They stared in 2010... They are most likely market makers.
With market makers... basically you are betting against the broker. When you win money the broker looses money. To make it worse, the broker controls the network... Ya, as you can guess bad things happen.

This is true. However, in the USA you are not obligated to take care of your parents (which sucks when you become a parent). The upside to this is that in the USA you are not judged by who your parents are.
Basically, in the USA everyone is an individual. There are good things and bad things about this.

Right I agree with that, but that problem is not related to deflation.


Again, this is not related to deflation.
Yes, the Bitcoin economy will not exist if people do not use Bitcoin as a payment system and/or a native currency. However, the deflation dose not hurt it's adoption for these use cases.

A wallet that is not actively attached to your bitcoin wallet software. Preferably, a wallet that is encrypted with like Truecrypt + 128 character random password and stored on multiple USB flash drives... maybe one or two in a safety deposit box....
Basically, a cold wallet is a wallet that is not on your computer, but is stored as securely as you can make it.

Yes, they can. In fact, I think the US laws that were setup a few weeks ago was part of the reason for the positive speculation. Now there is a legal framework for bitcoin to operate in.
Ya, it would be nice to explain the technical side. However, this is the genus of the 10sec talk time. It is impossible for anyone to say something new. There is no time to explain it, so you just end up looking crazy.

.... Well, I spent $67 for 6 months of a VPS. Then ~$40 on a domain name all with Bitcoin in the past 40 days.

I will buy more.

I seriously doubt any "Keylogger Scrambler" actually works. It sounds like snake oil security to me.
Even if you run Linux on every machine like me, the best security will always be to boot into a Live CD.
This is because you can verify the integrity of the image before and after you burn it. After that you don't have to worry about it because there is no way it can be altered because it is on Read-Only media.
... Personally, I run Arch Linux Hardened with [grsecurity]( on all my systems. I also run AIDE for integrity checking before and after every software update.

I don't want to get into some OS debate on the Bitcoin subreddit. Use what you like.
The reason I said what I did.
I think you went about it the wrong way because before you did anything you should have checked hardware compatibility. Second, you should not be editing the xorg config files. If you want to use multiple monitors, like I do, just configure it in the desktop environment settings manager.
As for Wifi and Graphics drivers. Problem with Graphics driver, strange? You should have zero problem with graphics. WiFi drivers, if you have a cheap Broadcom Wireless card you will have problems, however those cards have problems on Windows too. On Windows with a broadcom card the driver will install, but it will randomly stop working forcing you to resent the card. All other wireless cards will work without a problem.

Then they didn't let Roger Ver respond.
All things that are really stupid. Read the source code dude.... however the mining pool problem is a real problem. Maybe if the news started picking on Bitcoin because of the epic mining pools we could finally solve that problem. One day soon a couple mining pools will get owned and bitcoin will fail.

Bitcoin IS an investment and trading instrument. USD is also.
Some people get the idea that it is a scam/game/git-rich-quick because all they hear about it this aspect of it. And like all trading instruments this aspect IS a scam/game/git-rich-quick.


Yep, we need more places to accept Bitcoin 100% true.
However, even if 99.999% of all Bitcoins are "Horded" aka "Saved" this dose not hurt the Bitcoin economy at all. The idea that it dose comes from people who do not realize that Bitcoin's are infinitively divisible.
Like if 99.999% of Gold is "Horded" then that makes Gold useless as a currency. This is because there would not be enough Gold to run the economy.
However, the only effect this will have on Bitcoin is make the price of Bitcoin go through the roof. There will still always be more then enough units of Bitcoin to run an economy.

If you want the shopping cart to be automated.
Then you ether need to know how to code a little bit, pay a one time fee for someone to code the shopping cart for you, or pay a continuous fee for something like bitpay.
