Jack Liao is a legit straight up dude. Had dinner with him in BKK 10 days ago. No bullshit, smart, straightforward and outspoken person. As for Craig.... Well he can speak for himself well enough I guess. Wow.

I know! A few months ago I sent koval a note requesting the feature of being able to donate btc- not taking credit here.... Just saying that its a great idea to take  moment to suggest the option to those free services you value.

Headline reads "Facebook stock is not so different from bitcoin". Discusses the nature of Facebook stock as a non legal tender financial instrument in the recent all stock purchase of WhatsApp and compares it to bitcoin. Interesting editorial perspective from one of the largest news networks

Simple Genius. Don't let it go - you should get it done.
The Point of Sale business is full of old guard, closed systems supported by long established companies. The distributors and dealers of 90% of the installed base has such an established and long term relationship with their clients that they remain the go to for introduction of this kind of innovation. They bill by the hour. Tax and tech changes are their bread and butter. Show them how they can make money from this and they will eat it up.
You have the proof if concept - kick start it - whatever.... Just do it
Sizeable startups are based on lesser ideas. I suggest you do not let this go into the wild. Perhaps it is not too late for you to make something of this yourself. Get some help!

Ill conceived and salacious editorial bullshit. This article deserves to be condemned with the rest of the self serving advertising driven media drivel which attempts to sell itself as "Analysis". Emily, please do credit the to the term journalist by coming to Reddit to defend your perspective. At best you are ill informed. At worst you serve a purpose which belies any relevance to journalism

Yubikey plus lastpass premium = genius way to generate and manage unique passwords for all your accounts. I am currently a user of the free version and will upgrade to premium as soon as yubikey accepts BTC :)

Oh FFS, get over yourselves. BTC is here to stay and in 10 years you will not know the difference between it and your current approach to handling payments. It will be seamless, integrated and, simply, money. Do you think of SMTP when you send email? Was that page called with ipv4 or 6? Was that a MMS, SMS or iMessage I just received?
FWiW I think trusted addresses should be done as a completely optional, voluntary thing. It's another indisputable value proposition for BTC. Just like your SSN when communicating with govt for taxes etc, your trusted address may take its place. What stops you from using 4,000,000 other addresses on 25 other blockchains? It's the underlying tech and not the bits that will count in 10 years.

Mmmmm..... Seems that a greater % of all litecoins that were mined still exist. Just a thought.

Yubi + lastpass premium is a specific offer which includes a one year subscription to lastpass. The subscription adds mobile device functionality to lastpass. With yubi neo which enables NFC its a pretty strong set of functions. A recent update to last pass greatly improved the autologin feature which used to be semi reliable but is better now. The massdrop offer is a good deal but does not include the lastpass subscription.
Lastpass without the 2fa of yubikey is certainly vulnerable. But, it certainly is better than my previous efforts to manually manage passwords.

Ultimately Krugman is a pragmatist. He wants to see a demonstration of value not simply a statement of value. What surprises me is that one of his peers (EG a globally recognized economist) has not joined the fray in opposition to Krugman. What this "argument" needs are reliable facts which demonstrate the economic utility of Bitcoin rather than enthusiastic renditions of features and benefits. Perhaps this will happen soon as Bitcoin is certainly too big to ignore and too important an idea to remain as a novelty issue of the VIPs and VSPs often the focus of Krugmans column inches.

Errr - cats outta the bag folks.... Any p2p crypto currency can function as a proxy for an exchange of value, whether it be btc, LTC etc etc. so if there is a will (or a market) something will fill the gap. Ideological polemics aside, the notion of a trusted address may add value to BTC. The blockchain has benefits and a potential for much more than it is today. To state that just because BTC is, was or will be use to facilitate illicit activity is, like "duh!". Just like cash it will apply to all functional economics without attribution to source or politic. Its a P2P thing people - make trusted address transactions. voluntary. Make the fees less - whatever. Just do not cloud the issue with black and white ideological thinking.

Even Avalon does burn ins on their machines. They have shown racks full of their machines running during burnin. If they are not actually mining with them during burnin they are idiots. Do you think Yufi is an idiot? I have many BFL machines on order and they will deliver. I hope they burn them in and test them for an hour or so before they show up. I want whatever arrives to work from the get go.
