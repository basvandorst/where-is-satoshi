So now it's become a collectible? Get real: Bitcoin's market share has plummeted. "Alts" are catching up and for good reason.

Bitcoin is more akin to MS DOS in the age of graphical operating systems. Amazon grew new tentacles every few months; Bitcoin hasn't solved the one issue it was intended for and almost certainly never will.

"Confirmed in less than 2 hours."
So, by that logic, I suppose dial-up internet still works in the age of broadband?

Welcome to Bitcoin: the "peer-to-peer electronic cash system."

The number 1 spot is not a divine right ordained to bitcoin. When it falls, and it will due to its inadequate governance, it will fall very quickly.

Wow, that's some interstellar level delusion there.

Bitcoin will not scale. It is almost non functional at this point and the lack of adequate governance ensures that things will only get worse. Accept this self evident fact.

This kind of delusional nonsense is why people are losi ng faith in the Bitcoin "community". Get real.

Wasn’t this proposed years ago?

Yeah.. $30 transaction fees are fine.. 30 min transaction times are fine..
When the price stops going up, maybe you'll wake up a little.

Everything is being built on top of EOS, Ethereum, Tron etc.

You’re still waiting for it?

I was referring to market cap, but if you want to refer to real utility and transactions then Bitcoin is faring far, far worse. See dappradar or blocktiivity

satoshi gave himself a fair few.

Bitcoin has lost half its market share in less than 2 years.

Not many care to understand. Surely that is self evident after a decade. People want to get rich and they don’t want a wildly volatile, inefficient currency. Your best bet is selling it as a super long term “store of value” that could moon
