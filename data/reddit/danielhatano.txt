Bitcoin for $1 USD not a bubble.
Bitcoin for $100.000 USD definitely is a bubble.

If I understand well they will not buy or sell the real bitcoin. They just use Kraken chart to determinate if some player was losing or wining money on them plataform. So the encrease value of Bitcoin that holders are waiting for, will not happen.

Good question

Ironic isin't? BTC was made to avoid using the Banks, but had to create a token to make BTC liquidity. 
Im pretty sure the creation of USDT will never become a good thing.

If you gonna buy, u will have no problem, because that Bitcoin was alread stolen from someone else. 
But if you gonna sell, be carefull, sometimes wasint that person you talking to the real payer. Becouse when you give you bank account to buyer make a deposit to you,  this person can fool another inocente victimn,  giving you bank info, and this third person thinking that talking to you, and paying for something else.
After this third inocent victmn make the payment he send the receip to this criminal buyer.
Then this buyer send to you,  you confirm the deposit, and release the bitcoins.
And what happening with this third inocent victimn?
He just get blocked on WhatsApp, or whathever and never receive for a product that he was dealing with that criminal buyer.
