"Due to increased suppply"....GPUs are as inexpensive as they are due to sales volumes, which ASIC BTC miners will never match.
Designing &amp; fabbing a processor is expensive. Unless you have a reasonable volume of sales to offset the cost, the prices won't ever really match GPU pricing. Of course, not having to have a full-on PCI-e card, memory, cooling etc. will reduce that overhead somewhat -- but ASIC miners are specialty items and will probably keep specialty pricing.

This almost sounds like an inflationary effect (upon those who no longer have the hash power) as their "slice" gets proportionally smaller. ?

OK, I'm learning something here, that's cool.
I had another thought: Pure PPS mining pools go out of business unless they gain ASIC members.

Well, I was thinking "I have the same amount of coins but they are worth less as more coins enter the market that I cannot earn" -- but maybe you are right.

This is just the CPU--&gt;GPU move, to the next order of magnitude. ASICs become the new GPUs. There *is* a difference though in that while GPUs are commonly available (mining is a secondary use) due to their primary function, ASICs are custom HW with only one use. This means availability will be limited to those who can afford it AKA "professional miners".
The days of the hobby miner, who mines while not playing games or has taken advantage of relatively cheap off-the-shelf HW, are numbered. This is indeed a *sea change in how Bitcoins are mined*. Newly discovered BTC will go to a smaller circle of miners. There will be an economic effect, not the least due to the *perception* of BTC being "more scarce".
There will be secondary effects on other crypto-currencies, as GPU miners possibly move en masse to LTC or whatever.
