Asic miners killed it, back in the day i could mine 100 bitcoins in less then a month with 2 ati 5870, now its really hard to get into.. Avalon doesn't sell chips anymore and I don't trust BFL at all.

i know your being a dumbass but people like you is why we can't have nice things, if more women were coders think of all the innovations we could have

it won't become a problem because u can still split the coins and the price will reflect how much coins are in circulation

Depends there are djs that spin disc and make remix, unless u mean like dj tiesto who actually removed dj from his name cus he is more of a producer.
It is not like the other people selling their crap whilst promoting bitcoin usage gets bitched at.
You can hate the guy's mixes but why hate on him for using bitcoins for his next album. 
Anyways this OP is gone so it doesn't matter anymore.

Can't wait to sell my xbox 1 as an xbox one
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:01:16
My thoughts is your wrong, go read up on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:39:51
lol what do you expect! this is what djs do ...they do remixes... and why do you think he is promoting.. thats cus he has only 6 followers.
lol i thought this was reddit not 4chan... looks like OP deleted his account nice reddit..

transactions fees, by then bitcoins would be worth a couple grand each.
oh yea... you should worry about how to cryo urself before you think about that issue.

Okay, don't panic... 
Bitcoins as you know generation rate will only decrease as difficulty gets harder, thus helping to make each bitcoin worth more.  So... you might of earned more money in 24 hours then in 5 years. 
A year ago, I generated over 100 bitcoins on my machine and sold it all for about $200 and I thought I was making a killing :D.

holy shit bro ur like on all the replies, i think we get the point.  Unless you are some shill for another company. gtfo.

hating on a guy that is giving away music and supporting bitcoins, real classy.

BFL is a scam, Avalon are not selling another batch and are mining themselves.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:33:58
actually it known for a fact that satoshi mined tons of coined at the beginning, it is unknown if he still has the coins in his possession, i suspect that he has deleted his wallet.  he also had schemes for trade/brokering system for items, though it was never implement by anyone in the way he explained.

That's cool, and since the price drop, you can get them for cheap :D
