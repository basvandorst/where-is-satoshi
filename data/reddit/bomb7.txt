Now, yes. These are still early days and Dubai wants to be in the lead. They`re not following India`s and Pakistan`s lead.
But yeah I think the reason they`re installing the ATMs is not for the benefit of the migrant workers (who Dubai doesn`t give two shits about). I think the purpose of the ATMs is to attract Bitcoiners who are wealthy but have liquidity problems, and also to seem cutting edge.

I had always assumed that I would have to pay taxes on my gains. Exactly how I demonstrate my gains is the hard part. Screen shots from my exchange transaction histories? I could do that but they`re in USD not yen, so I`d have to look for the historical USD-yen exchange rate. Pain in the ass.
I`ve kept receipts from ATM purchases, but those are in Canadian dollars.
I don`t think Japanese tax accountants will have any idea what they`re looking at.

I don`t trust this fag as far as I can throw him. He`s buddies with Mark, lives across the street from Mtgox`s (now former) office, and was sitting with Mark in the mtgox office on Sunday for the Bitcoin Foundation meeting. He didn`t know about the missing coins on Sunday? Bullshit. 
People were still putting in deposits until the very moment gox went offline. Anyone who held back info about the lost coins is a party to robbery.

The price had been over $200 just a few hours earlier. I was trading on gox in its final hours and it had fallen rapidly down from over $200 to around $100, then started coming back up a bit.
The drop from about $150 to $100 happened in a matter of minutes. I assumed it was just whales manipulating things but maybe it was Gox.

I`m a longterm resident of Japan and I can tell you a couple things - Japanese people cower very easily, so Mtgox`s Japanese support staff have probably become very frightened by the community response. The protesters aren`t scary, but death threats and very angry support tickets are certainly coming in too. So the office move (which may or may not be true, it could be a smokescreen) could be to keep the staff from bailing. If the security problems include visits by Japanese mobsters - that exacerbates it even more because those guys are feared.
The other thing is that landlords in Japan will come down on you for having this kind of attention on their property, because negative events make the property undesirable and lower its value (ie. any apartment where a crime has been discovered is rented out at a large discount). It`s a superstition that the space is tainted, etc.
So I can see the property issue as being a real issue and not just an excuse. They really are in a deep mess and are trying to get themselves out, but I don`t think Karpeles knows what to do and one thing after another is piling up on top of him. Hopefully he`s in close consultation with others and implementing their suggestions to the t.
Andreas Antonopolous has been helping them and apparently has said he strongly believes there is no insolvency, that Karpeles is just in way over his head.

re: Warren Buffet, his investment strategy is consistent risk avoidance. He says that there are 2 rules of investing: 1) Never lose. 2) See  With that in mind, his avoidance of Bitcoin makes perfect sense.

Great post. I am relatively new to Bitcoin (a few months) and I know when I first got involved I was shocked and confused by the security measures required to hold Bitcoin. I asked a friend where I should keep the bitcoins I`ll buy, and he started telling me about secure paper wallets and how I need to buy an extra computer that has never been connected to the internet, etc. I remember thinking "What? Why? This sounds totally useless and will never be mainstream if the learning curve is this steep". 
Of course the technology is new, but Bitcoin is nowhere near mainstream adoption and won`t be until it can be easy to secure and easy to use. Not easy for tech nerds, easy for your mom or for a kid. The security issues can be addressed through insurance, but that nullifies one of the core benefits of Bitcoin - near-zero transaction fees. So we need to think about what the benefits of Bitcoin really are.
As for speed, I haven`t made any retail transactions with BTC yet, but I have bought BTC from the ATM in Vancouver - and the delays were long. They have an attendant standing there at the ATM telling everyone "Don`t worry that you just put $1000 into the ATM and you haven`t received your Bitcoin yet. It will appear within a couple hours" - to which buyers would just stand there confused for a moment wondering what to do, then slowly wander away,  having FAITH that their Bitcoin would appear. But what if it didn`t appear?
People who want to believe in Bitcoin will accept a situation like that. But most people don`t give a fuck about Bitcoin or any other technology - they will only use it if it is useful, easy, and secure. I can`t imagine my Dad putting $1000 into an ATM and walking away without having received anything. There would be a whole lot of "This is an outrage! Give me my money back!"
These are issues that can be addressed, at least possibly. There is a lot of profit motive for people to address these issues and find solutions. Those are the people who I hope become very wealthy from Bitcoin, not the early adopters who blindly evangelize in the hopes of becoming billionaires.

I wired about $400 from my (domestic Japanese) bank account literally 30 minutes or so before gox went offline. I knew I was risking it so I`m not too angry - but my experience is absolute proof that they were taking deposits even when they were certain that they were already fucked.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:37:12

I wonder if in the near future there will be a lot of people going on vacation to countries with bitcoin ATMs so they can liquidate their coins off the books. Maybe to spend them or buy gold or something.
If I was American I would be splitting wallets so that I had a simple "investment" wallet that I declared to the IRS, and another wallet that I only used for not-so-traceable spending and liquidation. How are they going to know unless you show them?

Most people in the West really have little reason to USE bitcoin at the moment. It`s easier to pay with cash/paypal, so they`d rather keep their BTC as an investment.
The growth in Bitcoin USE is going to come from developing countries, places where their currency is shit and corruption is rampant. We need to reach out to those countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere that really NEED Bitcoin. Countries like that could see large scale adoption and be the leverage points of growth.

I feel gutted by this. I think this is the single worst thing to happen to Bitcoin. It`s worse than Gox, in the sense that Cyprus got fucked by the banks and people there were desperately looking for ways to keep their money safe, and along comes Bitcoin - the revolutionary new currency that keeps your money safe from government theives and bankers. 
Aaaaaand it`s gone. People who sought refuge in Bitcoin got fucked. That`s worse than speculators losing their money on Gox, in my opinion.

I`m starting to think that Andreas is completely talking out of his ass. Sure he understands the technology, but does he understand the industry or economics? He was wrong about Gox`s solvency, wrong about this, wrong about what else?

Are you serious? Do you think that every person who buys Bitcoin has been in it long enough to know about mtgox`s past issues, and spends all their free time reading reddit threads about Bitcoin? Some people heard about bitcoin quite recently, and were introduced to mtgox as the biggest exchange. Some people had money in there and assumed it was safe because they put their money in (what they thought was) a financial services exchange. They only found out the troubles when they tried to withdraw, or started seeing headlines in mainstream news.
Not everyone is a cryptonerd who understands paper wallets and whatnot.

It will have a much bigger impact on business adoption if Bitcoin users start doing their shopping with Bitcoin and ask each shop if it accepts BTC. If businesses see a lot of potential customers wanting to genuinely spend BTC, they`ll adopt it. 
At the moment, all we can do is convince a business to accept it but then nobody actually spends money with them - which doesn`t create any incentive for other businesses to follow suit.
