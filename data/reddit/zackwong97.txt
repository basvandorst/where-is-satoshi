I'm in need of a lightning network bitcoin logo for a video i'm making. I'm scare that if I design one with my idea of combination Black, White, Orange &amp; Blue (Bitcoin + Segwit + Lightning) people will hate it because it's "no longer bitcoin"

@_date: 2018-01-29 06:56:37

@_date: 2017-12-04 06:23:41
I know how the federal reserve works! It just prints money when they don't have the money to buy the stuff they want!
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:16:18
Just leave it at coinbase, it's not worth transferring it to a personal address right now. Wait till coinbase has segwit or do that gdax thing
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:51:36
No, I found out by myself
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:12:34
Dude why not you take that euro and go buy btc yourself...
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:26:40
what u mean buy new bitcoin from blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:07:08
if you invested like 40$ then there is no point to withdraw your bitcoin at this moment. Just leave it where ever it is or only transfer if the fees are free.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:25:13
keep up the good work! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:29

@_date: 2018-10-20 18:42:15

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:21:49

That's why bitcoin &amp; proof of work coins will die in the future
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:12:14
It's funny how the other day I crossposted a topic about the rich using bitcoin vs the poor and it got flagged as "Off topic" and well look at this post, has nothing to do with bitcoin it's up here.

most of the trading volume for top coins are all coming from bithumb/korea recently. what are you trying to tell us here?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:22:02
That's why I always say bitcoin was never decentralised in the first place

the transaction fee is 3x the average meal in my country. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:07:39
because i got 30k~ satoshi left in a wallet and instead of just leaving it there why not just put 1 sat/b fee and wait. I choose 1 sat/b but don't know why it was 1.281 sat/b.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:58:37
