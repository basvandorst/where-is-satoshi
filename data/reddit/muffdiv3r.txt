Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down.
If it was always up, you would be looking at a ponzi.

You can adjust the fee you pay in Bitcoin, when using a regular wallet.
WARNING! if you try to pay no fee, your coinz will never make it. Really low fees take forever. Like days, in worst case.

If you're not careful, you could spend $17 for pizza.
Bitcoin is an unregulated commodities market. Moving money always cost money so you do as little of it as possible.
When you do use bitcoin as a currency, its typically product specific and you're watching those swings and now ready to spend during an uptick.
PS, those swings are where people make money.
