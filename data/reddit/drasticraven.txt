My university has one of the largest educational trading floors in the World full of bloomberg terminals, insanely useful!

Seems like every event is promoted as 'the largest x', do they all happen to be the largest or is everyone lying? 
£500 a ticket is also atrocious,  these events are barely worth £50.

I couldn't disagree more, introducing young people to cryptocurrency allows for a lot of opportunities. I've been in Bitcoin since 15, now 20 and it's taken my career to places that I couldn't have imagined before.
I've been able to access opportunities such as being an startup founder, executive at startup, financial freedom at a young age that I would have never been able to reach hadn't it not been for Bitcoin. On the other hand, I have now joined the darkside working for IB.
However, with all of the above, it is important that we focus on teaching young people about the community, the benefits and the technology behind Bitcoin rather than price. On the other hand, you could teach them about money management and trading techniques.
