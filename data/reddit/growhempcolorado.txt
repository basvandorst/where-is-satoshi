I bet you'll be able to pay a dentist to use stem cells in order to self-repair my teeth with BTC before he accepts gold as payment and then subsequently puts it in said tooth; in fact when I was in Zurich there was a Dentist who came to the meetups and openly took BTC for his services if I recall correctly. 
So, no... I think it has real use-cases in the 'meat-space' as it were, despite your reluctance and the fact that its not currently or widely used as a direct medium of exchange for goods/services. 
I just find this piss-poor 'Peter Schift-esque' regurgitation of what is money so tiresome in 2018, if you haven't realized it 'Money' is the biggest myth Man has ever devised (second only to Organized Religion) it is seriously an abstraction--if not a commonly agreed upon metaconcept all together--with immense implications on the Human Condition and the sooner we get out of the archaic notions imposed by the predispositions made by Nation-States who have had a monopoly on it, the better. If you're wondering it was Monarchs/Heads of State that decided what was money in their eyes and depending on who's head was on it made it invalid, not the merchant who provides the goods/services. 
A point poignantly driven into me recently by someone who lived through the collapse of Yugoslavia (in the fucking 90s) over dinner where being caught with German mark or USD meant a bullet to the head. No questions asked.

[Universal basic Income, it was a big deal actually. They littered the parliament in Bern with coins if you recall. It was a big optics hoax because as I said, public services and works programs if you're Swiss pretty much ensure you have a UBI regardless and University or apprenticeship is pretty accessible and protected, discriminating so actually if you're not from there.](
I mean I get it.., in a sense when you see a lot of kids drinking at the SBB instead of working menial jobs stocking shelves at Co-Op that you'd naturally think they would mis-use the money, but for such a small population and such a high suicide rate you'd think they'd try something to stop it: 'hey, here is some seed money, maybe you and your drinking buddies can make a start-up and get over the need to be intoxicated at 10am on a Wednesday because you found purpose in your Life(s).'
Instead they look the other way and pretend it isn't happening, much like the Syngenta guy, destroying what Ag land you have with large scale pesticide use only makes the country more food insecure, and even more expensive than it already is; but that's hard to see when you can drop what amounts to tens of thousands of francs because some 'outsider' pissed you off when he tells you how broken your Ag system is and how you are culpable of starving the very people who put food on your table in the process. (I'm acutely aware of this, I worked along side them despite doing the 'expensive sustainable form' and often ate at their tables when I did assist them; many families have to work days jobs just to support the family farm.)
OZ = Slang for Australian
Ag = Agriculture, maybe my handle didn't make this clear? 
Euro-peg was a huge deal, artificially debasing their currency was cause for a great deal of resentment, especially towards Germans/Germany; which was already pretty bad, especially in higher professions like a physician. It wasn't just a 'Bunsli', dude, it was anyone who had to see their pay measured in Euro's value instead of their 'relics' stability. Most of the youth I knew traveled to the EU frequently so were acutely aware of it, and those who had to do their grocery shopping outside of Switzerland to feed their family--a more common occurrence than I anticipated for a country with such a high standard of living. But that is more due to subsidy/protectionist tariffs in Ag/food than anything else, its really sad to see how many people are actually mal-nourished (mainly poor youth and elderly) as animal protein is so expensive and inaccessible. Moreso over how an entire task force is assigned to ensure it with pretty harsh penalties if you're caught. Hunger isn't a crime, and is often what leads to revolts, especially in that part of the World.  
Hardly, the Swiss franc has been a rollercoaster to say the least, after the peg was released it reached parity with the US dollar several times, and even dipped below it. So, no... its a relic, it doesn't exist, its a figment of their collective imagination(s) as are all fiat currencies (which is my entire point) as they needed to debase their currency to maintain what exports EU/Asia/US could or would support. Maybe you haven't realized their has been a World wide currency war since 2008 going on? And why this whole Crypto thing started in the first place. 
I really enjoyed my time in Switzerland, but it was because of the people I met and still keep in touch with, not the policies or governance structures; in fact I'd say its pretty tyrannical with a much more polished veneer as its done from the guise of the 'many' rather than the 'few.' I'm one of the few people that have seen first hand how scared your country becomes on May Day and how quickly places like Zurich turns into a Police State with riot police on every other corner.

As a non-Swiss person that lived in various cantons, neither do I unfortunately. They couldn't even get a form of UBI passed in a country where it pretty much already exists in everything but name and already has 'free' university tuition--all while [suffering from a massive but widely unspoken suicide epidemic amongst the youth.](
I sat across a man (early gen X) from Novartis-Syngenta escorting two OZs across the the country on the SBB to Zurich on my way back home, and when we got to talking about sustainable Ag in Switzerland, my role within it for the past 3 years and Crypto, he scoffed and said he'd place an order for 100 new shares as soon as he got home. 
The look of contempt on his face was... astonishing. The older OZ (a boomer of some sort) actually put his hand on my knee in some distressed form of discomfort of the situation, as to say, 'sorry for his behaviour, but this is the World we left you.' (Worst yet, they all thought I'd actually have a drink with them when we got to town and extended the offer unashamed of what had just occurred.)
I'm afraid that is more common amongst the affluent class than I ever expected, having only lived in remote rural Ag dorfs it clouded my judgment of the country (as a whole) for most of my time there--who, while admittedly clueless to tech are still more open to the idea of revamping the broken financial model and were amiable to such discourse even if they disagreed about certain points that outlined its imperative nature. And some were just as, if not more wealthy, than most people walking the streets of Geneva, Zug or Zurich.   
They have a lot to gain from it, and they;re small enough to be able to experiment with it successfully before applying it to a larger economy; I just don't see it happening, either, I'm afraid. Although the Swiss government did back Ambrosus so they have made efforts toward that end. 
But the Swiss franc is a relic of Swiss stability, an identity almost, one that represents reliability in uncertain times, they are not letting that one go anytime soon. The peg to the Euro was a double edged sword that left a foul taste in their collective mouths--and mine as I was on USD sourced funds. Though to be honest other than the coins, they really have hideous bills. The 10 franc note in particular is terrifying, that guy's eyes still haunt me.

We have the [Bitcoin Meetup in Boulder]( hosted by Burt Wagner on a monthly basis, I've been meaning to add a more technical oriented workshop meetup with a hands on approach to make it a bi-monthly event. 
Let me know if you want to collaborate and make that happen, I have a found a venue with a BTM and plenty of space and a large screen to do presentations, but due to my scheduling constraints and the businesses it would likely have to be a weekend affair its right by CU, too.

That's very odd, given the amount of interest we have received from WA; we subsequently have to turn them down as we are currently focusing on hemp, and the industries that support a dispensary (lights, trimmers, grow mediums etc...) at this time.
I'd recommend they explore purchasing a crypto-pad to suit there needs as a result.  
Colorado has been really receptive to us, and 1620 Solutions and Hempslist will be the first Bitcoin/crypto based company to be invited to IndoExpo in its entire History!

That's really unfortunate, as I think they were leaders in this space with their wallet as well as the other services they provide. I just hope they can keep things together and seek viable funding instead of abandoning it. It does seem like its barebones support wise as of late. 
I know that token sale didn't go well, but it'd be a severe loss to the community if they were to fall to the way-side like that. 
I think Airbitz is another good option that has had a good reputation and robust support and updates, i haven't used them in a while but its definitely something worth keeping around as a plan B wallet on any device.

I want to take the time to address something as well as put a much deserved spotlight on Jean as deserves the a lot of credit; while its true that this isn't in line with the purist frame of mind that most Bitcoiners subscribe to, it does indeed fill a usecase to broaden the user-base to new users. 
I find utilizing technology people are already used to and can 'rely' on goes a long way to segue into integrating any new technology it may not be the most time efficient way, but its sure to deliver results; to many who don't go outside their own circles or personal comfort zones its unfathomable to believe that other's aren't ready or willing to jump 'all in' to what is a very *fringe* concept when it comes to commerce and finance. 
Great job, Jean and the rest of the Shake Team; you guys are making huge amounts of progress in the short period since your launch. We at GHC look forward to see what more you have in store for us.
All the Best!

@_date: 2016-11-12 07:06:17


Assuming that was even the intended goal: yeah, it seems so. Heartbreaking. 
This is a tragic and acute response, albeit at too high a cost, to underscore the imperative need for Ag and Bitcoin (or something like it) to create a closed eco-system; much of Man's suffering comes when they are denied of basic needs: food is behind only Air and Water.
My heart is torn for these people, this is a personally emotive expose; it cuts deep. I only hope we can collectively learn from their experiences.

I think I made it rather clear that an alt currency could fill that void as BTC currently undergoes this current higher tx costs-block mining delays, as to the pricing of the goods: the purpose behind a CSA is to actually buy a share of the farm for a given season; meaning with a **single transaction** (often prior to the growing season, but could be adapted to suit this need given the circumstance) you will be provided a weekly allotment of the harvest the entire season.
You're trying to discredit a system--successful one mind you--without taking into account the very mechanics of how it functions because you're relying on your steadfast view that a tx must be done in real time as you're accustomed to doing; they don't have to in this system and has flourished in areas like Detroit that had similar situations when all the grocery stores pulled out of the area; you normally purchase these CSA shares and pick up deliveries at city centers/stores or public areas like a library or near shop where you could easily have wifi accessibility. 
So let me put this into a context you can understand for simplicities sake, but understand prices/terms are arbitrary:
Family X goes to local Farm A and purchases a monthly CSA share (some farms could possibly accommodate monthly payment installments given the dire need) for $4 that requires them to work 10 hours/week on the farm to reduce the nominal cost to Farm A and still provide them enough to feed their entire family and service the other share holders for that season; they send their $4.14 in BTC or whatever crypto currency they choose to said farm, who can then choose to keep in BTC or load it onto a CC from Xapo or the like to pay for supplies or exchange on the Market. 
Family X then will have a weekly allotment from the farm, and because they have chosen to work for a set period of time on the farm they often are offered the excess vegetables/eggs/bread which cannot be sold or included in the CSA share(s) as it is often given to the volunteers and workers of said farm who are in need. A farm loses a lot of their harvest and ends up as waste (ideally composted) due to it not being 'up to' consumer retailer standards, which when placed in my personal hands fed teams of up to 3-10 people for lunch and dinner.

Hey, everyone, thanks for taking the time to read the article and why we feel this an integral component to moving both the Hemp industry forward, but perhaps more relevant to most of you, having a solid use case for a closed-looped ecosystem within Ag-bitcoin. We're not averse to the use of cash, but in an ideal system the need to exit into the fiat system is less than desirable given how much we can do with btc. 
Personal shouts to the whole Mycelium team, particularly Dmitry (Rassah) we had a blast that weekend! 


While we advocate the use of all of those aforementioned services... but, not quite, our subsidiary services 1620Solutions.com offer farmers the ability to lock-in their current BTC balances into the current USD price to avoid price volatility if they so desire as a feature when they sign up for an account. We work one-one with our clients and they all have specific needs, some like to diversify their btc and like to keep a percentage in btc, and decided to cash out some profits during the recent price rise to $740, which they all agreed was a nice windfall.
They really get the necessity to hedge themselves, but they require some time to explain how seamless it all is once inside the btc ecosystem.
We also offer the ability to use traditional payment methods (credit cards) to pay their suppliers, purchase goods/services as well the ability to withdraw cash from those very same cards--fees apply, of course. 
We have been trying out an NFC solution to add as an adjunct payment option that we hope to be able to offer moving forward, and I'm happy to say things have been going rather well!
All the Best

We'd also like to emphasize that California also legalized Industrial Hemp with the passage of Prop. 64, a nice homage to CO's Amendment 64, which we feel is quite a noteworthy fact left out of this conversation: given CA's Ag prowess and that it just legalized the cultivation of a vital cash crop with a myriad of uses that requires much less water than traditional cultures! This is cannot be overstated! 
There is still much to be discussed about execution, but until that is done we will remain optimistic about its possibilities.
Congratulations, California; you did it!

Interestingly enough Edgar told me he had no idea what that meant for the better part of it's History since its inception; its apparently a play on '420 Solutions.'  
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:16:54
Hey, Simplebud, where about in California? 
Edgar is originally from SoCal, and he has had meetings with dispensary owners who have shown equal amounts of enthusiasm for Bitcoin as they do for Hemp, but are simply unaware of its mechanics. In fact he came back to CO with the idea of the 'Cryptopad' he show-cased off at the Denver event to try and offer something for the MJ industry. 'Hardware and Education as a service,' is how he put it.
Essentially, what is a laptop with all of the necessary software and security to operate from,with the aim of follow up workshops being held to custom tailor it to  their particular business and future commerce needs. Luckily some wallet developers have also offered to lend their help to better address their needs as well, whom we are super grateful for!  
Would you be interested in getting your friends together for an event and he can walk you guys through it? I'm sure he would be super enthusiastic about making that happen, especially given that he has been going on about the hemp bill--attached to the rec MJ--in line to pass (fingers crossed!) today. 
Both Veronica and Edgar have been rather adamant in servicing the Hemp industry first and foremost, but we think that educating the MJ industry and offering them as many options is also critical--after all, Veronica started of in MJ. 
We are also getting ready to launch a GHC based webinar services where we will address these critical topics and provide an array of other focus points.
Let us know and get in touch if you decide to do it, as I know Edgar will be visiting family in CA soon; so maybe we can set something up if you're so inclined. 
Thanks for reaching out!

Very good question, and we are specifically targeting our current clientèle, and those that have since reached out this year, about the benefits of a closed eco-system. The ideal situation is that they see BTC as an end, rather than a means, and some are very receptive to that message--especially when they are able to track the increase of value of their holdings in BTC over time. 
The two recent rises resulted in a flood of calls/emails asking how this could be achieved and if there was some accounting error.
Its still going to take some time, but we feel the challenges we have overcome thus far and those we have yet to encounter will be worth the time and resources invested once we get it right.

Simply because you personally have no utility for it does not mean it doesn't have actual worth; some people value their time far more than their expendable income. We deal with a few of them on a regular basis, so rather than going to the trouble of getting coins via an exchange with privacy intrusions, delays, closures, or outright goxxing its best to present as many options as possible. 
If Coinbase and Circle are the extremes of the intrusive side then Swish is the middle ground, whereas Mycelium trader and Local Bitcoins are the extreme of the privacy side. Options are key here.
With that said, Mycelium has a myriad of products and services which are placing them above any other wallet out there on Android or iOS, in both ease of use as well as add-on services. I'm super excited what's to come.

Rather than address your condescending remark like-wise, I'd rather take this opportunity to direct your attention to the following video in which Farmer's using BTC in [Argentina, while it too was undergoing economic crisis, were able to serve their community](
The point here is that their currency would at least remain $6 in BTC and not be subject to the hyper-inflation that the Bolivar is and will likely further devalue if they can even redeem them before Thursday when they no longer will accept them, though I suppose an alt currency could be utilized if its at least convertible to BTC to lower tx costs/time; second, this could ensure that the local community understand its clientèle and encourages them to get involved in establishing food security via community gardens and CSA models, thus likely to not use pesticides/artificial fertilizers as they can see the impact to their local water sources and their clients health and the Earth upon which they cultivate.
Lastly, Human suffering could be reduced (albeit never fully eradicated, though) in so far as that Individual Autonomy and community strength and bonds could return where they are currently diffused to the State, which in turn results in wide spread Human suffering as we have witnessed countless times since 2008, but perhaps most notably throughout Human History.

I'm not sure if anyone noticed the following article in the subtext of the article posted, which is far more severe:


According to these reports, a humanitarian crisis has just unfolded due to family's being unable to feed their children and are having to give them away; if there was ever a basis for why crypto-currency and a local based food supply was needed: this is it--mind you this has occurred elsewhere since 2008 as well. 
The novel point is that Venezuela is one of the most resource rich nations on this planet due to its massive oil reserves, and yet the populace have been forced to succumb to such drastic measures due to the hyperinflation by the State. 
We really need to come together as a community and stop dwelling on internal bickering, and non-issue matters like Ver's lack of moral character and start building the infrastructure that the World needs.

No, absolutely not; there are definitely challenges present when conveying this technology to a larger (often not technical) audience, but I speak from experience (look us up): this is not the case. Calculus, Physics, Astronomy, Bio-Chemistry all have the same challenges but are grasped by a large enough contingent of Humanity to warrant that it is not a discipline to be understood by only a 'chosen' few technorati. 
What is more prevalent, is people assuming they know how to teach and effectively communicate to another from what is either a very narrow understanding of the mechanics and tech, or an altogether too complex and arcane position of it altogether--I too often get told to stay on 'the basics' when discussing the matter.
This was a personal failure of mine, not their's, even to this day I often have to revert to being as cogent as possible for the sake of the listener; we are too quick to negate that we didn't all just jump in and on Day One immediately comprehend the remarkable nature of a PoW system capable of creating a decentralized incentivized network that solved what was thought to be unsolvable (the Byzentine General's problem) through a complex distributed trust-less p2p network and was recorded on an immutable public ledger maintained by a series of interconnected nodes and miners. (To most that's just a 'word salad' of seemingly incoherent terms strung together and just confuses the listener.)
At least I certainly as hell didn't, it took time and a lot of personal research that persists to this day, but what we fail to do as we enthusiastically try to *inform* (read: convert) others is to take our time and take a more nuanced contextual approach to informing said audience. Through the use of adaptive learning, and the use of incorporating well understood concepts into our narrative, and ultimately demoing the tech you get much further than citing your favorite parts of the White paper(s) to a new person. 
Its really hard to grasp at times, I mainly focused and practiced my discourse online (forums/IRC/this sub) and not IRL in the first few years, so it took me a year or so before I realized what I was doing was initially engaging an audience with a presumption of knowledge or interest they didn't have; so more often than not I just led them down a path off-putting slanted rhetoric to those who bothered to stay and listen as I just went on for an hour and half on details, as their eyes glossed over, and delved into the minutia of what underlies the network (and I still didn't grasp all of it) and the myriad of possible implications and advances to come. I could often hook them back with some topic or another, but, I soon realized something: to truly reach my audience and to make them aware of why it personally matters to them with relevant use-cases was far more vital than going on about my personal reverence for the complex, yet equally refined and elegant nature of something like the LN on Layer 2--to do otherwise was self-serving, and not at all productive. 
So to summarize: knowing your audience is critical, understanding their motivation(s) and over-all technological understanding of such matters is fundamental; failure to understand those and not plan accordingly when speaking is a personal failure on the communicator, not the audience.

There was this movie on Sundance about the last days of the apartheid or in Zimbabwe (I can't recall exactly) told through the lens of French and Dutch farmers, do you happen to know the name of that film? I really would like to have another watch after all these years. 
S. Africa is no joke, I know the Rainbow Nation rhetoric was simplified window dressing for a much more complex problem, but what is bringing this about? Why are they nationalizing farmer's land? 
I remember sitting across someone at a dinner table (2013?) raving about how it had turned a new leaf and the sales of tractors was an indication of stability for farming in the region... I didn't buy it, Johannesburg has a reputation for going on the deep end every few years. 
This news, while sad, doesn't surprise me, unfortunately.
