Forks are very common in the open source space. Users are free to clone a piece of software, make any changes they please and release it out to the wild.
There have already been houndreds, if not thousands, of different forks of Bitcoin, they are called altcoins.
The reason why 21 are ever going to be mined is because Satoshi needed a number at that time. 21 made sense to him, and he used it.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:47:58
Fast(er) and cheap(er) than bitcoin is literally what every other altcoin that came before bch can do. All of them.
So in that part, bch is not new. It is the latest in a long series of altcoins.

Mostly because you can enjoy financial sovereighnity.
Bitcoin is sound money that can be sent over the internet, unlike fiat, which is just ones and zeros in a cenrally controlled ledger, and in order for you to move it you have to have a permit by the central bnk, commercial bank or the local government
Most of the users are targeting at the so called "moon".
This is a subjective point in time where it is not worth it to "cash out" as you say, rather just use it directly.

Because according to your logic they did. 
Are all the Nike buyers chinese,  samsung buyers koreans,  mercedes buyers germans? 
Stereotyping entire cultures is racist by definition. 
Your wordings just show your ideas. 
Admit you are a racist fuck,  and as i already said,  please fuck off.

He does not mean it like that. 
What he says is "if according to the r/btc people,  BCH is the original bitcoin as they say,  then why do the same people support the 2X position?"
If you take walk on the other side you'll see some of the most vocal bch supporters now are rooting for 2X
After this blows over and the attempt fails,  they will ferociously support the next scheme that will be put forward.

OP i dont mean to sound aggressive,  but if you are going to bitcoin,  do it right. 
The bare minimum behaviour of a user should be to try to keep up with the ecosystem
Multibit is not actively supported anymore,  get those coins out of there,  check the multibit site now OP
Paper wallets are great,  inexpensive and perfect for cold storage. 
You need to become familiar with live linux OS,  i personally use Tails OS,  on an encrypted usb for these things

Pool operator based in China does not mean that all its customers are Chinese. 
Mining hardware made in China does not mean it is all bought up by Chinese. 
Apple computers are made in china and my nikes are made in china,  is every Apple user or every Nike buyer chinese? 
Are you stupid,  or plain dumb? 
Also,  did i even imply i am a liberal?

It is as simple as that.  S2X will go the bch way,  used only by a minority,  and only until the next fork comes up.
Nodes are antiS2X,  it is supported by a few companies only,  has no developers and no usecases except for buying backdoored miners from the guy that made the bch airdrop a reality
Bitcoin eats forks for breakfast

Wow there cowboy,  hold your ignorant horses. 
If you were born after the 50's, you were born in a world that has massively profited from NASA's work. 
Hell,  you are using machines and infrastructure that was partly developed thanks to their work,  just for making this ignorant comment

Get a job and after that is secured look into getting a place to stay.
After you manage to pay for living expenses and roof out of your pocket, then you can start thinking about throwing what you can afford to lose into bitcoin.
Maybe get a job that pays in bitcoin, or use bitwage to convert part of your salary in btc

Nah, OP you must be new here, because that is actually a real tweet:

I am not in disagreement in regards to the malice behind bch/bcc and the way it came to be. 
Just pointing out that other projects attempted to piggyback on btc in the past
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:47:27
lel,  if you think that you need a billion USD for having a say,  you are doing bitcoin wrong.
