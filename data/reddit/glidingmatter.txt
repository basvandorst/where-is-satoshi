You're right. Sorry for the confusion. That doesn't negate the fact though that at least 1/3 of largest wallets were created in 2017.
I would be very curious to hear someone's explanation of this.

Is it not somewhat concerning that the largest wallet in all of Bitcoin might be pumped artificially via Tether?

Thoughts on how this effects whether or not I should buy more btc today?

This seems a little bit inadequate

Really interesting. But it makes sense to me that gold would be worth significantly more, even if btc has intrinsic properties that make it more useful in many cases.
Regardless, I think the physical element of gold - and that these physical elements have value beyond a store of currency - will keep it far more valuable than btc for a long time, as long as I can see in the future. At least for most of the world.
I am admittedly new to the crypto space, but one thing I am sensing from this very intelligent community, is that there is an assumption that the rest of humanity is somehow immediately willing to accept and embrace sweeping technological changes in the financial sector. I would have to disagree. I love the idea of crypto, but I can't see this being implemented on a mass scale in quite some time, if ever in some cases. This community is in a very small minority of people embracing the technology and wanting to adopt it in their daily lives. The other people betting on btc is just purely for speculative purposes. But the latter group is the one that is adding the value to the currency right now. 
From time I've spent living in west Africa and the Middle East - and seeing how the majority of the world lives - I really can't see btc having mass adoption anytime soon. Gold incredibly valuable anywhere you go on this planet. It's unique because all of civilization gives it value. I cannot see btc having the same appeal anytime soon, if ever. I know that we're moving towards a globalized world, but most people live in a setting in which they don't need the luxury of having to transfer money instantaneously around the world. That's only a privilege a small minority of this world wants or needs.

Would love to hear the "how" if you're interested in sharing
