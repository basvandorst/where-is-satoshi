My 13-year old kid has built his own 2 Mh rig on his own for altcoins... Monitoring and maintaining his rig... Converting into BTC his earnings, writing java program for monitoring and sending notifications when cgminer is down... helping me with prof monitoring for multi-coin pools (yevych.com/poolStats.html)... Just did his science project about btc... Got 85% and made me happy :-)... 
Kids at his age are more computer literate than most of the adult population.... Bitcoin technology is their future...

I apologize if it came across as the insult - it was directed to initial post and people who stating something that they have no clue about. Having said this  do realize that people come to conclusion based on info that they have

I usually ignore people at Fuck-level ... but you can read :-)
Those two are crooks and running totalitarian/stalin regimes

Feeling will go up to support mining - the best case scenario. The worst case -  bitcoin will DIE.

Bitcoin like a stock of very junior mining company exploring for gold... Might discover big or end- up broke... If it's not accepted by most - it nothing but a bit of memory... The technology itself what is really amazing

I am Ukrainian; but I am not saying you should donate or should not - it is your choice based on information you have... and what I can say from the comments that I read - most of you have no clue who is right and who is wrong. If you have a bit of brain to analyze - you will realize that this is fight of Ukrainian people against former totalitarian/corrupted regime that was inherited from Soviet Union.
What I like about Bitcoin... it gives me a freedom to help my friends almost instantly; and I am happy to use my freedom to support freedom.

I am not aware of this and do not believe it is true. US has already enough to fund... their military, wars in Iraq, Afganistan, medicare, their banks, etc... 
But Ukrainian do appreciate US support on political arena.

Mining is the rat race now... Buy bitcoins instead

Excellent post! In Bitcoin we trust!

Might be good for bitcoin... With more sanctions against Russians banks and their riches... Their people will need some other ways to transfer money abroad ... Nobody wants to keep money in Russia - even those that suck Putin's dick. Russia will never be a fully democratic and stable country... The corruption in their DNA

Bitcoin is not sustainable because of the electricity that it needs to keep it alive. I would go for something like NXT
