there needs to be something on r/bitmarket that I can buy for 0.01 BTC and it would be worth it. A business of lightweight hand-mades like esty where nothing is more than a single BTC. This way I could spend my Bitcents on something other than gambling sites and pyramid schemes... 
or anything really of value that is worthy of my Bitcents.
