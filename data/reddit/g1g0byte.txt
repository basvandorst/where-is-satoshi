Hmm I'll need to look into both of those problems but I'm not so worried about 'advances thiefs', or bad firmware as my bitcoin will still be retrievable in worst case scenarios
Edit: autocorrect

You can withdraw coins to your wallet for basically no fees and I think the security will be better.

The Bitcoin Standard is a great one! It talks about the history of money, economics, revolutions, and the soundness of money.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:42:53
Na I think $1.50. Down vote me if you want but it's the truth &gt;:D

What service are you using in the picture?
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:15:49
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:28:24
Okay thank you for the opinion. Will probably do It then :D

I use the blockfolio app for tracking my investments and it automatically does this! Highly recommend it
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:06:06
While you can sometimes snag some free crypto theres a lot of scams so be careful out there
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:11:15
Hey do you have a pcpartpicker list? I'd like too see the specs :D
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:14:42
1. No the actual bitcoins are stored on the blockchain, what hardware wallets do is they keep the private keys private and offline.
2. Yes all transactions have fees. Use segwit addreses to reduce fees :)
3. Don't know enough
4. It is safe when connected to your computer but I'm pretty sure it never connects to the internet, or the private keys don't anyway which is the main thing.
5.yes it is very easy to setup, takes maybe 15 minutes and theres plenty of tutorials on YouTube.
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:24:23
I'm basically 50/50 on eth and btc.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:59:15
Air drops are one. I think blockchain.com gives away $40 of stellar/XLM for KYC although I'm not sure if it was only for a certain amount of time.

Do many of your employees want to be paid in crypto? May I ask what sector your business is in?
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:25:52
I've been reading about SegWit and it seems great! My bitcoin is stored in legacy wallets though and was wondering if it is worth it and safe to transfer them over to SegWit addreses. Ive heard some people say it's still not safe to use them but that might be from a while ago?
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:12:04
Think I heard they're adding this in the next update :)
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:45:10
Yep. Wanted to splurge on building a new pc last year but managed to get myself to invest instead, so glad :)
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:39:55
We can also back them up for him :)

Are you a ledger owner yourself?
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:45:46
Ok thank you, let me know if your problem is resolved!
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:04:14
Great achievement :D
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:29:23
it might be a bit paranoid but its better to be safe so that hackers don't sniff you out :D
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:48:52
They have a thing called 'Coinbase Earn' on their site
@_date: 2019-03-04 12:40:57
don't know why they limit but yes the limit increases by 5 every day.
@_date: 2019-03-06 08:00:36
Correct that's a better way :)
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:53:10
I like it! It would also be easy to write as it's just two triangles, just start from the middle, go down, complete the triangle and do the top one.
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:01:35
Yes it's what crypto exchanges should be. Decentralised, doesn't take your keys.
@_date: 2019-03-05 17:42:18
Yeah that's also a good way but using the way I described you don't need to take your pen of the paper
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:15:18
I think he might mean the company 'blockchain', the wallet?
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:09:47
I like 'The Modern Investor' on YouTube. He's always making videos on news and tries to be as neutral as possible while being transparent.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:19:55
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:04:55
He predicted monero!
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:20:15
Sounds alright I'll check it out thank you :)
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:12:17
Are there any good alternatives?
@_date: 2019-02-28 19:54:19
Isn't it a decentralised exchange? Does it allow fiat on-ramping??
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:58:41
If when you say 'low rate' you mean a lower price then yes you get more bitcoin for your money, meaning more profit
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:07:36
The one thing I want to know but can't find is can you use credit/debit cards or only bank? If it doesn't then it's a deal breaker :( would be sad it looks really good.
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:25:20
For your safety I'd remove the number of bitcoins from the title
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:10:11
Thanks I'll check them out
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:27:19
You can buy the very top and the very bottom with ease!
@_date: 2019-02-26 07:28:45
Idk but here's an article that you might find useful. I think most people go for bitpay as well.
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:18:57
Pretty sure Shopify only lets you use bitpay or coinbase commerce

@_date: 2019-02-27 21:06:29
Wow that first comment
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:26:47
Ksat's makes sense
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:25:39
Yeh but youd use a new adress
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:48:41
But does having a tiny amount say 100 satoshis affect how much my node is capable of doing
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:10:14
Not at all, that's why you back up your seeds. You'd just go to your hardware wallet software and recover your wallet by using the 24 word.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:33:30
Aren't tx fees 1 satoshi or below? Anyways I wouldn't think people would be buying anything for $0.0015 XD
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:28:46
Wow thank you XD
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:03:32
so if i have a node with 1 btc locked up does that mean only transaction below 1 btc are routed through?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:46:28
Thanks a lot :D
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:14:22
Yeah it would be wiser to use a new adress but I doubt someone on the street would scan your code while you're having a coffee and try to get your private key out of you :D
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:11:36
Trezor One or Ledger nano S? I see you use and reccomend a trezor could you please share why?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:39:27
may I also ask if it is safe to run a node? I think I've heard people say that it is risky to hold funds on the lightning network?
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:22:09
Good point
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:06:31
Ahhh ok, thank you
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:38:40
Ooh forgot about that, thanks. I am planning on running a node soon with $30.
