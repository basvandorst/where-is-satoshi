I know.  the small percentage I have that are fake are bots.  But like I said in my original post, 99% of this sham Fork the Banks account are fake.  Thousands of them.  And the guy already admitted to it.

Yes. When I get a new follower, I obsessively look at each profile to see how influential they are, if they would make for a good partner in some fashion, etc.  
PS, the guy already admitted to having fake followers.   Read the thread.

They're a total fucking sham.  8K twitter likes and 99% of them are fake.

Ambiguous and icon/logo design do not go together.

How do you explain your 8.3K twitter followers but 99% are fake?  
@_date: 2015-09-20 02:35:00
Hate to say it but you're not "skilled in PR and media."  You tried to use someone to pull one over on the public and it backfired. And now you're calling this community the Daily Gossip rap.  Classy!
It's obvious Abigail doesn't want to work with you.  Stop implying that she would.  This is quite possibly the worst PR reply I have ever read.  You're a sham.

You were one of the people pretending that you "found" some of the artwork.

Everything you post leads to more skepticism.  Save some face by posting your "99 artists and 99 musicians."  We'll be waiting.

So you're trusting this guy instead.

You don't have many artists. If you do, why don't you list them? You post under pseudonyms on r/bitcoin and then claim "look what I stumbled upon..." when of course it's you who posted it.
Look, if you're trying to drum up publicity for your upcoming art show or whatever, just focus on making good art. You don't need to scheme others. Focus on making a good product.
edit: Just saw that 99% of their 8.3K twitter followers are fake.  These guys are a sham.

Also posting that you ["spotted"]( what is actually your own artwork?  
Why should we believe you on anything else?

You're a sham.  8000+ twitter likes and you've been around for 2 months. 99% of your followers are fake.
Posts about your art are always someone who happened to "stumble across their work in London" when it's obviously you or your friend posting it.
I'm calling you out because your response in the main AbbyBitcoin thread was condescending and manipulative. 
Look, ForktheBanks. You have an art show coming up that you're involved in. We get it. You're trying to make a name for yourself and get publicity for it. But the right way to go about doing it is to just make good art.
PS, 99 artists my ass. Prove it.

This isn't true.  You can easily buy fake followers through fiverr and other services.  I have two twitter accounts.  My personal and business one and a very small percentage are fake.
