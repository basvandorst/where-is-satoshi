I’ll buy at the dip. I’ve been saving 500 bucks to invest for a few months now. Should be able to get me one of those megabit coins everyone talks about.

Echo... echo... echo.
Bitcoin is speculative.
If you got in at 10 bucks or 100 bucks you’d be laughing. Until you see a recession bitcoin will hover around 5k. Look for the presidential election in 2020 to see where bitcoin is at. If Donald Trump keeps making the right moves the dollar won’t crash. I think if you can afford to stay into bitcoin till the next recession like 2008 you’ll make a profit. Don’t hold out until 1 million because it probably won’t come. Sell during times of uncertainty in the American Dollar then buy back in when bitcoin drops. Spend the profit and rebuy back into bitcoin with the principle.

Pump and dump is the game of bitcoin. You’ll see the true value of bitcoin when the last one is mined. Until then it’s speculative.

Pump and dump stock is all that bitcoin is. Until every bitcoin is mined no one knows what it’ll be.

Who benefits from fines? The government. It’s a tax break in the making. Same with tariffs. The government is in a “trade war” but it’s really just a fancy way to disguise a tax.

Bitcoin is a rich mans game. He fucks with the market and buys when you guys are complaining and sweating it. Then it shoots back up and sells it. George Soros is an enemy to the bitcoin community. Believe me that man can make bitcoin go down to next to zero.

According to this sub you just buy it and hodl it. You never sell until you have enough money to buy a Lambo.

I’m routing for you trust me. Fiat currency and the Fed needs to be shut down. Israel owns the Fed which makes Americans their slaves so to speak. Hopefully bitcoin turns into the OG greenback.

No but gold took labour to get out of the ground and doesn’t tarnish or disappear. I’m not trying to be an asshole I’m just saying just because you want something more than anything or anyone else doesn’t make it so.

This is just a pit. Stop. Still investing.

I’m not trying to hurt anyone’s feelings I’m just saying it’s a tool for rich people to get a good return by manipulating the news and media. Some people are buying 2 bitcoins and watching it every hour of the day. I’m not saying it’s going to go down to 5 bucks but it’s certainly not going to go to like 100k. You can live in a house. You can’t live in a bitcoin. If you made the government less powerful and corrupt then bitcoin would go up. But there’s no sign of a deflated government in the coming years.

It was a pump and dump scheme. The rich took advantage of the hype. Why people think bitcoin is worth 10k but others are worth 5 bucks is beyond me. It’s a money laundering scheme. You need a way to offload a couple million dollars but don’t want the government to know about it? Put it in bitcoin. Oh you want to make 10% return on your money. Put it in bitcoin and pump up bitcoin for that week and sell. Bitcoin isn’t for the poor like you and I. You can’t expect something that doesn’t get a human to get off their ass and start a company and hire people, or alternatively you give them money to make them more efficient by improving their work output. To make you money. It’s an imaginary number on a screen just like fiat money. The difference is fiat currency has police and judges to collect on their debts. Bitcoin doesn’t.

Bitcoin is a way to move large amounts of money from country to country. It’s also a way to obtain money from people who don’t have a pile of disposable income. It’s essentially a pump and dump and laundering currency.
