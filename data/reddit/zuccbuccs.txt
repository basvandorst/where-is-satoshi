Hold up, are you proposing something similar to the "buy gold coins on a credit card from the US treasury and then sell the gold coins to the bank at cost" thing that people used to do to churn credit card points?
I'm 100% listening if you've found a way to do this with bitcoin. Please say more.

Estimate 135 days left and present value of 9300
value\_EOY  = (value\_present)\*(1+interest rate)\^(number of days)
value\_EOY = (9300)\*(1.01)\^(135) 
value\_EOY = \~35,600

Two quick thoughts from me, both regarding GlobalCoin:
1. I think someone should prepare an infographic with a compare/contrast on GlobalCoin and realCrypto for tomorrow. We need to make sure this is the top comment when this hits etc...
2. I think there's a strong need to start using kiloSatoshis or mBTC in the very near future. There's lots of research on the importance of price splitting in the equities market and, in brief, people aren't as rationale as you might believe. I worry that misinformed users might compare a '$1 ZuckBuck from a company they trust' against a '$10,000 Bitcoin users by hackers scammers and drug-dealers' and question why they would want half a bitcoin rather than 5000 ZuckBucks.

(Assuming US tax resident)
Taxes are pretty straight-forward. You just pay a flat % of capital gains so these scenarios would almost wash (you’d earn slightly more in scenario 2 so you’d pay slightly more but still come out ahead).
Only reason to do this would be:
a) if you expect to earn &gt;$400k in taxable income in a future year, you could potentially avoid the higher marginal rate
b) if you expect the 2020 administration to levy a higher or more progressive capital gains tax, you could potentially avoid a higher average rate
