I welcome any feedback I can get on the site! I'm fairly new to the whole subject, but I got hooked after watching a talk on Youtube by Andreas Antonopoulos. I started telling/boring my friends and colleagues about bitoin. There biggest criticism was that there is no where to spend it. The directory came about as a result of their concerns.

I have done this myself. A tad expensive but works very well. Great way to start off buying Bitcoin with minimum hassle. Thanks for sharing!

I don't understand why people just downvote something here and not comment on what it is that they don't like about the post/link

That's a really nice site you have there, and cool products. I would love you to add it to the shopping/jewellery category here:  it's free.
Thanks, and all the best.
