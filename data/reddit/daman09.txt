You're trying to point out a logical inconsistency that isn't there.
Bitcoin in 2009 -&gt; could have been more than a speculative asset

I am serious.  Bitcoin will only ever be a speculative asset at this point

It was a federal court with a federal judge appointed to a federal position by the president of the United States.  The only thing this had to do with California is where the physical court was located.

Fuck this asshole

So what does that have to do with California exactly?  I'm sure you have very developed critical thinking skills.

Feel free to move to a place where there aren't any taxes.  Somalia sounds great this time of year.

Can't wait for the crash because of too many hard nipples, then I'm going to buy big into BTC. ;)

If you buy, then it will dip
