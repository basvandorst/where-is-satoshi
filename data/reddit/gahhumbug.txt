Yeah, I know, but I figured that if I had BTC-thieving malware it would've acted already...

Ok, thanks to everyone for the answers. Greatly appreciated!

I doubt that'll ever happen. There are emails between him and Hal Finney in the 1990s where "Szabo" discusses the use of web pseudonyms and mentions that "Nick Szabo" is a pseudonym.
Dude obviously wants his privacy; he's been using that name, yet remaining anonymous, for about 20 years already.
EDIT: It wasn't Hal Finney he was corresponding with in the discussion I recalled (though they were also in correspondence around this time):


distracted by the continual need to avoid leaving pointers to my
True Name lying around -- excess mail to/from my True Name, shared 
files, common peculiarities (eg misspellings in written text), traceable 
logins, etc.   The penet.fi site explicitly maintains a list of pointers 
to the original address.  All kinds of security controls -- crypto, access, 
information, inference -- have to be continually on my mind when using 
pseudonymous accounts.  The hazards are everywhere.  With our current 
tools it's practically impossible to maintain an active pseudonym for a 
long period of time against a sufficiently determined opponent, and
quite a hassle to maintain even a modicum of decent security.  Pointers
to info and/or tools to enable the establishment and maintenance of a 
net.nym, beyond the standard cypherpunks PGP/remailer fare with which 
I'm now familiar, greatly appreciated.  Especially nice would be a list 
of commercial net providers that allow pseudonymous accounts.


is entry.  If most people are blocking posts from new pseudonyms, how 
does one get a new reputation established?   I've had several years
to establish a net.reputation for "Nick Szabo", and it
might take a long time for any of my pseudonyms to catch up.

This is actually good news.

Nice, now you have to convince him to hold them, and not just cash out to USD immediately. Trust is important.

Any reports of this being exploited? And will deleting the browser history resolve this (provided that the key hasn't been stolen in the interim)?

I've been waiting for this all morning. I first bought some BTC a year ago now and stored it on Blockchain.info paper wallets. I didn't do this the "secure" way: I used a 3-year old web-connected iMac and a wifi-capable printer (though I used USB for printing the wallets). I spread the BTC across 6 different paper wallets on 3 different Blockchain.info wallets. Now, I occasionally have pangs of paranoia that this was an insecure way to do it and consider moving the coins to a more secure paper wallet. The BTC is still there, so does the end justify my (relatively insecure) means? Or should I nonetheless consider moving the BTC?

But are your dice fair!?!?!?
