Wtf idiot logic is that? 
It's the job of a "fact" provider to prove said statement. Keep blindly believing anything that is said to you by your corrupt media and government. But i bet thats easy for you religous bunch.

In what way is Julian Assange a shitbag human?

All lies.
And shut it with your "loyal to your country" bs.
Why should anyone be loyal to their country.
Your country is literally cancer to this world.

You did not provide any facts, just speaking out of your rear.
Typical american news consumer.

Are you guys serious.... Once as much transactions start to flow in as it did in the end of 2017, then the fees will rise to the roof again. Fees are only low until blocks are not full. Bitcoin still has 1 mb blocks.

From scammer perspective all you need is someone to sell you those hard-fork coins. Others buying is not necessary.
But yea, I see the problem with it now and agree with your post overall.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:25:43
Yes, definently!

So basicly this kind of universal replay-protection that requires main chain to upgrade only once and all following hard-forks would not share their transactions is at the moment not possible?
Well that settles it. Obviously cannot expect main-chain to upgrade after each fork.


Ideally from the main-chain point of view, I would not care about transaction copied from main-chain to hard-fork, but about transactions copied from hard-fork to main-chain. So two-way replay-protection would be hard-fork's choice.

In the light of multiple forks and semi-successful one BCH. people can easily be influenced into selling their hard-fork coins which you can buy. As long the buying price is smaller than original chain, you are winning?
Thats why it's weird that replay-protection is not forced. Maybe it's not possible, would like to know that,

True, it relies entirely on the stupidity of an Bitcoin owner.
Most owners probably don't have enough time for research and don't know much about the technology and the risks.
But my overall point is - would't universal replay-protection stop anyone from scamming that way? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:04:41
Ok, so some greasy big popular companies with a lot of support can still easily manipulate people into using their hard-fork.
I still feel like i'ts too easy to steal peoples money and some universal replay-protection is required.

Thank you for the answers!


But aren't you also protecting your own chain?

Thank you for a reply!
So basicly even one person can run new client and cause the split?
