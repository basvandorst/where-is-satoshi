We're talking about what would happen if the USPS disappeared.
If they disappeared, those 500 million packages and pieces of mail (mostly junk mail, I remind you) would not get delivered - but the people sending and receiving them would *still* want them delivered, would ultimately *still* be in demand for that service.
Fortunately for them, there are a couple of large, experienced organizations that exist that *already perform this service* on continental scale:  United Parcel Service, and Federal Express.  There are others.  I'm suggesting that, if, in the hypothetical disappearance of the Post Office *tomorrow*, UPS and FedEx would move to satisfy the supply vacuum caused by their disappearance, and in pretty short order.  It's not as if people would just shrug and be like, "Well, the Post Office is gone, I guess *we just can't deliver packages and mail anymore!*"
THAT's truly fascinating logic, right there.

That's nice.  It was a pretty popular service, though, suggesting that others *were* amenable to a company opening *their* mail.  Should their opinions not matter?

I read your entire post.  Why you think that invalidates my case, or Outbox's business model - especially when people *were* signing contracts that basically amounted to "I authorize Outbox Inc. to open my mail and scan it to their servers" *and paying Outbox to do it*.

Labor costs, mostly.  I think that the fact that UPS and FedEx aren't tied to a (boat anchor) of a union that protects non-productive employees with *incredibly* generous compensation would result in greater savings than subsidization offers.  Additionally, expansion of economies of scale would further put downward pressure on the price of *package* delivery.  If the USPS disappeared tomorrow, UPS and FedEx (and others) *would* expand their logistics capabilities (vehicles, warehouses, sorting facilities - *their* economies of scale) to fill that vacuum.
Flat mail would probably increase in price, but this is largely because it's a legacy function that people have almost universally abandoned as a means of communication.  It would still exist (for the off-occasions in which a physical original is required), but I highly doubt it would be profitable to carry a letter to a destination for $0.42 at current (and declining) demand rates.  This is a good thing.  Using vehicles, fuel, and infrastructure to deliver information that can be sent in less than a second over packet-switched data networks is a waste of resources.
The Post Office survives entirely by delivering junk mail that nobody wants, and which *is* environmentally harmful.  If that market were dictated and financed by *actual* consumer demand rather than artificial state monopoly, junk mail would almost all but disappear.  It's possible that the junk mail providers would pay the private carriers to do their bidding, but they'd have to be getting enough bites from their wide net to pay for it - and if the cost of flats went *up*, as I suspect it would (even for bulk buyers like junk mailers), it may well eliminate that, and at the very least would significantly reduce it.
Real shit, like retail catalogs and pizza coupons may well survive the higher prices.

If the USPS vanished tomorrow, prices would get really high... for about six months, while UPS and FedEx and DHL scrambled to capture the market vacuum.  Afterwards, they'd probably fall to *at least* the same level (I think *almost certainly* lower), and life would go on.  
Junk mail would probably, for the most part, decline significantly.

But, if the USPS vanished, they absolutely would.  Consumers demand shipping.  They will pay for it.  UPS, Fedex, and the rest would gladly rise to the challenge.


Of course they do.  If they did it themselves, they'd face higher costs, since they're not being subsidized.


There's a very big reason:
Tl,dr - it is illegal for any entity other than the United States Post Office to deliver letters.

You're like, the second person who's responded to this and said, "Well, *I* would ________."  Well, that's fine man, but *plenty of people disagreed with you*, and were delighted to have no more piles of paper getting shoveled onto the doorstep by the Post Office.
And, of course, that was the rub - Outbox eliminated junk mail from people's lives, saving time and frustration for people.  But, it also cut into the bread and butter of the Post Office, so it had to die.

I don't have a problem with unions, per se.  I have a problem with unions that frantically protect shitty workers and make outrageous, unrealistic demands of their parent organization.  When their parent organization is the government, unions go hog wild - and this is evident in the Post Office.  There are dozens of do-nothing "managers" at my local Post Office, promoted to those positions because they were long-time postal workers that transferred from one Post Office to another and the receiving office didn't have their position open for them.  Additionally, there are plenty of long-time postal workers who will just call in "sick" two, three days a week, and the Post Office can't do anything about it, because they've been there so long and the union will throw a shitstorm if any disciplinary action has been taken.
UPS actually makes a profit, so I strongly doubt that their union is nearly that bad.  It helps when your union is aware that the company actually has to make the bottom line work, whereas the USPS union can basically be certain of a taxpayer bailout if/when shit goes south.

What exactly is the problem with his logic?  I send *one* thing in the mail regularly:  My rent check.  I wouldn't have to if my landlord weren't an 80 year old who I'm not going to bitch to to accept Google Wallet.
The USPS *lives* on junk mail.  The majority of their existence is supported by a service that nobody wants (and in fact actively deplores), that is in its own right an environmental catastrophe.  I'm failing to see the fault in his logic.  Yours, on the other hand...

I agree.  I also think that this is a good thing, generally.  Electronic data networks exist - by and large, *you do not need* to physically send "small parcels" anymore.  For the off occasion in which you MUST send a document hard copy, I don't think it would be an unreasonable cost.
Small packages I suspect they absolutely could do at competitive rates.

On the contrary, I've heard that argument.  I don't think it has merits.  If you live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, you made the choice to do so.  Costs increase as a result of that choice.  The idea that the rest of society should subsidize that choice, a choice *largely* made by pretty wealthy landowners, is patently absurd.  They could pay the higher costs to have packages delivered to them, and thanks to wireless and satellite internet services, they could also enjoy routine communications with the rest of society.


Yes, that's the *only* reason those addresses get mail delivery.  Because someone wrote down on a piece of paper 240 years ago that the USPS is required to deliver to them.  That magically solved the logistics and resource requirements to actually make that happen in a way that *nothing* else could, am I understanding you correctly?

Boy, you sure dismantled his argument.  By calling him stupid.  10/10, pro debater.

^ this
Remember when the U.S. Post Office killed Outbox, because it was an existential threat to that so-highly-demanded junk mail consumers just can't get enough of?  But please, tell me how environmentally friendly the government is - delivering paper to my house just because.
