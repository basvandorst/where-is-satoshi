Very much this. Have had it happen. Not much fun when you switch over to a new class-C and find out your mail-server's address is on every blacklist out there. Had to run everything through the secondary until I got that fixed.
 
I'm not sure but it seems to me that AT&amp;T is one of those companies that provides you with a contact method when they reject your connection so worth checking the logs too.
Oh, as for only the family using it, got to watch that. One of out users got phished and their account was used for sending spam, getting our server on blacklists again and causing problems for several thousand other users. Added some rate limiting and alerts after that.

The wallet needs to be separate from the node anyway. It's not a required part of running a node. Definitely the GUI should be separate.
Ideally you'd run the bitcoind full time in the background as a service so that it was always up-to-date. When you wanted to use a wallet, you would launch it as a separate application and it would talk to the node.
Currently the wallet is built into the node but you could have the GUI as an application which manipulated the wallet through RPC calls. Then you could have the GUI do whatever you wanted and this is a lot simpler than patching core.

I'm not leveling criticism anywhere (hence my use of "may") but sometimes it's better that someone is paid for doing a job.

@_date: 2015-06-26 02:09:29
Yeah, but it's not redundant. If it's downloading a chunk of data from node A and it's slow, it won't connect to node B and start downloading some of the chunk from there, it will just wait for node A to finish. It may well download a different chunk from B but that doesn't get the slow chunk loaded more quickly. At least that's the state of play last I heard, it's possible it's been updated.

There are a few aspects at play here.
Somewhere out there, someone did a quite complex analysis of how pictures could be combined with QR codes. The takeaway appeared to be that you need the registration marks (the squares) and a pretty small area at the middle of each "pixel". This is obviously dependent on the QR reader software but would appear to make sense.
Then there is how much the QR code can be distorted. This is obviously software dependent but it seemed that the QR code recognition was sensitive to shear and bending but somewhat OK with being keystoned.
Then there are the acceptable levels of dark &amp; light. I haven't seen anything solid on this but you'll need some level of contrast. I believe that inverse QR codes are not acceptable. Light and dark colors can be substituted for black &amp; white though.
Then there is error correction. QR codes are resilient against a certain level of "damage" to the data pixels (not so much to the registration marks) and this can be set when the QR code is generated. This allows you to overlay some picture over the QR code and may help with some disguise.
Edit: It also seems to me that the registration marks do not need to be square. So that could be an option too.
This is just my understanding and there may be some misapprehension in there but I hope it helps. Also bear in mind that it depends very much on the software and some techniques may be acceptable to some readers and not others.

No. The governments' war on cash is nothing to do with Bitcoin. They'd be happier with us having all our money in banks where they can monitor an control it how they will and it is clear that several steps along this road have been taken already (government confiscation of gold, AML laws, restrictions on cash purchases over certain amounts and actual announcements of consideration of abolishing cash).
Bitcoin is a potential answer to that. Though I am aware of the suggestions that it was government created and a single global currency *is* a little one-world-orderey. I am of the opinion that it is a good thing overall.
To be clear, I'm not against banking or electronic transactions, I use them all the time. I am just concerned with the push for control that is occuring.
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:46:58
You seem to have a weak grasp of the definition of "fiat".
Gold's value is subjective, not intrinsic but that doesn't make it fiat. And before you jump into rhetorical acrobatics, that will not make it so either.
Bear in mind that the dollar was originally tied to gold. So the government said "Here, take this green bit of paper, it's the equivalent of gold". That's where the fiat comes from. Bitcoin (and gold) have not had that, their value comes from price discovery mechanisms.

I agree. Ideally such an association would be semi-independent but funded by many Bitcoin organizations and companies rather than be a board of company bigwigs (several of whom got themselves into various kinds of trouble).

Possible interesting option would be to have an app that requests the use of the camera and then detects a modulated IR signal that signals the phone to check a URL which then feeds the Bitcoin to the address.
Bonus points then if you allow the user to feed their own Bitcoin address to the app instead of using one generated by the app.

I think the main objection I saw to this last time this came up is that connecting nodes cannot handle a slow connection gracefully. They need to either reject the connection and try a faster one or download other parts of the data in parallel from another source.

sophisticated supercomputer-based applications.
SGI and Cloudcroft have worked together with SGI’s flagship ICE platform for powerful distributed=memory
supercomputers to build Sukuriputo Okane, Cloudcroft’s first supercomputer currently
ranked  in the world. You can find more information about SGI’s ICE supercomputing platform
here: 
This super computer was tuned to 939.67 TFlops which would see it pushed into the Top 100 systems
in the Top 500 HPC realm. This could have only been achieved through commitment to cooperation.
SGI is very pleased with this alliance in pushing the boundaries of distributed-memory systems.
Next we must perfect the integration of Nvidia Tesla and Intel Xeon Phi accelerator cards to reach
new heights in supercomputing excellence in Australia. SGI offers both accelerator options for its
products thus working with Cloudcroft to ensure the next supercomputer stays green, reaches the

I think part of the problem is there is a dichotomy between running a full client and running a lightweight one. If you run a full client, the lightweight ones that are out there will not talk to it (though I believe the API would allow this). So if you have a lightweight client, it becomes fairly pointless running a full client.
It would be nice to see a lightweight client that talked back to a full client that individual users could run instead of relying on the wallet provider.

Prices changing is the biggest issue. However, if Bitcoin stabilizes at slightly deflationary, this is not a concern for the seller and the buyer can decide if it is worth the extra cost. The new item would arrive with a new, slightly cheaper re-order code. The seller could also keep track of any overpayment and credit/refund the buyer.
With the price of Bitcoin as it is right now though, it's not really viable. Good thought though.

The only way to really email bitcoin is to send a private key. Otherwise, you are simply using a third-party service (which is perfectly valid).
It might be interesting to have an API for a wallet that would accept a bitcoin address and initiate a transaction of a pre-defined amount. Again, that really wouldn't be sending bitcoin by email but would avoid using a third-party service.

No, the question is do we let the market wash out the bad actors and move to better actors for a better, faster recovery or just hand over a bunch of taxpayers money which drags out the recovery and allows the same old crappy actors to hold on to the jobs they should rightfully have lost.
You could argue that but you could also argue a lot of wrong things.

No. As others have said, Bitcoin is built on computer science but the *ideals* it embodies are economic in nature: Sound money, supply and demand, fungibility, trustless transmission and so forth.
Nothing about the computer science of Bitcoin is new. It was built from well-established building blocks. Some of which have won awards of their own, FWIW.
What you're saying is like that the Mona Lisa is about the chemistry of the pigments and the physics of how the light interacts with them.
I do think it's a bit early to be awarding an economics nobel to Bitcoin though. I have no doubt that it will prove to deserve one but I'd be happier to see it actually prove itself first. If it gets awarded one now, it's because it's a nice idea. If it gets awarded one later, it's cause it's proven all that Keynesian stuff for the bullshit it is.
As for your assertion that eceonomics is a pseudoscience, I'd agree that a lot of economics being done these days is pseudoscience. But that doesn't mean economics itself is. There is pseudoscience being done in the natural sciences also but it is easier to pick out because of the rigorous background practitioners in those sciences tend to have. Potentially, economics could have a renaissance that would cause it to move towards a more rigorous paradigm. Bitcoin could even be the catalyst for that. That would most certainly be deserving of an award, I would think.

Exactly the point. Some people in this thread seem to think that children are born with full cognitive abilities and just need some education shoveling into them. The point of this video is to show a cognitive change over a certain age gap.
The title of the video even shows that it is not about the ability to compare things measured in different ways but about *conservation*.  That something doesn't change just because it is presented differently. Without careful measurement, it would be tricky to tell if the tall glass had more or less but that it was just tipped from exactly the same glass and previously looked exactly the same means it is still the same.
I guess the point of this video being on thus subreddit is to show that for some people, they are unable to transfer those cognitive skills to a new area and fall back on simplified the simplified metrics of early childhood on things they do not understand. This explains a lot, especially about the economic system, actually.

This is a good point. Places like London and New York are big financial centers because they are close to the money trough (London and DC) of government and thus are bound to the fiat currencies that those governments control.
Not that there shouldn't be such a place in New York (or London etc), just that the Bitcoin ecosystem is likely to be more decentralized and if one place becomes the place to be, it is likely to be somewhere else.

Because the federal government is supposed to be an association of ~~sovereign~~ states and is *limited in its powers by its constitution.
Your state government is also closer to you and thus should be more responsive to changes that the population desires.

I have been keeping up with Bitcoin since 2012 and so, of course, insisted that we take Bitcoin (though not exclusively). Prices are still in USD but we will be using the Mycelium wallet and converting USD to BTC at checkout. We will be accepting Bitcoin directly and not exchanging to USD. 
I thought it might be good to solicit discussion from the community about ideas and advice wrt Bitcoin (Though bear in mind, I'm no noob). This might be useful for others who are thinking of going in the same or similar direction.
To be honest, I am not expecting to see much use of it at this stage. We are in a fairly small, quite provincial town. But any chance to move things forward has to be a good thing in my book. We are not doing this just for the novelty value.

The big deal with Gox and the signer malleability (that was claimed) was this, if I recall correctly.
* Gox sends money to X. The transaction ID (Call it T1) of the transaction is calculated and recorded for evidence of the spend.
* X (or cohorts) recreates the transaction and alters it slightly. The transaction ID (call it T2) is now different but because of the malleability bug, the transaction is still valid. This transaction makes it on to the blockchain because (reasons).
* X receives money from transaction T2, contacts Gox and says "Hey look, your payment, T1 never made it on to the blockchain. You still owe me"
* Gox issues a new transaction.
Even very shortly after Gox presented this excuse, it was quite clearly bullshit designed to distract us from the man behind the curtain.
It would be nice if SW fixed signer malleability (in that two transactions with identical outcomes could not have the same txid though that would likely be difficult) but if it fixes the non-signer malleability, that's a good thing.

Those that can't are not running sustainably. 0.8 is nearly four versions behind (0.12.0 is all but here)
In many cases, if you really need an old version (which will be the case for a vanishingly small number), all that is required is to download the appropriate version of the code, patch the block size limit and recompile.
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:43:16

Interesting enough. There are other numbers I would like to know but I fear there is no way to divine them and any speculation would be exactly that. I would bet that many nodes remain at older versions because they are abandoned, unmaintained or non-critical.
I understand why Bitcoin doesn't auto-update but it would be interesting if there was some way for it to signal that it was "locked" to a particular version and its maintainer was not just lollygagging on doing the update

Neither does Bitcoin except for some specific consensus rules. An SMTP operator who suddenly changed to port 825 would find themselves somewhat all alone whereas a bitcoin implementation which added, oh, say some block compression scheme could still work fine on the Bitcoin network. There have also **evolved** some consensus idea about anti-spam measures, configuring servers as non-relaying for external IPs and so forth. It has also **evolved** (unfortunately, some would say) beyond the original ascii-only model that it started out with. There's a reason we still have SMTP while other options have fallen by the wayside (hint: It's ability to adapt)
I'm not saying it's perfect or even a good analogy to Bitcoin but it does have some merit.

They are voluntarily here and can leave at any time if they feel it suits their interests. The whole point of a decentralized, peer to peer currency. It doesn't surprise me that you are a collectivist though. You really are in for that rough ride I mentioned.
"The community" just describes a bunch of people who share common ideas. Those ideas have diverged and we effectively have two communities (helped along by the moderation policies on this sub) and two consensuses (three if you count those who got fed up and left). It's only natural that they will go their own ways.
I believe Bitcoin fails if it remains as restricted as it is. That is not in my interest. Using Bitcoin is not a suicide pact. That is why I support big blocks. And I believe more and more are seeing it that way.

Haha, it really should not. (Well, maybe a little bit because it is ugly but not for your reasons)
The balance of the wallet is returned as a Decimal object. As the wallet has a zero balance, it is returned as 0.00000000 (0 to 8 decimal places to match the 10^8 divisibility of a bitcoin). So it is, indeed, exact and precise as you (and, indeed, I) would demand.
Unfortunately, when converting to a string, Decimal apparently uses scientific notation for values smaller than 10^-6 at that level of precision, hence 0E08. I'm not sure how I'm going to handle this yet, if there's an elegant way in Python but I'm thinking I might just treat 0 as a special case and convert anything else to satoshis and do string manipulation for the decimal point.

So mostly it's going to be cleaning up, commenting, error detection and stuff. I'll try not to do too much before I go github but I have my pride :)
It's currently two programs, a cron job which periodically fetches the data and the display generator which runs in a fairly short (should be shorter) loop.
I have a few other things I might try and get in there but that's for phase 2.
I'm thinking I might just go ahead and rsync the whole blockchain over from my other node now. Just finally ticked over into 2013. We'll see how it's doing after a night of sleep and a workday.

No, I think you're totally right about it needing to be decentralized. The content is good for sure but things like the comments, the monetizing and the google+ strong-arming all indicate problems with the model. There should be a way to provide content, get paid for it but have others be able to design the portal experience that leads you there. Want a site that reviews and present dubstep/garage mashup videos? Sure thing. Design the site but link in the videos from the decentralized service.

Because it implies no meddling. There's nothing special about the number as such.
Which is to say, if there were, say 1% deflation, it wouldn't be justified to print money just to bring inflation back to 0.
Now, in practical terms, actually printing cash (paper and metal tokens) to replace that which has become lost or destroyed makes some sense but that wouldn't apply to Bitcoin and is not good as monetary policy.

What I want to know is how deterministic wallets decide they have calculated enough addresses to check. What I read seems a bit vague on that.
I mean, you could keep checking new addresses until, say, ten unused addresses have been generated but what if you created a bunch of addresses and ten of them in a row have not been funded? How can it know to check the 11th?
(To be clear, I know a wallet in itself could keep track of all the addresses it had given out but what if you're regenerating a wallet from the seed?)
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:03:15
That hard-fork indicates the real problems with running a homogeneous monoculture ecosystem which in turn comes from everything being concentrated in a "core" distribution. We really need to move away from that whole model. Bitcoin should not have been tied to any particular database in the first place (and it's ridiculous that it's still version locked to BDB 4.8)

You don't have to own something to use it. If someone offered a service whereby you could post a magnet link on a webform and the relevant files turned up in an s3fs bucket, you'd still be using bittorrent, just not directly.

What I'm reading: "We want centralized control to ensure decentralization".
This is what decentralization looks like. It's not just down to the anointed ones to make decisions for everyone. There's a reason (in my opinion) that Satoshi has remained quiet. He knows that anything he says would give undue weight to one party or another and that is not how Bitcoin is supposed to work.

No, I just hate going around in circles. You specified that you like inflation because it forces money into the economy and I explained that forcing things causes malinvestment. If you still don't understand why. I will tell you what I thought was obvious which is that it short-circuits the thought and consideration that people would otherwise put into where to put their money.
This is even quite apart from the fact that inflation involves taking money from the economy and giving it to the pals of the government.

Who determines that it is not necessary? That is exactly the point.
No one really wants to ditch the core dev team. Personally, I think they have done a fantastic job to date and we all owe them quite a lot. However, they are human and may make flawed decisions and are subject to biases, external pressures and vested interests. So am I, so is Mike Hearn and so is everyone else. That is why Bitcoin works the way it does and to see it in action is actually pretty cool.

Cause something happens and they go bankrupt or y'know want to retire and so become a burden on the state (other people).
Savings is how we are supposed to look out for our future and, traditionally was the way other people and companies acquired funding for things and ventures (by borrowing from the bank the savings were made at rather than being magiced up by the central bank to profit only bankers).
Additionally, someone who "hoards" their money (putting it under the mattress as opposed to saving) is withholding their claim on resources from the economy. This allows others to obtain those resources for cheaper and likely make better use of them. Financially bludgeoning them into expending that hoarded capital is likely to make them spend it in a wasteful and inefficient manner and raise costs for others.
And actually, screw you, it's their money. What you'd "much rather" they do with it is irrelevant. Take care of your own finances, not mine. No wonder we need Bitcoin.

I can't. Nor can some suit sitting up in Washington. That's what the market does.
(almost missed your first point. As the Bitcoin economy matures, it will develop a loan market)
Now, let's explore the hoarding thing a little. Let's say I have two bitcoins and you have one. I am hoarding my bitcoins because I see no good investment opportunities. There is a general contractor we'll call Jim. You have a great idea for a building, it will bring jobs to the area, make local businesses more efficient and maybe even cure cancer. Jim wants a bitcoin to build the building, it gets built and things are great.
Now, instead of me hoarding my two bitcoins, the government, by whatever manner incentivizes me to spend my bitcoins. I don't really want to, I'd rather save them to do something useful but someone thinks I need to be providing liquidity to the economy. So I turn to Jim and hire him to build me a swimming pool or a statue of Keynes or something. You've already offered him a bitcoin for his labor but I'm *really* incentivized so I offer him 1.2. In this example, you're out. The world doesn't get a building that improves the world, it gets an ugly statue instead.
There are parts of this that can be adjusted one way or the other but the simple point is that malinvestment is bad for the economy as it denies resources to good investments and inflation incentivizes malinvestment.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:47:16

Yeah. I'd have to say that from what I've seen of informed comments on this sub, it leans heavily towards larger blocksize with those who are against coming from a small hardcore group. Now that could be my bias and if not, it could be that it doesn't really represent opinion on the ground and even it does, that doesn't necessarily translate to a majority (or the 75%) following a fork to larger blocks. But if not, that's fine. That's the point of the consensus after all. I find saying "It's not going to happen so I'm not going to allow discussion of it happening" to be very disingenuous.

"Enough" people need to have a "fast enough" connection to support a sufficient level of decentralization (for whatever that means). That there are people on 1200 dialup or others able to download the entire blockchain in a femtosecond is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:15:26
How about we let the market decide without imposing artificial restrictions.
Any discussion about decentralization cannot take place without recognizing that the block reward, which as any of us knows, is scheduled to be phased out, hugely distorts the market.

I'd bet real bitcoins there's a UPnP client for Linux that would let you do it. However, the few routers I've been on didn't have UPnP enabled by default.
One issue anyway is that even without port forwarding, running a node dings my internet connection. With it on, many complaints from the family. I'm thinking of cutting down the maxconnections.
One of the reasons for wanting to go to the pi for me is that I hope to switch on the port forwarding again but limit the bandwidth the device can use.
Here is a UPnP mapper. It's in Java which is not particularly ideal for a Pi.
To your point though, I don't believe that core does UPnP so you are correct that more instructions are needed.

Whenever I have used a safe deposit box (not mine but work related), no bank employees have been present (beyond that they do some security stuff then disappear). Of course, this may vary between countries (and maybe banks). So yes, this would require bank officials (or possibly some government brownshirt) monitoring what you are up to.
Staying away might be an option but it would probably not be beyond belief for the government to require the opening of lock-boxes for anyone who might be suspected of holding cash.

He is correct. In fact, fractional reserve means that they cannot lend out all of it but have to keep some fraction in reserve. So perhaps they can only lend out 90,000.
Where the creation of money comes in is that the next borrower deposits the 90,000 and that can be lent out again and so on. Also, banks can borrow from the central banks (at low interest rates) which is not "real" money.
There is nothing really wrong with fractional reserve banking as such though. Only that people don't really understand what's going on (they should watch "It's a Wonderful Life")  and that accounting practices mean that the lent money is counted in the wrong way.

The bitcoin api is pretty well documented and you can pull out all the transactions as needed and just parse through them.
This is some hastily written code that looks up some transactions in Perl.
    
      use JSON::RPC::Client;
      use Data::Dumper;
 
      our $client = new JSON::RPC::Client;
 
      $client-&gt;ua-&gt;credentials(
         'localhost:8332', 'jsonrpc', 'user' =&gt; 'pass'  # REPLACE WITH YOUR bitcoin.conf rpcuser/rpcpassword
          );
      my $result=docall ('getblockcount',[]);
      print Dumper($result); 
      $blockcount=$result;
      my $block=$blockcount-1;
      $block=1;
      my $result=docall ('getblockhash',[$block]);
      print Dumper($result); 
      my $hash=$result;
      my $result=docall ('getblock',[$hash]);
      print Dumper($result); 
      print "===
";
      my $txs=$result-&gt;{'tx'};
      print Dumper(
      foreach $txid(
        print "T:$txid
";    
        my $result=docall ('getrawtransaction',[$txid,1]);
        print Dumper($result);
      }
      print "XXX
";
      $txid='59bd7b2cff5da929581fc9fef31a2fba14508f1477e366befb1eb42a8810a000';
        my $result=docall ('getrawtransaction',[$txid,1]);
        print Dumper($result);
    sub docall{
      my  $call=shift;
      my $x=shift;
      our $client;
      my $uri = '
      my $obj = {
          method  =&gt; $call,
          params  =&gt; $x,
       };
 
      my $res = $client-&gt;call( $uri, $obj );
 
      if ($res){
          if ($res-&gt;is_error) { print "Error : ", $res-&gt;error_message;         }
          else { return $res-&gt;result; }
      } else {
          print $client-&gt;status_line;
      }
    }
From here, it's just adding a for loop on a bunch of blocks and some conditionals on the raw transaction and some comments and tidying.
If you're planning on doing it often, you might want to stuff the output into a text file or database to streamline things.

My primary issue is that they have tied things to a specific version for "portability". That is almost the definition of not portable. Having thought about it more, using a database is fine (preferably decoupling it to be implementation agnostic) but the "wallet" should be stored or exportable in an open format.
Basically, a *portable* wallet needs to be in an open format, *not* subject to internal implementation details of an arbitrarily chosen piece of software. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
Edit: It seems that pywallet is able to open a core wallet and export it to JSON. Perhaps that functionality should be integrated to the main client and the pywallet JSON adopted as a standard?

Not very rigorously defined but saving could be considered as entrusting one's capital to another and hoarding as withholding where it cannot be used.
The important thing to bear in mind is that in the case of fiat, that capital is simply tokens. The actual resources are still out there to be used.

Probably a better experiment would be to have people "earn" a reward in some way such that they might reasonably be expecting to receive something of nominal value. Another would be to vary the reward since people are likely to think that a high value item is some kind of trick (which it may well have been if he wasn't actually giving them out. People could have been suspecting he would renege, making them look foolish and greedy).
A better comparison might be to see whether people would take a paper dollar or a silver quarter (currently worth around $2.80) 
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:03:34
The problem with self-interest currently is that that means going for the prize of the block reward as quickly as possible and *not* picking up the meager transaction fees.

Every time miners mine a block, they get to split the reward. At each halving, that reward is cut in half. Currently, there are 3600 bitcoins mined every day. At the halving, that drops to 1800.
Theoretically, this cuts the supply of Bitcoins and could lead to a price rise. There are some who believe this will already be priced in and others who have other reasons to be skeptical. The last halving occurred somewhat adjacent to a bubble but it's up to you whether you think that's a coincidence or cause-and-effect.
It also has other effects such as suddenly making mining unprofitable for a lot of people. The net effect if people behave sanely (not everyone does) is that miners get switched off until mining becomes profitable again.

I don't know. Expecting everyone to sit around, singing Kumbya and magically coming to a consensus on how to run things seems more like magical thinking to me.
Satoshi broadly built the protocol to be responsive to market forces. From my point of view, that's one of the most far-sighted things he possibly could have done. People will pull in the direction of their best interests and those that don't will fall by the wayside (or have an epiphany).

It's a learning curve. There's no reason to wait for more than 1 confirmation (or even none, really) for anything that can be revoked. So if you have shipping latency or, as you say, VPN services, you may as well accept the transaction on a contingency basis.
If you're buying a donut in a store, it's a little different, of course. We could end up with additional services for that but more likely, if things get that far, stores will just take the risk (or are we really thinking that double spending will be rampant?).
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:29:23
That's a fair question.
You are correct that that parameter means that they could be out by quite a lot. However, there are several things that make me fairly confident in believing that the timestamps will typically be fairly accurate.
Firstly, there are quite a few different groups solving blocks. One entity could be quite wrong but all of them is unlikely. This is good enough for my purposes.
Secondly, most OSs use NTP these days. You would almost have to go out of your way to make the timestamps inaccurate.
Thirdly, while times may drift a bit, that rule you quoted above means that if you get too far out, all that time your pool spent mining a block could be wasted. This is an incentive for the pool to keep accurate time and for miners to notice if the pool is not keeping accurate time.
It might be interesting to track the accuracy. I have no access to historical data but I could check new blocks. It would be subject to network latency of course and probably the time it takes bitcoin-qt to verify a block. In fact, it might be a good way to measure that if it's assumed that at least some pools have accurate time.

Yes, the merchant pays for it, It's a cost of doing business and like other costs, ends up being passed on to the customer in the price of the goods and/or services being sold. This is why cost-of-living is so different between NY, NY and a small town in KY for example. Lower costs mean savings for customers or that the merchant is able to be more competitive in other areas.
The credit card companies have tried to suppress price differences between paying cash and using a card but it's still there in quite a few cases, particularly if you ask.

True, difficulty changes will tend to push things back towards ten minutes and I *had* neglected to account for that but mining has continued to push ahead of difficulty and our current average since the last halving is currently running at around 580 seconds or a smidge over 3% fast. That's a non-negligible difference. Enough to put the next halving at 2016-7-16 7:52:24
Recent averages might also prove useful as it would be possible to see how far ahead (or behind) of the original estimation things are getting. If it is shorter than the long-term average, it could mean that mining is getting ahead of difficulty increases and *accelerating*. My node is now caught up on the blockchain so I might make a graph.

There's no reason for miners to expect 25+ BTC per block though. When the block reward halves, miners should switch off their equipment until the remaining miners are competitive again.

How so? Using real data rather than an approximate guess?
Now, there may be some fluctuations as a result of short or long block finding times but it would be more accurate in general. It might not even be unreasonable to use the last 100 blocks which would be slower to change (and so more stable but slower to account for a real hashing power change).
Edit: I forgot about difficulty adjustments which may cause recent estimations to be inaccurate.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:54:37
Nope, it makes this harder and more expensive.
IMO, there's a good chance this is being done by someone who wants to see the block size increased. It's too risky and expensive for someone who just wants to troll or push the price down but someone who has a genuine interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and who has quite a few might be willing to take the hit to move things forward.

Well, the point is that artificially limiting the block size is a central decision on the value of bandwidth and disk space. That's a decision that should be left to the people providing it (the miners).
Like in the old Soviet Union, where bread was 5c but you had to stand in line for 2 hours to get any. Prices and scarcity should be determined by the market, not by decree ("by fiat" if you will).
Your suggestion about the soft limits is correct, I believe. Though I think a simple doubling would be adequate for now, I think ideally it would be removed completely.
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:06:09

It just depends which definition you want to use. If you just want to look at how many total bitcoins have been mined, inflation is around 10% but if you consider that many, many bitcoins have been lost or are otherwise not available, the increase in the money supply could be counted even higher. That actually makes our current price stagnation even more impressive.
A similar effect explains why QE is not (yet) producing the inflation that it should be (they are paying the banks to keep it to themselves)

Oh, I'm not saying the banks would have done it already. I'm just saying that if they became convinced they needed something like XRP (which they well may not), they would commission their own version of it and make sure they were in control.

Meh, it's not a call back to the whitepaper for authority, just for a factual description for how the protocol is governed (voting with hashpower).

What is embarassing, for you, is that you have used words that I didn't in order to attempt to show me as wrong. This is what is known as a "straw man" argument.
2x is, indeed, not locked in. This is one of the (several) reasons I opposed it. It can be backed out of by those who would be happy to renege on the NY agreement (several of whom have shown an inability to act in good faith previously). It is, however, activated for all the pathetically weak guarantees that provides. And for anyone with honor, backing out of the hard-fork part should also imply backing out of the soft-fork part.

That will be tempered as alternatives are become more economical (not aluminum wiring again though, please) but it's just hard to predict where things will go.
You're spot on about the dollar though.

Yeah, it's perfectly adequate (perhaps over-so) but you have the comms issue with the host. The pi has ethernet and can USB host but the first is risky from an attack vector point of view and the latter not so useful.

Officially 3%. Arguably actually anywhere from 6% and up as the government doesn't include some quite important indicators in their calculations (and fiddles things in other ways also).
3% doesn't seem like much but it soon compounds. At 6%, prices nearly double over the course of a decade.

There used to be faucets but they have mostly dried up. Blockchain.info gives out cards which will get you about $1 worth of bitcoin when you open a wallet with them.

Interest rates are currently extremely low. If you put your money in a straight savings account, it will earn next to zero interest (inflation is officially at 3% and likely closer to 6%*). So there is no encouragement to save money. Conversely, the cost of debt is low, mortgages at 3-4% car loans at 0%. This encourages debt.
Inflation causes low interest rates because in the absence of inflation, borrowing has to be from savings and investments. Inflation is provided by creating money and providing it to banks to lend out. More money to lend out, the less you charge for borrowing it, hence low interest. It's all quite insidious and destructive to civil society.

Interesting. I had a quick look. It looks like they don't use Openstreetmap (no reason why they should, of course but it makes it a bit proprietary), they appear to be some businesses which aren't on there and I'm not sure that Captain D's should really be listed because you can buy cards from Gyft and use them there (Presumably there are other places like this listed too). 
I'm a little concerned at any pressure there might be between their directory and their payment service. But that's likely just my cynical nature. Thanks though.

They've moved to *mask* the damage. The funds still disappear into the pockets of scammers but the buyer is somewhat protected (the merchant often is not though).

Fractional reserve is not really a problem if it is made clear that when you deposit money, you are investing and your funds are at risk.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:26:25
Sure. But I think there were really three things that contributed to faucets drying up.
The first is that the price started rising. Suddenly it wasn't play money any more. This can be compensated for by adjusting the amount given away, as you say.
Secondly, the faucets were being gamed. Again, moreso as price and adoption increased. You can protect against that somewhat but it ends up becoming more trouble than it's worth.
Thirdly the supply of free Bitcoins has pretty much dried up. Time was you could fire up your CPU and GPU and bitcoins came in which you could give away. Now mining is a commercial enterprise and if you want to give away bitcoins, you're going to have to buy them just like anybody else.
It might be interesting to set up something that gave away bitcoins that was funded by advertising on the site. Ideally it could be fully automated with the income from the advertising going directly to the giveaway bucket. That might not be able to generate enough interest to keep going though.
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:56:32
That's not quite how fractional reserve banking works. It's a common misconception, I used to believe it myself.
If a bank has fractional reserve requirements of 10% and it has 10,000 in deposits, it can lend 9,000.
Of course, it can also borrow money from the central bank which brings in all kinds of complications.
@_date: 2015-04-21 00:00:58
I have read though your other postings in this thread and I mostly agree with what you say but I want to look at this a little more closely:


I would suggest that the *perceived* amount of money is larger. This is because the wrong things are being added together. I like to use, by way of example, the riddle of the old ladies and the radio:




The solution to this riddle exposes the same flaw that the money creation and money multiplier complaints about FRB contain, that the wrong numbers are being added. This is mostly due to the lie that if you deposit $10, you have $10 "in the bank". The bank *owes* you $10 but that money has been lent out to someone else.
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:37:54
Nah. I live in the US but until recently had income in the UK. Transferring money by bank transfer internationally is incredibly bad value due to exchange rate spreads and fees and you get no chance to time the market (which I suspect the bank also takes advantage of)
Peer to peer exchange either directly (as currencyfair once offered) or via Bitcoin offers a substantial value proposition.
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:15:59

@_date: 2015-09-03 13:47:24
Don't think currency, think programmable self-fulfilling contracts. Say you want to buy some stocks for 10BTC, you could enter the condition as part of the transaction. If the stocks get transferred to you, the transaction executes. The person who is selling the stocks can transfer them to you knowing that the 10BTC is guaranteed once they do so so zero risk to either party. Going even further, the transaction itself could be the record of the transfer with no external database needed.
I'm a little skeptical myself (tradition is a hard thing to go against) but the things that are *possible* are actually pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-09-24 03:06:49


No. If someone comes up with the same recipe as coke, coke has no action they can take (Though a patent would have long expired). That is far from a monopoly. Poor example anyway as the taste is a matter of preference and lack of ability to reproduce the flavor of a soft drink is not exactly impeding technological progress or causing anyone much of a problem.
There is no doubt that certain aspects of patents are highly damaging. The question is whether the alleged benefits outweigh the downsides and, perhaps more importantly, whether the two can be separated and the downsides eliminated whilst still keeping the claimed benefits.

It's a matter of semantics but given that the way to earn bitcoins is to provide goods or services and that its management (mining and confirming transactions) are encouraged by direct financial reward, I'd say it's much closer than any fiat currency provided by even the most free market governments that we have.

It depends, in a free market, inflation could fluctuate a fair bit (even to negative) and still be "moderate" but in an otherwise healthy economy, I think under 1% would be reasonable.

Not completely true. You could import the private key(s) and do a partial spend with the change address being the key itself.
Not necessarily a good idea and I don't know which wallets support sending change to the original address (I know mycelium does this with their pre-hd wallets) but it's theoretically possible.
Paper wallets also have the advantage that you can split your funds between several of them cheaply which in itself brings all sorts of benefits.
Not that I'm down on Trezor. I've been advocating hardware wallets for a while. If you're just going to stick it in a safety deposit box however...

There is more than one way to do it. However, I'll present one way.
* Download the page from bitaddress.org. Use it to generate and print a paper wallet. Best way is to use something like a Knoppix boot DVD on a non-networked computer with no attached storage. Make sure your printer does not store documents in any way. You can get more paranoid but this is a level I would feel comfortable with.
* Transfer funds to the wallet. Funds are now on wallet.
* When you want funds, open Mycelium. Add a new account and then create a single address account. Scan the private key from the wallet. (This is different from sweeping the funds from the wallet)
* Spend funds from the wallet. The change address will be the wallet key.
* Delete the account from Mycelium.
Note that once you import the key, you have potentially compromised it. You will have to judge your risk profile. However, this is where having multiple paper wallets comes in. 
In theory, you could import the key into a completely offline system, generate the transaction offline, transfer it to an online system in a sterile manner and inject in into the network (I believe blockchain.info allows the import but I'm not sure how you'd go about generating the transaction).
If you're happier with a bit lower security, you can generate the single address wallet on mycelium and export the private key. I was actually able to print it directly from my phone (with the help of the ZXing QR code app)

So you're saying that it's actually better for those with slow connections to be disincentivized from running a node.? :)
If there are 7000 (or any number of) nodes, each node must receive one block therefore on average, each node must send one block. Obviously there will be a distribution and you want this to run farly exponentially at first but I'd like to see some numbers on how quickly it goes, when a block is first mined from "Nobody I'm connected to has this block" for node 0 to "50% of my connections already have this block" on a downstream node to "Nobody I'm connected to needs this block I just received". I suspect there is more capacity for low-speed leech connections than one might consider at first.
I took the number 7000 from above as approximately the actual current number of nodes. If one assumes perfect distribution (each node sends to 8 other nodes which don't have the block), it takes only four iterations before more than half the nodes have that block.

That doesn't sound right as the ODA is designed (badly) for drugs that our outside the patent so that a company can be encouraged by the exclusive license to produce a drug that is otherwise in low demand.
What I read was that this drug probably wouldn't qualify but it will take a year to clear things up and in the meantime they are exclusive suppliers.
I may be wrong though as I haven't looked to closely at things myself.
Edit: Looking into it, the act is not what I thought it was but there are many articles out there relating it to the ODA so there is apparently some connection. I am not able to do any more research tonight but here is an article.

There are a couple of options. You could petition the developers (not terribly hopeful of that being effective but it might have some effect) or you could run a version of bitcoind that implements BIP101 and advertises it. This doesn't support it directly but it does show to miners that were they to also start using BIP101, their blocks would be passed around the network.

I see some problems with that article itself. "Buy low"? Sure, I'll just use my time machine to see that the price is low and is not on its way to zero or a long-term slump. He also never really addresses what DCA is supposed to address (it does not purport to allow you to out-perform the market as he appears to be claiming) and thus fails to refute it properly.
DCA surely is not ideal for every scenario (I certainly didn't use it when I jumped on NFLX when I perceived it as oversold) but it has its place.

No, because there is a dynamic equilibrium. You can't hold three variables static and consider only the fourth. There is price, there is difficulty, there is the block reward and there are transaction fees. The difficulty provides one of several very important negative feedback loops.

In fact, I'm moving my full node to Linux and not using it as a wallet going forward.

OK, SPV may have been the wrong term. I mean with a pruned blockchain. If you run bitcoind with pruning, the wallet is disabled.
Having though about it more, a wallet does need to have access to the blockchain to verify the provenance of transactions all the way back to when coins were mined. I wonder though if there would be much mileage in pruning transactions which were no longer relevant. That is, if an address is spent to 0, transactions on that address do not need to be recorded.

There's a phrase "any publicity is good publicity". I think there are limits on this but it is true that often what would appear to be bad publicity actually works for you. I think the Silk Road arrest was probably good for Bitcoin overall for example. I am not sure where this falls though.

Artificially limiting the block size leads to a sick fee market that doesn't accurately represent the dynamics of the supply and demand of the actual resources available.
So does the block reward FWIW but that's going away. However, it will go away slowly enough that there will be more than enough time for a healthy, robust fee market to develop.

The supposed issue is that they created virtual bitcoins to cover their loss. You might get away with that if things are fairly stable but with the rise in price, suddenly the bitcoins they'd "borrowed" from the ether became a lot more expensive to replace.

You're not wrong about the entropy. I've had boxes suffer entropy starvation just for doing ssh because of no keyboard or mouse attached. They've kinda fixed that now but it uses artificial sources of entropy. You could throw some of the serials from the sd card etc into the mix but that's artificial still. Possibly the best bet would be to add a truly random source of entropy like thermal noise. Shouldn't be too hard since the pins are available. Or maybe a mercury switch (shake the pi until the key is generated). I know the thermal noise has certain issues but you should be able to have adequate supervision over the hardware, I'd think.
Edit: Hmm, looks like the Pi has an onboard hardware RNG that checks out to be pretty decent.

Even with no block size limit at all, what is the incentive for miners to include fee-less transactions? Only altruism and possibly enlightened self interest. There's not much of the former and the latter will fall away with time. Eventually, miners will only include transactions which are considered worthwhile.
That is how the market works.
As for fee calculations, it's impossible to know what rules a miner might use to include transactions in a block (or, indeed, any transactions at all). It's certainly not hard to make reasonable estimations though.

You are looking at things the wrong way round. The cost of mining rises towards the reward for doing so. This is distorted somewhat due to the block reward currently but that is going away on a schedule. Just see what happens at the next halving in July.
There are many moving parts in Bitcoin and many of them affect others which in turn feed the changes back. Price drives mining but mining also somewhat affects the price (to a lesser degree)

This problem is that one miscalculation can lead to multiple charges even when logically there should only be one overdraft event. There are really three issues at play...
1)High overdraft fees. My UK bank account has a $1000 overdraft attached with high (but reasonable) interest and no fees. I rarely used it but it was nice to know it was available.
2)Structuring of debits to maximize fees. They also do this if you have overdraft protection.
3)Applying credits after debits to maximize fees (this is pretty unconscionable in my opinion.
The worst part? It's all fully automated and just numbers in a database. There's no rationale behind such things other than "because we can".

Could be an argument for the increased blocksize there.
I suspect that higher price and increased transaction fees will compensate somewhat but not sure if it will be enough. It could be very choppy water.
@_date: 2015-09-04 05:04:12
I can accept that as a position but I'm not so sure it would really play out in practice. Even if some miner happened to feed his initial block into a poorly connected node (fairly unlikely I think), the likelihood is that at least one of the next nodes will be well connected and if not, the next is 8x8=64 nodes. If a miner is really that poorly connected, he should probably be asking himself some questions. But like I say, I'd like to see some numbers. I suspect the network could support quite a high proportion of slow leech nodes. After all, bittorrent does. It's nice when there are 1000 seeds but in truth, 10-20 is usually enough to get some good download going.
I'll also add (decide the relevance) that with some trackers, it is very hard to maintain a decent seed ratio. Those with good upstream bandwidth often have very good share ratios which takes away from the ability of others to seed (since on a closed tracker, there are typically a lot fewer leachers).  That is, perhaps, getting a bit too far away from Bitcoin though.

To be fair, companies with 10 million dollar security budgets tend to get hacked because of employees who don't give a damn or who are clueless and much of that 10 million is spent in an effort to mitigate that.

Given that the halving mechanism is most likely untouchable, I guess some alteration to the difficulty calculation algorithm might be a way to go.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:49:37
All else being equal (which it is not), half the reward supports half the number of miners (or rather, half the hashing power).
Though I do see an issue in that immediately following the halving, the reward is halved but the rate at which you are rewarded will still only be proportional to your hash-rate so miners will not be profitable until the next difficulty adjustment so the sensible thing would be to switch off. Which puts the next halving even further out.
So the main hope is that the price will be high enough that miners are still profitable at 1/2 the reward. And that maybe some miners will keep mining at a loss (not a safe assumption). Also, transaction fees might rise to encourage miners to keep mining until the difficulty adjusts.
So, yes, interesting point @_date: 2015-11-29 06:40:25

This is true. Paying with a CC is trivial and they don't even require you to sign anything. A starbucks gift card means tying up funds (as you say) and either having to carry an extra bit of plastic with me for little gain (I try and keep my wallet slim) or having to fiddle with my phone.

My favorite hobby horse. Wallet.dat is a binary blob, locked to an particular version of the database library even (which causes complications when wanting to compile bitcoind for oneself). IMO, it should not be regarded as a wallet.
It *is* possible to export a platform independent copy of some of the wallet's contents but it is not complete. It would get you your funds though. I'm not sure this is available through the GUI however.

Even a (too) simple analysis would have half the miners stop mining, the block time go out to 20 minutes and the next adjustment be at 4 weeks, not six months. (though how does the difficulty adjustment align with the block reward halving anyway? I guess ideally you'd time the next adjustment to be a couple of days after the reward halves but I suspect that's not the case)
In truth though, there are a lot of moving parts that mean any disruption will be a lot less than this.

As well as vanitygen, you may also be thinking of firstbits which was a way of shortening an address by using the shortest string that would identify the first occurrence in the blockchain.
This was kind-of cool but is now pretty much defunct. Mostly, I think, cause the guy who ran the site kinda gave up on it but also for technical reasons, these aren't really good to use.
I.e. if you had the 1MyVanity78xySDfpdFfk14568kvdSfp address mentioned elsewhere, if the first occurrence of an address begging with 1MyVanity was that address, that was the firstbits. If it matched another address, however, you would have to add additional digits.
I think blockchain.info may still support this somewhat. Though I think it was a bit broken last time I tried.

I think the point is that bankers are not going to get into a mining arms race with each other as is encouraged by the Bitcoin block reward. Given that, although it may technically still be called mining, nothing like we are used to with Bitcoin is required to chain blocks in a private blockchain. Some linux virtual machine running in the cloud could do it. Perhaps one for each bank participating would do.
After all, what would be the motivation for increasing the hashing power on a private blockchain? And for any motivation, what would be the limiting factor?
I believe Bitcoin is the missing piece of the puzzle for specific circumstances. It's great. But while traditional banking might have to correct lugs for one or two of the sides, the other two are vastly different. Other solutions fill their needs and capabilities. Adopting some aspects of bitcoin (rolling historically linked checksums perhaps) could work for them but the scope is fairly narrow.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:12:17

I do think we are going to see some standard way of shortening addresses. One option, for example is the DNS system which is designed for this kind of thing. It's easy to enter a TXT record and you could have a lookup for bitcoin.chimpos.com return your address (or even generate one). I might even have a try at a service like this since HD wallets allow one to generate new addresses without being able to get the privkey.
There are security issues around DNS though. I'm sure they could be largely resolved but they do have to be accounted for.
Looks like btcaddr.es. already provides the basic service but like I say, consider the security implications.

I thought this was going to be about a literal app store. With apps purchasable with Bitcoin. Which is actually an interesting idea.

Unless I'm misunderstanding, those libraries miss the point. If everything is a wrapper around libconsensus.(o/dll), you really don't have multiple implementations of the protocol. (Not that those libraries are not a worthwhile thing to do, they just address different issues)

Yeah, if I understand your point, both sides would opt-in to a system of arbitration that they would know would be likely to be unbiased.
It wouldn't mean that things wouldn't end up in courts anyway sometimes but it would vastly cut down on the believed need to do so.

Hmm. So you're saying that it is an arbitrary decision that must not be changed.
@_date: 2015-10-08 19:33:20
I think your definition of centralization is different to mine.

We're supposed to be getting something similar at work instead of the rfid cards but no sign of a go-live yet.

Yep. And in case people aren't aware, the US govt is operating (or attempting to) extra-nationally when it comes to banking and finance these days. Some banks are telling them to piss up a rope and jettisoning all US citizens as customers but many are rolling over and complying.

I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's more of a whine than an actual barrier to adoption. Nobody really gives a damn how much energy is being used as long as it does what they want.
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:00:50
Could be. Being a little generous in your supply is probably better than getting six in the chest.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:25:08
Yep. Different people will have different valuations of things so there is no "price". In a market, the "price" is simply what the last trade people agreed to exchange something at.
If you're not in the market for something, sure it means it has much less value for you but that doesn't really mean anything about the market price.

Yeah, it's the XT side brigading and being angsty teenagers. I guess they're DDOSing their own nodes also?

OK. So you have an acre of farmable land in Kenya but the government decides that it doesn't like your sort and is going to forcibly repatriate your land and give it to descendants of the original settlers. You have 48 hours until the guys with the machetes arrive. Gather your wealth and go.
The point is, superior is relative and unless you define the context, you're just bloviating. Is farmable land superior to Bitcoin? It depends on the circumstance. You can't just flat-out assert one over the other.

2/7 actually.
If they owned 50% of the company, then 30% would be excluded leaving 20% vs 50%. So closer to 30% than 20.
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:31:50
No, it is not.
Not that I'm saying that these tools shouldn't exist and be user-friendly. They are just not an essential part of what it means to be a Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:00:38
That's good to hear. I understand why it all got lumped together but long term, it's not a good solution.
@_date: 2015-10-23 13:54:06
Only if you go for your wallet.

Signs of impending currency controls -&gt; flight from currency.
They can lock down a lot of foreign currency exchange pretty easily. Bitcoin might be a bit trickier. They were trying to get ahead of the game but possibly they decided it is better to have it all coordinated.
Or the janitor unplugged a router to use the floor polisher. Either-or.

It is not forced but it is a centrally decided change to the default. It skirts the line in my book. I don't have any objection to it in general but it leaves a funny taste.
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:58:23
This could be it. In which case, it might be interesting to see if they deposit anything. It certainly wouldn't be 4.3BTC though.
