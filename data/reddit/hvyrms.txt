Considering how many "simple" passphrases I've tried, I'm actually a little bit relieved at how "unsimple" this was.
Also, I can NOT BELIEVE that one of the passphrases was not "correct horse battery staple"

I've got a Butterflylabs Jalapeno on order, but I'm not very hopeful that I'll do more than break even on it by the time it ever arrives :)
And even if ASIC miners are reasonably priced, if they're just making you the same amount you're paying in electricity, it's just back to speculating that the price of a bitcoin is going to increase in the future.
From your link:
"You're probably aware of this, but if it costs you more in electricity to mine than the value of bitcoins you get, but you are also convinced bitcoin will rise in value in the future, then you should instead buy bitcoins now (and reduce your electricity bill)."

And I understand that, but the whole issue of these 0.001 asks being made at a slightly lower than market value and then immediately being rebought seems to be exploiting that method of valuation, yes?
I understand the current marketplaces for bitcoin are largely modeled on major stock markets and their ilk, but maybe in this lower volume setting, it's not as "hack" proof?

So much truth to that, and figuring out a way that merchants can deal with the ever changing value of a mBTC

Mostly because it'd cost me thousands and thousands of dollars to buy, build, tune and run :)
Yeah, I'm legitimately interested in this whole bitcoin business on the whole. I'm kind of gambling on it being a big thing going forward, but I just don't think that there's a chance of it being big unless it finds a new market aside from my A-D reasons in the OP.
There's a local bitcoin group that meets near my place monthly. I'm planning on going to their march meeting and chatting with some people IRL about all this.

Mine because you want to contribute to the system, not because you're looking to earn coins and make money.

Because that tip is probably more than you're going to make if you're not going to pour a lot of capital into a mining setup. :)

So, I guess my point is:
Why hire someone through jobs4bitcoin instead of anywhere else?
Why purchase things on bitmit instead of Amazon?
Why buy Reddit Gold with bitcoin instead of paypal?

That's okay, my BTC is in correcthorsebatterystaple :)

Clearly I'm not that worried if I'm playing poker with Bitcoins :)
I'm just looking at possible, worrisome scenarios over the horizon. Honestly I'm probably just half-empty about the future of Bitcoin, while you've all been replying in the half-full capacity, which is the perspective I was looking for. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 00:07:56
I don't think you or anyone would be TRYING to evade taxes. I just think that governments would see it that way. And if that becomes the case, there could be some major push-back against Bitcoin.

I legitimately stopped reading their site entirely after that whole fiasco where one of their authors got banned from commenting on their own site for using slurs against a reader/commenter.

I think your idea of Satoshi level transactions might actually be the most interesting that I've heard of yet. I can almost see Amazon latching on to that for their S3 or EC2 services and charging down to the megabyte for hosting services, or cloud computing services or whatever. Sure the savings might be minuscule for individual users, but for larger groups/corporations, it might actually be worthwhile.
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:53:49
How? Shouldn't buying something with bitcoins always be at a relative parity to buying something with USD?
Or are you meaning that if I buy 100 BTC now, I'll have the purchasing power of $10K at some point in the future?
@_date: 2013-02-21 22:47:20
I'm definitely not a normal doubter, mostly because I'm pulling for Bitcoin to make it. Where I'm struggling is that I'm looking for Bitcoin's "email" to use your analogy. I'm looking for the killer app that pushes it past the ceiling that anonymous transactions and skirting around restrictions has. 
I had a small bit of hope that the US poker players that got pushed out on Black Friday would give that boost, but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen.
I understand that we haven't gotten our Youtube or our Amazon, but I'm just trying to see if there's any sort of hint that we're going to get one of those, or if everything that's coming out is just another Kozmo.com

Were your two transactions for the same amount? A lot of times transactions can be flagged if you have "duplicate" looking transactions in quick succession (think accidentally clicking twice on a "purchase" button).

"Bitcoin will not loose value over time but gain value."
See this is where I get down on BTC. This mentality right here.
People said the same things about Blue Chip stocks, or about buying a home. This "oh, well you'll never LOSE money...." is just an outright fallacy.
There's already been a crash where bitcoin lost NINETY percent of it's value. 
I'm sorry but I don't have ABSOLUTE faith that Bitcoin will not lose value over time.

So today (4/10) is kind of the point I was worried about. If I were a business owner and I accepted your 0.01 BTC for a beer last night, I might be pretty pissed about the value I received for my product.

Okay, so, Devil's Advocate here:
Transactions being tax-free isn't a sustainable benefit of Bitcoin. If wide adoption happens, there's going to be some method that's going to pop up that will allow transactions to be taxed.
Also, I've looked into mining and it just seems like the cost of entry for being able to get ANY sort of measurable return is way too high to make it feasible for 99.9% of people now...
I'm not trying to crap on your ideas, I'm legitimately interested in discussion/argument :)
@_date: 2013-02-21 23:52:26
This is a good example, but if this becomes the situation that pushes a lot of people/businesses to move into Bitcoin, I don't forsee a situation wherein a government will NOT try to figure out a way to get their slice of tax revenue or what have you.
And I know that the whole anonymous/decentralized nature of Bitcoin is supposed to keep government or whoever from circumventing such transactions, but as much as people have the expectation that Bitcoin will thrive, I have an expectation that somehow, there will be tax revenue driven by these transactions.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:33:50
Do you think that there's enough sustained demand for avoiding regulation to keep bitcoin viable in the long term (10+ years)?
I see it as a possibility that most people who are avoiding regulation (or outright skirting legality) will use bitcoin in the short term, but eventually grow tired of it, or find some other alternative, and eventually move away from bitcoin. And if that happens, entire marketplaces might become non-viable and close.
I'm just looking for some sort of hope that there will be a reason for John Q Internet (yeah, grandmas are probably not going to be included) to be maintaining an active bitcoin wallet of a few hundred dollars (or more) and be reasonably active in using the currency.
