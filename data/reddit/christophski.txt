My friend had a similar error recently. Upgrading to the latest version of Electrum fixed it.

Spam is people taking up space in the blockchain for purposes such as deliberately raising fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:54:53
It looks like somebody dumped a huge amount of 150+ sat/byte transactions into the mempool, possibly in the hopes of increasing fees.

That defeats the point of the blockchain being permissionless though. I think there are some cryptos that provide this though

Last time I checked, a single transaction from electrum was 226 bytes non-sw, 139 bytes sw. WHich at this moment in time is £2.84 ($3.81), vs  £1.74 ($2.34)

How can you think that doing something via a for-profit market is cheaper than doing it by a for-the-people government?

It might be good to modify your original post to clarify that you are not part of the team, it seems like lots of people (myself included) are assuming so.

The post looks like an official announcement

Even if they do change it, doesn't change the fact that they put it there in the first place, meaning who knows what they will do in the future.

When did you get around to asking most people 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:44:15
How do you envision a country operating without a government or central body to plan and execute public construction etc? Genuinely curious

For eBay, isn't that basically what Paypal does anyway?
