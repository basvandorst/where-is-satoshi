They announced it here:  [ 
But it doesn't have any details about a code, strings attached for verifying ID, etc.
Looks like its a sort of "only available this day" kinda deal.

BTCRecover has the ability to run with an address database created from the full blockchain. Basically checking against every address ever used. It's surprisingly fast even compared to testing against a sickle l single address

The mempool was empty, but was just spammed. 
Will take a few days to get back to normal.

A bit of fees for moving your crypto from time to time is better than losing the lot if the exchange disappears.

Yet people still manage to send to the wrong address via typo... Non-zero chance multiplied by many notmies...

Keepkey for $5, great if you don't have a hw wallet yet (no kyc strings attached to this either, unlike the $10 ongoing deal)

Has someone done something to annoy the Bcash crowd recently...
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:26:27
Absolutely, it's a no brainer
@_date: 2019-11-28 09:00:18
There are plenty worse ones out there.
It supports everything the Trezor does (given it's a shameless trezor clone), even does Multisig better than Ledger... The support isn't great but its certainly a capable wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:29:07
Unless you are offline signing everything then this is still a large improvement, never mind the additional possibilities that having a device from a different vendor ads to a multi-sig setup.
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:08:26
This x100
Store on your wallet and only move to an exchange to trade.
Don't ever just leave it on there long term.
@_date: 2019-11-03 13:15:36
I own both and they are both good. They will protect you against malware (demo here:  and both are well supported. The secure element in the ledger isn't open source, but if you are paranoid, you can generate your own seed and use a 3rd party wallet client like Electrum. (A malicious hardware wallet basically would need to be paired with malicious software on you PC to do anything bad)
If you are starting our, then I would suggest that Ledger is probably easier to use due to it all being integrated in their "Ledger Live" desktop app. (Though the way what ledger live displays multiple transaction outputs leaves a lot to be desired, demo here:

Ellipal, Coolwallet, there are plenty others...
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:59:42
Yea I got a bunch.
I will be posting a "conversations with scammers" vid next week that covers what happened when I decided respond and have a laugh
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:33:51
Basically you have a few options.
1) Large, established and trustworthy exchange... They will want to link to bank account and do KYC... Often they provide wallet functionality too. (So you can easily store/send, have a mobile app, etc)
2) Sketchy exchange... They might happily just take your money and send to a BTC account...
3) Bitcoin ATM... Might not require any ID or bank account, but you will need to find one and also set up a wallet on your phone.
4) There are other decentralized options like Bisq that can be secure and less invasive, but generally not n00b friendly.
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:58:43
This is pretty much why I have been putting content on YouTube and targeting keywords, etc, that relates to scams. I know someone through my work who got scammed hard is a really obvious and dumb way, my question to them was basically "where did you go to learn about crypto in the first place" and their answer was YouTube... (They only asked me about stuff on person after they had been scammed...)
Unless people know some of this beforehand they are easy pickings.
@_date: 2019-08-28 04:50:52
I actually plan to demo this in a future video that explores how much damage a deliberatly malicious, side-loaded Ledger app can do...
That isn't a particular jab at ledger, but their platform makes it easier to do a proof of concept like this.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:40:03
Yep, messing up security isn't forgiving at all...
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:15:14
Just don't lose your 24 word seed or leave it lying around. That seed backup is more important than your physical ledger nano...
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:04:39
Now that you have a hardware wallet, most of the scammer threats to your coins come from people trying to trick you into handing over, or sharing your 24 word seed. (Eg: 
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:28:02
The hardware wallet never interacts directly with the internet or reveals your keys to the PC.
It is basically passed a transaction to sign, shows you some details of that tx on the screen, then allows you to confirm it.
Storing your 24 word seed in any digital way undermines much of the security that a hardware wallet offers.
@_date: 2019-08-28 03:37:08
Also true, good entropy based passphrase increases security a lot :)
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:41:54
If there is enough interest you could open a ticket on their GitHub :)
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:35:24
Might be a possibility, but you can always hold on to hope ;)
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:47:44
Use an open source hardware wallet with open source software wallet interface :)
Fully auditing a hardware device is actually really difficult, but you can compile your own software wallet or just run it directly with something like python.
Basically the hardware device calling home would need to be paired with a malicious piece of wallet software that triggered it and then sent it over the internet. (Though using hardware plus software wallet from the same vendor does make this a realistic attack vector)
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:03:10
Yep. Just because other people might think you are paranoid doesn't mean you are wrong. ;)
I also think it helps for people to better understand what goes on "behind the scenes" in their wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:12:16
Much love for all the paranoid people in infosec :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:24:33
Yea, I would suggest that coinbase is the easiest place to do that, as it will let you buy it, store it or send it all in one platform.
If you use a Bitcoin ATM or something, you will need to set up a wallet and stuff on your phone.
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:33:12
Did you panic sell for $2 ;)
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:04:53
Yea I don't know why people would do this, but I have encountered multiple people who have. They just don't know any better...
And yea, why Ledger have chosen not to highlight it in any way is anyone's guess...
@_date: 2019-08-10 01:35:56
Should I just send you my Coinbase login to make sure you send it to the right place?
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:07:04
Just for those who like to be thorough.
I have also tested the fairness of the dice with 1000 rolls, I have to say that I was impressed with how the $1 dice went when used as a group of 10 in this way. That vid will come out next week.
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:29:12
Yea it seems straight forward and is a good option. Ever since that time back in the Ledger Chrome app days that some malware was swapping the receive QR codes, my preference for the "Don't have your device" is to have the xpub in a secondary wallet like Sentinel to verify as well. (Assuming I don't check on the Ledger)
Basically for the folks who made this mistake, I asked them "why didn't you click receive" and their answer was that they wanted to save time...
@_date: 2019-10-28 02:13:31
Well done for holding your nerve and working through it with BTCRecover!
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:32:31
Like this one 
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:00:28
Hardware wallets aren't networked devices, so to say that they connect to the internet gives the wrong idea when comparing them to software wallets.
What is happening between your hardware wallet and PC is pretty much like your screen displaying a question asking you the time and you entering an answer via a keyboard, yet refusing to show your watch on a camera or to reveal its inner workings.
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:10:33
That would be the 0.01% of non scam.
@_date: 2019-08-30 21:03:30
Yea for me this video really highlights some major weaknesses in the blockchain.com wallet that pretty much makes this particular scam possible
@_date: 2019-08-25 05:06:49
Both are fine, it really comes down to which coins you intend to hold.
IMO ledger live is also more n00b friendly than the trezor approach.
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:58:09
Does sound pretty dodgy...
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:26:43
Yea, a few people actually did run into this issue. Believe it or not, its a mistake that normies make...
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:02:32
You are right in that adding a whitelisted address can prevent this if someone verifies the address correctly once. (Though they could also just add the wrong address to their whitelist...)
That said, while Coinbase was the example here, a newbie could make the same mistake for any inbound transaction that included a change address or multiple outputs.
@_date: 2019-08-27 23:02:27
Good to hear, thanks for the feedback.
I see people asking about "do I need to trust trezor to generate my seed" about once a fortnight, so thought it would be helpful.
Also just really keen for anything that helps people understand that their wallet is actually their seed... Not the physical device :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:29:42
This just looks like an Android SOC... Much like the Ellipal...
You should send one to Ledger and let them do a tear-down and test.

Best advice is to completely ignore the private messages that you get who will try to scam you with investments like in this example here:

Yea I think it's safe to round it up to 100% on Reddit too, but want to allow for a bit of hope for humanity :P
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:27:40


This is just a no-name knockoff of a Trezor One.
The Trezor One is open source, so there isn't anything wrong with that... But you might as well just buy a Trezor...
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:02:48
Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:50:03
Get a Ledger or a Trezor.
Ledger is a bit more newbie friendly, so could probably a good bet since you are asking here.
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:50:17
Just use coinbase if it's your first time

Need to add a column about whether it supports being used with a hardware wallet. (This will include Bitcoin core soonish via hwi)
Without that you are one malware breach away from losing the lot. (Demo of electrum malware vs hardware wallet here: 
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:17:53
Hardware wallet with multiple seed backups and a BIP39 passphrase is far more secure and redundant than hiding a wallet in the cloud somewhere.
It's not just about storage, but being able to spend it in a secure way too. (Eg: 
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:21:47
It is relevant in that its very possible that a Bitcoin wallet might have crappy entropy generation, leading to insecure seed generation. (This includes hardware wallets) Even if the wallet does everything else perfectly, this can be an issue...
Fortunately you can just use dice: 
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:25:38
Coolio, great work so far :)
@_date: 2019-12-11 21:56:03
Ellipal doesn't have a secure element, so you can't assume it is safe from physical attacks.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:13:35
Look at the video for how to a set of dice in a way to address this, as well as a quick test video to test the dice themselves.
If the dice are a bit unfair, just add 10% more rolls... Only do a 24 word seed, that way even if the dice are so bad as to be the same as a coin toss, you still basically have 128bits of entropy. (One of the big reasons why 24 word seeds are better than 12)
This is before you even consider mixing entropy sources
@_date: 2019-12-11 01:37:18
 Ultimately, these kinds of disclosures shouldn't be super surprising, as wallets like the Keepkey &amp; Trezor don't use a "secure-element" in their wallets, so being able to extract the key from the chip itself is basically a given. (For people who know what they are doing) That said, I think the Kraken disclosure is significant in that they have offered detailed instructions on how to do it that just about anyone could do with a few days/weeks of learning. (Even if learning from scratch) 
That said, a few diceware words is sufficient to mitigate the risk for most people to have something that needs a few millennia to break. (With the tools to do this readily available in BTCRecover) 
I put together a short guide about it back when everyone was flipping out about the Trezor/Keepkey key extraction stuff in July. 
The bonus with a BIP39 passphrase is that it adds a layer of protection to your paper seed phrase backup too.
For those who are like "oh hey this means that hardware wallets do nothing" that isn't even remotely true. They still provide a massive amount of protection from malware on your PC, malicious wallets (Demoed here:  [ ) and phishing/network attacks. (eg:  [ ) Cheap, broadly targeted, remote attacks are still a major threat for all users, with a hardware wallet with a trusted screen providing the best defense against them at this time.
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:52:36
You are right that ledger lets you store it. Ledger has a secure element so it's designed to offer far more protection than a general microcontroller. 
That said, you can also configure the Ledger so that you have to enter the passphrase manually each time on the device itself.
@_date: 2019-12-01 11:35:27
Nar that's not how this works with BTCRecover. Basically a portion of the wallet file is extracted and you test the brute force passwords against that portion. 
If you find a password that decrypts it, this same password will open the full wallet.dat
@_date: 2019-12-12 03:33:29
The hacks on the Ledger Nano were about modifying it so that the screen, button, etc, (which are driven by the MCU in the Nano S) are actually not showing you the correct information. No-one has actually demonstrated a key extraction from a Ledger Nano. In the Nano X, the secure element drives the screen and handles the button too...
Key extraction, which is what this article is about, is a totally different matter. Unless you have a secure element that is designed from the ground up by and certified to resist physical attacks, you should assume that key extraction is possible.
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:52:04
Don't use that to generate paper wallets.
Just use Ian Coleman's BIP39 and run it in an offline amnesic environment as per here: 
@_date: 2019-09-14 20:37:18
I know people who have been scammed by this stuff so if it convinced one person to pull their savings of the scam, it is worth it. :)
Unfortunately it's a bit like dealing with members of a cult, so it's hard work getting people to listen to concerns at all... Let alone reconsider their opinion of the scam.
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:27:23
Yea the title is a bit clunky...
@_date: 2019-09-15 02:28:55
Gotta love people who have found their niche in life...
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:32:53
Easy answer... SEO
Targeting all the keywords and phrases that people are using to promote the scam. When I checked, videos that just go hard against it from the start don't get the click through from those who are dabbling on the edges of the scheme...

Never mind that it is an obvious Ponzi, isn't open source and that the closest thing to a white paper reads like a bad ICO...
Looks like they are spamming them Google Play and apple store with 5 star reviews too...

Got an entire channel aimed at helping people learn and stay safe in the space...
The learning curve is very steep and the technology isn't even slightly forgiving for those trying to learn...
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:56:50
What wouod you suggest instead for someone who doesn't want to wait/pay for a replacement and doesn't have the knowledge/confidence to create a paper BIP39 wallet in an air-gapped environment?
This is the "least bad" accessible solution that will likely prevent people doing something worse.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:42:00
Depends how many shitcoins someone holds ;)
@_date: 2019-09-09 23:16:33
Agreed. 
I also can't overstate how much simpler things come with a hardware wallet... (In terms of security, backups, software stack, etc)
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:06:18
Stay safe :)
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:50:07
Yea, the main thing I was looking for was a systemic bias across all 10, but it's also just to help people to not uncritically accept whatever method of entropy they are using.
Basically there was a post from Bitcoin talk a few years ago that was really critical of people uncritically using a coin flip to create their keys. (Found it 
Just wanting to be thorough :)
@_date: 2019-09-07 11:02:38
Fortunately for you, Bitconnect coin is a bargain at 50c now ;)
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:09:58
It is annoying, but for me this is a big part is why I have a hardware wallet as it adds a very strong layer of protection against software threats.
Video of malware vs hardware wallet here: 
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:05:56
Good to see that you were consistent and used more than 1 dice.
Simply using a bunch of dice at once, and being consistent and impartial in the roll/read, introduces an entire additional dimension to the outcomes such that, as long as they don't all have the same exact bias, the unfairness can basically average itself out.
@_date: 2019-09-11 05:36:40






Yep that is obviously true.
So for someone who is looking to move to a new seed or has lost theirs and wants access in a hurry, what are you suggesting instead as an interim step? (Specifically,  What would you suggest instead for someone who doesn't want to wait/pay for a replacement and doesn't have the knowledge/confidence to create a paper BIP39 wallet in an air-gapped environment? )
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:13:18
Yea I originally did have bunch of content in there that looked at statistical stuff, looked at how many standard deviations from the mean, etc, but basically showed it to a couple of people who were bored/confused by it almost immediately, but did understand the graph. (This is why it's a really short video) The assumption that I was seeking to disprove was that all of the dice were identical and suffered from the same manufacturing defect, so essentially seeking to to a test of 1000 rolls for 1x dice. (While also doing a brief test to validate my method of roll/read as a means to make up for any general defects)
Basically for the purposes of seed generation, we need a distribution that is reasonably fair, so I opted for something graphical, with simple vocab, that even someone without any background in maths at all can use it and work out if they should need to add extra entropy.
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:02:13
Hey thanks for this, can rely of the folks who take the board games seriously to have put lots of thought into this. :)
I think that for anyone using something more than a bunch of d6 dice (someone suggested a D20 after my last vid) the individual entropy contribution of each dice increases significantly (meaning one dice being unfair does more damage to your overall entropy) and it also becomes harder to properly test them through any method other than a float tests.
Fortunately with the crypto entropy use-case it is actually a bit more forgiving than a board game, even though the stakes are higher, especially if you use a bunch of dice together. Simply put there is less riding on each dice roll in isolation and it's easy to compensate for unfairness, even major unfairness. (eg: you can just assume that you are only getting 2 bits of entropy per role as opposed to ~2.6) 
This is also why I always recommend that people just go for for a 24 word seed over a 12, in that even if entropy generation is really badly flawed (though still not predictable) the extra entropy in 24 words vs 12 provides a massive buffer of additional protection. (Eg: the dice rolls for 24 words would still give you over 128 bits of entropy if a dice roll only gave you 1.3bits of entropy per roll, eg: dice so badly loaded that they mostly behaved like flipping a coin)
