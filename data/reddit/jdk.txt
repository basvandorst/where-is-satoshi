I don't understand. I thought mining is computing the required hash of a nonce/block combo. Since a block contains many transactions, how is mining verifying any of these transactions? And who package these transactions into a block in the first place?

Ah, makes more sense.
@_date: 2011-06-07 10:54:58
My point still stands. In your new example, it depends more on what else I could get for ฿1 in the real world. If I could get a new PC for ฿1, I may not want to fix my PC for the price of ฿1 anymore. To extend this example, if I could exchange that ฿1 for US$3,200 and then use that US$3,200 to buy me a new PC, I may not want to fix my PC for the price of ฿1 anymore. 
This is the reason why merchants and service providers need to peg their BTC prices to the current BTC rate.

If this is true, the outlook for bitcoin is bleak.
@_date: 2011-06-07 09:39:34
Availability of information is the key here. With information, a consumer can compare what they're charged with vs. other known value. If someone wants to charge me 100 BTC to fix a PC and I know that I can buy a new one for 100 BTC, I may not want to fix it anymore. 
Since we are living in the real world, we are tourists in the bitcoin economy. As tourists, we always compare the choices available to consumers in the bitcoin economy to the ones available to us wherever we came from. As long as there are better deals "back home", we're not going to spend our bitcoins in the bitcoin economy. This is the reason why merchants and service providers need to peg their prices to the current BTC rate.
I am not loyal to any currency, I don't have an agenda to change the world by making bitcoin more popular. I spend the currency when doing so gives me a good deal. I suspect most people in any economy are this way.

Exchanges do this all the time. Every now and then a "fat finger mistake" is made and someone makes a call about a window inside which all the trades are reversed. Not sure how Mt.Gox handles it, but in the real world, if you already moved your dollars/shares, now you owe the exchange those dollars/shares.

You addressed the issue of security in terms of "its hard to hack us" (paraphrased), but not the issue of security in terms of "I'm not going to take your coins and run". I say this because it's not that hard to come up with a good looking site, or to create a reddit account to promoted it. You need a way for you to stand out from your competition.
Yes, I read your [About page]( It's better than nothing, but I don't see anything on the page that lends credibility. There is one name listed, but David Sterry is not Bill Gates or Steve Wozniak. There is no inherent trust value that could be derived from the name itself, and the lack of an existing history of the firm doesn't help either. Can you tell us more about yourself? 
EDIT: since the downvoting squad is here, here are some suggestions on reputation, in the order of importance to me:
1. Frequency of auditing of the books (even some mining pools have this)
1. Your reputation on bitcoin-otc
1. Partnering with well trusted individuals
1. Well documented past accomplishments that shows some degree of stability
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:26:12
If Mt.Gox is purely a match maker, and that amount is completely from the 0.65% commissions, that means ฿66,478,442.54510920 have changed hands on Mt.Gox, or US$997,176,638.18 assuming an exchange rate of $15.

Beware, you can only transfer the equivalent of US$1,000 of bitcoins per day. So if you're holding even just a modest amount of 300 coins, it'll take you a month to withdraw it all. You can only hope that nothing happens to Mt Gox in the mean time.

bitcoins takes very little time to transfer, it's the bitcoin app on your computer that needs to download all the blocks. Think of it as received money by wire to your bank account. Your bank account was updated the moment the wiring was made. It's you driving to the bank to find the balance and/or making the withdrawal that is taking the time.

@_date: 2013-04-10 09:15:34
Here is how I've been playing it: I *have* cashed out the value of my original investment (initial amount sent to MtGox, cost of mining equipment, and cost of electricity), plus 100% of that total amount as a reward to myself. The rest was never mine to begin with, and I can afford to lose all of it. I didn't care when it crashed to 0.01 and then bounced back to $12, and I don't care now. I plan on using a coin every now and then if and when I see something I like. That's my plan.
@_date: 2013-03-28 08:50:12

You are saying that a joke is counter productive to something, though I'm not sure what that fragile thing may be. I don't care that Bitcoin goes up or down, at this point I have taken enough cash out of my initial investment in mining equipment and trading that whatever is left in Bitcoin is free money. Lesson number one in investment is never invest in such a scale that  you  can't joke about it when it all goes to hell. In other words, worry more about the return of your money before you worry about the return on your money.

EDIT: 
Dear purists,
Unlike you, not everybody is trying to set an example of how to use/trade/hold Bitcoin for the rest of the world.
Bitcoin does not defy human nature. You yourself may be at one extreme of the spectrum of people who hold bitcoins, but people will do what they want with what they paid for, and in most cases, with less concern for the greater good.  Maybe they'll use it to buy and sell things, maybe they'll treat it like a tradable commodity, or maybe they'll hold and forget about it for years. God forbid, they may even joke about it.  That's just human nature, and you can't coordinate any of this.
