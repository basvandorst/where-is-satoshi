They're painting negative interest rates as a good thing?  Am I not understanding something here?

Oh good point, I'll complain to them too.  Thanks!

Thanks, I'm going to use this to report those Coinabul scammers.

Must be a less profane version of Tourettes than the one I'm familiar with.

Ok thanks will do.  Talking to a law firm in Los Angeles too.  It's not the amount of money (which is relatively trivial), I just hate being scammed.

Yes, I've heard good things about both those companies.  Unfortunately, I picked Coinabul out of a list of those three and obviously made a horrible choice.

Hasn't Mr. Fusion been invented yet?  No, it's not 2015.

We can't deny it because that would be affirming we're in the denial stage.  Damn you're clever.

I think they may have built a dyson sphere and used it to crack the password.

Did you get your coin in the end?  It's been around 4 months for me now, and yes they're refusing to refund.
I'll get them eventually, I'll never give up until I either get my coin, refund, or Jay Shore is in jail.  They chose the wrong person to scam unfortunately.

Well now that those hand dryers are everywhere I'm sure it won't be long till Dyson starts manufacturing spheres too.

Only 1,000 years though.  After that no more atomic energy.  I weep for our great^30 -grandchildren

If you don't mind a short boat commute, I'd recommend starting your business in Sealand.
