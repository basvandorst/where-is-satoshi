right, so does 2 of 3 mean bitgo and bitfinex had 1 each and 1 was offline? So effectively the hacker was able to control Bitfinex's and the offline key which would bypass bitgo? Is that possible or does everything have to involve bitgo.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:26:51
with the recent problems they had, going offline at least twice since moving data center, i wouldn't be surprised if the data center is the problem here. I don't know about multi sig but maybe someone got access to the servers by simply having control from within the center.

Does 63% haircut mean people who lost coins have to accept a loss of 63% and they will get 37% refunded over time? If so, why can't they just keep refunding indefinitely until 100% is paid back, even if it's 2-5 years?

Bitfinex also allows you to lock withdrawls to a certain address, I really like that, if you disable it to change it you have to wait something like 3 or 5 days.

welcome, I had the same issues when trying to import my blockchain key into the Bitcoin Cash wallet, a different address kept showing up until I learnt about compressed/uncompressed and used the bitaddress github thing to get the correct key. It's a good thing to know for the future if it happens again.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:41:46
basically you're dealing with compressed and uncompressed issues here, so don't panic. One private key can = 2 different addresses.
basically, download bitaddress.org from the github and use it offline to import your blockchain key, that will show you both addresses with private keys for both and you can pick the right one.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:09:04
the hardware part is almost irrelevant, it can be replaced any time. The most important part is the 24 word seed you get when you create your wallet, you can have all the things you list above happen and not care, as long as you have your seed stored somewhere safely elsewhere, like split it in half and have 12 words each engraved in metal and stored in two different locations. Those seed words will let you recover your wallet in many different wallet sites/hardware wallets.
In terms of the stolen part, the trezor can have a pin number, up to 10 digits, and every time someone enters it wrong the time to wait for the next try doubles, you can also have hidden wallets so even if you gave access to one account with dust in it they wouldn't know about your hidden address with your money in.

"If drivechains are deployed in 2018, the first iteration of such a sidechain could well be “Bitcoin Extended:” essentially a “big block" version of Bitcoin to allow for more transaction throughput."
“Miners could activate drivechains tomorrow"
I'm amazed this hasn't been talked about more, we're talking about bigger blocks done through a soft fork. I don't understand why this isn't a great thing. Isn't this a fantastic and much needed solution? Jihan should be all over this.
Schnorr Signatures: "historical transactions suggest it would save an average of 25 percent per transaction, which would increase Bitcoin’s maximum transaction capacity by about 33 percent."
sounds amazing.
Looks like Bitcoin is about to take a good dose of steroids and morph into something incredible. By the time we halve in 2 1/2 years Bitcoin will look like a beast compared to now.

the biggest factor is the size and quality of the development team. Virtually every altcoin is all hope and promises without anything of substance. Also, 99% of altcoins have never had to deal with scaling, Bitcoin is pretty much the only coin that is actually having to deal with real world issues for real world use, if you looked at all coins in terms of actual development then Bitcoin would be miles ahead of anything else and that wont stop because Bitcoin has a larger pool of developers and of better quality.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:01:47
you can disable withdrawals for any currency they list ie: every currency is disabled except bitcoin which is locked to one address. Any change results in a few days block before you can do anything.

 it's amazing that you can have children who already have some kind of security in life and can focus on what they really want to do, not have to worry they'll struggle to get a footing in life and maybe lose sight of their passions just to stay above water financially. $50k at 15 is so fantastic, my honest advice though, if only you have the private key, don't give her all the money in one go at 18. I was in a similar situation, when you're 25-30yo that money will be so much better used, like to buy a house with, at 18 it wont be so wisely spent, I would tell her it's her "buying a house" fund, or she can have the 0.45btc at 18 and the rest is to buy a house with/when she hits 30 etc.

"seized the $91,800 in cash, as it was hidden in a speaker cabinet "

I still think a sweeper block is a good idea, once a day the mempool gets swept empty, no block reward. What happens to the fees would need to be agreed upon but in general I don't see why we couldnt sweep the excess transactions of the day once every day. People who are happy to wait for their confirmations can send low/zero fee knowing they wait until the end of the day whilst urgent transactions continue as normal.

it is isn't it, their only claim is that they can process a transaction in 10 minutes. Users will have the choice of instant lightning or 10 min Bcash and because Bcash is so committed to doing everything on chain they've made it impossible to do anything quicker than 10 minutes on average, not to mention the fact they have a joke of a development team.

the funny thing with the private blockchain nonsense is that you have to have blind faith that their nodes are legit and honest. There could easily be no way to verify what they are doing at all, just the companies saying "trust us", now where have i heard that before? It's just another centralised thing that controls everything and they want us to believe them when there would be no proof at all that their ledger is legit and  true.

the more coins you have and the longer you leave them in one place the more your "days" builds up, so when you eventually move them you are "destroying" that build up of days and you effectively reset to 0. So, if you moved 1000btc for the first time in a year you would be destroying a hell of a lot of days, i think it would simply be 365x1000= # of days destroyed.

they wouldnt have lost anything because the private keys wouldn't have been stored by target. People would have just sent bitcoins to buy things, they wouldn't be providing private keys to target to buy something. The company itself wouldn't have had to pay out over $100m because they wouldn't have had anything to compromise.
so you have one case with $0 loss to customers (as you claim) and $100m loss to the company and the bitcoin case where 0 would have been lost by either side.

@_date: 2017-02-07 17:07:11
my advice would be to setup a full Core node, a crazy Chinese dictator can have as much hash power as he likes  but it's the nodes that decide if blocks get accepted or not. All Core and SegWit supporters should be looking to run a full node to help protect the network and guard against a hostile attack from JihanWuDictatorCoin.  If he tried a full on attack we could simply reject BU blocks and suddenly his business becomes worthless, all that hashpower and nowhere to use it. Mining and having blocks accepted on the Bitcoin network is a privilege not a right, Jihan Wu would be wise to think about that.

mixture of both, some banking systems around the world are struggling, if a really tiny % of that money goes into Bitcoin it would still impact the price a lot. 
The ETF for sure is part of it too, people will see the chance to make massive gains at the risk of maybe 10-20% loss, it's a pretty good bet if you think there's chances of doubling or tripling your money within a few months.

there does appear to be a whale on Bitstamp, the order book became inflated, few minutes later it dropped by 1.5k on the sell side and 4k on the buy side, few minutes later the sell side was back to 2.5k and the buy side had 2k back on, sitting at 3.5k. Someone market bought 500btc then had a 1500 wall at $1k prior to that, very unusual for Stamp
EDIT - the order book is back to 1.2k sell side 1.6k buy side (bitcoinwisdom view), it was 2.7k sell side 5.6k buy side earlier so 1.5k + 4k difference. Someone with a lot of $$$ is lurking there.

If you used localbitcoins  the coins are safe and locked in the site, he cannot do anything with them, you need to contact the support and explain, if you show them proof you sent the money they'll release the coins to you. They will help you, if you can prove you sent the money do not worry, he must have the Bitcoins on the site to be able to advertise them and when you buy they are locked in the system.

Core nodes should reject any unlimited blocks and ban them from the network, there's a huge difference between allowing a legitimate alternate software a chance to grow and what Jihan Wu is doing with BU. They are literally attacking Bitcoin and trying a hostile takeover, it's time to do away with what is "fair" and do what is needed and right. When you do what they're doing you lose the right to be treated fairly, they need dealt with, reject their blocks.

SW is on the table, ready to go.
SW is the most popular choice of the miners (BU 18.6% v SW 23.3%)
Core has 85% of the node network v  BU 9.5%
One Chinese dictator Jihan Wu, a BU supporter, is blocking the network from upgrading.
BU is causing the delays, their fans say we should change to BU because of the delays that they're causing.  
It's time the Core team and the nodes rejected BU blocks and banned their nodes and got the system upgraded. BU have proved they're not interested in fairness, they've proved they're aggressive and hostile and want to take over the Bitcoin network by any means necessary, it's time for Core to defend the network from attack. If Jihan Wu wants to threaten Bitcoin let's see how much he talks when his mining operation is null and void.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:01:09
overtaken in what? you wont overtake the node count and your JihanWuDictator coin wont take over Bitcoin, having one person deploy hash power to overtake cores hashpower means nothing in terms of real support. If you think the bitcoin community and economy will dump Bitcoin in favor of a hostile dictator coin then you're a fool.

It's absolutely time to accept the fact that BU is not as it portrays itself and we have every right to defend ourselves from a hostile attack. There's a huge difference between allowing a genuine dev team to roll out their own software and an evil group of people trying to attack and destroy Bitcoin. Core should take steps to remove BU hashpower and nodes from the network so we can get on with scaling and upgrading Bitcoin. They have no desire to see Bitcoin succeed or to help it scale, they want to damage it as much as possible. It's time Core fought back. Let BU make their own altcoin, see how well that does.

The spam attack has been detected and exposed and plainly obvious to anyone that looks at it, only delusional idiots like you who have one agenda in mind deny it.

None of it wins them any support and they're getting more and more desperate to try and lure people into their lies. They know no one is supporting them and no one is buying their lies but they have no other way to attack so they rinse and repeat.

r/btc continue to expose themselves as the virus they are. They're just liars and manipulators, but hopefully their own actions are exactly what helps people to decide to ignore their hostile attack on Bitcoin and that's why it'll never gain any real support.
Roger Ver is a real dirty scumbag and he proves it time and time again, he literally wants to control whatever he wants and if he doesn't get his way then he'll set out to destroy it. If these people actually think a community of Bitcoiners will let them take control of Bitcoin, they're insane

I mentioned that in the other new thread higher up, wasn't sure if that section was new or not, I'm guessing it is, it is interesting, because the question is how far would the SEC let things go before before rejecting it? If they're against it they should've just done it before, I'm still thinking it wont get approved but how far do you let a company go in preparation, time, money spent, structure etc of the ETF before rejecting them? I'll keep telling myself it will get rejected so I don't get my hopes up but what a nice surprise it would be.

for best value i would probably setup a bank account with Fidor and send funds to Bitstamp or Kraken. Fidor are bitcoin friendly so shouldn't be a problem and you get best value for your money. Kraken is smaller but it is partnered with Fidor so might be the easiest method. Most hassle free way is to just do what you're doing, buy off local bitcoins and pay yourself back.

Im convinced that ETH and Ver hired the same people to pump ETH like maniacs whilst hating on Bitcoin in the same manner. I always thought the ETH fans sounded exactly like the BTC haters.
I'm also convinced Ver has almost no BTC left and he's all in on altcoins. I also think Jihan Wu is just a complete idiot who's been conned by Ver giving him the "Core are evil, they want to take away your fees and income, don't let them" and he fell for it. Wu is just a dumb fool who's destroying his own business because he can't admit and see who Ver is.
This entire situation is nothing more than Ver+ETH running a gigantic pump and dump on altcoins and trying to disrupt BTC any way they can.
The sad part is they're succeeding so far.

you clearly don't know what you're talking about, "hostile takeover" is a perfect way to describe what Ver and Wu are trying to do, they're trying to seize control of Bitcoin and make themselves extremely powerful within a new setup. They are spending huge amounts of money and waging a non stop FUD, propaganda and lying  campaign. They want to get control of Bitcoin at whatever cost, hostile takeover is exactly what it is.

for them to just suspend BTC withdrawls without warning is disturbing, but as I understood it they were still allowed to withdraw fiat. If those withdrawls are working then there's no gox but it'd be interesting to know if the fiat withdrawls have been going through as they should or if there's "unexpected delays".
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:15:48
yes it's probably not the best way to word it, that mining pool could have hundreds of different users but the pool itself only makes one type of block, so if some users don't upgrade the pool software they would be using hashpower to create blocks that aren't valid within the pool, that's what they mean by "hardfork". In order to keep everyone mining the same way within their pool they give notices like that for people to upgrade. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:11:52

It's better to have one person control everyone right? like Jihan Wu with all the BU people. The total fail of BU supporters is that they cry about Core but want to have one crazy chinese dictator control Bitcoin. Also, saying you want  a useless, amateur and downright dangerous dev team take over is ridiculous beyond belief. If you can't see the stupidity in that then there's no help for you.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:39:43
funny how you BU people do nothing but try to deflect away from the truth. BU didn't find the bug themselves, they lied, it's totally irrelevant who Gardner is, the fact is BU lied, but please dont let that stop you from pointlessly trying to deflect away from the truth.  It's funny because you say "it could be Todd himself" but that itself would also prove the point that BU didn't discover the bug.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:50:20
but like i already stated a single invalid block would do nothing , just like the single invalid BU block a few weeks back did nothing. 
The only way to create mayhem is if the miners deliberately attacked the network.
"All that has to happen is a SINGLE miner mines a SINGLE malicious." - that's true now as well, miners can mine malicious blocks anytime they want, BU could mine one today if they wanted to, that threat has always been in the system and is nothing to do with a UASF.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:39:36
no actually it's the truth, they're crying about transaction backlogs, they blame Core for it yet they mine empty and part filled blocks, which makes the problem worse. They're deliberately doing it to push their own agenda.
the truth isn't FUD.

Notice a master liar at work.
Notice the difference between his first lie of "BU devs found the bug"
Now notice his narrative "BU devs found out about the bug before Todd exposed to the public"
His latest manipulation is actually true, they were told about the bug before it was exposed by Todd but his original lie was simply "BU devs found a bug". They didn't, he lied and now he's making comments that he can justify in his own mind.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:02:51
they've been hating on Bitcoin ever since it was worth almost nothing, it's one reason why no one will ever take them seriously or spend any time there, it's basically like:
"Bitcoin is $1, it sucks it'll never work"
"Bitcoin is $100, it sucks it'll never work"
"Bitcoin is $1000, it sucks it'll never work"
whilst everyone else is getting rich and loving it, all they have is their sub reddit to circle jerk in.

1) for an entity to take control of something doesn't mean that something had control previously.
2) BU doesn't just put out software, they want to fork the network and then attack the other chain to death, forcing everyone onto their chain.
3) post core wouldn't have more decentralized development because Jihan Wu would be running his dictatorship, deciding by himself which updates get accepted on the network because he would be the one sole person controlling the mining network.
4) you say trusting Core is unhealthy but you're saying it's ok to switch to trusting the entire industry to BU which is handing control to Jihan Wu, Roger Ver and a totally amateur and dangerusly poor development team, that's just downright reckless.

Core isn't private, anyone can join, BU would be a closed government where you have to be voted in to be allowed to sit at Roger and Jihans table. That's nothing like Core, any developers can join the coding team. I doubt we would see 100+ people contribute to Vers government.

the title of the topic is discussing one of the ways BU attack the chain to try and force people onto BUcoin.
the title of the topic is not "here's is a technical step by step guide as to how BU can destroy a chain"
there are huge differences between showing tactics that people use to try and achieve an aim and step by step technical explanations as to how to actually achieve something.
If you want someone to write you a step by step on how to actually destroy a chain perhaps you should create your own topic asking for such a thing, this topic is about discussing one of the ways BU attack the chain. there is a big difference

Needlessly shuffling coins around to deliberately cause problems for everyone.
They think that Bitcoin companies and users will run to, join and support the very people who are currently attacking us and the ones who have already admitted that they would attack any chain they split from. 
It's time this stopped, it's time Core took action to get rid of this Vermin who openly admit what they are doing and will do. They genuinely think that we will run to the very people who are attacking us, that's how delusional they are.

why drag it out, so stupid waiting until very last minute then saying oh you dont have agreements in place sorry.

they mine empty blocks, ie instead of including 2,000 - 4,000 transactions they include none. This clearly doesn't help the transaction backlog and only makes it worse. Then they blame the developers for the backlog whilst trying to get people to support their  side of the debate.

go and ask the BU people that are blocking Bitcoin from upgrading, they're the ones you should vent your never ending anger at. Nodes,miners and the community all support SW over BU and SW is ready to go, so if the problems you stated are such a big issue then you should go and vent at the people who are causing the problem and that would be Jihan Wu, Roger Vermin and the rest of BU. they are the ones blocking Bitcoin from upgrading to the solution that is supported more than any other option on the table.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:24:12
buying and selling on localbitcoins is your best bet, then it's just normal people sending back and forth and for the amounts you're talking about you wont have a problem.
One advice I would give is make the effort to setup numerous accounts now, in case any of your accounts do get checked, also I would keep your main daily account that has direct debits etc separate from your account buying and selling Bitcoins.
If you dont have good credit to open up lots of bank accounts you can still ask them for a cashcard account, that'll just give you an atm card but it's a proper account with online banking etc, so there's no reason why you can't open lots of accounts.
Just be smart about it, dont use an account that has lots of money sitting in it in case they take it and keep it away from your normal daily affairs.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:45:10
It's like something out of a parallel universe, "President of the Confederation" seriously WTF, I take it that's the title that Ver decided for himself.
So BU seem to think that the original Satoshi design was for Bitcoin to be a controlled, centralised dictatorship privately run by a tiny group of people who shower themselves with grand titles to fit their egos.
How any BU fan can seriously claim they'll be carrying on the original design is beyond me, it's literally surreal.

you'll see that every time they upgraded they gave a "hardfork" notice, i think hardfork is more to do with their pool software than with the main Bitcoin chain.

Thankfully we have people like Samson Mow or we'd be handing control of Bitcoin over to a bunch of amateurs and part timers. Classic has 5 developers, Core's last release credited 84 developers. Classic basically = wait for Core to release an update, put a Classic sticker on it and voila! you have Classics's new release. They don't offer anything of any substance to the community, they have nothing else to do but troll Reddit and Twitter all day, every day, if they actually bothered to do some work coding and developing it might help. After 7 years of Bitcoin, Classic's contribution is zero.

@_date: 2017-03-05 09:56:28
you dont even reply to the facts do you? the problems you portray would only happen if the miners deliberately attacked the network, which is something they could do today if they wanted to. Then you have the choice, just like you would today, follow the main chain or follow the forked BUminerattack coin. It's no different to creating an altcoin based off Bitcoin, you could add it if you wish to your site, just like you can add any of the altcoins.
Your whole "report" doesn't hold much water because it's all things that can happen right now, it has nothing to do with a UASF. Anyone can create a chain split any time they like.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:28:31
the chain would only split if the miners deliberately attack the network, then it would be  "Bitcoin" vs "BUminerattackcoin". BU can split the chain right now if they want. The UASF wouldn't change anything, there's nothing stopping BU splitting right now, anyone can create an altcoin if they so wish.

your reply is exactly what's wrong with the situation, acting like miners are the rulers of Bitcoin when it's just pure delusion. As Dooglus has stated, the FACTS are that miners process transactions, for doing that they get paid with Bitcoins, if they mine invalid blocks they don't get paid, if they make their own rules and go off running new softare then they can have their alt coin, Bitcoin will carry on regardless. But one thing is for sure, Miners do not rule Bitcoin, they process transactions, that's it, they get paid for their work and that's it.

And all you're literally saying is "attacking the other chain is a good idea" That's not exactly proving your point is it? all you're saying is "BU supporter Gavin agrees that BU hostile attacking your chain is a good idea". 
"we attack and destroy you for your own security" that should be the BU logo.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:29:36
One problem is i don't think BU really care about that. 
They look at the ETH setup and the pump that's happened there, $1 to $45 and governed by Vitalik.
 BU just wants to be setup like ETH so they can pump their millions, they'd have a governing body making decisions to avoid drawn out debates and you'd see the anti core shills suddenly become crazed Bitcoin pumpers.
The sad part is, if BU got control you can see the whole crypto scene literally becoming the new age pump and dump of epic proportions, where each coins governing body spends fortunes on social media spin to pump their own coin and interests.
On the Core side you have people wanting to create something technically incredible and ground breaking and on the BU side you have people wanting to turn their millions into Billions by pouring money into pump and dump.

but..but..but  according to BU people it's totally ok to fix problems after they happen, there's nothing to see here, it'd be perfectly acceptable to run the network on software that forked when updated or nodes with critical bugs causing potentially millions in damage. 
According to them it's perfectly ok to have a $20B industry based on a "let's wait until it's broken then fix it after" 
absolute joke, not one sane person could ever say Bitcoin would be better off with amateur devs who have no idea how to code Bitcoin.

a UASF doesn't break consensus, miners can carry on mining on the software they are already on, they don't have to change anything, it is backwards compatable. All it means is that people who want to mine using SW can, people that don't want to don't have to. a UASF doesn't force anyone to do anything, it simply allows more options for people to use.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:34:47
the banks have said that they're going to make their own private ETH blockchains that you need permission to use and they have no need for the currency at all. So you're looking at multiple private ETH blockchains that you need the banks permission to use and they control, no need for the current ETH chain or the ETH currency.
Sounds amazing right?

try reading the thread , why do people have to spell things out step by step for you when it's already been posted and shown in the actual thread, why don't you try actually reading the thing rather than expect people to repeat themselves simply because you're lazy?
seeing as you're too lazy, one of the main tactics admitted earlier is one of the things going on right now with the mempool bloat, that is already causing problems
"I, and most others, will be actively shuffling our corecoins back and forth between our addresses to overload the minority chain and eliminate its utility. "
not to mention the $100m pledged to attack and destroy the other chain by the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:40:42
they also mine part filled blocks, 300k, 800k etc and they also say that they'll mine empty blocks any time they like because they can. It's nothing to do with speed of blocks im afraid and it's all about pushing their agenda.

One interesting fact is that miners are running Core software but signalling for BU.
What if the way miners signalled was changed to something very simple like voting was based upon which software they ran?
If they supported and wanted to signal BU they'd have to run their software to vote for it.
It seems ridiculous to me that they can use Core software, knowing it's far superior to BU, but still be allowed to signal for BU when their software is available to use. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:01:34

When the SW ACK thread was posted on Reddit the Classic brigade realised that SW is so close to finshing they all came running out the woodwork and then a day later we get this nonsense.

but old blocks would still be valid after the soft fork, miners who don't want to upgrade would still be able to mine exactly as they currently do. In order to split the chain the miners would have to deliberately create invalid blocks and fork the chain on purpose, that's something they can do right now if they so wish.
Miners would have 3 choices:
1) upgrade and use SW
2) stay exactly as they are now 
3) create an invalid block on purpose and fork the chain.
So, the miners could very easily carry on mining exactly as they are now, no one is forcing them to use SW, or they could use SW, it would be their free choice. 
As it has been stated, the SF is backwards compatible. An invalid block should have no greater effect than the recent one mined by BU, it was totally irrelevant and did nothing to the network.
The only way a  fork would turn bad is if it was a deliberate attack by the miners.

On the other hand I find it surprising that GBTC applied to have their ETF listed after the "less than 25% chance" reports came out, so are they more confident it'll get approved or do they know something we dont?

If people want to scoff or mock Bitcoin then I'm happy to let them, it's like doing it to the internet in the 90's. There may be nothing like this for decades and the people who can't recognize it for what it is deserve to miss out. It's separating the wheat from the chaff.

yes, spot on. The only tricky part of the entire situation you have now is converting the 12 word seed correctly to access your BCH but it's not difficult, it's just that a priv key can be compressed or decompressed so actually one priv key can result in 2 dif addresses. When i converted my 12 word seed i ended up with the wrong address, but i knew it meant that it was just one of two addresses not that something had gone horribly wrong and the key was bugged or corrupted or something, i just needed to convert the key slightly differently. You should bookmark this page which explains how to use the bitaddress.org tool, when entering your priv key (obtained from the bip 39 converter) it shows you both the compressed and decompressed keys.

If someone gave me an ultimatum like that, when i knew full well they had no real knowledge of the side they are against, I would kick them out the door and not regret it for one second. It's nothing to do with Bitcoin, it's about someone being so selfish they couldn't care less about your feelings and she has zero interest in learning and understanding about the other side, she simply demands you give it up and do what she says. 
Someone who reacts like that is not someone you want to live with for the rest of your life, over reacting, making ridiculous over the top demands like that, no thank you, I'd rather be single, there are loads of good women out there who wouldn't blackmail you like that.

the key point really is to buy from somewhere reputable and transfer the coins into cold storage as soon as you can. as long as coins are on an exchange you can't really consider them as belonging to you, it's only when you get them transferred out and into offline cold storage that you have complete control over the coins and your private keys.

the BCH are effectively just sitting in the address they were in when the fork happened, so you can access them anytime you like, you don't need to claim them or anything, they already exist so as long as you have the private key for that address you're fine. It was still worth moving your Bitcoins, i think it's good to have your Bitcoins in one wallet and your BCH in another wallet, so you can happily leave the BCH as they are and just look after two private keys now instead of one.

did you move your coins to a new electrum wallet with a new seed or just to a new address within electrum? If you moved your coins to a new address but you didn't create a new seed then all you did was move the coins to a new address within the same seed and when you import your seed to electron cash you expose not just one address but every address associated with that seed.

bcc is really a different coin (bitcoin connect), bch thought they could just take another coins abbreviation. Bitfinex also had another futures item trading as bcc so they called Bitcoin Cash BCH, which is much more sensible. Some people still call BCH BCC but really that's how confusion results.

yes, you can thank the people on that list for these problems. They are the ones who were crying for a scaling solution like it was an emergency, but when the community decided that SW was the preferred solution they suddenly turned 180 and became determined to block a solution, it just shows what their true intentions are.
Roger Vermin and the miners are the ones who you should vent any anger and frustration at, especially Vermin.
SW is the most popular choice but the miners seem to not care about democracy or fairness, they want to dictate how Bitcoin is run when their job is just to mine blocks. That's the biggest problem with Bitcoin, miners were never meant to be the "rulers of Bitcoin" it doesn't make sense that the developers can work so hard for months and years but then they have to get the approval of miners to have anything implemented, that isn't right.

based on not having done anything at all with your btc.
move your bitcoins to a new wallet (if within electrum i mean with a new seed NOT to another address within the same seed)
take your old (now empty) private key and load it into electron cash
now you'll have your bitcoins safe in a clean address with a new seed and your BCH loaded into electroncash ready to send.

it has been around since the split and there havent been any reported problems. My advice is to setup your exchange account and that means you can import your priv key and immediately transfer your coins to the exchange. Then, if you wish, you can delete electron cash, you only need to use it for a few minutes. If you're happy to hold your BCHcoins then you dont need to import your key in the first place so really you only need the BCH wallet software for a very short time.

yeah sure no problem, I'm going to walk my dogs now but i'll set it up as painless as possible for you. I was the exact same as you and blockchain is a little tricky but I took my time and once i understood it's quite easy, but it is also easy to get stuck and not know what to do.
I'll be back about 2hrs from now and then i'll type it up for you so you'll get it within 2hrs after that. You can add me on facebook if you want to ask questions during the process.
In the meantime the first thing you want to do regardless of anything is setup a new bitcoin wallet and transfer the coins out of the address that they were in when the hard fork happened. So, if you're happy with blockchain.info setup a new wallet, double/triple check all details, log into it a few times, make sure all details are correct and backed up then trasnfer your coins to your new wallet. We need to use your old (now empty) wallet to claim your BCh so the  priorty right now is to move your bitcoins to a safe new address separate from the old wallet.

Ver is a very sick man, he acts like he's clean as a whistle, a very pure and innocent man, there must be a word for someone that's so delusional who carries out a whole host of tactics then acts like he's never done a single one of them and at the same time makes it his lifes work to accuse other people of doing exactly what he does.

getting everything setup is the next stage. Choose which exchange you want to use to cashout your bch, I used Viabtc, so i setup my account, made it secure with 2fa etc and did their basic verification (just passport number and name no photo id uploads) and it was intsant, that gave me 100btc a day withdrawal.
After that's done you want to download electron cash from their official site
You then need to take your private key from your now empty blockchain wallet and convert the key/12 word seed so it can be imported to electron cash.  I used the website converter 
but you can also download it from the github if you prefer
either is fine but with both cases you want to disconnect from the internet just for safety before you use them. The info below is pasted from the guide i used:
Enter your Blockchain.info recovery phrase/seed in the webpage next to 'BIP39 Mnemonic'
Leave all the rest of the entries set to their default
Scroll down to the 'Derived Addresses' section and you should now see a list of addresses that will match the list of addresses in blockchain.info for your wallet. 
Find the address you used and copy its private key.
you can then import that private key into electron cash, if the address that shows up in electron cash does not match your old blockchain.info then message me again and ill tell you the extra step to get the correct key, as long as the address was correct on the bip39 converter but incorrect in electron cash then it's just a simple fix by decompressing the key before importing to electron cash but hopefully it should work.
any problems or questions let me know, if the importing goes fine you will now have a balance in electron cash and you can transfer to an exchange, so by having the exchange already setup it minimises the time the coins spend in electron cash.

It's ironic to think that the ones who have been screaming for scaling the loudest and longest are now the ones trying to block Bitcoin scaling.

It's blindingly obvious that Ver has no support, 99% of the noise that surrounds him comes from sock puppets with names regularly disappearing only for brand new names to pop up and immediately become the most vocal of the group. 
His entire operation stinks of a very small amount of people creating endless fake spam in a desperate attempt to seem like they have support.
I truly would love to know how many real people actually support him and post on r/btc because i wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be less than 10, and maybe even just 2 or 3 people posting from multiple fake accounts.
For some reason Ver thinks that the entire bitcoin community is stupid and that all he has to do is lie and produce endless mountains of propaganda and spam and everyone will just dump core and follow him.
The guy is getting more desperate by the day.

Ver seems to think that making the entire Bitcoin community hate him will somehow magically turn everyone against Core and make them support him instead. I find it  bizarre behaviour.

everything works smoothly, it really depends when you want to sell, if you're happy to wait there's no rush, if you think it'll fall i'd go for it now.
If you know which exchange you want to sell on I'd say get fully sorted on that so it's all ready to go, then you can import your private key to electron cash and transfer it out to the exchange straight after.

so the next attack wave begins. Countdown until the flood of propaganda from the other sub,according to them this is what natural growth looks like:
They also claimed it had to do with fewer blocks being mined but there's been 148 in the last 24hrs, so more than expected. It seems this attack is more blatant and they aren't even bothered about hiding it.
Also, the 3 major spam attacks we've seen recently have all started around the same time of day, which doesn't surprise me at all, but of course it's all natural right?

every one of those people would be insanely rich by now if they'd not been complete assholes and bought even just a couple of $k worth, but I guess that's what you get if you're an asshole.
15th Sept 2011 , price of Bitcoin = $4.70
21st Dec   2016 ,  price of Bitcoin = $815
=  173.4x your money
sums up a buttcoiner for me, making fun of it when it's $4 and still doing same old thing even after the price has risen 175x in value in 5 years.

localbitcoins can be easier but the problems you face are thanks to the laws in your country and not to do with crypto itself. If a seller wants to run a business being a Bitcoin broker and be 100% legit they have to follow the same regulations and kyc laws as other money transmitters, it's the old system not the new unfortunately.

they're creating(solving) blocks, not transactions, the transactions are just things you fill the blocks with.
1) the miners get rewarded for finding the block, it doesn't matter how many transactions are in it. They can publish a block with 0 transactions in it and still get the reward, currently 12.5btc. So, in the very beginning you just mined a few empty blocks, each block gave 50btc reward and so the currency gradually came into circulation, you didn't need any transactions, just some computing power to start producing blocks to claim the 50btc reward.
2) When currency is all issued miners will rely on transaction fees that are attached to transactions, people who send Bitcoin can add whatever fee they like. Right now publishing a block gets you the mining reward + the transaction fees for all the transactions you fill the block with.

yeah I know, that's wy it was so bizarre when a few months later they said Circle was the 2nd biggest crypto trader in the world.

“We don’t enable direct consumer trading, we market make on all major exchanges, and provide OTC liquidity services to institutions,” explains the Circle founder.
So like i said, it actually all makes sense to me now, they dropped the whole customer service side to just trade, it's so much simpler if you think about it, not having to deal with millions of people ,AML/KYC regulations etc etc, just trade and market make and be liquidity providers, cut out all the hassle.

We really have to wait for the fork to unfold but in the case of the  BitcoinCash fork it worked along the lines of: after the fork transfer your Bitcoins to a new address, then you can take the private keys of the now empty address and load them into software for the forked coin. this would keep your Bitcoins safe and allow you to now access forked coins from your old address. The upcoming fork may be slightly different so I'm going to wait and see how it unfolds but the developers of Trezor are amazing and if they can sort it out for their customers they will and you'll be able to do it all within your Trezor. A lot of it comes down to each individual wallet provider how they handle it for their customers.
If you wish to use bitcoin then I would say yes put your main investment in safe cold storage and just use a trusted commercial app wallet on your phone to mess around with, knowing that you could handle it if the coins in that wallet were lost/hacked/etc.

I would use localbitcoins, u can start a trade, pay with fast payments and have your coins released all in just a few minutes, compared to having to verify with exchanges and waiting for bank trasnfers to be deposited.
opeing an account there gives you a wallet to use. You should transfer the coins off the site to your own private wallet where you have control of the private keys.
When the fork happens you dont need to have coins on an exchange as the new fork basically creates an exact copy so everyone gets duplicate coins no matter where they're stored. I'm leaving my coins in my Trezor.
If you're serious about Bitcoin and will stick around I would get a trezor (or a ledger wallet if you prefer) to keep your funds safe. Like you say, you can have a wallet on your phone if you want with a small amount in, but for serious money and long term holding get a hardware wallet for cold storage.

@_date: 2017-11-16 12:31:03
yes everything you wrote above is correct. Some people might worry/think that every bitcoin CB held at the time of the fork is now frozen and cannot be used until people receive their Bcash and that CB can only operate using new deposits and coins that have been moved around after the fork. This isn't the case, CB can use any Bitcoin they like as the balances of the forked coins still exist happily on a separate ledger and aren't effected by origianal chain moves.

very similar story to a lot of people i think, you just get to the point where you give up trying to get people to understand the fundementals and potential of Bitcoin so that price doesn't matter. I held through the 3 year bear market because I still thought it had once in a lifetime global potential to disrupt multiple billion/trillion $ markets. 
I tried to convince some friends but gave up because either they get it or they don't and they didn't, sucks to be them.

the disappointing thing for me is there doesn't seem to be any proposal to change the Bitcoin difficulty more regularly, every 2-3 weeks is proving to be dangerous when faced with miners who are out to intentionally attack Bitcoin. I don't see any reason why we couldn't change it every day or 100 blocks or so.
Or couldn't they introduce a new concept like a sweeper block, so if mempool became 50k transactios+ a sweeper block would  sweep the mempool empty without block reward but the fees could go towards Bitcoin development. I really like the idea of sweeper blocks to empty the mempool any time it gets to a certain level.

Core really needs to change the difficulty adjustment period, it's obvious that it's far too long right now because miners have shown they're happy to destroy something in the name of profit, we need to protect them from their own stupidity. There's no reason why we couldn't adjust difficulty every 100 blocks or 24h, something like that rather than every 2016 blocks.

no user asked for Jihan Wu to install a chinese governing body onto them.
Litecoin was going to activate SW, it was at 80%, then Jihan steps in and blocks it from activating by deploying a large amount of new hashrate.
SW was going to activate without any need for a "roundtable" or any kind of voting body.
Now they want you to proclaim that consensus has been reached thanks to this new roundtable, when we didn't even need it in the first place.
Decentralisation goes out the window, hello centralised Chinese governing body.

You have to think of Core as being the dominant one and Blockstream being the follower. Core make the decisions as to the path they want to go down to help Bitcoin improve. Blockstream can then decide how to develop products and services that would help that path flourish.
I want to give you this analogy, imagine you're sitting on a Council and you all meet and decide which path and development route to take to make your city the best it can be. Would you then go out and create a company and take it down a totally different path on your own and then sort of fight the council and try to force it down a different route? No, because you were there in the meetings and discussions and agreed the path forward, you know the direction things are going in so why would you then go out and make a company to go in a totally different direction? It's like fighting against yourself, which would be totally bizarre.

If you understand the fact that some core developers created the company Blockstream then you'll understand the FUD from the other side more clearly. They make out it's some evil company trying to control Bitcoin and it's developers. The reality is some of the Core developers created the company and it's more a case of blockstream being owned and run by Core developers rather than the other way around. If you started a company would people say " Ooooooo that bad company, it's controlling you and making you do things" ? 
So, your question doesn't really make sense because you're asking "give me an explanation of the influence some Core developers have in the direction and development of Bitcoin Core"

you hear that everyone, we the users have no right to an opinion or to have any influence whatever. HOW DARE WE assume that a decentralised democratic process would listen to us or ask our opinion.

"there are ways to earn influence..." such facepalm, why don't you go work for a bank lol

satoshidice was such a weird one, did someone really buy the site for 120k+ bitcoins? it seemed like there was always a cloud of uncertainty hanging over how legit the purchase was. After it was sold, it had low traffic because of off chain gambling like primedice and just-dice, yet we've never heard a thing from the entity that bought it, I can't see any possible way that they made a return on their investment. They've never once talked to the community or shown any real presence, so who owned it, who ran it, for being the biggest purchase ever for Bitcoins it's all very mysterious.

It basically states that Chinese dictators have created their own "roundtable" (government) and in order for anyone to get something implemented you must go to China and meet with the "roundtable" and they will decide if your idea will be approved.
It's astounding, China thinks they can just seize 100% control of both Bitcoin and Litecoin, install their own governing body and then dictate to developers that they must travel to China to seek approval from the "roundtable".
How about the miners come West and beg the developers not to write them out of crypto.
This whole thing has become East v West and the Chinese dictators think they can seize control. It's becoming clear that Ver is nothing more than an opportunist who's willing to bend over for Jihan in the hope that he makes a lot of money from it, he's happily sold himself to Jihan and become his propaganda pusher.
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:27:05
usefu idiots I think, otherwise jihan wouldn't have turned to others to come up with extension blocks, he couldve just said to BU devs to make something like segwit but that allows Asicboost.
He knew they were as incompetent as we all know so he turned to Poon instead.

they're not really ignorable if they're mostly made up of miners and the miners then act on the decided outcome. The problem indeed is miner centralisation, litecoin users now need to act to remove the new cartel from the decision making process. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:24:43
but it took them 1 day to code it, that means it's amazing right? It's so good it doesn't need any peer review, no testing and just 1 day to write it, surely that = vastly superior to something that's been 1 year+ in the making and had 100+ developers looking over it and thousands of hours of testing.

people seem to think it'll automatically activate as soon as it hits 75%, it needs to hit 75% average from the last mining difficulty change to the next one, which I believe is about 2 weeks (dont quote me haven't checked), it's not a one day thing.
There is 1,311 blocks left in this period, SW needs 1,604 blocks to activate, so earliest it can activate is in about 3 weeks time, after the ending of the next period.

yes they can send pre fork coins, it's really very simple when a coin forks. At the exact block it forks you have to imagine an exact copy and paste is made of the ledger so every address and balance now exists on two different chains. They are separate entities so you can carry on using your Bitcoins freely, it doesn't matter if it's pre fork or post fork, Bitcoin is still it's own ledger doing it's own thing. If you move Bitcoins around nothing changes on the new fork, the coins stay where they were at the time of the fork, because it's a separate ledger not connected to Bitcoin it's literally on its own doing it's own thing. If you want to move coins on the fork you have to load their software and use their addresses and actually transact on their chain.
So yes Coinbase can do what they want with pre fork coins, it has no bearing on the new Bcash fork, they are separate, moving Bitcoins will not have any effect on forked coins, they will still sit in the address they were in when the fork occurred.

"On April 3, Purse CEO and founder Andrew Lee proposed a new idea for scaling called extension blocks (EXT-B/ E-blocks). The E-blocks code has been submitted to Github with a proposal written by Christopher Jeffrey, Joseph Poon, Fedor Indutny, and Stephen Pair."
Poon is one of the main guys who is/was working on making extension blocks a reality. Extension blocks is a concept due to Jihan needing a solution built around allowing the exploit to remain active.
The main point is that jihan didn't go to the BU devs, so they're useful idiots, to try and build anything of any use he looks elsewhere,

it's because miners are only thinking for themselves, being selfish doesn't match with what is best for Bitcoin to evolve. Miners seem determined to fight evolution all the way to safegaurd their own selfish agenda.
And so here we are, stagnation for the forseeable future.
The sad irony is that miners seem happy to have $800 Bitcoin rather than $2000 Bitcoin just so they can have the rules their way, which is so stupid to destroy your own business revenue.
Are there any other industries where companies attack themselves and their own income and effectively start to destroy themselves out of pure stubbornness?

It really depends if you're talking about a couple of miners or some serious $$$ to make a large scale mining operation. Free electricity is obviously a good ingredient for creating something large scale and it wouldn't be in China which is also a bonus.
If you were serious about something I would contact Bitfury, they're the 3rd largest mining pool and based in Georgia and they produce mining equipment. That would be the best place to go if you were looking at a serious operation.

well, to prevent double spends further back in the chain screwing you over, you need to just wait for a few confirmations before doing anything with the funds. If it had 3 or 4 confirms then you know it's yours and safe in your wallet. I'm not 100% sure if they can double spend with 1 confirm or if it's only possible with 0 confirms but I always wait for 3+ to then move coins onwards or release coins if I'm selling to someone.

Click buy and type in how much you want and wait for the trader to reply to you, then you guys just chat and if youre happy send the £10 online bank transfer to the details he gives you. Most good traders will reply instantly and when they see the £10 arrive in their bank account they'll release the coins.

The link you provided is one such evidence, so let's read what the developer of a coin has to say
"You wouldn't believe the amount of work it took for me to convince them to actually come to the negotiating table" developers having to bend over backwards just to get miners to talk to him, exactly one of the problems i was talking about.
"convincing one miner/pool at a time" so a successful decentralized coin is one who has developers go round each miner and have to persuade them to upgrade the protocol? not exactly a great system is it?
It's clear from his writing that things are backwards, developers should not be the ones running around trying to persuade miners to upgrade and seek their approval and have to work overtime just to get them to talk.
You basically posted the evidence that backs up my point.

great, we had to get a crazy chinese mafia dictator as the  miner didn't we, couldn't be a person just wanting to support Bitcoin and enjoy becoming hugely rich very easily, we had to get a total nutbag. If you add in the a narcissitic sociopath we have a real fine combination there, who would've thought a duo like that wouldn't win over the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:29:14
had no choice?  Lee even wrote about how hard it was for him to even get the mienrs to agree to a meeting, he was literally bending over for them begging for them to meet him and activate SW. If you read his writing you will see very clearly who's in control and it certainly isn't Charlie Lee.
Now there is a Jihan led "roundtable" that the ltc developers have a appeal to to get any future upgrades installed.
you should read the whole story, from Lee himself.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:14:07
my 2 cents.
Bitfinex's bank accounts weren't "locked up", their accounts are totally fine and process deposits/withdrawls fine with other Taiwanese banks. The issue is with the Taiwanese bank itself and the US intermediary banks implementing stricter rules that now places Taiwanese banks outside of these rules, so they stop doing business with them.
The ETF decision review is like any simple appeal/review process,  which I feel is almost like a "default setting" and really doesn't mean anything special. I would be gobsmacked if they reversed the decision.
I don't think it's all linked together. ETF will still get refused and bitfinex are trying to find banking partners who the US middlemen will do business with.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:20:12
Jihan will always agree to stop being a cunt if you hand him complete control of the coin, he hasn't backed down, completely the opposite, he now has control of Litecoin and any decision on upgrades must seek approval of his government.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:21:39
oh so the miners should be allowed to install a governing body that speaks for the entire community and the users should have no say whatsoever as to if this roundtable gets installed or not.

"Why the hell would you think that the public gets to vote on what these private entities do with their OWN mining equipment"

because how far along was a UASF? less than 5%, you can't say it was going to happen when it hadn't even got off the ground, we don't know for certain a UASF would happen do we? It would have been great if it did but it isn't actively being developed or pushed by developers. 
Jihan got what he wanted, UASF threat made them play their hand sooner, but in the end he got what he wanted.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:28:26
I really want to know why he thinks what he's doing is going to benefit his company in the long run. He's literally making the entire community that made his company worth more than zero hate him, it's so bizarre, the more obvious he makes it the more I just wonder what his real plan is. I've never known something make somebody rich and then they turn around and attack that very thing into potentially making their company worthless, it's just nuts.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:17:50
Today Litecoin died and in it's place arose dictator coin.
The developers of LTC allowed a very small group of chinese dictators to install themselves, without any vote or approval of users, as a controlling government.
From now on, developers of LTC wishing to implement changes must seek approval from this self installed government. 
Just look at this title: "Litecoin Global Roundtable Secretary General"
So it's a sad day, but it's clear that all the LTC supporters literally only care about price and not about the coin itself.
LTC has allowed itself to be seized by Jihan and his very small crew of people, they now control LTC and satoshilite has to ask for their approval before any future upgrades can be made.
I seriously hope Bitcoin never lets this happen.
So much for decentralized crypto......

Bitcoin hodler doesn't want Bitcoin price to sky rocket.

@_date: 2017-04-21 12:36:50
Prior to SW there was no governing body, Charlie Lee wrote himself how hard he has had to work, how much work he has put in just to try and persuade miners to vote for SW, he's basically begging miners to implement developer changes.
That is not  healthy future if you have to beg miners to install upgrades. 
Miners and their friends then create their own "not voted in" "not approved by users" roundtable government and tell Lee he must go to China and speak to them, they decide to do it all online to save time.
End of story, Lee presents himself in front of this self installed governing body, and they agree to install SW after discussions.
Now litecoin has a governing body led by Jihan wu and any furute developments must seek apporval from the governing centralized body.
LTC cheerleaders only care about getting SW activated and the price of the coin, they don't care if they have to hand control of it over to the miners.

bullshit, miners are paid to do a job and if they don't like it they can go somewhere else, users will never be held hostage by a small group of miners. It's about time miners learnt their place. If literally one or two people can dictate what Bitcoins rules are, when they have zero technical ability or knowledge, then Bitcoin has totally failed. Miners are a problem that needs dealt with, either by UASF or a POW change, miners do not rule Bitcoin.

All transactions do get broadcast but if you're trading goods/services etc always wait for 2 or 3 confirmations before you think of the money as yours.

For whatever reason the person double spent on you.

making a BU exchange seems strange, there's already an abundance of them on the scene, and that even goes for just Chinese exchanges offering overseas exchange, so there really is no need for a BU made exchange. If you add to that the fact that no one supports BU and most people hate them then it's really not a good idea.
The only thing I can think of is to do with laundering their money and making this exchange to  facilitate the different Jihan mining companies to "come together" and share/split funds undetected and offshore. This is probably more like a "BU mining operations coins for sale website."

There is a gigantic difference between a developer going to a meeting  and seeking approval from miners who make the decisions and two equal groups going into meetings to debate each other and try to come to equal agreement.

no one in Bitcoin will ever be jealous that a group of people installed themselves as a governing body without any approval by users or the community.
You seem to want "what's best for both coins" at any cost and if that means allowing groups of people to install themselves as governing bodies then that's fine as long as the price goes up.

read up on double spends, but from a quick look it looks like it's only unconfirmed transactions that can be double spent, ie someone sends the same funds to two different places, but as soon as one of them gets 1 confirmation the other one is deleted/rejected. With any situation when you are sending money on or someone is trying to buy from you it's best to wait for a couple of confirms before you do anything.

Loaded signed a message from his 40k wallet and Ver couldn't even do that, people claim he has so many Bitcoins yet he can't even prove ownership, so no Ver didn't "show up" he didn't even show proof of funds as loaded did.

I'm almost certain there are two parallel universes that have collided, there seems to be 2 very distinct sides on everything you see on the internet, all debates /arguments etc and both sides driving themselves insane wondering why the other side doesn't get it.

@_date: 2017-09-24 01:17:38
yes, never give up anything without a transaction id so you can check things for yourself, there's no need to take any chances with Bitcoin, it's all proven right there on the ledger. Once it has maybe 1-3 confirms (whatever you're comfortable with) then it's all good to conclude a deal.
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:00:19
it's better but still way out. A 98 s/byte fee is at least 10x what i would pay and saying it's economic and a 2hr average is way out as well. I'd expect a 98 fee to be accepted within 3 blocks , usually one or two.
You certainly wouldn't say 105 = 10mins but 98 = 2hrs , they're virtually the same.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:53:33

as someone else has posted, can't you trade in euros instead of btc? On Bitfinex you can specify to buy an amount of bitcoins or you can switch it so you specify you want to spend an amount of dollars, it's your choice if you work in btc or dollars. I'd be surprised if Kraken didn't do the same thing, you can say you want to spend x amount of euros to 2 decimal places, that should get you what you need
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:18:13
general rules for bch = transfer your bitcoin to a new address so they are safe. Download electron cash, import your now empty old private key and you should see your bch balance, you can then transfer it to an exchange and sell them.
Lumens finished Aug 27th so can't claim them anymore but BCH is the best freebie anyway, 0.13 free btc for every 1 btc held at time of fork

sweeping an address is just emptying it into a new wallet. In the case of brainwallets people used weak passwords so some people went to great effort trying to get access to weak wallets to sweep them. Once someone gains access and takes your btc there's nothing the origal owner can do. It's just basically hacking a weak password wallet and emptying it.

There's not many out there thinking about going to farmers markets to rip off a stall for a few bucks. The transaction will show on the blockchain after a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:47:56
since segregated witness came out you have the choice between two types of address to use. SW is the better bet as the fees are generally slightly lower, it's the scaling upgrade rolled out not long ago. If you're unsure I'd suggest just create a normal address like you did before. The important thing is to move the coins into a new paper wallet so you can use the old private key, it doesn't matter if it's a standard address or a SW address, doing what you know and feel comfortable with is more important. The main point with SW is that you can fit lots more transactions in one block so it helps to reduce the queues which help to bring fees down but, like i said, sorting out your BCH is an issue in itself so if it's easier just keep it simple with a normal address.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:24:13

the thing i like about my hardware wallet is that once your back up seed is very securely stored you can wipe the device completely, then it's like your coins don't exist anywhere physical and it's impossible for anyone to touch them, they literally only survive thanks to a backup seed, I find it quite strange to think about, it's like they don't exist anywhere but they do.

it's never usually the buyer who gets their acc shut down, it's the seller, usually for running a business from their personal account. You would simply be transferring money from one acc to another, there would be no indication you're buying bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-24 01:04:52
when you actually imported the key into a bch wallet did you actually notice if it gave you the exact address that you had on blockchain? A backup can lead to 2 different addresses (1 compressed and 1 uncompressed)
When i first loaded my key into electroncash it gave the wrong address so showed a 0 balance, i had to use bitaddress.org to see the two different priv keys and get the right one.
read about it here, especially the lower part. (ignore the omniwallet mentions, it's the same for BCH wallets)

Bitmain want to increase the block size from 1mb to 2mb. SW alters the way transactions are dealt with, so we can keep the block size at 1mb but add 2mb worth of transactions which makes SW better and yes Bitmain blocks are larger as it's a simple 2mb v 1mb block

There was the other scam that fell apart not long ago. They claimed to invest peoples money into bitcoin but they never did, the media still had a whale of a time calling it a bitcoin scam, when it had nothing to do with bitcoin at all apart from the scammers using bitcoin as their "this is how we make ridiculous returns"
With that scam they claimed to have x amount of customers and x amount of money invested, but the truth turned out to be about 1% of what they actually claimed
I am 99% certain that this MMM nonsense probably has about the same or even less a % of what they claim. Their figures will be utter nonsense and i doubt they have even 1% of what they claim

btc will just do away as usual, bcc will be dumped to the ground. Think about it, if you give away 16m coins for free after creating an order book with wafer thin bid support, creating a phantom value like $300 each, people will fall over themselves trying to get the most money they can. If someone has 1,000btc  there wont be $300,000 free money waiting for them, it'll be whatever scraps are left on the table. the only way $300 is a valid value is if there's hundreds of millions of dollars available for people to cash out and there isn't. If only 1m coins were sold this altcoin would need to have $300m of bid support to hold their $300 value. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:28:38
you missed the point entirely, the coins were laundered through btc-e long before that so you cant say they let Alex do it knowing hundreds of thousands had been hacked from mt gox, because at that time no one knew it had been hacked. It doesn't stop them being complicit in money laundering though.

proof of work is about the worst possible example to use. One person controlling 50% of hash rate doesn't mean an idea has 50% support, it means one person supports it.
Your entire statement is a good example of why most people are on the other side of the fence to you, your reasoning holds no water and is the usual type of response one gets from a side that has no factual foundation or pillars to lean on. I'm not sure how much success you'd have telling people they should move to bigger blocks because they're blind followers and need authority to control them.

if you've been buying/selling a substantial sum using a personal bank account they may deem the amounts too high and see you as using a personal account to run business like activites, that's the usual reason for closing personal accounts.

the point is that etc did'nt start with a falsely inflated value of $300+ , if it had then etc would've been dumped to the ground as well. etc started off as any split coin should, which is having a value of almost nothing and building from there.
I would counter that it's pretty naive to assume that a coin with a wafer thin order book will be able to give away 16m coins and start life with a value of $300 and hold it, it would require tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bids to support it.
If bcc started from almost nothing I wouldn't say it would be dumped to the ground because it would be much closer to a real value, but if they intend to start life claiming it's worth $300+ each then yes it will get dumped to the ground. If someone with 1,000btc is handed $300,000 of free money on a plate it's not naive to think they would look to cash that out. So, etc and bcc cannot be compared because one started from a genuine value and one is starting from a completely fake wafer thin value.
"next thing you know it's worth $10 on august 3rd" - well, if it goes from $300 to $10 then i would say that equals "dumped to the ground".
"if it's worth a penny on August 2nd" - I dont know what you would call going from $300 to a penny is but I certainly would call that dumped to the ground.

You'd think at some point that even Jihan Wu would realise that fighting over power is pointless if you burn the thing to the ground first. It's insane that he's destroying the worth of his own company over a power trip. Will he be happy if Bitcoin becomes old news and everyone goes off into permanent alt world? That's what he's driving people into right now. If he doesn't pull his finger out his ass soon, the damage will be done and he can kiss the price of Bitcoin goodbye, then what is he going to do with thousands of bricks that lose him money and with a company that no one buys asics from?
"Bitmain has more to lose than Core does" - so very true

I seriously hope you get it back without too much fuss, it's outrageous, ok if you broke their terms they can tell you take your stuff and leave but happily potentially ruining your life and taking your savings, it's just wow.

Viabtc's exchange started trading the futures 
within minutes and less than 200btc of trading they pumped the price to 9k yuan and made sure an article was written about it in the cryptonews stating how it was valued at $14b and would be the 3rd placed crypto, it was quite amusing. 
So, right now it's $413 and they like to tell us it's a legit market cap, but considering the split hasn't happened yet and there'll be over 16m coins given away I struggle to agree that $413 will represent their true value. If just 1m of the 16m coins are sold they'd have to find 413 million dollars of bid support to maintain it.
The ironic thing is, if they'd done as you said and started from pennies they'd probably find a bit of genuine support, people would see it as a low risk gamble and worth a punt, the price would rise a little bit and people would cheer it as they'd look to pump their investment.

good luck expanding in China, I'll be interested to see how that plays out. 
one interesting point in the article:
"through a partnership with Galaxy Dragonfly Investments Co. Ltd, a bitcoin mining company. Under the agreement, the Beijing-based firm will provide Bitpoint with a stable supply of bitcoins."
I love the way Bitcoin halves every 4 years.It'll be interesting to see large companies consuming the entire mining supply if they can. A company that has a contract to buy direct from a miner could become valuable and I wouldn't be surprised to see companies taken over because one of their prized assets is a lucrative mining contract for the supply of coins.

Each bank is different though, Barclays said I would get my money back no problem at all, just write to this address.... so I write to the address never heard a single word back, and it just so happens this "department" has no website section with braclays or phone number or anything, dodgy as hell imo. I could've / should've just sued them to get the money back but I just left it in the end.
I would get legal advice, my feelings are that they can close your account anytime they like with valid reason but they have no right to steal your money. They can't show anything to say what you did was illegal or anything, you just broke their rules. This sort of case must happen all the time, I would seek legal advice because I think you'll get your money back if you fight for it, they have no right to steal your money because you didnt do anything illegal, selling bitcoins isn't illegal.
