Thanks dude, same to you!

Hey dude - I think i might be having a similar issue. I noticed on my banking statement that Coinbase charged me for $120.48, which was the amount I had in their USD Wallet. I initially set this amount to be transfered back to my checking account, but when I noticed how long it would take I canceled that transaction by moving that money to GDAX.
I had bought ~$330 worth of BTC that I have moved to my wallet. Reviewing my checking statement this number adds up. However if I included the $120.48 charge the number goes up to $450 and I do not, nor have I bought $450 worth of BTC.
I contacted support and they told me this:


If i had initiated a sell, shouldn't I be credited for $120 and not charged for it?
After having explained to them my thoughts above, they replied with the following:


Having investigated the issue, I am working with a specialist to address it properly. We will follow-up with you as soon as we have an update.
Now my name is not Matt, so I'm hoping support had a brain fart and they're not mixing up my ticket with another person.
Will keep you posted as this develops.

UPDATE: Here is the update as promised. Coinbase has credited me back with the amount that was charged to my checking account. I received no email explaining why/what happened, just saw that the monies were credited to my bank account.  Hope you've figured yours out.

Thanks for the quick reply! So it sounds like you're better off holding onto your private keys than risking the exchange having the control in hopes that B2X will have some profit?

Thats essentially the position I'd want to be in. If I'm able to pay down all of my student debt in ~10 years time using BTC alone I'll be very happy.

Thanks for clarifying this for me!

What I truly want...is to pay off my student debt :| I've got two degrees (BA, MA),  and I've been out of work since May, but the banks are not giving a fuck they just want more money.

So if you've purchased coins on Coinbase/GDAX which you store on another wallet, you'll get your B2X on these exchanges for having purchased BTC through them? Or does BTC have to be on the exchanges to benefit from B2X?

Would you be able to point me (and the rest of the uninformed masses) to info or a guide on how exactly this is done? If the BTC purchased on GDAX/Coinbase/etc are kept in a wallet where only we control the private keys - how can I get the new hardforked coins?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:09:28
So by keeping our btc on Electrum, how might someone exactly choose what happens (and try to benefit from the b2x fork)?

Send the coins from Coinbase to GDAX, and from GDAX to anywhere else. GDAX has no transaction fees.

Upvoted for visibility! Good luck mate.

BTC transactions were backlogged due to yesterday's BCH attack. They've just started unclogging and it should speed up. Thats my understanding.

Looking for advice on buying 'sudden' dips! I was wondering how some of you buy BTC (when a dip occurs) without annoying fees. Its well known that you can Instant Buy BTC on CoinBase using your debit card, but this transaction comes with a fee that increases with how much BTC you actually buy.
I've discovered recently that you can transfer your coin off GDAX for free, which is great - but I'm still curious how I can quickly move the USD from my bank accounts onto the exchange without 1. Instant Buy fees and 2. With no/little wait time of a bank deposit.
I'm still relatively new to bitcoin but the only way I can think of is to deposit the money from my bank account onto an exchange (GDAX) and keep it there until a dip occurs. I'm not entirely confident on keeping my money on the exchanges however.

I too am wondering about this. The best info i've found since asking the similar question is that Coinbase dictates what happens to your BTC since they have your private keys when you sore your money with them. Would like some clarification as well! Is there any way to get the B2X to sell without giving up my private keys?
