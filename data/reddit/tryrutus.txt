I am also from Europe, I use bitstamp and it works fairly well. I recommend it ! Of course it asks for an identity proof to deposit funds from your Bank Account (proof of residency, ID Card, address and I think that's all). And it does the change from Euros to Dollars at the day to day rate.

Yeah I think I'm going to spend 50€ on it and see how it goes for like 1hour/1day/3days/1week. I'm already making my own decisions but I really don't just to waste my money on a stupid placement of mine :) (thanks to you and the others I understood that this was really something serious)

Much shibe, very doge, such money

I'm looking at it as a sort of "life experiment", I am not thinking this could get me rich or this should be easy money. I am working hard to become an "economy mathematician" and I think using bit coin and learning a bit more about an isolated trade center would be a win for me (and a win-win if I invest wisely and make profit). I just don't want to run for it unprepared :)

Will do it as soon as I'm back to a non-mobile device ! Thanks for reminding me.
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:09:09
But isn't the price going to get higher and higher because of it getting more used/popular ?
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:04:53
That was exactly what I was looking to read, thanks a lot ! You summed up a big part of many questions I had. I'm on my mobile at the moment so I can't check the sidebar neither my adress but I will ASAP ! :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:20:19
So like at a Trade Center ? But aren't BTC a bit more "safe" on their fluctuation ?
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:54:09
I'm all for advices, but why shouldn't it be ? I'm ready to hear your arguments (hope this doesn't provocative or anything similar).
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:32:23
C'est tellement futuristique Doc' !
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:45:16
Exactly what I'm looking for ! :D Ahah we've got a  confusing language
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:10:56
Great question, I think it would be between 50&amp;100€ to try it out and see what happens.

I have got my adress now here it is : 1FYjnHxsX3zrSTe3eVfM1sufrQs9cG47xK
Hope it works and a big thanks you for being the kind of persons who likes to help people out. (even though your answer is already enough)
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:10:08
Wow, thanks that's the clearest answers I could have gotten. All is there :D
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:19:01
*highfive* Don't rush it, gather as much information as you can. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:17:50
Ahah thanks man, great to know there are others people my ages who are interested in it ! I will check your website when I'm back to my computer :) 
+ I love the fact you even took the time to copy/paste on google translate (even though you don't need to, since I just have difficulties writing sentences which don!t sound like a 6 grader). Glad to know there are some Americans who learn Moliere's language :D
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:07:22
Okay that's what I needed to know, thanks for the websites and taking a bit of your time to help me out :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:34:54
Oh wow ! Thanks a lot man ! It's so much easier to make transaction with bitcoin ! Astonishing.

Does a paper wallet is a real wallet ? Isn't it less safe since I can lose it easier than an electronic wallet ?
