Have you read his update yet? If you read that and still believe his ridiculous story...I have no words.
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:30:10
Oh come on. Are you 13 years old?

It's really not. At all.

@_date: 2014-09-04 21:04:17
That is completely untrue.
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:04:01
I bet they wouldn't.

Go read up on socialism a little.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:16:09
you are so self-unaware it's hilarious.
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:49:55
Read the update, then you won't

I love that someone petulantly downvoted this comment.
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:29:06
They're easily confused.

That's not how banking works in England. We don't pay for debit cards nor do we pay for withdrawing cash from ATMs at other banks. It's all free.

@_date: 2014-12-24 09:53:12
I can't believe this is a real comment.

Picking up a dollar bill from the ground is much easier than collecting a 9c tip in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-25 10:13:19
The irony of your comment in this particular post...
@_date: 2014-05-12 12:35:48
@_date: 2014-10-18 15:07:56
Uh...do you really think that was a serious comment?
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:38:43
Jesus, really?

Africa is a continent with many nations, not one nation.
@_date: 2014-11-30 10:33:53
So, uh, has this big bitcoin revolution happened yet then? I must have missed it.

I'm white and me and my sister both use hair extensions. Several of my friends do too.  In the uk it's pretty common.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:25:23
It makes sense to you? A person from the future?
@_date: 2015-01-21 09:36:28
I'm British and we use "call" around here. Never hear people use "ring".
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:37:12
heh. maybe!
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:59:39
Only in the US. I have never paid any fee for a bank account in the UK.

You don't actually know what exponential means. Go look it up.
@_date: 2015-07-15 10:52:20
So if you don't know anything about N Korea, how are you able to state it's superior to the USA? 
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:07:34
Angola begs to differ.
