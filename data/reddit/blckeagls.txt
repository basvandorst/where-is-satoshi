LN transfers the an on chain transaction signed bytes between participants.  This way it doesn't hit the block chain, freeing up space for on-chain transactions.  Doesn't make sense to record every $1.25 purchase forever on the blockchain.  
LN solves this by lumping every small transaction into one on-chain transactions, saving tons of space that would essentially be stored for ever.
Lightning network does not actually transfer the value until a channel closes.  It's basically distributed accounting. 
It's trustless because of the following.
Lets say you sell coffee for $1.25.  Today I buy 1 cup for $1.25.  So I send you the transaction code for $1.25.  Then tomorrow I buy another cup, then I send you the transaction code for $2.50 ($1.25 for yesterday, $1.25 for today).  If you choose to close the channel for the $1.25 yesterday, you lose the $1.25 today, so basically you throw away the $1.25 from yesterday, and keep the $2.50 from today.

Or ideas that are good but havent been proven wont get funding.  Those ideas will never get a chance.
Investing is used to generate a return.  I invest 10btc I hope to get back more than 10.  In deflationary systems they becomes alot harder.  With this increased difficulty people are going to not try on things unless they are pretty certain.
Many medical advances takes billions in failed investments before they can find something that works.  On top of years or research.
Bu the time it makes it to market, it will be almost impossible to make a return in a deflationary system.

How do you dollar cost average down when your cost basis per coin is $0 (sold some for profit at high)?  
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:07:10
9 btc has the same buying power as 10 btc in 5 years at a 2% deflation.
The investor of 10 btc in a company that does not increase growth for 5 years not has 9btc worth of ownership.  He would be better off not having inveted.
Price isn't "easier" to buy because price went down.  Those peoples wages went down too.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:11:32
2% growth is easy in a system of 2% inflation.  All you hav to do is have really nothing change.
In deflation, you have to cut your prices and pay employees less to account for the -2% cost of living because your currency is valued 2% higher.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:17:39
2% growth is hard in today's inflationary system where they can increase the prices of their goods.

You will only invest in a company if you see a possibility of a return on your investment.  If a company cant grow to recoup your investment you wont invest.

Why purchase a house?  It would be better to rent.  But then why buy rental properties if the rent will go down every year vs up?
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:30:20
I see where you are going with this but you fail to recognize that people will pretty much not be willing to give out a loan or purchase stock to support a business unless they can make their money back in less than 5 years.    
At a 2% deflation, 10BTC investment will only be worth 9BTC in 5 years if that business just maintains what it's doing.  This means every business would need to somehow gain 2% growth every year while having to cut prices and costs for cost of living reasons.  
You realize a deflationary currency would completely ruin company stocks? The only companies worth investing in would be new start-up that are in the growth phase, and only probably a very select few.  Who would invest in AT&amp;T?  They can't maintain a 2% growth rate (especially with them having to cut their prices to match Cost-of-living in a deflationary currency).  
98% of all businesses will have less revenue year over year in deflationary currency type economy.  Not to say their "value" as related to purchasing power, but their stock price/valuation will be lower every year.

1. Gold is not a deflationary currency. At least a far as we can tell. When prices rise, there is alot more people finding more. Look at oil an shale fracking.
2. I am not saying we need a government fiat currency. I am saying we shouldn't have thing priced in bitcoin, I think it would hinder innovation. Yes there will still be innovation, but many ideas will end up in the garbage because people cant get the funding to bring them to life.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:34:06
Re-looked at my calculation, i did it by month vs year.  Your are correct on the pricing.  
but I was never advocating government printed money in fact it said hopefully not government controlled in original statement.  I think that a inflation adjusted crypto would be better for pricing.  but you do bring up some good points.
-- Why do you think you "earn 43.36 BTC over 100 years"?
Because a person who works for 1BTC/year today then gets deflated at 2% over 100 years will earn a total 43.36 BTC.  You have to take into account opportunity cost.
But there is differences in how an economy will work with deflationary and inflationary system.  Investing is incentivized in an inflationary currency and savings is incentivized in a deflationary currency. 
In both systems your investments need to overcost that cost associated.  In a deflationary system hard assets like gold, land, and homes depreciate in value.  In an inflationary system, hard assets like gold, land, homes, etc appreciate in value.
Unless what you own is producing value or income, it is a bad asset.  There is no reason for someone to own their own home, it's better to pay rent, at least financially.  In a decentralized system, pretty much no one would buy a house except for investment reasons because people would need to get a loan.
After some more thought into this, the only way I could see this working is with a deflationary type loan scheme, where you pay higher amount up front and the payments lower over the years. Also interest rates would be lower, probably close to 1%, but would probably require a larger down payment.
Lets say it a home cost 20BTC.  In a conventional loan, the payment would be 0.77 BTC/yearly.  But in a deflationary loan type, payment would start at 1.017 BTC/yearly and in 30 years end up at 0.5661 for the last year (taking 1.017BTC and deflating @ 2% per year).  The total paid on both of these loans would be 21.1BTCs over 30 years, but one is affordable in the long run, and one is not. 
Conventional @ year 1 = 19.25% of income
Conventional @ year 30 = 34.5% of income
Deflation Adjusted Loan @ year 1 = 25.4% of income
Deflation Adjusted Loan @ year 30 = 25.0% of income
@_date: 2019-07-08 00:58:26
For alot of what you said is correct.  My 5% might be too high, but 1% is too low.
One thing I disagree with if reading correctly is that houses keep their value.  If you mean as purchasing power, yes.  If you mean price, no.
Bitcoin is deflationary with respect to purchasing power, not supply.  I is a fixed supply (at least in 100 years it will be).
Even with 2% deflation buying anything will pretty much be a loser.  Long term loans will pretty much be non existent as wages will goes down due to cost of living going down and payments will end up being a higher percentage of their income.  It will be more riskier for the lender due to this and the collateral being worth less.
I get that 1 BTC today will the same purchasing power as .98btc next year. But where is the incentive to lend?

Only really real world use to a blockchain is proving ownership of digital assets.  People have all of these ideas that it could help.  But without incentivization no one will run anything to make it decentralized.  Why run a blockchain that is expensive and slow when you can just run a database that is fast and cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:41
Block chains are only useful for the following reasons.  Otherwises, it's better to just use a centralized database because it's cheaper and faster:
- Need a distributed trust model to prevent double spending
- Need to prove ownership in a distributed trust model
- Need an open ledger for accountability that is not controlled by the entity needing to use the ledgers (for oversight of governments is one example)

I think LN is the way to go for really large scaling.  But there will eventually need a block size increase.
Here is one of my worries about LN.  What if I close a channel after making transactions, and the mempool is full for &gt;2 weeks and that doesn't get processed?  What happens to that channel?  I assume it just gets re-broadcasted?
This is part of the reason we will eventually need block size increases.

Your gains in mining is relative to the amount you invest into machines to mine.  Most people who start mining don't take into account the increase in difficulty that happens over time due to more miners coming in.
According to: 
1 Ant Miner S9 will produce a little less than 1 BTC in 1 year.  But that does not take into account the 5-10% difficulty increase every 2 weeks and the $800/year on electricity.

For every short there has to be an equal long.  If everyone wants to short bitcoin and no one wants to go long. No one can make a future contract.
Future shorts will take their money from future longs. Future longs will take their money from future shorts.  There are two institutional investors who have equal incentive for it to go both ways.  This cancels it out.
This FUD going on saying these scary banks and institutional investors is what they want.  They are playing you to go their way.  They want you to sell so they make money on their shorts.  Let the market do what it does, it will eventually go back up or back down.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:01:11
I guess kinda, not exactly following you 100%..   But with futures, there is no asset that is being bought or sold.  It is basically two people coming to an agreement, or a "bet", that one is saying it will go up, and the other saying it will go down.   So no one person can short it forever, it requires equal amount of people on the other side to take those shorts.

There is three things that will matter in the survival after the "crash".
1. Sizeable network use

3. Name recognition
I think litecoin, ethereum, bitcoin will definately survive the onslaught of the ICOs and alts that is coming.
All of the main features these ICOs have will be implemented onto bitcoin eventually.  They just don't have the security or use that bitcoin has.  Bitcoin is going to be the one of the first to have multiple things built that will actually take hold.

Most Institutional Investors cannot buy bitcoin.  They don't have a regulated market to do so in.  They have to buy futures, which has no influence on the supply or demand of BTC, therefore no direct economic influence on the price of BTC. 
They can't just make shorts and sell bitcoins..  They are not allowed to invest their money directly into BTC.  They would have to convince a third party to pout downward pressure on the market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:37:44
Yea, they are sold out of BTC miners, or maybe they are just mining it themselves.  Been good for me, although it would have been better off to just buy the BTC to begin with than spend it on the miner.

If you buy a short contract you will be matched with someone who wants to buy a long contract.  If there is no long contract, you will have no short contract until someone matches with you.

I see this being challenged in US Courts as unconstitutional.  Violates at a minimum the 5th amendment, and possibly the 1st amendment.
Violation of First Amendment:
Previous court cases has rules money and cryptocurrency is a speech.  They are basically forcing you to state your beliefs.  Let's pass a law that everyone has to register their religion with the Government.  Lets pass a law where you have to disclose all your online user names.  See where I am going?
Violation of 5th Amendment:
Protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.  By forcing everyone to disclose what they own, it violates this amendment as there is no warrants issued.  Again, instead of bitcoin, let's use contraceptives (birth control). If you have birth control in your home (condoms, pills, etc.) you will have to let the government know what brand and how much of these contraceptives you have.

No. What you are saying is you are rewriting a transaction on the blockchain.  You are changing the output of a transaction to a seperate wallet.  Giving me a wallet with funds on it doesn't prove much.  I would like to see that it has changed or that you have access to a "lost/stolen" wallet.  This should be easy by just finding a transaction and posting a link to it and signing a message to prove you own that wallet.

I don't think very few control the most amount of bitcoin.  Other alts have a lot less people with them most ownership.

Wars are funded by taxpayers.  They are able to get around having to ask tax payers today for money because they will just tax them by devaluing their money.

This only happens because they can just borrow the money and not really ever have to pay it back (i.e. print money).

I think your going to be surprised thinking this is going to dip because of future shorts...  It might dip because of the "buy the rumor sell the news" but there is no money to be made from the futures by purposefully selling tons of bitcoins. 
The futures are not traded in bitcoin, they receive no bitcoins, they don't even use bitcoin, it's just linked to the price.  They are limited in the number of individual shorts/longs they can place, and for every short someone has to match the long.   The institutions can't just load up on shorts, that short money comes from the people doing longs..  The interest in it going lower is the same interest in it going higher, they will cancel each other out.

I agree with this.  It depends on what causes the recession.  If it's a failure of fiat and run away inflation, BTC should be bullish.
If it's economic downturn and people getting fired or something like this, that isn't really related or appears to be related (in the eyes of the larger population) fiat issues, BTC will probably be bearish because people will sell if they need the fiat to cover expenses.
It really all comes down to how will it affect the Demand of BTC.  Do people want BTC over FIAT or FIAT over BTC?

Second, They are not "Banks".  They can't touch your money, they are merely a "router", just like internet routers.  They can't lend your money, they can't freeze your account.
Third, it's better than 200MB+ blocks which is what will be needed for BCash to scale if they were ever to need VISA level transactions.  This might "Centralize" transactions via "Hubs", but it's better than centralizing the mining, which is what bigblocks do.
Fourth, Governments can't "Regulate" HUBs, the transactions are kept secret and the "Hubs" don't really know who is getting paid unless they are actually part of the transaction.

I have no idea what you are saying.  What do you mean "Sent from the blockchain"? That doesn't make sense.  Are you trying to guess the answer for blocks in the future, i.e. not the next block? You do realize that is what PoW prevents right?  You need to know the previous blocks to get the next block. 
There is only 2 ways to get bitcoins: from an existing wallet, or mining the next block. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:30:14
Maybe, if we could implement a system that can increase the block size but cut out "spam".  Problem is, with cheap space, people will add data that is not needed.  If you have a 10mb block with 1 satoshi fee on a widely used blockchain, 9mb of that will be used to add data to transactions like messages or transaction data.
Maybe it will increase size more than 1mb and only include transactions where fees are &gt; 25% of the past 200 block average?

&lt;Edit&gt; People think money has some magical properties that no other good has, which is not true, it has the exact same economical properties as every other good. &lt;/Edit&gt;
There are really only 2 factors that effect inflation:
- Supply of Money
- Demand of Money
If the supply stays the same, but people don't want it, the valuation of it drops, causing inflation.  
If the supply increases, and the demand stays the same, it's valuation drops, causing inflation.
The US Dollar is rising in valuation to other currencies despite "printing" more. This is because there is a demand for the US Dollar since there are several other currencies starting to go into a crisis at the moment.  The demand is out weighing the supply of the US Dollar.
Venezuela is getting hit on both sides.  Increasing supply and dropping in demand, thus causing the hyperinflation.
The printing of money is directly related to Venezuela's socialist policies.  They guarantee things for their citizens but can't afford it because they don't bring in enough taxes.  To pay for these policies, they borrow or print more money causing the supply to increase.  This increase in supply and the world looking at venezuela's economy crapping out from these economic policies (lowering demand) is what is crashing their currency.  On top of the US Dollar denominated debt rather than Bolivar Denominated Debt.  This is why the US is basically the only country that can print their way out of debt, no other country can really do this. &lt;/Edit&gt;

To "solve" a block, you have to find an input using some aspects of the previous block that generates a hash that begins with *X* number of 0's.  By adding another 0 it increases the difficulty to find that answer.  When the answer is being found faster than it should over 2000 block (2 weeks) it increases the number of 0's that need to be found.
Lets say last 2000 blocks were ten 0's (00000000005EFG234...) but they were being solved in 7 minutes. After the 2000 block period, they would then need to solve eleven 0's (00000000000754EFAC2....)
Sha256 is a 256 bit string.
with 00000000005EFG234...(ten 0's) you have (2^256 - 2^80) / 2^256 chance of guessing a correct answer.
with 00000000000754EFAC2....(eleven 0's) you have (2^256 - 2^88) / 2^256 chance of guessing a correct answer.
*note:* the exponent is 8(bits) x number of 0's
*I am not sure if it uses the binary value of SHA256 or the string value of SHA256 for the number of 0's. it's probably binary since you can say 1-256 vs 1,2,4,8,16,32....*

Is it legal what they are doing? Yes.
Is it censorship? Yes.
You can censor someone and still be legally allowed to do it.  Facebook, Youtube, Google, Paypal all have a huge deal of power.  When they claim to be open and allow ideas to flourish but then stop someone from using their platform as it was intended it seems very much discriminatory (Still not illegal).  
No one here is suggesting it's illegal.  They are just saying it is not the right thing to do.  No one is calling for these companies to be forced to allow him.
What is really important to see here is it really isn't just going to be Alex Jones.  Watch, they will start doing it to more conservatives, eventually going from "Most Extreme" conservatives to "Moderate" Conservatives.  They literally want to make the world leftist because that's what they believe.  No one was asking these companies to ban him, they just did it.

Right... At this point I am pretty sure you are just trying to scam people one way or another.  Probably giving people some key logger or something when they "sign-up".  You have no grasp on how any of this works.  I asked for a transaction that shows some proof that you had access to a wallet, then you give me a transaction from a week ago and tell me to "look" further back.  How does that prove anything?
Your lack of understanding of how bitcoin works and your attempts to prove your system work has been flawed from the beginning.  You claim that you have done it and tested it, but yet cannot provide and factual proof.  Tell-tell signs of a scammer.

I agree, price can go down.  Short sellers / Margin Buyers can have a psychological effect on the market.  If the price goes down too much, might cause panic selling. If price rises too much from Margin Buyers, it can FOMO into higher prices.  But these are all temporary, and are dependant upon alot of factors.
What is true is for every BTC shorted, there eventually has to be a BTC bought back.  If the order book isn't deep enough on the buy back of a short seller, it causes a huge jump back up when they close their positions.  
In essence, a short seller has no real effect on the price in the long term, only in short term due to psychology and how big the order book is on the sell and the buy.  Only thing that really matters long term is the number of people who actually want to hold bitcoin and people who actually want to sell the bitcoin they own. Derivatives, shorts, and margins do not effect the market outside the short term psychological effects.  In fact, shorts and margins usually help with liquidity of the market, and in general some stabilization of price.

They have shown their colors that they are not about free speech.  Banning hate speech is completely against the principles of free speech.  I am not advocating that they should be forced to host people they disagree with, I just dont like how FB and Google claims to be a platform to share ideas and yet they do this.
I think this kind of action can make these companies more legally liable to what people say and use their services.  By banning one person, they are making the statement that they will control the narratives on their platform, which doesn't make the a content provider but more like a news network.

You can tax what isn't considered force, like sales tax, import tax, export tax.  This is one way to fund a government that is a little bit more moral.
There is really only 1 main purpose of a government.  That is to defend and protect your rights from people who try to infringe upon them.  It is not 100% necessary to have a government do this, people can do this themselves (lookup anarcho-capitalist).  
One of the biggest things people talk about is "Who will build roads?"..  I mean, if left to the free market, businesses will want roads to their business, people will want roads to get around.  Where there is a demand, there will be a market solution for it, especially with the technology today.
Roads would be so much better and alot less traffic if it was ran by for-profit companies without any interference from the government.  If there is a traffic jam, the business would probably expand the road to get more cars through to increase their revenue.  Governments don't care if there is traffic jams, they see roads as an unnecessary cost.  If there is a car accident, the road owners would be more likely to clear it up faster because it hurts their revenue by causing traffic and not allowing people to get on the road.

Very few things have intrinsic value.  Most people state that "gold" has intrinsic value.  Sure it does, can be used in manufacturing, etc...  But that intrinsic value is not ~$1300/oz...  it's probably more like $10/oz...   
If we could find a cheap and effective way to manufacture gold, gold would fall down to that low level because that is it's "Intrinsic Value"..
The only thing really with intrinsic value is Stocks, which is ownership in a company.
The USD, Yuan, etc have no intrinsic value.  It's value is determined upon the people who are willing to accept it.  
Even if tomorrow, Saudi, Iran, Venezuela, Kuwait, OPEC decided to only price Oil in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin still has no intrinsic value. 
Edit: Stock's value is generally much higher than it's "Intrinsic Value"....

Ok, so most of the country makes less than 350,000 SEK (~40K USD)...  And you expect them to purchase a house a 4.6M SEK (Average price in cheapest city in Sweden) which is roughly $500K USD?
$40K @ 25% Tax = $30K
Mortgage on $500K = $2000/month or $24,000/year
So they have $6000 to live off of for the whole year. 
Edit 2:
Lets add a married couple who both make the same...
$36K for a year, or $3,000/month after mortgage...
Lets say 66% or $2,000 is spend on taxable items...  So they have only $1500/month to spend on taxable items (before tax)...  and $1000 for utilities, food, etc....
So a family making $80K/year with no kids is basically barely living...

I think your world thoughts that people are enslaved by inflation is wrong.  I agree that there is theft from the future, but I don't think it's enslavement.  Prices rising doesn't enslave people, most people make more money every year through cost of living adjustments.
Fixed supply will make a completely different economic model where investments will be completely changed.  It will make people less likely to invest.  Investments are a good thing, it allows new ideas and projects to come forward.  Sure people can invest their time, but people only have so much time.  Eventually you need monetary investments to grow and capture the market, otherwise someone will copy you and make it to market faster who has that capital and time to invest. A completely different kind of theft.
To me your arguments are "Rich people bad, all they are trying to do is steal and enslave people".  I guarantee you that is not true, maybe a couple people, but not even close to the majority, in fact a small minority.  You have little arguments that follow logic but mere emotional arguments.
The arguments you do present are the ones I am arguing but then you put some emotionally charged statements and somehow that ends in a different outcome.
We agree that population will increase the purchasing power which is directly related to devaluing all products.  A home today will cost less tomorrow.  A business today will cost less to create tomorrow.  Labor today will be cheaper tomorrow.  But then you say people will invest money even though the deflation will make it hard to make a profit.
Here is a perfect example.
1. make 1 BTC/year working somewhere
2. buy a 100 tenant apartment complex for 100 BTC
1. Average wage is 1BTC/year
2. Most people will spend 25% of their pay on a place to live
3. 2% deflation in BTC value (2% increase in purchasing power) per year
If i choose opportunity 1:
1. I can keep 100 BTC
2. I can earn 43.36 BTC over 100 years
If I choose opportunity 2:
1. I spend 100 BTC
2. I earn 90.35 BTCs from Rent over 100 years.
3. It will take 200 years to make 102.3 BTC.
Which opportunity is better?
Lets say the price is lower, let say 25 BTC for a 100 unit apartment complex (which is unlikely if wages are an average of 1BTC/year), it would take 31 years to just be paid back including opportunity costs and no other expenses.

So your plan is to rewrite the entire blockchain until you beat the current chain and become the dominate chain?  You do realize what you're proposing is near impossible unless you invest trillions...
Would be cheaper and possibly easier to just bruteforce some of the private keys, at least you will have luck on your side doing this.
Edit: also, if they ever introduce a blockchain "snapshot" to reduce the total size of the blockchain, you will never be able to rewrite anything before that snapshot
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:28:53
Because that's how the blockchain works.  You can't change it..  That's why it's called "immutable".  You would have to do just as much work as all of the transactions after the one you want to change plus some more and then beat the current chain for these to take effect.  What you are proposing it "splitting" the chain and then at a later date bring it back in to become the "Dominate" chain according the the bitcoin code.
Edit: For illustration purposes here is how blocks work (not exactly, but close enough).  When I find the answer to block 5000 i have to include all transactions into block 5000 which and then hash this block.  That hash then becomes the "seed" to block 5001.  If I changes a transaction in block 5000, my hash will change for the seed.  Then I will have to do just as much work to mine block 5001, which will also change the "seed" for all other blocks after block 5001. 
1. SHA256(Answer to Block 5000 + Transactions) = Seed for block 5001
2. SHA256(Answer to Block 5001 + Transactions) = Seed for block 5002
3. ...
if you change a transaction then the seed changes, which changes the answer to the next block.

I wouldn't put any money into it unless you first understand what it is.
This is not a get rich quick scheme, you will not be a millionaire from a $100 investment.  You might make some good % gains, but most likely you will sell at some point before being a millionaire if it ever gets that high, so don't do this for that reason.
Look at Andreas Antonopoulos' videos and other peoples, then after you understand what it's all about, then you can decide if it's worth it to you.

Both are equally happy.  That's how markets work.  The seller has more benefit for $6000 than 1 btc.  The buyer decided he has more benefit for 1 btc than $6000. That's how the transaction happened.  The sell is happy no matter the outcome in the future or else he would not have sold.
Now if the buyer then sell for $12k he is happy because he believes $12k is more useful to him than 1btc.
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:40:36
Not true, speculation can raise prices without any buyers sellers.  Let's just say no one is willing to sell btc for less than $10k.  Immediately it will jump to $10k if there is someone willing to buy it.  It doesn't have to increase pennies at a time.
It could go to $100k instantly.  The likelihood is low in both scenarios, but it doesn't make it a zero sum game.  There can be wealth generated without a buy or sell to drive prices higher.

It is censorship. Facebook, Youtube, and paypal are censoring him.  Is it legal? Sure.  
Censorship = using power and influence to deprive someone of their ability to speak.  
In PayPal's case its financial censorship.  Meaning they are using their power and influence to deprive AJ of his ability to speak through financial cut off.  
They are 100% in their right to do so. But it looks bad imo on PayPal.  The facts that have been released and the actions of FB and Google really point out it's because they dont like what he is saying and not at all financially motivated.

Scandinavian countries are not socialist at all.  They have really high individual taxes and very low corporate taxes.  It's a society that says they are willing to pay for other peoples stuff.  
Tax Rates:
- Sweden: 
- Denmark: 
- Norway: 
None of their economies are controlled massively by the government. Corporations are pretty free in conducting business how they see. 
Socialism is that the government controls all or most of the means of production.  That means the government owns some or most of the companies and dictates how they run.  In no way is Scandinavia like this.  
Scandinavians are just willing to pay more personally to help other people in their society. Their businesses are not paying most of this.
But here are some downsides of living in Scandinavia:
Most people don't own a car because it cost too much. Most people don't own a house because it cost too much.  People are on waiting lists for years just to get an apartment inside a major city.
It's not all flowers and rainbows there...

I kind of agree with you on this.  LN is really only good for payments.  Not good for the exchanges as people will want their bitcoins in their wallet, and not in a channel.  People will want to open their own channels.  
I think we still need a MB increase + LN...  This is how you scale to visa transactions.  LN = Every day payments.  On-chain = Large fund transfers.
Most exchanges are doing large fund transfers, people are moving from software wallets to hardware wallets, then back to exchanges, then back to hardware wallet, etc...
Bitcoin isn't at the adoption where LN will be a huge impact on the transactions.  We need at some point a larger block size.  Not saying we need to rush into this but at some point it will be needed.

Because of the "halving" of the block rewards.
1st block reward total = 50(btc) x 210000 (blocks before halving)
2nd block reward total = 25(btc) x 210000
3rd block reward total = 12.5(btc) x 210000
4th block reward total = 6.25(btc) x 210000
5th block reward total = 3.125(btc) x 210000
It eventually ends up at about 21M by like 2150...

I mean technically in a free market, low interest rates would happen if banks had too much money and no one wanted to borrow money. Reduced demand for loans and  increased supply of money that can be loaned.

But to your point, more people saving would bring interest rates down as there is more money to lend.

Unless you live somewhere where there isn't a lottery.  Freedom is the ability to do something that cant be stopped. Freedom isn't that tou should or should not. It's the ability.

Look at Wikileaks and how they continue to be funded.  Crypto is literally the only thing they can accept from US Citizens.  That is why fiat is not freedom, bitcoin is. If tomorrow the government decided it didnt like you, it would block your cards and bank account. What do you do then?

I am not saying bitcoin is solving inflation (in terms of value/buying power) by fixing the money supply.  People like bitcoin because it means freedom.  Bitcoin though, by its nature should be deflationary in terms of supply but not buying power (in the long run).  Now for inflation (buying power), the demand is something no one can control, which is the additional place for inflation and deflation (in terms of buying power).  But what is known that with a fixed supply and increased demand of a unit of exchange its buying power increases, while with a fixed supply and decreased demand its buying power decreases.
So the moral of the story is that bitcoin is a medium of exchange where you get freedom.  While predicting the inflation or deflation of its buying power solely comes mainly from peoples demand for it.  If you can increase demand you will increase buying power.
If you could get everyone on this subreddit to buy $20/week of bitcoin (and hodl) you would see the price jump up nice pretty quickly. But that will be near impossible to get everyone to do this.  
What you can do is look to the future and make some educated guesses about what the future holds. I see most western governments usurping power and alienating peoples rights more and more.  Increased levels of civil unrest throughout the world. I think we are slowly coming to a tipping point. I think in 20 years governments as we know it will be changed dramatically.  But that all depends upon the citizens of those countries deciding when enough is enough.

Why I dont agree, we have cash in cashiers drawers, you don't have to put all your bitcoin in wallets everyone can access. The majority would Be in multi-signature cold wallets.
Why I dont think it will take over all fiat is because I dont think people will like the idea of being paid in a deflationary currency.  No more pay raises, it will be yearly cost of living adjustments that will make you make less btc next year than this year.  Psychologically people will outcry not understanding that they may actually be make "more" just the absolute numbers will look less.
I see btc as more of what every currency will be evaluated to. International settlements and wire transfers will be done in btc.

I agree, bitcoin could be banned by certain governments.  But most western governments would probably get that law repeal due to human rights issues (at least I hope it would).  The technical aspects of banning it would be enormous to do and cost billions of dollars and for what? what would they have to gain?  
Now to "take" over the network, a single government would need to build millions of miners without anyone knowing about it.  This would probably cost in the 100's of billions of dollars and the result would be fucking over its own citizens.  If they were unsuccessful in covertly getting that mining power (which would probably be the case) other people would most likely start to counter act with buying their own miners.  Hell even other governments may try to step in to prevent that country from doing that.

Yep just like they banned weed.  If there is a demand no laws will ever stop it.  One thing that will increase the demand is a person or group of people telling you that you cant use something just because they want to spy on you.  Bitcoin does no harm and for a government to ban it would more than likely increase its value or even worse potentially cause possible rioting/war.  With the rioting or war might not be likely it could be one of the things that breaks the camel's back.

I maybe wrong but here is what I believe when you establish a LN channel.
The funds are put into hold in a multisignature wallet where you and the recipient hold the key to transfer value on chain.  This multi-signature is only valid for X days, then the transaction to close the channel can be issued.
So you don't actually have the funds in your wallet to send.  Therefore, it will be an invalid transaction.

BCH price drop in 1 Day 6 Hours (
The retarget will die off...  Currently BCH is 6% more profitable then BTC (  In 1 Day and 6 Hours, BCH will get a 250% difficulty increase...  Even with EDA it shouldn't exceed the profitability by much...  This will cause the price to drop from investors and price of BTC to climb and eventually killing off any BCH ever having profitability &gt; than BTC.

They are the market maker.  
When the price gets higher than the current exchange rate, they will buy from exchange and sell to the futures contract making money on the difference.
When the price is too low, they will buy from the contracts and sell on the exchange.

There is 1 method that exchanges can do to verify deposit addresses.  
1. Exchanges publish a public key (can be bitcoin address) that they will use to sign messages.
2. Sign the deposit address
3. Present signature and deposit address to you.
4. You verify the signature using deposit address.
5. If it verifies, you can be pretty certain that they created that deposit address.

Yea, i have not seen it either.  It should be pretty simple to implement.  I am sure they have a secure server generating these deposit addresses, all it has to do is respond with a signature and the deposit address vs just the deposit address.

This will ultimately break BCH.   No one is going be taken advantage of..  They maybe able to do this a couple times, but miners will catch on and do the same thing.  You will have long periods every 2 weeks of no transactions and will break BCH.
Edit: Actually it will be different periods.. i.e. like 3 days of 2016 transactions, then 1 month of 2016 transactions.

I was thinking of an anonymous automated bitcoin escrow with user ratings (using wallet address)..  The site's login would use your private key by signing random string of messages and verifying that signature to log you in.  Here it would be similar to paypal, where you can create "Pay with BTC Escrow".  All of the data will be encrypted on your end with a passphrase used to decrypt it.  The site would only store encrypted data (so I wouldn't know anyone's info or transaction info). 
Buyer would send to a BTC address I created, then the seller would deliver item.  When delivered, buyer would need to within 10 days, confirm or reject payment to seller.  After 10 days, seller gets paid.  If rejected, then I would require proof of delivery of item.
Basically Anonymous Encrypted Paypal with Seller/Buyer ratings....

Funny thing is... miners won't switch all like that... it has to be more profitable... more miners that move to BCH less profitable it becomes (unless the price goes up).  More miners means difficulty will go up, also it means they miners are competing with each other (even if difficulty is low).  It balances...  Total network hashrate will be the % BCH price compared to BTC..  
Edit: At the current price, you should see BCH ~ 20% of BTC's hashrate. 
Edit 2: If the hashrate is lower than ~20% right now, then it's more profitable to mine BCH...  coindance's numbers are wrong because they don't track current network hashrate... only price vs difficulty.

They don't have to hold any crypto at all.   They can just sell fake bitcoin.  Since you can't deposit or withdrawal, that is all they are doing.  You can only withdraw fiat.  So you will have to sell that fake bitcoin to someone else then take their money and leave.

The price of real estate won't really go down in price, at least in the long run, it will fall in value when compared to purchasing power though.  
All of this isn't bubbles, it's just inflation.  It's just that the money from QE went to wall street and they spent it on more stock, causing an artificial rise in the stock prices.  The real inflation has not hit main street yet.  Once it does, real estate will explode in value compared to the $.  Now compared to purchasing power, it will be lower.  Bitcoin will go up in $ value and in real value (purchasing power).

You shouldn't use the same password on different websites.  Look into a password manager.The 2FA is a good thing though!
Your credentials were probably taken from some other compromised website which is the same as the one you are using for Binance.  They take that password to make it look "legitimate" and you think it's actually from them.
Edit:  
Passwords are suppose to be hashed (which means you can't extract the password from clear text that it shows).  Look up MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.  It's a one way function, you input data and it outputs a fixed length string.  Every time you input the exact same data, the same fixed length string comes out.  The only way to figure out what the input is in a hash function is to randomly keep trying inputs and see if the output is correct.  I would be willing to bet Binance is using some kind of hash function, hopefully a salted hash, to store passwords.  This means that Binance can not see what your password is, only the hash.  When you submit a password to them, they hash it and see if it matches their stored hash.

1.  You borrow someone else's bitcoin and then sell it
2.  The exchange loans you imaginary bitcoin that you can sell.
In both events, to make money you have to close your position, which means buying it back.  These shorts would just be temporarily bringing the market down, because you would then need to buy it all back.

Multi-signature allows this without a third party.  
For example:
Person A wants to send Person B 1btc in exchange for widget X.
Person A creates a multi-signature wallet with Person A's public key and person B's public key.
Person A then send's the fund to Multi-signature wallet.  This shows that Person A is good for the payment and it's locked in that wallet.
Person B will create a transaction from multi-sig wallet to Person B's personal wallet.  But this transaction will not take place until Person A signs it too.
Person B will then ship the Widget X to Person A.
Once Person A gets the Widget, he will then sign the transaction making it valid and it will be propagated to the Person B's personal wallet.
[Edit below]
Here is the code to create a multi-sig wallet:
bitcoind addmultisigaddress &lt;number of required signatures (2, 3, 4, ...)&gt; '["&lt;Person A Public Key&gt;","&lt;Person B Public Key&gt;","&lt;Person n Public Key&gt;", ...]'

The seed is used to generate 2^256 private keys (i.e. every possible private key ever to exist).  It basically is the seed to an algorithm to determine all your keys.
So a bitcoin private key is 00000... (256 0's) all the way to 1111... (256 1's)..  
ELI12: the algorithm takes your seed and adds a 1 to it to generate your first private key.  Then it takes your seed and adds a 2 to generate your second private key.  So forth and so on.   Since this is deterministic every time you put your seed plus 1 you will always get your first private key.  If you add 10 you will always get your 10th private key.
So you really cant get your private key as there is most likely 10's to 100's of them depending on which key you used.  There could technically be millions of them, but not likely.
Additionally, your seed is 2048^12 or 2048^24 possible combinations.

I am highly skeptical of their practice.  Based upon their model of no deposits or withdrawls of crypto, there is no guarantee they are actually selling real BTC or crypto.  They can easily just "print" BTC.  Since you can only buy it or sell it to other on their platform, no one would ever know.  It will be it's own marketplace.  
(edit) example of how this works:
1. Robinhood creates 100,000 Fake BTC... 
2. They set the sell price 0-2% above average market value across exchanges
3. People buy their Fake BTC...
4. Price increases 50%
5. Robinhood will never buy it, so you have to sell it to others within their ecosystem.
6. No BTC is ever actually bough or sold, it's extreme fractional reserve banking.
If they want me to believe, they need to release their wallet address with signature.  If they are using another exchange to sell to people, they need to release who their partner is.

You should really get off this buying a rig idea.  You will not make more BTC off the rig than just buying the BTC straight out.  If you spent 0.2 BTC on a rig, it will generate 0.15 BTC...  Do it in terms of BTC not fiat, that will tell you what is a better investment.

I doubt it..  This just makes less holders..  Which means less demand and increased supply.   Since no one is actually buying any assets, it's hurts.
Think of it like this:
There are 1000 widgets, and people want 2000 widgets...  The price should sky rocket right?   
Well what if someone says you can buy a widget from me, but you can't touch it because it doesn't exist.  Now there is unlimited widgets, you can buy it from someone who doesn't own it.  
That is basically what is happening.  They are matching buyers with short sellers, and short sellers with buyers.  None of these people actually own the widget.   Now if you force people to actually borrow someone else's widget to short it and people had to actually buy a tangible (i know it's digit, but blockchain makes digital items tangible) item then price will go higher.

To truly understand all of this you need to understand SHA256.  SHA256 is a one way checksum/hash algorithm.  A hash/checksum algorithm is primarily used to check the integrity of data.  As in the data has not changed.  If you input BlueRedBlack into a SHA256 function you will get "c7a6136f178840d6809495af174add493499c17c554e237ff339547a45a9f4d0" everytime.  If you enter TheBigRedDog into a SHA256 function you will get "dfef6e34ad573c7d0ec305406325bc4639f5baf5e202fa611e96ea239cc72e46" everytime.
So now that we understand more of what a SHA256 function does, it is important to note that this is what a bitcoin private key is.  The result of a SHA256 function, which is also a string of 256 1's and 0's.
*note the below is an example, not exactly how the BIP39 protocol works, but used for illustrative purposes*
So BIP39 uses a predefined set of 2048 words.  The first 4 characters of each word is unique.  This is to say that no other word in that list contains the exact same 4 beginning characters in that order.  So to *deterministically* generate a private key, it uses the first 4 characters of each word in the order given and strings them together.  Then it will append a 1 to the end of it.  Then it will hash those.
Let's use TheBigRedDog as an example seed.  So we will hash TheBigRedDog1 to get the first private key. To get the second private key we will hash TheBigRedDog2.  The third TheBigRedDog3.  Those will generate the following:
No matter how many times you put in those inputs, you will get the same output.
In essence this is what BIP39 is doing.  Your seed + sequence number into a SHA256 function to get a new private key.  So as long as you have the seed, you can always get the private key using the same formula.
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:13:29
Theoretically, all BIP39 seeds have everyone's private keys.  If you generate new addresses with it enough you will eventually get everyone's private key.  The security here is there is 2^256 possible keys, which makes it practically impossible.
You recover your private keys by importing your seed into a BIP39 wallet which will generate the deterministic private keys for you.

I hope that's sarcastic.  We will need to increase the block size eventually.  But it's best to wait for technology to catch up in terms of network/bandwidth speed and storage costs.  
The real risk in increasing the block size is that it increases the cost for everyone to own a node, also the time it takes for blocks tonpropogate takes longer.  This makes the person who found the last block have a headstart on looking for the next block because you increased the time it took for other systems to recognize a the block was found and now it has to start over and look for a new block.  All this while the miner who found the previous block has been mining the newest block for 30s or more.

A wallet can be thought of one or multiple private keys.
Or is can be thought of a single private key.
BIP39 which implemented the Seed words helps with this problem by making the private keys able to be generated deterministically. So wallets that implement BIP39 would be a wallet that contains multiple keys as they are generated in a pre-determined way.

We should build a mesh wifi network somehow.  When i say mesh wifi network, every one's wifi connected to everyone else's in an open wifi relay.  This is open and segregated from your internal home network.  Using new routing protocols, we can find the shorted path out to the internet.  
Imagine if everyone had a wifi router that connected to everyone else's?  It would be one large internet network that anyone can access anywhere.
Maybe we can build a block chain to incentivize people to share their internet?  Maybe somehow rewards for most data throughput?

Not sure what you dont understand.  They can use BTCPay and integrate BTCPay with an exchange of their choosing.  Or even build their own payment gateway that integrates with the exchange of their choosing.
I am not saying anywhere BTCPay is linked automatically with some exchange.
Edit:  maybe I need to clarify more.  Namecheap can use BTCPay and use what ever exchange Namecheap wants to use.  I know BTCPay is not part of any exchange.
I have no idea how you are reading into this differently.  Namecheap can choose to do business with coinbase. Then install a BTCPay server to accept payments, then automatically after payment send btc it to coinbase to be sold.

I am pretty sure most people dont want to be paid in a deflationary currency.

Loans will still be possible, because trade will still be thing.  Let's say you make 2 BTC/month from your job.  And you borrow 10BTC @ 5%. You took the 10BTC loan to buy a car.  That 10 BTC goes from loan originator to you to the dealership.  This doesn't mean 30 BTC is needed, it still only needs 10.  As you make money, you can pay the .1BTC/month back to the loan originator.  Eventually paying the 10 BTC plus the interest.  That 10 BTC you spent on the car will circulate through the economy changing hands as work is performed between individuals/companies.

In a bitcoin dominated world, interest rates would probably be really low for collateralized loans.  Bitcoin is deflationary, that means one bitcoin today is worth less than 1 bitcoin tomorrow.  You will basically earn interest (by deflation, increased purchasing power) by holding the bitcoin.  This negates the need to invest to get higher returns.
You would likely seen 0.05% interest rates on home loans.  But you will also see home loans being much shorter terms...
It's deflationary because of a fixed supply but increasing population and demand for it.

You would see loans..  Most likely being really low interest rates (for prime borrowers)....  Because it's deflationary, it gains interest on its own (if it was a major currency).  This is because there are people born every day and that increased the demand for the common medium of exchange.  
For auto loans, maybe 0.25% interest, home loans maybe 0.05%...  Again, for prime borrowers...  Where you would see high interest rates (talking 10%) would be on non-collateral loans, like personal loans and credit cards (would this be a thing?)...

Eventually the barrier to entry will be high to get people in invest or create the next "new" thing.  Bitcoin will just take everyone else's idea and implement it..  Bitcoin will have smart contracts in the future too, and probably better.
I don't think 10% is unreasonable valuation given the tech and it's utility.  If we do all printed currency, it's probably like 1% to reach $18k.

Simple math is what causes terabyte blocks that take longer than 10 minutes to confirm, ultimately ruining the network.
This is why off chain solutions are the better engineering answer.
You can't just keep increasing block size.  Literally helping centralized mining even more.  Every miner would have to connect to a single node to get the next block as fast as possible.  Then that single node would have so much control.  
If 1mb blocks take 5 seconds to transfer across 10 nodes to reach the other miners, 8mb will take 40 seconds.  16mb will take 80 seconds...  etc. Etc.

I am NO2X, but core could just rebase on the BTC1 fork, and then continue working off 2X if this happens.. No one gets "fired".  If there is consensus, i.e. 90%+ hashrate and the investors choose 2x, i.e. higher value...  It is officially the BTC chain.  the pre-2x chain is then the altcoin.
The problem here is that S2X is being "forced" on users by offering no replay protection.  Basically it becomes a shit-show and we will have to be careful with how we transfer out coins between the two chains so it isn't replayed on both chains.  i.e. if you send BTC to an exchange, you could send both pre and post s2x fork to that address.

Alot of work he is doing against overwhelming consensus from the bitcoin investors.   I think most of the investors are not interested in S2X.
Possibly the only ones that are interested are miners, to increase the number of transactions they can charge fees for.  But in my experience as a ex-miner, I would mine what ever was most profitable, and as we can see in BCH, the miners move with the money.  Most *large* miners have loans, electricity costs, employees they have to pay, and most people get into mining at least on a large scale to make a profit.

The number 42 is, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years. Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is. Thus, to calculate the Ultimate Question, a special computer the size of a small planet was built from organic components and named "Earth". The Ultimate Question "What do you get when you multiply six by nine"[17] was found by Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect in the second book of the series, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. This appeared first in the radio play and later in the novelization of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The fact that Adams named the episodes of the radio play "fits", the same archaic title for a chapter or section used by Lewis Carroll in "The Hunting of the Snark", suggests that Adams was influenced by Carroll's fascination with and frequent use of the number. The fourth book in the series, the novel So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, contains 42 chapters. According to the novel Mostly Harmless, 42 is the street address of Stavromula Beta. In 1994 Adams created the 42 Puzzle, a game based on the number 42.

I can't pay for physical security my self?  I mean, if I didn't have to pay for police, i am sure i would get better quality protection by hiring my own security company.
I am also not saying that the government should not exists (part of me wants it not to, but I am on the fence on certain things).  But there are methods to get revenue without forcing people.  The government should be forced to compete without having to resort to stealing money.
You don't pay for fire insurance... Your house burns.
You don't pay for security, you can take the risk of being hurt.

Roads give a very good example.  If roads were privatized, highways would have a lot less traffic for two reasons: 1 reduced demand due to (fallacies of the common) and 2, if there was a traffic stand still, they would invest in more roads to get more people down that road to collect more tolls.

Thats because there is a double standard in the US.  The USD is the US'  export.  Since it's a reserve currency, other countries want to buy it and buy our bonds.  This way we don't need the fed to buy it by printing.  But this only goes so far, there is only so much wanting to be bought.  
The US runs almost a $1T deficit every year.  With the UBI plan here of $1000/month we are going to run a $4T deficit.  There isn't enough people willing to buy that every year.
This will significantly increase the money supply way more than 6%.

So I did a calculation on UBI.
US Gov bring in $3.3T in tax revenue
It spend $802B on Social Security or 24%.
It spends $300B on other "Safety Net" programs or 9%.
UBI is suppose to get rid of Social Security and "Safety Net" Programs.
UBI is estimated to cost between 10-15% of GDP.  Calculating 12% of GDP it will cost $2.2T. There are 330 Million people in the US. This means a UBI payment of $6800 per person.
UBI cost = $2.2T
Social Security + Safety Nets = $1.1T
So it cost twice as much to have UBI and still have less $ for the people who need it.

That is true because copper is actually being bought and there is only one method to buy it, via copper futures!
They have exchanges for bitcoin where you can actually get bitcoin, where is that for copper?  With bitcoin futures no one is getting any bitcoin, so there is unlimited bitcoin futures. I can buy 42M bitcoins in futures (If there was liquidity), they can never deliver that. With copper someone has to actually own that copper to make a contract with you and deliver it to you.
Also, the price of copper pipes do not affect the price of copper.  The price of copper affects the price of copper pipes.  One is dependant upon the other to be made.  Also, bad analogy..  Copper Futures are settled in copper.  Copper pipes when sold, will be settled in copper.  Thus affecting the supply of copper.

Understood, but nodes are not going to reject a block until it doesn't meet protocol.  I.e. a too big block.   As long as S2X keeps within the protocol (not building too big of a block) it will still be accepted.  After the first one is rejected by the nodes, then every block after that one will be rejected.

It is factually inaccurate.  You don't create new money by loaning out money.  When someone loans money to someone, they spend it (why else borrow the money and pay interest?).  That money then goes into someone else's hands, there is still the same amount of money.  Then those people spend their money, which then goes to someone else's hands, and so forth.  You speak on this with your Velocity of money.
The money is not paid back all at once (because no one actually has the money to pay it all back at once or else they wouldn't need a loan).  So people pay it back over years.  Loans can always be made, you don't need an influx of new cash into a system to keep up loans.  Anyhow, people have to have the cash to loan out.  If you loan out all your cash, you can't loan out any more.  If this is what you are speaking of, that is not a problem.  This would just increase the value of the bitcoin (this is why it's deflationary).  The less availability of something the higher the value.
You are thinking of loans in a inflationary currency terms.  In deflationary currency, loans will be made near 0% interest.  Because they will make most of their value by holding it, the extra 0.5% interest comes out to a lot more than in inflationary currencies.  Additionally, people will get paid less every year rather than pay raises every year.  You will still have the same or more buying power, but less units coming in.  This will make you need less and less of a loan to buy car, or a house, or whatever.  So today you may need .25 BTC for a house, in 30 years you may only need .1 BTC for the same house.

ETF actually reduces the bitcoin supply unlike the futures which is cash settled.  No one actually is buying any bitcoin at all, just betting on the price of it.  
ETF's actually matter to bitcoin demand.  You can't increase the demand if no one is actually going to buy it.  Again, futures are settled in cash not in the actual currency.  There is demand for a bet, not actual bitcoin.

That's what voluntary charities are for.  You're description of a shark pool is hyperbole.  With none to minimal taxes, everyone would be able to support themselves.  Prices would come down significantly where people will be able to support themselves.  
1. Healthcare will be cheaper because you won't have the government artificially inflating the true value (regulations, patents, etc). 
2. What about children?  That is someones decision, they have to live with what ever outcomes from that.
3. Disabled is your best example, but just like people give charity today, without taxes there will be tons more.
In a deflationary currency, prices would get cheaper and cheaper because the value goes higher and higher as there is more demand and fixed supply (or reduced supply).
The amount most people will make when they are 20 will be higher than the amount most people make at 50 because you will get "pay reductions" every year because prices go lower and the currency increases in value.  That is not to say your purchasing power per year will go lower, that will probably go higher.

I think 20% of the "Investors" not necessarily miners may prefer S2X..  80% do not agree with it..
Problem here is they want to move BTC to S2X with no replay protection.  They are calling it an "upgrade".  
They are attempting to force it on people who do not want it.  If S2X was an upgrade and had consensus, they could just simply enable some replay protection and everyone would move over there, no big deal. Consensus is about the rules of the protocol.  Nodes choose the rules of the protocol, miners follow it, otherwise it's on a different chain.
Maybe 90% of the miners do want S2X.  But that does not meet consensus for BTC, only S2X.  They could fork and have S2X if they want, but they should try not to force it upon people who don't want it.  It is literally an attack.  
If the market speaks and decides they want to have S2X more valuable than BTC and it has majority hash rate, I think it's no problem having S2X take BTC's name. The issue here is how they are going about the implementation.

Dude, automation isn't a job killer.  Sure it will kill some jobs.  But for every advancement it creates a whole new sector of jobs.  
This has been true with every innovation that has came out.  If automation kills jobs, then no one has money to buy the stuff to pay for the robots. Which then makes the robots obsolete because they can't turn a profit.  This won't happen.  The natural forces will keep most automation too costly.  If they have robots doing everything, electricity will cost more to run the bots than having a human do it.  It will all work it's self out.  You can't displace 40% of a work force and expect for companies to make money, most "serious" automation will alway cost more than human labor.  That mean doing more than menial tasks that are repetitive.  Things that requires someone to think.  You have to program that in there and test it, then test it more, then test it more.  You will need some serious AI that is not discovered to go past this robot puts a door on a car.  This robot stacks boxes.  All of that AI cost development time, testing time, etc..  To automate large physical processes it cost a tremendous amount of money.  And not 1 business does it the same way as all other businesses.  Hell most business change their process every 2-3 months.

What are you talking about.  Making a loan doesn't create more of something that doesn't exists.  
Loan = Trading future earnings for something today.
Lets say there is 100 bitcoins ever.  I take a loan for 5 bitcoins, but get paid 2 bitcoin a month. Lets say I have to pay 6 bitcoins back in 6 months.  I can earn the 12 bitcoins in that 6 months.  There isn't not 118 bitcoins, there is still 100 bitcoins.  I just traded my time for someone else's bitcoins. 
Saying making a loan increases the supply artificially is FACTUALLY INACCURATE. What you are basically saying is people can't earn more money unless more money is printed.
I can even have 500 bitcoins in loans. with only 100 bitcoin supply.  If i make 10 bitcoins a month and loan out all 10 with interest, people can still pay the .1 bitcoin payment.  If I keep this up long enough, there will be more than 100 bitcoins.  It will all resolve itself.  Because I will have to loan it to others who will then spend it for more jobs and what nots..
Only way this would break is if a few people had like 99.9% of all bitcoins and just horde them.  Then it would break.

I wouldn't say in rare cases.  Most people don't start their own business for two main reasons:
1. The business they *want* to start they don't have the capital.
I say *want* because people want to make a ton more.  It doesn't cost a lot to start a lawn mowing business.  Or pool cleaning business.  Or X, Y, Z business.  It's just that people don't *want* to start those kinds of businesses.
2. People are content not taking the risk and working for someone.
Risk/Reward is more than just investing in stocks, bond, crypto.  It's in life also.  You can take a risk to go to school in hopes that you can find a better job than without education.  If you take higher risk, it's because they are comfortable with it for the chances of a higher reward.

People were scared of cars taking horse and buggy jobs.  People were scare of the internet getting rid of telephone companies.  Dude, every innovation comes with it a whole new set of other jobs. Why is this any different?  Who is going to refuel them?  Maintain them?  Run their networks?  Tell them what to do? Program them to do new jobs? And 100 other unknown other jobs that have not been though of yet because they are not in existence.
I think most doctors do it because they want to help people and they like the career field.  But how many people would become a doctor if they got the same life as someone who didn't invest 10 years of school.  It would be easier to become a doctor, but you would have a hell of a lot less people doing it.  The time investment is horrible to make.
I am sure a lot of people in the world.  That isn't despite government, it's because of government.  Why is the US different than India?  Why is Kazakhstan different than Germany?

You realize 2x adds to more centralization by increasing xfer time of blocks.  Miners will collude and have dedicated nodes to them selves to increase their chance of hashing by reducing the speed this node will relay to those not in the pool.  They will out hash any other node and orphan them causing miners not in this "cartel" to be allowed to gain any blocks by outweighing their transactions.

2.  People suggest Dollar Cost Averaging(DCA).  I would only do this if you have a set goal in mind.  Like, i won't sell it for at least 5 years.

3. With exchanges you are subject to counter-party risk.  If the exchange goes bankrupt, hacked, or steals your coins.  You have limited remedies to get those coins back. Look into Mt.Gox.

Do you really think we will be able to build sentient AI?  Thats what you need to take 40% of jobs.  We literally have to build humans from machinery.  Look at how much people hate automated phone services.
For every job lost from most technological advancements, there is at least 2 created.  Computers and the internet is pretty much getting rid of bank tellers, and yet there are 1000's of jobs in IT and there are still bank tellers.
Automations only work for tasks that require 0 logical reasoning.  I.e. very specific tasks that are repetitive.  Unless they can create sentient AI, it's not going to automate every job away.  It will create new ones.
Someone has to check the status of the robots.  Someone has to change their fluids.  Someone has to monitor the process to make sure they are not malfunctioning. Someone has to clean the robots.  Someone has to reprogram them for new tasks.

What he says is true.  But an ETF is a "fund" that is managed by a company.  A Bitcoin ETF is a fund that buys bitcoin and manages bitcoin for you.
Why most people are excited it because it allows "institutional investors", i.e. people will millions and billions of dollars to invest to finally buy bitcoin in a regulated way.
Following economic's basic principle of supply and demand.  The more demand for a product while the supply stays the same, the price increases.
People are expecting the ETF to get approved and these funds to get investors to put small percentage of their money into bitcoin which should make the price of bitcoin rise.

You are under the assumption that there are people are in poverty because of capitalism. The truth is people are in poverty because of too much government.  
I am on the fence between no government and very little government.  Definitely know that more government is bad and never solves a problem.  Look at the US' war on drugs, war on poverty.  None of these have done anything to help either drugs or poverty, that's because you can't tax your way into prosperity.

You can't tax a country into prosperity, just doesn't happen.  Throughout the US History since the advent of the Fed Income Tax, there have been high taxes, low taxes..  The Fed Gov always brought in nearly 17% of GDP...  So it's not how much you tax, you won't get more than 17% +/- 2% of GDP..  Taxing more will just reduce GDP and the government will have less revenue....

The next speaker (Dr. Garrett) does make a good point.  Cash will eventually be obsolete.  Be it Government issued digital cash (not necessarily crypto), or Decentralized Crypto Currency.
Eventually companies and banks will refuse to accept hard cash which will eventually force the government to remove physical money (cost to make physical cash will outweigh the need and remove it's actual use since banks won't accept).  
This is actually really long term bullish on cryptocurrency.  Just need to scale bitcoin to eventually be able to take it's place when this happens rather than some other crypto.
We still probably have 10+ years before this (unless fiat actually goes to crap before then).

If BTC drops 20% and i get 1.2 BTC's for every BTC I could have bought... 
If BCC is only 10% the cost of BTC at the time i sell, then yes, I lose 10% opportunity cost.
If BTC only drops 10% and BCC is 12% of the BTC price, I gain 2% vs selling...

To figure out the hashrate of BCC it's a simple formula:
* BTC_Price = BTC's price
* BCC_Price = BCC's Price
* BCC_Hashrate = BCC's Hashrate as a percentage of BTC's Hashrate (+/- 2%)
    BCC_Hashrate = ( BCC_Price / BTC_Price ) * 100

Its like congress with republicans and democrats...  They both want the country to do better, just in different manners...
Here in BTC Land, we have users (vote with fiat) and miners (vote with hash)..  Miners will lose fiat (to pay for electricity and hardware) if there are no users to buy their coins.  Users need miners to process transactions and protect the network..
This is normal.

Bitcoin going from $2500 to $2000 is a 25% loss..
ETH going from $200 to $150 is a 25% loss...  
Notice how the %'s are the same but the $ amounts are different?  The actual price of each coin does not matter...  its the % that it moves...
By your logic you are saying its better for BTC to go from $2500 to $3500 than ETH going from $200 to $400...  because "$1000" is larger than "$200"...  
The problem here is that my $10000 increased on BTC by $4000, while on ETH the same $10000 increase by $10000

A fork is when they create two seperate block chains, in essence two different coins.   
An example of what happened on another cryptocurrency that split was Ethereum.  There was a block split and out came ETH (The changed and longest block) and ETC (Ethereum Classic).  
When the split happened, the amount you have in your wallet was the same amount on both chains.  Places like coinbase never returned the Ethereum Classic to the users (from what I remember).   So it's best to have the crypto in your own private wallet.

I feel different about this... Many people are smarter now a days...  Most people probably want to buy some to get the free BCC that's coming their way..   I am kind of relating this to the ETH fork..  It went up right before the fork..  Then dropped 50% like a day or two before.  then went back up like 30-40% the day after, then leveled out for a year...  Also, ETC has increased in price, so holding those BCCs could actually bring you some good money on top of what BTC gains over the next year.

Don't mine.. use that money to buy bitcoin instead..  Then use the money you would spend on electricity to buy bitcoin instead.
You will end up with more bitcoins that the miner will ever produce.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:19:39
For instance...  Lets say you have 1 BTC...  and you trade 10x on margin...  that allows you to buy/sell 10BTCs with the 1 BTC you own.
Hypothetically, lets say you leverage the 10x with your 1 BTC @ $2500 by going long.
If the price drops to $2250, they will margin call and you will have 0 BTCs now (i.e. lose everything).
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:28:04
Explain?  
BIP91 lock in (unless a majority of miners change their word) will mandate that after the next 336 blocks they will start rejecting blocks that are not compatible with BIP141.  This will cause BIP141 to reach it's 95% requirement and activate segwit.

@_date: 2017-07-29 00:23:01
So lets put it this way...  
* 1H/sec = 1 guess a second
* 10 x people @ 1H/sec = 10H/sec
If you were to start guessing 1H/Sec with 10 other people, your chance of guessing the number is 1 in 11.
Lets add 100 more people guessing @ 1H/Sec...  Now your chance of guessing the number is 1 in 111...

Remember "The Flippening" ?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:15:40
Looks like BIP91 will be locked in in a few hours...  When this happens, it will  then be another 336 blocks before non-BIP141 blocks are rejected.  These block rejections will activate Segwit when it reaches 95% over a certain period because 100% of blocks will be BIP141 compatible.
When UASF activates Aug 1st, if BIP91 is already rejecting, UASF will do nothing because there will be no blocks to reject since they are all BIP141 compatible.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:48:58
How is it going to be anything like fiat?  The reason fiat is called fiat is because they can add more supply at any time.  With Segwit, we still only will ever have 21M coins.

Just saying the value of something is based on supply and demand. Just because supply increased doesnt automatically mean the value decreases. As long as the demand increases proportionally to the supply increase, the value should stay steady.

When a chain forks... the keys are the same on both sides... If you transact on one side, they can take that same code and "replay" it on the other side..  Effectively it moves the coins on both chains.

If you use a hash function, there is no way to reverse it.  The purpose of a hash is to verify integrity, not encrypt data.  It is a fixed size length string.  The inputs could be of any size, no way in reversing that.

Sell 80% and keep 20% then....

I think you will still see fighting, but ultimately you will probably see the majority of the miners want 2x (like 60-70% hashrate)..  What will happen is the other 30-40% will not want to split the chain and will compromise on the 2x....

Basically as long as they are about 8-9% of the hasrate of BTC currently... their difficulty wont adjust until blocks are over 2 hours long.  At below like 8.5% theyr blocks will be longer than 2 hours (2 x 6 = 12hr) and the MTP will then start to adjust down 20% for each MTP above 12hrs.

Three options:
First: $50 could go down to $25 (probably more like $30-$40).... but if it does, it will probably go back up to $50 shortly...  If you do this, you get some free BCC's (Same ammount you have in BCC) assuming you have the private keys to the wallet.  This free BCC, no one knows what the price will be, but it could be like a free $5-$20 for you.
Second: Sell $50, and buy back at a lower price and then after recovery, your $50 will be like $60-$70...
Third option (alot less likely),
BTC doesn't drop, and if you held you still get the free BCCs
But in a couple weeks after, I think price will be back as it is today (or higher)

but in the history of bitcoin... it has always gone up...
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:19:46
So in order to get a jump on every other pool.. many pools will hold back their sending that they found a block by a few seconds.  This will allow the miners a head start in mining the next block.
Since they found a block so soon, they released it with no transactions so it would propagate faster across network and claim their reward..  Then they released the second block after that with transactions.

Sure you can in most instances.  Now you won't be at the bottom, but somewhere near the bottom.  Just look at moving averages, outstanding orders, where price is relative the the moving average lines.
Edit: The idea to to follow the waves =P...  You don't have the buy the absolute lowest cost, same with selling, you don't have to sell the absolute highest price..  Just that your sells are higher than your buys.
I wouldn't do this on a daily basis, but on a larger time frame it works.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:01:11
How? You get segwit first, and then maybe if we get hash rate support 2mb blocks? It's a compromise from the miners to allow segwit

Gamblers Fallacy:
"The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature). In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i.e., independent trials of a random process), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false. This fallacy can arise in many practical situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where such mistakes are common among players."

The private key signs the transaction making it impossible to change.  You can use the public key to verify the signature, but not change it.

You have the option, spend $12500 on mining equipment and take the risk to possibly make more than 2 bitcoins.  Just guessing didn't do the math today, but you could possibly end up with like 12.25 BTC if everything stayed constant.  Or you could by 2 bitcoins for that $12,500 and have a guranteed 2 bitcoins.
You have to consider: Monthly payment on electricity, having a heater running in your house 24/7 (these miners are basically heaters), the change in difficulty over time.
If you buy a miner cloud or in home, you are taking a chance.  You will probably end up with anywhere between 0.9 - 1.1 bitcoins for each bitcoin you spend.  Is that really worth the hassle?
Take into account the opportunity cost of just buying the bitcoin vs risk of getting less bitcoin than you could have done just by buying it at the current price.

So income is not increasing to meet basic living standards.  There are alot of factors here supply and demand being a big one.  But monetary supply being increased 5%/yr does play a contributing factor in this.
Also saying it is beginning to show the signs of a hyper inflation. Not saying its here or cant be fixed, but definately the symptoms are showing up.
Additionally, look at the huge movement behind many socialist policies, the idea behind modern monetary theory taking root, the demands for people to pay more than 35% of their income to give to others, the rise in socialized medicine, etc.  The USA is definately moving closer to what caused problems in Venezuela.

I don't think it will happen....  Only reason for the UAHF was bitmain saying if UASF happens then he would HF...  Since UASF is a mute point since BIP91 is going to lock and hopefully miners are true to their word and it starts rejecting non Segwit blocks after the 336 grace period, then UASF doesn't do anything.

Coinbase has free trading if you do limit trades on their pro platform.  [
If you do a market buy (being a taker vs maker) you will pay a fee.  If you put a limit and someone takes your offer, they pay the fee and you pay nothing.

Miners are the ones who process transactions.  This happens about every 10 minutes.  Only one miner is the one who finds a block.  He is rewarded with the block reward and transaction fees.  He can process 1mb of transactions when he finds this block.
So in order for you to "process" transaction, your miner will need to find a block. Else the transaction goes to anothe r miner who found the block.

Security by obscurity provides no security.  You can generate software to look for Stego (especially if you know what software algorithm was used to make it) to find anything hidden in the images.  
Now if you encrypted the private key and then stego'd it, it would be better off.  But in that case there really is no reason to stego it.  You can transmit a 256 bit encryption in the clear with little worry that someone will be able to decrypt it.  You could then use stego to send the passphrase for the encrypted private bitcoin key or even better a seperate encrypted end-to-end communication channel.

I'll object to some of those assertion later in this comment, but for this first argument, i'll assume what you are saying is true.  That is just the nature of a decentralized platform where there are monetary incentives.  Of course people will want to control something that has value.  Doesn't make it centralized, it is by design decentralize, there are just some people who have invested more to gain higher market share of that decentralized platform.
Objection:  
Miners don't control Bitcoin, it's the users.  Without the users, they control nothing.  If the users don't like what they are doing, they just move to another or make their own.  Completely ruining the value they invested into that control.

Many exchanges allow you to create an API (Application Programming Interface) key where you can disable certain features like withdrawing funds. You can just enable buys/sells via this API key.
What you are probably doing is giving him this API key or he has made software you run and it's issuing commands for this software to connect to your exchange via API to perform the buys/sells.

If it's in LN it should be locked until you close your channel.  You can't trade them until you send them to an exchange.

When I say "float" i am speaking in terms of using other peoples coins to buy and sell.

Store of value is used to STORE VALUE.  Only in very few places are people actively looking to STORE VALUE for 12 months, 24 months, 36 months.  They are looking to STORE VALUE for years, in which case bitcoin has been very successful at.  
There really is only 3 places where you can STORE VALUE that isn't very dependant upon someone else's performance:

I disagree.  Investors that are selling will not just want to "sit" on cash.  Most of them will look for places to put that cash.

This is a little bit of a misnomer.  Sure M1 supply rises, but people are born every day.  It's all about supply AND DEMAND, not just supply.  You can increase supply as long as there is a higher demand for that it will maintain or increase in value. Imagine there is only 1,000,000 euros for 300,000,000 people.  It would be worth quite a lot, the same as if there was 2,000,000 euros for 600,000,000 people.  Supply was increased, but so was demand.

But if you are thinking of BitCoin Cash, then when a fork happens, the amount you have in BTC (in a private wallet) before the fork you will have in both chains after the fork.
i.e., buy 5 BTCs now before the fork.  After the fork, you will have 5 BTCs and 5 BCC (BitCoin Cash)

Didn't bitmain want to "get a head start" on Bitcoin ABC?
I assumed it was to reduce the difficulty once it's released.

1. You don't "have" to use the "Hubs"
2. There is going to be competition between "Hubs".
You're acting if centralization is bad period.  Doesn't matter in what aspect.  LN Hubs can't really do much but process transactions.  I guess they may be able (?) to deny certain transactions from happening?  But it's still a decentralized centralization.  There is more than 1 Hub that are run by different people.  People can create direct LN transactions between each other too, doesn't require a Hub.

There are only 2048 possible words.  It would be relatively simple (if you have coding experience) to get that last word.  You would need to program a script to brute force the last word.  So you try all combination of those 11 + 1 of these 2048 ( [  )
Writing a script should be able to do it within 1 hour.
