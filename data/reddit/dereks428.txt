It’ll go back down. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:19:49
Now the age-old question: where’s the dip? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:38:35
Anyone think we’ll see &lt;7,000 by tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:30:57
Ah, I see. Good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:29:51
I would love to see a slow bleed to 5k before a rebound 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:28:55
Haha I know I need to chill. I am familiar with GDAX And I have a limit order at 6000. I’m not sure it will actually reach that, but if it does I’ll be ready to buy.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:10:05
I don’t own any coin right now, but if it dips below 6500 I will buy some then, and keep buying small amounts at a time while the price is low. We may not see a big upward trend anytime soon, but there’s bound to be a huge one coming up in the next 2 to 3 years.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:37:39
Almost certainly not. There’s really no way to know how much lower it could go, though... at least if this isn’t the dip, you’d still be buying close to it. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:15:29
If you don’t believe in BTC long-term then why buy at all 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:39:58
I don’t think we’ve reached the dip yet. Even if it does go lower, you’re likely going to get a nice return over the next couple years.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:25:10
Definitely a trap. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a reciprocal drop through tonight and tomorrow
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:11:40
Remind me! 3 months
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:28:01
Every time we’re in the green people think we’re going to the moon. We’ll probably see a new monthly low tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:22:10
That would be excellent for those of us not HODL
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:45:42
Obviously to buy cheaper bitcoin. Your money is only evaporating if you sell at that price.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:35:05
Maybe it won’t be this year. Who cares? If you believe in BTC long-term (and I think most people here do), you should see that as an opportunity to buy more while it’s relatively cheap. 2-3 years from now this we are going to look like the people who bought in much earlier. I just wish I had more financial stability so I could buy more. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:13:27
Or an opportunity to buy more at a cheaper price 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:13:58
I don’t think we’ve seen the dip yet.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:33:55
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:20:29
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:43:47
Wait. It will go lower
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:26:06
I looked into Gemini but I think I’d rather use GDAX. That is a nice feature, though. I misunderstood before I added funds to my Coinbase account; I thought I could purchase BTC at its current price while the funds are transferred from my bank account. Not a big deal now that I know that 
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:19:41
6k here we come!
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:19:46
Why not buy on the dips and sell higher? It’s likely going to keep fluctuating like this before it gets anywhere near a new ATH. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:30:52
No way it doesn’t rebound before then. I don’t think it goes any lower than 5.8k before it goes back up for a little while. 4-5k definitely possible after that 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:32:05
Is 3500 that unrealistic?
Edit: I am very new to this. I admit my ignorance and would love to learn more. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:20:10
I would love to have .5 BTC
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:56:05
As someone currently not holding any BTC, the plummeting price is encouraging. I hope it continues to around 4500-5000. I will be keeping a very close eye on it. The problem is, how far up will the price have to go before I realize the dip is over? 
Edit: I think a sensible thing to do at this time is make lots of purchases (say, 10-20) over the next few weeks. You would have to pay transaction fees each time,  but it would ensure your cost average being closer to the bottom of the eventual dip. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:28:29
It’s a decentralized universal currency that is (or at least will be) highly secure and will allow for more financial freedom. Why have a bank hold your money for you when you can hold it all yourself? Why go through exchanging currencies when you can use a currency that is good anywhere AND can be converted to local currencies if desired. 
Is it necessary? No. But there are definite advantages to using it, and it is only in its infancy. Imagine the opportunities that we can’t even foresee right now. I think this questioning is like people wondering what the deal is with this whole internet thing back in the mid-late 90s. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:44:44
They haven’t gotten their Easter money yet silly 
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:12:45
It’s bias**ed**
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:05:33
I’m guessing we’ll be looking at 6500-7000 by the end of the month. The dip is not over 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:16:05
I have funds pending in my Coinbase account. I hope the price doesn’t shoot up before I get a chance to buy. Then again, I don’t know if I should wait longer to see if it goes down again. What to do, what to do...
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:42:55
Meaning it’s going to rise before it drops that low (if it does)? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:55:58
Any chance we hit 6k by this weekend?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:11:39
A $300 jump in the last hour. I think we’re still trending downward 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:00:25
Well, I was going to wait for 6k... now I’m thinking this is about as low as it’s going to go for now. I’m debating whether to wait or buy now and sell when I can get a 10-15% profit and try to buy lower later. Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:57:50
I appreciate the honesty. I, for one, believe it is going to skyrocket over the next 2-3 years, and I want to get in as low as possible before it does. 
Of course, I would never invest (gamble) more than I can afford to lose, especially on something so speculative. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:14:55
Over/under 6k before a rebound? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:20:57
I see. Thank you for the insight. Maybe I should keep an eye on the $6,000-6,500 range, then?
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:58:45
I’m buying as much as possible if we see it dip to 5k. I think it’s going to take another few months before we see the true dip though. Once it starts going up again, it could totally skyrocket. I plan to buy consistently over the next few months and hold for a couple years. Could be looking very good financially by the time I finish medical school (5 years from now). It’s pretty exciting to think about!
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:54:28
No need to eat that loss. Just buy more when it’s cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:06:58
Why do people get so excited every time the price rises for an hour 
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:13:18
I think I’m going to wait. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:23:03
I’m resisting the temptation to buy. We are still trending down hard and I think I can buy lower. Anyone with me? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:50:21
I have my limit order set at 6k. I will buy as much as possible if it continues to drop below that. Maybe I should lower my limit order to 5-5.5k? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:31:13
As someone who missed the “dip”... I hope so. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:21:36
Imagine what bitcoin could be in 10 years when it’s used as commonly as debit cards are now. People who invest now are going to look like those who invested in Apple in the 80s. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:02:08
I will be patiently waiting until it hits 6k to buy. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:00:14
How low will we see it go by this weekend? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:44:52
Well, I can’t be. I think the deflating price will keep people panic selling/ not buying for a while longer. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:05:15
It’s way too early to say that 
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:41:19
Again, new technology will make it even more secure. How is having a secure wallet (or wallets) containing money only you can access worse than having money in a bank insured by the FDIC?
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:12:26
That’s exactly it— once this new dual layer lightning technology is widespread (and it will be eventually), the fluctuation, fees, and slow transactions won’t be a problem. BTC is here to stay, and I for one want to get in before it starts skyrocketing upward in a few years. 
It is a long term investment, but the more risk you take in investing early on, the higher the reward. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:59:19
Goodness. Lots of negative people here today. I’m ready to buy at a discount! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:17:04
Loving this downward trend. Hopefully it continues for a few weeks/months. I may be overly optimistic, but I think the dip is going to be at about $3,500. If it reaches that I plan to buy as much as possible and HODL. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:29:32
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:47:59
I think you were thinking of the word “convoy”.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:49:31
Set a limit order for .01 BTC at 6.5k... I’m just a protozoan swimming in a whales’ ocean. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:14:49
I’m aware of what it means, but I just can’t afford to set aside a percent of my income every paycheck to buying bitcoin. I feel like I have the time the dips properly (obviously easier said than done). I wish I was financially stable enough to be able to do that, but that’s just not an option for me right now.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:35:05
This little rise is a blip on the monthly chart. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:43:33
To buy or not to buy at 6750... that is the question. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:04:18
 Which leads me to believe I should just be patient and wait for a lower buy-in.  Then again, I don’t want to go up 20% and miss out on potential gains.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:13:24
Tom Petty and John Mayer would approve of this trend 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:37:26
The patronizing smiley faces are very annoying 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:05:12
Because it could still go lower.. if I had the money to consistently buy every paycheck I would do it. Unfortunately, I have a limited amount of fiat set aside and I want to try to buy as low as possible. I suppose I could buy in with what I have now and just buy more if the price drops much lower. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:28:42
So should I just be patient and set a limit order around 6k? I know it may be a while before we hit that price. I’m thinking maybe I’m better off buying closer to the market value now, selling at a slight profit, and buying back in lower. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:35:51
Sorry for the newb question, but what are the transaction fees for sending BTC from Breadwallet to GDAX? For now, I buy BTC on GDAX and store it on Breadwallet. But if I want to transfer some back to GDAX to sell, will I get screwed by fees?
Anyone with knowledge on this issue would be greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:35:39
Even so, if you are financially stable enough to buy a full coin now (I definitely can’t), you’d be up ~$43,000 by doing nothing. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:41:44
These last couple days are nothing to be excited about. We are still trending downward, and there’s no telling where the bottom is. Hopefully if we we can get to 4-5k, people will start buying again and we’ll see more organic growth. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:14:30
It’s getting harder to wait to buy... I’m afraid it won’t go much lower anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:13:42
I think there’s a lot of money on the sidelines thinking the same thing.
