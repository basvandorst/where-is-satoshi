So in this scenario, you expect this company, when it's on its way out, facing insolvency, and one fart away from closing up shop, to spend its last 50k fulfilling your final order of widgets/fleshlights/etc?
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:19:15
In what world do you live in that ~50k is several months operating expenses for an decent sized international supplier/manufacturer?

CEO has already reclaimed the tip because Jimmy didn't react fast enough.
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:34:00
Because each one of you douchebags "tips" 2-20 cents 
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:31:51
HOLY SHIT 20 CENTS that's amazing
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:49:31
This is not a positive development and you know it.  
WHAT IS SOMEONE GOING TO BUY WITH 6 cents??
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:41:18
ok buddy I'll check back in a couple weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:42:46
no it's just grammar and spelling going into Satan's butthole
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:31:29
I doubt they have the reserves they claim

Dude, nobody is jealous of Bitcoin's "progress." We're just getting tired of watching people delude themselves into pissing money away, and scaring away the few remaining friends they have by trying to lure them into a clear pump and dump scheme.

Or descending trapezoidal ascending triangles testing the man-bear-whale wall of $xxx but encountering resistance. 
The next two weeks are definitely critical. The price could either go up or go down, or even stay the same. That's my prediction.

Completely useless advice &amp;&amp; comment.

Massive support? Come on now, you know that's not true. Just present the facts, this hyperbole completely destroys any integrity you have left.

Haha such bullshit. OP didn't discover the root cause of this, that reward should go to the guy who actually hunted down the flaw and published it. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 12:52:05
This guy didn't discover the big, he was just a victim of it. A different user analyzed the problem and found the root cause of the issue.  He should get the bounty.

Don't blame your incompetence on "the fiat system." 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:24:01
This is unbelievable.  I am in awe of your incompetence, and I'm shocked you would even admit to this in a public forum.
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:07:36
That's not how it works at all.
