Just because you have heard it applied to bitcoin does not make bitcoin a ponzi. The way a ponzi works is the way onecoin works, even if you dont apply the word, the way it works is the same.

The halving is going to be interesting.....there will probably be a run up in price, then a dump just before the actual halving...thats what I would expect.
The real price rise will probably come a couple of months later.
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:24:04
You just proved my point. Swapping words (like you do) does not make or address an argument, you are not 5 years old. Go and learn what a ponzi is first, then try to disprove that onecoin is one. You won't be able to, but you will with bitcoin very easily. Then do something else, prove that onecoin is a crypto currency. You won't be able to. It does not have a blockchain, any forn of mining, or even a mining algorithm. There are no nodes, there are no wallets, there are no exchanges. All there is, is words. No proof of anything. Just words. Think about that. Try use it like a crypto currency, you wont be able to. Next time think before just swapping words and thinking you have "addressed" something, don't post child responses.

past performance is not the best indicator of future growth for bitcoin, since 70% drop was largely due to MTGox artificially raising the price among many other factors...and BTC has been much less volatile since settling down....also all the investment in the BTC space has not yet really come to bear fruit yet....give it a year...this time next year is also the halving of the reward....so things are looking up.

Last time? They withdrawing cash in the form of Euros, they not withdrawing BTC hence no price change due to demand...if anything it will make the price of Euro go up...

I agree with that, the problem is kids are not responsible enough most of the time....they are taught in school and at home about safe sex for example, yet there are still countless 'accidental' pregnancies and std's passed along by minors. Too much fun to be had lol, I agree with what you say about drugs, but I would still not trust kids to be responsible with the info personally

Morally its not good...why give a minor the knowledge to access such things...you KNOW they will use it, and show it to their friends too. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 07:08:26
You can buy and hold waiting for the price to hopefully go up....or you can buy one one exchange, and sell on another for a few $ more if there is that opportunity at the time.

Out of the people that do actually know about bitcoin, there is only a small percentage of people actively buying bitcoin. 3600 bitcoin gets mined daily, there needs to be a demand for that. If there is demand for more than is available, the price goes up, if not, it goes down...probably find that there are a few people who are in buy mode, but on average, most people over the last couple of years have had more important or other things to spend their money on rather than bitcoin...there is a recession isnt there? There will be a tipping point I think, as more and more people find out about and begin to use bitcoin, where the smaller percentage of buyers starts to engulf the sellers more regularly because the number of users has grown. When that happens, the percentage of buyers will start to grow too as people see more opportunity to make money and it will cycle back into full on upward trend, snowballing as the increase in buyers and price grows the amount of publicity and users, and percentage of buyers etc. Thats my feelings on it anyway....so I buy now while the price is cheap.

maybe 'morally' is the wrong word to use...i am all in favour of helping people get all the information they need, but its probably not a great idea to introduce minors to bitcoin by showing them sites where they can buy illegals...there are safer ways, but as the OP says, those ways probably wont get as much attention from the minors....where do you draw the line?

Cloud mining is not worth it, almost every time you would have more bitcoin of you had just used your capital to buy bitcoin directly than mine. That being said, genesis mining is probably one of the most legit cloud mining companies out there... At least they really have a mine and mining equipment, which a lot of cloud mining website / companies don't have. Still, given the choice, DON'T bother mining

Most merchants use bitpay, who say they are not actively selling their bitcoin right now, so even though many are cashing out daily into fiat through bitpay, its probably not causing the price to go down. Other payment providers maybe....

Do you think with 2FA sms on both my blockchain.info account and email is OK? I login with my email 2FA daily, I never remember the settings or make the computer 'safe', and also use ubuntu so I hope thats less likely to have malware than a windows pc.

Well, seeing miners is some proof at least, there have been pictures, and apparently at the next live chat session its going to be held from at a data center, so that people will be able to see miners while they are there doing the live chat. 
You are 100% right about getting as much information as possible...I am not sure they will disclose the details of how much hashing power they have or what algo etc, it would certainly put a lot of peoples minds at rest.

you have f'all protection from PP. I tried buying off a similar site about a year or more ago.

Dont use PP ever if you dont have to.

You can send bitcoin to someone without a wallet using bitx.co too, send by email

I would say if the market is working normally, then mining is only just a tiny bit profitable. If the price of bitcoin is going through the roof, then it is profitable, until the difficulty changes catch up.
Most of the time though, its NOT profitable for most people, and a real big hassle. You have to worry about space to keep the miners, your electricity costs and stability, noise, heat, hardware failure, internet connectivity etc.
It is usually better to just buy some bitcoin and hold it, you will most likely make the same profit gains if the price shoots up, but without all the problems you get with mining.
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:35:28
I am not clueless at all, I just want to see the evidence, I have been mining with them for 3 months odd and have had a great ride. I still have all my miners, if they are a ponzi, I would like to sell my miners while I still can, but I want to see what the problem is....put yourself in my position, everything is going great, and people say bad things, but then refuse to show me what happened to them

@_date: 2014-08-21 12:28:24
I have put them to the test, bought 1MH for $15.99. I am putting all the costs and maintenance and earnings etc into a spreadsheet.
The way I see it, they are mining now anyway, regardless of if a customer has bought the hashlet or not, that MH you are going to buy is already mining. 
If a customer buys hashlet mining, then they allow that customer to get the mining profits of the amount of MH they have purchased, but they charge a maintenance fee per MH per day too. It costs money to run their farm, so I would guess they do pay out the correct BTC per MH to the customers, but make it worth their while by charging the maintenance fee and the initial startup fee per MH. They say the maintenance fees will go down over time, I suspect that as they upgrade hardware all the time, and use miners that are more and more efficient, that will affect your maintenace.
They use zenpool too, which has a much higher BTC / MH rate, today its 0.00066506 per MH, which is much higher than other pools. 
So far, the 1MH Hashlet has mined 0.00069156 btc over a 24hour period. The maintenance cost was 0.00014984 btc, for a total of 0.00054172 profit for the day (not counting the cost of the miner). The 0.00069156 mined was just over 2% of the cost of the rig.

@_date: 2014-11-27 10:11:15
Everyone knows they are not really mining those pools, they have said it over and over, they pay you bitcoin at the same daily rate of those pools.
They DO have physical mining hardware, there are plenty of pictures of miners at their data center.
They have hinted a few times about mining other more profitable algos, then paying out the scrypt rate at those pools listed. 
I dont know for a fact if it is a ponzi or not...personally I paid 1.2btc for miners, and withdrew 1.8btc in total so far with my daily bitcoin withdraws, so I cant lose anything if they do tank. 
I am finding it difficult to cut off my daily bitcoin mining profits because other people say they are a ponzi. That daily bitcoin is being used to tip people, and buy things from other people using bitcoin...you people basically. 
My options are to stop getting my daily bitcoin and cash out on the miners I have there, or keep on mining and taking my daily profit. I cant lose money because I have already withdrawn much more than I put in. What would you do?
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:40:07
I have managed to get more btc out than I ever sent using GAW for cloud mining BUT, I think that was down to buying when btc was higher, so I had to earn less btc to break even again, and also the reward was higher. To buy now while the price of btc is lower is risky. I have definitely made my money back though, and get btc payouts daily :)

It will be much safer for the church in terms of transporting large sums of money, and also it will be a great way for the members to make sure their money goes to the right people. Multisig wallets can also make sure that management of funds is always above board. Good idea!

I have a theory.....A lot of newbies also bought bitcoin when the price was high in December. The price dropped and a lot of them got scared. Some sold, some held their coins. I would guess that a lot of people are spooked, and when they see that the price is now the same as what they paid for their coins originally, or maybe just a little over, they immediately sell, so that they can get out of the game without too much lost.
Usually when there is a big dip in price everything stabilizes, then when it nears the original high, there is a lot of buying and selling, probably sell orders people have put in place so that they can sell and make a profit after initially losing value on their bitcoins.

I listened to some of the people here and sold 40MH of my 50MH with GAW. I could have made an extra $400 on the price of selling them alone if I had waited until now to do that, not to mension the daily payouts that I cut off. The 10MH I kept and turned into hash stakers for the 100 Pay Con I got from GAW. At least with those I can cash them out if I want,  right now I think they are worth about $10 each odd. At least that is some nice income from GAW again when I sell those....or I could wait to see if they can sell for $20 each which is what GAW said the floor price will be.
So far I have been super happy with GAW, and while I have listened to what people say here, it did lose me money which stings a bit. The Paycoins I now have i'll just play around with, i'll keep some, sell some or whatever.
Thanks for the input anyway.

I hear you...and am thinking hard about what to do. On one hand I have got everything I asked for, and have had an excellent experience with GAW so far. They have delivered exactly what I signed up for. I am thinking of reasons to leave other than what I see on reddit. 
On the other hand people here tell me they are basically evil, and anything good I say about them gets me ton of down votes from GAW haters. I asked my friend for his input and he basically said I should go with who I trust more, now I have a dilemma. Do I trust GAW who have been great, or people here who have been not so great.

If it was old coins, the days destroyed graph would have a kitten would it not? 
"Bitcoin days destroyed for any given transaction is calculated by taking the number of Bitcoins in a transaction and multiplying it by the number of days it has been since those coins were last spent.
If someone has 100BTC that they received a week ago and they spend it then 700 bitcoin days have been destroyed. If they take those 100BTC and send them to several addresses and then spend them then although the total transaction volume could be arbitrarily large the number of bitcoindays destroyed is still 700."

Exactly, many miners stopped GPU mining bitcoin because they were not making enough profit at the time....once the cost electricity etc was more than the cost of a bitcoin, they stopped, then the price went up, now they are the ones wishing they had never turned off their miners, but at the same time, if you had spent the same amount of money on buying bitcoin, you would still be smiling now too :) 
So I say mine while you can, buy while you can....you wont be sorry.

Just great.....I have contacted my bank about my Mastercard, and the problem is that there is no transaction taking place, they say that Circle are doing an entry with a value of zero, which my bank rejects as a non transaction. They said if you make a transaction for even $1, it will then process properly, and you will be able to continue with the verification. The bank says that they do not process entries of $0 at all, and therefore will give an error 85, which rejects the entry. They have said that even with PayPal accounts, a $1 transaction is required to process, and this is apparently something that is done all around the world.

Very true, that is pretty common, I am not putting any more btc into anything right now while the price is low, so just continue to get my daily payouts. 
I am .8 of a bitcoin up on what I sent them so far, with 20k hashpoints in the bank, and 50MH in prime hashlets, so am sitting pretty :)
If I lose it all tomorrow, I am still .8 of a bitcoin in the green, if not, I can see what happens and sell the hashlets off if its going nowhere
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:49:50
If the price suddenly spikes to over 1k per btc, and then continues growing, then all the lines and things on that graph make no sense. Nobody knows what the price could be in the future, and nobody knows what events could trigger price spikes and drops, so what is the point in making a graph? Its cool to imagine where the price could go, but I dont know hey, all these graphs on reddit usually are wrong after a month or two from what I have seen.

You should be able to download the bitaddress.org files from github here: 
If you put those onto a usb stick, then go to a computer that is not connected to the web at all and open the html file. You should be able to go to the Paper Wallet link on that page. Select BIP38 Encrypt, and put in your pass phrase. As a password, use about 15 to 20 random words, seperated by a space. Remember that password or store it securely.
Once you click the generate button, it will create a new public key for you, and the encrypted private key. Copy each of those to the USB stick. Test the encrypted key by going to the Wallet details page and inserting your key, it should ask you for the password, and if you insert that correctly, it should display your real private key. If that all works correctly, you can remove the USB stick and put it into a computer that has internet access. Now you send that public key and encrypted key to the wallet maker. 
Dont forget your password, or your coins will be gone.

After actually doing some research, I see a ton of stuff about the foundation that I did not know. You guys are really doing a LOT of great work. Thank you!
Maybe being a member should be something that is removed from the foundation and a new member organisation setup for that instead. Having companies that are members turning out to either run away with peoples money or become scammers etc does not look good for the foundation. 
When a lot of money is at stake its too easy for people to just buy a membership and then use that to their advantage. I dont know how easy that is to do now, but in the past, there have been a few people that have been members and turned out to rip people off. 
If they really wanted to help, maybe they can have a badge that says "I have donated to bitcoin foundation" instead of being a 'member', or something.

Well, if it IS a ponzi, then it should be taken down to protect the customers, but doing that will probably mean lots of customers lose money when they dont get a chance to withdraw lol, catch 22. 
I would love to get definitive proof tho, I must admit I am finding it hard to simply cut off my daily bitcoin payout because people say so. Do you see where I am coming from? I get bitcoin daily and have had nothing but a great experience...if you were getting bitcoin daily, and had got your ROI, would you stop the payout, or just leave it going and withdraw daily? Be honest....you would do the same as me. BUT if they are going to go down, I would like the opportunity to sell my miners first, which is why I am questioning all these comments to see why people are saying so. Seriously tho, what would you do if you were me?
It sounds like the SEC can be used by a lot of people who have an agenda against a company to take them out unfairly if they wanted to. Maybe they do an investigation first, then decide if there is enough evidence to stop the company.

If its a multi hashlet, the payout is what Multipool paid out, if Multipool does crap, so does the hashlet. Easy enough to understand right?
The $0.08c is in USD, so when bitcoin is lower, like now, thats a big chunk out of your daily profit if you dont earn much. If bitcoin is worth more, then that is less of a chunk of your payout because 8c is less BTC. Get it? If multipool for example does great, and the price of bitcoin goes up, then it will make profit accordingly.

Some alt coins have an initial Proof Of Work phase, where they can be mined like bitcoin is mined using mining rigs, but then they become Proof Of Stake coins, and then they cant be mined anymore, and new coins are created as interest earned on coins you stake rather than with mining them. So if there is a new coin that is having a Proof Of Work phase to create a bunch of coins in the beginning, people sometimes use mining contracts or lease mining rigs to mine what they can in that phase. Usually if coin prices go up a lot, its usually the people who have mined a shitload of the first coins that make the most profit when they dump them. By the time most alt coins are trending and everyone is trying to make money and buy while the price is skyrocketing, the guys selling to all the new people are making the real money selling coins they got for almost nothing in the initial mining period. The early bird catches the worm, and day traders who want to make a quick profit on a coin with potential buy coins in a frenzy thinking they are going to make a killing, but the people who are selling them the coins profit the most.

That sounds to me like what is happening. They have a ton of hardware, are mining regardless of customers, and as you buy hashlet MHs, you get a piece of the profit, and they make their money on the initial purchase you make to enable your piece of the pie, and then the maintenance fees.

I get what you are saying....I am currently having a hard time getting my credit card registered on circle because they keep saying  my details are incorrect....even though they are. I am in South Africa, which is not officially supported, but some  people have got it to work depending on what bank you use.
Somewhere along the line, the details my bank have on file for me is different to what circle has, it might be the tel number, or email, not sure. The point is that it might be harder to fake details with circle since they check what is on file with the bank, but wont tell me what I am doing wrong. They verify your mobile number and email, so maybe by doing that method, its a lot harder to fake the account and still get verified as you actually have to control both email and mobile.

Maybe all the guys who into bitcoin should get their ladies involved with bitcoin by giving them some to spend.
My girlfriend has bitcoins now, she saw how excited I was getting and wanted to know what it was all about. I explained how it all worked and she decided to buy in so that she could have her own coins. 
Luckily when she bought her coins, the price was about $125 a coin, so she got to see her first 'crash' already, but now she is super happy, and way way more interested in bitcoin because of her financial stake in it. She has sold some on localbitcoins, spent some, and bought on an exchange, so is pretty much sorted.
Most women like to shop, so they will be excited to hear about it and how to use it if they can spend it, who doesnt like free stuff?

All the pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place with increased popularity, big companies like paypal getting involved etc its building up to something big. Bubbles will come and go, but if you remove those from the graphs, the constant upward trend is on track. 
A lot of people think the price decline from a few months ago has to do with investors simply moving money into more lucrative things as they come along, eg Alibaba, or from miners needing to cash out faster due to rising mining costs, but nobody knows for sure.

You obviously are not here to get answers, plenty of people have given you options, suggestions, solutions etc, but though don't want to hear any of it.  One reason to use bitcoin could be that you can pay workers remotely, and don't have to be on site, or leave cash with someone for them. safety wise it's less likely that you will be a target for robbery if people know you pay in bitcoin.  You can also keep track of how much you have paid workers by checking your bitcoin transactions. You might want to try being a nicer person to your workers and people on Reddit who are taking the time to help you out, don't be such an asshole man.

If you like blockchain you can try what I do. Make a bip38 encrypted paper wallet using bitaddress.org code on an offline computer. Once you have made the wallet, any time you want to spend from the address you will need to decrypt it, and use the decrypted private key. Open your blockchain account and add the paper wallet to your account as a watch only address. You should then see the balance etc like normal, but you can't send from the address. Now you have your normal blockchain password, 2fa, the secondary blockchain password for sending, and when you do try to send, you will need to scan the private key, which can only be found by decrypting it with your paper wallet password. You have all the normal blockchain functionality, but with an extra step that is actually pretty quick to do when sending once you have the steps memorized. It literally take about 30 seconds longer than normal, that's all. I use my paper wallet address to store coins, and my normal blockchain address as my hot wallet.

everybody mines scrypt coins to make money, most people dump them for instant cash, or hold them if they think they will be worth more at a later stage, if not why hold? In any case, one day they get sold, its not killing alt coins, its what gives them value being traded and mined because of that

Where is the proof that the CIA / NSA can walk through modern encryption? What do you mean by modern encryption? His windows password?
I heard they had to (and did) take him down while he was still logged on to his computer and online so that he did not have a chance log out his computer, otherwise they would not have access....encrypted drive and all...
If they could get into any encryption, why dont they take the other 600k bitcoins Ross Ulbricht has, and not only the 26k they took off his pc?
I seriously doubt bitcoin enryption is compromised.

My friend wants to take advantage of the small charges with bitcoin so that he can send money to his mother in another country, who does not understand bitcoin. He wants to get a debit card for her so that he can fund the card from abroad with bitcoin, and she can simply spend it by swiping the card or using it at an ATM. Thats a pretty cool reason why someone would want a debit card

A lot of people crying about the price are people who are suddenly traders, overnight they somehow acquired tons of trading knowledge and decided to risk it all. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, the sooner people understand that, the better.
If people can forget about the price as you suggest, they would sleep a lot easier too.

I am a happy GAW customer....still very skeptical of paycoin though. I am a happy customer because I have got more btc back from cloudmining with them than I ever sent in the first place, and still have all my 'hashlets' mining away. I have not sold any of them to get ROI. 
I think I was lucky enough to buy hashlets when the price of bitcoin was over $500, so to get ROI, I had to mine less bitcoin than if you had to buy now. Also in my favor was the fact that the zenpool was paying almost double what other pools were in the beginning, at the moment it is paying about the same as most other scrypt pools. Another thing I did was NOT reinvest profits, as far as I am concerned, you only reinvest once you have already got ROI, and I am not putting in any more btc into hashlets with them at the current bitcoin price, they will take forever to get ROI.
Now that I have got ROI on my existing hashlets, I just leave the miners to mine btc and hashpoints, IF paycoin actually does do something, great, I make some more money. If not, who cares, I have made my money, even if I lose all my miners I dont care since I am in profit. In the meantime I still withdraw all my btc earnings daily as usual, and build up a stash of hashpoints.
I must admit that I am very skeptical of the paycoin story, so dont have all my miners mining hashpoints, I mainly have them mining zenpool as I want the btc more than a coin that may or may not do something. 
I have also stopped really using the forum because I agree that it seems like most of the people are eager to punish those who question, and reward those who have great things to say.

I can only withdraw from paypal if I go and open a bank account with First National Bank here, they are the only bank here that will work with paypal. I dont want to open a whole new bank account just to be able to withdraw from paypal.
Also, I would prefer NOT to ever use paypal, because when bitcoin was still shiney and new I bought a bitcoin off a website that used paypal as payment method, and the website scammed me by never sending the bitcoin to my address. 
I was weary, but I thought by using paypal I would have some sort of protection, but they sided with the seller, and did not refund me, even though I could prove nothing was sent by showing the address had zero transactions. I hope paypal rot in hell, so I want btc as payment method.

If you have a shit ton of down votes you get autobanned, its not one person, its basically for going into the forum and talking shit to them. If you have a reputation on the forum and have a reasonable amount of posts, that wont happen. Zero previous posts, and no reputation, would mean a quick auto ban.

I have used then many times in the past, very expensive to buy btc. I am able to deposit and have limits that get less and less depending on how long you have had your account. Maybe you saw the limit for a mature account. I have seen the text about taking up to 48 hours, but I tested it last week and got my btc immediately. The fees are so confusing I tried again last week with $20 to see how much 
 btc I would get. After all their fees and deductions I got about $15 worth of btc when checking the value at the bitstamp rate.

My first purchase of hardware that I converted to hashlets has got ROI and is turning a profit nicely :)
The zen miner I got for $15.99 will be there in about 2 weeks or so I think. So far I am happy. Since I have got my ROI on my first purchase, I have used the profit to buy more hashlets, so every day I withdraw some btc, and leave some to accumulate until I have enough for a hashlet. I have withdrawn more btc than I sent in the first place, including the $15.99 for the zen, and I have more hashlets than I started with, but if you only looking at the ROI on the zen in the spreadsheet, its still got a few days to go.
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:08:39

I find a lot of people on are fanatical one way or the other, and there is a lot of 'ganging up' when someone doesnt like something. Often there are posts where a person says 'lets show them' or 'lets do this' and a ton of people get into a frenzy down voting, or harassing etc. I love bitcoin but I dont send my friends to this subreddit, I want them to see the good side of bitcoin and although there is a lovely tipping culture in the subreddit, there are people who are very quick to dump on people, swear at them, downvote them en masse if they dont like something. I understand there is a lot of hate here for GAW, but its a little silly for people to complain about the forum, when this subreddit is just as bad sometimes. We should all be a little less aggressive in our responses I think.

If you mention that you also accept bitcoin as one of the methods of payment, maybe people will start paying you with bitcoin.
There are some mobile apps that you could use to take the btc from them. You put in a figure in fiat and it will give you the corresponding amount of btc, they can then scan the QR code the app creates, and send you the btc. Your mobile will let you know almost immediately that the funds have been transferred. You can then decide to hold or exchange the btc for fiat.
You dont need to explain it to customers too much. Those that know will pay in bitcoin, those that dont, wont. You could maybe send them to a website for further information like  for information.
You cant scam the blockchain....if the customer sends the bitcoin to your address it will show that the transaction has taken place. It is very very very very unlikely that they will be able to do a double spend and take back the bitcoins.
I like the blockchain.info merchant app for mobile, it can link to your wallet and then generate QR codes for each customer total easily and quickly.

The price now is nothinng compared to the potential price once big businesses and countries start trying to buy up bitcoins to do billion dollar business deals. The market cap of bitcoin right now is tiny compared to what it could be with widespread adoption.
I remember when I thought $50 a coin was pure madness and never gonna happen. Now after leaning more about bitcoin and the technology, the applications and possibilities are basically endless. I believe it can happen.

Its mainly only people who have no trading experience who are trying to make a quick buck by playing the market who are losing their shirts.

They have miners, there are pictures of the miners. I would think they probably get electricity at a good rate too, so can have lower costs. Who is to say they are even mining scrypt for example, they could be mining Scrypt-N or X11 and then paying out what you would earn for scrypt and keeping the profit....lots of unknown stuff...but miners they have posted pictures of

I get what you are saying, I didnt before....No, I dont know if they really do....I have assumed that since they have sold tons of hardware miners to real people who have got their products, they probably have real miners.

Remind me about this in 1 year. How would bitcoin be performing if the MtGox artificial price spike was removed?
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:03:24
Most websites I use to make purchases on with bitcoin give a discount for doing so.
When I use my credit card I get charged interest on the purchases, this does not happen when I use bitcoin because I pay with what I have in my account and dont go into debt. I also dont hand over all my credit card information, and personal information to some random website where it can be stolen or hacked or sold to someone else. I prefer to not give any information to the vendor, except for the money that I am paying for the product. Using multi signature for big transactions makes it safer for me.
So what if your colleague knows what you earn or not, they could probably just look at the average wage for someone in your position to get an idea. Is it not possible to use a new bitcoin address for every transaction that you do? Your boss could do the same....which would mean 2 completely new addresses for each time you are paid, which would make it harder to track..but I dont see the point.

Paycoin fans are not going to listen to you, nor is any fan of any other alt coin that looks scammy, because everyone is greedy and wants to make some money on it. 
Probably a lot of them will make a lot of money, paycoin is around $10 and when paybase opens it should sell closer to $20, so easy  money for a lot of people flipping paycoin. A lot will hold for supposed bigger profits in the future...
Best to just leave them be....people get excited about it because its GAW, but there are plenty other coins that dont seem 100% legit out there too.

GAW is moving away from bitcoin it seems by going all-in on paycoin. So now you dont have to worry about them anymore if you are a bitcoiner, it will be like most other alt coins and have its own community. Forget about them now unless you are invested in paycoin.

Maybe you want to pay someone who cannot afford a credit card machine with a merchant account and the monthly charges that go with it, or they are in a country where they are not able to get this facility.
Maybe you want to pay small amounts, like tip someone 1$ for an article or blog post
Maybe you want to pay for something without having a paper trail on your bank statement, eg gambling, strippers etc

The problem with creating your own pool with a local community is that your pooled resources might not actually solve any blocks if it is too small, which will mean you all mine for little to no reward. People join bigger mining pools because there is a greater chance they will solve blocks, smaller pools on the other hand solve much fewer blocks and so are much less profitable. If you are mining and you are making little profit, then there is no point in joining a smaller pool if your costs are more than you are making in profit.

Thats why its best to wait until the price of bitcoin is higher before buying. If you spend less btc when buying, you get ROI faster. You just chose the wrong time to spend the BTC thats all. Lesson learned, luckily it was only $20.

some people are paid in bitcoin by their employers who communicate with them in their native language or english. Not every migrant worker does not speak english. The best way to get bitcoin is still to get paid in bitcoin. You dont need a bank account to get bitcoin if you are paid in bitcoin.
Most migrant workers send a large portion of their wages back home to family. Some employers might give them part of their salary in USD, and send the other part to a bitcoin address...OR the workers could take the USD to a bitcoin ATM and exchange it for bitcoin, then send it home. They could also use services like  to send bitcoin to family in Mexico for example, who can then have it exchanged there. They might use websites like  or  to send money to Africa. I am in South Africa, and have friends who use bitcoin to send money here, and then its exchanged at  for our local currency. Most migrant workers have some sort of relationship with their employers and can ask to be paid in bitcoin if possible.

- For me this is true so far. Always profitable...less so when price of btc is down, but that is not GAW problem...would be nice if they dropped the electricity fees though.
- They have said repeatedly you get the payout rate for those pools but dont mine on them, its on their site.
- Yep, they give you the rate from those pools, this is not a secret. I think they mining another more profitable algo, then giving you the scrypt rate, and keeping the profit....but I am not sure. Either way, they do have miners mining in the data center.
- Not sure on the scores of hardware that does not exist...dont know about that announcement. There are pictures of the data centers miners.
- They dont pay you, but you accumulate hash points for upvotes. So you are encouraged to be helpful to people in the forum to get upvotes. There is a limit to the amount of upvotes you can get per day, so that it is not taken advantage of.
- I have actually heard of that, but dont know what it means exactly....I think people are usually banned for being nasty or having a bad attitude with members, if you post with normal 'tone' of your post, then you wont be banned for asking questions of things.
- Dont know about Target...does it matter?
- Again, Target? I am not in the US so dont care about them.
- The ICO is going to be open to members at a rate of 400HP (Hash Points) per coin. You can only get that many hash points from mining on the Hashpoint Pool. 1 Hash point is supposed to be worth 1c, hence the $4 per coin. This is an area I am skeptical about I must admit.
- Again Target...??
- Dont know about NDA, I read somewhere that JG said he was not going to say names just yet because of NDA.....
- We will see if its best for miners or not....
- I think it is proof of work and proof of stake...lots of coins like that....dont know enough about pay coin tho...but I think it will be both.
- The logos are similar yes. 
- CF site was attacked yes, probably from a hacker / miner with GAW....but who did it nobody knows yet.
- PR has been going on for days now, people know JG is doing a bunch of interviews etc and they all coming out over the next few days.
- It might be odd yes, but I would say the same thing if someone said stuff about me. It will be interesting to see who is named as the hacker.

You see its not only the fact that you can send money, there is a ton of new applications now available. Peer to peer mobile payment solutions, smart contracts, multi-signature transactions, digitally signing documents to the blockchain etc all because of the technology. 
When more people use it, more people think of new ways to use it, and what else can be done with the same technology. 
Its not necessarily there to replace credit cards, but it can certainly be used along side them. You may as well start using it too, so that when it is more mainstream, you will have a better understanding of how to use it. Just think of it as an additional way to pay people to the existing ways you have now

@_date: 2014-12-24 07:38:01
mmm now I see how that can be a problem, especially for countries where they are a little backward with credit cards. In South Africa where I am from, all credit cards have a chip on them, and you are required to put in a password when using them online, I think its called 3D Secure or something similar.
From the buyers perspective, using my credit card, I dont see how I can be on the hook for anything when buying off Amazon for bitcoin. It is probably only the buyer who is using the bitcoins and who gets the goods who might be at risk if the other person is a fraud.
The US as far as I know is still way behind in credit card security, I dont think they have many cards with a chip or even have a password, and probably why millions of credit card details keep getting hacked off websites.
Good point....so nothing to worry about as a legit card holder though right? No stolen stuff coming from Amazon

yeah its got a big market cap, but that is artificial. Yes, there is a massive premine, and they basically set the starting price at $4 right, so they created their own market cap. If you create 1mil coins and then sell one for $10, then you have a $10mil market cap, easy money.
Dont get me wrong, I want Paycoin to do well, because I have some myself, but really, its no better than other alt coins. The market cap was set by them, effectively making money out of nothing and putting $$$ into GAWs bank account. Josh encourages everone to buy buy buy cheap coins while you can etc, which is basically pumping the coin. 
The use of the coin at a bunch of major retailers turned out to be a plugin for your browser, not the retailers having contracts with GAW....thats not cool.
Hopefully they will honor their $20 floor limit when they open pay base so that I can sell some paycoins :)
In the meantime they continue to push back the date, each time that happens the price of XPY dips, everyone is told to buy cheap coins and the price goes up again

multi signature transactions mean you can buy with confidence. Check out bitrated.com for the easy to understand version.

I would have paid a bit more to have a transaction with someone closer, like in the same country with the same bank preferably, or even face to face with cash.
How do you know the person is going to send you the bitcoin and not just keep your money?
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:56:47
There are no 'victims' yet are there? I am not stealing from anyone. I signed up for a product and got exactly what I signed up for. Now the GAW haters are telling me to stop mining, stop getting my daily bitcoin profit because the general feeling is its a ponzi. But I cant lose, what difference does it make if I stop or not?
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:31:19
On localbitcoins.com, if they are buying, they need to give you cash in hand, or deposit into your bank account, in which case you only release the bitcoins when you are happy that you have been paid and the money is available to spend in your bank account (if its a bank transfer). You cannot cancel the transacton and keep the bitcoin and their money, that is not possible on localbitcoins.com.
Once the bitcoins are in an active transaction you cannot get them back unless the buyer (the one giving the cash or doing the bank transfer) cancels the transaction. So the seller will only have access to the cash you give him, not his original coins.

It is a risk yes, buying mining hardware is a risk too, but the way I looked at it, I could take a small risk without spending as much as I would if I had to buy hardware, and could start earning immediately, instead of waiting for hardware to ship, and I dont have to worry about maintenance etc on my side. I might never get my ROI, but its not such a huge amount for me to lose if I do.
I would say getting into mining by cloudmining or buying hardware is a huge risk, but hopefully the price of bitcoin will rise, making it worth the risk for miners.
If it works for me, then i'll make back my bitcoin spent, and then have a small daily btc income from the miner. If not, then its only a few $ that I lost.

I get your point, but if images like the one in the link are to be believed, there are millions of potential bitcoin users in Africa. There are a LOT of foreigners in South Africa from all over Africa, flock here in search of work, and send money home to family using moneygram and western union. 
Outside of regular bitcoin use, I know people working in the UK and the Middle East who send money home to family in Zimbabwe and South Africa using bitcoin, so it has some potential for bringing money into Africa.
At a bitcoin meetup in Cape Town a few weeks ago there was a long discussion on what it would take to get some bitcoin ATMs into Johannesburg and Cape Town, which is promising. I have personally transacted with bitcoin to people in South Africa, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia...while there might not be a ton of people there who even know about bitcoin, it all starts with a seed. 
Other countries in Africa DO have internet, not always the fastest, but it is definitely usable for bitcoin in the big cities. I had no issues using the web in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia when I was there 3 years ago, granted I was only trying when we stopped to stay over in different towns, but most of the time it was OK. Botswana was no problem, even Zimbabwe had decent speeds at Victoria falls when I was staying at the camp site there and used their internet cafe, which was very suprising.

If you mine at home, you will be using a mining pool unless you are solo mining. Most people use mining pools which centralizes mining. Just because you are at home does not mean it is decentralized because you are still using one of a few mining pools. 
Cloud mining companies usually mine the same mining pools so mining at home or cloud mining is about the same when it comes to decentralization. This is why at home miners are starting to use P2Pool as an alternative, but it is nowhere near as big as the more centralized mining pools that most at home miners use.
Mining companies like GAW are not contributing to the centralization problem because they are not actually mining those big pools directly, they pay out the same rate in BTC as if you were mining there, but they dont actually mine there.

If it was more profitable to mine the people would not sell contracts, they would simply mine themselves. BTC mining contracts are a waste of time....better to just buy btc.
I think the only reason why it might be useful to have alt coin mining contracts or leasing mining rigs would be to be able to mine an alt coin during a POW phase, or if the price is shooting up, and you can mine a bunch for cheaper than buying them.

At the current price of bitcoin, I would say buy and hold. If the price goes up, you will make a packet, and you can still buy mining equipment in the future with some of the bitcoin you buy and have some left over. If you buy mining equipment now, you might not get your ROI unless you cloud mine and can start having payouts tomorrow, then I would suggest GAW, I have had good results with them. If I was in your position though, I would buy and hold for now, be cautious with mining.

Usually its POW for a certain number of blocks, then it becomes POS.
Peercoin was the first to have this concept, and a bunch of other coins that used the same concept since. "Peercoin's original innovation is the proof-of-stake/proof-of-work hybrid system. Like other cryptocurrencies, initial coins can be mined, but the core network is maintained by coin holders, rather than the fastest pool. Maintaining the network through the hybrid PoW/PoS algorithm reduces the risk of the Selfish-Miner Flaw, 51% attacks, and the block bloating that have been used to exploit other currencies. It also requires far less energy than generating hardware-intensive proof-of-work hashes. Proof-of-stake also does away with the ~$1 billion tax on the Bitcoin network through proof-of-work blocks.". If you go to  you can see the PPC fork of bitcoin, then all the subsequent forks of that are coins based on this concept.

Yes they are. The zen will get ROI the fastest if you ask me. If you get a zen at the current rate, you will probably get ROI in about 150 days-ish.
When the price of btc is low, your 0.08c per MH per day of maintenance fees is more btc, and eats into your profit. You also pay more btc for the $20 hashlet, so getting ROI is longer. If I were you I would wait a bit to see if the price goes up, then buy Zen hashlets. 
Check out one of my spreadsheets here:  
Note that at the time, I paid $15.99 for the hashlet, and that was 0.03267054.
I suggest you wait for higher btc price, then you can pay less btc, and less fees, and get ROI quicker. 
EDIT: I got the estimated days by taking todays rate for $21 which is 0,06416 then dividing that by my own average profit in my spreadsheet 0.0004962783333 = 129,26 days. Then I added an extra 20 days just because.

For added security we only allow purchases to be made by cards with the same details from your KYC information. If any of the details do not match the credit or debit card you intend to use, your purchase will fail.
Verify Your Card with Ping-A-Penny™
Before you can make a deposit via Debit/Credit Card, you must verify your ownership of the card.
To do this, you will be redirected to our payments provider to make a one-off payment which will be used to verify your ownership and confirm access to your statements with this card.
If the deposit is successful, you will then be required to provide confirmation of the amount debited from your card in this transaction."

I am personally not against it, but she is very new to bitcoin, and is still trying to understand it. She does not want to make a mistake and lose money, using an exchange to sell them on and have them depsit into her account sounds easier and safer for her than LBC. Also she will have no reputation, and will not want to meet people face to face.

To do money laundering you first have to have money that has been gained illegally dont you? The way I understand it, you have to first commit a crime, then you have 'dirty money' only then can you launder money, to make it 'clean'. Without a crime, its only you moving your own money around. Or do I have it wrong?
I use bitcoin all the time to make purchses, and when someone pays me I give them my bitpay details, keeping a percentage in bitcoin, and turning the rest into cash.

Some people were stupid enough to buy mining power from GAW when the price of bitcoin is low like it has been for a while. Anyone can see the payouts of the pools on a daily basis if you just look. Buying when the price is low means you have to earn back a lot more bitcoin before you cover your costs, even if the price goes up again. It also means the daily maintenance fees take a much bigger chunk of your earnings....anyone can work out what $0.08 is in bitcoin at the current rate, and put that against what they could earn at any of the mining pools to see that its going to be a bad idea.
I was lucky to have bought from GAW when the price was over $500, so I had to earn back a lot less, and the fees took a smaller piece of the earnings. Lots of people were reinvesting all the way, but not me when the price was dropping.
People should do their working out of profitabillity properly before investing, instead of just blaming. If the price of bitcoin goes up, lots of miners will become profitable again....but its not really going to help much if you were dumb enough to buy at a low rate.
Even so, converting to Paycoin has been a much better idea for most people, even those who are selling their paycoins now instead of waiting....its been much more profitable than mining any of the normal pools.
Hopefully you can make back some of the money you put in...to me, paycoin was a way to make bigger profits than I was with the dwindling payouts, and it has worked out great. Working out the profitability on that showed it was a no brainer.

Buy low, sell high, repeat to increase the amount of bitcoin you have. Arbitrage trading is an easy way to take advantage of the price difference on exchanges, and to grow the bitcoin you have with basically the same investment.

I use GAW. I have not tried others yet, but dont want to buy any more hashing power until the price of BTC goes up again. The amount of BTC you earn decreases as time goes on. So it makes sense to buy when the price of BTC is high.
If I were you I would wait until BTC is worth more, so that the BTC price of the cloud mining you buy is lower than it is now, opening the door to getting ROI. I have withdrawn more BTC than I have ever sent GAW, and I have not sold a single one of my miners with them. I managed this by doing 3 things.
Bought when price of BTC was higher, so that the amount I had to earn to get ROI was less.
Withdraw all BTC earned daily, never leave money in an online wallet.
Get ROI before re-investing any BTC, you only get ROI when you have more BTC back in your wallet than you sent before.

Well, I never believed cloud mining was legit, I always thought it was a scam, after all, why sell mining when you could just keep the money yourself right? I decided to take a risk and tried with GAW, to my surprise, I have got my ROI, and I have got more BTC back than I ever sent. Now they are coming out with a new coin, again, I am very skeptical, but since they have surprised me before, I am going to hang around and see what happens.
New coins start every day, but they dont have millions of dollars behind them, and are quite often run by people who stay anonymous, and try to premine etc. GAW seem to have huge plans for their coin, tons of money behind it, a proper marketing team and plan, and there is no premine / instamine etc. I am going to stick around and see what happens....if it flops, well then it flops, but at least if it does not, I'll have a couple in my pocket....could make some money, could lose out, either way I dont worry too much as I already got my ROI

Exactly right. One other point is that when you are simply holding bitcoin, you immediately have bitcoin that might take you months or years to mine after covering your costs. While you are holding bitcoin, you can also trade it if you see an opportunity that favors you. It makes zero sense to cloud mine.

Yes. I think you can actually buy with your card up to $400 per day without verification. Doing the full verification gives you much higher limits.

DPR who might not be Ross, has some evidence against him about assassination payments....not this trial though...no dead bodies either.
DPR was collecting a fraction of proceeds....still to be proven if that is Ross or not. An example of how this could change things would be if you use classified advert site, and create an advert that is for something illegal such as a stolen ipad or mobile phone. The owner of the site can then be held accountable for the illegal activity of the person who placed the advert. If the site owner has adverts on that site so is getting an income from adverts on that page, or if the seller paid to have the advert boosted or put to the top of the category, then they are also getting some money from the illegal activity too right?

"Roberts isn’t actually the site’s founder, he revealed in our interview. He credits Silk Road’s creation to another, even more secretive entrepreneur whom he declined to tell me anything about and who may have used the “Dread Pirate Roberts” nom de guerre before it was assumed by the person I interviewed. The current Roberts discovered the site shortly after its creation in early 2011. Around that time, he says, he found a security flaw in the “wallet” software that stored Silk Road’s funds. The bug could have allowed a hacker to identify the site’s hardware and steal its Bitcoins. Instead of exploiting the weakness, he helped the site’s founder fix it, gained his trust and became an active partner in the business. Eventually, the current Roberts says, he bought out Silk Road’s creator and assumed full control. “It was his idea to pass the torch, in fact,” says Roberts. “He was well compensated.”" - Forbes interview with DPR in 2013

So you will take a credit card payment from a new account without any verification as long as its below the EUR 1,000 (GBP 600) band? Is that limit the total transaction value of all time for the account, or per transaction, or per month?

You are paying for the convenience of not having to go through the channels the BTM owner is going through to get bitcoin, including some level of anonymity. 
Oners of BTMs need to replenish their bitcoin stocks for the machine, so probably have to pay for depositing that money back into the bank, transferring it to an exchange and then purchasing more. They will have to do this in person, so will be using their time to visit their machines, and to deposit at the bank. If the price fluctuates during this time, they could make money, but they could also lose a lot of money. 12% is high IMO, though. Why dont you just buy on an exchange and then be a living BTM to your friends. You can charge them a small fee and take their cash in person, and transfer from your mobile to theirs.

My lady is into bitcoin, she likes money and being able to spend it with little hassle. The only reason there is a lot more men in the bitcoin space is probably because there are a lot of computer nerd guys out there that were first to get into bitcoin, and tell their nerdy friends.
As it gets more mainstream, there will be more ladies involved. Its not a sexist thing, its just because ladies have not been exposed to bitcoin as much as guys.

Buying on one exchange where the price is low to sell on another exchange where the price is high, creates buying pressure on the cheaper exchange. Everyone else realizes they can also make money and starts to sell for a higher amount because they know people will pay it so that they can sell on the other exchange. At some point the prices even out and it does not become viable anymore...which is why most exchanges are about the same value for bitcoin. With mtgox there was a problem on the exchange, the price was higher, so all other exchanges started to rise too, but there was a problem getting your money out of mtgox if you had USD, so all the people on mtgox wanted to buy your bitcoin so that they could move it out of mtgox, so that added to the price going up. Everyone would think they could get a great price for their btc on mtgox, but then they could not get their money out, or it would take ages to get it.

Before the drops seemed to be much more sudden. In 2011 the price went from around $30 to around $10 in about a day, before losing almost 90% over then next few months. 
Yes, it was a lot more people using it as funbux, but there were also some serious players buying tons of bitcoin who made fortunes. I think a lot of people tried to get rich quick by buying a lot when the price was being manipulated by MtGox. 
You only lose your money when you sell at a loss though, and I believe the price will go up again, just like it has many times before...but people who have a lot at steak might not have time to wait, or might want to cut their losses. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:28:39

Ross is Not guilty. Seriously though, he has not been found guilty of anything yet, so technically he is still innocent of all any and all charges.
IF there is enough evidence, and he is guilty of masterminding Silk Road, then I think the jury should still find him not guilty through jury nullification. The jury should refuse to confict on the grounds that it being a victim-less crime, and should find him not guilty regardless.

The problem is that you cannot move your money between your bank and the exchanges quick enough. You might be able to buy bitcoin on one exchange, transfer it to the other, and sell it at a higher rate, but then you are fucked because you cannot get your money and profit out of that exchange for weeks or months. All you can do is buy bitcoins again, at the high rate, and try transfer them out, so that you can sell them at the low rate and loose your profit. Dont take my word for it though, try make some money, do it and see...

The SR website was a tool for people to be able to sell those things, if he is DPR, he did not actually sell the stuff himself, he just ran the website. Its like the owners of Craigslist site being responsible for what people post on there...yes the SR site was marketed towards drugs, but he still did not actually sell the stuff. SR provided a platform for people to buy what they were going to buy anyway, they just could now do it pretty anonymously in the safety of their own home, instead of putting their life at risk in the real world to do the same thing. The website removed the danger aspect for both sellers and buyers, less risk of getting stabbed or robbed or ripped off. People are going to buy drugs anyway, why not eliminate the danger to your life, keep the dealers off the street corner and on the web instead. I think its better for everyone.

Probably not very well. Technically transactions can be done via text message, sound, even infra red, any way that data can be sent and recieved but it is rare, most people use the net. Most credit card machines use telephone lines that I know of, so they are subject to outages as well, but usually people just wait or try later, they will probably do the same with bitcoin. The same goes for ATMs, many times when there is problems with power or connectivity, they are out of order, people just wait and try later
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:12:49
bank charges for just about everything. Typically there are account fees, statement charges, internet banking fees and fees for any any other facility you want added. ATM fees are a rip off, especially if you use a bank ATM that is not your native bank. Heaven help you if a debit order is unable to come off, then they really nail you.

@_date: 2015-01-09 22:06:27
They are probably both the same. But the trezor does not have to be in the safe, only your seed list of words does. You can keep your trezor on you, while a paper wallet could get broken or damaged, a trezor should be fine.
As long as you have your seed words somewhere, you can get your money if something had to happen to the trezor.
One with a paper wallet normally you generate it and print it out at bitaddress.org. I dont think you get to see any seed words like the trezor.
Another thing is that every time you use the trezor, it can give you a different address, so its more difficult for people to know how much money you have in total. With a single paper wallet all your funds are on one address which is easy to see. With the trezor you could have a bunch of different addresses.
With the trezor you can also import your seed into some mobile wallets if you lose the trezor. You can also put on a second password on the trezor, so even if your trezor is stolen, the funds are safe without the password.
I have both a paper wallet and a trezor, and I prefer the trezor.

@_date: 2015-01-21 11:10:02
No. The reason so many people in defend him is because they think he should be found innocent regardless of the evidence.
Why? If is is DPR, then he ran a marketplace where other people were able to sell anything, legal or illegal, for bitcoin. That would make him a hero to some people because he would have been removing the violence factor from peoples lives who were going to take drugs anyway, and replaced it with a safer cleaner way to operate where nobody get hurt. Lots of people think he should be found innocent because they dont think he should be held liable for things other people sold on SR. If he is found guilty, then it sets a precident for the future, that any website owner can be held responsible for things users of the website do. People also think even if he is found guilty he should not be punished as providing the platform is a victimless crime.
People think if he is not DPR, then he has had a really crap time for doing nothing wrong and he needs our help.
His defense has said he started the SR website but passed it on to another person who took the role of DPR, and the DPR who ran the SR was not him.
This claim was brought up in an interview with Forbes magazine in 2013, when they had an interivew with DPR and verified it was him with his GPG signature.
In that interview DPR confirmed that he was not the first DPR, and the way that DPR spoke etc in the interview is not very much like the way Ross Ulbricht is at all. 
The prosecution does not want that interview to be allowed to be used by the defense.

with the trezor you can plug it into your PC and then use the coins on there pretty easily. It generates a new address every time you need to send coins to the trezor so it also allows you to have a lot of coins on there using a ton of different addresses, disguising your total balance. Once its plugged into your PC and you have logged into it, you can use it pretty much like a normal web based wallet.
I have one and use it all the time, its a nice way to ensure my coins are pretty much safe.

There have been many price declines, my experience with this has taught me that unless you know what you are doing and have a proven history in stock market in day trading, its better to not try and play the market, but rather hold. The price always goes back up....since bitcoin started a lot of people people have suddenly decided they have a talent for day trading....when in reality they know jack shit.
Personally I buy on the down trends, and if I need cash, I sell on the up trends. People who sell on down trends are generally losing money unless they bought much earlier on when the price was really low, but thats not many people. When I see cheap prices like now, I consider it a bitcoin sale and buy what I can :)

its based on the price so changes as the price changes and amount of bitcoins in circulation change

There are many ways to hack an exchange. Most of the time the hacker gets access to the main wallet or hot wallet of the exchange, where they are sometimes holding clients bitcoin that is being exchanged. The hacker then tranfers the money out of that wallet into one they control.
If exchanges use a different type of wallet, like a multi-signature wallet, then they cannot run away with your money because they need a signature from you to authorize transactions. A hacker would also not be able to steal your bitcoin as they would also be unable to transfer ownership of bitcoins without your authorization.

Your wallet had 0.0091 BTC in it before that was safe. If it was not, it would have also been transferred. Something was compromised since 2015-01-17 when the previous bitcoin balance was OK. Did you click on any email notification links? It looks like it happened as soon as you deposited new funds, I would double check what exactly you did today, that would have leaked that info.....never click on any email links to blockchain.info....

I agree that a Bitcoin Embassy would be much better, especially if it were in a prominent place like the VA Waterfront in Cape Town or similar places around the country. Not much at all happening from the foundation, and the few meetups there were last year organised by them were not well supported. From the standpoint of introducing people to bitcoin and running workshops, its not happening from what I can see.

You add to the sell pressure, same as others, all trying to sell en Masse, this makes the price go down even more.  People just like you made the price drop in the first place. If you lost money, you know why. Thank you for the cheap coins, many of us appreciate it.

If I were you, I would sell it on localbitcoins.com then, or go stand next to a bitcoin atm and offer buyers a better rate for their cash...even better would be to contact an ATM owner and sell them a bunch for the cash in their machine.

Every transaction is visible in the blockchain, that's how it works from day 1.
If you buy bitcoin with your ID verified from a website, and transfer that to an address that is used to do illegal things, you have just linked your real ID to a crime.
Bitcoin can be anonymous if you take steps to make sure there are no links, but everyone knew this from the beginning.

A big problem with some of these places is their currency is so crap, that to buy an ATM is way out of most peoples budget. EG In South Africa the 1 USD = R15 odd. That 'feels' to a local here that the ATM is 15x the price....not to mention the cost to get it here, and customs duties, and taxes, and then paying some sort of rent in a store to give it a safe home. Add on to that the problem that everyone wants the going market rate for BTC or close to it at an ATM....which means small profit margins. Some Latin American countries have a far worse exchange rate. The only way they will spread faster in these regions, is if the ATM companies gave MUCH cheaper prices, or subsidized ATMs to users in these regions, or if they were somehow sponsored or something. Everything is way more expensive in these regions, an ATM might be relatively cheap where you are, but definitely not for us :(
Everyone wants and ATM here, people are asking all the time where the closest one is etc, but they are very few and far between.
On the plus side, its pretty easy to buy bitcoin in South Africa from a local exchange...

You take the amount you want to pay, and divide it by the price of 1 bitcoin, then pay only that amount. So if bitcoin is $1180, and you want to pay $30 then it will be: 30 / 1180 = 0.02542 BTC.

I use an awesome site called blocktrail.com. If you have an account you can look up addresses, then bookmark them under one name, and the totals will be added.

surely, if there is a lot of people selling, there is still a lot of people buying those sales, so what does it matter if you hold or someone else holds the coins you sold? Also, if everyone is selling to 'not support' BU, surely that is going to make a big rise in transactions to fill the blocks more, and give more fees?
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:56:26
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:19:19
But if it has the majority of hashing power, surely it will be?
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:39:16
To get all the BU supporters who "want bigger blocks now" and that is the main reason why they are supporting BU, onto the core side. Even Roger Ver likes segwit, but says they need bigger blocks now. If core did it first, safely, it would be better. The community that rejected blocksize forks was mainly 'core' community of followers. It would unite the community....everyone wants bigger blocks, this is a fact, just that nobody can agree on how to do it.

Not a shill account....just being realistic. In a company, if there is a takeover, there are casualties, and often even though one way might be better, its not the path chosen by those in charge.

There is zero other options. I HAVE to upgrade, and when the password fails, it says "A second password is required to upgrade". The only option is to start again or be logged out. I cant do anything else at all.

If the majority of mining power is supporting BU, and the hard fork happens, does the majority chain now dictate the specific structure of what bitcoin is? Would the smaller chain using the 1mb limit, not be giving any hashing power on what would then be considered 'bitcoin'? I am really confused, but I am probably like the majority of users...
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:55:22
this one: 
I put in my 12 words, the button to continue does not activate, so I cannot proceed.
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:27:42
Even when it was worth almost nothing, it was still succeeding in terms of working as a transfer of value between people, so it has already succeeded in reaching that goal, in terms of being as useful as a credit card, I think 99% chance of success. Even if it was loaded with extra charges etc like credit cards are, its still going to be as useful.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:59:14
No, they are insisting that the reason the button does not become active is because the words are 'incorrect'. I dont know how the script knows if the words are incorrect or not, since they could be an infinite amount of combinations...but they insist its because the words are wrong.

Since I have been using bitcoin I was always under the impression that if the transaction was big enough in terms of the amount of bitcoins being sent, there is zero fee needed. So for example, if I sent you 500btc, I dont need to put in a fee, and it would go through without any problems....but if I had to send you 0.1btc, I would need to still include a fee to incentivize the miner to process it.
@_date: 2015-05-14 08:00:29

The multibit from the link you gave is allowing me to import from the json file now :)
It also wanted the 2nd password, and I used the one that I know to be correct, that blockchain.info says is NOT correct, and now it is importing....doing a synchronize, and hopefully after that I can transfer to my hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:47:49
Its shit like that, that further divides
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:44:29
I support core, but if Unlimited is going to win with mining power, I think working with that and having some influence, instead of no influence might be better than splitting or POW change. I have much more faith in core team to be honest, but there must somehow be a way for everyone to get along, instead of split...which could really mess things up for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:15:13
If SegWit is activated, blocks wont be full for a very long time, so there will be no need for an upgrade to 2-4mb anytime soon after. That being said, why cant an upgrade in the future STILL be planned, so that for example, IF blocks are on average over a certain percent full, then the upgrade to 2mb will be the next step after consensus is reached? 
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:45:56
Some websites have addresses associated with them. eg silk road. Some people have addresses that are known to be theirs. The blockchain explorer probably just publishes any info that is publicly known about the address
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:32:32
Of course they are mining for profit, not for being nice guys. They are businessmen more than anything and are making sure they run their business properly, and that it will continue to be profitable in the future. The best way to defend against BU, is to have more hashing power.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:10:09
I thought segwit would cut down the on chain transaction volume and bloat in the blocks, and on top of that, would be more efficient with the space. I think that even if the transaction volume doubled in 12 after segwit, it would still not be full blocks again, since more people would be using segwit and its benefits
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:47:44
Yet its still here, number 1, regardless.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:45:45
Yes, I installed, and then imported the json wallet backup I had from when I signed up for the wallet....it also asked me for my same passwords, which then gave me access to my bitcoin. I did not use the 12 words with the old version of multibit since I had the wallet file.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:19:01
I see your point
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:22:01
nobody did, I agree, but it is what it is. Why not make the best of a bad situation, and try to still have some influence, instead of none? I suppose the same can be said for BU supporters about having something they dont agree with shoved down their throat (segwit), hence they are doing what they can to avoid that.

@_date: 2016-06-26 03:07:23
Nothing, it's easy to buy so that's not the problem. The price is higher that it is if you simply convert the USD rate to Rand though. It is expensive and a hassle to send money out of the country, and there are limits to how much you can send, so not many people risk it with bitcoin, and those that are buying it generally buy from one of the local exchanges at the inflated rate. Even at the higher price though, it has been a great investment.

You can buy some bitcoin with dollars, or any currency really. Just because YOU use dollars, and will use and exchange that is local to you, then you will use a dollar exchange price. If you want to buy bitcoin using Euros, then use a different exchange and use that currency and price.

Dump those chumps and get a  card, its great. It keeps your balance as BTC until you swipe or use the card, then it does the conversion. So basically you are subject to the volatility of bitcoin....and thats been a good thing of late. Its also VISA not mastercard...

Coinsbank should be fine, it's a visa debit card you fund with bitcoin, so anywhere visa is accepted it will work like a charm. Used mine in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana without any hassle. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:43:59
Coinsbank.Com has a great card that links to your wallet. Only when you use the card is the amount needed calculated and converted at the current exchange rate, and taken out of your bitcoin wallet. It is not like other cards that are just regular debit cards that you fund with bitcoin. Your balance is always in bitcoin. I use mine all the time while travelling, and have it linked to airbnb and uber. It is a visa card so is accepted almost everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:13:45

I remember when it used to be because of Roger Ver, that was the reason segwit was being held back, but apparently now its not. I thought that maybe he controlled so many miners, because everyone here was making it sound like segwit not progressing was because he was paying miners or something. Now its a different story...who knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:11:57
No. I was asking a question, hence the question marks "so he pays like 75% of miners? Can you show me where it is clearly shown?". I dont 'admit' anything, I was asking that if he is supposed to be paying miners, where can that be shown to me. Can you show that please?

Is it correct to say then, that all miners are going to take an approx 13% dip in daily earnings as soon as the new difficulty kicks in?  1 / 1.16 = 0.0862, 1 - 0.0862 = 0.137 or 13.7% right?

Because if you buying bitcoin you are probably not buying gold from him. It's in his interest that you buy gold from him and give him your money instead of buy bitcoin. He only likes bitcoin if you use it to buy his gold... He was accepting payment in bitcoin on his website through bitpay... That was OK, because he was getting the money. So bottom line, he just wants your money.

@_date: 2017-01-22 06:19:31
Awesome idea, I would just make some suggestions though... Buy miners one at a time as you need them, and cut your amount down by 50% then use the other 50% you are going to spend on miners to buy bitcoin. As the price of bitcoin goes up over the years, you can dip into your bitcoin holdings and earnings to replace non profitable miners with new ones. It will be a lot more sustainable and profitable long term.

You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin. If you want gold, do you only buy it in full bars? No you don't, you buy some gold to the value of what you are willing to spend. Same with bitcoin. Buy some every week or every month so that it all adds up, and does not seem like a large purchase in one go. It's less to risk than one purchase, and you get a dollar coast average price. The idea is to increase your bitcoin over time. You can do that easily and in small amounts by buying bitcoin. When you mine you have bigger risk, and you also never have any bitcoin profit until you have mined enough BTC to cover all your costs, which often takes years. So by mining you are basically locking your money away to maybe, hopefully, use some of it in the future to get some bitcoin. You will always get more bitcoin if you just buy some now, than in the future, unless the price crashes heard, and is worth less. The mining difficulty is always increasing though, so going forward your mining profit is always on a downwards trajectory. So miners of the future will always earn less BTC per TH than miners of the past. Based on past performance, I would say that buying now is the better choice. In the future bitcoin will be worth a lot, so personally I only sell some at a profit, so that I can buy back more later, and I never sell all my BTC. Arbitrage trading allows you to make profit by talking advantage of price difference on exchanges.

for every seller, there is a buyer....if there is so much selling action, there is also a lot of buying action.

Even then, there are lots of buyers with buy orders further down in price who are counting on price dumps so that they can snap up cheap bitcoin.

They need to be warned, then left to get burned. When they do, you can help them to just buy bitcoin.

Once they have been burned, they will listen to you, until then, just give all the facts

why make them when its cheaper and less risky to just buy them? Making them costs you money and time, internet data, and can have problems like hardware failure / troubleshooting / repairs, noise, heat, etc. When you buy miners you are not profitable for months and months if you are lucky. If you are unlucky you might take over a year to get your return on investment, or maybe never. 
If you just buy bitcoin you have it INSTANTLY, not in months or years. You also can sell it instantly if the price is tanking and you want out, or if the price spikes and you want profit. If you put all your money into mining, you might never ever get back what you invest, while if you buy bitcoin, the reward to risk ration is much much better. Listen to what people are telling you....if it sounds too good to be true, it is.

It is the rate of bitcoin creation before it goes to zero after halving every 4 years. It started at 50 btc reward per block every 10 min for 4 years.  There are 210240 blocks in 4 years time period, so I think it was then rounded to 210000 as the halving amount. The supply rate was halved to 25 btc per block after 210000 blocks, then 12.5 after the next210000 blocks, which is where we are now. Every 210000 blocks the reward halves, and by the time the reward goes to zero, and the least bitcoin is mined, there is around 21 million in total.

Most people have no idea or understand the process of a credit card transaction or bank wire, but they are still used by everyone. 
If you are not a programmer, you probably wont understand the code. You can learn how bitcoin works from basic intro videos, dont worry about the complex stuff.
Bitcoin becomes more popular as people get shafted more by their banks, countries, and the 'system'. Take everything you hate about banks, remove it from the equation, and you sort of have how bitcoin is, when you compare them.
There are no bitcoin servers to take down...people run nodes and miners on their own networks.

cant visualize lots of coins that were never there. I think many of the 'coins' were from people depositing cash, on the Mtgox system they were reflecting in your balance, but that was just the software, many of those coins were never in existence. Only if you managed to withdraw coins, then real coins were sent to your wallet. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:11:18
You keep saying the loan cannot be withdraw, so then how is the person getting the money?!?! If they cannot withdraw, then they get nothing correct?
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:32:20
How does that work? I mean, did you send out of your wallet into the 1Pjb2vHTussuYjYf7mZL68LU41U6WVpTAj  wallet, or was it an automated process? Is your address 12264YHxBJqMPJYsnbkjcFpNKW9Ur2JNo7 ?
It looks like a few of the last withdraw transactions had a high fee, is that something that is automatically done, or do you set that? Just wondering if the withdrawals at with the high fees might all be related is why I am asking. Maybe you can somehow tie a user to one of those transactions if they are

If you buy for $200 now, and the value goes up to $500 in two months, then yes, you can sell it and to anyone for $500 if that is the going rate. You can sell it faster if you sell it below the going rate, such as $495

When a person or group with a huge hashrate stops mining, the difficulty change when it is recalculated surely? Even when they are mining with such a hash rate, they are not alone in mining, even at the highest difficulty, there are always other miners
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:32:14
When the chain splits, and if miners who signed the NYA move majority power to B2X chain, the bitcoin blockchain will grind to a halt. The B2X chain on the other hand will be the regular 10min-ish per block. So you will not be able to dump any bitcoin unless you already have it on an exchange. It would be very hard for loads of people to dump bitcoin if they cannot even get their bitcoin to the exchange. It will be extremely easy for lots of people to dump their cheaper B2X coins though....which could increase downward pressure and drop the price further.
So bitcoins price could be kept higher, and the B2X chain could dump hard, just because of the bitcoin difficulty.
So if people are buying to dump, its more likely the B2X coins being dumped, not bitcoin imo

I just got back from Argentina where I was there for a month traveling. I went with bitcoin to sell to fund my travels. Did not sell any.   
I expected tons of people to be wanting bitcoin. It was not like that. Hardly anyone knew what it was, and the ones who did, were not keen to buy from me. Even when I offered it at a discount price, just so that I could get pesos to pay for things on my holiday, they were not interested. I joined facebook groups and chatted to people there who were mostly scammers looking for me to send bitcoin first....no person wanted to meet face to face for cash. I joined Telegram groups and those guys were more interested, but none of the guys I chatted to actually followed through. The best I could get was to have some of them suggest I just go and sell it on a bitcoin ATM. I did go and find an ATM, but was not able to sell bitcoin with it since it was not working properly.   
Was a bit of a bummer for me, since I was really hoping to sell some bitcoin there to fund things.
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:54:40
I reckon it will be around $1500 odd. Its all about supply and demand, and I think there will be a lot more turmoil in the financial markets this time next year, many more people will be moving money to gold, bitcoin and other safer places...so I think there will be a much greater demand for BTC. I also think there will be more demand for bitcoin from companies that might need it to run their businesses using blockchain technology. There is a lot of new businesses starting that have had funding over the last year or so that will start bringing their products to market next year. Many of them will need bitcoin, or the users of their products will need bitcoin or an altcoin to run, that can be purchased with bitcoin. Some companies are developing products that will need a constant supply of bitcoin (Gyft), so demand will increase from users, and also the company will need holdings to run it properly. The reward halving is going to also push the price up a bit too. So basically if you combine the reward halving, with the demand by all the new bitcoin businesses and new bitcoin users who want to use those products and services, as well as more people becoming aware of bitcoin and wanting to use it to move or store money due to financial market turmoil...I reckon it will be at least $1500 odd.

M-pesa is not distributed system, there is a company controlling it and everyones accounts, and they have the power to stop payments or close accounts etc. You cannot send M-pesa to someone outside of the country of Kenya, to someone in South Africa for example who also has M-pesa, so that sucks and is one of the reasons I closed my M-pesa account.
Another issue is that to use M-pesa you have to sign up with the company and do all the KYC stuff, so you cannot just create an account and start using it like with bitcoin.
When I signed up my account was not able to verified because after hours of customer service calls and going into the offices twice, it was discovered that the reason was that my name on their system did not have uppercase letters for the first letter of my first and last name! In order to fix this, I would have to travel back to a branch to speak to another representative with my identification documents, during office hours, to rectify the problem, and verify my account properly. So I just gave up...too many stupid people problems....bitcoin I can get running and it can work much faster, and without all the red tape.

"Developers and miners reached a Hong Kong consensus which clearly stated that segwit and a 2MB hardfork will both be deployed. " - Only one part of that has been done, the segwit part, and no plans for the second part, hence, no segwit signaling from Jihan Wu.
The Hong Kong agreement was reached at the height of the scalability debate when miners almost unanimously rejected Bitcoin Classic in favor of binding themselves to Bitcoin Core on the condition that a maxblocksize increase is merged in the Bitcoin Core client at or around the same time as segwit. (
We could get segwit very soon, IF the block size is increased too, and NOT including the size 'increase' because of segwit.

I think what people are saying is that the problem is no date or set time for a 2mb hardfork after segwit. Without a schedule of when one will be done after segwit, the feeling I get is that miners dont believe it will happen. So by putting one in place, they will be more inclined to activate segwit. Why not just say that x number of days or blocks etc after segwit, there will be a 2mb hardfork. If that plan is in place, then peoples reasons for rejecting will be gone. Didnt even some core devs say segwit would work better with an upgrade to the blocksize anyway? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:35:33
What is gold backed by?
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:48:41
The miners will signal for segwit in bitcoin just like litecoin, when there is a blocksize increase planned like in litecoin. If core just did that, instead of going on and on about how segwit is a blocksize increase, you would get segwit on bitcoin, as it was originally planned.

Sounds like you never had the money in the first place, as it was not confirmed, and now you want Bitgo to give it to you, because that is what should be in your balance. The person you should speak to is the one who was supposed to send you the money. That person is at fault for double spending, and you are at fault for accepting that the transaction is complete, when it has not had proper confirmation. Not bitgo's fault.

Based on my experience this is not true. Almost every person in Africa who contacts me about bitcoin wants to get rich quick, and is often already involved in a ponzi or similar 'system' or 'platform'. The most common thing people ask is how to join, how long before they are a millionaire, and how much do they make monthly.
(I live in South Africa and have a FB page with &gt;75k members, a FB group with &gt; 10k users, and have a bitcoin website for locals with around 3k unique visitors a day.

Who insults people for making a profit? Thats the point isnt it? Hodling and buying all the way down is working out great so far....seems to be playing out the same way it has many times before. I dont spend all my capital at once, just keep buying regularly all the way down to dollar cost average. 
The point is to buy cheap and sell high, thats how traders make a profit. If you do it the other way around you are doing it wrong. 
Bitcoin is now cheaper than before by quite a long shot...so a buying opportunity for me.
The drop in price was as predictable as the next hike in price is. Bitcoin has a hype cycle that repeats over and over. It will go up, it will go down, so to make money, which you should be doing, you buy when everyone is selling, and sell when everyone is buying.

people who are new to bitcoin panic sell. Old bitcoin people pick up the cheap coins....and there is a LOT of new people in bitcoin.
The China market is like 15% of the market right now, where it used to be like 90% of the trading. So people are over reacting. In 2013 the PBOC, told third party payment providers that they can no longer work with Bitcoin exchanges. People could not get money in or out of exchanges, and the price of bitcoin dumped....but then it got fixed and the exchanges came back up. At the beginning of 2017, China was the biggest trading market, then PBOC started investigating exchanges, margin and futures trading got halted, the price dropped from over $1000 to the low $800s...then things got back on track.
Now ICOs have been banned and exchanges that sold them are being investigated...maybe they will need a license or to be regulated, who knows.....but what will happen for sure, is things will start up again and get back on track.

Bitcoin is not for you. Did you not understand that you would lose money if you sold for less than you bought for? The idea is to buy low, then sell high. If you dont want to make a loss, dont sell at a lower price than you paid.

not true. payfast allows websites to accept bitcoin, which is instantly converted to Rand....but that feature is not used anywhere near as much as normal payments. I know people who use payfast on their website and didnt even know that is an option. It is not being used in major grocery outlets either, the headline is very misleading.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:11:43
people who are new to bitcoin panic sell. Old bitcoin people pick up the cheap coins....and there is a LOT of new people in bitcoin.
The China market is like 15% of the market right now, where it used to be like 90% of the trading. So people are over reacting. In 2013 the PBOC, told third party payment providers that they can no longer work with Bitcoin exchanges. People could not get money in or out of exchanges, and the price of bitcoin dumped....but then it got fixed and the exchanges came back up. At the beginning of 2017, China was the biggest trading market, then PBOC started investigating exchanges, margin and futures trading got halted, the price dropped from over $1000 to the low $800s...then things got back on track.
Now ICOs have been banned and exchanges that sold them are being investigated...maybe they will need a license or to be regulated, who knows.....but what will happen for sure, is things will start up again and get back on track.

If I had a new S7, and bitcoin cost me cheaper because it uses less electricity, I would still sell it at the current going rate and take more profit, why would I suddenly sell for much cheaper just because its costing me less? If I need to sell badly, and everyone else is in the same boat and selling cheaper and cheapter then fine...but if its costing less to mine, you can sell less to cover the same costs if you sell at the current-ish price.

no, your wallet address will normally start with the number 1 if it is a regular address, and 3 if it is a multi-signature address.

The last time I was there, I went to 3 banks to walk in and get cash before I could get any USD....they only use USD there, ZIM dollar is long gone, and they had issues getting me the money I wanted so I had to go to another bank. I went to 2 ATMs and the one worked, but not for my card which was mastercard, the ATM was VISA only...the other ATM was just a hole in the wall, the ATM was missing.
I eventually ended up walking across the bridge, and over the border, from Vic falls into Zambia. Once over the border I used the ATM, and walked into the bank and converted the money to USD, no problems. Then I walked back over the border to Zim to continue my journey.
Apparently its not much better since that time, which was about 5yrs ago. 
Any bitcoin prices in Zimbabwe are probably not 100% true either...what is the volume on those prices, I think its almost nothing....most people there dont have money for bitcoin.

I also still use them, but I dont generate new addresses that hold bitcoins, I have a watch only wallet on their interface, which is a bip38 encrypted paper wallet. I generate new addresses for people to send to, then I usually transfer that to the paper wallet address, or my trezor address. I have a number of watch only addresses added. I also have 2 factor with text message verification, and a second password....and every address that actually holds bitcoin for longer than a few hours is a watch only address I have added. I like to be able to have a total of all my bitcoin wallets displayed, and also if I need to, I can send from any of the wallets if I put in all the passwords and god forbid, the private key to send.

The probability of predicting the price of bitcoin, which is influenced by tons of entirely random factors and their affect on the people who might decide to buy or sell because of them, is no better than guessing, either you will be right or wrong...there is no 'technical analysis'. Thats just a fancy speak for 'guess'. Some people get lucky, and that makes them think they are awesome at predicting the price, so they continue to believe it. People get addicted to it just like gambling...always thinking they can predict the next price change...at the end of the day its still a guess. If you are one who gets easily addicted to gambling, stay away from speculating, you could lose it all.

Its not only about the % fee, though, with normal banking, you have to go during banking hours, pay a currency conversion fee sometimes, take the banks version of the exchange rate, sometimes there is a once off fee to get your money put into your bank account too, you also have to have valid ID, proof of address etc too, and sometimes there are limits on accounts.

That will cause a stir :) Cameras are only a problem if you are the kind who does not want anyone to see their face. If you can't do the deal in a bank, it does not give the seller much confidence. You could just pull a gun and take the bitcoins and keep your cash, or if could go the other way round. Use a bank, keeps everyone on the straight and narrow. In the future banks will only be used as places to perform secure bitcoin transactions safely. Lol. once the banks crash and bitcoin moons, that is.

The government of any country could slow down the trading of bitcoins on regulated exchanges by making it difficult for them to operate, eg closing their bank accounts so that nobody can deposit.
They will not however be able to stop the actual bitcoins from going between accounts. If you accepted cash for bitcoin, there is no way that could be feasibly policed on a large scale, unless maybe you were singled out and there was some sort of sting to catch you. The transaction could still not be stopped, but you might be charged if it was illegal to do that.
So basically short of turning off the internet, bitcoin transactions are like cash transactions in the real world. You cant really stop people from transacting with each other, but you could make it difficult for exchanges in your area to operate.

Mpesa is crap, and the people running it are morons.
Mpesa does not work over borders, you are confined to the country that you are in. 
With mpesa you also have to open an account with the service provider, so need proof of address, ID, and an account with the mobile service provider too.
There are limits to your transactions on how much you can transact per day / month etc
I tried using it, signed up and had issues from the service provider because they made a mistake capturing my name on their system. They did not use uppercase for the first letter of my name and surname, so my account was downgraded to small tiny transactions with even more limits until I personally went with my ID and proof of address back to the branch to fix the 'mistake' that they made. They could not simply change the letters to uppercase on the system. Because of this I just cancelled.
In South Africa there is  which basically does the same thing, but with bitcoin instead of mpesa currency.

Technically you are correct, but that does not mean they will. Most casinos strive for a good reputation and to keep players coming back to spend more bitcoin. They would not be in business very long if they stole customers money, so usually they dont. You cant go through life not doing everything because technically its possible something bad could happen. Look at the reputation and age of the casino, and stick to the popular ones. They are popular for a reason.

You can prove it yourself, that is why its provably fair. The result of the roll etc is decided and hashed, and they provide the hash as proof. There can only be one answer, or the hash would be different. You then play your round, and they reveal the answer. You can prove it is the answer that was decided before you even played by hashing it, and it should be identical to the hash they provided BEFORE you played your round. So they are proving that they are not changing the result to suit themselves. Every game provides a hash of the result before you play your turn, so regardless of what your decision is in the game, the answer is already set, so they cannot cheat.

I think with any of these kind of clients, you create the private and public keys yourself on your computer or device, so you can export them for safe keeping somewhere if you wanted to, or the seed and password that you used. You can then probably import them into another program if you decided not to use the original software anymore. I dont think these programs like Mycelium and Electrum keep your private keys at all, as far as I know that is all on your side, so you can trust them

The problem is not bitcoin, the problem is Ukraine, they make it difficult to use bitcoin there. I dont think there are any official exchanges anymore since the government clamped down. There are people buying and selling on localbitcoins, so if you had sent bitcoin, they would have been able to trade it there themselves, or you could have advertised it there, and used the banking details of the freelancer as the location where the buyer would have to pay for the bitcoin, once they pay the freelancer, you can release the coins.

Anyone can use bitcoin internationally, not like Mpesa which you can only use if you are a subscriber to that network, and it cant be used internationally. With bitcoin you are more anonymous as well, with Mpesa it is linked to your mobile phone and that is linked to your identity and physical address. Problems with the service provider mean problems with Mpesa, as I found out recently. I have mpesa with Vodacom in South Africa, and due to their mistake, I have to return to a store and re-verify my account and details, because they did not use a capital letter on my first and last name when capturing my details. So now my account is downgraded in features, because they made a mistake, and they insist that it can only be fixed if I return to a store with all my details to prove everything again. I have called customer service numerous times, and been in conversation with support on twitter, and there is nothing they can do, the only way is to waste my own time and go back to a store to prove everything again. Fuck that, they just lost a customer, I am sticking to bitcoin, sorry.

So test it...there are 16,362,825 bitcoins in existance, at a price of $2214.25 each. so test it yourself on your calculator: 16362825 x 2214.25 = 36231385256, which is exactly the market cap of bitcoin. NOW, look at Ethereum....look how many tokens there are at this moment: 92,085,216, multiply that by the price 228.43 = 21035025890 which just happens to be the market cap of Ethereum. In Crypto, tokens DO determine market cap, if not, then its one hell of a coincidence.

You can try to be a trader, by buying when you think the price will go up, and then when it does, you sell at a profit for example. Dont do this. If you are not an experienced trader, you will lose a lot of money fast. 
Many people buy a bitcoin at a time, and then sell it in smaller chunks to people who want small amounts, on places like localbitcoins.com at a profit. People are willing to pay a little more if they dont have, or cant get an account at a local exchange.
Some people open accounts on multiple exchanges, and then when there is a difference in price on the exchanges, they will buy on the cheaper exchange, and sell on the more expensive one, and keep the profit. 
Trust me, learn to just use bitcoin first, make a few small purchases, open a wallet at bitgo.com....maybe even install a wallet on your mobile phone and send a little bitcoin there so that you can spend it if you are out somewhere and see a place that accepts bitcoin. If you are going to try trading, expect to lose some money, even the best traders take losses.

As far as I know, the 'thin' clients that dont download the entire blockchain still check the blockchain for your bitcoin transactions. The 'server they use' is the blockchain, which is not going away. If I understand it properly, these clients only need to check the blockchain for the transactions connected to your wallet address, which is quick and easy for them to do.

If people accept paypal directly for bitcoin, they are taking a gigantic risk that you will just reverse the paypal payment, and keep the bitcoin.
If you want to buy bitcoin with paypal, use virwox. Here is a walk-through

You dont make money cloud mining with bitknock, they are more expensive than other cloud mining companies anyway. You make money by referring people and getting a cut off their referrals etc. It is a ponzi scheme hiding behind a cloud mining scheme, so double the risk. The bitcoin calculator on their site is also wrong and gives a false idea of profits.

why dont you download electrum or mycelium, then disconnect from the web and install each of them, you will see that you will be able to create a bitcoin wallet on both quite easily without accessing any servers. You will be able to make a backup of the private keys too, so that you can store those safely. To use each of them properly, you will need to reconnect to the web.

So if a bank for example does not use POW because they opt for a private 'blockchain', and a bunch of other banks use the same blockchain....what kind of consensus is there? I mean, if a hacker for exampale got into the bank system, or a disgruntled employee, and they created a transaction from the bank account to some offshore account. Surely the other banks would all just agree and carry on like normal....or if they wanted to roll back, I suppose that would be possible then?
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:44:09
Just buy bitcoin and hold it. You will have bitcoin instantly instead of waiting months and months. You will be able to ride the price wave because you already have bitcoin, not sit on the sidelines wishing you could mine faster. You will have the option to sell it instantly if the price is tanking and you want to stop losses, or sell to take in some profit. If you are cloud mining, your money is locked in for months and months before you eventually break even. (if you are lucky!). Only after you have broken even, after months or years of mining, will you be able to start making a profit....and because the profit gets less and less every 2 weeks, by the time that happens, you might be at zero profit already. Many cloud mining companies stop your account from mining when it becomes unprofitable, and many people lose money as they have not broken even by that point. Just do one thing, listen to me now....DONT CLOUDMINE!!! JUST BUY BITCOIN. Good luck!

virwox.com, deposit paypal, you will be limited for having a new account. Buy SLL on virwox, then use that to buy bitcoin, then withdraw. Expect 15%+ less bitcoin than using an exchange.
You could also try bitcoin-otc, but dont expect people to trust you with anything more than about $5 in paypal.
You can also try localbitcoins.com, and see if there are people there who will trade using paypal, but dont count on it. Paypal is reversible, bitcoin is not, so people dont want to deal that way generally.

Other factors can make the price of bitcoin go up or down in price, not how fast the hardware can be manufactured. There are many miners turned off right now because the price is low, and it is more profitable to just buy bitcoin...you would spend more money on electricity etc to mine the same amount of bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin goes up, many thousands of miners will suddenly be turned back on again, and the difficulty will adjust accordingly.

It depends if she already has bitcoin, and if the person she is sending to, is willing to accept bitcoin.  If the person is happy to accept bitcoin, then there is no issue that side. If she already has bitcoin, then she just needs to send the value equal to the amount of USD she is wanting to transfer to the other person and its super fast and cheap.
If the person she is sending to is not familiar with bitcoin, or does not want to accept it, then that is going to be a hurdle. If she wants to use bitcoin she might have to use a third party person or company on the Australian side to convert to local currency before it gets to the other person, which will be an additional cost. Depending on the amount she wants to send, there could be liquidity issues if she is sending large amounts of money.
If she doe not have bitcoin yet either, then that is going to be another hurdle...she will need to convert her money to bitcoin first, which will be at a cost, and depending on the amount of money, again, it could be an issue. She will need to decide on an exchange to use, and to also most likely go through the AML / KYC process and have a limited account in the beginning. If she is only wanting to send small amounts of money, this is not a big deal....

Just buy bitcoin with the money you want to buy the miner with, you will have more bitcoin than you will earn in years of mining, and you can trade the full amount at any time anyway, no electricity costs, shipping delays, hardware configuration delays or tweaking, no heat, no noise, no hardware failure ever, and no stress about breaking even. Just buy and hold, trust me.
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:06:34
Put it this way, the glory days are gone, unless the price moves in a big big way up, then they will temporarily be back...while the difficulty / bitcoin price / mining hardware and running cost price all catch up with each other. So bitcoin mining will most likely always be only profitable enough to keep some dedicated people and large mining companies with lower overheads / TH costs interested in mining, no matter what the price....there might be bouts of high or low profitability, but it wall always probably be within a certain low percentage range and during that time there will be people who constantly mine, and those who turn on or turn off with the profitability.

Nobody can predict a massive bitcoin dump, world event, or something that can dramatically affect the price of bitcoin one day in advance, never mind months in advance.

These CCTV America videos about bitcoin in South Africa keep showing up, I comment on them with information in Youtube, but for some reason my comments do not show when I am not logged in. Its as if they are blocking my comments and only I can see them?!?
They have all the facts WRONG, any business or person in South Africa can easily accept bitcoin, convert to Rand, and have it deposited into your SA bank account without exposing yourself to market valatility. This can be done for a 1.9% fee using PayFast, and has been available since July 2014.
The reporter says bitcoin was introduced late last year to South Africa, complete crap, we have been using it here for years, personally since 2011. The restaurant owner they talk to has no idea they can accept bitcoin and have Rand in their bank account, nor does the "expert" they use, or they would have said something about it.
Yes there is not a ton of places using it, but they still need to get their facts straight....and why do my comments not show on any of their videos when I am not logged into Youtube?

Adam Guerbuez has a lot of followers because he is one of those people we all love to hate. He is an Evil spammer. Facebook took him to court and a U.S. court fined him US$873 million. That is how he became 'famous', and got a ton of followers.  He was found guilty of sending out more than 4 million penis-enlargement, marijuana and pornographic spam messages via Facebook. It was the largest-ever award under the U.S.'s federal antispam law. Facebook said Guerbuez stole passwords through phishing attacks and used a botnet of hacked computers to access Facebook accounts without authorization. 
He is one of those kind of people who craves attention, and so everything he does is to get attention, and even wants people to make a movie about him and wants to write a book about his life. Look at every post or video he makes, its all about him and how clever he is, how kind he is etc. I think all the 'kind' things he does for the homeless is because of his guilty feelings from being associated with hate crimes and racism in the past. Just because he has a lot of twitter followers, does not make his predictions gold though, almost all his predictions are wrong when it comes to bitcoin.
If you follow him, you will soon realize everything he says is to get attention and does not come true....its nice that he tries to help homeless people sometimes, but it seems very much like its done for the ratings, comments and shares than out of the kindness of his heart, but only he will know that for sure.

These days mining is barely profitable if at all on a small scale, it was never designed to be super profitable to mine. If bitcoin is worth $10k one day, its very likely that it will still be the same. Miners wont be making a killing as it will cost them a lot more to mine in the future than it does now. If the price of bitcoin suddenly rocketed up, and the costs to mine it stayed the same, it would be very very profitable to mine. When that is happens, thousands of people start mining again, the difficulty goes up accordingly, and it becomes harder to mine bitcoin, and less profitable. Its a self regulating system.

Just use it anywhere that accepts bitcoin as an option, instead of using your credit card. Then replace what you have spent, so that you always have a some bitcoin available to spend. You dont get into debt for purchases, and have to pay interest on them, you only spend what you have, which is better.The vendor normally pays a fee to accept credit cards, so paying by bitcoin puts more money into their hands, and they dont have the risk of a chargeback, so sometimes they give a discount for using bitcoin.
Using your credit card is more risky, you could get your card cloned, your identity stolen, or more taken off than you expected at a later date for example, because you hand over the power to take money out of your account to a random stranger. How many times have big companies been hacked and all the user private details taken, and sold to the highest bidder....customer credit card numbers etc. You dont have that with bitcoin. With bitcoin you send the person money, they cant take it from you. Less invasion of privacy, just like in the movies when the police are looking for someone they look where their credit card has last been used, there is less chance of tracking.
Buy with credit card at circle.com, or find a bitcoin ATM near you to buy in cash

No, you normally cant by ANY foreign currency on credit card, bitcoin is just going by the same rules. There are ways around it, some places have the option, like circle.com if you link your bank accounts etc. 
I have previously posted twice about buying bitcoin with paypal or credit card using virwox, but you pay their charges. If you are happy to pay about 15 to 20% more than the going rate, then you can easily and quikly use their services. I have done it a few times when people have paid me by paypal because I dont have any way to withdraw paypal where I live.

The easiest way to buy I have found is with a credit card from CEX. If you have an unverified account, you will be limited to $400 a day. Verify your account and you will have the limit lifted. Withdraws of unverified accounts are something like $200 a day, again, verify and it will be lifted. Otherwise if you are trying to buy less than $400 a day, its awesome and easy with a credit card.

Accept bitcoin directly, then pay suppliers in bitcoin, exchange some of it to pay those who only take USD....you could use bitpay to do this easily and quickly. Get bitcoin addresses of your suppliers. You can set your bitcoin / USD ratio with bitpay, let them know how much to convert to USD, and how much to leave as bitcoin with each transaction. If 50% of your suppliers only take USD, then set that ratio with bitpay so that you can pay them with the currency they want, and the others with bitcoin

You generally dont make a profit because the difficulty increases in mining whittle away your profits until you are no longer making any. This generally happens very close to, or before your break even point, in which case you lose money. If luck is on your side and you manage to break even, its generally very little profit to take before it is no longer viable to continue mining. Most people would rather hold the bitcoin, and have the option to trade it, or use it whenever they want, rather than to give it to a 3rd party to have it slowly trickle back over many months, with the chance of not getting it all back.

you will probably make more money buying now when the price is low, and holding. Mining was never supposed to be ultra profitable, just profitable enough to keep the incentive there. In the early days when the difficulty was lower, it was very profitable, those days are gone. Even with a lot of money to spend on it, you are still gambling two times as much as if you just bought bitcoin. Once because you might not make enough bitcoin to justify the cost, and twice because the price of bitcoin could drop and wipe out what little profit you have made.

@_date: 2016-07-29 16:21:00
the general gist of it is that want bigger blocks now, and want bigger blocks too one day, when the core devs decide to do it. Which is probably years away.
both subs have a portion of users who dislike the other sub and will jump at any way they can to bring them down, mock, discredit etc. Both are guilty of this, and both accuse the other of it and act innocent. Like kids. Even the people in charge of both subs are guilty.
Both say they want what is best for bitcoin, but they disagree on what that is.
Of course, a major point is the block size, and why changing the size to 2mb has not already been done, wont be done anytime soon, how it is affecting bitcoin, who is benefiting from smaller blocks, other updates that release the pressure of full blocks and fix other issues, but still dont increase the size, to name a few.
Throw in some conspiracy theories about why people may or may not want to keep blocks small, core devs being on the payroll of certain companies and those companies reasons for doing things. Add a bit of censorship in the subs, troll posts, shadow banning, voting manipulation, moderators who may or may not have been involved in shady activity, and it turns into a complete soap opera.
Given enough time, all the differences will fall away if there is timely progress on the main blocksize issue....how much time, only god knows. Thats the way I see it anyway.

Sorry to be a pain, can you please link me to somewhere I can read a simple explanation of how this is done.
I cant figure out then what segwit2x is proposing to then, if the size has been increased to 4mb with segwit, are they wanting to downgrade it to 2mb with 2x version? I think the increase you are talking about is what most of the unlimited / segwit2x supporters dont 'get', and myself included. People see 1mb blocksize and want a bigger blocksize, you say segwit does this, but then why the need to change to 2mb blocksize if this is already done? I cant be alone in this confusion...

@_date: 2019-05-28 07:44:33
What would happen is if you send BTC, your bitcoin would arrive in the native segwit bitcoin address. 
Any address can always send to any address....it only depends on your wallet software that you are using if you can send or not. In the old days you could send to any address, even one that you made up, or even one with one digit. Wallets were made that try to prevent users from sending to addresses that might be invalid. If you have an older wallet, it might think a native Segwit address is an invalid address, or if its a really old wallet, it wont care and will just send. Your wallet software will be the thing that allows you to send or not. If it does not, just use better software.
This is an example of a made up address that people have sent bitcoin to: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE
It is a valid address, but nobody has the private key, it is made up.

If you have the fiat, just buy the bitcoin to the value of how much you want to invest. If you have the btc, just hold it, dont introduce more risk. If you are holding, you already have the bitcoin that will take you months to mine back if you manage to break even. You will immediately benefit from the price increases, and if it is tanking, you can sell to stop losses. When you start mining your funds are held hostage, and you might not ever break even, let alone profit. If you dont know what you are doing, you will probably lose money. Asking about cloud mining makes me think you dont know what you are doing. Only consider buying an S9 if you have really cheap / free electricity, otherwise you might be just throwing money away.

@_date: 2013-12-01 20:11:49
Thats the same graph that made the rounds when it peaked at 266...still went way higher after and will go higher again
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:09:52
Banks can ban all they want, the technology now in the public domain, bitcoin is here to stay, if people want to they can always do cash outs privately without banks. Prices have fallen fast many times before, relax, it will go up again
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:34:43
its an exchange, you can set your own buy or sell price and wait for your order to be filled. Or go visit one of the bitcoin ATMs with some cash
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:00:55
its a pleasure 
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:31:25
you dont sell your coins, rookie mistake
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:58:22
There have been lots of price spikes and dips over the years...always goes up in the end. Personally I am getting ready to buy more :)

Get a EUR debit card from Coinsbank.com
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:59:56
Works every time there is a price shakedown :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:56:53
Long term, you gonna be laughing all the way to the bank, hold on to your bitcoins or spend them, just dont sell them
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:52:46
It is already running, and it will never be completed, that is like asking when the internet will be complete. There is no completion date, it is never ending. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 14:01:06
almost every day there is a complaint, why do people still use them if they are so bad?
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:28:12
I am still waiting on 8 bitcoins that I tried to transfer out, its been 3 days so far and still they are 'processing'. My support tickets are also unanswered.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:40:02
It already has much more tokens, so it's only a matter of time since bitcoin is capped at 21mil 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:57:14
If it does i'll buy more :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:35:01
Where I am we have had these problems too. I suggest you ask the guy to send a scan of his ID or passport, with the same name etc as a scan of his bank account details, a utility bill or similar.
I have had the problem before where a person says they do an electronic transfer, and I check my bank and money has been deposited. I get a confirmation email from the bank transfer from customer. The confirmation email is actually a fake, and the deposit is a stolen cheque. You assume its an electronic deposit because of the fake email confirmation. 
The cheque bounces or does not clear, and the money is no longer in your account.
Call your bank to verify the transfer.

Low of maybe $400 over the next few days easily....high over the next few years....mmmm 3K-ish? Now is a good time to buy if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:56:35
Or get ready to buy more!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:53:22
dont worry, it will go up again, like many price shakedowns before
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:41:11
Yep, I agree, am getting ready for buying spree
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:39:18
if you dont see the transaction there when checking the address, then its possible Bitfinex could just be slow at processing it
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:13:47
yep thats true
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:31:21
What if you are not in the U.S. and dont give a shit about U.S. Federal regulation? Would this then only apply to U.S. citezens? good luck guys :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:43:50
its not correct, they made a mistake
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:11:11
If that site was legit then all the winnings and losses would be showing for that address in the blockchain, which it does not.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:59:18
THAT is a great idea :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:10:56
Its probably actually a great time to be charging in bitcoin, you can get more bitcoin for your $$$, so having some specials for your products and services if you accept bitcoin as a payment method can be quite lucrative in the long run right now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:49:35
Investors are in it for the long run and can see the potential for huge profits. Dreams of being able to buy cheap bitcoin are being realized, people who were unable to afford to buy much bitcoin are celebrating. People who charge in bitcoin and believe in the technology are happy to get more bitcoins for the same $ value, they know in the long run the value will increase. Bitcoin is so much more than a 'virtual currency', so so much more.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:54:44
cool :)
Just dont panic and sell them off too soon, hold on to them for a while, you wont be sorry
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:01:10
Thats the truth
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:16:12

I am not in the US, and am a citizen of a different country, but I can say that the rest of the world is laughing at all the US regulations while we take advantage of this opportunity. Trust me, the US will eventually join the party, sooner or later....but before that happens, the regulations are just hurting your own interests and the citizens of the US who are legitimate people trying to make a living by the book. There is more illegal activity and money laundering using USD than any other currency in the world, and that is a FACT! 
The US needs to stop the hating and join in, get a foot in the door before while they can. In the meantime, I am very grateful that I am not a US citizen, and I can legitimately transact virtually instantly with anyone I choose, whenever I choose. 
You cant honestly say you personally enjoy the pitfalls of the US banking system, i mean really.....a supposedly first world country is light years behind many 3rd world countries who have no issues at all with bitcoin.

Makes sense, thanks :)
