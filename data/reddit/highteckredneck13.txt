I think a lot of people waited until the new year to sell for tax reasons.  If you sell in Jan, you don't have to pay the Gov't capital gains until at least 15 months later.  It's like an interest free loan.

Any chance you could narrow down this timeline?  I've been looking at your previous posts and it looks like this has been a month away for over a year :(

I won't be using the website again, I transferred some LTC in to convert to BTC.  It was stuck on verifying for about 3 days,  I sent in a support ticket that they never did reply too, they just finally showed up in my wallet.

This is going too far the other way.  I would much rather see the switch to mBtc than uBtc.

Does everyone that posts in this thread get reddit gold, wow that's a lot of stars.  I might just have to buy some and add to the madness!

I believe the word you are looking for is "BUY"

Credit cards make money from people having debt, you need money to use bitcoin!
