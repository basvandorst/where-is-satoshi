The funniest part about this is that Bitcoin Cash adopted BIP 143 for sighash, which is the signature algorithm adopted for segwit.  Why?  Well, BIP 143 is a more efficient signature which relieves the quadratic hashing problem.

You don't need the blockchain history to be downloaded.  Just need the wallet file.  Open it and identify which address the coins were in during the fork.  You can read up with a few google searches on how to extract your private key depending on the wallet you were using.  That's all that coinomi needs to import for you BCH.
PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL BTC HAS BEEN MOVED OUT OF THAT ADDRESS TO A NEW BTC ADDRESS FIRST!
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:11:49
Two risks off the top of my head:
1 - your private keys could be exposed and your BTC could be stolen if the import wallet is compromosed.
2 - If replay protection is not properly implemented in a forked coin being imported, your BTC could also move out with your transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:47:47
It won't show up there.  You need to claim the BCH using the private key of the address where you sent your bitcoin.  You can use a wallet like coinomi to import your forked coin (and sell for more BTC)

@_date: 2017-12-25 16:41:12
You don't understand bitcoin it seems.  You do not pay anyone for "access".  You pay the decentralized network for securing your transaction.  You can think of SegWit as a more efficient way to do this, hence the lower fee. 
What you are calling the middleman, is actually the foundation of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:53:17
The majority of transactions are from some big exchanges (like coinbase/gdax) which have not implemented segwit.  Until they do - the blockchain will continue to be stressed.
Also, the Bitcoin Core client does not yet implement segwit by default.  Development has been on priorities elsewhere, but we should see segwit in the Core client by March at the latest - this is the reference implementation that the exchanges may need to get Segwit running.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:34:56
Not offence, but judging from your comment, you don't understand what a market is.  Someone else is willing to pay the fees, you obviously are not.  The person willing to pay the fees gets the tx.
Until SW is adopted and LN deployed, this is where we sit.  If you want to increase capacity and scale, then encourage your wallet/exchange to use SegWit transactions.

The fees are actually protecting the network.  Fees make attacks expensive so that they can't be sustained.  Increasing the blocksize means that a larger attack can be launched for the same price.

Honestly, I don't think most users know how to use segwit.  The Bitcoin Core wallet doesn't even use it (if using the GUI).  
If your address does not start with a 3 then you are not using SegWit.
Just using a wallet which supports SegWit is not enough, sometimes you need to select it.  In Armory, for example, you need to be in Expert Mode, and set P2SH-P2WPKH to use SegWit.  I'm not sure about other wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:15:54
I hope that wallet is secure.  Lots of recent donations.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:38:45
All I have to say:
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:04:02
Wallets (and exchanges) claim they support SegWit, few actually do use it.  I've been using SegWit since it came out.
Most people think that if they use a wallet with SegWit support, they are using segwit.  not true.  You often have to do some expert configuration to actually make SegWit transactions.  You need to enable P2SH-P2WPKH addresses (usually through the debug console, or expert mode).
Same with exchanges.  Gemini says they support SegWit, but all of their deposit addresses are non-SegWit.  I withdraw from them to a SegWit address, but that's the extent of their "support".  Internally, they are not using SegWit yet.
I would like to write a guide for dummies on the subject, but I think there's still lots of opposition to adoption for some reason.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:52:28
Use Gemini - they also have free sends out.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:50:47
Sounds like you're new here.  Welcome.
First - the wallet provides an address, not a txid (transaction id).  A txid is assigned to a movement of coins to and from addresses.  
Secondly, you can have different types of wallets.  If you have a wallet which is a "full" client, you need to download and verify the entire bitcoin blockchain before your coins show up.  This is how the Bitcoin Core wallet works.
Other wallets, rely on a trusted server to check if you have the coins or not using your public address (keeping the private keys secret/encrypted).  If you are using a wallet like Electrum, this is how it works.
I do not have tor, so I can't check your link.  If you put your public address here, we can see if you own the bitcoins or not.
NEVER EVER put your private key or password somewhere public.  You can divulge your public address at the cost of connecting you to that address, but your bitcoins can't be moved without your private key (which only you have).
Finally - if you see that your address has the coins in it using a block explorer, your coins should be safe provided you have the private key in your wallet.
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:23:46
51% attack is not hacking.  Again - mining has nothing to do with hacking, it's purely about confirming transactions.  A 51% attack on transaction confirmation to rewrite the blockchain over enough blocks as to split the chain in the attackers favor is not hacking.  Statistically, you also do not need even 50% to pull it off.  I have no idea where the costs come from in that website.  Even assuming the generation of 25EH is possible, $476K for 25EH over 1 hour is \~ 6 blocks would be 75 BTC of block reward, which at today's price is worth over $480K.  According to that math, a 51% attack is essentially free at "market price".  Sorry - that doesn't pass the sanity check.
The cost is MUCH MUCH higher.
Again - the energy cost of Bitcoin does not increase with the scale of transactions, nor the price of Bitcoin.  All that is needed is enough energy + mining power to prevent A SINGLE BAD ACTOR from launching an attack.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:39:15
What you can do immediately is use SegWit for transactions (everyone should).  If the address doesn't start with a 3 you are not using segwit (Even if your wallet supports it).
Longer term - Lightening.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:42
Well, that's what gdax does for sure (and I think some others as well).  I don't understand why, but that's what they do.
EDIT: I traced back one of my withdraws to this transaction on GDAX: 
This is what they're doing.  If you follow any of those equal sized addresses, you can see how much users are withdrawing.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:18:44
Correct - not much help (but one more layer of defence).  I would try to install the linux version of the wallet on a vm myself if my host was a windows machine.  I think (not sure) that some simple malware can be blocked this way, but you probably aren't immune to more advanced malware.

Did the Ledger address start with a 3?  If it started with a 1, then it was not a SegWit transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:30:06
I'm not convinced.  I hypothesize that the price of miners would just come down, but hash rate would continue to go up.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:27:52
Gemini doesn't generate SegWit deposit addresses.  They do however support withdraw to a SegWit address.  
Since I'm using SegWit addresses on my wallet, I've been routing my purchases from Coinbase to Gdax to Gemini, and then to my wallet.  The exchanges pay the fees.  (I do feel a little bad about adding this "spam" to the blockchain, but Gdax doesn't support SegWit)
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:25:26
WTF are you talking about?  Segwit is backwards compatible.  You just need to start using it to get the advantages.  If you don't upgrade, you are free to continue on and keep paying those higher fees.
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:07:14
No you can't.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:56:12
No, it does not mean you don't pay fees, but you pay lower fees.  
More importantly, if everyone did this, all fees would go down alot (maybe back to pennies).  The problem is that 90% of transactions are not SegWit.  If they were SegWit, we would have 2.1 times the transaction capacity in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:20:56

That looks like an exchange wallet.  They split larger addresses into smaller addresses like that before sending out from the small wallets to individuals.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:58:02
This is a coinbase (gdax) hot wallet.  Follow the addresses on the outputs (right) and start adding up the number of transactions they are putting on the chain.
All non-segwit, and all very small transactions after the batch.  
@_date: 2018-09-11 22:28:03
Yes.  Start a lightning node.  Advertise your pub\_key and connection details.  Someone can do a push transaction channel open and send you BTC.  This will be part of the on-chain establishment of the channel, which then will stay open for future off-chain transactions to you, and you can also spend BTC back on that channel over LN.

I'm not trying to be overly aggressive in my response, but I want to be absolutely clear in my statement.  I see no evidence to support what you are saying.  I see only evidence in contrary.  Your statements are hearsay and speculation.


That is absolutely incorrect.  The hash power of miners only needs to be sufficient to withstand the strength of a single attacker.  It has nothing to do with how popular Bitcoin is.  Mining has NOTHING to do with hacking, and hacking has NOTHING to do with energy use.  The only concern is the resource requirement to launch an attack, which is already extremely high.  At the very least, a large attack attempt is detectable, and the Bitcoin network would respond (people stop transacting, counter by launching more distributed miners to compensate - self interest, etc.)  It is unlikely even a state-sponsored actor could successfully attack Bitcoin at this point.

LN closes discretized to 1 sat.  There is a rounding that happens to 1 sat when you close the channel and xmit to the blockchain.  I'm not sure how it decides the rounding - IIRC, it is a probabilistic determination.  I.e. if you had 0.01 sat balance, there is a 1/100 chance you would get the Satoshi, and 99/100 the other party would. 
Maybe someone else can confirm how it's decided.

I can't support the redistribution of coin ownership.  Nobody knows for certain which are Satoshi's coins - We can only guess from things like the nonce used early on, but it's still a good guess.  Unless Satoshi signed a message with those keys, nobody knows.

What a great dream.  Millions of people opening channels.  If only that was going to actually happen that way.

Maybe, but more likely, they have $100,000 they want to send, and are willing to pay $50 to send it.  In terms of space in the blockchain, your transaction, and the 100K transaction are equivalent.  The difference is that the other user is willing to pay more to get his transaction into the blockchain.  
Is it fair?  Well, it's a free market, so unless you want someone reducing the rights for the person transferring 100K, it is fair.
@_date: 2018-09-12 10:58:48
If you get your node up, post your connection info here and I'll open a channel to you and send you 1000 Satoshi while opening a channel with 100K satoshi capacity.  If you keep the channel announcement public, I'll post the channel info from [1ml.com](

Your argument is not convincing.  Hashrate is not correlated with price.  If that was the case, the hashrate would decrease when the price decreases.  This is not what we see in real life.
You can see on this chart, that even when price falls, hashrate goes up.  Also note that post-2014, the large increases in price do not change the rate at which hashrate goes up.
**The energy usage of Bitcoin is NOT coupled with the price, and NOT coupled with the transaction rate.**

I see two scenarios which could allow them to move these coins:
1 - The rate of blockchain transaction decreases enough that fees drastically fall.  This could be done through segwit adoption, or transactions moving to Lightening
2 - The blocksize is increased to allow more transactions to be fit into blocks resulting in a reduction of fees.  This could happen after Lightning is deployed.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:44:46
Yes, there was drop in usage, but it's hard to measure exactly how much "usage" went down, since usage =/= transaction count =/= mempool size.
total # of transactions definitely went down.
batching went from about 2% to about 10% of transactions in 3-4 outputs during the period (i.e. 2x the utxo transfer per transaction).  Which would also relive stress on the mempool.
Additionally, Segwit adoption has reduced the size of transactions at that time:

Software is hard.  Bugs happen.  Mistakes happen.  Things get overlooked.  A flaw in their wallet is the simplest explanation.
Occam's Razor would hold that your hypothesis is unlikely to be true.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:20:08
Actually, the Mt.Gox wallet is split like this to enable large volumes of transactions without holding up the wallet waiting for change transactions for the next withdraw.  This is probably also so that each customer withdrawing does not easily get information about all the other customers withdrawing.

There is no fix to malleable Tx's in any code.  Only a workaround.  They are just as susceptible as anyone else.  I'm not talking about human operators btw.  Never thought nor suggested such a thing.  I'm talking about automated systems.  Not all txs will be affected by tx malleability.

I trade hundreds of thousands on Kraken.  I also don't keep my entire balance on their exchange!  That would be a risky thing to do - you should keep the bulk of your balance on your own wallet, where you have the private keys - otherwise you don't own them.  
To do this, you have to often deposit and withdraw bitcoins to follow the market.  In this case, the fees do add up (for their benefit).
I don't care if they are keeping any difference in the fees, but I wish they were transparent about it.  For example, it is clear that they take the trade fees.
Don't get me wrong, I think they are a decent exchange and I do the bulk of my trading there.

Ok, so you have problem with the value of debt then?  
 shows the USD M1 Multiplier.  
 shows the monetary base.  
 shows the M1 velocity.  " it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. "  
Here is what I want to make clear.  The monetary base has become very very large in recent years (creation of money).  The M1 multiplier measures the maximum amount of commercial bank money that can be created by a given unit of central bank money.  
**IMPORTANT** In other words: for each dollar of money "created" by the fed, the fractional reserve system can create the M1 amount by lending out deposits.  You can see that since 2008, the M1 multiplier is less than one.  This means, in combination with my next points, that for every dollar the fed creates, the GDP will decrease.  
The fed is printing money like MAD.  See the monetary base graph.  The reason the fed has to do this is to prevent the commercial banks from holding all their deposits as reserves and then not giving out loans (this is what happened in the 1930s).  The fed believes that by printing massive amounts of money, it incentives the commercial banks to offer more loans (yes it does -&gt; more debt).  
**The nail in the coffin:**  The final graph shows the velocity of money.  It is decreasing.  This means that people are not spending money, nor trading within the economy.  It is a view on the ability to create GDP.  The creation of this debt is NOT increasing GDP.  Not only is the M1 multiplier below 1 (for the first time in history), but also, the fed is printing money, which is resulting in reduction of GDP ==&gt; DESTRUCTION OF WEALTH.
Please explain how this is not bad.
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:02:30
Creation of new money != creation of wealth.  In fact, it dilutes the wealth of others since the creation of new money == creation of debt.  It's a "hope" that this new debt creates wealth.  And sometimes it does.  However, if you look at the current USD M1 multiplier, in combination with the velocity of money.  You can see that it is measured now that the creation of new debt today is actually DECREASING WEALTH.  That's right.  For every dollar (debt) created, wealth is being destroyed.  Here is where the current economic system is out-right failing.  This is why the world needs a currency built on solid fundamentals.  Welcome Bitcoin.

You can't just say "this line is invalid"  That's not how it works.  
Mt.Gox has the private keys for those bitcoins the users "deposited".  It's just like when you transfer money with a bank electronically.  The money doesn't move, just "data".  Does that mean when you check your bank account you don't really have the money - NO.  it is a valid deposit in any case.  
The point is that Mt.Gox was OBLIGATED to hold all money and bitcoins **in the member's names** by their own terms.  They breached those terms.  You are already wrong when you said they *own* the data.  Even by their own terms, they don't own the bitcoins (i.e. private keys).  They can't liquidate that which they don't own.


Just like your bank account is an internal ledger.  If you deposit a $100 bill, you don't get the same $100 bill back.  So what.

No.  This is not laid out in the TOS.  Show me.  On the contrary the terms of service state that:


* it will use all reasonable care and skill in facilitating the matching of offers of the Members on the Site via the Platform to conclude Transactions.
* all purchase and sale offers, as well as Bitcoin Purchase Transactions, made on the Platform, will be managed in an anonymous manner so that Buyers and Sellers will not know each other.
* the Transaction Price is calculated on the basis of actual matched offers made by Buyers and Sellers participating in the bidding process on the Platform combined with the applicable Commission.
* once offers to buy or sell Bitcoins are matched, such offers may not be withdrawn.
* Transfer of Bitcoins in a Transfer Transaction may not be withdrawn.
* **it will hold all monetary sums and all Bitcoins deposited by each Member in its Account, in that Member's name as registered in their Account details, and on such Member's behalf.**
* it shall comply with any and all laws and regulations relating to offering the Platform.


It seems pretty clear to me that MT.GOX had, in their terms that Mt.Gox will hold all "monetary sums and all Bitcoins deposited by each Member in its Account, in that Member's name as registered in their Account details, and on such Member's behalf".  Furthermore, **Mt. Gox is liable for all damages** since there is a "loss suffered is caused by a breach of these Terms by Mt. Gox".
Point is that they are holding in on the Member's behalf!  i.e. they do not own the bitcoins

I agree with on this.  The transaction malleability would be a difficult stream to steal coins.  However, it is possible this was used with some success by attackers.  It is unlikely that random people would have been "leaked" these coins.  However, an attack vector did exist.
Your explanation of the malleability issue is afaik incorrect as well. 


They were not creating "fixable" transactions per se, but they were including inputs which were already spent.  There was no "fixing" going on by other entities.  These transactions were not accepted in the blockchain because they included inputs that went through on a previous transaction which had the txid mutated (inconvenient, but harmless if accounted for).  
The **real attack** is to note that this Txid mutation was possibly intentionally done by a connected attacker who would be initiating withdraws from Gox and then using some way to identify only HIS transaction - and mutating those (possibly using a unique total of bitcoins like 123.45678).
so the steps are:
1) Initiate a withdraw from Gox for a total of 123.456789 BTC.
2) Using a custom network client(s), get connected to Gox's IPs transmitting (or get close).
3) Watch for a transaction of 123.456789 BTC and mutate the txid, then re-transmit on the network.
4) Mutated Transaction is confirmed in the blockchain, and coins are in attackers wallet.
5) Gox does not see the original txid in the blockchain, wait 2 hours and re-issues the transaction automatically.
6) We are back step 3, and repeat ad infinitum.
Attacker would be getting the 123.456789 BTC every 2 hours until no valid inputs could be sent by Gox.
This is IMO the more likely scenario.

1 - it's about proof and it's about control.  Bitcoin gives you both.  Welcome to public key cryptography.
2 - LN nodes do not validate transactions.  You do not understand how LN works.  LN nodes don't even know the recipient of the transaction.  Welcome to onion routing.
3 - the bitcoin mainnet can undergo a 51 attack?  this is extremely unlikely and prohibitively expensive.  
4 - convert to fiat?  Not in the future when BTC is the standard currency.  I accept payments in fiat for all of my services.  The problem is tax law, which sucks.  Still, some governments are starting to accept crypto for taxes so there is progress being made.
5 - someone can take my money?  Ok, I challenge you to take my BTC.  I'll wait while you let me know once you're done.
6 - Bitcoin has all of the advantages. It is visionary.  The world just hasn't caught up yet.  The best features of Bitcoin are also yet to come.
Fiat will not stand the test of time.  The longest running fiat currency is the British Pound (1931), and it is only 89 years old.  Most fiat currencies fail after 27 years.  Let's see where Bitcoin is in another 20 years.

No, it's not really a "financial term".  Just like how you don't say physical movie when discussing streaming video.  
It's a mash of concepts - physical goods versus virtual goods.  The mix-up comes in when realizing Bitcoin is just the first virtual good which is not infinitely replicable (a typical characteristic of a physical good).  The irreplicability characteristic is the same, but the difference is that it is still a virtual good and not physical good.
Typically, financial derivatives like futures contracts are built on physical goods. It's just unusual that when discussing futures contracts, we have a virtual good.  A funny mix-up IMO (ok, my sense of humor may be a bit odd).

e-transfers are not even the same thing.  They are not settled for weeks later, they are reversable, plus it's just numbers in a database, so not even "really" your money until you withdraw (and the bank gives you permission).  
BTC transfers on LN are nearly instant and settled on L2, with cryptographic proof, and can also be free.

It looks like BitGo uses a dynamic algorithm that tries to set the fees to get your transaction confirmed quickly.  Looks at first glance like they don't have any options to set a lower fee :(  
Maybe try again at a later date when the dynamic algorithm may be set to a lower fee when there are fewer transactions going on?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:16:18
Just in case :)
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:07:06
There are no mandatory fees.  You should be able to set the fee to any value you want.  The main effect of the fee is in how fast the transaction makes it into the block chain.  If the network is really busy, you may need a higher fee to get your transaction in.  I don't recommend a 0 fee, but pay something at a minimum if you're not in a rush to make the transaction.

You may have the private key in the wrong format.  Does it start with a 5 or with a K or L ?  It should be WIF compressed for a segwit address.  If it starts with 5, then you need to convert your private key.  Please do not use an online service to do this.

@_date: 2019-10-15 21:19:25
In my prediction, AMP will likely create (at least) two changes in LN:
1- AMP will make LN suitable for payments of any size, not just small transactions.  Since payments will be aggregated over many channels, we can think of LN for buying cars and houses - not just coffee.
2 - AMP will make LN even more peer to peer through the democratization of node liquidity.  Currently, small capacity nodes/channels are excluded from large payments since they do not have the capacity to execute payment in a single atomic action.  With AMP, it will enable more small nodes to participate in routing and incintivize more people to run nodes, even if they do not have much BTC.
And thanks for the Zapread plug ;). I really need more time or volunteers to improve it faster!  We need to fix social media!

Reading and understanding chapter 4 and 6 in Mastering Bitcoin may be helpful to understand this in detail:  [  [ 
1) the owner private key is used to derive the public key (1 way function).
2) The bitcoin address is derived from the owner public key.  The (very early) original bitcoin transaction were called Pay to Public Key (P2PK) but these are not used anymore.  A more secure form is used called Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH).  These are the addresses you see which start with 1.  There are new addresses since then which include scripts, and of course segwit - but the basics are pretty much the same.  
3) The address is described by an unlocking script such that the public key, hashed, must equal the address and the signature must match the public key.
With that background:
Owner 1 sends Bitcoin to Owner 2.  Owner 1 takes Owner 2 public key hash (BTC address), and combines the owner 1 public key with a signature of the transaction to owner2 pubkeyhash with owner 1 private key - this describes a transaction which says that the Bitcoin now belongs to owner 2.  The entire thing is described as the script signature.   
 The verification step is simply the comparison of the signature matching the public key. Read this part to see how the transaction is created:   [ 
In that section, you can see explained that the digital signature created using the private key is used to validate the spending of the coins in that address (public key derived) without giving away the private key (through the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm).
You can see that the public key and the signature are provided in the transaction scriptsig encoding in order to spend the coins.
Hope that helps!

Very cool feature.
It's somewhat reminiscent of the Bitcoin deprecated IP Payment feature removed in core 0.8.0, except it solves the identity problem.
See [ for a discussion on why Bitcoin removed the pay to IP feature.
With sphinx, you can ensure that the payment is cryptographic-ally proven to be the recipient you intended through their node pub key.  The pay to IP feature was vulnerable since the BTC address was generated on request and an attacker could provide their address through MITM, which can't be validated to belong to the intended recipient.  
For privacy in BTC, on-chain transactions would be to a new address every time - so a new address would be required.  However, since LN has onion routed payments, both privacy can be preserved and the recipient validated to provide the same general feature pay to IP provided.  It's quite remarkable actually.

While blockchain fees are increasing with transaction volume, LN fees will be decreasing with transaction volume.  This is because nodes want to attract routing to collect more of the (miniscule) fees.  It's a totally different fee market.

Why do you say that?  You can have just two channels open and transact back and forth between the two at high volume (if you are chosen as a part of many routes).
I think what you're trying to say is that if you open more channels, you are more likely to be in the path of transactions.  The ability "to handle that traffic" has little to do with the number of channels you have open.

That would most likely be a change address.  If you received .20 bitcoins, you can't just send .01 bitcoins of it, you have to send it all to one or more addresses.  So what you do is create a new address (or use an existing one) that you own and send 0.01 to where you want, and 0.19 to your change address. 
Inputs -&gt; Outputs.
0.20 -&gt; 0.01 + 0.19 - fee
You still own the 0.19.
* Similarily, if you buy 0.01 from an exchange, they will use an address to send you 0.01 and the rest back to their change address.

This doesn't sound right.  Bitcoin Core doesn't use a passphrase in it's wallet.
Even with the 12 word phrase, there is a possibility that there could be a 13th word (kept secret) which is required to access the funds.
In any case, if you have a seed phrase, keep that very safe.  Do not show anyone.

Ok, so I took your advice and I'm working on a web interface :)
I've registered  and now to write an interface.  Since my code is all in C I've decided to develop as an ASP page, but my core API will be useable from any language anyways.
I am using the language I know best (I am not a programmer by training) so It's windows.
In all, I will have two products: a windows application client, and a web client.  Web client for the masses, and the application for high speed trading (I can't bog down the server CPU).
In other good news, I will open source my multi-platform API and leave only my personal trading algorithms closed source.  If someone wants a cross-platform client application, they will be able to write one (I don't have the time)
Thanks for the tips :)

Gold is NOT stored conveniently.  Do you realize how expensive it is to store gold?  Safes / Security / buildings / Space.  It is VERY expensive to store.


YOUR BTC will never be destroyed as long as even one other computer in the world is still running the bitcoin client.  Your money is stored in the distributed database that makes bitcoin work.  The only way for you to lose this money is to lose your private keys which unlock your ability to spend your BTC.  Luckily, you can back up and password protect your private keys (wallet).  Best of all, this is free/cheap.  If you lose your computer, you don't have to worry since you have an off-site backup.  It's the same reason most people keep their fiat money in a bank, and not under their mattress.

I matters for scaling Bitcoin (both in transaction and value).  
1) transaction:  You can have as many transactions as you want over LN, with minimal or no fees.  
2) If 1 BTC trades at $1,000,000 then that 1 sat transaction has to be possible with reasonable fees.
The possibilities of this are wide and varied:
For example, this opens up the possibility of micropayments for anything.  You could pay for services in real-time even in 1 Satoshi increments.  It would lead to fair billing and improved efficiency everywhere.  Imagine if you were billed electricity use in real-time.  You could see how much that extra dry setting on your clothes drier costs directly.  These types of things have not been possible due to the crippling fees that our current financial systems use.

Hello, I am the owner of the website.  I've noticed a few others reporting this.  I'm using lnd on the back-end to run the service - the errors are reported by lnd.
The FeeInsufficient error happens if the channel you have open (or along the route) has too low of a capacity.  The network requires that not all capacity be spent on a channel in order to pay the on-chain transaction fee to close the channel.  If you don't have a channel open to you with enough capacity on the remote end, then you can't receive LN transactions yet.  Typically, I expect that after you've spent via a channel, you can afterwords receive via that channel (depending on the state of the network for intermediate hops between nodes).
Feel free to message me if you have any specific bugs to report.  I'm still developing the service and adding new features :)
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:56:24
I suspect it's because you need to keep a reserve in the channel for the partner that pays the blockchain network fee to close the channel in the future (if not left to expire).  I'm not sure how this is agreed to between channel partners on who pays the fee.  
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:35:15
That's partially true.  Every user doesn't have to be online "24/7", but you do have to be online to receive payments (for now).  Although, there is development to mitigate this drawback.  There is always a fallback to blockchain payment if the user is offline.
But **so what**: think about most applications for how LN would be used.  For merchant payments, how would the merchant know that a payment has been made if they are not online?  They have to be online anyway to check for payment and then fulfill orders.  For direct user payments, the same is true.
The use case of sending coins to a paper wallet, well, that is not what LN is for.  LN is for **scaling Bitcoin**.  That means that transactions for coffees, merchandise, services, etc. can live on LN, and the Blockhain is still there to secure it all.
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:54:22
Visa and master card servers have to be online.  That's the point.   I am not wrong.  Also - the website server has to be online and be notified of Visa payment.  It all has to be online.  Your coffee shop POS terminal has to be online, etc. etc.

There is a limited supply of gold.  It is not easy to acquire.  At first, you could go down to your local riverbed and pan for it.  Now, you need industrial level extraction techniques.  Sound familiar to bitcoin mining yet?  You are wrong.  Gold is rare, and it is deflationary.  It is just not used as currency anymore.  It has very little "intrinsic" value (if there is such a thing).  The vast majority of it is not used for jewelry or industry, it is just stored as bricks.  It is bought on markets not because people want to use it, but because people want to horde it.  If it was so easy to acquire more gold as you suggest, then it would not be worth as much as it is.

3) click the continue reading button and you will be presented with an "invoice" to pay 1 cent.
4) Open up  and paste the invoice in the "Take from jar" section.  Pay it.
If you go back the the article, it should be paid and visible.  Bonus points for having both windows on screen at the same time just so you can see how fast it is :)
Once the payment is made, the transaction is done, cryptographically secured, confirmation received.

@_date: 2018-04-26 20:15:05
yes, they keep getting fees, but no more *block reward* in the coinbase transaction (new coins).
The fees don't need to go up.  It all depends on the demand.  With 2nd layer transactions, transactions can happen off-chain, and only infrequently backed up by an on-chain transaction.  Mining will be less profitable, but that's ok.  The total hashrate only has to be 2x what any attacker can generate.
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:07:15
Ah - I didn't understand you.  
There is no low ceiling like the post suggested - point 3 is just not true.  
The ceiling will be high enough for daily transactions once LN matures - moreso when AMP rolls out.  There will also be always a blockchain fall-back for extra-large transactions.  
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:15:04


yes that would work, but you would pay for it with miner fees.  The proper use case is that you don't need to close the channel.  You can use the channel many times (sending and receiving).
Even if you open just a 20000 sat channel, you can do millions of 1 sat transactions through that channel (back and forth).

@_date: 2018-04-26 20:29:00
There will at some point in the future be other layers added which will also affect the cost of a transaction.  
A technology like Schnorr signatures will greatly compress the block size, and allow many more transactions per MB than currently possible.  Basically, you need only one "merged" signature for the entire block instead of a signature for each transaction.
Also, we may see a blocksize increase in the future once the demand will actually need it (i.e. usability limits).  
And if we're talking really far into the future: Also possible is that the block confirmation could switch to something other than proof of work.  This would then allow the blockchain to be secured without the need for expensive computation and energy.
There are many avenues of technological advancement possible. 
@_date: 2011-07-06 11:15:26

You can see at the link, I paid 0 fees (since there was a direct channel already).  You can always "override" the fee limit (even in Eclair), since it is all relative to the amount.  It's a bit of a singularity for a small payment.  You may not actually care about paying 3 sat fees for a 22 sat transaction.
The most I've paid is 3 sat in fees.

You have to think long term solution.  As cool as LN is, it is just starting to show it's potential.  When we have AMP, splice in and splice out, and Sphinx payments then there will be no reason to ever even consider something like 0 conf when you can always have instant cryptographically secured payments.

Bitcoin has no central authority to make any such change since it requires a hard fork.  Unlike other centralized coins, BTC can't just make a change like this.  Segwit was a soft fork and even that was a challenge to activate.  It is extremely unlikely a hard fork will ever happen.

Consider that your personal (identifying) information is required by Coinbase not because they need it, but because of government regulations and anti money laundering laws.  In fact, this shows that Bitcoin is not a tool to undermine government as many critics often argue, but it is just as (or possibly more so) suited for use as a currency.  When a drug deal happens with a suitcase of cash, there is no record.  If it happens with Bitcoin, it is publicly visible.

That's how markets work.  Someone just bought $X worth of bitcoin, and so every single small and medium ask was filled up until $X was spent.   This happened so fast that there was little time to put in more bids, and so the next sale at the bottom of the spread was triggered by the 0.07BTC.

That is an ignorant view.  Nobody in history has ever succeeded with that view.  You (mist likely) live in a democracy, not a tyranny.  Grow up and get involved in politics if you think you feel like you are treated unfairly.
You are probably given plenty of chances to succeed, and if you don't realize that, you do not deserve success.  You probably have an education, you probably have permission to move to another town or city.  You probably have permission to talk to other people.  You probably have permission to own property.  Shit, you have it made, so stop complaining about 'tyranny' you drama queen, and make something of your life.

Let me explain my shitty attitude to you.  Anyone with a bit of common sense would know that anti-virus software in general will not stop all possible threats and exploits.

It depends on the size of your utxos.  I pay 1 sat per byte and around 100 satoshi in fees to get BTC on chain.  You should keep some Satoshi for closing the channel, so 20000 satoshi is reasonable for tipping and to play with LN.  That's about $0.69 to start a lightning channel.  I recommend just putting at least $20 worth of BTC in to just play around.
If you want to earn some more BTC via LN, you can add content to a LN powered social media website I'm building at   In the future, I'll be adding a feature where you can withdraw using an on-chain transaction opening a LN channel.

There are a few options that I suggest:
* Encrypt using user password which is required on first use to unlock the API keys.
* Connect to a 2FA service such as Google Authenticator to unlock API keys.
* Require the user to input the keys on each start, so the user can use an encrypted container from which to pull the keys.
* When doing a money/info call, if the key has withdraw enabled, send a warning to the user that this type of key should not be used with your library.

You are confusing issues.  It doesn't matter where you live.  It never will.  It's just so damn easy to succeed in a western country that I find the argument that you should not follow tax law absolutely juvenile.
I never said that the use of violence against non-violent (or any for that matter) is moral or not.  That is another issue.  The fact is, that you can protest this, you can vote against this, you can change this.  That is NOT a tyranny.
It is such a fallacy to think 51% makes the democracy.  This is not true.  The truth is that the decisions are made by a select few representing individuals who act on behalf of the people.

Yes, this is called arbitrage. You do make money, and it helps to make the markets more efficient.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:15:14
Okay, this concerns me.  Here is why:


Are these verified accounts? I doubt it.  These accounts are probably being created as a bot-net of sorts to generate lag in order to manipulate the market.  Transfer in 2 BTC to each account and then put in hundereds of micro-bids.  Buy back as market order and repeat.  Since Gox has to re-evaluate funds to trigger new orders at each price-point, this will generate massive lag for them.  
This will cost the person generating the lag, but they will be the first to dump after their pumping.  
Now this isn't even the scariest part.  The fact the Gox would be so oblivious to this.  That is scary.

Well, i don't "need" to use a logarithmic scale,  but [here you go](
The growth rate is dramatic whether I use exponential or linear scales.  This is going to have to stop at some point, and I fear that the more the growth rate increases, the "sharper" the peak will be.  Hopefully it's a graceful leveling off, but that is not always the case.  
The question remaining is not if, but when this will happen.

I learned about bitcoin when it was around $0.05.  I was studying the cryptographic properties of it.  It took me some time to really understand it, and didn't invest until it was worth a few dollars.  I started with only $50 and tested that I could put fiat in, take fiat out, etc.  It worked.  I then started putting some reasonable cash in.
Then the AML stuff started kicking in and I had to verify my identity, which I did..  This delayed me buying more, but I did anyway later at the peak of the $30 pop.  I now do a 2-fold strategy: part buy and hold + part trade on the volatility.
I am not IMO rich off of this, but since I feel I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals, I truly believe that it's going to be around for the long-haul.  One day....
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:31:37
This is what I suspect: This bot was not designed to make profit itself.  It's purpose is to create lag in order to "game" the software behind Mt.Gox.  The actions of this bot actually generates a small loss, but behind it is probably a user with deep pockets running the "pump".  Then the user executes it's multiple "dumps" and creates lags using said bot to prevent other users from selling in order to maximize his own profits before others get a chance to sell.

This is equivalent to your web-browser saving your logins, passwords, and credit card numbers for websites as plain text.  People would flip their shit if they found out this was happening.

Why are you taking the price from bitcoinity if you are buying on gox?  The quote is the closest price, but you are not guaranteed to get it.  It also matters if it was a limit or a market order.  Is it possible you made the mistake and not Gox?  (hint: yes it is possible)
