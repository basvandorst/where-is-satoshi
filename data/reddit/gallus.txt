It's a dead project but I think maybe this: [Mercury - Fully trustless cryptocurrency exchange](

Any chance you could let us know when they are being sold with this feature? I'll make sure I buy one, even though I already have more than I should, including the lavender one :)

You should try comparing  and the original Bitcoin website from 2009 
They both use "&lt;font size=+1&gt;" which isn't too common (I think?) and protect the email address with a (not all that?) similar image:
Can you find more similarities?

Oh wow, so it's sha256(sha256(chunk1)+sha256(chunk2)) ?

You are wrong:

Okay, but my understanding is that sha256 is not parallelizable. For example, if you look at the pseudocode [here]( you can see that each chunk is processed in order "for each chunk". Also, the result of the first time through the loop is used in the second loop (see the lines directly below "Add the compressed chunk to the current hash value:" and "Add the compressed chunk to the current hash value:").

Can someone please explain this part:
"This means chunk 2 remains unchanged for multiple hashing attempts and work is therefore saved."
Why does changing chunk 1 not force you to do more work to rehash chunk2? I could understand if it was the other way around.

Thank you for the reply, but I think I'm still missing something. Isn't the block header getting hashed with SHA256? I thought SHA256 fed the result of hashing the nth 64 byte chunk into n+1 chunk. Or is the saved work somewhere else I'm missing?

Thank you.

Found this interesting as well (sorry for quoting something so old but remember this is from 2011:
