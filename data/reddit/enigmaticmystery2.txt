You are totally right. Options markets are "scary" and risky. Best of luck in your forex endeavors. Especially when nations peg their currency(without notice)and adjust to debt to GDP and other world factors on a whim. Oh, and that forex broker you use to trade is watching your pittance of a bet so they can run your stop w/out consequences regardless of actual price and take your sad excuse for a trading account. Truth hurts. Bud, if you don't have a 9 figure account and say you are a forex pro trader I'm really �� to say your account WILL be chipped away to zero dollars very quickly. Not trying to be smug. You need to know the truth. Also, yes I say dumb shit on DNM cuz I'm Tony Montana's heir. You feel me? Do you get how insignificant your dumb forex account is?

If you haven't had an unfair trade in the forex market my hat is off to you good sir. Just be careful. Peace and love.

That is a parabolic move, not a "swing". Read 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.' The financial illiteracy on this sub makes me cringe.

"Basic logic on how to trade professionally." OMFG I get your skepticism and that is healthy in order to become a pro trader. Im sorry for being a smug douche however I own 2 seats at the CBOE. I am really done with this pissing contest. However, if you are serious about this biz, it's my duty to help newbies like yourself.

Did you downvote me? I know the math of implied volatility versus actual and Have written white papers on this very subject. I don't anticipate moves, only buy and sell volatility and provide orderly markets for retail traders. You are out of your depth. If you bot a few stocks and made a few bucks, more power to you. I don't anticipate shit my man. I buy and sell based on magnitude of moves, not actual price. That is for punters.

Plz stay away from forex my friend. The deck is stacked against you. I trade currency futures. ECN's are equities mm's. I want you succeed, DM me for anything you want to know.

Also, the forex broker you have sees every trade u make and can and will unethically "run your stops". Seriously the forex market is run by banks that trade in 10-100 million dollar increments PER TRADE. Just to give you perspective on the REAL forex market. Look at currency futures if you enjoy world currencies.

I know you're a youngin' and I encourage people to get interested in the markets, but saying there is more risk in the options market than there is in forex made me audibly gasp.

Or it can dive to 1,200. Who knows

Fibonacci sequence has almost nothing to do with a parabolic move, except maybe the 1.61 extension which Bitcoin flew through. The 2 year harmonic showed that bitcoin was way over extended at 2,100.

Greed, ignorance mostly.

People are reckless at this point. Trying to successfully time a parabolic move is like a guy/gal driving a YUGO suddenly thinking he/she can win the Indy 500. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:21:59
Dude, wat?  Did you invent a new math?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:25:42
I used to be a scalper in my early days. Now I only trade swing(1 day-6weeks). Yes I am profitable.

ECN's route and execute trades that hit the tape and have NO relationship to brokers. I do okay but educating people gives me purpose.
