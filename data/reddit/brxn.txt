If Ross's attorneys were barred from using information such as 'the investigators themselves were brought up on criminal charges' and 'the investigators had every credential needed to impersonate Ross' and the jurors were prevented from knowing this information, then Ross did not get a fair trial.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:34:46
I would just say that most of us are rational enough to know that the government getting away with breaking the law in order to press charges sets an awful precedent that is ultimately much worse for society than any one single criminal can be. Also, we are rational enough to know that if Ross had been on the 'other side of the curtain' such as being a wealthy connected individual, then his trial would have easily been won on numerous technicalities.

I hope by now that most of us Bitcoin people (or hell.. Internet people or Reddit browsers in general) are recognizing that most regulatory agencies are only there (putting most of their efforts) to protect existing power structures. For example.. the recent Fed meeting recordings with Goldman Sachs showed that the regulatory agency did little in actual regulation of a too-big-to-fail financial giant whose maneuvers in 2006-2008 threatened the entire financial state of the world. Meanwhile, every Bitcoin entrepreneur who has any sort of publicized success has been harassed by multiple agencies and tied down in ongoing legal proceedings.. Bitstamp.. Coinbase.. Winklevoss Twins.. even MtGox had $5million seized from them by the DHS before they reportedly did anything wrong. Another example of regulatory agencies protecting those with power would be the fact that property and loan transfer fees were not charged to the numerous banks that failed to pay them or complete the proper paperwork - but believe me, you and I will pay these same fees if you refinance a house.
The regulations proposed in Bitlicense are stated to prevent 'money laundering' - but they are intended to prevent power transfer away from those that have it. It is intended to limit Bitcoin to a niche market and make it difficult to adopt. If you look at the overall pros and cons of one extreme over the other, it seems obvious that a few cases of money laundering is preferable over forcing every person that partakes in Bitcoin (or the future of the financial system) to lose all ability to keep protocol-enabled privacy.
The principled stance would be to follow the US Constitution on this matter. The principled stance would be to attempt to maximize individual freedom and free market principles. The principled stance would be to allow a group of consenting adults to trade whatever the hell they want for goods and services - whether it be Bitcoins or shiny seashells. If it's not illegal, then it's legal. That should be the idea. The fact that the lot of us are sitting around waiting for regulatory agencies to expressively make something that is not illegal into a permission-based legal privilege means that we are not doing our parts to follow the original intent of the Bitcoin protocol. If Bitlicense gets imposed, we are all less free and a part of the protocol is broken.
Thank-you, EFF.

The part that I wish everyone could understand at once is this:
All dollars are issued as debt. Debt is to be repaid with interest. Therefore, the debt will always increase more than dollars available to repay the debt. Eventually, this will cause the banks that issue the debt to own more and more of everything until they eventually own everything.. or until the US decides to default or write off the debt owed to the Federal Reserve.

As frustrated as I got with the unprofessional appearance of Mt Gox, I have to remember that Mt Gox had $5million seized from it by the DHS. I know of few businesses (aside from huge corporations) that can manage to stay liquid after having $5million locked up. For all we know, the US gov't (whether authorized or not) was secretly picking at Mt Gox and gagging them from saying anything about it leaving Karpeles to look like some bumbling idiot who has no clue what is happening.
Essentially, the US gov't prevented Bitcoin's continued rapid ascent and postponed the 'Bitcoin revolution' for a few years. I wonder where the price and acceptance of Bitcoin would be if all of those stolen coins were not dumped on the market and Mt Gox was able to maintain operations.

They certainly do not want Bitcoin to succeed so no bank will 'buy up Bitcoins'. Most people that have a stash of them know they have quite a ways to go until people understand them so they are not selling them. Unless there are some banks already sitting on a hoard of Bitcoins, existing banks are cut out of this economy - and I think that is a good thing. The good news is that at current adoption, a single bitcoin will make a person very wealthy if they are widely adopted in the future.
As far as your worry about banks accumulating a lot of coins, how about the fact that banks already accumulated a lot of property (which they should have taken losses on) and can now pick and choose the property they sell back to the Federal Reserve to the tune of $80billion/month? Every time the Federal Reserve buys the bank trash, it further dillutes the spending power of the average individual. The banks are essentially taxing the rest of the economy and grabbing a larger and larger slice of the pie.
Essentially, we are in a run-away printing cycle where the difference between severe inflation and deflation is just a tiny change in the Federal Reserve's behavior. The Bitcoin is a very good hedge against this potential inflation and creates a reason to believe in saving something. I am not advocating putting all your eggs into the Bitcoin basket since we still have the inevitable 'government crackdown on something disruptive by making it retroactively illegal.' But, my guess is that it will be very hard to ignore the power that Bitcoin gives back to the average person and because of that, it will be widely adopted.

I am not sure I agree with this sentiment. They are interpreting the law as they see how it applies - and the interpretation seems fair enough for me. It is a case where those in power - despite the threat of their power by Bitcoin - are actually applying the law as it is written. The lawmakers that try to call Bitcoin illegal already, despite no legal basis, are the ones that are a threat to us.
As far as this interpretation, it puts one 'government' position on Bitcoin that it is legal and legitimate. This is a step in the right direction.
And, if you don't recognize their authority in this matter, do you run red lights too?

I am saying that every time someone does something 'disruptive' that may challenge a current cash cow, that cash cow comes out claiming that it is illegal. The RIAA called mp3s illegal.. completely illegal at first. Then, they said ripping cds to mp3 was illegal. Many lawmakers parroted that. Therefore, people considered them illegal.

Those 'licenses' weren't even necessary before mt gox started trading bitcoins before everyone else.

Every news article calls him arrogant... Just watch videos of him and decide if he really is arrogant.
Edit.  I mean to say he does not seem arrogant from what I've seen... But you should decide for yourself instead of risking merely repeating what a reporter wants you to say.

FinCEN released an 'interpretation' of existing laws just recently. DHS is siezing MTGox's account based on breaking a 'guideline' for a law. If Bitcoin is a commodity, it does not need to follow FinCEN's guidelines. If Bitcoin is currency, then it may or may not need to follow FinCEN's guidelines to be decided by a court.
In the US, right now, everything 'disruptive' is illegal. MP3s were considered illegal at first until everyone and Apple finally were already using them. Bitcoin, whether a commodity or currency, is disruptive. However, it is NOT breaking existing laws unless those in charge decide to start creating new interpretations of laws just to apply to Bitcoin.

It is so refreshing to see some anti-government defiance coming from a guy in China.

All my former poly sci professors still won't say anything back to me about Ron Paul.. Academia is where you go to learn how to conform.

Does it make sense that I think of choosing Bitcoin as making a political statement?
Like.. what if I just made my purchase in Bitcoin, and then immediately purchased the same amount of Bitcoins on an exchange in order to replenish my Bitcoin investment?

Explanations like these will get more people into actually trying to understand Bitcoin..

It's pretty damn impossible to make the Feds happy if you are a new disruptive startup. If you are an existing financial institution, the Feds will bend over backwards for you.
