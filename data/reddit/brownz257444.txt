But since I'm in the us I cannot withdrawal anything from kraken unless I'm tier 3 is there a way around this?

Let it drop or go up I'm still holding...
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:15:10
What does this really mean? I'm too slow to understand charts with lines.

U got bch on ur breadwallet but it's invisible if you want to figure out how to move it good luck until breadwallet announces a app for bch. I've found a way but just don't feel like doing anything with my bch so I'll hold until breadwallet makes a wallet for bch.

What is a good wallet to use to send my bitcoin cash since they don't recommend anyone? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:28:17
Any good recommendations for exchanges I was using coinbase would hate to go back after the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:54:24
So what ur saying is wait until shit settles then store it in bitcoinabc?
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:15:25
