I should have phrased the original post better because you're right, there is SOME chance Bitcoin will drop to levels as low as those. That being said, a drop that substantial would likely take some major event happening. So I have confidence it will stay because its my totally unweighted opinion that a drop that significant is unlikely (or as likely as with stocks/other similar investments). 
And to hold your investment through a 60%+ percent drop is not at all unreasonable if you're invested in the space for more reasons than just the price.
For the record, I don't advocate hodling at all costs. When dealing with a drop 85%+ , selling and buying back in later does become more worthwhile. I believe in the space and really just think people should hodl onto as much Bitcoin as possible, whether that be hanging tight or buying more on the ride down.

I don't know that it's pointless. There are certainly some uneducated investors with a significant amount of capital who may be misled by claims of bitcoins volatility and potential to lose "all" of its value.
The $6K cash out is certainly a hefty lost, but $6K is very different from $0. Understanding that bitcoin will most likely never truly fall to that degree might give those people some confidence to stay.

Dollar cost averaging, as you've hinted at, is a good way to allocate your portfolio in Bitcoin. It'll average out your buy in cost no matter what happens to the price. 
That being said , you cant be "affected" by the price drops as long as you don't sell your Bitcoin back for cash at a loss !

You don't lose any money until you sell your coin. Even if you buy and it goes up, it could always come back down before heading up again. So just don't sell it
