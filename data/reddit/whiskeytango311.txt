What if you bought an old record at a garage sale for $2 that turned out to be worth $20,000. Then your brother trades you a Picasso sketch worth $20k for the record. Essentially in the eyes of the IRS even though you didn’t sell the Picasso for fiat, you owe them the tax on $19,998.

Pretty simple math actually. If 19% of people owned btc, approximately 19% of business owners would own btc, and it’s so simple to allow your business to accept btc, approximately 19% of businesses should be accepting it by now. But we know this isn’t true. So in actuality I bet less than 3% of people in the US own bitcoin and this statistic is completely fabricated.

When bitcoin becomes "stable" it will achieve a market cap similar to gold.  100 billion dollars in a global market is literally 1 drop in a swimming pool.  Global Forex is over 300 billion dollars per day.  
Bitcoin will peak again, and again and again, and the charts will look very similar doing so.  The reason bitcoin will continue to rise, and the charts look the same (including stock charts), is because of 1 simple thing, human psychology.

Heres the billion dollar idea. My gift.  Someone needs to make a payment processing center like a credit card machine, that processes bitcoin transactions and acts as a lightning network node all in one.  Simple as a credit card machine, without the PCI compliance and bullshit that comes along with it.  Make it very simple for mom and pop type businesses to use.  Then get out there and start setting companies up.

Exactly. So it becomes almost a group effort to increase the price. That comes by less newly minted coins being sold, therefore creating a shortage and increasing price. It’s not a coordinated effort it’s basically a group consciousness.

You have that backwards, the maximum value is what someone is willing to pay for it. The minimum value is what someone is willing to sell theirs for. If someone came to me and said “I’ll sell you 1 btc for $50” I’ll buy it but that doesn’t make the value $50. That bitcoin is no longer for sale.

I believe the big banks are silently accumulating as much as they can without disrupting prices. Don’t think for a second that they aren’t. Because at the end of the day when the paradigm shift happens the banks will swoop in, have their assets and they’re will only be enough left for your .001 btc cut.

One side of me thinks the chart will ultimately look the same, the other side of me thinks a recovery could happen faster because there are more people involved and everything moves faster when more people and more money moves the market. I think about the halvening and I know that will probably price itself in months before the actual event. I know a lot of people have emotions and want to think that December was the ath and bitcoin will now have its slow demise, but they thought the same thing every time it had an ath and bleed off. Ultimately the fundamentals of the technology get better every day, and people need to realize even with that big run last year, still less than 1% of the world was involved. Next run 3% might be involved. What if 5% are involved? Then 12%. I still think we are 12-15 years away from mainstream adoption and actually stable prices.

Price will begin to climb up to the halvening as miners hold more than they sell. After the halvening when it doesn’t moon, (but the price level is attractive compared to today) they sell in droves bringing the price down 30-50% from the peak. Then over the next 6-12 months it will climb past ath and into uncharted territory.

If a company made a multi billion dollar deal and were paid in btc, I’m sure a lot of that btc will need to be sold for fiat to continue day to day operations.  20 or 30 years from now there may be a supplier chain system that allows a btc only economy. But for now btc has to be sold. I’m awake.

Decentralized roads. Micropayment system linked to the gps in your car, when you turn from street A to street B a micropayment is sent to the manager of street B and he takes care of that street with said payments. Typically property lines go to the center of the street in front of said property. Government doesn’t own the streets. Businesses will pay to have nice streets in front of their businesses to allow customers safe travel in and out of their establishments. Everything government does is wasteful and overspent. Decentralizing roads could fix a lot of problems truthfully.

That will be in the year 2140 so none of us will be around to see it. But I assume mining rewards at that point will be transaction fees. 
Edit, I guess I didn’t really answer your question. The value will be astronomical. When miners are processing transactions for millisatoshis, a whole bitcoin will be an unimaginable amount of wealth.

Depends on when it happens. If it happens next year they will probably turn to metals. If it happens in 30 years and bitcoin is mature and can handle millions of transactions a day etc, they will probably turn to it. Assuming they aren’t buying it all up in the meantime, then it’s a simple switch.
