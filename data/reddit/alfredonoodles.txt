What's the coin called?
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:43:53
Always use it.  Have spent around $4k on there with bitcoin. Xmas was especially only paid for with bitcoin through gyft.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:47:57
Maybe he can use it towards buying his truck for pumpkin season.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:42:59
Hopefully nothing goes missing.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:18:33
It should have.

And those that show their face....if she has a butterface I wouldn't bother with the tits...I'd offer her plastic surgery on her face.

I would be afraid the IRS would audit me if I did that. Luckily 90% of my BTC is in cold storage and only 1% of the 10% I play with was in Mt.Gox.  
Gox baited me by offering their yubikey free and ID Verification within 24 hours in 2012...assholes.
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:37:34
Ive yet to use it, but I've seen it a lot more the past week or so.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:30:17
So your selling at roughly $80-$100 cheaper than market? 
Also, what's that smell? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:22:25
Bathrooms look better then the Sochi Olympics!
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:37:34
You want PCMCIA
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:12:05
Dumb article.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:39:40
Lol, yea, agreed...this is the beginning of the trek back to $1k
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:06:42
All you need is the walllet.dat file and if its encrypted, the password. 
Replace your current wallet.dat with the one from your backup files...load the bitcoin client, and your coin will be there.
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:02:23
Backup your wallet.dat file to a USB drive.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:23:44
Move your newly purchased BTC to cols storage asap!  Storing online is not smart.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:49:36
If you are in the USA, I don't feel bad if you lost fiat or btc in gox...should've taken it out after the government seized their US accounts last year at the latest.
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:04:02
If you did it right, and did so much research, you would've sold and rebought a few times! 
Ride the waves! Don't bail!
@_date: 2014-11-24 22:33:35
Doing this for sure! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:06:50
They gave away free yubikeys 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:36:27
Guarantee we go up to $600 again in the next 72 hours.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:47:08
They started selling 'futures', so now you can buy GHS for the upcoming projected price for the next month or even the month after that.
They are also trying to launch scrypt mining GHS.
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:23:54
Awesome. Thanks for posting this. I'm considering upgrading my ecig and this is perfect.
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:06:59
By making your post you just pulled the dead horses eyelids back.

Lol @ the amateur women part...why isn't she a professional women...hasn't she been a women all her life?
Also, no donation unless I see her face. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:19:20
Lol , the website is very poorly done. Screams scam.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:37:04
Zeroblock &amp; C.C.E. apps on android are up to date. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:15:12
Try Cryptothrift I've used it often with success and it offers many different cryptocoins as payment options including BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:09:00
I believe if you post in all caps they ban. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:02:33
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:00:28
You probably won't succeed with Apple. Develop for Android!
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:53:20
There's ways. But why buy when it'll be worthless on their site.
Its already down 35% in the last 24 hours. Probably will drop another 20% in 12-15 hours.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:07:37
Oh, yea, if your current wallet.dat your replacing has any coins, back it up too before replacing it with the one from the phone backup.
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:29:36
3 days
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:50:40
Nah, they just scrypting for a paycheck.
@_date: 2016-01-24 05:45:38
BWpool personal stash?
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:59:33
BTCMP , where do you stand???
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:04:48
Are they new to Pied Piper?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:07:40
Is slush the only pool doing it?
@_date: 2015-08-27 04:45:07
What speeds are those? 1x?

126,315 BTC (US$12.4 million @ $98.17/per bitcoin)
Sale was announced 2 years ago TODAY July 18 2013.
He did have legal fees and penalties for multiple unregistered securities since 2013.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:57:31
Yea this is bitcoin now, cheap asses not using the appropriate fee. Use a more supportive fee next time, I personally do 0.0006-0.001 and never see major delays.
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:03:28
Or just drive your BMW and take some weapons.....
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:53:35
PayPal did/does have a Debit card linked to your PayPal account....I had one back around 2008, maybe even sooner then that. I don't think they issue them anymore. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:36:32
Any relation to AxeCop?
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:05:46
Isis pump and dump coming, anyone here from Whaleclub to confirm?
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:07:31
Mooooom, mooom, damnit...MAAAAAH...WE MADE IT
