I didn't get this vibe at all from OP. I assume he just asked them if they're going to invest/told them about it and they went apeshit.
I mean, I've told people to invest and they didn't want to. Then I leave them alone.

Governments are already controlling it unfortunately. They want to ban it in most of the Asian countries now.

No one could've predicted it would be over $10,000 now dude. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:52:48
Oh no I would've also felt miserable and depressed over it for sure haha.

How much bitcoin did you buy when it was low?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:20:52
Lol dude. You serious right now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:22:42
He hasn't done anything for it. Still don't understand why you guys are stroking him off this much.
Everything he says could've easily been found out yourself.

Or their house gets taken back because they can't pay their rent. 
People with money and financial security always say money can't buy happiness. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:35:48
You need money to do all those things though.
Money is everything. What's the point I'm 60 years old and well off. There's no point to money then, because I'll be old and useless. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:06:24
Yeah I still haven't got my FUCKING BONUS. 
It all works out though, might get it today or the latest tomorrow so this dip is at the perfect time!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:37:50
Haha nice man!
I told my dad to buy when it hit below $4K. He still thought it won't go up again lmao.
He missed out on a great opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:27:58
I don't understand how he moves it? Did he sell 25K bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:27:32
Yeah I'm a noob in all this.
Appreciate the feedback
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:12:29
Is there even still a point to buy/invest? I mean the price is almost over $8,000.00...
I only have $1,500.00 that I can invest. Should I do it with BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:57
If only I could buy now. I'm waiting on my work bonus to arrive before I can invest.
Probably only getting that the 13th of December though.
Let's hope the drop stays for 2 more weeks (wishful thinking)
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:37:06
I didn't say there wasn't any point. But yeah I agree the price will skyrocket. 
, shall hodl for life.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:52:34
You're smart.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:31:51
Over $6 for a beer??!
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:22:27
CAN I JUST GET MY FUCKING BONUS ALREADY SO I CAN INVEST FUUUCK
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:29
I have a question. Say I have an eToro account as well as a  Bitcoin wallet. 
Can I transfer the money to my wallet and then receive the amount in coins?
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:56:37


Jesus you people are deluded.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:54:48
Lol I love how you've all deluded yourselves into thinking this is something positive.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:08:40
I've been following this sub a while now, even with another account. I too was full of belief and positivity, but seeing how things are now... It's not a pleasant sight.
