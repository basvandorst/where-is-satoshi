Really? How much did you buy?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:08
High trade volume in a decline is considered bearish. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:39:20
Order book on GDAX shows there is interest in buying as the price gets lower. The people buying are those who believe their price is the bottom of this price fall or near bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:37:44
Is there an /s in there or are you seriously hurting? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:22:24
I saw at least 100 BTC actually sold in the trade history (two big chunks, one ~60BTC). The rest were rapid and small quantities so perhaps 50% were taken down.

Approaching ~700 buy wall on GDAX at $10,200. **Hold on to your butts ladies and gents.**

I'll take that bet. Sub $8,000 bottom with an eventual recovery to around $10,500 as new norm for awhile.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:03
Approaching $10,500 ~~sell~~ **buy** wall on GDAX as of 4:29p EST. Wall around ~192 at the time of this post.  
  
Edit: Typo correction.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:11:46
It just means high trading activity. It can be positive on a bullish candle and negative on a bearish candle.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:18:59
Wall breached completely as of 4:18p EST on GDAX and falling rapidly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:39
Careful of the falling knife. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:33
You can defer your tax burden to 2019 by selling in 2018 versus selling in 2017. We saw massive growth in 2017 and there are individuals who wanted to close their position to realize their profits without creating a tax liability in the near future.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:33:35
Lol, my bad it is indeed a buy wall. Bad typo.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:13
More like soft bull turds.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:07
I shook out at $14,500 in the green and am waiting for bottom to jump back in. It's called "buy low sell high". 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:10
While they own responsibility, I don't relish in the financial demise of others. Especially when innocent people are affected (e.g. parents, spouses, and children). I was making a point that it is beyond "just money" for a lot of people for various reasons. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:57:56
Tighter regulations in China/Korea combined with numerous futures contracts expiring tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:32:42
It can happen during intense market volatility. I saw a $74 spread on GDAX yesterday during the dive.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:34:01
Depends if the wall collapses or is actually sold through in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:41:02
I wish... I'm guessing it will bounce way before that though.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:22
The Order Book will only show limit orders while the Trade History will reflect Market Orders and Limit Orders.

Not saying bitcoin is dead, but this bubble is popping. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:41:07
How much did you sink in?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:48:42
Would you be in financial trouble if you lost it all? If so, bail. If not wait and see what happens over the next several weeks/months.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:45
Lol, I come on reddit to discuss my hobbies. I feel sorry for you that you think playing video games makes me a loser. And yes, I have purchased bitcoin. I even made a post to this community about how I was wrong about bitcoin, and cashed out a small % of my stock investments into BTC. I rode a little wave and cashed out when I saw trouble.  
  
Why so defensive? If you are bleeding out in this dive just pull out and jump in at bottom. No need to attack people.

Approaching $11,000 wall on GDAX as of 4:17p EST.

If you are still defining crypto's value in U.S. dollars, which currency is the winner (at this time)?  
  
Maybe one day we will measure fiat in terms of BTC, though you can't really be certain that it will be permanent unless you have a crystal ball. Google the term "Black Swan".  
  
Right now, it's not entirely clear what will happen. With the USD having a longer track record and government backing, it isn't entirely unreasonable for some people to not see it as realized gains until they close their position.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:24:30
**Please be careful of the [dead cat bounce]( This may appear to be a recovery, but note the two different pictures being painted on GDAX by simply changing the candle interval from 15 minutes to 1 day:
  
* [15 minute candle](
  
* [1 day candle](  
  
**Be cautious here.**
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:57:43
Whoops thought you were a different OP who asked what to do. My bad.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:35:00
I jumped at $14,500 and will buy back in once it hits bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:45:24
For some people, it could mean their homes, bankruptcy, and divorce. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:15:00
Truth. The early adopters that got out at 20k must be living it up.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:50:11
That’s great and all but bubbles aren’t exclusive to stocks.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:59:00
There are numerous scenarios explaining why someone would want to shift their tax burden to a different year. One timely example is the new tax law in the U.S. that has passed. A person can reduce their tax owed under the tax cuts, which did not take effect until 2018. If a person made a nice profit in 2017, it would be wise to wait until 2018 to sell to take advantage of this. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:04:13
To answer your question, more people need to submit buy orders than sell orders. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:12

Fiat is backed by governments.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:30
Not sustainable in its current state. Though there are active projects aiming to decrease this fee as well as the power consumption required to process one transaction (currently at the power consumption of 9 households).
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:14:05
I wanted to share my regret and apologize for my ignorance many years ago. I believe with lightning coming bitcoin’s future as a currency is one more step in the right direction. It appreciated because there is value in having a decentralized international currency. Something I did not see being so widely adopted years ago. I understand that at some point it must stabilize or else be confined to a store of wealth (though I believe now it is has far more use than an alternative to gold).
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:54:36
Yes, by definition it is... Here’s a simple wiki page on it if you are interested: 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:58
Some would point to the [rapid adoption of platforms like Coinbase]( which allows quick and easy purchase of BTC by even the most novice and inexperienced user. Others agree with you that there must be institutional investors or independent whales pumping BTC. The pump and dump wasn't easily accomplished before, but now with futures big institutional players can easily and legally accomplish a massive short.  
  
In either case it is going to be fascinating.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:05
USD is backed by the United States of America.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:11:16
I appreciate that, and agree that now is a better time to start than tomorrow. I look forward to the future of bitcoin (lightning looks like it will be a big step for the currency) and will take it all as a lesson learned not to keep a closed mind.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:28
Coinbase. You’ll start with a $200 limit for debit cards and it will increase with time and account use.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:00:48
By definition, fiat money is government backed. Quit trolling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:06:15
This is headed towards arguing semantics here... what is your definition of “backed by”? My definition for a currency would be the government using its power to enforce its value. Both USD and Bitcoin have no intrinsic value, but the U.S. government backs USD, aka it supports and enforces the value of USD.
  
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:48:04
Nah. I’m fully employed and make over the median for my state. I’m buried in debt, but not destitute.  
  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:44:41
I believe that is the sentiment among large financial institutions. They hope to short it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:46
No one knows for certain what it will do, but know this:  
  
Futures are a sideline bet about whether the price of an asset will go up or down. No one in futures is actually trading the asset. Since the asset isn't being bought or sold, the price of the asset will not fluctuate.  
  
That said, if it somehow became public knowledge that a well known and respected financial institution ordered a $500,000,000 short on BTC via a future, then traders on the exchanges that actually trade BTC may panic sell. The reverse scenario is also a possibility.  
  
At this time, there are no major financial institutions dumping serious money into the actual BTC exchanges... at least not publicly. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:02:35
In 2010 BTC was dirt cheap...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:00:28
That’s the joke, OP is being spiteful.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:21
I wouldn't want to see main street investors lose their shirts either, but we will see what happens. You are correct that there may be **very large players** pumping BTC who intend to exit their position and go straight into a short. Or maybe it's organic. We'll see soon. CME Futures begin Sunday.
