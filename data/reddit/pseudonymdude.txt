If you believe Cryptsy is going to default and you have a decent amount of bitcoins there, try DOGE and DGB.  Try smaller amounts first to make sure they're still working.  You will lose a little over 20% on the conversion.
If you have stuck withdrawals, you can contact support to cancel.

GoCoin allows you to accept BTC, DOGE, and LTC.

If some stop mining it, the difficulty will fall.  Bitcoin is programmed so that the average transaction over a long period of time should always be 10 minutes.
If half the people stop mining all at once, then the average transaction time will be 20 minutes or so until difficulty readjusts, but this scenario is extremely unlikely.

There will actually be a block reward for over 130 more years.

Right, but mining will still be profitable for those then doing it.
The current cost per transaction that you linked to is not very relevant.  If there are more transactions, the cost per transaction goes down.  The lower the bitcoin price and the lower the bitcoin reward also will push the cost/transaction down.  Having a cost/transaction of $14 is not necessary to keep the network secure.  That's just what it is currently.
edit: To explain a little more clearly, we're still currently in a heavy distribution period for bitcoin.  25% of it will be distributed from 2012 to 2016.  Obviously, the hope is that more and more people will make transactions with it and that the price will rise, offsetting some of the miner's lost revenue from shrinking block rewards in the future; but $14/transaction is nowhere near necessary, imo.  That's happening because the heaviest distribution periods are occurring while adoption/transactions are low.

Yeah.  I was not expecting it to breach 180.

Vcash has done it:
