Tether is a ponzi

Not 19k

Smart money folks don’t have a time machine to return to 2014 and buy more, but they can still make a shit-ton of money buying this dip.  Why wouldn’t they buy at 10k if they have projections they trust putting it back up to 15k or 20 when the FUDshit is over? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:38:41
Yeah because the majority of the time the news came from someone talking out of their ass 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:27:11
Yeah that’s what the smart money is doing at least.  Feel free to give away your coins at a 30% discount from what you paid if you prefer

I’m not going to say someone shouldn’t have bought at 19k.  To that person, Bitcoin was worth 19k at the time, else they wouldn’t have paid that price.  They likely did so thinking the price had nowhere to go but up, which would have been a foolish assumption but at the time everyone was drunk on crypto mania (greed) and throwing caution to the wind in hopes of getting rich.  For all we knew at the time the price could have been heading to 30 or 40k.  If one bought in at that price without considering the risk of the price going down, then they were a fool.

I don’t.  They invested more than they could afford to lose because they were likely consumed by greed.  Now that they’ve been burned, they hopefully will learn not to trade on emotion again. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:23:10
Then you’ll be rich again when it goes back up 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:43:07
Then we’re all fucked. Don’t see it happening though 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:05:42
Oh god guys, a few days went by without double digit percentage gains. Crypto is over better panic sell it all!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:17:49
Those buyers shouldn’t have assumed bitcoin is an elevator for their money that only goes up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:24:51
Bit early to make that call, no? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:24:15
So you just lost out from investing in a ponzi now you’re asking about how to make a profit day trading crypto lol.  Don’t lose more money.  You should get out of crypto entirely

“It’s over boys”  - everyone, every single one of the 200 times that btc has gone down in value 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:53:41
Prices have always gone up and down in bitcoin. It’s volatile 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:55:54
Sure, I agree.  I’m only saying people who bought at the peak without considering the risks, and subsequently panicked at the falling price, were foolish 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:22:40
Bitcoin is volatile.  It has lost value in the past.  Jesus 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:35:21
People post bullshit because they want a chance to buy low. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:32:04
There is no ban.  Fake news
