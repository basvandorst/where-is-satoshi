Yes, and the big hills are like "The Battle of Hamburger Hill". All who are left on the big hill, left their bodies of money up there. The pain and suffering has to be bleed out of the market each time. They are all waiting up there to be buried if they jump off. Only the very brave will make it to the next hill. I think it will not be 3 years this time, more compressed as Bitcoin has gone viral.

Here is a link to fee status. 
Seems to be early days in development. I will download it and give a helping hand. I expect this type of software will explode onto the internet over the next years and become very disruptive.

Carl Sagen! His overemphasis of the "b" in "billions" was deliberate; to make sure the word was not mistaken for "millions." Still, he never uttered the catchphrase "billions and billions." BBBBillions!

moving up all day, looks more positive.

Five years ago when I was mining Bitcoin, and understood it solved the Byzantine Generals´ Problem, it was impossible to get the message out. I expect it will remain that way as it is so much easier to look back than forward. I predict that decentralized software will disrupt every type of business worldwide.

I´ll buy on a dip! :-)

We can´t call a top or a bottom, but the top is behind us. Ease back in and keep cash on the side lines is my plan now.

I buy back in now in stages. Don´t expect with mixed chatter a bull run again this soon, but recovery to start.

Looking at paterns is useful. I see the similarity of planting an oak tree seed and watching it grow each season. The first years don´t look much like a tree, but as they go by, each growth period is compound. The next growth period for Bitcoin will take our breath away as it heads past $100,000.

Not sure what it means, but he looks like the guy everyone sees in their dreams. Check the link above.

I watched Bitcoin prove everyone wrong for years, and I expect it is still just the begining. It is a revolution. How the 99% take back from the 1% of the world. I hope they start using it more.

I´ll buy at $1000, any offers? ;-)

I would take a different road with this. When your parents die you will inherit their home and what they made during their lives, after TAX. So really you would get your BTC back from them in the end anyway. I suggest you buy their house now and own it yourself from the BTC you have. Help your parents and yourself. Money can break up friends or pull them together. Watch the big families and how they support each other. Do you want a win win or a lose lose.
