I believe a Blockchain USD is on the horizon.
I am unsure what this will mean for BTC, but virtually is only a good thing for USD. Helps stop fraud, expands surveillance on the individual.

 "Almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the Internet's continuing exponential growth. But I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse."
Robert Metcalfe, founder of 3Com, 1995
Chip TaylorIn addition to being a legendary tech visionary and the man widely credited with having invented Ethernet, Bob Metcalfe was also a columnist for PC World sister publication InfoWorld. And it was in that column that Metcalfe made what must have been the most regrettable comment of his career; indeed, he even promised to eat his words if his augury turned out to be wrong.
 his credit, Metcalfe made good on that promise in 1999 during his keynote speech at the International World Wide Web Conference, where he blended up a copy of his printed column with some liquid and drank it down before a crowd of onlookers.

After about 7 years at .25, bump once in 2015, bump once in 2016, already twice in 2017 and I'm still seeing articles about a 3rd in 2017.
2017 has seen more activity than the last 8 years combined.

huh? did the clinton foundation buy up some bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:29:24
if we need to "get in the game" that means Apple beat us to the new game. Pretty clear the intent was the snuff out the competition rather than human progress.

bitcoin is volatile and requires more checking.
you can guesstimate gold within $100/oz any day 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:54:45
While likely, you cannot say for 100% sure. Hence the what if machine desire.
The Fed buys US bonds at basically no cost to them outside of printing money.
The Fed is neither Federal nor a Reserve.
I never mentioned anything about a conspiracy, I listed the times the interest rates were bumped, and noted in 2017 we have two and there is talk of a 3rd, which is pulling away from the recent trend of a .25 bump in2015/2016 after 7 years of essentially 0
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:35:14
I believe both groups aims are to reduce individual liberty. The real Bitcoin is the epitome of this and the Fed instantly raises interests rates after a decade of 0% as soon as Trump rolls in.

I didn't say the rates being raised were necessarily a bad thing. My conspiracy, that you want to keep coaxing me into, is that the frequency of the increases have increased because of a Trump effect.
Would you support a Federal Reserve crypto backed by US bonds?

I would say the US Dollar is presently used by criminals, criminal bankers, conspiracy theorists, and speculators.
The CryptoDollar would be no different, just much easier to track every dollar. Criminals will use Bitcoin/Other, and the general population will be surveilled in even greater detail.
I do not see how the CryptoDollar could be anything but centralized.
