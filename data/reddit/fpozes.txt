I am from Brasil and I use Walltime to buy from fiat to bitcoin and if I want other cryptos I use Binance. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:06:10
Yeah, I remember that time......

Hi, thanks for asking. I am studying about Bitcoins since July 2017, and I am trying to make people understand how Blockchain and Bitcoin are going to change the world we live. If you have a currency which no government can take it from you as we had in Brazil in Collor's President economy move, we should invest and help them to understand how it works. It's only a little bit of what I can do explaining all country in lectures and using internet.

It's easy to convert in local currency. You can use Xapo wallet and send it to the bank or use an exchange to do it.

I am from Brazil and I agree with you and put all countries called the "Mercosul" in the same situation. Here we are having a big inflation, changing the prices of everything every week. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:10:12
No, you don't know me to say that. You should have respect. I have a master degree in Marketing and Bachelor in Business.

If Brazil makes a wrong choice to choose the next president it will be the next one.
Elections are next November 2018.

Very good answer. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:07:14
That's exactly what I am feeling this past week. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:46:01
I was working at British American Tabaco in Brazil. I was hired to be PCP Analyst and they put a girl to train me. She told me she wouldn't teach me anything because she felt I was there to take her job. She invented to our boss that I wasn't learning and I personally told him she was very rude and she didn't want to help me. I don't know why but he said it was my problem and I had solve it by myself.
I asked for help in other units and another girl who works in Rio Negro PR, helped me and taught everything I should learn.
In the end of the 3rd month, my other boss, I had 3 different, congratulated me for my excellent work, but this guy Vladimir, said he didn't like me because the girl told him I didn't know to do my job. I found out that this girl's father still work at BAT in Rio Grande do Sul and he is a manager there. And he was my ex boss's manager, so...... He preferred to take her side and kick me from my job. Sad story but it's true!

And use blockchain to elect the government. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:49:19
I would put 50/50.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:48:09
Don't pay. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:28:13
I use Xapo. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:04:48
Yes, lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:19:52
Hodl! 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:21:25
June, no feet. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:42:12
Brazil has a killing inflation!
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:12:32
Why? 
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:54:00
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:41:29
Another kind of Scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:31:35
Where did she buy? Very beautiful! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:50:18
I think you are right, we have to buy a lot of btcs and one day, it will become real. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:34:53
I had a problem with Neteller, scam are everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:05:32
I couldn't get the discount. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:47:38
You can use Xapo, scan and send it to your bank account. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:00:29
I want one, where did you buy it? 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:28:22
Yes this kind of problems can happen if you don't have your keys with you. My advice for you next time is to get a paper wallet or hard wallet. I had kind of this problem with Neteller and I had complained for 4 weeks to have my money back. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:23:55
Lol, it's just the beginning..... 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:38:22
I am sorry for your problem.  One day, we aren't going to have banks or exchanges anymore, only p2p payment. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:06:11
It can drop to any price or go to the moon. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:05:02
Thanks
