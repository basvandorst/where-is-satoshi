There is excitement over BTC, and yes the graph was trying to capture that excitement to an extent, whilst also trying to portray the several orders of magnitudes of growth BTC has had since 2010.
Granted, the higher amounts are unclear if you want detail in that region, but I was aiming for aesthetics above practicality where a simply log graph may be preferable.

Lol. That is pretty funny even though I think BCH is quite cool.

I created this in an attempt to obtain some of the advantages of linear and logarithmic graphs. The [linear graph]( whilst intuitive, hides a lot of detail from the lower/earlier prices. On the other hand, a [logarithmic graph]( shows lots of detail, but may be tricky to 'grok' for some people not used to these kind of graphs.
Plus perspective just looks cool!

The Y axis is in powers of 10.

Right in the title.

Thanks! A lot of hard work went into it. Almost gave up on it about 3 times.

How is it wrong?

Heh, do you mean that in a good, bad or indifferent way?
Wasn't consciously trying to aim for an optical illusion - it's only perspective. Just trying to squeeze all that data into one pic without using a log graph or have the peak go through the roof.

Reminds me of a certain Father Ted scene ;)

It's clearly a log graph due to the Y axis figures and non-linear vertical line spacing.
Although you may not be personally used to them, log graphs allow you to see a whole range of data much more clearly and in a new light. For example, in the [linear graph]( look from 2009-2013, it looks like nothing much is happening, when in reality, you could easily become a millionaire by 2013 by investing 'mere' thousands or so in 2009.
A log graph is also better for determining volatility. You want to know how much your investment has halved or doubled, and a linear graph is misleading, as the lower/left portion will always be more 'flat' relative to the higher/right amounts.
In the log graph, each new major vertical line upwards means you've multiplied your cash by ten!

I can't help but feel Hillary and Obama massively condones this kind of spying.
