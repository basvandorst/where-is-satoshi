normal with this horrible mempool size we are looking at right now.

My phone autocorrects however it sees fit. I am smart enough to factor that in about what I read on the internet since about 2016.

More then just a futuristic space-age clad eCommerce site after all.
I just wonder if they held most of their coins or cashed them out. I bought a footstool from them for like 199 in btc when it was like ~700. Hope they had an awesome hodlr for a finance manager!

This coming from the guy who claimed that Coinbase needs to damage bitcoin to survive...yea. You have a solid grip on things.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:20:41
I stopped reading at Christopher Steele. That dudes reporting is about 0% credible.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:06:41
Good thing no one appointed you to declare anything. Lighting is stupid, overly complex and unneeded. You got sold shit, and are saying its gold.
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:36:18
Well without those people, the hash rate would have been like near 0 to start and the real bitcoin would have died when the corporate bitcoin forked.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:49:47
your implying the segwit lightning stuff is somehow advanced... interesting. Do you use it?
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:04:59
Again I didn't talk about value. Yet another attempt to deflect. Go ahead and open a nose, transfer some bitcoin around. Its painful. If your in the "digital gold" camp bitcoin is your horse. If you actually want a simple usable coin, well bitcoin is now very far from it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:37:43
So just increasing the block size would have solved all the problems that segwit did in a more elegant solution without fracturing the community? Yes I agree completely.
The real issue is WHY core devs chose to embrace blockstream. If you can sit there and type that nothing is fishy with what blockstream offered vs just increasing the block size, then I would like to know your justification for that.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:28:36
Hum. You might want to do some independent research for yourself on how this all went down. Thats just a fact.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:25:04
I just stated a fact.
"It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don’t have it are already obsolete."
Here is a satoshi quote. This is how it was intended to scale. SegWhat again?
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:39:49
give it a go. Then let me know what ya think.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:46:46
It doesn't go on forever, but you won't concede to an elegant solution that *was*Satoshi's original vision. And 32MB is the only max he saw.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:59:11
The definition I tried to explain? I quoted the inventor of bitcoin. You are using a straw man argument, so no need to respond. Obviously you have nothing on topic to add.

I click zec, scroll down, 1d data chart is not available.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:26:29
You don't know your history I guess.
@_date: 2018-08-29 14:33:00


Like segwit? EDA changes fewer lines then that. My statement holds.
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:11:23
Funny I thought bitcoin cash kept the same code, and bitcoin forked. As a matter of a fact....that is what happened.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:47:34
I actually like it a lot. I would like to see 2 things. 
1. I create a set of favorites, I'd like a unique hashed url "share" button. So I can grab a url and share that set.
2. I notice that you don't have day data yet? I'm interested in that level of detail and would suggest that should be the first loaded view.
3. Okay I know I said 2, but along the lines of  Also. I'd like to be able to grab an embed code that displays the selected favorites also. You can add a backlinks and use that as a inbound strategy also.
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:26:27
Bitcoin cash has more of the original core code then bitcoin, thats a fact. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:27:04
Because I'm sure he will win.........
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:22:58
vs seg...this was the clearly superior choice all along.

He has the warmth of an android. His congressional testimony came off like a sweat rag. I don't think he has a chance in hell. He is a nervous speaker, even with months of prep and a waiver of any potential for perjury.

If they did and then it took off, they would kill it shortly after.

Wow interesting question for this sub. Askalawyer.
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:00:54
Yes. Totally possible. Do people think ham radio is all analog comms or something? Morse code...Oh that was a good laugh. You can use dmr modes if you have capable sets.

I think they do it all to kill innovation and competition personally. They can't build organic compelling offerings on their own, and they don't want anyone else to. 
In short, they are an unregulated monopoly flexing absolute horizontal and vertical muscle. They restructured as alphabet in anticipation of all this.
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:57:44
So you don't support socialism. I stand corrected. I have yet to meet a remainer who is anti-socialism, but indeed my bad.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:04:46
Bitcoin is not a privacy coin.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:42:07
You seem to only be able to level personal attacks. I would expect that from a mentally incapacitated person that is pro-globalism, pro-socialism like yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:37:32
You present no arguement aside from a generic partisan statement. Truely, you are a politically motivated shill who did not bother to even listen to the podcast, or a lazy fool. 
Do you disagree with the free rider facts? If so state case.
Do you disagree with the national soverenity facts? If so state case.
Im guessing you are another armchair soft socialist nazi. Socialism has been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions in the 20th century, nothing you say to the contrary can change that. Fuck off.

I view my entire 7 years in crypto as a semi perminent state of disbelief. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:38:09
Containers with cash. Sure. Pics or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:06:22
Pftt. disbelief cuts both ways, not just the negative inference you are assuming.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:52:27
I don't know but post back when you find one. I think it's a great idea.

He is a socialist old turd. His days of doing anything meaningful have passed and he is on to shitting on ideas that threaten his love of socialist ideals and governmental control.

Is this the Democrat position on this?
