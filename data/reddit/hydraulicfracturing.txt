Do you really think that cryptos, one of the most volatile asset classes, would be considered a safe haven? No way!! People will flock to cash and bonds.

Effective blocksize increase which means that more bandwidth and storage is needed to run a full node, therefore hurting decentralization in the same manner as the other coin that we call a "shitcoin"

OTC fx swaps and forward contracts are both "zero sum" with counter parties and winners and losers. 
Here's a good way to demonstrate that wealth can be created through a rise in bitcoin price: imagine that the price of a bitcoin started at 0 and is now 100k. It rose from 0 to 100,000 in a nice and steady manner, and the price never went down. Anyone who owns bitcoin has increased their wealth. No one has less wealth than when we began, though--no one has less wealth now that bitcoin is worth 100k than they had when it was 0k. 
Even the people who sold bitcoins before the current 100k peak have more wealth than they had when bitcoin was worth 0k. The people who never had bitcoin have the same amount of wealth. 
Bitcoin is not a zero sum game. 
Similarly, imagine what happens when someone paints a painting that others think is worth $1 million. The painter sells the painting, taking $1 million in cash payment from a buyer. The buyer looses $1m cash, but now he has a painting that others still value at $1m. The buyer doesn't have $1 million worth of cash anymore, but now he has a painting worth $1 million. 
In this example $1 million has been created--this example isn't zero sum either.

You're only investing 5k... that isn't that much. You shouldn't waste money on an advisor.

How do you know it's going to keep going up?

You think this is arizonas motive? Even though capital gains taxes are payable to the federal government, not to the state of Arizona? 
Edit: actually, Arizona does have capital gains taxes.

In the context of financial decisions that require an advisor, that is peanuts.

the biggest problem, I think, it that they're only using one day of data.

Bitcoin is not a zero sum game, though.
Does it matter if you call bitcoin a currency or commodity? It's an asset

The fx markets are based on futures contracts with two counter parties--a winner and a loser. So the forex futures market is a zero sum game, if you ignore benefits of hedging foren exchange risk and stuff like that. 
That isn't what we're dealing with here with bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't a contract with two counter parties--it's an asset. And as the price of that asset has risen, wealth has been created. That $300bn of market cap bitcoin reached didn't mean that anyone lost $300bn. Nowhere did $300bn disappear to create the $300bn of bitcoin wealth.

How so? They're just getting paid with another asset, and converting it to USD within 24 hours.

I'm trying to say that in bitcoin trading no one has to lose for someone else to win. You're right that wealth is a bit arbitrary. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:03:44
It isn't a zero sum game. Lots of wealth was created when bitcoin prices rose. And lots of wealth was lost when prices crashed. 
The price of bitcoin is set by the price where the last transaction occurred. As long as transactions keep happening at higher and higher prices, wealth is created.

It isn't true that state income taxes and other forms of state taxes are used to pay for exclusively different things. 
In Arizona state income tax helps pay for schools, and in Texas property taxes help pay for schools. 
As to your point on paying interest on government debt--if a state has interest payments on debt, but they don't have a state income tax, they will pay the interest payments with another form of taxation

People who got their crypto stolen lost wealth, but the people who stole the crypto gained that wealth. So nothing has really been lost. That is zero sum. But as the price of bitcoin rose wealth was created. So bitcoin as a whole isn't zero sum. Winner should outweigh losers.
