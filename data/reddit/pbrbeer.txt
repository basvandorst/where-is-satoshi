I'm not so sure about that, i believe if you liquidate one asset to re-invest in another there is a period of time (i think it's ~~6 months, or a year~~, 45 days?) to make the transaction/investment, and not realize the capital gain yet.

Bingo! Considering the nature of the infinite number of ways to acquire coins, it basically comes down to the "honor system"

Nature, These rights can either be respected/protected, or violated, by others. Though it's a philosophical argument that many don't agree with. I happen to mostly subscribe to this school of thought though.

As little information as exists in this post, it's about the closest thing to the truth explaining the situation.... lol

It will be an incredible buying opportunity at that price

I'm a fan of Peter and have read most of his books and been following him since around 2006-7. But he is so fixated on gold and something being back by gold that it really clouds his ability to objectively consider: any alternative to it, or any point that Erik makes.
When he speaks about Gold backed online currencies he misses one major point, that they rely on some central entity that you must place 100% trust in, because they hold the gold that you "*think you*" own. So while your units may be backed by gold, that is meaningless if you can't hold your gold and store it in your own safe, because at any point in time they could shut down operations and run off with the backing commodity, or be shut down by a government. etc. Or could be over inflating the currency and deceptive about the amount in backing.
That is the value of bitcoin (that doesn't exist in a commodity backed online currency) where you can secure your own interest in the network in a manner that you choose: Storing with a 3rd party that you trust, Storing on your home computer with an encrypted wallet and backups, Storing in an offline wallet generated offline and stored physically, Storing offline with BIP 0038 encryption, etc, etc, etc, and never having to place trust and assurance onto a 3rd party. Erik trys to make this point but Peter dismisses it without even basic consideration.
Edit: I'm about halfway through the interview now, he also falls for the classic blunder that he likes to call others out on, **hindsight is 20/20**. When he is saying that it's riskier to invest $50 now than it was 4 years ago, yes being as hindsight shows us that it has been a huge gain over 4 years, but rewind 4 years no one knew for sure if bitcoin would ever gain traction. 
He also falls for another classic, and counter-intuitive to his position as a free market proponent, that because any amount of online-currencies could exist that bitcoin's demise could come from competition. He doesn't apply the same rules to it that a free-marketer would in all other areas of commerce and trade. That more competition leads to a larger and larger market, and a growing market with growing demand allocates more resources to fill that demand. Just as if Ford was the only company that ever built automobiles, or only IBM built computers, etc etc, competition grows and creates an even larger market for said technologies/sectors.

Hahahahahah this is one of the best responses i've ever read.

I respectfully disagree, when you give consumers choice in a new market it always helps the market expand. Do you think more people would be using personal computers if only Apple existed, and you were forced to use that product for personal computing? Do you think more people would buy cars if only Fords were available? Apply the same thing to phones, televisions, radios, etc, all of those markets kept expanding through competition and consumer choice. A currency/transaction network is no different. It doesn't need to be a monopoly to succeed, it's actually better if it's not. Giving consumers choice grows the base.
Let's not discount the possible of a bitcoin network flaw that has yet to be discovered or exploited, however rare that possibility may be given it's vast distributed &amp; open source nature, but none the less if it was the only crypto to exist then bringing it down could be catastrophic, if even for just a few hours.
People that actually see bitcoin as a currency over an investment should have no problem with competitors in the market.

Would the market demand 100 different types of gasoline? eventually the less popular crap would go out of business, someone would be in the market to refit vehicles to use the more popular fuels, and competitors would go where the money was for that particular blend of fuel.... 


This is actually how the problem solves itself, some third party figures out a way for everyone to communicate and get along, in the case of cryptos it's a site like BTC-e where you can trade directly from one protocol to another at a market rate.

You fell victim to one of the classic blunders, The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia", but only slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line"

This is probably the best explanation i have seen on the system. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:30:38
Exactly, as more and more money gets put it, it requires more and more amounts of buy orders coming in, or more and more amounts of sell orders going out to swing the market. 2 years ago someone buying $100,000 worth of coins would have spiked the price like mad, today it would barely cause a blip. It would only be 142 coins today, but probably ~10,000 coins back then.

Couldn't people just exchange for Euro VAT free, buy bitcoin via one of the exchanges that deals in Euro and skirt the rule?

Why does it have to be 'Versus', they can both exist and people can choose to use one, or the other, or both. Or neither..... Litecoin only helps Bitcoin in the long run, it's expanding the market for crypto-currency.

Personally i think it's pretty close minded to marginalize any of the other currencies out there. To declare that bitcoin is the only one that is worthwhile because no one will accept the others is completely missing the main purpose of why it was created in the first place. Which is to compete with archaic systems providing an alternative means of value transfer. The more consumer choice the better and larger any market becomes

I think Kiwi's point was that It would be very difficult to enforce considering the anonymous nature of bitcoins

Off site backup. Not a bad idea IF you actually encrypt your wallet first.

I'm sure there is probably somewhat of a market for it, but the first thing that came to mind after reading this:


was this:

A very well written, and respectful letter, one part stood out to me which immediately invoked a thought:


then leading to this:


One day in the future, gold will be able to be "copied" through refinements and advancements in fusion, and it will get to a point where it can be done cheaper than it is to buy or mine the gold, by the time it becomes possible, even if it is incredibly energy intensive, we may have harnessed cheap and bountiful energy through that same process of fusion.
Mathematics on the other hand, do not change, and one can simply raise the difficulty of the encryption algorithms to negate any useful attack based on the processing power at that time. 
Now, this may not happen for another 30 years, 50 years, who knows, but it will happen at some point as science and technology continue accelerating in their discoveries. At which point what is the more secure and valuable currency?
