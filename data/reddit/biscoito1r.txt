I've predicted something like this in the past, sooner or later another crypto will take a good amount of BTC's value and then the community will wake up, I hope it won't be too late.

I also check his little brother's price. I'm glad the btc community stopped bullying the poor kid after becoming the guinea pig of the community.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:41:01


when I broke even around 700 and I sold most of them, and then around 1400 because I was gonna wait for it to go down so I could buy them cheaper and make a profit, and I'm still waiting for it to happen.

I grew up in Brazil during the 90's. And I remember how crazy supermarkets would get on the 1st day of the month. Someone would get paid and had to spend it all on the first day because by the end of the month the money would've been worth about 3 times less.

I wonder what Bolsonaro's views on bitcoin are. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:47:38
All because it is illegal to crack an encryption no matter how weak it is according to the DMCA or its European counterpart. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:09:02
The file uploading folks usually accept bitcoins, and you can also buy a hacked account on the deepweb with bitcoins, not taking bitcoins is basically their loss.
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:51:31
They send the bitcoin to the scammer's bitcoin wallet. It is kinda like the western union, or the itunes scam but using bitcoins instead. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 23:17:36
The was a dude that had a bitcoin startup like coinbase that was arrested for allowing people to send money to darkweb address, I can't remember the guy's name now but it was well talked about a couple years ago.

This is some scary stuff. When I first opened an account, I wanted to use Bank Boston, my cousin was the one taking me there. She ended up taking me to First Massachusetts Bank instead which was located next door, and I just opened an account with them because I was already there. Today I'm gladder than ever that she made this "mistake". Oh for the youngsters out there, Bank Boston was eventually bought buy BoA after being bought buy some other banks.

If people still feel the need to sell their bitcoins by 2040 it means bitcoin has failed.

Why can't east timor do it ? They have no currency of their own besides coins, and they are all fussy regarding what types of dollar bills they take, like no one wanted to take my 2 dollar bills, not even the Government.
