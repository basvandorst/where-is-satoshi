Normally takes a bit of time to show you hashing ... at least 10 mins or so ... maybe longer.

Starts to get more complicated .... 
That really is the realm of professional advice ... just substitute Bitcoin for Gold and ask an accountant .. same thing (No VAT on Bitcoins or Gold)

Depends on our provider - in the UK I can set a "anti slamming" on my account - so it can not be transferred or a new sim ordered or activated with my 2FA on my provider ... if you have time - access to the phone or sim without any further protection ANYTHING is possible.

Simply turn off "multi device" under settings and then Authy is just like Authenticator. Always use a pin in Authy and if you ever want to change phones simply enable multi device - transfer - then disable it again.

So long as you can show you have tried to pay the correct amount of tax ... so .. say you have not kept records / lost records / computer crash etc ... traded on and off exchanges - some records but not all.
1 - Look back at previous trades and the price of bitcoin
2 - Take an average profit margin and apply to the ones missed (off exchange)
3 - Get previous trades from exchanges and work out profit
4 - Then if you show what you made with the data collected and apply the same average to the "lost" or forgotten records... you should be ok
Now .. the tax man may always question your calculations but in my experience so long as you have paid what THEY deem fair ... which in turn if you can show genuine calculations to reach that fair amount they have been more than helpful and willing to accept.
It us when you try to hide things .... then they get nasty.

"Is it unethical to lie about your business activity in order to get an account opened"
Well ... there are lies and there are ways of saying things ... almost like a politician. We have exactly the same problem in the UK. 
Is there a description that you can use which is truthful but does not mention Bitcoin (Which is what they seem to get hung up on ..) for example when I opened a new business account and I said I was trading in commodities and litecoin it was opened within a day ..... technically truthful, I did not mention the LTC deals were instantly converted to BTC .....

Also ... your allowance is each year ( if I am not mistaken? ) I think it carries ... I may stand corrected here ....
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:42:50
It is simply treated as a personal asset in the UK, so just like if you bought a car and sold it for a profit AND the profit is more than your personal allowance ... tell them in January on your tax return.

Could use a VPN service so it always seems to come from the same IP address
