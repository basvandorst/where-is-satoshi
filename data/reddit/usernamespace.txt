This is the case only for BIP32 keys, if I know your master public key and a child private key I can derive your master private key and thus all the child private keys.

I didn't know that armory was deriving the keys like that, this makes it incompatible with bip32.

Bravo. Now go and remove all non deterministic built wallets.

Correct, segwit outputs do not appear in incompatible wallets.

The seed everybody is talking about is in reality the BIP39 standard. It has a feature of setting a pass phrase to recreate the private keys. You could use that in addition to what others mentioned, just remember that the pass phrase cannot change and that is needed to restore the wallet with the seed. Practice restoring the wallet before sending coins (you should get the same addresses). Like this you could leave the seed with a friend or family as a backup, without them being able to steal your coins, just remember to create a new seed once you cross the border.
Use this tool on an offline computer to test the recovery process

Nice idea of integrating BIP44, BIP49 and the new "Bech32" BIP84 in one account. I wonder how other wallets will tackle this. Also tried it with the bip39 HTML tool and it generates the same addresses.

It doesn't matter because you still have to keep the transaction forever to prove the block chain (unless we add to the block the merkle root hash of the UTXO set).

Additionally it doesn't spam the bitcoin block  chain. It seems that they changed to bitcoin for marketing purposes rather for technical reasons (like the hash power distribution).
