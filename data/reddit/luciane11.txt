What you mean confused? Is a medicine metadone is the name . And you can quit on what you still take today. That’s my point, get it? Being addicted is not a easy life.

Only private! I just said ‘try to offer a seller your crypto’and you will see that he will accept it. You can not say that Romanians never heard or it is a small portion of people that heard about it. Like you, you are here , maybe like many others. So, when you buy something on România just try to pay in crypto and you’ll see for your self. Depending where you living also,you can’t live in some remote place and want a technology that it is still new in your ‘hole’(sorry not trying to offend)
And I make this statements because it works for me and I have bought important thinks with crypto and even paying rent for my daughter in crypto. Take care!

Do you want to avoid taxes? I will buy it from ya. Interested? I guess you will send me my BTC after I will send you my money , right? You scammer ! A guy with some much money don’t come here to ask such questions! And if you buy it in 2013 I think till now you must be doxed about crypto in general. Me, small investor from 2017 and it did not pass a single day not reading something new about or learn stuff. And you, Reddit account 1day , millionaire , come to sit talking with us poor people? How come your grace has given us this opportunity , to speak with ya(sarcastic)      
SCAMMER! 
Ps. If not feel  free to show as prof and I can teach ya gratis how you should do.

Crypto spender here, True indeed! You can buy cars you can rent a flat even buy a house with crypto! It is true we don’t have a crypto education like the most of the world , but we keep up with the trend. I can confirm that I buy staff with crypto and living almost every day from (change to fiat) 
For the Romanian who are saying that it is not true maybe they don’t dig enough
{{When you try(if;)to buy a house just try and ask the man that is selling if he accept crypto;} You will be amazed by how many dealers close such deals};

The way that he explains the situation round btc excellent . Nice work! Now we can at least imagine the mess that is happening inside(don’t maters if right or wrong) and a lot of users are still sleeping . 
I read an article that they will split again creating bitcoin gold . 
I wonder why we keep worry ourselves for the block size when still we have plenty of space in-use???For the future ?the future is here already 
I support dev core team for the great work that they do.Miners want more and more and they panic when they hear about upgrading coz true,they will lose the advantage (cheating for my point)

Why do you need to write dirty words? I did not edit it , it is like you see .  I am not from US or UK, it is not my language that I speak every day, if I did mistakes you can learn me by telling me where I write wrong, if not just don t read! 
I try to help some others that have accounts on spectrocoin . That’s all! PACE

LN(lighting network) will Take fee’s! They said that they want to get the miners out, but they will put in the place of them LN!onother fee that we don t need!greedy people! Instead of this it whas more simple to make blocks bigger! Satoshi said that when you need just increase the blocks size! Fork is about them pushing the users(with no consens)to the second chain ,Segwit , and then is not bitcoin is altcoin! We will see, but make me think about going to BitcoinCash!big blocks , fast transactions, small fee’s! WTF! Pace!
