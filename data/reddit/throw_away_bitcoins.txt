I bought in at ~$10, because of a searing hatred for the federal reserve and the global fiat financial system.
I was a skeptic at the time of my purchases, but only because of any potential programming flaws, not the inherent design or concept of the system. This skepticism has faded with my own personal use and increasing merchant adoption rates.
In all honesty, I am not the least bit surprised the price is on par with gold. In fact, back when it was $5-15, people were making posts saying:
"bitcoin will go to $10,000 each"
"The bitcoin to gold ratio is 90:1. I expect that ratio to reverse in the future" (meaning 90 oz of gold will buy 1 bitcoin)
Most of the early adopters knew where this was headed. The true believers, at least. Still, seeing the price seems surreal, especially when we used to throw around 0.1 like it was candy.
I was damn-near broke when I invested too, and now I am sitting on 6 figures. It is possible I will become a millionaire in 2014. 
Like others here, I am very cash poor and bitcoin rich. My friends think I'm bullshitting them when I say I can buy a house in cash. I've been advocating bitcoin for 12+ months, showing them step-by-step how to purchase some, but it has fallen on deaf ears. They're still scraping money together to pay rent. It is sad, really. They still have full faith in USD and laugh at my "fake internet money". I think the concept of competing currencies is simply beyond the understanding of most people. Hell, most people can't even wrap their brains around financial markets.

2 years isn't quick enough for a get-rich-quick scheme? =)
