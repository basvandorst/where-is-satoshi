!RemindMe 1 year
Hopefully the people who are down today on BTC are significantly up a year from now.

Doesn't Kraken display in Euro? Are you sure that is not what you are seeing instead of an actual huge USD difference?

Instant sales/buys that you can do like every minute if you wanted to? How do you do that? Any tutorials you can point me to? 
I looked into using coinbase, but I think they put a delay on everything.

Thank you, I agree after some thought!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:46:27


Ahhh, good point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:04:06
How is that more proof? Because of what Drgoldsz22 said in response, that too many people are buying in without understanding it? Or did you have more reason behind your statement?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:44:44
Heheh. 
Cool, thanks for the info. I forgot about the fees. GDAX has no fees, though, maybe?
So do people just stick to the "globally declared" value of BTC whenever they're selling/buying it, or do people actually try to haggle with one another?
Also, how can you tell that you've purchased authentic BTC? Is there a verification process *before* the sale is made, or is every exchange a risk?

Thank you very much!

Thoughts on Litecoin? It seemed to surge recently as well

what platform do you use? you use bittrex? what coins do you trade?

Real question, what happens if the hardware wallet breaks? It's all gone, right? So then, wouldn't an online wallet be more 'secure'? I mean, if an online company loses your money by getting hacked or their servers going down, wouldn't they be held responsible so you could get your BTC back from them via suing or whatever? Whereas if your hardware wallet breaks/is lost, it's all your responsibility.

Thank you!

Super useful info, thank you.
Last questions, since you say every exchange is a risk, do people have... 'usernames' on the market with maybe a reputation attached to them (sort of like eBay)? Or how do you most minimize risk when buying/selling Bitcoin with a stranger, IOW? Also it's fine if you just want me to Google this stuff. I know these have to be super basic questions, reeeeee.

What's the benefit to automatic vs manual?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:33:11
Why not just $1200 upfront, out of curiosity?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:56:08
Or a paper wallet, right? (real question)
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:08:10
Surely you will get the Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:34:04
What does a "pump and dump" mean in the context you're using? I keep seeing people use this phrase and I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:53:12
Sadly, I'm not able to make an educated decision there. It sounds like you and your dad have a close relationship, though, so I'm sure it'll be a fun time regardless of what you go with. :]

You are a sweetheart. I agree that you deserve much better out of life. You seem like a fighter. I hope you're able to overcome all of this and that you get the best treatment you can. Wishing you the best.
