The history of bitcoin with multiple cycles of boom and bust since its inception. You can’t kill it, it only comes back stronger. 
The upcoming bull run will MELT PEOPLES FACES OFF. 
There will still be people buying the top before it shrinks back again and people will proclaim bitcoin dead. You’re looking at the global reserve currency in the next 10 years. Especially with the pending atomic bomb sized global financial crisis to make 2008 look like a balloon popping in comparison.

ATH- It really is a happy new year - moreover It's the start of the future. Bitcoin will be soon be universally adopted like every other technology, insurance companies will fall as their funding model crashes (unlike automated cars), clean water through desalination will be open to all, current farming methods will be seen as savage and wasteful by 2030... 
Don't buy the dip. Celebrate the hope for the future! And just hope you have a job that won't be easily automated by a program or a bot, and damn well hope you aren't the last poor bastard to the cryptocurrency party. 
When this long overdue emancipation of the human race does happen, please let's just agree to make it a better version than it has been previously!
Happy new year to all of Reddit, and the Bitcoin and crypto community. To the moon!!!

Why the hell would they want a currency that serves no novel purpose and is not accepted by anyone as a form of wealth storage or payment? Bitcoin Cash (BCC) serves no role in crypto that isn't already being better served by another coin e.g. BTC or LTC

I'm not being slow to understand. I'm asking if there is an answer to a question I had. 
The answer is clearly "no there is no way to answer that at this moment". To insult my intelligence is totally unnecessary but I hope you've polished your ego and made yourself feel very smart, mr big man

This is a very shortsighted crappy point. 40% of the worlds population are entirely unbanked. As in, there’s no chase or Barclays Bank on the high street - that high street doesn’t exist. Internet connectivity is far quicker to instigate than a high street banking model and at much reduced cost. 
As the traditional hegemonic powers allow Africans to connect (which is a given to improve customer user base to grow for funding of global communication companies), the explosion of smartphones will be far more rapid than that seen in the West. Two to five years rather than fifteen. Cheaper electricity is becoming rapidly abundant and able to be rolled out to remote villages in hours at low prices (see Mozambique renewables) 
Africa and Asia will skip traditional banking models for crypto as it becomes cheaper and more accessible which is inevitable. 
The predicted population growth of African nations will ensure they are a leading global power within 30-40 years. 
Look to the mid term future and you’ll see how much room crypto banking has to grow and just how fertile that market is likely to be...

Satoshi is long gone. Those genesis blocks will never be moved. Maybe Hal Finney. Maybe Nick Szabo was smart enough to squirrel later blocks away. Doesn’t matter what happened to Satoshi - he’s changed the world.

Agreed -trezor is great, I have one myself. But a little pricey for someone with a not so high amount of crypto. I wouldn't spend out on one until you've bought enough crypto to make it worthwhile to own a cold wallet that costs over $100

Surely buying frivolous items such as swanky houses, Lambos and Savile row suits leads to distribution of wealth via capitalism. Socialism doesn't work. Fiat capitalism doesn't work.

You get BCC (BCH) as a function of protocol rather than through some generosity scheme of the exchanges. Many exchanges "will not support" i.e. Will not give you your due BCH as they are using the private keys that they own (as you do not if you keep on an exchange) and making € money

50p! Low value?! As an Englishman I don't know whether to agree with you or be offended!
It's crazy to me that we have to change money when we cross imaginary lines on a continent. FIAT is dead. It's a globalised economy, and we need value that can't be diluted by QE and forgery. Bitcoin will rise and rise as the global economy stutters to a halt, and I've a strong feeling that's really not far off...

What if Satoshi IS the government? If the governments of the world can overthrow governments with subterfuge and skullduggery then I don't think it's out of the realms of possibility that they could create and then hoard and promote an alternative currency to regain power from fiat banking  systems
