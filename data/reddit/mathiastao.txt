Our first film "Bitcoins in Argentina" has lots of attention and tells how Bitcoins are being used by Argentinians to avoid inflation. What do you think our next film should be about?

1000+ views since release. Viewers are mainly from the US and Argentina.

Unfortunately not at the moment - If there is enough attention from Argentina and other Spanish-speaking regions, we will definitely work on a subtitled version!
