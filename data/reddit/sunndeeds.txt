This will probably never confirm and it should drop out in few weeks and it should be back in your wallet (assuming your wallet doesn't keep rebroadcasting it). If you are ready to spend like 15usd for a second semi-high fee transfer here is one way to do it: 
1. Go to your multibit wallet and find the private key for your public 1JWJJewQ9nhyPTrPdL3GAahTVa9dv7hQfS address (under tools i suppose).
2. download and install electrum from electrum.org 
3. When creating a wallet choose Import addresses or private keys and enter your private key
4. Send your available balance with atleast 400 sat/byte to a new address. (you can send all to 1JWJJewQ9nhyPTrPdL3GAahTVa9dv7hQfS but there is better options)
* Even the new versions of multibit are not good enough
* You should get your 1JWJJewQ9nhyPTrPdL3GAahTVa9dv7hQfS address empty becouse it contains also bcash and bitcoin gold so it's safer to empty that address first on btc chain, before giving the private key of it to some shady altcoin client
* You should get a segwit address so next time sending from it is a lot cheaper
* You can create a second electrum wallet while the other is running, just click file / new and create a segwit wallet, write that seed down and send your coins to the new wallet (electrum is using the newest and cheapest segwit address format bech32 and many other wallets are not yet able to send to those addresses so if you know you should be receiving coins in the next few months, this might be a bad idea)
* if you don't want electrum segwit wallet, get a new receiving address from your multibit or choose a totally different wallet like armory with p2sh segwit

To me it seems like you didnt transfer 0.045, you only transferred 0.028 and btcmarkets just batched your tx with someone elses 0.0159 tx totaling 0.045
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:36:44
You used 14 inputs and paid about 7 usd for every legacy input. 2 of those inputs were worth less than 1 usd and 2 were worth less than 5 usd so you spent more btc to transfer them than if you would have just left them unused. You also wasted some precious blockchain space for those :) I dont know why wallets even allow to spend inputs worth less than fees without atleast asking. But now you have your 4btc in a single input shiny new segwit address and a lot cheaper to spend next time so cheers for that! :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:23:43
Yes, nothing required, instantly cheaper tx. Fees might look the same for example 100sat/byte but the tx will be smaller in bytes so the total cost will be smaller.

I don't know exactly how it works but what I have understood is that: If both parties agree on closing a channel, it will be closed instantly and will be in blockchain. If only other side tries to close the channel it will have a wait period of something like 24h so Bob will have 24h to broadcast the newer state which Alice has also signed so it will be obvious that Alice is trying to cheat and will get a penalty.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:04:41
Seems like the wallet keeps rebroadcasting the transaction to the network. You have a lot of options but here is few:
1. Do not open the blockchain.info wallet for few weeks so it might stop trying to rebroadcast the tx
2. Download electrum and create a wallet with the private key of public address 19dA4bf5te8VFSqL7xcFfthS5zxAo1zpyi and just send what you want with fees that electrum suggests (this is a double spend and might work even before the tx is forgotten in the network)
2. Create a wallet in electrum with the private key of 1NxeqiebMBdRTkXqXQPMsGbThmT1oXeSZ5 (where the money hasnt yet arrived) but you can still spend it from there but you must do this with very high fees so it will pay for the older tx also (atleast 50usd for now so 1/3 of the money
also please have a look at my older post that explains some basics about fees etc 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:51:40
Yes, spending from a segwit address is cheaper than regular, doesn't matter where you send it.
If you would like to understand more, please have a look at my older post 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:56:07
Maybe the wallet doesn't show everything spendable becouse a fee is needed to make the next transfer

Yes - First coins were released about 9 years ago.

I have understood that old addresses can never be signed with schnorr but when the time comes, we will have a new addresstype that can be signed with schnorr. So in future you will hopefully have a schnorr enabled address which can have 100 inputs and can be signed with one signature.

ok thanks, I'll edit that, I somehow thought that ln channel opening/closing transactions would have more of the discounted witness data on average than "normal" segwit transactions.

One known example is the mtgox bankcruptsy trustee that sold about 40 000 btc at average price 10k/per btc so about 400 million dollars in about one month. It might have affected the price a little but i would say that you can sell 10 million dollars per day easily.

For example the android eclair that is still in beta is currently a spend only LN wallet (receive must be on chain). If you open a channel to your favourite coffee shop (or any other node that is connected) you can start buying your coffees on the LN network. If for some reason the coffee shop publishes an older state, it means you get money back. Yes, you must be online to make the LN transfer but you would need to be online to send a normal tx also. And the receiver must be online in both cases to know that you have paid.

Adding nodes doesn't help scaling. Basically the problem of scaling is that everyone processes at the same speed (or as fast as the slowest nodes) if we increase blocksize we lose a lot of nodes and a lot of decentralision. Soon we could be at the mercy of a few isp.
All is great and advancing fine. Lightning Network will solve many things. Also when we had full blocks for awhile, it forced exhanges to start use batching (using the blockchain more efficiently) etc and we have many more upgrades coming like schnorr signatures and mast.

Bitcoin blockchain is now 200gb and can grow about 100gb a year with current rules. Blocksize will probably be raised in a few years so it's impossible to know exactly but i would guess that a 1 TB drive will be ok for 5 years and a 4 TB drive would last 10 years. 
Also you don't need to store the full blockchain to keep your node running (pruning) then you just won't be one of the nodes feeding the blockchain to new nodes.

Hi! BTCPay might be the solution. The most important question is how fast he needs the received btc to be exchanged to fiat?
1. If he needs the btc to be changed to fiat instantly he would need a merchant solution like bitpay or coinbase merchant but both of these are pushing altcoin agendas and blacklisting "bad" coins etc etc. and currently there is no good all-in-one solution that could be recommended.
2. If it is OK to just receive the BTC and then manually convert it to fiat when needed (for example monthly transferred to an exchange and withdrawn in fiat) I can recommend BTCPay. They even support Lightning Network.
3. I believe that in a few months we will start seeing LN enabled exchanges and it should become easy and very low fee to setup an BTCPay server that instantly transfers the btc to and exchange with a few API calls and market sells it.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:09:10
The blocksize will be increased in the future. It already was increased as a part of segwit update which made it possible to increase the limit but also keep all the old software working while they plan a safe upgrade. For example it took coinbase over 6 months to update to segwit. People are very slow and unwilling to risk a working system.
But today we have no congestion on the mempool and lightning coming soon so there is very little reason to increase the blocksize which would mean much more centralization. Also would need more resources to start accepting btc with own node as a shop etc.
You can find some more info from my old post a few months ago

It has been created by a LN hater but seems like there is not much active negative propaganda going on so some discussions are pretty legit. r/thelightningnetwork was created by someone to be a bit more positive subreddit but it is pretty dead. 
I wish someone with good understanding and connections would create one more subreddit to be "the" ln subbreddit. I have heard that stark has many times asked the devs to not waste time on PR until LN works but i guess we are getting pretty close to the turning point.

Bitcoin can't be mined with GPU or CPU, you will make about 0.01usd /day mining bitcoin. You can make money mining alts and if you want, you can convert alts to bitcoin. Just google "what to mine". 
Nicehash was a great and easy tool that used your hashing power for whatever most profitable and converted everything to btc, they got hacked and lost a lot of customer money, they are back now but I don't know if they are trustworthy.

* 1. Passwords etc might be for mining accounts etc and you might not need any of those. Simplest solution might be installing bitcoin core and overwriting the new wallet.dat with your old one and if it happens to be password protected, it will ask for it, but please read and learn a lot before you try anything.
* 2. If you have control to some bitcoin, please do not tell people how much. You can explain a lot to relatives etc even you would say you found 25 btc.
* 3. If the bitcoin amount is anything over 100 btc you need an investment plan so you can live happily ever after with profits only. For example if you would invest 5 million usd to an ETF through your bank, the average profit yearly would be around 6% and if you would use only half of that, you should have money for taxes and risks and the invested capital should still keep rising enough to compansate for inflation. So with 5 million you would have something like 12,5k monthly to your account taxes paid. Forever.
* 4. Selling some bitcoin for usd. I would contact some big exchanges and ask for help. You might have problems with authorities becouse they want to know how you got your coins. So there might be some value if you had documents from the exchange that "mister x has provided private keys for btc that last moved 8 years ago and now has sold x amount" or something like that.

New wallet = new seed
And of i remember correctly, the first wallet you create is called default and the wallet1 should be a newer one.
Only explanation that comes to mind is that maybe when you first installed electrum you tested the program first and didn't save the seed of the default wallet and when you decided to start using electrum you created another wallet which is called wallet1 and you have the seed for this. Then when you thought you created a new wallet a while ago, which should have been a third wallet called wallet2, you actually didn't but you somehow opened the first "test" wallet. If this is the case the password might be something simple that you use "everywhere" if it was only for testing.

for example 4mb blocks would push the average propagation time for average miner from 17 seconds to 76 seconds. Unless you happen to have hundreds of nodes in you own LAN network with multiple fiber connections going outside, this is bad. A huge miner (like bitmains own mining operation) would have a minute more time to find a block against a smaller miner.

Sure, but it is a bit hard to say as I don't know how big space, where etc :)
More space is usually better, if they can heat up freely a space over 100m2 (~1000 sq ft) you might be fine. (depending where and how it's built, how much air is changed etc)
If the room gets too hot, you need to add ventilation or air conditioning. Ventilation brings dust, cooling doesn't but it uses more energy.
Simplest air conditioning is a window mounted model: 
Or a split unit looks better but is more expensive and needs a special guy to install: 
There are also portable air conditioning units that also changes air so it is hard to say would it work in your situation.
Simplest ventilation is to open a window :) but next might be to add some kind of fan to blow hotter air out (suction as high as possible) and then just have an opening somewhere with a simple filter for dust for replacing the air.

An average refrigerator with a 200w compressor (and cop 6) might be able to push out 1200w of heat (3400btu), but your miners are over 5000w (or 17 000btu)

Great to have a new miner here!
As said before you really need a safe wallet that is also easy to use. 
As mentioned in other comments a hardware wallet is a simple choice. For example ledger nano is ~70eur.
Second best choice is to use the mentioned software wallets but I wouldn't trust even those on an average windows computer that is also used to watch porn. 
If you happen to have an old laptop, just install some linux distro to it (for example linux mint) and use it only for a software wallet like electrum. The wallet will generate a 12 word recovery seed for every wallet you generate so backup is really easily written on paper.
And I really hope you choose to support segwit over bitcoin unlimited. Segwit would enable lightning network (which would make instant transactions possible) and many other great things. 
Bitcoin networks current capacity is 6 transfers / second. Segwit would make 100 000 / sec possible by transferring most of the small transactions off chain. Bitcoin unlimited would just increase block size and if we would make it 4 times what it is now, we would be at 24 transfers / second and small miners would already suffer vs big miners becouse it's harder for a small miner to push the block to network fast enough.
