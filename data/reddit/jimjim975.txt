Get another wallet app, and put the seed in.

you uh.. can't ban crypto. They can ban the exchanges that are run in your country, but you can still buy and hodl bitcoin if you please...
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:38:37
well then you did it wrong...

Not mycelium, any wallet.

3.0 is still a b average. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:43:58
Because it's a small amount of money now. But in a couple months it will triple or quadruple.

Then how else are you going to cold store your bitcoin, other than using a hardware or paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:38:26
It's the complete opposite of a Fiat currency. It's decentralized and doesn't rely on any government or higher entity regulating it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:08:03
A Fiat currency is a currency that is not backed by any physical item. A Fiat is also considered legal tender by a country, whereas bitcoin is not backed by any government. That's the point.

Are you retarded?

See: rule number 1 of crypto. Never buy more than you're willing to lose.

Bitcoin and crypto currencies for that matter cannot be explained fully in the span of an hour. It takes days to weeks of researching to even get close to having a mastery grasp on it.

Maybe next time dont be a dipshit and look over what you're doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:41:57
