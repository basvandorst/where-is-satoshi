The crypto currency revolution is not for the dinosaur generation. They have had their time and it’s time for them to be put out to pasture.

I think it’s time to start putting some money behind lobbyists in Washington for when the regulation war on bitcoin begins. It would help to have some politicians on our side.

The technology is the thing that gives bitcoin its value..... and it made me a lot of money as a fortunate side effect.

It gives me hope when I see posts like this where noobs actually take the time to understand what bitcoin actually is and how it could completely revolutionize the banking system
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:55
Can we just all from now on fully agree to call it bcash for eternity. Clearly something weird went on yesterday but we drew a line in the sand around $16500 and held. All I can say is ‘is that it?’. The only major problem bitcoin has right now is our transaction fee and volume. Once we solve that bcash is dust. Bcash.... it’s our turn next.

Supposedly the NSA knows Satoshi’s identity as they feared bitcoin might have been developed as a financial weapon by some rogue nation. The story goes that they are keeping his identity a secret as they respect his desire to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:07:39
It’s all about blocks. Our block is 1mb every 10 minutes. So all transactions that get processed get put in that block. If there is an overflow then there is a backlog cos it gets bundled with the next block cos that block can only take 1mb worth and so forth. Segwit has helped(a little) but major exchanges aren’t supporting segwit addresses so we are all praying that the lightning network will unclog this massive backlog of transactions. I’m a miner and I do appreciate this extra transaction fee however I believe in future growth of bitcoin. We are experiencing exponential growth and need to adapt accordingly while keeping the system decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:02
I started mining at the end of last year. I was lucky enough to snag some antminers from bitmain and now have 490ths of hashrate. It really felt good to put my 2 weeks notice in at my job once I had enough saved to get me through 6 months of living if Bitcoin crashed. Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto you’ve changed my life!!!

So. Let me say this again. I mine from a hydropower plant directly which actually produces a surplus of power. So how am I an energy negative????
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:23
Everybody that just got their bcash should sell right now.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:07:49

Someone gets it. Every transaction is open to everybody at any time. The whole premise of Blockchain and an open ledger
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:21
I’ve since these dips so many times. I just laugh when everybody starts freaking out. Bitcoin has only one major problem now and that’s the transaction fees. Once that problem is solved then how much do you think a bitcoin will be worth. Think long term not short term people.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:02:23
Very high chance we will get a major dip but I don’t think it’ll crash to 2k. Only way that will happen is if the government shuts down the exchanges and there’s a very slim chance of that
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:21:17
Yeah I’m also getting bombarded with people wanting me to explain bitcoin to them. I make them take me to lunch or dinner so I at least get something for my time. I’m happy to teach but a free lunch or dinner definitely helps

Don’t know why but I love this meme
@_date: 2018-09-16 04:56:07
Best way to answer this question is read the book ‘debt: the first thousand years’ you’ll come to realize that everything comes down to a ledger of who owes what. Bitcoin is the the best ledger mankind has ever created so far. Hope that helps
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:42:33
Yes do it so it takes 2.5btc out of circulation so the price will increase by a fraction of a percent

I fear that there might be another possible terror attack where an investigation reveals that bitcoin was used to finance it. The governments will use that as an excuse to make it illegal. I don’t know if bitcoin could survive that

@_date: 2018-08-08 04:58:57
There is no easy way to making money. Personally I believe in the tech so I’ve resigned myself to going down with the ship because peer to peer wealth transfer with no 3rd party involved is how it should be done. What you need to ask yourself is why you have money in bitcoin and what you want out of it. Kinda comes down to how big your balls are. Right now you sound weak as fuck... you should sell
@_date: 2018-05-23 04:05:04
If you are using a gpu to mine then it is the equivalent of using a teaspoon to mine gold. ASIC’s are the digital excavators of the bitcoin mining world. Hope that analogy helps you out

@_date: 2018-05-23 17:52:33
No it’s because of the Chinese New Year, Ramadan, whales dumping and an inverted unicorn horn has formed on the bitcoin 30 day chart.

It’s because of the Chinese New Year and the double inverse unicorn double shoulder pattern on the chart
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:59:43
The point I’m trying to make here is that this is a very risky game. You shouldn’t be gambling with money you can’t afford to lose. I sympathize with OP but he made the choice to gamble on the price of BTC going up. How me commenting on that on how it makes me lazy and dumb eludes me

It's never this easy to make so much money so quickly. Expect some huge price shocks in the future. Everyone is talking only about the price going up which is never a good sign. I'm not being negative as I see Bitcoin with a bright future so long as central banks and govts don't attack it. The future of bitcoin is going to be very interesting. To all fellow HODLers like me I respect you and salute you and let's keep making shit tons of money!!!

@_date: 2018-11-14 21:10:35
This looks like a great buying opportunity because the only reason the price is going down is because of the loonies over at bitcoin cash having their silly little war of the retarded forks. When the dust settles bitcoin will be stronger and bitcoin cash will be broken into two pointless coins

You’re a symptom of the utter despair in the cryptocurrency world right now. Fundamentally Bitcoin has never been stronger than it is now. The only thing that’s changed is investor sentiment so if you’re a smart person that believes in the revolutionary tech aspect of Bitcoin then what side of the fence do you want to be on? Only you can answer that.
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:11:55
For some weird reason I have this gut feeling that bitcoin is going higher very soon. Hope I’m right
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:51:45

There goes another set of weak hands. Bye

Welcome to the HODL brotherhood. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 03:25:24
Can I have some bitcoin please?
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:59:15
Confirmed douche bag then too 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:27:33
Thanks for your wise words oh bitcoin prophet. Bullshit... no one knows what the price is going to do.  
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:18:14
 Very nice
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:42:11
You’re such a pussy
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:20:39
That was good
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:15:54
If someone figures out how to do this I'd gladly donate
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:12:16
We will all be dead and bitcoin will still be around I just have no idea what its value will be
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:24:53
Can we do a gif where he's off the rails and falling he's passing clouds??

Be greedy when others are fearful. I smell fear on you
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:40:40
I didn’t flinch... I may have yawned at all the FUD though
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:44:58
I heard the NSA knows who the real Satoshi is but is keeping his identity secret as they respect his anonymity.
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:43:21
If technical analysis works and is a predictor of future prices then that is a classical morning star formation which means a huge price increase is coming up. That is if you believe technical analysis actually works 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:44:50
Oh Fuck off

I bought using bcc but it was the bcc I got from the fork. Figured it was the best way to use it instead of having to sign up with a new exchange to offload it.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:12:02
It's going to go higher. The Jamie/China hangover has passed
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:15:05
It's only a matter of time before some big player steps in the ASIC arena with Bitmain. I hope it's sooner than later
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:31:09
I hope we blow past $5000 soon. That will be our answer to Jamie Dimon's silly remarks about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:23:33
Maybe he knows someone at the NSA who allegedly knows Satoshi’s identity. Yeah it’s not Craig
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:57:23
Finally someone posts something that isn't a meme and makes sense to the entire community. Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:50:16
Price is going to go apeshit in November when the hardfork circle jerk occurs. There will be lots of buying opportunities
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:19:04
More FUD... yawn
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:31:09
I hope we blow past $5000 soon. That will be our answer to Jamie Dimon's silly remarks about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:02:50
Price discovery. No one knows what a bitcoin is truly worth. If it survives the next ten years the price will stabilize 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:06:47
This reminds me of Churchill’s speech in Britain’s darkest hour of world war 2... “we shall never surrender”
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:28:09
I suggest block Friday should be the day that the first bitcoin transaction occurred which is January 12th
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:04:13
Listen assholes. I’m a miner and I’m prepared to mine on core at a loss till the difficulty catches up. I believe in the core chain and not all us miners are greedy assholes. Changing pow is not a good idea at all
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:00:53
Lol. Just wait till it crashes and all the weak hands start freaking out. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:04:43
My guess is that Kleiman is Satoshi. I’ve speculated this a year ago
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:28:47
I can totally relate to this post. Most times when I try to explain bitcoin to people I just get the confused, lost, no idea what’s going on look back. Yeah it’s frustrating.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:05:00
Thank you bitcoin. I’ve officially quit my shitty job and am a full time cryptocurrency miner. Freedom from the shitty fiat slave system is now possible!!
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:35:41
I’m with you on Slush. I got a lot more miners coming. I’ll be tripling my hashrate just before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:30:12
I’ve mined 14 coins so far. Long way to go
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:04:08
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:31:22
Look bank now I am the bank
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:21:15
People bought more miners at the high and waited for them to be shipped. Once the price plunged their miners arrived so they plugged them in. Right now the next difficulty prediction is 0.67%. It’s flatlining cod the profit margins are tiny or a loss
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:48:47
If that happens it truly will show that the powers that be really don’t want us to have freedom. That will be a sad day.

Hal Finney did a lot of work for bitcoin but he is not Satoshi
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:55:49
500 ths of hashpower. Yeah I quit my job and it feels great to have machines printing me money all day. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:43:31
Pretty simple. If you’ve invested more than you can lose and you don’t have the balls to hold through this dip then sell. Otherwise stop whining. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:09:10
Take some time and ask yourself why anything has value and you’ll see why bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:18:58
Yeah I know. I hate it when I don’t see ‘block found’ alert for that amount of time
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:27:36
Someone just needs to tell him that China banned it and he will endorse it
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:53:54
Hashrate for next difficulty adjustment is slightly negative. 2 days to go
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:14:49
I’m with you man. It’s sad how many downvotes you got. It’s like when managers told their employees they had to stop using their typewriters and move over to computers and everybody freaked out. The faster more efficient technology will always win. As usual the smart people will have to drag the rest crying and screaming into the future. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:25:37
And it’s gone...
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:28:59
I’m calling a bottom here. We are going up from here. Mark my post

The bubble will pop but I honestly don't think we are there yet. There aren't enough stupid people in it. Right now it's just the smartest that own and understand the tech behind Bitcoin. When you go to a bar and your average Joe is talking about Bitcoin then I'm going to get a little worried. The hardfork circle jerk in November is going to be interesting though.
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:28:47
The ETF won’t get approved. They will delay their decision and kick it further down the road 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:21:06
Let me think about that....NO!!!

Bcash is like a guy with a hamburger stand outside of McDonald’s yelling to everyone that his burgers are better. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:17:41
My prediction is that it will either go up or it will go down
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:51:24
Yeah because this post is completely logical and is forwarding the movement of crypto into mainstream.... really dude????
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:16:49
Jesus.... really???
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:33:17
I love it when people say bitcoin is backed by nothing. I reply “the US dollar is backed by nothing but 21 trillion dollars of debt and the faith that somehow they will pay it back” LOL
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:06:57
Yawn.... been in Crypto for 2 years now. Wake me up at $10k
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:25:32
See we can use bitcoin to buy coffee bcash people!!
@_date: 2018-07-25 04:04:19
Just by asking that question you have no clue how competitive and risky this business is. Start with a mining profitability calculator that you can google and it start from there
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:50:15
At some point the interest will become unsustainable. Simple mathematics and don’t fool yourself that we will reduce the deficit.
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:01:06
Yep, not yet. No widespread panic yet
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:27:35
If we knew the answer to that we would all be living on mega yachts
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:22:40
Or maybe an alien species will arrive and use their superior hashrate to steal all of earths bitcoin cos they be HODLing for hundreds of years before us
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:34:41
Lol. Everyone is told in 3 days you have to take all your coins off the exchange and they are all freaking out because it takes so long. You're in the Wild West of cryptocurrency days now. I can't count how many posts here have said DONT KEEP YOUR COINS ON EXCHANGES!!!! 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:37:28
Well this dude just got added to the bitcoin hall of fame

There were a lot more memes
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:57:47
My strategy. I have a price target. I don’t do anything until the price hits that magic number. Simple
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:30:39
I believe in the technology therefore I grab my shield and spear and march off to HODL and win or die with the rest of the spartan HODLers
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:32:29
We are officially in the despair phase. We are going to take one more leg down to around $2500/$3000 level and then the recovery will start. Only the strong hands will survive this

So Jesus was using the fundamentals of blockchain back then?
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:29:44
Ya I’ll agree with you. Usually the documentary keywords are bubble, drugs and money laundering. This was a fair look at bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:34:59
You need to go outside and take a walk. Looking at computer screens all day is not good for you
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:28:01
Well the dumb ones that buy now and don’t sell if it dips more then can technically be upgraded to smart people in theory..... right?
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:54:55
I won't bat an eyelash till it hits $1500 HODL!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:12:29
It might go up or it might go down but I’m guessing in the long term it will def go up so I HODL
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:04:43
Been a really long time since he’s gone up
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:00:57
Good for you. A true hodler
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:25:09
The smart people right now are buying and the dumb scared ones are selling. This is why 90% of people fail at making money in volatile assets
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:59:36
So Lucifer was planning a 51% attack all this time.... sneaky bastard
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:27:56
DAMNNNN!!!! That’s a whale
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:55:04
So you’re saying that it might go up or it might go down.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:33:36
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:00:46
Too many geniuses and or idiots involved in bitcoin that will be buying all the way down. It’s such a revolutionary, beautiful, technological principal of consensus that I find it hard to see how it could go that low. Unfortunately your average homo sapien fails to grasp the core concepts of bitcoin. If we could find a way to make everybody suddenly above average intelligence and understand blockchain then bitcoin would truly revolutionize this world
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:07:00
Ok I really enjoyed that. I’m heading back to the hodler trenches for however long it takes. Morale restored
@_date: 2019-05-03 03:13:18
Set yourself a price target and forget it till it hits that number. Simple
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:13:50
Oh geez. So tired of doing this.... Bitcoin will go up again. Fundamentally nothing has changed with bitcoin , in fact it’s stronger with the progress of the lightning network. There is a lot of FUD and panic selling going on. If you’re here just to make money for lambos then sell and fuck off!! If you understand what bitcoin is and believe in how revolutionary it is then stake your money and HODL
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:47:53
So dumb.. no one knows how low or high and when it’s gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-26 03:26:06

@_date: 2018-12-03 14:27:21
So tired of these dumb articles

I’m with you man!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:37:45
Join r/wallstreetbets you’ll fit in perfectly there. People here are a little more serious about the tech and in this for the long term
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:11:14
Relax. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. It’ll evolve into being the equivalent of digital gold while other more promising coins that have overcome bitcoins failures will be used for high volume transactions. Currently bitcoin is equivalent to 0.2% of the total $ of gold held in reserve. Just give it time

That’s cos they never had the internet and FOMO
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:55:07
HODL strong. Fundamentally nothing has changed with bitcoin just a lot of panic selling going on
@_date: 2019-05-13 04:56:04
You have an extremely small chance of your lottery numbers wining where as bitcoin is a 50/50 shot of either going way up or way down. Please don’t compare the two, it’s absurd

I’m with you

Gold... something you spend a lot of money on digging it up out of the ground and then you spend a lot of money guarding it. It’s difficult to transport and move over borders. Bitcoin beats it in every aspect. I wonder which one will increase in value faster?
Oh and we know there will only be 21 million bitcoin while we have no idea how much gold is in the ground.
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:20:40
Your average joe has heard of bitcoin but doesn’t understand it. That’s the big problem. Only smart people understand and use it which is the barrier to mass adoption. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:06:16

Put your electronics in a faraday cage and you’re fine. If you want a ghetto solution then place all important electrical devices in a metal trash can wrapped in plastic and it has the same shielding effect. If there is enough warning and the grid is shutdown before the flare hits the damage can be greatly reduced and bitcoin will be fine
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:04:03
