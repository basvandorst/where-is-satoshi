It is a distributed ledger and a medium of exchange. It doesn't matter if you give someone a cow for some bitcoins, or USD for some bitcoins.
Are cows currency?
Regardless of whether or not bitcoin's price is $0.1 or $1,000,000, what matters is the value of the thing(s) bitcoin is transformed into on each side of a transaction.
It is a protocol. Just like email. Would you call email a currency?

Buy now, but *take your time*. Buy in at the dips.

This is the problem. Bitcoin is being treated as a full on marketable currency and everyone thinks it is no different than money.
In reality it's not a currency. [It's a protocol.](
It can't die. But the sharks *can* make people regret their emotional impulse buys, like you're saying.

Take your time. Put in 50 here, 100 there. Go in on the dips.

Okay, true. But, there's no *reason* to use a cryptocurrency created by any institution. Why would anyone use a centralized version of an inherently decentralized technology?

Another legitimate use case is that it enables direct (uncorruptable) democracy, instead of representative (corruptable) democracy. These protocols do nothing more than provide uncorruptable, undeniable, objectively mathematical proof of a transaction, whether that be money or a vote or... kitties. Currently we rely on "trusted" 3rd parties for these things.

Because it's not a currency!!! Holy shit people, educate yourselves!
[It's a fucking protocol.](
It's functioning exactly the way it should be right now.

Blockchain is a separate technology, but it works in-tandem with Bitcoin. It is a **protocol** *for* the blockchain. Please read more than just the abstract of the paper.
Currency is just a really great ***example*** for **one particular use case** of these technologies.

It is a digital asset that *can function as currency if we want it to*. But it has many, many more applications that go well beyond the scope of money.
It can turn our representative democracy into a direct (uncorruptable) democracy if the people wish it so.
It cuts the middle-man out of nearly every scenario involving signatures and verification processes.
It puts trust and control back into the hands of everybody, collectively, instead of in the hands of wealthy individuals.

If it's centralized and controlled by an authority, then it's not a cryptocurrency, right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:14:37
Please continue to be uneducated by only reading the abstracts.

The blockchain technology and bitcoin were both created in direct juxtaposition to the worldwide banking system. I don't think it can have its own crypto solution.

The [white paper]( on bitcoin is a great resource to start with. Please don't take the abstract at face value and make assumptions that it is a currency like everyone else has been doing. Bitcoin is a *protocol* which is laid on top of the blockchain, just like email was laid on top of the internet. Currency is just a really great example for *one particular use case* of this evolving technology set.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:12
It can *function as a currency*, but it *is not a currency*. It has greater utility than a currency.
You could transform USD into bitcoins, or even another intangible thing like a vote could be transformed into bitcoins.
Right now, it is still money to the vast majority. In the not-so-distant-future it might represent something entirely different to the holders of bitcoin.
Think of bitcoin as less of a "thing" and more of a "function"

Haha, it's simpler than how it's done now!!
