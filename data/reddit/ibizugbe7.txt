Bitmain is deadly company
They partnered with Coinex to create CET, and they later Pump the coin, by having a false trade volume.
When investors finally put in much cash into CET, which they promised a continuous price growth, they would later dump their shitty CET and send investors to the grave site. They use same fund to sponsor the harsh war, as glad they loss. It's a victory for us all.
