Passphrase does not replace a hardware-generated 24-word seed. It's added after 24 words when generating binary master seed. You actually increase entropy by adding a passphrase.

The OP is 100% correct. Just read this:

This is total BS. Non-US futures exchanges like Bitmex and Okex existed for a long time. CME was and still is a very minor player. As far as I remember, open interest on Bitmex alone was around 1 billion USD during the bubble, compared to less than 100k on CME in 2017.
We had plenty of other places to short like Bitfinex and Kraken. Even Coinbase/GDAX had margin trading and shorting back then. Plus you could borrow bitcoin from companies like Genesis Trading and sell on any exchange, effectively shorting the market.

Yes, I understand that. My point is that "institutional money" didn't open big short positions on CME in 2017 and didn't pop the bubble.

CME futures have linear structure unlike inverse futures on OKEX or Bitmex. Shorting doesn't make any sense. You have limited max profit and unlimited max loss. Margin requirements for short positions will be insane. It's much easier to pump bitcoin price for larger gains. Market makers will have short position on futures fully hedged on spot markets, all other institutional investors will long futures to get exposure to bitcoin they can't get otherwise.

You are right, the top was $2800. The article says on May 24th, maybe it was written before the top on May 25th.
