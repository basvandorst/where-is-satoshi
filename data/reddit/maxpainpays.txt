You guys should be a pioneer in getting lightning setup.  You would probably get customers based on only supporting progressing the tech and getting word out on lightning

You know what sucks.. During the bear market this forum was all about excitement over technology.  Im pretty sure threads about trading would just be shunned and downvoted.
The tech was being really worked on hard and discussed.  Now this forum is all these get rich quick assholes.   I thnk its a bad sign the focus on bitcoin is mostly price now.  
There is a sub called bitcoinmarkets if you want to talk about price and trading.  It would be nice if this sub wasnt so tainted and diluted with greed.

What are you implying?? Its a futures exchange for trading bitcoin for more bitcoin.  Are you trying to say they dont know that bitnes doesnt take cash or that that somehow makes them inferior to other trading platforms?

There has not been a single case where tether was not redeemable for dollars other then the 30 million dollar hack that happened.  In which case that clause in the ToS made it easy to lock those tether down at their will.  That clause protects against bad actors.. It doesnt stop people who kyc from redeeming.

We need a bear market.  Its obvious.  Let it happen.. This sub will slowly become tech focused over price focused.  The tech will be implemented and evolve and then the price can rise again.  Mark my words.. Price will consolidate around 6k and stabalize a while.  Then lightning rootstock implementations will be more widespread.  Maybe an etf will come and the cycle will start over.
Until then dont get your hopes up

This is the dumbest theory.. Bitcoin and crypto had a parabolic growth in metrics other then price this year.  CNBC became a crypto network.. Google searches.. reddit subs.. 
If this rise was artificial your mom dog and dead uncle would not have bought bitcoin in the last few months.
Saying tether propped up bitcoin price is like saying the teaspoon of sugar you put in yoru coffee over filled the cup.
Tether is a tool used by the whole marketplace and if that tool goes away its bad for the crypto ecosystem and causes a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt.  Thats whats happening now.

This company that just stepped down from the audit did say they saw a full reserve in their bank accounts.  But the auditing process was too difficult.  Its probably not easy when its money coming from banks all over the world and anonymous crypto accounts all over the internet.
Every time someone on polo bittrex finex kraken binance and okcoin decide to sell some bitcoin for cash they are essentially creating a tether and putting the dollar value into the tether reserve.  Half of these places are anonyous crypto exchanges doing transactions on blockchains.. many of which are also anonymous.. like xmr.  
To expect an accounting firm to back track all of those transactions is absurd. XMR is literally unauditable.  How could it ever be expected the XMR to tether transactions be audited???.  The best they could expect was what they did.  Look at the account and say.. well its all technically here.  But we have no idea where it came from.
Just to reiterate. The vast majority of tether is created because John sees btc selling for 12000 on bittrex and 11800 on finex.  So he sells hit btc on bittrex to tether.  Which effectively creates tether for him.  That tether is moved to finex and buys the cheaper btc leaving a left over value of tether for him to use however he wants.
It is not randomly created, and has never been proven that if a verified customer tries to withdraw tether from the tether company they are not paid out in real dollars.  The only time that fails is if the person does not complete kyc.
IMO this is way overblown by a singular fudster on twitter named bitfinexed.
Tether conspiracy people will have you believe that this price rise over the last few years is not becuase all these new people are entering the market.. not because cnbc is now the crypto network.. not because of an obvious organic growth that we all probably have felt in the form of text messages from long lost friends.  No its becuase 1/100th of the marketcap in crypto is tether and that alone was used by a single entity to manipulate price up.  Not the thousands of people using tether as a tool in the market.
Frankly im pretty disappointed in the stupidity around this tether fud.

dude this place needs to get real.  The reason we are pulling back is a peak of mania in the public.  People were literally taking loans out on their houses to buy 20k bitcoin.  EVERYONE and their mother was getting on board.  That kind of buying pressure is not sustainable.  Coupled with the fact that bitcoin is up 20x from the start of the year means a HEAVY correction is in store.  
I hate to break it to you.. And I told you guys a couple weeks ago after the first dip to sell on the bounce to 16k.  But you lost your chance.  We are going into another consolidation/bear market similar to the first time bitcoin hit 1k.  
Now we will see how many people are here for the price and how many are here for the tech.  Because 8k is the next stop.. Then if your lucky you get a bounce back above 10k to get out on.  Otherwise after that you should be ready for the slope down to 5k.  Maybe even as low as 3k on some dips.  Then a year or so of consolidation to let hands change.  THEN world events and technology providing bitcoin will begin to slope back up.  Probably by the next halvening it will be seeing all time highs again.
Most people here now will be gone by then and all new people will be along for that ride.  
This is how markets work.  Even Andreas Antonopolous has said many times this will be a series of bubbles.  Its not just going straight up forever.
When the public goes manic for something.  That is the top.  Everyone that was smart and got in these last few years is selling into the public mania.  DO NOT tell anyone to invest with money they cant afford to lose.  This is going down and consolidating.
Crypto needs a cleansing.  Way too many scams.  Way too much mania.  This a natural cycle.  It is healthy.  This forum will slowly become about technology and not price.  That is good.  If youre in profit you should be thinking about taking some.  If you took a loan out you are in a lot of trouble if you hang on to this.  Just trying to help, I think a lot of people are going to have gotten themselves in so much trouble crypto will look bad for a while.

11.  the /bitcoin reddit is not meant to be about trading and its kind of perverted for oldtimers to see it entirely about trading nowadays.  it makes me look like an asshole to people in the space a long time
Take this shit to bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:49:18
take this shit to the bitcoin markets sub..
i cannot believe people are talking about a fucking sell wall in here now.  this place is going to shit.

Just to put a different perspective on this for people.  The whole year there has been a slow burning mania that slowly build.  We are not at the phase where people are literally taking out loans against their housed to buy bitcoin.  We are at a peak level of buying pressure.
This was teh top for a long time.  Yes we will probably bounce from here to 16-18k and make peope hopeful again.  And that will be your chance to get out before a bear market that turns into consolidation between 5 and 10k.  
The technology has been outpaced by the mania and things will need to even out.  Im sure in a year or 2 we will be back above 20k.  But if your one of those peope that took out loans or used money you cant lose you will have one last chance to get out before a long term downtrend followed by consolidation.
Even andreas antonopolous explains how this will be a series of bubbles.  If you cant afford it you dont want to be buying at the top and waiting for the next one.

except here are big advantages to being the longest chain.  it makes it the most secure.  on top of that it has the most computer scientists putting the most man hours into it than any other crypto by far.
There is nothing another crypto is doing that really smart people are working on adding on to bitcoin.
Again the main point of this is secure store of value.  The longest blockchain goes a long way into making that happen.   So it would have to be a significant breakthrough for another chain to take over.  Maybe when quantum computing happens.
For now your logic just doesnt include the part about being the oldest also makes it the most secure and for a currency security is paramount.

A lot of bitcoins big holders are not keen on doxxing thier trade accounts.  This will definilty lead to some people cashing out of the experiment.  Which would likely cause a waterfall on price for a while until people got used to the idea of bitcoin no longer being anonymous money sovereign money you only needed to report when you cashed out.

This is on bitmex so these are highly leveraged shorts.  Most are probably 50 - 100 x margin so even though they say 100000 it was probably only .01 bitcoin as collateral.
they also arent bailing they are being liquidated forcefully ;)
although im sure no one is complaining the way they do when the market makes a big move and liquidates people on finex.

why are you sending 50$ in bitcoin around right now?? is it an emergency... why not wait until the mem pool isnt full for such a small amount

or.. every alt coin is pumping so bcash has a little pump too.  i hate bcash as much as the next guy but its not some conspiracy every time it goes up in price.  a lot of people buy into the idea that vhs is the one true king and should never be changed. thats life. people are dumb and easily manipulated.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:14:42
I see that too.  I also see 3k-5k for a while first.  Markets move in cycles and all this straight up no pullback moon bullshit is going to hurt a lot of people.
We had a hype cycle and went up 20x.
Now price needs to settle and consolidate while all the cool things segwit allows actually become implemented and useful.  Until then fomoing in on every bounce is the same thing as selling every dip in the bull market.  If you cant tell the market has had a change youre blind
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:00:24
Yea this is the thing that bothered me a lot about that whole narrative.
Bitmex futures has always dwarfed the cme futures vastly.  I coudnt understand why people thought there was some conspiracy based around such a tiny amount of volume.  Price went exponentially up and then it corrected.  It had nothing to do with some wall street conspiracy.  If there was any conspiracy it was done through bitmex futures by the whales we already had.  They still do waaaaaaaay more volume than what wallstreet has done on the new futures.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:22:46
ughhh there is no conspiracy narrative. price went up 20x in a year and needed a correction.  That is normal market action.  There doesnt need to be some boogey main trying to steal your cookies

It used to be really really amazing. Bitcoin devs.. charlie lee.. fluffy poney a lot of amazing insightful people would stop by and chat regularly.  Now its almost entirely annoying new people.  Most of the long term traders there are also looking for 4k so your not going to like it too much most likely
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:45:58
Yea thats what im thinking too.. Maybe it disrupts debit cards.  But credit cards provide way more than just instant transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:47:18
After price goes to 3-5k and consolidates for a year or 2 im sure we will.  People are geting too excited over a bounce in a bear market right now
