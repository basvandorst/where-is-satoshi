We should just have automod say this on every question about what bitcoin will do

When I was a kid I owed some kid 50 cents and paid it back to him in 50 pennies that I cut in half. I spent like a week sitting in my room bending them in half with pliers, but it was totally worth it to watch him adamantly count out each one in class while the teacher yelled at us.

No, it was at least like... 5 minutes

Also it totally makes sense anyway. Huge price movement = more people online = more stress on the site

Someone bet $2.3 million that bitcoin would go down. It went up

I had bitcoin back in like 2013. Don't remember the exact amount but probably around 0.1-0.2? Not a huge amount but I make like 16k a year so it would really help with bills/rent. Then my dumb ass didn't bother using a hardware wallet or keeping track of the private key/password, so I've got like $2000 just sitting out there somewhere and no way to access it.

If you got it through you can still withdraw it [here]( even though the tipping service itself has been disabled. Got my $30 out of it last week.

That's what I thought, sites that have a reputation of being trustworthy and giving you what you pay for would be fine using bitcoin. Scams are already a huge problem on ebay and using bitcoin would make it pretty much impossible to do refunds.

Truth. Making $10/hr, I'm sitting here happy with my .008 BTC
