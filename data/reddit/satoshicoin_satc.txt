Well actually fiat does not have a supply limit, its monetary policy is adjusted by private non transparent bank called the federal reserve and its monetary base is backed by debt. It does not have a blockchain in which rewards are deflationary over time. A blockchain shows the movement of money and its supply. And of course much more favorable than fiat especially when a community starts transacting with it, gives its value.

I somewhat agree. Masternodes basically are governed by a smaller group of whales that are securing the network by holding large quantities and staking over a virtual private server. So therefore its a matter of if the general community of stakers trust the network and if our group Masternoders HODL. Our team is great and im very content with them. We the whales are actually transparent with our holdings. You can check it out. We however constantly trying to maintain coin holder value because many general community members keep selling their staking earnings. However as time persists and the project continues to grow, trading vulume will pickup.

My other answer is that, although not completely decentralized. The network is 51% attack resistant. Also, the whales have more control of coin price. And the general direction of project.

Just keep doing your due diligence and ask different people questions. Youll find some solid projects and youll probably find shit projects, you may even be scammed. At the end of the day its all on you. If you dont want to risk getting in and soul searching, then stay with fiat.
