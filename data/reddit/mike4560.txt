Bitcoins are perfect for these things except for the fact that you can't do delayed payments, will this have a return address if thing fails or make so you only promise that you are going to give bitcoins and then you get an email telling to send bitcoins when thing successes

Because the network would send you a email when you attempt to make a change involving an email this email will be sent through tor or i2p, the idea currently I have is that that one email is sent with multiple return emails (belonging to pairs) so then the person can reply to the email replying to all the addresses giving so it can be verified

Hm though of a good way todo it, k number of peers encrypt a random string maybe 4 chars long with the persons public key, then these encrypted strings are put together and sent to the email address (this im still not sure how todo, but may require one peer todo the sending) then the person receives the strings decrypts with his private key and the broadcasts theses unencrypted to the network where each peer confirms if they got there string back.
If a peer doesnt get a string back in 24hours the process times out and will not share this key in the hash table and will share that this key is phony. if the peer does get the string back it shares that email is valid.
new peers connecting to the network will download infomation from the system is there is a key that the peers disagree on it goes down to a sorta vote if it recieves from 4 different peers that the key is invalid and  from 2 peers that the key is valid then it will not receive that info, however if it recieves more then k amount of people claiming that they were part of the verification process and that the email is valid it will also decline it.

Main problem I have with this kinda advertism is that personally I would think it was a scam, or some silly game centrialised game currency, I'm not sure what the best way to fraise a flyer so that people don't just bin them, I'm sure a couple or more people will look up the WebPages and then share there new found knowledge to friends thou :D

Yeah I started by using blockchain.info still do but also have more bitcoins stored in the main client. I love blockchain.info because even iv there server gets hacked all there private keys are encrypted, even ifthe person who runs blockchain.info wanted to see your private key he couldn't and its very convenient it has an ios app and android, sadly not a wp8 one :( so can't use it on my new phone
