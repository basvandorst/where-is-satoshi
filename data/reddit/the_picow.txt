Best way is to sign up and get verified on an exchange. I live in norway aswell, personally i like kraken for lowest fees and fairest price compared to current market price

When you transfer money to them you just convert the krones to usd or eur, I prefer usd :)

Sorry for the late reply, phone stopped working. I'm expecting 4000-4200 atleast before it starts climbing again
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:22:30

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:37:31
Transfer them to an exchange and sell :)

Guessing it's more of a psycological barrier for people to buy at 6xxx rather than 5xxx, but yeah a small selloff is to be expected. New ath and 6000 broken for the first time

is crashing*
more like correcting after a 1000$ surge

Mempool will get filled, transactions will go through as blocks get mined no problems
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:27:24
Don't know, but remember reading you can presell on bitfinex.

EU here, I just stayed awake through the night
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:53:23
Noone knows, but I'm guessing no. Atleast not as big of a dip, best time to buy would be now
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:48:27
Little rise before another fall imo. but noone knows
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:30:05
When you sell at an exchange you don't go through the blockchain. The exchange already is in possesion of your btc, so yeah you get price A

I use plus500 for margin trading bitcoin, prices based on kraken. Sometimes switches to gdax if kraken crashes. I'm based in eu though but it's a general cfd platform so guessing it's availible in the us.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:10:52
5500 to 5600 in like 15 minutes on bitfinex lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:17:08
EU  :) people waking up and cashing up
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:31:17
ahah yeah, bitfinex had a 1200 wall that got eaten pretty fast
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:22:22
Don't worry the train just stopped for refuel, we going further
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:44:16
but hey, what do I know. And it's going to recover anyways so doesen't really matter as long as you don't panic sell
