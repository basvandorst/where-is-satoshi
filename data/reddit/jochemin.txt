Depends on the wallet or client the operator. I've opened a issue in samourai wallet to tag RBF incoming transactions as replaceable.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:52:40
Yes, my idea was definitely RBF-FSS. And I was convinced. ���� Thank you for your explanation.

The entire sub? I don't think so. But it's true I have been wrong for quite time. Your conclusion "renders payments on Bitcoin useless" is yours, I'm not agree. The replaceable tag is in the transaction, so they can be detected.

Ok, i was in doubt if your post was sarcastic or not... ����
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:00:58
Samourai Wallet, without doubt.

I'm doing my own research about Bitcoin nodes number. And I have detected 117000 nodes, sure there are some false positives (why?) in the addr message, but I would like to know the difference with Luke data.

Thank you for your review.
In LND 0.4 release notes says bitcoind backend is supported. 
I'll work to improve this script as much as possible.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:38:17
Hi, the script installs and configures a Bitcoin full node using Bitcoin Core 0.16 and a Lightning Node using LND 0.4.

I would suggest to move that copy to another HD, let the script do all the steps. Stop bitcoind and copy your blockchain again to the disk.

Please retweet --&gt;

I check for external hard drive bigger than 200GB if exists I query the HD id and ask you for format, the script adds it to fstab.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:41:31
You can review the code before using it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:24:57
1. No, Bitcoin blockchain today is nearly 200GB
2. Knowledge.
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:39:59
If you have the blockchain in another computer you can copy it to the HD. Let the script do all the job, stop bitcoind, copy the blockchain to the Raspberry USB HD and start bitcoind and LND.
I installed my raspberry yesterday and now is in block 334408

My bitcoin core version is 0.16RC1, I'm returning to 0.15.1. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:46:33
For now, you need the full blockchain. That's why you need an external drive.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:36:11
Just plug an external hard drive, launch the script, enter some data and wait.

Bitstorage a Bitcoin second Layer which provides decentralized storage. You can link a hash in Bitcoin blockchain with a document, vídeo, or other digital content in Bitstorage to proof ownership. You can pay storage in Bitstorage with Lightning.

I've done 3. First was to buy 2 stickers from blockstream, direct channel, the second to buy another sticker but routing the payment, the third to buy a t-shirt routing the payment again with more hops. Everything went smooth.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:14:25
Same with Bitcoin core 0.15.1 and 0.16Rc1
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:05:24
One of the Bitcoin clients. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:38:33
You can review the code or use some parts.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:15:14
I have done it several times, stop lightning with lightning-cli stop and Bitcoin with bitcoin-cli stop. After start Bitcoin with bitcoind, It remains synced, but lightning starts again from block 370...

Like the page says, the BTC are in scrow, once the seller gets the money, he clicks on a button that says "release bitcoin" and they go to your account in localbitcoins. Easy.
