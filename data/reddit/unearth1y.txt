If they could, they would I'm sure. Just as they squash everything else that threatens their ability to keep everyone enslaved through tax extraction and other unfounded means of taking what we earn.

Its a scam that is why.. the whole government is a scam. People say that slavery is dead but by god it sure the hell is not. Look at what we do with our lives, we slave away all day every day and they take almost HALF of what we make ... SLAVERY!!!! Once we do something that is going to cut into their profits they are going to take action in squashing it... SLAVERY ! Land of the free ...

There are worse / better versions of slavery. But still all slavery.

Lol, so if many of the "first world residents with a job, rights, and choices" - even those with decent savings wanted to stop working tomorrow, could they? No, because the way the system is designed ensures they cannot.

I mean something tells me they would just charge you the equivalent $4 charge worth of bitcoin... it doesn't cost them $4 to swipe your card, they are just inflating the price. If they simply forwarded the cost it wouldn't have been anywhere near $4 im sure
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:56:24
Yeah looks that way with the skyrocketing price... o wait... 
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:39:53
I agree man, I think the future is looking really bleak. This is the reason I simply refuse to have kids because I don't see things getting any better, only worse.

Agreed , I think it was moreso that I had just lost $8k from buying at ath that made me scared to get more
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:12:56
Yeaa , hindsight is 20/20 ain't it?
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:48:44
LMAO, awesome

Yeah thats why he stuffwd his pockets with his xvg , verge currency, scam last year.

So it would definitely probably make sense for me to sell... the most you can write off is $3,000 I think, which converted to taxes I think is like $700-800 dollars or so. I guess the only time it wouldnt make sense to harvest the loss is if you thought BTC is going to spike in the next 30 days
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:34:13
I looked it up and it said the most you can write off for crypto is $3,000
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:42:39
Gotcha i thought u meant straight up btc
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:21:02
I have regret... lost $8k on this in the past year.

I think eventually the world has to move to this sort of technology for currency. However, I do think a lot of people that were new in the space and got burnt in 2017/2018 will not move to the space willingly - it will have to be eventual IF and only IF more world currencies start to fail.

@_date: 2018-02-01 19:53:57
