Does the software exist for large corporations to take BTC directly? What if a payment takes days or weeks to clear?

“Adoption will lift the price further”
Compared to what? USD? Gold? Housing?
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:22:37
You could argue dollars are not “confiscatable” since you could hide them offshore. The problem is, if the government wants that money they will threaten you with jail unless you give it up. Until bitcoin is anonymous I would argue it’s not entirely safe from the government.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. The government can easily find and confiscate your money.

How did they do it with gold then? Fractional reserve. You can have notes backed 10% by bitcoin.
