Once the $ is in. It's mostly staying in. Next step is step up its use as an actual currency. That is where the staying power is.  When you get paid in half crypto then we win.

It's not the O/S - It's the Michael Tellinger group in South Africa.  Maybe will repost with that info...

It's not the O/S.
It's the Ubuntu Party - an organization.

Mine most of it, then give everyone on the planet their share.  What a shit show that would be.

I just got a take down notice for four ads' I ad listed as accepting bitcoin / litecoin or paypal... or escrow for that matter.
Ebay feels threatened that they might lose out on their paypal cut. Time for a new bitcoin auction site methinks.  This type of behavior is typical of behemoth corporations that can't change with the times.
Kind of similar to Napster / music industry or torrents / movie industry. We need a bitflix.

Has anyone approached Forrex?
