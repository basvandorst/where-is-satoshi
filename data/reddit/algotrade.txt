It’s disingenuous to compare the volumes in currency pairs without comparing the relative values between the two. You are looking at a pair, you must look at the volume of both pairs.

You got it.
Although, you CAN look at just one sided volume, if you also factor in price change (because they are exactly inverse and therefore calculable).  Which was OPs point from the beginning

What IV-Crush is saying (and he is correct I might add), is that, when volume is held constant, and price changes, there is an exactly inverse function on Volume vs USD.  
This is important to understand in currency trading.  
You must account for change in value to look at relative volume across time. 
Imagine this made up hyperbole to help get your mind around it:
BTC = $10,000,000 USD
Vol = 100 BTC
Vol = $1,000,000,000 USD
Now compare that to:
BTC = $0.01 USD
Vol = 1,000 BTC
Vol = $10.00
Which one has more "volume"??.  Well, yes more BTC traded when it was $0.01, but far less USD traded.  Which one is more important???  Well it depends what you look at.

You can’t assert anything meaningful from measuring volume of a currency pair only looking at raw volume of just one side of the pair. 
Unless this is just bitcoin transactions (BTC vs BTC) without the extra currency pair, then it would have some sort of value
But I’m almost positive this volume chart is comparing a pair transaction, you must look at volume of both sides, or one side and price change to have this be useful data in any sense at all.
