God, the shilling here is worse than today...and that is epic.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:03:06
God you're bizarre.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:52:40
That is what I was getting at.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:44:13
Are you kidding, it was all over them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:30:52
You are seriously fucking retarded dude. Seek help.
People like you are the reason everyone thinks we are fucking nuts.

Ok, I'm saying Fine, Unique, and Delicious next time they say the sky is falling.

Ahh, yeah I was getting no messages either. But the verification amounts were not showing up. I think my credit union was just ignoring the request or something. Anyhow, hope you get it worked out.

Why are you stalking conspiracy users all over reddit?

I set up wallets for all the kids in my family as stocking stuffers, and put some btc in there to start em off. Hopefully it gets them interested if there is a little skin in it.

Excellent point.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:20:07
I just wish they would let me buy LTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:24:04
Oh, for sure. But which ones is the current mystery. I hope she was buying acid.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:29
This is exactly what I am doing. Has actually made me much better at savings in general.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:52:21
Well...she ain't exactly wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:54:59
I can buy BTC on the main site, but I cannot buy LTC.
edit: LTC working now
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:24:12
Wasn't aware of this, and was honestly kinda doubtful, but sho nuff:

Hilarious use of goodwill. Not criticizing your post, it is just funny what happens in translation sometimes.

My kid sister was a little more adventurous. Awhile back when it was at like 6k I was talking about bitcoin, she said "oh I have one of those!". And sure enough, she whips out a paper atm slip. She said she spent a little on something, but most of it was there. She was very happy to hear her $200 "investment" was doing so well.
It was a couple weeks later that I started wondering wtf a 16yr old girl was secretly buying btc for. Much less spending it. My kid sis is full of surprises.

I do SQA and my coworker and I exchange projects periodically because you start developing blind spots. The push to deliver can also make you start tip toeing around where you can sense thar be dragons.
Having code that millions of people and god knows how much money relying on built by one dude, and not even reviewed? Crazy town.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:49:52
I'm also trying to work out the best way to move from a paper wallet to something like Mycelium. How do you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:40:53
I wish Mitch Hedberg was around right now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:35:59
Well, I'm buying like crazy, and probably not alone. What some see as a catastrophe others see as an opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:51:10
What if they were sold for $100 each?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:50:13

Might have a credit union they won't do business with. I had that problem. Hooked my Chase acct in and was able to buy and sell on that acct in like 5min from a dead stop.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:05:20
I have a mycelium wallet too that I kinda like. Do you have a recommendation?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:20:19
Why not coinbase? I have some over there.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:59:16
That's a damn good question. I think if there were no competing currencies the answer is yes. But since there are, a true anon currency would be quickly adopted for black markets, and probably become difficult to exchange because of that.

Thanks I'll check it out.
