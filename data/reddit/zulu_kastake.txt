I'm verified on Coinmama, and this was not suppose to be an issue. I could see a change in transaction time as it started getting longer for btc to arrive to your wallet. Issue here is that I wanted to invest some more money without changing my current portfolio. Imao, btc should not be touched as it goes up again and I'm happy how my other alts are performing. 
There should be a push from community on all crypto vendors to work in line with fair practice. Arogant attitude or lack of support should be punished by lack of business. They earn a lot on hefty charges. 
Another problem is that we don't know who sits behind  a lot of this companies. 
That's why I wrote this. People should be cautious.

No issues with congestion or increased demand. I get that.  However, they should say so or block transactions before they capture our money. I could've take my business elsewhere and buy btc. 
My money is sitting dead. And even if I get my btc after a week, which is a long time in crypto world, will they compensate your lost interest. I dont think so. 
In this particular case, I wanted to exchange BTC to GVT, which grew from 23$ 36h ago to 45$ right now. Almost double. 
It is a new market and fairly new industry but financial rules that industry is built on is centuries old. 
They should honor what we paid for. Otherwise, patience can be transferred into monetary value. Here more then anywhere else.

Kind of. I'm in it for 3months but I already had 5 transactions with Coinmama and all went well until last night. By went well I mean, all processed in one hour.
