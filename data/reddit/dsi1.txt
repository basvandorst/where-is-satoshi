Wow, they used to have color.

FYI: You can only handle 50 subs on your front page before reddit starts cycling them (unless you have gold)
More subs = less content in front of people, there is no need for pointless diversification.

RES' dark mode got me to use Stylish to turn Google Reader, Github, and Youtube dark.

that feel when you found out about bitcoin way back but CBA to mine it all night long
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:26:51


Hahah oh man, that's great. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:51:42
Probably gonna get downvoted due to being a gawker website.
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:43:41
"Why do you care?" is the exact same BS excuse given for surveillance and other privacy infringing issues.
@_date: 2013-01-23 04:14:46
lol gawker

Maybe a semester of college, hopefully.

You might as well use something rememberable if it's for a brain wallet.
 might be good, but that's only four words.

I don't think it has aired yet, either that or they changed the article's title to its next airtime (Saturday 3pm ET)

You do have to disable the subreddit style in some subreddits.
You could try messaging the mods and informing them that the style doesn't play well with RES' dark mode.

There might be a few large ASIC farm powers (likely governments), but they should be balanced out by the rest of the population P2P chaining in their spare time.

Chargebacks work but are non-optimal. 3rd party escrow pls
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:59:08
Low effort posts only get bad when the discussion also becomes low effort, so far this isn't happening.
@_date: 2013-05-30 05:36:16
Doesn't it use an actual service to hold the coins?
Can you even have a service on top of a service?
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:43:37
You said there are no reasons, I gave one. You think businesses don't want to maximize profits?
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:16:06
No chargebacks seems like a good one. (Customers can't waltz in and cost *you* money, they can only get what they were going to spend back through escrow)
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:43:03
Well, maybe people would learn to do some research before buying then.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:03:06
Terminology successfully coined.
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:39:29


Why do you care? Can I go ahead and look at all your PC's files then? That's the same shitty logic.

I really want to like flux but I can't handle the screen color change.
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:37:27


That is such a bullshit line, that's like MS making DirectX 2D only and then saying "It's still up to the devs" to use OpenGL or DirectX.

The format changes are due to people using items on the post, Reddit's April Fool's day is awesome and I hope it doesn't leave entirely :(

I'm guessing Eve Online :p

You're vastly underestimating the size of botnets.
Though a CPU only mining botnet is *really* silly.

No no no, fluffycore.

Chargebacks don't matter when you have access to [third party escrow]( (Basically, you have time to check if your product is good or not before the company you're buying from ever receives money, but you can't take the product and run because a third party is holding the money, and that third party cannot do anything with the money except send it back or use it to complete the contract (this last bit is all but impossible w/o a cryptocurrency))
