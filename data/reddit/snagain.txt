Todays news:
Now say that SWIFT as a tool does not affect anyone except Iran
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:59:48
We are all the Bitcoin dev team .... open source and a protocol ... impossible to strong arm everyone.

It is one of the tools that allows the US to pressure every country - and the US does exactly that.  The threat of Iran style exclusion from SWIFT is a very potent threat, and Iran was probably done just to prove the point.
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:58:46
I do not blame SWIFT - but they caved in to the USA and excluded Iran, proving that a centrally managed system can always be pressured.
Bitcoin is neutral because it is decentralized.
Tweaking the price to levels that **could** settle world trade, would degrade the threat that a compromised SWIFT system holds for everyone except the USA.  It would also re-invigorate SWIFT because there would no longer be any major value in pressuring the SWIFT organization if they no longer have an effective monopoly on trade settlements. 
All the bi-lateral non USD treaties that China is establishing have the same intended goal - but are much slower to take effect,

Ok - but I use the BRICS acronym to identify the major economies which individually (or acting in concert), could counteract the USA influence over SWIFT by using this tactic.

Hard assets = real things like: mines, factories, roads, ships, trains, oil wells, gas fields, agricultural land, well educated population... and so on. (inc Gold, Silver, etc)
The USA also has hard assets - with the proviso that:
- a fair bit of it (roads, bridges, electricity grid, water and sewage systems) is in need of seriously overdue maintenance
- much of the manufacturing infrastructure has been dismantled..
- the US education system (most of it) deliberately brainwashes and dumbs down people to promote fervent nationalism. Ivy league is the exception and basically reserved for the elite.

You are drilling down to a specific industry ... fair enough ... but what I am looking at is the macro level.  Global national level trade of the hundreds of industry segments.
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:59:01
See my later response.... but in addition, I am only referencing Bitcoin pricing as a way to break the SWIFT monopoly on international settlements.
International banking and trade financing, development funds etc is a whole different ball game and as you say, the BRICS are already working on those issues. I do not see them as intersecting heavily with Bitcoin as a payments system.

Not just Zerohedge .... Bloomberg as the original source. Since confirmed by other outlets.
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:12:05
If you were trying to degrade an American threat via control over SWIFT, you would not be worried about an eventual collapse of Bitcoin.  'keeling over' as you put it.
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:43:38
The BRICS do not need control over Bitcoin. They have control over their own real economies... Their problem is that SWIFT is effectively a monopoly for international payments, and the USA can leverage that monopoly to apply sanctions.
Take my last comment about China. China could peg CNH to a Satoshi - that would intrinsically make the Bitcoin network usable at a scale to match SWIFT. That would break the monopoly situation - even if very little trade was 'trusted' to settle via Bitcoin... and China would gain a powerful influence over Bitcoin - because it controls the pricing peg.
China would not need to 'trust' Bitcoin - just use it's **potential** as a settlements system to break the SWIFT monopoly.
Which system gets used (SWIFT or Bitcoin) for each trade settlement is then a commercial decision on a trade by trade basis, and as the incumbent, SWIFT would still get used extensively - but it's monopoly would be eliminated. That is a tactic of value in the ongoing currency war.
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:14:06
Agreed ... but that does not remove the tactical value (short term advantage) of attacking the SWIFT monopoly by re-pricing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-26 06:24:37
The suggestion is not about the dollar cost of SWIFT transactions. You seem to have missed the point about the USA abusing leverage through SWIFT as a financial war tool. Degrading that capacity is what this is about.
You are right to say they could clone SWIFT - but then they would have a problem getting others to use the clone.
Other countries have no more reason to trust a BRICS settlement system than to trust SWIFT (to be neutral).
Only an observably neutral system like Bitcoin is a credible alternate.
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:05:12
Of course they are skeptical.  But they are also engaged in a mufti-faceted currency war.
Used as a tactical approach, re-pricing Bitcoin would reduce a threat that the USA wields.  What happens long term after that I have no idea,  War always leads to unpredictable outcomes.
One thing however remains certain. Money (as a system) is only ever a symbolic representation of hard assets. And the BRICS retain those hard assets regardless of which payment systems are in use.
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:12:23
Accumulating off market is a well known and ancient tactic... but 'buy the market' is also an old approach. One that works if you are sure that you are a bigger whale than the others playing. There no bigger whales than the sovereigns.
I am highlighting the possible use of this tactic for an entity that is not terribly concerned with trading profits, but is very concerned about geopolitical leverage.
Bloomberg just ran an article about David Cameron that adds Russia to the list of countries with a very definite interest in side stepping the SWIFT system.

Why not - I am just pointing out that a BRICS nation could force the re-pricing to land a major blow in the currency war that is under way.
I agree that the re-pricing is likely anyway over the long term, but there is a real war under way, and I just see it as unusual that one of the players has not taken the opportunity to degrade one of their opponents weapons. IE - SWIFT.
@_date: 2014-08-28 12:57:29
This is exactly my point - re-price Bitcoin to a level where it **could** backstop world trade, and the manipulation of SWIFT by the USA becomes no longer effective.
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:44:25
I did not say 'peg' Bitcoin - please re-read. I said 'peg' CNH .... which China already does to another currency (USD) which they do not control. A currency which is absolutely corrupt on the money supply front when compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-26 06:29:59
This may be happening ... a shift to RMB... but that is a slow process, which will continue anyway.
In the meantime, the USA uses SWIFT (and other institutions) to attack other countries via sanctions, and more frequently, implicit threat of sanctions.
Enabling a credible alternative to SWIFT (via re-pricing Bitcoin) would degrade that ability to threaten sanction.  I think Iran would like this..
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:42:16
TL;DR summary: Trade/currency wars? Why have the main players not used something that can counter a big weapon of their opponent(s)
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:53:54
Once again ... $500 per BTC is peanuts to a sovereign... and BTC has a massive mining infrastructure that is not easily replicated. If it was done by a sovereign, the sovereign would have &gt;51% ... and it would no longer have the systemic trust that Bitcoin has.
Missing that trust of impartiality is the problem people have with SWIFT now that the USA forced SWIFT to exclude Iran.
