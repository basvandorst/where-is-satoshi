Good job with your Eth introduction, and the way you handled the security aspect of it. After the comments you made about how "hardforks are just fiiiine" this comes off pretty hilarious. 
Everyone - including you - would be better off if you just stuck with your job and tried to run your company properly instead of making a fool of yourself  by commenting on BTC's "politics" and technicalities. 
Hopefully, lesson learned. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 00:19:27
that's so cool, thxs man... enjoy the mbits =)
@_date: 2016-08-01 11:31:10
Of course it's ok for anyone to voice their opinions. But his opinions (notably on hard forks) have now been proven to be particularly wrong. It's both embarassing and damaging to the ecosystem to have the CEO of one of the most proeminent companies in the space to routinely display such a lack of understanding of the technology. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 15:08:29
I guess the real why is why not having a backup :) 
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:23:15
(as of now it's unconfirmed for 3 hours)
@_date: 2016-04-29 11:26:43
Well I've never used their services - and never will, but their whole perspective on what BTC is/should be is giving me troubles. How 'bout that ?
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:33:19
That's really cool . I just opened a new thread wondering just that about an unconfirmed transaction.... 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:56:56
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:49:24
it's now confirmed =)

You sir deserve the greatest respect. Yay!

The pickle I just bought is also better than coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:12:13
That's because you need to compare those 3b to the amount of btc traded for price discovery, which is of course a tiny portion of the total mcap
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:20:58
And why should they ? Last time I checked bitcoin was a GLOBAL thing, so I don't see why US regulators should have a say

So you would  willingly open the network to a plausible attack just because "why would people attack ?" You're a special kind of naive.

Use it with electrum, Trezor Web interface sucks, last time I checked they didn't even have dynamic fees. ...
@_date: 2016-03-11 12:54:25
Oh shit ! How are they going to buy their coffee now ????
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:13:23
So true... Using electrum's dynamic fees, I never had a problem and my transactions always get in the next block, even these days
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:05:22
No. I think - as pretty much anyone who understand the technical aspect of the problem - that btc problems  (namely scalability and fungibilty ) will be solved by other layers. Hence the need for Segwit 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:06:42
You might want to check the Total Transaction Fees in USD graph on blockchain.info.... 
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:21:17
Well, no. Miners income is not block rewards + fees ; You have to substract costs, and given the zero-sum/highly competitive nature of mining, it's not inconceivable at all that at this point already fees are a substantial part of their income.

The one with Szabo was awesome imo 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:03:52
Agreed, but it looks like despite Bitcoin dominance being now at an ATL (73%) there's enough "fresh" money to buy the dips in the price. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:43:54
What about greed ? Blocks being full means juicier fees ;  today a miner's best way to prolong that situation is to vote for BU and oppose segwit.

@_date: 2019-03-20 11:42:31
This. I love btc and all, but I always found those books for kids about Bitcoin extremely creepy. A book about what money is in general would be much better, and will likely have the desired effect anyway....
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:45:58
As for the title, I think "one fool and his pool" would sound better
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:16:10
send $1!
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:17:13
hahaha =) nice one sir !
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:05:13
YES! !!
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:09:26
Omg.... Ok, so I'll explain : The primary reason you can't transfer 50$ Billion is that you don't have 50$ Billion. Same for the unbanked. As such, they certainly can send any amount they want ; So do I and so do you. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:34:13
Nailed It! 
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:55:23
Coinbase being short on BTC would be consistent with BA's loud and repeated opinions on BTC I'd say.
On a side note, BA's spamming this thread about his vault is just sickening. Ignoring embarassing questions - to say the least - and trying his best to fool newbyes into believing they need his company to hold some coins...
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:09:42
I got what you meant regarding market and already commented on that part. 
As for north pole : Print a QR code with a new btc private key, go to the north, leave it there, come back, send BTC to corresponding address, and, boom, done ! 
@_date: 2016-06-01 22:49:51
I like it... I'd like to have seen a bitcoin logo in the end though, but the message is great.
@_date: 2016-06-01 22:53:13
if you think the main reason you're unable to send $50 billion is bitcoin limitation.... think again. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:10:00
That info is worth (a lot of) money in the btc jungle market. ... don't expect it being published just for the sake of being nice ....
@_date: 2016-11-13 08:25:15
To put it shortly : Plain stupidity
@_date: 2016-11-13 20:47:28
oh boy.... 
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:25:06
I aswell as all people I know who hold btc  support  segwit!

Should be a picture of Roger Ver 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:30:48
Roger's points/arguments are known by all - he has like 3  and just repeat them ad nauseam.
Yet it's not that often that I see those are being contested efficiently, probably because most competent/knowledgeable actors wouldn't spend time arguing with a scam artist.
Yet noobs come to get Bitcoin to Bitcoin.com and get instead an altcoin with same name and address format. 
We need more of these challenging interviews.

Their hability to make false logic statements is indeed impressive
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:04:17
Well that's the problem with paperwallets : way too much ways users can and will compromise their security. The main being that to spend them, they import the private keys on an online device/service wich totally defeits the whole purpose.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:01:19
come on, don't be too harsh... There's still a really good chance he's just as dumb as he sounds
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:02:35
Don't worry, it all clears up when you sort by mcap instead of name... 
@_date: 2016-10-28 09:38:19
Thanks so much for working like you do, and, most of all, thinking like you do! ! ! 
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:17:59
Thanks a lot for clarifying ! it all makes a lot of sense now, hopefully sender will understand aswell.... 
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:36:25
hopefully they'll never come to realize that by attacking the network they're just making it stronger....  
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:53:04
I hope I'll get sender to resend indeed, but so far they (it's a company) said they've send it already.... So now I'm left wondering at wich point will those coins be returned to their wallet ? Or maybe have that Tx be rebroadcasted would do the job ?  
@_date: 2016-05-10 23:17:20
No one needs paypal 2.0, cause there's already a paypal. You won't get richer in that process, Roger, cause what's making your many coins valuable is censorship resistance, wich crucially needs decentralisation. 
You didn't get rich by being smart, but, hell, try to give it a shot ffs

BTC is about freedom and censorship resistance. It's the monetary equivalent of freedom of speech. 
Only thing to ask you here that comes to mind would probably be censured....

Hey thanks, looks like the solution ; I'm not the sender but I contacted him quoting your post, so hopefully he'll be able to create that new tx... 
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:06:50
Well I was able to explain things to the sending company and they sent another transaction that went through ; props to them for a very efficient support !
@_date: 2016-05-01 13:03:20
Logic fail. If btc traders are as dumb as you describe, then the coming halving can't already be priced in correctly. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:27:16
send $6!
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:00:15
So this basically means they spent some of those coins already...so the coins they sent me went back to their wallet right ?
