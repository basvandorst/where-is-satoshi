You can get the historical GHS/BTC graph at   Use the drop downs.
On cex.io you will probably lose more from GHS falling in price, than you'll make from mining with those GHS in the same period.   Your gains or losses will be much more based on what the price of GHS does than on how much they mine for you.   I'm currently in a bad position there.

The android wallet app locking you out while the site is down is not cool.  I just can't spend my money while blockchain.info is offline?  That's really bad. It seems like the android app shouldn't rely on a centralized auth server.  It should be able to broadcast to the blockchain directly if it needs to.
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:43:51
What he is talking about really happened.  This is a decent attempt at explaining why.
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:00:42
First of all, you're right.  
You've recognized that the bitcoin software is both open source, and a distributed peer to peer network of nodes.  Each node is running a copy of the reference implementation, authored by the core developers.  Unless they're not, because they don't have to.  They can download the source code, change whatever they want, run their altered software and talk to the network.  So when you realize this, you gotta shift your thinking.  Bitcoin isn't a specific piece of software, it's a protocol.  It's really the rules of how the nodes talk to each other.  However, another shift in thinking needs to happen after that.  Bitcoin isn't just software, and it isn't just a protocol, it's a system of incentives.  
Here's a recent example:  Miners discovered that they have an incentive to not include all the transactions in the mempool, because smaller blocks get propagated faster, and so if two blocks get found at the same moment, the larger one, the one with more transactions in it will likely be the orphaned one, because the smaller one will beat it to the majority of nodes.  So the transactions per second that the network was doing was low, because so many miners were choosing to not follow the reference implementation and changed how they were building blocks before they transmitted them.  Gavin was able to find a way to make it so that no matter how many transactions are in a block, the block is the same size.  This removes the incentive for the miners to be shitty about which transactions they include.  Gavin wasn't just changing the software, he was providing a change to the system of incentives.
So now that he has a solution for a problem in the incentive structure of the network, he needs that change to get adopted by all the nodes, and the only way that is going to happen, is that it is in the best interest of all the nodes to adopt the change, because it makes bitcoin better, and if bitcoin is better, it's worth more, and the miners profit, because their bitcoin holdings are worth more.  Even the lead developer of Bitcoin can't change it across the board without the consent of the miners to run the change.
You can also see the system of incentives at play in the GHASH.io 51% drama.  It's in a small miners interest to join the largest pool so that they get the smoothest payout schedule.  But when too many miners do that it threatens the whole system, so then they back off and mine at another pool because it's not in their interest for bitcoin to crash and burn.
Bitcoin isn't software, and it isn't a protocol, it's system of incentives.  If anything is in the majority of miners' interests, it will likely be adopted, with or without the blessings of the core developers.  It's not in the majority of miners interests to operate as you describe.  That's why it wont happen, and that's why you're wrong.  The class of bugs I'm worried about in bitcoin, are bugs in the system of incentives, not bugs in the reference implementation software or protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:16:13
Bitcoin is a protocol.  You can interact with the network using custom software you wrote yourself as long as you know how to speak the language.  So things like transaction malleability, and selfish mining are in a class of attacks that anyone can do, as long as they don't use the official bitcoin software, and write their own instead.  Now from the network's perspective, you have to account for anybody being able to broadcast any weird transaction they want and make sure there is no way to alter the ledger maliciously.  There isn't, so far.

The companies immediately sell the bitcoins via bitpay.  They are accepting, but not holding, they convert it to dollars immediately.  This means that any purchase from these companies is actually direct selling pressure on the price.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:19:41
You could make a number of paper wallets in advance and then pay with those.  Most paper wallets are made to be the same size as dollar bills. if you put some bitcoin on each one they are pretty much paper bitcoin cash.  Obviously the person you give them too will want to sweep the balances and then transfer the btc to a new address right away.  you could even have an extra one for them to send the "change" back to.

Because it distrubutes both the profit and the risk.  if you make a single personal loan and dont get paid back you're just screwed, but if you contribute to a pool where something like 17 out of 20 loans are repaid you'll still make money, or at least not lose as much.

@_date: 2014-02-27 20:46:06
This could never happen.  It is cryptographically impossible.  Each block in the blockchain is an "ingredient" in the next block.  This is why more confirmations make transactions more permanent and secure.  If you wanted to change a block, you have to re-solve every block afterwards again.  There is no such thing as "changing the blockchain" in mtgox's or anyone else's favor.  One of the big reasons the system requires zero trust, is because nobody can do exactly what you're talking about, even the people "in charge."

The actual reason why is because there is a reviewable evidence trail.

Well, the main thing is not confirm any transactions while he has the role due to being MIA or even maliciously.  Most blocks are solved by pools.  That gives the ability to shut down the transaction network to a handful of people.

@_date: 2015-11-10 08:06:54
I don't like that solving a key block makes the miner responsible for signing transactions for the next 10 minutes.  Creating a persistant state for a special miner that lasts for ten minutes relies on the assumption that this person will continue to behave according to that role for that time instead of going rogue or missing.  Currently miners are stateless.  They broadcast their block solution and then we don't care if we ever hear from them again.  There are unforseen weaknesses here.

You should just mod your board so that profiles can contain bitcoin addresses that the user's can update like any other field.  Then put some buttons on each post that pop up the QR code for that user's address.  You could have some buttons code into the QR a preset amount of btc, like $1 or 25 cents to send to that address.  
You don't gotta build a big system to manage all your users' btc accounts, those exist already.  This scope is actually doable for the amount that you're advertising.

Hey man, I'm a client side app dev, and i was playing around with bitcore but I sort of got discouraged when I realized that to conduct a transaction, I would need a server side piece.   I sort of felt like making a bitcoin transaction should be possible from client side using a REST API or something.  Like I shouldn't need to manage a persistant connection to the p2p network in my own stack, but instead just fire off an httprequest with an included signed transaction and have my problems just go away.  What do you think about that?

The answer is that you can get usd into gox, but right now, you can't get it out.  When people want to pull their usd back out, they need to buy btc, send the btc to another exchange, and sell it there, and then pull out the usd at the 2nd exchange.  Everybody is buying at gox, everybody is selling at the other exchanges.  This is the reason for the spread.

If they don't accept BTC themselves, someone else is gonna eat their lunch.  On the other hand, if you try to make a btc amazon or ebay, you'll be put out of business when the big guys do finally come around.  It's interesting from both sides.

Arguably they do not "deal in or exchange funds" and they also do not "send funds based on customers instructions." All Mutum Sigillum LLC does is collect dwolla payments and transfer all it's money to K . K. Tibanne in Japan, which does the actual exchange work based on customer instruction.  A serious argument could be made that Mutum Sigillum doesnt do these two things.  K.K. Tibane does.  That company however, is in Japan.  Even though it is the same people, these are different corporate entities. IANAL.

Bank gets deposit of 10 from A.
Bank makes loan of 9 to B, B promises to pay back 10.
B puts his 9 into Bank.
Bank makes loan of 8 to C, C promises to pay back 9.
C puts his 8 into Bank.
Bank makes loan of 7 to D, D promises to pay back 8.
D puts his 7 into **his business.**
You could have gone on and on...
But, at this point Bank has 10+9+8 = 27 worth of accounts.
Bank actually has 3 on hand.
Everybody pays back loans.
Bank gets 7+1 back from D, but only owes 7 back to C.
Bank gets 8+1 back from C, but only owes 8 back to B.
Bank gets 9+1 back from B, but only owes 9 back to A.
Bank made 3, but in the meantime was at risk if everyone wanted all the money in their accounts, like in It's a Wonderful Life.  Also at the peak of it, bank had 27 balance on accounts, and 7 outstanding in loan to D.  Somehow there was 34 in play, off a 10 deposit.  Not exactly thin air, but pretty close to it.  One unit of money can be way bigger than one unit of money.
The catch is that all the numbers were in Bitcoin.
