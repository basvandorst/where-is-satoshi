I’d rather poison myself than eat my own dick, just for the record.

Funny, i first started by working on a ruby cli to monitor tickets &amp; trades but finally decided it would be more convenient to abstract all the exchanges plumbing behind a nodejs gateway. This way it’s easier to consume data from the various exchanges

Most exchanges provide REST API. You need to refer to each exchange documentation to know the endpoints and parameters. If you're interested in checking prices on Binance, Bittrex, Kucoin, OKEx or Poloniex, you can install [ which is a self\-hosted service which gives you a unified API to those 5 exchanges.
A demo of the service is available at [ For example :
* get *USDT\-BTC* price on *Binance* [
* get *USDT\-ETH* price on *OKEx* [
* ...
Hope it will help you to start

Yep, annoying. Last year I started working on an alternate trading interface because of the login process &amp; poor mobile support from Bittrex \(although it got a little better with last update\). Even if I mostly use Binance now, I'm still going back to Bittrex from time to time. It's one click\-away using [ \(sorry for the self promotion\) ;\)

Having an immutable, secure ledger is worth the energy consumption imho. Also, the energy will not grow linearly with the adoption of bitcoin (the energy is required for POW and is not proportional to the number of people using bitcoin). We just need one single immutable and secure ledger (I’m not saying we need only one chain but only one chain acting as THE immutable/secure ledger). It might be bitcoin or another chain in the future (we’ll see) and even if it might seem that a lot of energy is wasted to some people, it gives benefits. That’s just my opinion ��

Ah crap, didn’t think about all this complicated stuff and numbers. I wish I met you before.

Why does it have to be exclusive ?

Then why don’t you do the same all over again and spend year 2020 travelling AND telling everybody why you should have hold a few years more ?

Doesn’t really matter. Stable BTC at 1000 would be fine with me
