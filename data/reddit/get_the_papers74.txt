I'm a non-dev, just happened across it on DevPost while trying to figure out all this blockchain stuff. Here's the link to the project:

I've walked around in a big circle today with all this. I'm just a noob so as soon as i read Mike's piece this morning, I started the process of moving bitcoins out of the vault so i could sell them but I have to wait two days which is good cause it let's me research some more. Glad I ran into this thread. How do I buy SETLcoins?

thanks for the link. i've traded volatility options and futures, i get that there is no true 'VIX' product because of the lack options (if someone knows about a bitcoin option market, please post). 
if prices are pretty steady/flattish and the market spikes, that is an increase in volatility to me and i want an indicator that represents that which this does. volatility products that use options do the opposite of that which i don't care for anymore. notice the price of BTC in the first 10 days or so in november, the price spiked and so did the vol index.

I've been involved in the B/D business twenty years and worked with/for clearing firms. It's amazing how stupid/lazy the employees of clearing organizations can be. It blows your mind. When I think of the possibility of the blockchain and smart contracts, it's in eliminating this 'fat' - a tremendous savings on the expense side. It just seems like once they figure out that they can replace all the stupid people at the clearing firms with the blockchain, they will do that for every industry and the unemployment rate would jump to 60% and that's hard to imagine happening.
