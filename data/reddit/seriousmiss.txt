I like your business a lot. How many people have you got working for you?

I think this woman gave way to much attention to this asshole sexist idiot. He is the blonde girl, she the nerd. They guy acts out so knowing at all, I would never engage in a conversation with a person that says for three times in a row - woman don't usually- . 
If she had more conversations with the others, she might has some fruitful conversations. I am a woman, new to bitcoin, purchased a half around Christmas and waiting for my funds to arrive at Kraken to buy another half. I don't know a single person in real life that is interested in bitcoin and have not met anyone that purchased some. Which to me is an indicator that I am still early and I will continue to buy more when my budget allows it every month for a long time.

Agree. This is what I have been doing- Mortgage is already paid more than half etc, and have saved a fair amount for me daughter who is not even 4. 
I will buy shares for that full amount as well- although that is easier as I will pick a set of shares for long term. I always figured save a lot and do this before her 5th birthday- as it would not be wise do so in 12 years from now. I feel I have to do something for her as well as current rent is less than 2%! Exciting it is as those shares that I would have bought if I had the money earlier- all went up by a few hundred% in only a years time. Find it much harder now that I will spend real bucks.

I still got so much to learn unbelievable. This us first time in my life that I have some small money to invest. Monthly left overs is what I put in bitcoin, and will probably do so for at least a few months. My savings account is being transferred to a trading account and I guess I will be buying Tesla and Suncity. Its all very exciting to me as when I did not have money I always knew how to stockpick and won twice small prices in stock competions. How different it all is when you are actually investing with real money.

If you ship to the Netherlands, I would love to buy a box. I like the products a lot. Or, I could send you a box with some Dutch artisan products, and depending how you like it you could send me a box in return!
