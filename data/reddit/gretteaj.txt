I tend to agree, lots of positive sentiment still. wouldn't be surprised at once last dump. But I think it might be in a while after it rises all the way back to 6k and then people will get out at that previous barrier. I think bitcoin is due for a solid bull market for a month or two even in this overall bear market. Monthly chart right now looks great. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 09:00:36
I dont think that it is. I believe the foreskin you are looking at makes it look like he has a mask.
@_date: 2019-11-21 23:40:55
Well...what's everyone think? Are we gonna drop below 7400 in the coming days and create a new 6 month low? Yes I know predictions are useless, still fun.
@_date: 2019-08-03 04:41:48
Very well said.
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:29:56
You couldn't have timed that better lol
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:51:44
Watching these last few whale dumps get eaten back up before you can blink is freaking awesome lol.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:20:04
Just hit a monthly high. Nice.
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:00:24
We shall see fellas. Honestly not a big deal to me regardless of how the rest of the year shapes out, I will continue to play the game. One thing I know for sure is that when a weekly or monthly sentiment breaks out on Reddit, the market tends to follow the opposite afterwards. In early December people were getting upvoted for saying 1k in 2 months. Now I am getting downvoted for being pro bitcoin but neutral instead of bullish. Not saying you guys necessarily fall into this category, but after a couple days like this, there are a lot of people who think they are badass hodlers and not in it to get rich and then when the market doesn't play out the way they think they reverse course. Myself and others all took that path. Bitcoin needs to be boring to spark the next decent run. People need to quit caring what's its doing or checking its prices, and stop making memes after a $200 increase. Cause the truth is that type of excitement leads to mini sell offs.  
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:52:06
Haha typically I would very much agree, this one I'm still unsure of. Could just keep going for a bit.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:28:49
Ha quite a bit of optimism, too much to be honest. And probably not for the right reasons..
It's gonna be really tough for a real bull market to emerge anytime in 2019, and would be unhealthy if it did. But yes, bitcoin not hitting a new low in 2 months is encouraging, as are things like transaction volume being at new highs. Those are the things I am excited for. Patience my friends, I'm hoping for us to sit around levels like this for a while as things cool down from a few crazy years. Accumulate and conquer!
@_date: 2019-02-06 01:07:10
Holy hell...over 2.1k comments on the daily discussion from exactly a year ago. That was the first big drop to 6k. Only 70 comments so far today lol. Encouraging signs of consolidation. Just need a few more months of nothingness.  Tip of the hat to all the hodlers, all the ballsy dip buyers, all the actual users, and bitcoin activists for sticking around through the wild years. You guys are my heroes. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:33:53
A consolidation period is necessary to attract the right type of investors, i.e. long term ones. 
A bull run right now would cause the same type of buying that occurs at the last half of every bull run, the FOMO, get rich quick mentality. Without the building blocks of savvy long term investors buying and hodling at the bottom, another bull run so close to the previous one (2017) would mean an even harsher and quicker fall to low levels, and nobody wants to see that.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:52:30
17 month high fellas.
@_date: 2019-12-22 19:35:17
Definitely not saying the bottom was in, but would be interesting if it comes to be that was the bottom a few days ago.
You would have a huge bull run (2016-2017) followed by an EXACT one year bear market, followed by almost an exact half year bull market, followed by almost an exact half year bear market. Crazy.
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:20:05
I have ad block. Yet somehow I have an ad for Wells Fargo on the Reddit daily discussion on the most bullish bitcoin day since 2017. Oh the irony....
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:08:55
Man this is crazy! Browsing through all the threads here...it's clear that a vast majority have lost hope. Peeps getting upwards of 20 upvotes for bashing lack of fundamentals, dissing retards for buying right now, and talk of btc going to zero. Finally, the capitulation is here!! Hold on my fellow bitcoin believers...the end is near. I think the pain will be over by the end of the year and then we will have a nice boring 2019 of consolidation. 
Just remember, every sell has a buyer, and the only ones with the balls to be buying right now are the ones that won't be selling anytime in the near future. These market cycles finally are starting to make sense to me.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:03:53
Times are tough, no doubt about it. But I'm genuinely not worried in the long run, which is why I am confused to see how the daily discussion is mostly anti-bitcoiners talking about their assurance of btc's death. Reminds me of late 2017, when anyone skeptical of the parabola was immediately hated, and that you were an idiot if you didn't think the coin was absolutely going to take over soon. Makes me wonder how many comments come from the same individuals. Ones that hate when it's in a bear market and praise in a bull. Essentially taking the emotional path of least resistance, which has really never gotten anyone anywhere in life. 
I love tracking bitcoin wallet creations. Keeps me confident in the future. Sure lots of these are duplicates, lots are people that will never buy any bitcoin or have any understanding of crypto...but some are new HODLERS, some are using their bitcoin, some hate current financial structure. It makes me giggle to hear people say bitcoin will reach 100 bucks or go to zero. Look at this chart from ANY time frame. And explain how that is remotely possible when new user rate is constantly increasing. 
50% percent more users than the ATH. All that indicates to me is the extreme overbought and oversold conditions of this market. Especially after the recovery from 3 separate "crashes" that were heavier than this current one. The prevailing sentiment from bearish people has been "Yes, but this time is different, lots of people lost money, and will never get reinvolved". This is both irrelevant and fictitious. Human history has shown people are addicted to greed, as one Redditor subtly mentioned with his casino example. The morons selling now will buy once it recovers and is approaching or exceeding ATHs. Additionally, people seem to forget how small crypto markets still are. 74 billion?? That's really nothing. 31 million users in a 7 billion person world? IMO, the hard times for crypto are over. The previous crashes were more dangerous due to the total lack of involvement and understanding. Just like how business bubbles that survive a few massive bubbles (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) make it stronger and less likely to ultimately fail in the long run.

Need some insight and help fellas. Gemini has been on my ass about my use of their exchange for funding gambling websites. Which is true. I was planning on using my binance account instead but they have a daily limit of only 2 btc and are going to start a kyc policy that I am sure will hurt my chances of getting away with massive deposits and withdrawals from sportsbook websites. My question is if a hardware wallet can solve this problem?? I am very ignorant on the subject. I only buy and trade bitcoin at extreme intervals (mostly a hodler) but I do trade a bit and would like an exchange open. (Gemini has threatened to shut me down if I continue my current rate of transactions without trades). With a hardware wallet can I make transactions online without the use of an exhange? That would sure solve my problems.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:25:09
Indeed. Forum sentiment seems to be a good indicator of the nearing of the end of a bull or bear run though. i.e. "We are going to 100k by new year, cant wait to buy more with my next paycheck" from last December, to "Get out now before  it hits $100 by spring" of right now. 
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:24:58
Well unfortunately I think lots of exchanges do, not just coinbase. Got shut down from Gemini for funding gambling websites.
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:23:33
Yeah I'm guessing I need to make the switch to a personal wallet if it would help since I have been making 5-10 btc transactions a week for over 2 years. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:21:01
I don't have any losses. Sold 75% of my stack between 10-14k. Will never sell the other 25% and will buy more when I feel better about the market. Probably February if all goes to plan.
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:57:12
Yeah no new money, thats why almost 40% of bitcoin wallets have been created post ATH. Wonder what they've been up to...
The profit taking may not be over, but it is probably close. If you bought high and sustained over a year of misery, then I doubt another drop will fluster you much. The few buying right now aren't looking to sell in a few months for a 15% profit, they are going long. Whats why the period after a bear market is so boring and stable, few are buying and few are selling
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:38:45
Obviously lots of people will not fall under these categories. But in a large scale this is very accurate. I am a firm believer in bitcoin but it will take time. The irony of successful cryptocurrency is the easy availability of profit taking. Which is why in my opinion the bull runs will be lower each time percentage wise while it is still is the future...100x times growth in 2013, compared to 20x growth in 2017. But the volatility will continue to actually decrease as a result and stabilize which will in turn create the new world's currency. But because it is valued in dollars, it will take a long time. 50-200 a years I predict before the 1 million "dollar" bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:12:53
Good example of FOMO right here everyone. People that think they are smart for not buying low and buying when its SUPPOSED to keep going up. These are your 95%ers
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:36:53
I don't trade much at all, just looking at a re entry point.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:39:56
 Wow. An entire month of being in a channel that only ranged $550. The volatility has been remarkably absent. Every day that goes by without a new low has me more confident the bear market could be over and we just have a nice boring consolidation year in 2019. I will be very excited if we don't see a new low for the next couple months. But even if we do fall I will be slowly accumulating. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:30:12
I agree. Bitcoin has become kinda like politics in that most people are so one sided, especially in bear and bull markets. The negativity nowadays is almost completely price driven, but the interesting thing is that development and news has been very positive overall in the last 6 months or so at least. 
Bitcoin's price has never gone in the direction that it should based on it's advancements. Looking back at the bull run in 2017, it's absurd to think how many issues there were and nobody cared...issues that are since being solved or at least look to be in the near future. A knock on volume? Fine with me. That's what signals the consolidation period in previous bitcoin cycles. 
The undeniable truth is that thousands of bitcoin wallets are created each day, and transactions are going up. Yet the current bears are like 2017 bulls, just seeing no possibility of a reversal. They truly believe that bitcoin will be under a $100 in 2 years. Which is really cute. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:44:25
typically 4-5k, 7-10 times a week.
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:05:48
I didn't say I have bitcoin. I said I use it. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:24:23
Gambling. Which is ironic with law changes that are essentially making it legal throughout the U.S.
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:10:55
Yep. I think I calculated last year that if btc marketcap was equal to gold it would be 250-400k a coin. Should be interesting to see what happens once old people start dying and inheritance money changes hands.
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:35:57
Yeah it is similar for sure, I'm just glad I didn't get back in then cause I was extremely close. But like I said, another couple months of this and I will believe it is over. Right now I would say 50/50.
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:44:02
Well my Gemini account has been closed and I am banned for actually using crypto instead of trading to make the exchange richer, so I'm backing to making my daily transactions with coinbase. Is it always this fucking slow? Over an hour with no confirmations. Also have a deposit coming in for over an hour with no confirmations. Lame.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:37:56
That's a cool website, and I will definitely look at it in the future. I appreciate the link cause it adds some needed insight. Overall I am surprised that the active address rate isn't even lower. Considering BTC is 80% down and the active user rate is only down 50%, I wouldn't consider this bad at all. Not necessarily encouraging for the near future, but far from discouraging. Also, the slow rise over the last 8 months is reminiscent of the 2014 recovery. (Yes I know past performance doesn't predict future performance...even if it is the best indicator for bitcoin). And like I said, even if those new wallets are 99% trash and worthless to bitcoins value and price, some are representative of new hodlers and adopters.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:51:18
Just remember, you could always be a bcasher and be down 27% over 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:04:07
Lmao at all the sad and disappointed people.
Newsflash to everyone expecting/wanting to get rich from btc. Although sometimes you get lucky and it does happen overnight, usually there will be some pain and suffering involved with hodling crypto. But the longterm chart doesnt lie. If you can force yourself to just buy and check the price every month or so eventually you will be greatly rewarded. 
You either belief or you don't. If you want a chance at a quick buck hit the casino.
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:12:29
Ha thought about editing but I kinda like the error.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:09:44
Is 15k where you bought? Just remember not everyone made or lost the same amount as you. Some did well and some did worse. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:03:03
I've been trying to learn more about national and global economics recently. Obviously many bitcoin enthusiasts believe in some type of impending financial crisis, which I do as well. I thought some of you might find this article interesting.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:08:04
Bought in 2016. Sold 2 bitcoins at 10k. Sold another at 14k. As for my final bitcoin. I have watched it lose 17k. Bought loads of litecoin for 28 bucks. Sold half at 356. Watched the others wither. I am not really rich in my mind. But I am pretty sure I have more money than you. Just try making small weekly buys this next year buddy and be patient. And most importantly sell when you hear about women wanting to invest. That's what I did and it worked out pretty good. Just got out a little too early. I panicked when Grandmas bought and now plan on being greedy in January when the last soft hands have given in.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:10:43
It's weird, I was banned from Gemini for excessive funding of gambling websites. I then switched back over to Coinbase whom I started with nearly 3 years ago. I have made probably near 100 transactions to various gambling websites, most of which were very large sums. In my 3 years I have not heard from them. Crazy.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:23:16
Definitely a decent point. But there was still a lot of weird optimism for most of the year. Newbs literally believed November and December was gonna see another huge bull run like the last 2 years, and finally starting panicking when they realized it wasn't gonna happen. Glad I refrained so many times from buying at all those 6k opportunities. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:41:11
I bought low and sold high so no I don't have much in common with them. They thought a 3, 6, and 9 months were as long as the bear market could go. And I think in a few years it will have recovered, how is that an unreasonable opinion?
How about a bet? I buy you one whole bitcoin that you have to hold for 4 years. If at any point it reaches an ATH, you must give it back. Otherwise you can keep it and finally sell. Which might only be $0.01 but there is absolutely no risk to you. Sound good?
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:54:35
Huh. Thought it might be kinda dead in here from minimal price movements the last 2 days. I was wrong. Still lots of bitcoin bashing. Love the sureness from people that this bear will just keep going. Looks to me like a majority of the panic selling is over. If you had the balls to hodl during this putrid year, I doubt you are going to wake up one morning and sell at a 15 month low. Prepping for a boring 2019, where all the lovers and haters find a new hobby. Should be a safe buying year. Good luck believers!
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:23:06
There isn't a good reason to make most purchases with bitcoin over your credit card. Right now. This is why a majority of bitcoin talk is still related to price instead of usability. It's obviously still a speculative investment. Oddly enough, I would like more purchasing options to be in bitcoin because most of my earnings come in fairly illegal ways through crypto. So it's actually more unsafe for me to cash through my exchange for purchases and have to possibly explain that to banks/governments. But I am aware I am a very small minority.
Right now nobody is buying bitcoin so they can buy a sandwich with it. They are buying it as a hedge against inflation in the coming decades, as a hedge against a possible future of corrupt and tyrannical government, and as a belief that this system will eventually develop into a more accepted and practical use of transferring wealth across the globe without an intermediary. It is up to you to decided if any of these other reasons are valid for you to buy right now. But yes, if you don't do anything shady or illegal, there is no reason for you to use it. That's why almost nobody does.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:38:05
They never cared for it and still don't. 98% of people do little research and just want to get rich. Which is why there are volatile swings. 
Bitcoin might take a long time to recover but it's wild to think it will never reach the same hype. The people that got rich and sold will be back to do it again. The people that got poor will come back to do it again cause they love misery and a majority of crypto investors are gambling addicts. Thank god for the hodlers and the ones that use bitcoin for transactions, and the ones that teach about the tech, and the team that improves the tech. Without them btc would have died a long time ago. But now it is too late. It will never be killed.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:32:52

@_date: 2018-12-07 02:32:02
Just like last December except opposite sentiment. "35k by end of year, 50k by end of January."
It's amazing how engrained people get in current trends. They truly believe bear and bull runs will continue forever even when they are in hyper modes like now where it's been brutal for 3 weeks.
