I’m 50/50 in bitcoin and Litecoin.
I’m curious on your thoughts on ethereum and it’s use case?
I’ve yet to see a viable use case for any ico...in fact, I’m fearful that it will lead us at some point into being a bubble that pops.
I get ethereum, smart contracts etc, but don’t understand the use case for the publicly traded token...outside of being purchased to release more icos and effectively raising the ether token price.
I get the value of the ethereum alliance and the private chain but am having trouble wrapping my head around ethereums token.
As for bitcoin. Yes, it is insanely slow and not good money. By default, I’ll argue it’s best use case is a store of value because it has the ability to transmit insanely huge sums of money.
Obviously, any blockchain could do this...and this is where bitcoins market penetration shines.
The scaling solutions will come and even if it were to happen today, it isn’t as if the world as the infrastructure and know how in taking advantage of it.

Money gets its value from the network effect.
The more participants you have who use it and believe in it, the more value it has.
I’m going to go off the deep end here but ever wonder why governments charge an income tax? 
It’s to force participation in the fiat economy. 
Strange isn’t it how the federal reserve, income tax and removal of gold standard happened around the same period.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:39:09
It sure adds a lot to the discussion, you just missed it
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:50:33
The only thing that gives money, or anything for that matter, value is network consensus  - ie: a group of participants who are in agreement that it indeed does have value.
You can apply this idea to fiat currency and to bitcoin. 
Obviously those buying in to bitcoin are people who tend to have, for the most part, lost faith in fiat...and of course you have people buying in for fiat gains and purely speculating.

Capitalism is a great system in the early game. However, the broken mechanic that it has...as Thomas pikety points out in his book...is the passing along of generational wealth and wealth consolidation. It is deeply flawed on so many different levels.
In my younger years, I used to be entirely opposed to capitalism but have grown to appreciate that it truly is a innovative distribution system because of the initial financial incentives.
But an heiress multibillionaire sitting on her great great great grand dads wealth, who buys real estate in major cities like its candy is more of a cancer to society than some poor schmuck on welfare living on government assistance.

Definitely hindsight and again, I’ve taken a lot of gambles in my life. Some good, some bad but I’ve learned from them all. I’ve made some tremendous gains and also taken some beatings...in the end it’s about finding your tolerance to risk and making an educated gamble.
Luck is part of it. After all, it is about putting your neck out there. This holds true with any endeavor. Nothing is ever a sure thing.

Coinbase is at fault, they have conflicting interests.
They have an agenda to push bcash and are the middle man in this complexly new system of finance. If coinbase was brought on to be advisory and custodian, then it’s their fault.

I’m going to reiterate what you wrote, as I understand it:
I download electrum or mycelium to my Android, sweep my public key from my paper wallet onto the app. 
Take my private key and put it on, say a trezor or offline computer...
A few questions so I could better understand the mechanics:
How would I sign my public key if my private key is offline?
Also, when I sign the transaction with my private key...will this generate another qr code and is this what I’m scanning to broadcast?
Say that there’s a virus or malware, would someone be able to intercept my broadcast? Or what is the most vulnerable area in this whole process?
Thanks again!

Yes, you’re 100% correct. Bitcoin is outdated and clunky and “garbage”.

It also has a huge development working behind the scenes to make sure this piece of shit chugs along. You have to understand, this is NOT an easy feat.

I’d have to disagree with you on the wealthy and spending.
I get the idea of value “trickling down” but it only trickles down so many levels.
Also, I read the article you linked and the author is assuming 3 million is “wealthy”, which is peanuts compared to the wealth I’m talking about.
Someone with 3 million, let alone 100 million (believe it or not) has very little financial impact in the larger scheme of things. There are much larger fish out there...much.
I see inherited wealth creating blood clots in our economy. I think there’s a huge dichotomy of the average persons perception of what true wealth is and if they understood, they would understand the root of our problems.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:53:19
I do see the point in the cost associated with generating one. If there was no cost, it would be too easy for anyone to enter in, which wouldn’t make sense because it’ll remove a lot of incentives.

@_date: 2018-01-05 15:51:12
I’ve heard mcafee argue this point of bitcoin having intrinsic value because of the financial costs involved in mining.
I’d have to disagree completely with that. 
Bitcoins main value is from market penetration (network effect). The more people who understand it and believe it as having value, the more value it will have.
I think people who say money should have intrinsic value have no idea what they’re talking about.

Golds “value” is from perception and not rarity.
The industrial revolution brought with it a higher frequency of commerce and gold was ousted by fiat. Fiat is much more mobile than gold. Gold prices were insanely cheap up until the last few decades, where it was arbitrarily decided to become a hedge to fiat. 
The technological revolution is now proving fiat to be inefficient and bitcoin will replace that.

One thing ive been stuck on is the group think of “hodl”, which i think is completely destructive as bitcoin cant have value unless its spent/accepted.
I get the idea and need of later two/three etc solutions but what I’m wondering is as we progress with halvings and fewer block rewards, there will need to be enough transactions to happen to be a proper incentive for miners to continue mining.
Have you given any thought to how these 2nd layer solutions will need to settle/close their bitcoin channels in order for mining to be sustainable?
Sorry if my question is all over the place but i hope it makes sense.

Larger point (and my criticism of OPs post) is that 99.7% of existing bitcoin laying dormant for a month (though im sure this number is not accurate), is not a good thing for bitcoin...at all.
His post is incredibly misinforming and blatantly stupid.
If we were to say 99.7% of facebook users did not log in for a month, facebook would be on the path to failure.
Same goes for bitcoin. 
Bitcoins only use case is to be an impenetrable ledger, these other things you’re envisioning are later 2 solutions that can run on top of bitcoin.

Youre missing my point, bitcoin isnt money if it isnt being used as money. How can it be an “option” or hedge against fiat if the larger group of us are mindlessly chanting “hodl”?
We need to use this shit as money. Im sure youre aware of transaction fees and mining block rewards.
How will miners get paid if there are no network transactions being made because retards are busy “hodling”.
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:50:57
Again, you’re applying too much financial mumbo jumbo into your rationale.

You dumb shit, do you understand that if 99.7% of the addresses were dormant, its effectively saying that people are sitting on this shit and not using it.
If bitcoin is going to be “money for the people”, it HAS to be used.
A 99.7% inactivity of total bitcoin for a month is basically saying that its a failed protocol.

@_date: 2019-10-17 21:34:18
I believe bitcoin is a great tool for value because its an impenetrable ledger but we arent quite there and it doesnt matter what you think about it not being money.
We need transactions to happen and for layer 2 solutions to not only scale bitcoin but also to settle so that miners can get paid.
If transactions dont happen/settle and miners dont get paid, then the incentive diminishes, and bitcoin dies.
Fortunately, satoshi is a genius and wrote the block reward to halve every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years).
We have a few more halvings to get our shit together but at some point when the block rewards start diminishing, we need to transition into giving mining fees and mining fees will be shit if every retard is still chanting “hodl”.
Hodling is a stupid and destructive practice for the bitcoin network

I’ve read up on this every single day since last year. I’m actually always looking for someone to prove me wrong on my understanding of where bitcoin is heading so I can cash out and forget this.
Short of being a programmer, I’d say I know a great deal about bitcoin. I attend meetups in San Francisco and have heard some interesting stories from some very early adopters.
You’re also wrong on your assumption on how I got in. I first came across bitcoin in 2013, I even tried mining it and i didn’t understand how it worked. I immediately thought it was a scam and forgot about it.
Fast forward to feb 2017, I read an article in the paper about how “criminals and terrorists” were using bitcoin to hide from law enforcement. This intrigued me because these are some of the most wanted people in the world, why would they use bitcoin? I did some research and finally wrapped my head around how it worked and I’ll never forget that moment.

Self made wealth isn’t as simple as what you see in the movies where it’s a story about some guy with a great idea, a few collages and boom, he’s successful. 
There are a lot of relationships, partnerships and investors that happen along the way.
Everyone starts off with great intentions and then somewhere down the line, after the success comes, it turns into maintaining that level of success...at all costs.

@_date: 2018-03-03 14:15:58
Point of me divulging any personal information was to give some perspective.
A lot of people are conditioned into believing that we live in a merit based system but I’ll have to argue differently.
The opportunities I’ve been afforded in life because of how I grew up, the social networks I’ve acquired, how I learned to present myself, socialize etc...these are all tools to communicate to like-minded folks and the chances of me becoming an utter failure were slim to none. 
Edit: yes, there are people who work hard and move up in life. These stories are few and far between. Also, everyone’s perspective of success varies. We all live with compartmentalized notions of success and this misconstrued thought collectively blinds us.
Warren Buffet touches on a point where he discusses why he’s not going to leave his kids any money. He says that it’s because they’ve had a head start in life and resources to be as successful as they possibly can. He’s absolutely right.
Whether or not he stays true to this, the ideal is very thought provoking and the average person doesn’t understand this because they don’t have the perspective to.

I agree loosely with your sentiment but disagree with middle / lower class saving less due to “inflationary incentives”
Without getting too deep into it, there’s a reason why the government gives billions in aid to farm and food producers. It’s to shield lower accessible items from high levels of inflation and price volatility.
This basically “pulls the wool over th eyes” of the general population.
Meanwhile, assets and goods that are open to true market competition ( real estate, equities etc) go “up” in price.
This ultimately has a devastating effect on us wage workers because it drastically cuts into our purchasing power (rents, property taxes etc).
Please understand that the middle class includes anyone who basically collects a paycheck. Yes, even if that paycheck is 1 million a year.

No income inequality in crypto to speak of, since we aren’t talking about wage distrution.

I placed my bet that the environment was different and it was.
Lightning was just released and there are some MAJOR players sitting on the sidelines right now. These fuckheads downvoting me are too dumb to understand the fomo we will hit when an etf is approved.

By definition, I’m a self made “millionaire”.
I inherited a few million as well. 
I grew up poor and lived in starrett city, nyc. A lot of people I grew around came from broken homes and single mother families. My dad was fortunate and flipped houses and eventually moved us to an affluent staunchly middle class neighborhood full of white collar types.
In college, I barely got by with a C average and had an accounting degree without trying. I landed work out of school and eventually worked my way up to a nice six figure job, without ever having tried.
Fast forward a few years and I am now a partner of a very successful design firm. 
Sure I worked hard to get to where I am and took some risks but the ground floor in my life was a lot higher than most.

@_date: 2018-02-27 03:21:01
You seem to be a bit confused.
When we see things priced out in dollars, it’s an expression of value.
When people make these claims of bitcoin reaching $1m + in value, they are accounting for bitcoin soaking up value.
I bought in at $850 after finally wrapping my head around how bitcoin worked. I took out a calculator and accounted for global value (including debt and derivatives, because these are assets that are accounted for on someone’s balance sheet.)
When you take into consideration all of this, you arrive at a minimum value of bitcoin in the millions.
Keep in mind this figure DOES NOT account for the network effect the billions of unbanked will add to bitcoin, if ever they were to become participants.
Bitcoin is the only asset ever, that increases in value with increased population (not due to inflationary metrics).
$100,000 in value is a joke, with all due respect.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:16:38

Also remember, when bitcoin was released....it was just a project with zero guarantees and not the hyped up “$1 million or I’ll eat my dick” media machine it’s become.
Edit: with that said, I’d find it equally plausible that Dorian satoshi Nakamoto is the real satoshi being that when bitcoin was released, no one knew how it would catch on and once it did, the creator would want to distance themselves.
