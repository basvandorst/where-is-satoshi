That’s very interesting, now if I wanted to circumvent Coinbase in general in terms of selling my coins (let’s say they’re blocking access again) what would you recommend I use? P2P btc sites are my first guess however I’d like to hear your thoughts

Firstly, thank you, I truly do appreciate your contribution to this conversation. Secondly I figured it was a lot more volatile than normal stocks and so far that has proven to be true xD, thirdly I figured a hardware wallet was the way to go however I’m just curious how that’s more safe than a centralized third party institution such as Coinbase

Isn’t binance banned in the US? Also I should have said I’m based in the US

No, although we may be in the middle of a boom I came to the realization that we probably are in the golden age of cryptos

Everyone has their own predictions, what makes your any different from the hundreds if not thousands out there? You aren’t a special snowflake. Not saying it’s not gonna go down, but who are you to say it will?
