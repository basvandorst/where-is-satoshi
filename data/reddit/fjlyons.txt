Ok, so go put some hard work in and be better than everyone. That's your mentality, but the fact is you'll never be able to do much more than you do now without serious changes in your life and attitude.

You're saying that as if following the same pattern means the same returns, in the same period. Bitcoin could easily follow the same bubble it did 2 years ago, but only reach 25k.

As you should be. Bitcoin is a volatile asset. It fluctuates massively with next to no reasoning and planning. You can project Bitcoin logically.
One day, it could be a unifying currency used the world over, with super fast transfer fees and next to no way of having it stolen. 
Right now, it is the wild west, and there is a gold Rush. People are looking at this fourth dimensional object trying to make sense of it, but whatever Bitcoin ends up as does not exist in our world yet, and it never has in history: fair, decentralized, valued currency. It'll destroy the very nature of exchange rates and transfer fees, it will make banks useless.
But only if it succeeds. If it doesn't, it is a stock like any other, experiencing a ridiculous bubble that will have to burst, and it could, and should. Why should a Bitcoin cost 10,000? Why not 1? Because at the end of the day, when all the bits are mined, and all the coins are owned and stored, it will have to expand.
Most of the world's money only exists in code, as credit owed. That concept will have to exist if capitalism is to continue, and if Bitcoin is finite, and runs dry, they'll just credit the shit out of it like they've done with every other currency the last 70 years.
So best case scenario, Bitcoin will have a few decades as a truly wonderful technology, that will eventually be ruined by human greed.
Make hay while the rain shines, because some day there absolutely will be a drought.

Bitcoin has often followed a trend of growth when other currencies were dropping, and with Brexit around the corner, the EU is going to be taking a big hit, the UK a massive one, and the Hong Kong situation might see a huge international call to action against china. The next 3 months could see a massive recession, which will see a rise in bitcoin

... this could just as easily happen to Bitcoin and other currencies

Ha awesome send me a link I want to see who I am

Are you forgetting that Bitcoin dropped from 18k to 2.5k in 6 weeks or are you just stupid?

All you've done for 2 hours is comment at me. Go away please.

There is going to be a perfect storm of brexit and the next US election that will likely cause massive economic turmoil

Looking at the trends of bit coin it will this is the first of 2 spikes before a bull run. We'll see an elastic drop to the news on 10k, in a months time it will have dropped probably to 8k and then up to 14k, before dropping again and getting a big rise for October.

So you're saying if another 40b is invested in Bitcoin it'll reach 100k?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:20:00
Because I invested at 5k and nearly tripled my profits? It's not luck, it was pretty easy to see that this spike is not natural and is going to drop even further very quickly
