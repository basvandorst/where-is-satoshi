You have to know that about 80% of bitcoins are "created" in china. They make dollars selling them they don't lose any of their dollars.

For your small amount, buying 1BTC is the best idea

Yes. This year will be massive for bitcoin. Just don't forget that the whole thing is a bubble and there is an end to it. Enjoy the hype and make the most out of it and walk out at the right time

Scaling the block size does not help bitcoin in any way. We must find a way around without manipulating the bitcoin software

You can keep them at coinbase until they get hacked. If you dont know well about bitcoin you can just leave it there and move your bitcoins from there.

Hardware wallets give you an end to end experience with saving bitcoins also. For paper wallets the specific instruction is to get a clean clean computer offline and download bitaddress.org website's offline zip file on the left bottom on the website. And run it on your clean computer offline, generate a wallet and use it. Never go online.

Sorry for not recognising the prophet. I knew this was going way too far but I just HODL because Im here for the long run. The dump was just to collect the greed from leverages.

I like this crash. It landed on the exact linear trajectory saying like : fuck leverages and go home thats a warning

@_date: 2017-01-05 11:36:33
Yes. This was caused by some manipulators to sweep out all the greed of the leverages people took to make quick bucks. Bitfinex reached a $908 for a second to liquidate all leverage positions. They intend to say : no levereges no greed that's a warning
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:35:10
Yes. The world will realize how cheap a bitcoin was
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:42:37
All software wallets are not fundamental and vulnarable to hack. If you plan to use them as a saving and hold for a while, making a paper wallet is the best Idea. Use bitaddress.org.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:11:16
Well that will be the climax of this years maddness I guess? My grandmother might ask me how to buy bitcoins by then. That'll be the perfect time to give me a break and gtfo

You have to know, they create the bitcoins. Selling bitcoins offshore is exporting goods and making dollars for the chinese people. It is not a kind of currency leak. Its like south africa selling diamonds.

@_date: 2017-01-02 17:26:52
Well, you have to know that the chinese mine all the bitcoins and sell them for dollars. That is a good way of making dollars for the chinese government. Also, china has control of a large portion of the bitcoins making a leading country in this industry. This is their only chance of beating tha dollar. Why kill it?
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:18:49
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:29:13
Not really. See my new post on this. Its because of the slow banking system. The chinese are a click away but the rest has a slow and old wire transfer system that take days for the funds to transfer.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:28:55
Number three is about to happen to many that think themselves as rational. The real rational is that you hold to see the maniac and let it go at a higher price

Probably this rally will end at some point. But bitcoin has never came back to where the hype started. Which for this one, is $1000-1100. Probably after the hype it will stay at $2000ish.
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:28:05
They aren't smart enough that bitcoin is meant to be a free asset. They are trying to make the coins circulate in their own boundaries.
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:42:11
Bitfinex was hacked. If you want to keep fiat, think of bitmex.com. They dont need any ID verification but just your email and they approve your deposit in 1 confirmation. The exchange only handles bitcoins so by shorting the same amount as your bitcoins for XBTH17(futures contract) will give you effect same as fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:07:13
Yes. If youre not sure just start with a portion. Buy 1BTC and you will be well seated for the future.

True. Noone knows what the chinese are up to. Just saying that bitcoin benefits china rather than harming them.

@_date: 2017-01-02 23:55:27
Btw if you are not intending to spend your BTCs in the near future, I recommend you to generate paper wallets and keep your funds in cold storage. Generating wallets is possible via bitaddress.org

@_date: 2017-01-05 01:47:43
Every block currently generates fresh new 12.5BTC to the miner. The tx fee is an incentive added to this 12.5BTC. Currently the transaction limit is 7 per second for the whole world. If transactions get saturated, miners fee will increase to make the people think twice before doing transactions.
The block size is just a linear solution and that wull not solve the issue. Increasing block size will just make the blockchain heavier making it more centralised. Therefore developers are working on a network called the LIGHTNING NETWORK that will make possible millions of transactions in milliseconds which will make bitcoin perfect for currency. At the moment its more like gold.

@_date: 2017-01-05 01:41:23
Personally I have never seen a proper exchange delay transactions for so long. It takes only a couple clicks to do a transaction if not automatic. Whats up with coinbase? Extensive censorship?
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:15:49

@_date: 2017-01-03 14:51:07
A think it changed a while ago. Not accurate though. If online purchase is not possible go to an merchnt that accepts bitcoin and ask to sell some. If not, localbitcoins are good too.

It becomes fiat when enough people use them. Selling/using them widely bu the bitcoin holders will help bitcoin sperad faster. At the moment the world is having a hard time to breach the exchanges despite the bitcoin itself is easy to use. The centralised exchanges will not free the unbanked people any further.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:44:12
That is fine to do. Arbitrage gives value to the community not mentioning that you earn money too.
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:15:30
Bitcoins are same as your dollars but it has two differences. First is that it is an e-cash that does not need anyone to allow transactions, and you fully own your money, and the second it that there is no FRB printing them out to pocket themselves. The code and laws of mathematics print the money therefore there is no risk of dirty people taking advantage of it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:36:16
This is mainly because of the banking system. The asian banks have smartphone apps that transfer in a touch while the western countries take hours if not days to wire transfer. You can see that the japanese and korean exchanges are extreamly higher too.

Depends but I think it may go to $5500 and drop to $2000ish. If the hype ends faster, it will result another hype going way higher. This is how bitcoin settles so just embrace it and enjoy the ride.

Buying it with cash is totally the best idea. Find a merchant that accepts bitcoins as they should have bitcoins too. Ask them to sell some for you.
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:37:02
Well, we are on the way of exchanging hands now. So if youre satisfied woth what you earned, thats totally fine.

Dont do anything strange, just buy 1 btc and forget it for 3 years then youre good for sure. The price will increase anyway

They collect taxes from the mining equipment, the mining business, and the exchanges. Thats how governments make money. Bitcoin does not reduce china's dollars
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:46:42
You need to include enough fees and make sure that the wallet isnt taking it away I see lots of dirty exchanges and wallets charge miners fees and pocket them resulting low quality transactions

Yes. I live in Korea and the price here is $1120. about 1,400,000 won. It was always like this before. Just a premium for the supply/demand I guess.

Good news for you. Keep up the savings and it'll be worth millions.
@_date: 2017-01-01 02:28:30
That is more fair since holding your bitcoins will be like getting pension or earning interest on your purchasing power. This is like rewarding saved money same as the banking system but just like the early ages without credit. But remind yourselves that there will be derivatives and credit expansion on bitcoin and bitcoin banks as well

It is beacuse of the slow banking system of the western countries. The asian countries use smartphone apps that take seconds to transfer. This is true because japan and korea also have extremly high prices too. It's just a matter of the speed of capital flow of the markets. It's gettin loaded.

Stick with well known exchanges although they may be frustrating setting up your first trade.
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:38:12
Unlike 2013 there are many leverage trading sites. Most of the exchanges give leverage options. That is getting sweeped every rise and profit taken. The manipulators sell at once creating panic then they buy all back in the bottom anyways making profit.

You buy bitcoins from someone that has it by giving them what they want. In general you use bitcoin exchanges for other currencies to exchange
As the supply of bitcoin is limited more demand will cause bitcoin to increase in price or scarity therefore having more buying power
There are several bitcoin online casinos as you google them and for a leveraged investment you can use bitmex
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:43:38
Yes. Thats evil of a exchange. They should've liquidated it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:42:17
In order to not fall into another mt gox, i think you should do localbitcoins and a p2p exchange via cash or whatever. Those coins get to you instantaneously at the place.

Most wont be wise enough to keep them.

bitcoin may not be printed more but the derivatives and all kinds of trust bonds, banks can be constructed as the same as this capitalism is built on top of gold.

That might include your comment too
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:30:42
Its the number of people that consider it desirable to own that makes the value. Remember that the mayans had no idea that the yellow stone had houses of values in the west

@_date: 2016-12-29 04:01:06
That is true. We need debit cards and swifts directly from our wallets but at the moment that is impossible. So put the right amount of money you wish to use on coinbase and put the rest at your independent wallet

 Bitcoin will have the same for real money. All we need is time for development and that is why we get profit for

@_date: 2016-12-28 23:20:54

Lightning network or something like that should do the work
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:05:26
Tes the fees are 20000 satoshis now, the value of it will dramatically rise. But raw bitcoin is like trading gold bars and for everyday coffee purchases you will use the lightning network or something similar to it that transfers in milliseconds and costs no fee at all.
