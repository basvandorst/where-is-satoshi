His name is Roger Ver. He spams so he can claim that Bitcoin has a problem and that he has a solution.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:09:09
Coinbase is responsible for large chunk of all transactions (heard estimates of up to 20%)  - if they implement SW this woukd be a big, big deal. I think they will have to implement LN as otherwise they will lose out to competition fast.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:20:35
Essentialy we are entering alpha stage. Three projects I follow: lnd, c lightning and eclair are feature complete and now mostly bugs are fixed and extensive testing is performed. I would expect first officaial releases in next few months.  
  
Why not faster? Its not a matter of funding, its matter of devs: very few people on the planet are good crypto devs.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:42:25
But signatures are much longer than any overhead. This will be utxo related (small inputs).
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:05:55
Its bound to be - finally wallets, exchanges are starting to use it. Still plenty to go.

If not in rush - fire it with 61sat per byte, it should confirm, if not you will get it back when it drops from mempool in 2 weeks time or so.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:29:31

If there is no tx id - then maybe tx was never issued/ broadcasted?

LN will allow long term hodlers to get small interest on holdings. We have a lot of them. I will be willing to put my coins to a good use for next to nothing - just to help the network.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:26:54
Really good!
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:36:45
LN does not use TOR, but a form of onion routing (multiple levels of encryption).
There is no known issues with encryption itself, but nothing is perfect and for someone with considerable means (like nsa) not all is lost. They can try to analize timing of packets, data from routers they control,etc. LN in any case is way more private than layer 1 blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:25:20
Indeed, I think it could go to 40 in a day!
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:00:56
61 per byte of course
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:55
this will make sense when LN will be deployed - now, not really.

In github you can see currenly opened tickets (bugs, enhancement proposals) - this is a good indication of project state. A bit involved, but a fun thing to follow.
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:44:37
go to lnbig.com and open a free inbound channel. 
autopilots role is only to open channels, and it has no role in routing. 
LN uses source routing - where sender chooses a route and tries to make a payment. if you dont have capacity - your node will report a “temporary error” and sender will try different path.
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:28:34
TX are tiny - maybe 1kb.
You could easily have a USB stick, SD card or even Google Drive where you would keep a copy of a last valid TX. I don't see it as a big deal. Possibly LND will be configured to do it automatically. For LND node it would make sense to use RAID (so 2 hard drives with one redundancy).

| -If my computer crashes, all of my funds since the last blockchain commit (channel close) are lost.
LND stores transaction state in SQL database (SQLite as far I remember). Crash or reboot should have no negative impact at all. If your hard-drive dies - maybe. 
Some notes: Early releases of LND might have bugs, so I would not put my life savings on version 1.0. Proper installation of LND should have real-time backup of transactions.

The only people that claim that LN is difficult either have not even tried it or more likely have an agenda (see bcasiers).  If you can use Bitcoin wallet, using LN is not much different.
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:11:35
too small - such channel would be unusable anyways. I recommend putting 200k as a minimum.

Yes - go to lnbig.com and open an inbound channel for free. You can receive without having to spend anything.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:51
no, 2x guys went with Ver and don't care any more. But there is a part of the community (like me) hopping fir a Core initiated, modest block size increase/hard fork.

No, protcol does not get broken like this. Scripts are used all the time for things like multisig, segwit, etc
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:08:09
your wallet should not re-broadcast, when tx drops out of mempool your wallet should simply show state like no tx ever happened (so will allow you to spend again)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:58:20
Typicaly the oldest tx is dropped after either some time (like two weeks) or if memory/storage of the node is full. Different nodes might have slightly different rules - there is no standard for it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:00:26
bitcoin right now is not suitable for very small purchases, but there is good news: Lightning Network should be available in the first half of 2018 - that will make small and micro purchases essentially free (no miner fee, only very small LN fee).
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:32:59
  
This is an argument against on chain bloating. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:20:58
Bitcoin, ethereum - those that are in high demand and decentralised. 
If system is not in high demand or is centralised - those can have spare capacity.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:51:21
if Coinbase implements LN, you will be able to buy on Coinbase and topup your LN wallet (providing that node you opened channel with has sufficient funds). 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:53:41
when no-one used it, this is true for all alt-coins:  
alts can be decentralised and cheap to tx - only if user base is low. When user base goes high: either you centralise or have full blocks (and need off chain). examples of later: BTC and ETH
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:26:14
100% agree - no crypto talk during period! ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:10:39
If Bob is a large player he will lock larger funds, collect tx fees, and both send and receive payments (bi directional).
Bob will have an incentive to keep balance healthy (tx fees).  
In healthy LN you will havr multiple possible routes, so Bob should not be a single place of failure.  
  
As for Alice and Caol - again in LN you can send and receive payments - so maybe Alice will run out of funds, but will receive topup ftom her employer - Tom.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:40:14
Possibly once a year, if your account runs dry, you should be able to topup via LN reducing a need for on chain to almost zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:17:18
LN confusion in this post. What you are describing is a payment channel. LN is a network of channels. So if you open one channel you will be able to pay (and receive funds) to and from anyone on the network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:28
evidence is clear to see for everyone - yes if you have a deep pocket you can do it
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:38:07


  
correction: if you send from SW to SW or legacy you reap the benefits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:47:33
I agree, last time the problem was not the size increase, but who initiated it. Im all for 2mb blocks Core initiated
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:53:23
LN assumes working on chain transactions. On this assumption there is no risk even if other party does not cooperate.   
In my book its very different from IOU that fully relies on good will of the other party to release funds.

@_date: 2017-12-10 20:39:29
This should be easier: 
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:03:12
most likely limited by roundtrip/ping time. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:53:34
you can increase fee only if original TX was broadcasted with RBF flag. I would wait, fee you paid is just below what is currently being cleared from mempool - and you might be lucky.  
  
If not - transaction will be purged from mempool in around 2 weeks and you will be able to spend again.  
  
If in real rush - try TX accelerators, but you might need to pay for it.  
  
Last option - if you are sending to your own wallet, you might attempt: child pays for parent (google it).
EDIT: you are sending to the exchange, so likely not an option.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:54:49

if you want to hodl coins for a long time - paper wallet is possibly the simplest and the safest (make sure to make a backup and keep it in two separate locations).  
  
if you intend to make small investment - then phone is OK (I would say safer than a PC).  
  
if you want to hold larger funds and make transactions - buy a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:12

@_date: 2018-09-08 19:30:11
You can do it in three "levels" of involvement:  
  
- If you want to auto convert all or some BTC to FIAT:  
    
  
- SIMPLE, LN payments are converted to BTC for you:  
  
  
- PRO. You run your own bitcoin and LN node, have full control:  
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:29:48
If there is no route between channels you cant move funds (without opening a new channel).  
We will see how many channels people will have in practice - one might be sufficient, but maybe it will evolve differently.

fees are LOW:   
20sat/byte are confirmed in the next block!
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:33:39
BCH took a dogmatic position to stay with narowly definec "satoshi vision", this constrains development and will leave it as crypto-fosil. The only idea they have is to scale on chain which will lead to centralisation loosing the most important property of Bitcoin. On top of that almost zero devs. I would be amazed if this coin goes anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:31
Strange, dont use electeum, but all should be needed is a new derivation path if you are using hd wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:57:06
yes, it goes to the miners. I agree that its a lot of money. Coinbase is not using SW that would slash this fee by at least 30%.  
  
Hope in the near future coinbase will allow LN payment for small purchases. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:09:18
Unfortunately a lot of buisnesses (including coinbase) are struggling with devs.  
There are few devs on the planet that are good at crypto, a lot of them got suoer rich in the process and are not easy to retain. Heard some rummors that most exchanges (inc coinbase) run on dev teams of like two or three guys - thats it.  
This is apparently a big reason for slow feature deployment.  
  
On similar note: whole Lightning Network is developed by very small team of like 10 people. We need more devs!
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:46:58
this can happen, there are no hard rules about mempool - but most will drop the tx after few weeks, if you re-broadcast with higher fee - it should get mined no problem
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:46:34
Works great with lightning-wallet.com
Donated, this is super useful website.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:37:22
12 sat a byte is vey low fee right now - might take very long time. If its urgent consider using tx accelarator.  
I assume your tx does not allow RBF (replace by fee).
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:48
There already has been mainnet demonstration - I recommend patience, you dont want to lose your funds due to bugs.  
I follow LND development, progress is rapid!

This is a perfect answer - bravo :-)
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:53:35
I hate when people compare LN to I.O.U. IOU implies counterparty risk (what if they dont cooperate) which is not present in LN.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:07:41
I think this is a spot on analisys. I would add: if you are also a minner, you can pick your own transactions so no fee is paid for those at all.  
  
I think that full blocks are a feature of all decentralized systems (that are in high demand) - in such conditions spammimg is always relatively easy, possibly regardless of block size. Only going off chain for 99% of transactions looks like a viable solution.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:35:30
bitwallet is cool :-)
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:34:52
Yes, testnet right now. Although there was a mainnet demo couple of days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:10:34
The trouble from my perspective is that both comunities took oposite/extreme views:  
  
- 1MB is forever, no hard-forks ever on one side
- Gigabyte blocks, centralization OK, no off-chain on the other  
  
Would love some middle ground with larger blocks (even if we lose **some** nodes), powerful off-chain (even if miners are pissed off).  
  
Edit: Don't say BTG has that.... I would like BTC to move a bit
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:52:09
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:05:57
how much did you pay?   
mempool is clogged, but currently is clearing - so you might be lucky. currently all transactions that paid 140+ sat/byte got cleared - as we have a holiday season (lower traffic) mempool might empty (unless Ver will start spamming again).
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:11:59
It's marketed as Bitcoin wallet - but if you install it by default will create BCash wallet only, no even an option for Bitcoin.
You need to go to ADVANCED SETTINGS to enable "Bitcoin Core".  
   
  
It's a clear SCAM - and I hope Google will keep it banned until Ver renames it to "BCash wallet" to avoid confusion.  
Let's remember that Google has an obligation to keep Play Store free from malware and scams.

As difficulty goes up- your incone will go down, thats how all mining hardware becomes eventually obsolete (unprofitable to operate, unless you have free electricity). S9 should be profitable for maybe 2 years (guess).
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:26:51
Read about SW, My statement is correct, SW transactions get a big discount for space taken by sinatures.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:23:09
And thats the problem - to fix malleability you need to move signatures from the block - this is a definition of Segwit. They already shuting down any other proposals like flex transactions - as those are just a variation of segwit. BCash will become a fosil of satoshi vision.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:01:41
Educate yourself: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:06
maybe - I would argue this is a property of all decentralised and popular systems. In ETH it's Kitties that are doing the damage.

@_date: 2017-12-09 22:02:15
When you make a SW tx (to legacy or sw address, does not matter) - you can pay a lower fee today, no need to wait for the whole network to upgrade.  
As signatures are much cheaper in SW tx - you can pay lower fee that you would have to pay in legacy tx.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:32
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:09:19
SW is a protocol upgrade - you get a cheaper fees but not a game changer so adoption is slow. LN is absolutely a game changer, and for services that will be slow to adopt there will be a price: lost customers. I think LN will be rapidely adopted by merchants and wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:45:31
LN is developed for both BTC and LTC (code base is almost the same, both have SW). Others are much more difficult, LN implementation is using heavily SW, bitcoin opt codes, etc.  
BCash will never have LN that allows to receive payments (without SW BCash wallet has to be onlime all the time - so not practical), sending payments is possible but whats the point they want to bloat the chain instead.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:37:21
It provides much more privacy as tx is not broadcasted. Internet is still required, especialy when more than two parties are involved. LN should enable things that we never really had in the past - like nano payments (pay 1 usd cent to read an article, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:18:02
What kind of feedback the other party had?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:27:12
Whole point of BCash is to reject segwit. They will never add it.
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:57:04
BCash has nothing to do with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:19:38
I agree - while massive on chain scalling (BCH vision) is dangerous and will lead to centralisation, a very mild increase (like to 2mb) would benefit bitcoin greatly.  
On chain scalling is kicking a can down the road, but sometimes this is needed to sllow timefor development and deployment of better tech (ln).  
I would love to see 2mb hardfork - initiated by core and suppoted by the comunity.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:15:44
Good luck :-)
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:11:16

tx pressure lead to increase in fees:
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:14:07
LN has no bearing on on-chain processing nodes. Where on chain scaling will lead to centralisation. Ver admits that he will be happy with few dozen nodes on the planet. That's a definition of PayPal.  
  
Ver is obsessed with preserving "cash" as stated title of Bitcoin white-paper: "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", but in the process he is happy to lose "peer-to-peer" keyword.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:19:26
legacy &lt;-&gt; segwit is 100% fully compatible, no need to worry. but you get cheaper transactions ONLY if you send from SegWit (to SW or legacy)

good news: you will not lose your money. bad news: it's unlikely to be mined so you will get it back into your wallet when nodes will purge it from the mempool (you will be able to spend it again in the future).

Show me one decentralised network with really high tx volume that has low fees then.

In such case Bob will not be a viable route. Wallet will have two options:

35 satoshi is a lot for LN - still 10 times cheaper than the cheapest on chain tx. 
I suspect you are correct that payment went trough expensive or multiple hops. Still total cost is 0.0024usd or quarter of 1 cent. Unfairly cheap!

Some bcasiers were spreading fud that swaps are allowing of inflation of BTC in LN. “Look Im swapping bcash for LN, so ln is inflating in supply” this is NOT how swaps work. 
In nutshell: you can pay me with an alt so I will move my EXISTING funds in LN to pay an LN invoice. This can happen without any fancy infrastructure. For example: give me an apple and I will pay you a satoshi.place invoice. 
What submarine swaps accomplish is to do the swap trustlessly 
@_date: 2018-08-05 08:39:05
YES, Its today the cheapest way to move any crypto that's for sure.  
This opens huge number of new use cases, especially for micro payments. But its also great for regular merchants as LN fees are immune to any potential congestion (and fee spikes) in the base layer (plus no need to wait for tx confirmation and good privacy)

zero-conf is not safe in decentralised systems (when tx is in mempool its easy to broadcast another that spends the same coins). miners can mine one/any of those and invalidate the other. 
This might be a low risk, but this is a reason why merchants that deliver digital goods in particular (steam vouchers, crypto exchanges, etc) require confirmation(s). 
In other words: we can’t replace Visa with system that is more flaky and less secure. LN does not have double spend problem. Bitrefill.com for example allows to topup a phone and pay with crypto - they will deliver your order instantly only of you pay with LN.

There is no hard limit, so moving few thousands should not be an issue.  
One caveat:  
LN is using a different fee structure than base layer - in ln you pay a small percentage of value transacted, in base layer its fixed cost based on size of transaction in bytes.  
  
This means that ln is perfect for small payments (lets say below 1000usd). Above that you might find that sending payment on base layer is cheaper. For small payments (like 1usd) fees are typically like 1satoshi in total, but for 5000 usd this could be like 500 satoshi (comparable to on chain fee).

there are few smaller exchanges (like bitbargain.co.uk) that already integrated LN
bigger buys are experimenting now. I suspect that we will see more movements when watchtowers will be developed (as this will allow for all wallets (mobile, spv) to receive payments - important for exchanges. 
No ETA but my guess: at least one big guy by the end of this year. 
On side note: exchanges are interested in using LN for inter-exchange settlements (using large, private channels). This would allow for instant, free, non custodian transfers. We might see this use case before LN for retail customers. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:05:36

There is one piece missing (in development) called watchtowers. This is a service that allows mobile to be off line and to issue penalty transaction on your behalf  if the other party tries to cheat.
There is also a thread of development called eltoo - that proposes a new opt code sig_noinput that would make watchtowers much easier to implement, and requiring even less trust.

Incredible security of Bitcoin is what separates it from most alts. If we change POW we lose one of the best features of BTC, at that point might as well use BCC as all this mining equipment will have to be deployed somewhere.

this is my understanding as well. for this reason LN is best suited for micro or small payments. For large transactions you will still go on-chain route. LN routing protocol should take care of finding a path that has sufficient balance.

POW change requires:  
- hard fork  
- updating all the nodes, wallets, apps, etc, etc  
- finding someone to run GPU mining to make network secure  
- will have to be done very quickly (as with no hashrate BTC will not be working)  
  
Where is any effort yo achieve all of this, test the new code, etc? Looks like a wishful thinking to me. POW change will be a suicide. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:45:52
Segwit will have only small impact on fees, or help to reduce mempool size.
Segwit enables however deployment of Lghtning networks and over time those should reduce fees at almost zero - timescales are unknown.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:34:44
When spending a transaction with multiple inputs, you need to include in your TX multiple signatures. This is what makes transaction expensive. In SW signatures are 4x cheaper to broadcast. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:38:50
Changed some details but principle is the same;)
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:19:38
answer is a bit more complicated than that:  
* there is no minimum in theory but  
* most nodes will not relay your tx if see is less than 1 sat/byte (so your tx is unlikely to even reach a miner)  
* if your tx reaches a miner, it's 100% up to them to include it in a block or not, but I would say it's unlikely if you pay less than 1sat/byte  
  on a final note. if you want to pay less than 1sat/byte - use LN, it works today and most fees I pay are like 1 satoshi in TOTAL (not per byte).
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:04:29

it makes sense to move tor hot wallet (one you use to make frequent transactions). fees will be cheaper, no reason to move cold storage.

@_date: 2017-08-27 14:35:59

It's not perfect (rushed, etc) - but I'm for it.
I'm a big believer in LN but as I'm a software developer by trade - I think it might take quite some time for LN to be developed, tested, deployed and widely used. Until then 2X sounds like a beneficial change.

Im not "totally" fine with 2x - given POW change or 2x - I see 2x as less disruptive.  
Both scenarios are bad, POW one is insane.

share transaction id - otherwise I can only guess
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:53:00
transactions with a lot of inputs are cheaper in Segwit, as each input has a signature and those in SW cost 25%. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:01:19
malware? keyloggers? etc?
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:58:35
I think it will tale few months before we will have significant number of transactions on SW - devs have to update wallets, people start using it, etc. 
I think it will start gaining when mayor players will make SW address a default one. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:51:40
There will be NO economic activity if BTC will be left with 10% hashrate and one block per an 90 minutes or so. Whole thing will collapse as transactions will not confirm for weeks. 
  
  
Talk about change if POW I hear around is mad - "we dont want 2x hardfork, we will do POW hardfork instead" - we know whays is the impact of larger blocks (fewer nodes), whats the impact of firing all the miners snd starting new mining from scratch? Insane...
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:25:32
in coming weeks your favourite wallet should add support of SW. In particular you should be able to generate SW address to receive coins (those start with digit three). Use it instead of legacy address (starting with digit one). 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:08:08
because its true. segwit2x has support or part of the community and most of the miners - no support from core developers. this means a hard fork.

not really, most likely LN will be built into almost every wallet. You will have an option to send on-chain (slow and relatively expensive), or using LN (instant and very cheap). This will be a bit like saving and checking account.

open channels with some decent amount of BTC, keep your node alive, keep software up-to-date. your node will be used for routing, if you are reliable and have decent capacity others will connect to you (give it some time).

and how do we know which one is first? If more than one is injected to different nodes at the same time? There is also NOTHING on consensus level to force miners to pick one transaction over the other one. They typically pick first one they see (other miners can see tx in opposite order), but there is nothing stopping miners mining one that for example has a higher fee (block will still be valid)
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:27:26

yes - it's possible technically to create a channel where both party contribute some funds (not only you) - but right now no wallet/node supports that. Would be nice if when you open a channel - remote node pushed some very small amount - so we can test facets.

All im saying that its an old graph when network was in its infancy. A lot has changed in last 18 months [tm].
I use LN every day and it simply works - at this point you're just spreading old fud.

I agree that lack of replay protection is an issue.  
Im not sure if 1x chain will be viable if 90% of miners disappear.  Transactions will not confirm for weeks, price would crash for that reason alone.  
  
If there will be POW change or not it might be difficult time either way.  
  
The only sensible solution would be for Core devs and NY signatories to talk to each other - but both sides would need some good will, very little of that recently.

Open channels (both private and public) are visible on the Bitcoin ledger as a regular 2-2 P2SH multisig - I don't beleive there is any relable way to detect those. It's easier to detect unooperative close transactions (as those will have a time-lock) - but this is rare occurence and happens only when channel is closed so not helpful in detecting current private channel count.

This graph was done at the very inception of LN when most channels had like 5USD in capacity so chances of routing larger payments were initially low. This quickly changed as much larger channels were allowed. Today paying 100$ works every time. For larger payments use L1.
Obviously AMP (atomic multipath payments) will improve this even further.

there are two out-sync scenarios:  
- simple network issue: this will resolve itself as nodes constantly talk to each other relaying blocks and transactions. if you miss something it will be rebroadcasted.   
  
- consensus change: some nodes change consensus rules (see BitmainCash fork), in such case your node will validate the block, see that is invalid and discard it

LN watchtowers - good news, you dont need to trust any third party. You can run watchtower yourself.
Also - if you paranoid and dont trust one watchtower you can send your tx to multiple watchtowers at the same time for redundancy.

Zero conf allows double or triple or quadruple spend attempts (you spend coins in multiple places at the same time and hope merchant will hand over goods before detecting double spend in mempool). Miners will mime only one of those attempts. Thats why we have mining and blocks in the first place. So zero conf is not a base for sound money.

Many options here:  
- for small merchants, just use service like  (they will worry about channels, capacity, etc).  
- if you want to run node yourself open one large channel, then use  to push funds to your peer. tip: In ln.zone you can specify a btc address that will fund another ln channel - this way instead of receiving btc to your wallet - you will open another ln channel.  
- in the future there will be nodes that will allocate funds to your channel (maybe for some small fee).  
- after you all set up, allow your node to route payments, set fees in a way that will keep your channels balanced (fees can be different depending on direction of a payment)

Agreed 100%.  
  
And if any company would like to subvert the process by paying devs that do something against community wishes - we will not run such code (see S2X). Blockstream has been funding proper development and been on a right side of history. This does not mean we should trust anyone and always be vigilant.

Bitcoin dev scene is a small group, of course anyone prominent will be one way or another involved in mayor discussions or development. Blockstream employed Pieter Wuille and he has been instrumental in base layer improvements like taproot and shnorr. They also invested a lot in liquid - its 100% their product.
Back to examples of scaling without blockstream:
Luke Dashjr is not working for Blockstream was instrumental in Segwit development.
Rootstock (rsk) has nothing to do with Blockstream (to my knowledge).
I agree that BS plays an important role in funding some exceptional individuals (Wuille, Rusty, etc), this is to be applauded. I feel however that saying that BS steers Bitcoin is overstating their influence.

LND has a subsytem that remember routing failures. If node fails to route or is slow it will not be used again even if promises zero fees. So its not really an effective attack, at least not against recent versions of lnd. Fool me one approach.  
  
On top of that lnd priorities routes that worked in the past, even if a bit more expensive, so just opening bunch of new channels  is not likely to sway existing nodes to use those (unless no other route is available, or node has no successful past payments done on this route)  
  
Subsystem in lnd is called Mission Control. Example o recent improvements:

The trouble is that fee paid (1 sat/byte) in no way represents a true cost of processing and forever storing this information by the whole network. They get away with spammy, parricidal use of Bitcoin as blocks are empty and fees low. 
Bitcoin should be reserved for transferring money - but as you rightly point, there is no way to force it. Historically higher fees weed out spammers (like satoshi dice used to be a problem in the past).

fee updates are very infrequent in practice.
one way to probe network activity would be to open few big, well connected network nodes and set low fees. 
Some people would use you for routing and although you will not be able to know the details of the payments (like source, destination - due to onion encryption). By observing routing activity of your node you could try to estimate overall network traffic or long time trends. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:00:14

@_date: 2019-02-09 20:41:14

Indeed this is what I heard. Would be great if he publishes a detailed article of this calculation so it can be discussed. This should include estimation of impact if we keep current block size and decrease it. 
Until then Im not convinced price we would have to pay for this fork (community spit, fees when LN is still very young, etc) is worth paying. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:36:58

Lukes proposal is clearly controversial and can lead to split of the community and maybe new fork/alt. Last thing we need.
  
Also: why 300kb not 30kb?
Lets keep it as it is - I run a full node and understand some concerns (like initial sync) but we need to have breathing room until LN takes hold.

AFIK they use OP_RETURN as part of the tx so looking at growth if this opt code might give an indication (not perfect). When they used testnet - something like 80% of tx was by them. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:07:54
Some good questions here (and some common misunderstandings).  
  
1) Yes - if you open a channel a TX is broadcasted on blockchain. What you actually do is create a multisig address and fund it (load funds onto it).  
  
2) I would expect users to have one or two open channels all the time to facilitate purchases. Channel allows you to make multiple payments and also RECEIVE payments from others.  
  
When you have channel open you can pay ANYONE who is using LN. So if you have channel open with Amazon - you can still pay someone on ebay (no need to open new channel). This is the meaning of word "Network" in "Lightning Network"  
  
3) It's not instant, it's simple bitcoin TX. It's up to the other party if they require confirmations (and how many). In practice we might need to open a new channel only once or twice a year - so mining time should not be an issue.  
  
4) LN is a little like internet infrastructure with routers, hubs and direct connections. All that YOU need to do is open a channel with someone that is connected to other nodes. It does not have to be a hub or anything big. Now the important thing: It's YOUR WALLET that is responsible to create a route (you are in control of the route). So if you want to avoid large hubs - you can do it.  
In practice it might not matter - LN is using onion routing (a bit like TOR network), this means that if your route passes via large hub - this hub does not know source and destination of funds (only the next hop) and can't steal the funds.  
  
5/6) No this should not happen. We will most likely have one network that implements LN protocol and everyone can accept payments from everyone.  
  
Hope this helps,

there are few really:  
- if drop is not huge, TX fees will go up making mining more profitable  
- difficulty will re-adjust after some time anyways (just might take much longer than usual)  
- if all fails, and delay between blocks is just too much - we could always hardfork to change PoW and save the chain

No its not the same, RBF is not a scalling solution, does not allow larger blocks.

@_date: 2017-11-25 07:59:14

@_date: 2017-11-22 12:21:26
i understand- my point is: you already have the infrastructure, run LN node when those will be available on main net - this help the network and allows for income.  
  
giving revenue to non-mining nodes was discussed many times in the past and there is no consensus for it. I have not seen any decent proposal how this could work in practice.

Mempool is empty - don't use wallet estimation for high fee, select custom from the "Transaction Fees" drop-down and select something like 5 sat/byte. Wallets are often VERY conservative (expensive) if you select "fast confirmation" option, it's not uncommon that calculated fee will be 100 times more than real fee needed.

I think community is uneasy about level of centralisation right now - but not to the point to ask for immediate PoW change. Hope is that those will help somewhat:  
- ASIC boost now not an issue now  
- more companies involved in manufacture of miners (Bitmain monopoly seems to be ending)  
- more geographical spread of miners (China is less welcoming to miners, so other countries are getting involved like Canada)

Recent price drop has nothing to do with bcash fork hashrate redirection.
Maybe 4% of hashrate was redirected for 24hours or so - not even noticed by the network.

not automatically. but channel can become unbalanced. for example we have Alice and Bob, if Bob just kept paying Alice - at some point all funds will be with Alice snd Bob cant pay any more. This is unbalanced channel, one option is to close it and open new channel (on chain tx), but other option is to try to rebalance it, by sending payments to 3rd party (Mark) via route: Alice-&gt; Bob -&gt; Mark (if one is available).  
  
Alice can set zero or negative fees for her leg to encourage others to send funds this way - as this rebalanced Alice-&gt;Bob channel.

Fortunately bitcoin.com pools has essentially next to no hashrate - so damage is very limited. Of course it's political to be able to claim that Bitcoin "is broken" when in fact he is actively trying (and failing) to break it.

**public** ledger is well...... public.
LN will allow us much greater privacy for small payments.
There are also serious efforts to develop private transactions  for on-chain. Efforts are focused on makin those tx as small as possible (right now typical tx is around 3 times bigger - so wasting a lot of block space). 
  
So hopefully BTC will be much more private in close future!

yes:  
- lock some small funds in it  
- make sure to update lnd from time to time  
- your node will facilitate payments for others, and you can collect some small payments (or maybe make it free)?

Current ersion of LN spec (1.0) uses very simple gossip protocol just to get things going. Gossip will most likely be replaced or heavily modified in the futue and work already started on this (ideas beign discussed discussed).  Its quite likely that we will have something like DNS services that will monitor network and help with routing - that woukd allow for massive scalling and quick route discovery. But who knows how this will evolve - routing will be one of the most exciting areas of research.

For me this video is also a reminder that on chain is not private right now. LN would solve it for small payments, and fingers crossed on chain will also get some improvements (already in pipeline).

One possible reason for lower fees:  
Big players got smarter on how to create TXes. For example localbitcoins.com used to create one TX, just for you when you withdrew your BTC. Now they create one TX periodically - with many outputs (paying for example 50 people in one go).   
  
This is still counted as one TX - even though its paying 50 people. This one TX is large, but smaller in size and cheaper than 50 individual ones. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:33:35
I think I get it. In other words: the fact that recetly transactions tend to contain more inputs and outputs than in the past, SW alone will have a bigger impact than previously thought?

overt asic boost is ok - Bitmain used covert one (that is not compatible with segwit, so they blocked it)

no thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:41:10
yes in two ways:  
- if you have a recovery seed created during paper wallet creation (12/18 or 24 words) then you can import those to nano directly (using restore wallet option).  
- otherwise create new wallet on nano, import your private key to some other wallet (like coinomi on android) and send funds to nano.

it would be equivalent of having 1.35x capacity before segwit.

no problems at all - sent multiple transactions, and received sone as well using ledger nano. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:21:44
I would generate the wallet using offline device to start with. If you want to store large funds - send maybe some small amount first and wait a week, if it's still there then you could be 99.99999% sure that wallet is safe.  
  
Having said all of that: I recommend using hardware wallet like trezor or ledger nano - those will generate a HD wallet for you, and seed and private keys will never leave the device, never will be on your PC or transmitted to printer. Paper wallet is equally safe if generated on offline device though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:27:32
If you can pay 2 sat/byte and got confirmation in the next block - its empty in my book. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:58:25
No you don’t need to have a computer running 24/7. This is especially true if you only spend from your ln wallet. In such situation if someone broadcasts old tx - they will refund you.  
  
If you receive funds in ln channel - something should keep an eye on blockchain if old tx is not broadcasted trying to steal funds, this can be your wallet, or a third party (for a small fee). Ability to have a third party is a whole reason for SegWit, without it you will have to watch the chain 24/7.   
  
Bottom line: LN is nothing short of revolutionary!
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:34:00
Thats the beauty of LN - its much more private tha n on-chain. No block explorers!
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:06:55
Depends if it’s deployed as hard or soft fork.  
I suspect we will have a soft fotk, so it will be similar to how segwit works (signature will be segregated, new op code to do a schnorr check). if my guess is true - It will appear as “anyone can spend” to pre-segwit nodes, so expect bcash shills to spread FUD around :-)
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:22:23
No one really knows how the next fork will play out. It might have zero impact if NYA will fall apart, or might have a huge impact if almost all miners will leave main chain. In such case BTC will need a hard fork and PoW change (this will impact usability and price).  
  
Myself I will hodl and see where it goes! 
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:20:47
this. wallet is not that important, if someone enters pin incorrectly few times, it will wipe itself.

my understanding is that at 100% segwit transactions block size would be around 1.7MB. As SW transactions are only few bytes larger than non sw, that would mean around 1.6x maybe close to 1.7x tx capacity increase. Am I missing something? (im quoting block size not weight as this should be in any case close to 4MB).

This is essentially a defragmentation of utxo. When fees were high last year a lot of exxhanges ended up in funds locked in dust utxos (small values so not worth spending). Now that fees are essentially 1sat/byte a lot of busses are consolidating those dusts.  
  
See this chart:

(not 100% sure):  channel time has two properties:  
- its maximum amount of time you have to wait to get s refund if other party is NOT cooperating (should be very rare).  
- it discourages broadcasting old state of the channel (as the other party will be penalised if they broadcast old state and you broadcast current state).  
  
if both parties cooperate, they can close the channel without waiting (create transaction with zero wait time).  
  
regarding extension of the deadline: i'm not sure (will have to consult the white-paper), maybe someone here can comment - will be interesting to know

fees are not related to value of transaction, but size in bytes (the more inputs and outputs you have the more you will pay), and how fast you want it to be confirmed (if you don't mind waiting you can go for a low fee).  
Another consideration: are you spending from legacy or segwit wallet (sw will be cheaper).

I think changing PoW would be very damaging. Ecosystem is very slow to adapt (wallets, exchanges, applications, arms, etc) - good example is relatively slow segwit rollout. It's one thing to have well planned hardfork (not saying 2x is one), where software is updated well ahead of time, it's completely different thing to have emergency hardfork - sure Core devs can update code for reference node and wallet, but how long would entire ecosystem need to catch up?  
In such environment I fear BTC can easily loose dominance, acceptance and relevance.  
  
My ideal scenario: core devs and ny signatories should meet for talks and come to some arrangement - I know it will not happen as there is very little good will on both sides.... :-(

There will be a price to pay: lost nodes, more centralisation. Is it worth it? Right now not in my opinion.  LN, MAST, Schnorr signatures should allow us a lot of room to grow without bloating the chain.

@_date: 2017-09-24 18:25:05
i think it's fair to say that without LN all coins have the same problem:  
  
- allow bigger and bigger block size (you have to keep increasing it)  
this will lead to centralization of nodes - and will make it easier for autorities to shut you down (see recent China crackdown)  
  
  &amp;nbsp;
- keep the blocks small  
this increases fees / transaction but makes you much more censonship resistant  
  
BTC is more concerned with censorship and aims to allow miro-payments via LN, other coins like BCH are willing to take risk with lower decentralisation.  
    
  &amp;nbsp;
LN has one more advantage from my point of view: allows for privacy. I'm not that keen on recording every single my purchase on public ledger for everyone to see - forever. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:18:54

Breaking change in lnd requiring to close channels before upgrade? Guessing, but it happened in the past few times (on testnet).  
  
ps: After release 1.0 there should be no breaking changes like that.

coinbase pays multiple people with one TX, this reduces fees but it takes few minutes for the transfer to be initiated. sometimes it might take longer if their hot wallet is running low snd they need to activate cold storage coins
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:52:11
i get this all the time - 2FA and they have no chance
@_date: 2017-09-29 10:56:15
how so? if both X2 and Core would follow X2?chain split would be avoided. There still would be a hard fork, but no chain split.  Of course this is very unlikely to happen. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:08:21
If someone broadcasts old tx - its timelocked for HIM, buy you have a private key and can claim whole channel ballance (his and your money) without having to wait. So there is a huge risk and penality in broadcasting old tx.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:31:14
Looks like there are two factors to slow deployment:  
- SW activation looked unlikely for a very long time, so wallets put no effort into supporting it, then UASF and 2X happened out of the blue surprising people  
- then Bitcoin Cash happened - this time pulling developer resources away from SW so BCH is supported. 
  
Hope they can focus on it now!
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:26:08
the most efficient might be a hodl algorithm - easy to implement as well :-)

Have you watched the video? Its trivaial to trace all your tx from the moment you purchased coins (typicaly via exchange that knows your name). If you think that btc is anonymous then you might be surprised.

Indeed! :-)

@_date: 2017-09-22 12:03:56
you can do it in two transactions.  
in other words A can pay as many people as you wish in one TX. This is used by for example coinbase: they will make one TX that credits multiple people to handle withdrawals. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:46:10
if address starts with 1 - it will not be a segwit address  
if address starts with 3 - it can be a segwit, but it might also be non-segwit P2SH (commonly used for multi-sig for example):   
  
unless coins from the address are spent (exposing redeemScript) - it's not possible to know if 3 address is SW or not.
@_date: 2018-11-17 19:25:18
transactions in LN are not recorded in any public database - so it's not possible to get accurate numbers (and its a good thing for privacy).
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:52:20
fully agree, my mum would not use this.  
she uses contactless credit cards: instant, no fees, no confirmation times - as long as BTC will not at least match this experience there will be no mass adoption 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:12:03
the fee for that would be quite sizeable! ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:03:38
what?  
safest way is possibly to taint coins with newly minted coins post fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:32:27
"ninOr" milestone :)
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:04:55
For all the differences - I'm glad you guys are mining SW transactions, cheers!
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:45:40
yes, it would require a hardfork.  
essentially to have replay protection one or the other side has to change consensus rules. this can be done with hardfork only
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:02:57
even better - LN allows for negative fees.  
this can be useful if node wants to rebalance a channel in particular direction (already experimented with on testnet).
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:26:31
in 2010 there was no HD wallets as far I remember, you will need a wallet.dat file, or private keys
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:35:02
not a SW address - it needs to start with "3" not "1"
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:54:02
there is nothing centralised "by design" - but LN might evolve to have number of large hubs that most people use, or might not. Even in large hub system, hub will not be able to steal your money so I dont have a problem with it. 
  
I guess it might be similar like with mining: to start with it was very distributed (CPU mining) and over time it git more centralised along with resources to mine. This might be similar (or might not) - we will see :-)

@_date: 2017-09-19 10:55:08
To consolidate one would choose weekend when its always quiet and fees are very low. Unless paying 15BTC in fees is not a problem for someone. Looks like a "stress test for me" - but cant be sure. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:50:18
Segwit, unless you are creating paper wallet for long term hodling - in such case it does not matter much.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:30:56
EDA too away hashrate - should finish in few hours
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:02:44
Yes, the only consideration is lack of replay protection - if you spend coins on one chain you can loose the same coins on the other chain.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:38:04
LN will solve that
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:58:14

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:42:25
Keep it in hardware or paper wallet
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:52:11
one way would be to send newly minted coins available on one chain only - and then create a tx that includes it - you cant replay that in the other chain. that should work I believe.  
so maybe miners will allow purchase of few "freshly mined" satoshi :-)
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:58:27
Good video but the title is wrong. Video describes payment channel. LN is a network of payment channels with whole routing protocol- this is not even mentiined in the video. This creates a common missconceptiin that in LN you can pay only one person per channel.

@_date: 2017-10-10 11:09:19
Coinomi uses a HD wallet that will use a different address each time. Most likely address you look at is just one of many in your wallet

This sounds great to me. +1 Adam!
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:28:20
you are forgetting EDA, it's clear that miners are colluding to stop mining for around 12 hours so EDA kicks in - reducing the difficulty and increasing profit.

Just buy and hodl until retirement ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:48:30
Link above is out of date - replay protection was added and then removed. If you do nothing after the fork there will be either just one chain alive or if two survive there should emerge some way of making safe transaction. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:13:03
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:29:12
there is like 10 threads about it.  
  
Number of exchanges shut down deposits and withdrawals for 24 hours around Bitcoin Gold fork.  
  
Fork is complete now and as expected volume of SW tx is recovering, it can take a day or two for graph catch up as it displays 144 rolling average.  
  
if anything this graph shows that big players are driving SW adoption. End users lag mostly due to still patchy SW support in wallets. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:14:51
This used to be true, but now if you watch iplayer you have to have a TV licence. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:03:17
What are you describing is "payment channels" where one user (you) have a single channel (grocery store) and opens another channel with some other store, etc.  
  
LN is a **network of payment channels**. This means that you can open ONE channel and pay multiple people, and receive payments from multiple people. This is the meaning of word **network** in Lightning Network.  
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:17:50
Well, maybe. But for BTC to have mass adoption we have to have a better privacy. LN is a step in right direction.

Ledger does, not sure about the others
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:44:53
Number of pools limiting to 1mb is shrinking (for example bitcoin.com started to mine large blocks recently), but there are few holdouts.  
I suspect this is a political statement - those pools wanted bigger blocks, and opposed segwit - they choose to show the displeasure by flustrating block size increases provided by segwit. Hope this will stop sooner or later and everyobe will mine blicks above 1mb. There is aldo bw.com - the only pool that does nit mine any sw transactions,
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:36:48

Segwit activated on 24th of August - BTC dominance was 45%. Since then SW got 17% adoption and dominance grew by 14% (to around 59% today).  
So for 1% SW adoption we get 0.8% of market dominance.  
  
I know, I know - this is just a bit of fun...... or is it?? ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:23:57
Why would you mine on bitcoin.com?  
This pool is configured never to create blocks bigger than 1mb to prevent BTC scalling.

XRP or Ripple - is an alt coin. Nothing to do with Bitcoin. If you want to store alt-coins ledger seemst to be more versatile 
@_date: 2017-10-07 07:11:12
Yes, to withdraw you need to wait after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:30:13
yes, if transaction has multiple small inputs, it will   be large - as you pay fee per byte - it will cost more. If you spend from segwit address fee will be lower.  some people wait when mempool is empty and create large tx to combine many "dust" inputs into one large address- this can be cheap. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:14:07
Good job!
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:59:53
Yes tax is due on every trade, even if you trade crypto for crypto. Depending on a country you can also account for your loses so: tax = ((profit-loses)*some threshold)-gains free threshold
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:13:03
miners are still important in LN. To open and close LN channel you need on-chain transaction (and to pay tx fee). LN is not well suited for large payments- those most likely be still done on-chain.  
  
Its true that we have fewer on-chain transactions, but utility of BTC will increase opening new use cases - so more users, more tx, etc

LN development increased hugely after SW was activated - currently alpha tests are conducted on testnet3 for lnd and various other tools. Specifications for LN (called BOLTs) are essentially complete - now its implementation and testing phase.  
I believe we are around 1 year away from first wallet integrations working on real BTC network.

I think there are currently even bigger problems:  
- Bitcoin.com is mining SW transactions, but they configured they software never to create blocks bigger than 1MB. Roger Ver CEO of Bitcoin.com is an advocate of large blocks, so not sure why? (Pagging Roger maybe he can comment:  - BW.com and 1Hash are not mining SW at all  
- we still get ocasional empty block, even if mempool is far from being empty (to be far it has been an issue like forever)
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:46:01
That used to be much more frequent in the past, quite rare now.  
What irritates me more is around 30% of hashrate not creating blocks bigger than 1mb (they mine sw, but limit the block size).

More hash rate is not the answer - as difficulty will adjust to keep block time at 10 minutes.  
What will help:  
- use segwit for transaction  
- more segwit support ftom wallets  
- many miners do mine segwit transactions, but limit the block size to 1mb - this needs to stop  
  
In medium term there are improvrments like LN, MAST, Schnoor signatures to scale the network - segwit is only the begining
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:30:16
Note how we used info from sources like reddit. 
Imagine how hack of coinbase could leak adresses and names of customers - allowing to track large portion of btc users on the planet. If you buy things with btc merchant can match your address to your name and track you from that point on, etc, etc. Its a public ledger, there is little anonimity here.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:03:54
yes - not doing any trades is the safest way. airdrop/fork happens automatically- no need to do anything. information about replay protection is already out of date - there was a bug in this 2X code and change has been reversed - as far I know there is no replay protection at all.

Bitcoin is a PUBLIC LEDGER, all your transactions are public.
While it's possible to reduce ability to co-relate your transactions (like by not re-using address) it can be relatively easy to track users if someone is dedicated enough (for example law enforcement).  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
See this video what is possible:   
  &amp;nbsp;
  
This is one of the reasons why I'm happy that Lightning Network is being developed - it will allow some of your transactions to be done off-chain, increasing privacy. I'm not keen on every purchase I made to be recorded on public ledger for eternity.

Its sensible behaviour. It absolutely makes no sense for a miner to create large block with total fees collected in region of 1usd. Such block will be slow to propagate risking loss of block reward.

Well placed, well connected node can make some money. I think there was an article somewhere dissecting routing fees earned by Alex Bosworth based on this tweet:
  
  
Alex in on course to get 0.4% return per annum on his LN funds. This is pretty good at this early state of the network - but he is an LN wizard as well.  
  
Run a node to learn about the tech, to help the network, to experience financial freedom.

LN is likely to already have more tx than BCash, and much cheaper - having said that Roger will never back down. His pride would not allow him to admit he was wrong. Others around him (like J. Wu) will leave BCash train wreck quietly.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:30:18
Depending on the length of the seed (how many words).  
For Bip39 seeds - not having 1 word requires 2049 brute gorce checks, not having 2 is 2049^2 ect.
So if your seed is 12 words snd you give 6 to your wife - it can bd cracked by 2049^6 guesses .
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:51:24
yes, but only if you are a big miner (otherwise other miners will mine your expensive tx).  
note - this does not apply to LN (miners lose power in second layer) - so use it!
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:20:07


Well yes and no. When one party broadcasts old transaction you can punish them by taking all the coins form the channel. You have to do it within a window that is defined at the time of opening the channel. This window is defined as number of blocks (for example 1000 blocks, not time in hours). So at the event of low hash rate you will have a much longer time (in hours) to catch the offender.  
  
Of course it only matters if you receive any coins in LN channel. If you only spend - then you dont need to monitor for old broadcasts (as old broadcast would refund you the money).

no crypto is capable of handling huge traffic on chain only (especially for micro tx). Those that claim they can - dont handle any significant traffic. BTC has an answer: Lightning Network.  
 
The only problem: its still in development and will take another year or so before commercial developments. 
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:59:32
there is no limit how many tx can be done in one channel. i have one that is 1 yeard old, around 400tx, was refilled via LN twice. 
on top of that you will be able to open channels that are backed by for example liquid network not only main chain

Some of the channels open by this node have a lot of money, but only 14 blocks time lock on the other size.

This is quite risky. Use default 144 blocks for larger value channels.

I opened a channel with this node - it routes payments very well (loads of liquidity). I will not be receiving (only spending) via this channel as I dont trust this guy. If you spend only - there is no need for watchtowers, or zero risk to your money. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:23:59
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:25:37
This is a good guide: 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:34:41
No. In ideal world you would open lets say two channels: one with your large grocery store and one more with amazon.com. When making a LN payment to someone else (lets say me) your walet will attempt to establish a route to me and will query both channels you have already opened. If there exists a path between you and me (might take number of hops) - we can transact on LN, if not we can always transact on chain. Your employer does not have to open channel with you - if they can reach you using thd same method.  
Its a bit like tcp/ip - you dont need a dedicated line to google.com to visit their site. all you need is one (or more internet connection) and for routers to find the best route to the destination.  
  
Because you can send and receive funds your channel can stay open for very long time avoiding on chain fees. You will pay LN routing fees that should be much lower (and your walet will be able to discover cheapest routre).  
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:28:25

@_date: 2017-10-08 19:31:12
LN does not require hubs. Its ptp network. So if you have a channel open with for example any merchant, and this merchant has channel open with someone else, you can reuse this channel. So as long as connection can be established, even if it takes 20 hops, payment can be made. Parties in between dont know your identity. Everybody talks about hubs, but those are not required, might emerge for convenience, but not crtical.

Even with hubs, it will be more private than fully public block chain.  Its not about perfect privacy but minimizing number of paries involved.

@_date: 2017-10-09 13:32:26
Not really. In LN hub, or payment channel you have open does not need to know your identity.   Your wallet will be responsible to select route, if you select more than 3 hops - no one will know who you are paying to (ln implement onion routing similar to tor:   
On top of that you have access to private keys so ln hub cant steal your money (paypal can).  
  
So all in all more like bit torrent on tor than paypal.

he is competing against maximalists (like me!) that are happy to route for 1 satoshi. it's a free market, so if you put prices up - you will be routed around.
either way - he is unlikely to make any money. Maybe in the future when more wallets support LN by defult and traffic grows 1000x
@_date: 2019-09-05 17:49:51
There has been a lot of testing done over the years and results show that blocks over few megs propagate much slower. Huge blocks (as bcash sv deminstrated) have a very high orphan rate. 
Where difference between few kb and 1mb is almost non existent.
1mb is possibly chosen for this reason, this allows also to collect any reasonable fees where rejecting all other spam.
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:15:52
Yes I agree, but  Watch Towers are not essential - open a channel with a long time lock and you can be offline for days. Open a channel with someone reputable (like ACINQ) and chances they will try to steal your few bucks are near zero (not ideal, but practical workaround until watchtowers are here).

I dont see any. The only time when you do on chain transacion is when you need to open or close channel.  
Closing can have two forms:  
- cooperative (both parties agree to close, this is regular on chain tx)  
- one party is not cooperating and you force close channel (in this case you have to wait agreed block number - for example 1000 blocks before coins are yours, this can be longer than expected if hashrate goes down on chain)
@_date: 2017-09-12 09:54:19
LN might help here - all off chain LN transactions don't need to be mined - so use next to no electricity. Only opening and closing of the channel needs to be mined.

If you have private keys then you will get coins on all forks. Bitcoin gold is very opaque, and im not sure if fork even happened.

not sure if this is expensive. It shows that you can spend 50k usd to disrupt BTC operations for one day. Its a lot for most users, but for people with bigger pockets, companies, miners, states - its a pocket change.  
  
BTC chain handled the attack very well - but it also highlights that someone willing to spend few milion USD could spam us for months, and to make transactions expensive during that period.   
  
Having bigger blocks would make it more expensive for the attacker - I know, I know, just saying!

Its possble to pay that much if:  
- you have a fat finger and pay 60000 sat/byte instead of 60  
- you consoliate dust, your tx has for example 900 inputs, and instead of waiting for empty mempool you pay going rate

0 conf works very well **in highly centralised system**. If you have only two miners: Jinhan and Roger, and they are both located in the same building, 0 conf is not a problem. This is BitMain Cash aspiration.  
  
If you want however to have a decentralised network - you will have propagation delays, and 0 conf will never be safe.

No its not instant, not in decentralized network. Block time is 10 minutes, there is nothing stopping you to broadcast double spend 2 minutes later (after leaving shop) with much higher tx fee. Most miners will refuse it, but they dont have to (nothing on the consensus level to enforce it). All it takes is for one miners to mine your double spend - this will be a valid block.

Fee based rebalancing is a basic concept. Imagine this channel:  
1: channel is perfectly balanced: Alice asks for 100 satoshi fee in any direction:  
    [someone else] -- [Bob: 10BTC] --- [Alice 10BTC] --- [someone else]  
                                              &lt;-- 100 fee towards Bob      ||         100 fee this direction --&gt;
  
2: over time channel gets unbalanced, Alice increases fee in direction to Bob, but decreases fee in direction from Bob:  
    [someone else] -- [Bob: 15BTC] --- [Alice 5BTC] --- [someone else]  
                                              &lt;-- 200 fee  towards Bob      ||        50 fee this direction --&gt;  
  
This is a simple way to encourage network to rebalance your channel. You ears less fees (until channel is rebalanced), but this is cheaper and simpler than closing unbalanced channel and opening new one (this requires on chain tx). Hope this helps.

Right now there is no standard backup way for ln channels. This will come over time - right now if you switch wallets, close all ln channels, and reopen in new one. That's why this stuff is in beta. 
There is developmemt being done in this field as we speak.

Channel re-balancing is a basic stuff. Channels over time will become unbalanced (where all funds are on one side). There are 2 scenarios there:  
* channel is between LN nodes that route payments: in such case to unbalance a channel fees can be dropped to zero (and even to be negative) for payments in the other direction. This will incentivise network to use this path and re-distribute funds.  
* channel is between SPV wallet (mobile app) and LN node and LN node has all the funds (no way to pay with this channel from app): in such case user might go to Coinbase (or other exchange), purchase btc with fiat and set it directly to LN channel - this will re-balance it  
  
in both scenarios **no on-chain tx is needed**. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:09:47
Ln allows channel rebalancing so capacity might well be near unlimited.  
Micro payments are a problem and will never be achieved on chain - ln is a perfect solution there.  
Do your research, write articles, dont let your bcash biases to cloud it too much :-)
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:50:21
Coinbase will operate in LN. Some people will send funds to Coinbase via LN to sell BTC for fiat - that what allows Coinbase to send funds to you, (of course they can also open and fund a large LN channel with on-chain tx if there is more funds flowing out than in).  
  


Well sorry about that. You claim to research LN for months, write an article, yet I would argue you lack a grasp of basic concepts of LN. Do a proper research before you write a part two - I wish you all the best.

If you read btcpay tutorials - they describe how to set up full note on vps - could be a good starting point

Not sure if we understand each other.  
Eclair 0.3.1 should show a correct on-chain balance. All I'm saying that if you have any problems with eclair, your funds are SAFE. Just import eclair seed into any other wallet app (non-LN) like coinomi or samurai. You will see that your eclair on-chain funds are there (in segwit account) and you will be able to move those. 
  
Of cource coiomi will not show any LN balances.

Dumb ideological? I would never buy anything from Bitmain - even if desperate.  
I recommend for everyone that cares about Bitcoin to use competition and dont feed the company that will spend your money to undermine Bitcoin.

They pulled out previous version as critical bug was found that could lead to inability to close a channel. They managed to fix this - and if you have this issue - visit eclair github page there is a how-to recover your funds. New version seems to work much better.   
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:56:15
Conclusion in the article: "in essence, the LN is a practical solution to some problems that currently don’t exist in the Bitcoin network" .  
  
Rubbish! LN solves real problems that exist today:  
- micro payments (send few satoshi)  
- small payments (maybe a dollar or two)  
- more privacy (not recorded in public blockchain)  
- unlimited capacity (is that not a problem today?)  
- allows to keep base layer decentralised

if it's possible - people will do it for "fun" or "thrill" or to prove zero conf is broken. Zero conf is not safe in decentralised networks. And you can't build a word wide payment system based on something that is not 100% safe. LN solves that for small payments. If you are buying a car or house - waiting for 1 conf is ok.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:32:50
there is no limit - I had one channel open in Eclair for a more than three weeks. On testnet had some lasting for more than two months. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:35:16
Completely normal, could be an mining pool processing withdrawals, etc.

The safest is to use LND, its very stable and everything just works (since 0.41 beta).
Guide how to install is on lnd github page.  
  
  
NOTE: lnd is a daemon and its intended to be keept running 24-7.  
If you need just a spv wallet, then wait, those are still quite buggy.
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:59:58
I used this in the past:

...  


    
while you at that - check the mempool, network is working very well
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:14:23
Nope, channel rebalancing **does not cost any on chain tx** - do your research my friend.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:27:29

no it's not. As network matures there will be much more liquidity put into the channels - right now we have 4000 channels but only around 10BTC in those - this is way, way to little. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:16:03
yes, if you have no open channels then all you need is to import seed after installation
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:29:06
Make sure not to be tricked to buy bcash - bch, instead of bitcoin.

Imagine todays internet with all the infrastructure - that routes packets without issue.  
Suddenly someone adds a super cable to connect the UK with China. This cable has amazing bandwidth capacity.....what does it mean for the existing network? Not much, we can use it, we can ignore it.

if you want great LN experience - running full node and LND is the best right now. Eclair mobile wallet is in comparison way behind. Im sure things will change in next 6 months but right now it's very much alpha/beta stage.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:22:05
just uninstall this shit, there are better apps fir hot wallets. Samurai is great, coinomi is pretty good as well. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:59:40
tip: open a channel to acinq node - a lot of Eclair and BLW users connect to it - so good source of routing traffic. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:03:00
indeed - if you are worried about quantum computers: don't re-use address you spent from (receiving multiple times, if no spent was done is OK)
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:12:47
Play with it yourself in LN emulator:
  
  
This shows both today state and when AMP will be deployed
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:36:53


  
This is already happening on main net - there is NO cost to route payments (no mining involved, etc). So it's not a problem to drop fees to zero if this helps to re-balance channel and allows you to collect routing fees again in the future. As I said LN 101 here.  
  


You purchase with FIAT, Coinbase sends funds already in LN to your LN wallet - ZERO on chain TX. The whole point is that funds "locked" in LN can be transfered between parties multiple times (like see-saw) whoult on-chain tx.  
  
Please don't write articles about something you have no idea about.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:01:06
No, there is no double spend or zero conf risk in LN.  
You fund a multisig address once (open ln channel) and you keep it open for very long time sending and receiving payments. Your funding tx will have many confirmations before you do any ln tx - you cant double spend it.
@_date: 2018-04-13 06:32:28

his vision: gigabyte blocks, only few miners (and only they run full nodes), and everyone uses SPV wallets and have to TRUST miners. How is this in any way close to white-paper? His vision is PayPal v2.
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:08:54
are you on version 0.3.1?, if not delete the app, install 0.3.1 and re-enter your seed.
if you have any LN channels open (does not look like from the picture) - close those first 
  
NOTE: you can enter recovery seed to other apps (like coinomi) and your on-chain funds will be there.
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:54:59
no - want cheap tx? use LN.
leave bcash for Roger to get rekt.
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:47:25
bcash cant compete, nothing can!
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:39:48
For small payments use LN, for large fees are not important. 
Before block size increase there will be improvements like schnorr and taproot. Those should improve capacity.

@_date: 2018-12-22 15:45:23
you can use TOR as well
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:42:54
not necessarily- soon you will be able to open ln channel paying with liquid token for example reducing need to hit L1
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:52:32
All mobile wallets use non public channels (for example eclakr of BLW).
None of those channels are advertised so not visible in LN stats.
Ln is much bigger than what 1ml.com can see and it works great.
High L1 fees will force businesses to accept LN speeding up adoption.
