"Sound investment vehicle" up and down 5% every 3 hours for the past 7 days ��

I think was due to a .1 btc transaction to a silk road operated account. 
Not sure if there was maybe a more compelling link than that (likely and I've just read it wrongly)

Welcome to r/Bitcoin

So don't join a cloud mining scheme then? 
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:57:07
What does this have to do with Bitcoin? If they used Bitcoin they wouldn't have been caught so easily? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:54:59
Maybe I'm wrong mine just went through, unconfirmed transactions are about 35% of what they were a few hours ago you might get through! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:26:21
Lol the fee is crazy crazy small, been waiting 24 hours with a fee 40x larger! Make the fee larger when it eventually gets returned 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:41:13
Yeah I'll just use paypal gift for 0 fees or even venmo. 
Maybe I would just use actual cash all of these options get there instantly unlike Bitcoin.

Do they not still mine but with no block reward? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:12:07
Sorry just caught up with my buddy it's 0.15% +20p on all transactions so can work out a lot more expensive for smaller transactions. 
That was our concern with the 0 confirmations, I've had a transaction never confirm and was eventually refunded because the fee was set to nearly 0 during one of the price rises around the 2k mark. 
The Lightning network sounds interesting, I'm researching it as we speak. Seems like Bitcoin has some kinks to work out before a it's fully integrated into our daily lives, hopefully one day!

Preach brother.

Are bitcoins not software? I'm sure this safe will keep them super safe
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:50:57
"A few minutes".... lol
0.01 transaction fees .........

He was taking the piss.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:59:56
So you like a millionaire or some shit now?
@_date: 2019-04-12 11:40:17
But bitcoins can process transactions though right?
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:22:34
And when you make a mistake and send PayPal to a bitcoin cash address you can contact help and get them to sort it.
@_date: 2019-01-20 11:40:13
Sounds like Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:35:11
Quality shitpost
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:26:13
Any proof of this or is it just made up? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:38:44
Hopefully something to make Bitcoin feasible for use as a currency rather than a "store of wealth".

It was reactions to that woman who got smacked in the face with a watermelon from a giant catapult
