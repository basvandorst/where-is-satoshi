Coinbase charges 2.5 percent. Coinbase pro is not as intuitive and requires a weekish to deposit your money. ATMs are instant. This is not a fair comparison.

so it seems, that 20k is the most talked about number on this subreddit now, so i assume after 20k, anything is fair game from 30-100k. thanks for your post it was very informative.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:26:31
so then the magic number is 20k
