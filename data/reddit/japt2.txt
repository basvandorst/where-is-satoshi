"Vast majority"... you kidding me.. few people with a lot of money won't make as much as 7 billion people making small amounts of money.

Yeah, I considered that. It’s definitely a viable argument for why it has value, but I don’t understand how it would have value compared to an identical coin. If a group of people used bitcoin software for a new coin with the same limited supply and the same mining electricity requirements(same POW), wouldn’t it fulfill the same purpose as a “digital gold”?

"I've mentioned Bcash, so there really aren't any bans"
"Well that ban was understandable because it was about Bcash, not Bitcoin."

I agree that is just BCH shilling, but I'd argue that's a result of blatant bch censorship on What happens when people who want to discuss bch's validity go to They get banned. Not downvoted. Banned. So where can you go? was the natural spot for those who were optimistic about Bcash to go, and thus it became a Bcash sub because this was the Bitcoin sub, who were "enemies" against Bcash.

I definitely could not. But what if a couple of billionaires decided they wanted to make another one and got their billionaire friends in on it, and market it to everyone else? I’m not arguing that it’s easy to make another Bitcoin, but the fact remains it can still be done. The same can’t be said for Gold. I’m not even saying bitcoin doesn’t have value, I’m just not sure if it can be considered similar to gold just because of a limited supply.

It’s so sad to hear that. Blockchain is the invention, not bitcoin. I think we should be happy there are so many different projects popping up.

Like 1-2$ maybe. I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with that. It’s literally people giving away tiny amounts of Bitcoin cash. You used to be able to do it with bitcoin.

I agree, but my point is that any invention regarding blockchain should be considered. Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum aren't even direct competitors, but it seems like there's alot of alt coin = trash sentiment in this sub when in reality it's just the industry growing, which I think is a good thing.

Problem is both and hate each other so much the average person who isn’t that invested doesn’t know who is right. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:26:11
That’s ridiculous. There should/will be many, many block chains for different reasons. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:31:03
Who gets to decide what is bitcoin and what isn't? Exchanges who do what they think the market wants. That is what bitcoin is about: following the majority. Right now, the current BTC is the most favored, so it is bitcoin.

I agree. Problem comes with the fact there is no regulation on crypto markets atm, so big whales are actually able to manipulate the price. Whether or not it is happening is up to debate though. They’re investing because these people who may or may not be manipulating the market are still trying to make money, just like us, and their alleged pumps/dumps result in us making/losing a lot of money. Everyone who trades crypto is accustomed to a very high amount of risk. Additionally, all of us believe in the long term value of the blockchain. I firmly believe in the next 3 years we will see regulation of the market and prices will skyrocket as cryptos become legitimized. Just not sure which cryptos.

I’m confused. Doesn’t theymos also advocate for his site here? How is it any different?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:29:28
agree to disagree I guess. It's one thing to innovate blockchain technology, and another to use it as it is and try to find your own solutions to problems that nobody has solved yet(scaling). To say that one method is better than another is foolish. We should encourage all coins to do their best and find their own solutions and let the tech speak for itself and let the market decide.

I am too. I’m just trying to understand Bitcoin’s role in this space other than the fact that it was the first. Just that fact may make it successful, but I was hoping there was a better explanation for its role as a digital gold. Thank you for your response.

Agreed, but you all do the same thing in "Finally decided to invest!! To the moon!!" is one of the most frequently upvoted posts. Yes, shills bcash, but shills bitcoin. They're both the same. You have to look through all the shit on both sides to get to thoughtful discussions.
