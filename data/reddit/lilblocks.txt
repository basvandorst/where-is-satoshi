Bitcoin is backed by my HODLing skills

You can if you'd like, but using BTC for it is suboptimal to HODL

HODL FOR LIFE!!!!

Copay or Blochain.info are pretty good IMO.  Not sure how people feel about Jaxx
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:01:59
lol why would they even try to scale on chain??? Let the idiots try, while we stick to the facts and implement new cutting edge tech like lightening and schnorr.

Why would I waste $15 of my precious BTC in tx fees to buy your herbs?? HODL is so weak bros. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:12:45
if you're not going to hodl, you should at least wait until lightning is live to avoid paying the high fees to Bitmain. You're getting played dude!
