So now it stabilzes.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:16:47
I made enough mistakes to hopefully start making some solid assumptions.  Its just my thoughts and i welcome as many swear words and abuse as anyone can toss my way.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:08:16
I cant shut up, but i like your comment
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:32:58
Thats great prediction
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:27:59
We will see. If it doesnt go any lower then i will call it a victory.  If it goes below 11.5 then im way off
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:09:37
Its not over but i have made enough mistakes already.  Its got to crash for a bit.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:12:15
Be good bitcoin, i know everyone is stronger and less emotional than me, but i really want to be able to make sense out of it all.  If the price stabilizes here then were in for a smooth ride back up to 13 then 15 muy rapido
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:10:05
True true true, if it stays around where i suggested then it would not be a dip on the monthly chart.  If it goes down further then it would be a dip,  good call.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:31:20
Wait its been a lot more than a year.  I started using bitcoin to pay indepent contractors over seas.  Then fell in love with crypto and started to invest a lot of my time and money.  Im just saying and doing what i feel, your welcome for speaking truth without bias.  If your lost then im not trying to save you

@_date: 2019-07-10 21:51:18
Its been my hobby.   I dont even day trade i just am obsessed.  I agree 100% with you, but for me its all about taming the beast.  As the market grows there should be some more consistency.   If regular joes like myself start making correct assumptions.  That is a good thing for the market
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:03:28
I had high hopes. Just postpone those plans for a bit.
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:21:37
You need passphrase and that means using it every time u access your holdings.  Each passphrase you make is a new address so you cant just put a passphrase on you current address.  Make a passphrase then send all your holdings to new address imediately.  Correct me if im explaining this wrong.

@_date: 2019-11-10 19:04:31
Lol , why would u ever think or say that
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:29:56
They cant take your bitcoin, but if u dont give it up they take you.   Jail or Prison
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:52:41
Hi somehow in the last nine months someone got your seed.   How did you store it?  Where? All together or split up half words in one place half in other?  I have never even spoke my seed outloud and its spamped into steel split up in two seperate locations.  
You dont need new trezor, follow youtube video on how to wipe clean and then try again.  Coinbase should be much lower fee if you link bank account.  Getting to be a good time to buy :)
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:11:16
This is an international contractor, he wanted money right away and did not want to wait 3 days for wire and pay $45 for wire fee.  Also, i was at the coffee shop and sent him bitcoin on the spot, if i wanted to initiate a wire transfer... it still would not be started with my archaic bank and then the questions from my bank on why i want to send, to who, to where, for what....   i have been paying i dependent contractors overseas for years now with bitcoin and its only going to increase
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:40:12
You cant buy very much with the trezor buy and its high fees becuase only accepts credit cards.  Trezor put it there to increase their offerings and grow.  Im guessing that the person who wrote this post actually bought a little bit of bitcoin like $20 worth through the trezor buy option.
To help you out, your saying you own a trezor hardware wallet?  And thats what you used to buy?
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:12:49
Cant wait to change that name to “now retired”

I have never even spoke my seed outloud and its spamped into steel split up in two seperate locations.  And of course everythinf would still be in your account if you would have set up the passphrase!  Do that please next time.

@_date: 2019-11-25 17:54:42
Gotcha, only a few things could have happened.  One: when you set up your trezor you took photos of the seed words or put the seed words somewhere in the cloud or digital.  Two: you told someone that you bought a trezor and that person you told has access to your device.  Three:  you bought a used trezor and didnt wipe it properly.   Your crypto is gone and if this is a true story consider yourself very lucky that its only $200.  Trezor is my personal favorite hardware wallet and 100% secure.  Remeber, now you are in charge of your private keys, there is no third party that is going to protect you or f you over, you are your own bank and if u need help protecting yourself i can answer any questions you have.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:22:53
Wait for a clear sign.  You will know when the time is right, even if you pay a little more for the bitcoin at least you will not be buying before a huge drop.  Most likely going to be in a bear market for the rest of this month possibly into 2020.
@_date: 2019-11-27 22:47:54
Lol we are in different parts of the world. ��
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:30:33
You would have to wash it with a privacy coin
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:00:13
Were still above 8,250 thats all that matters in terms of supports.  Im not afraid to go lower, the last couple months have changed my outlook, its just too hard to drive the price down and there is too much infostructure being built into the space.  Its a no brainer to own bitcoin and if your waiting for the lowest price possible then just buy in half your position now at the least so you dont get left behind
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:34:03
I’m not buying this dip yet.
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:13:50
Im predicting big fall.  It has nnot fell enough.  But i understand your strategy
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:36:41
I hope so.   Im playing bear.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:59:29
It happened
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:23:32
Well i jus figure there is a better way.  Im to emotional to trade myself and im not patient enough to hold.  Is there a goos firm or company that can trade for me?  If bots are not the way to go, or os someone going to defend a bot?
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:47:21
Its me im not going to lie, it crushed me in 2018 but this year even when i make stupid (emotional) mistakes i keep making money.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:44:04
I wanted to give a strategy but the truth is every day (or even every hour) its an entirely new ball game.  Im 100% out of the market today, who knows what happens next.
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:42:45
What part of MX?
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:29:11
Only big enough to decide the trend for the next month.  However big that is, after today it should look more clear.  One thing is for sure it cant stay right at $10,000 forever. I personally sold all mine at $9,950 a few days ago so i would like to see it go down.  But in bull markets it usually goes up at the end of the triangle.  I admit im just too weak emotionally and sell and buy too often but its saved my ass over the years.  And i dont split anything up like lets keep 25% in.   For me its 100% of my savings in or out or in or out.  Aways move 100% is my strategy.  Not that im an expert, it just makes sense to me especially since i am done with altcoins for a while now.  They really screwed me.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:22:20
This makes no sense.  If they are holders then they are not selling.   This is FUD
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:34:16
Your TA is correct, but TA is not always accurate, if it was then we would all be rich already.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:40:06
Tempting but im waiting for a lower dip
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:19:03
Ask a friend with bitcoin to sell you some.
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:28:47
I keep reading “better price discovery”.  I think were all going to be going off the Bakkt price if they assert their dominance.  Kind of scary.
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:16:21
Its the twitter account supporting bitcoin instead of altcoins for the first time in a while.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:41:52
Wait who is freaking out, im waiting for a lower dip.  I pulled out everything a week ago at 9950.  Im waiting to put everything back in.  I was keen enough to already have increased my position so now I am in the driver seat.
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:16:56
U in or out?
I am out since a few days ago.  Not that im proud of it, just using stable coins as a sort of insurance in case it dumps.   I dont mind missing out on a bit of upside, if i see the trend rising then im back in.
@_date: 2019-08-22 14:16:47
What about square?   I have never tries it but Jack says its there and ready to be used.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:14:32
[its tight](
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:11:25
It better be or im taking back the award
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:23:31
Want to be a holder but i get too emotional.  Ive been strong through this 2k correction so now i cant sell becuase if i do then it will skyrocket.  Ive learned to just do the opposite of what my emotions tell me.  Really im looking for a good bot or company to trade for me.  If there was a legit way then i would send all my crypto there.   Its only a few hundres dollars worth but over time im looking to increase my stakes just taking it slow.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:44:14
I care.  Dont like the bitcoin markets sub.  Just post everything here
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:38:37
Its not hard to buy back in if i feel its going up.   But i see some big dips incoming today.   Think about it, the big time investors are going to want the prices to be low when bakkt starts.  The lower the better, then more institutional buyers will feel comfortable entering
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:24:35
Its going to happen now because of the amount of times its hitting the 10k psych level and to amplify the situation were 2/3 way through symetrical triangle.  Break outs dont happen at the end of triangles they happen 2/3 way through in most cases.  Im bear right now only because it looks like it is pounding downward on the 10k price.  Advisory: im extremely weak emotionally with bitcoin price (buy and sell way too much) but im addicted to it is so I feel my opinion might carry some value.
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:23:18
I was on sell, all i had to do was hit buy.  One person here helped.  The rest of you just said mean things but thats cool im sure im a lot better off than the mean people.  Happy people are successful and have no time for negativity.  I have been holding bitcoin for some time now but i purchased some Link.  Wanted to trade it for bitcoin and i was on sell instead of buy.  Simple error with simple fix.  Thank you to some, actually thank you also to the negative comments they make me smile
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:08:14
When i knew nothing i went to bitcoin.com and put in $100.  Never saw that $100 again.  Thought the entire thing was too difficult and almost gave up.  Now im trying to gain more BTC but doing so somewhat responsibly.  Want to put all my savings in but cant pull that trigger. Constant battle in my head and in the world of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:40:17
I was using a 7k swing, i was not correctly analyzing but 1k vs 1m might be a little skewed.  Let me say 50/50 percent either 1k or ATH Within 6 months.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:39:28
Yeah.  This is my first reddit comment.   I feel they will all be this positive.  I just stop watching bitcoin when it falls.  And pick up my phone when its rising
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:30:06
That happened yesterday almost 24 hours ago

@_date: 2019-09-08 02:28:12
Great idea
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:54:51
I tell myself thats what im going to do, maybe if i could stop watching the price i would be able to stick to my guns.  Its not going to happen, i just want to hear others mistakes to myself feel better about my own
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:12:14
I was not expecting such great comments.  You all have helped me to make a huge decision to just forget about my investment and come back and check at a later date.  It will be very hard and im sure i will make mistakes.  But if i do trade, i will only trade 20%.   I really just wanted to vent but instead i found a lot of support and ideas that are possibly life changing for me.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:12:15
Good luck
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:41:07
I watched some of the youtube videos about 4 year cycles.  I managed to not wake up and look at the botcoin price.  Made it a few hours without looking.  Think im on the road to a better place.  Still am all in, going to try my best to not trade.  Might even take my investment off the exchnages.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:48:45
I am somewhat afraid you might be correct.  I will definately be cautious about this.
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:50:04
Its the first im im going to say it.  Sounds so cliche, BUY THE DIPS
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:32:45
U all seriously getting upset over this?  I think its a great idea and the dude is practicing what everyone preaches.  Leave him be
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:29:21
Learn not to care about price and better your life will be ��
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:12:55
My first $100 was on bitcoin.com.  Never saw a dime of the money it just disappeared.
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:44:51
I found some recent strength to stop trading and just hold.  Living life a little more but still technically obssesed.
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:51:20
True, i think i am incapable of buying and holding.
