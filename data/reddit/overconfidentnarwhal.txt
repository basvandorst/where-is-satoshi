Would you mind showing us the transaction details.

Don't tell me what to do!

I have never even gotten a micropayment

In many countries (Including the U.S.) unregulated online gambling IS illegal.

What happens if everyone signs up for 100 accounts though?
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:51:50
Just make sure the backup is encrypted with a strong different password. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:15:00
Ha, thank you. Lol a barrack Obama. It dosent surprise me that that's worth a penny 
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:48:56
I was more worried about bots
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:16:35
You never replied to my PM, horrible customer service!
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:57:13
already exists

What don't you like about online wallets, do you have plans to try our service. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:55:05
Seems to be all good now!
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:59:10
With our wallet you can request the private keys and they will be 100% in your control
Encrypted on server side
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:11:19
I'm sorry about the unordered pictures. I uploaded them from mobile and there seems to be a issue. I will fix that first thing tomorrow if you want to check back. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:45:41
Private keys can be requested to be encrypted and sent to you on demand. After they are encrypted we have no way to decrypt them without you logging in with your password. 
You then have full control over the private keys. 
Plus were open source!
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:30:54
Heh, to send bitcoins to an address you enter the address. Pretty simple but thank you 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:32:40
What do you not like about online wallets, do you think that you will try our service?
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:41:10
You can always transfer them right out of your coinbase account into your own offline wallet. I trust coinbase for the 1hour they have my coins, after I transfer them it's IMPOSSIBLE for them to do anything about it. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:36:19
Do you plan on using our service?
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:28:06
Hopefully! You can also setup individual accounts and request the private keys too!
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:39:11
I will be adding an author info page about exactly who I am in a few days, all code is open source and I have worked on many large Bitcoin/doge related projects before.
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:35:48
Shhhhh. Coming Soon!
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:35:06
Do you have any plans to use are service? $0.10
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:00:04
What don't you like about online wallets, do you have any plans to use ours?
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:24:31
Can Confirm
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:54:49
I recently developed a wallet called Fit Wallet. Check my recent posts for the giveaway. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:01:01
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:05:25
They should group transactions and send them like every 30 mins. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:48:15
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:41:15
Do you have any plans to test ours? $0.10
@_date: 2015-01-27 11:39:59
Maybe I'll make that a little better. Submit a bug report at  and our devs should fix it within a day. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:34:28
Thank you, do you have a github account? If you file an issue under feature request for this our devs should add it within a few days. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:52:35
We are looking for more developers but we're currently low on funds. Servers are expensive! Shoot me a resume and/or portfolio with your price. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:36:13
I would recommend contacting coinbase support, they are super good with this. Also I'm giving away free bitcoin right now on here and they were nice enough to give me a discount for it. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 21:53:15
Can you please explain to me how a cipher works, without giving to much away obviously. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:48:00
Thanks for taking a look, we are ran off donations from the crypto currency community and we have plans to do a redesign of our site soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:20:06
Yes but that defeats the purpose. The purpose is to get new users educated about digital currencies. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:19:16
But seriously, it's random. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 22:25:29
Ofcourse it can already receive tips, I'll get a reddit wiki page for it once it is fully ready. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:56:11
Yes, I agree that online wallets should NEVER be used for long term storage or large amounts. Do you have any plans to checkout our wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-27 01:46:20
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:17:49
[mega.nz]( is a good option and provides 50 free GB but also take a look at [fitbobcat.com]( It is $50/TB/Year which is significantly cheaper. If you have less than 50GB Mega.nz is the best option but anything more I believe Fitbobcat be fine.

Git is not decentralized at all. The files all reside on one or more servers operated by the same public identity.  GitHub for example. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:10:34
No, the saying is (it's like) "a hot knife through butter"

The "game" would have to be hosted on a different server. What the 21co provides is known as an RPC server. The two servers would then communicate with each other. 
I believe that bullet point is a little misleading because 21co is not powerful enough to run an entire game server. However, it is a tiny powerful RPC server.

Feel free to checkout the [Getting Started Guide](
If you want to buy with your bank account, I recommend coinbase.com

@_date: 2015-03-27 05:02:28
Yes, this is correct.
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:19:31
Congrats to you!
