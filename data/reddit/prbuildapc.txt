If they're within EU there might be a chance. But I don't know a lot of EU laws though.  
If that's from China or other remote country you might just only gain knowledge of what not to do in the future, and carry on.  
I would still go to the police and file a report on them.

What website did you use?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:55:03
lmao, people keep surprising me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:54:29
Yes, so I can buy your btc with a discount.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:44:57
Nothing. He is just a mother FUDder..
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:16:46
I don't understand the necessity of people creating FUD. I honestly don't. Even if you don't care about crypto, just read the fucking articles that you post and make sure you're not spreading shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:14:14
use your phone... that's no excuse!!!
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:26:06
It's better this than fudders.

I would either pre-order and wait for the ledger from the manufacturer's website ONLY, or just buy a trezor.  
Just search here for ledger scams, specially on ebay and you'll be surprised at the level of sophistication that people can go to scam you.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:34:59
That's your problem. Never buy from anywhere other than the official manufacturer website. You can file a police report, I don't know where you live but it might be a good idea to get that going.

Can’t you open an account for them, transfer btc or whatever coin and make them withdraw to their bank account?
@_date: 2019-10-14 07:16:58
On the bright side, it’s cake day!
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:01:45
Do ISP's still have limits? DAMN IT MARTY! What year is this?
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:58:41
I thought we cleared the bitcoin trash sv abc skunks but I guess they are still roaming around...
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:39:04
I’d say over 9000...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:18:58
That's what people said when it was worth $200... and then when it was $1000, and then when it was $2000.... and then when.......

@_date: 2019-01-19 08:42:54
I thought it was against the rules to share stuff about scam coins...

I think he was a time traveler
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:35:42
If you want to trade crypto for fiat to use daily, he is still going to need banks, even indirectly. :(
@_date: 2019-01-20 14:46:14
Who cares, Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:37:08
How else would you ensure security by having 1 or 100 people holding all the security of the network? Ask banks/companies how easy it is, not a single bank/company has a zero hack track record. Why is that? Go learn more about decentralisation and you'll figure it out, I hope.

He’s talking about the bubble that he has on his finger, he’s a keyboard warrior and developed a big bubble that he’s saying it’s about to pop. Gross.

I just noticed that we are almost hitting 200Gb blockchain size. Will this be a deterrent for new people to start running full nodes? Is there anything being done to mitigate this future problem?
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:34:45
Sure buddy :)
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:08:39
Whats a paid wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:42:22
And yet, 10 years since inception it's still the only unhacked network holding billions.
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:21:35
The lack of 0$ prediction bothers me... where are the haters man?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:27:29
Google corruption and hacking and you'll understand why having millions of decentralised entities confirming all transactions is the way to go.

“I don’t like Bitmain, I hope they feel the same pain (...)”  
There, I fixed your sentence.
