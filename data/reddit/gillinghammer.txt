The major assumption this article makes without support is that Tethers have not maintained their dollar value. 
I believe this is wrong because it does not acknowledge the growing number investors in Bitcoin.
With over 1m new investors / month - I believe it justifies the newly printed tethers just to meet this demand.

You could issue your own coins in an ICO

Bunch of limit orders sitting just about 11,200 all the way up to 11,400... would be my guess

Buy on hype, sell on news

Yeah I need to brush up on how futures contracts work. Ive traded call and put options before and from what it sounds like it's structured in a similar way. 
I was hoping I could buy Bitcoin Puts that cover the same $ amount of Bitcoin I own as the hedge. So if Bitcoin depreciates I would make money that I could use to buy more Bitcoin at a lower price.

Halts for a few minutes but should resume shortly.

pete najarian, a CNBC regular, was just on and is very bullish the whole crypto scene.

I feel like we are going to shake out the people worried about a crash... then boom up to 15k+

Tldr; Yes
Look at the first day of each month for the last year, and ask this same question...

They definitely seem to be negatively biased. Lots of talk about how much shorting is about to happen when futures go live. They do interview a fair number of Bitcoin / blockchain businesses who help spread the optimism.

Blockfolio seems to be the defacto standard but recently I've been trying the mobile web application mercuryapp.io which synchs w your exchange account. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:38
Maybe viable solution once LN is implemented

Thanks for this. Looks like I need to investigate the Bitmex platform more closely

Has someone invented a bitcoin alarm clock yet... alarm is set by +-10% move in BTC

Bitcoin swings over $1000 each day. Plenty of opportunities to jump in the elevator!

Buy 1/3 now, 1/3 next week and 1/3 after the 18th if you want
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:59:25
Haha right... Want to provide some proof with your wallet address holding this amount?

Bisq.io (decentralized exchange w escrow)

Website says they are buying BTC at $14000, yikes...

Plus the number of Satoshi digits can always be increased. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:51:52
Means this exchange is ill prepared for Bitcoin price action. 
Usually a change in +-5% triggers a halt in trading to avoid massive sell offs or squeeze

Automated Lending Bot
If youre technical enough to deploy a little code you should give this a try.

Couldn't you get around this buy holding half your coins and $ on one exchange and half on another. Then just buy BTC on exchange 1 and sell immediately on exchange 2. Rebalance your account at your own pace... Or am I missing 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:04:42
Highly possible... running straight to 15k by Friday, equally possible though at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:56:19
Which half?

Download the Stylish Chrome plugin and then install my style

Also interested in hearing some first hand accounts using this service. Just been getting up to speed. Looks sweet but the amount limits are slightly restrictive at the moment.

James Altucher is claiming October 26 during the Amazon earnings call they will announce this very thing. Imagine the implications too now that whole foods is part of the bezos empire.
