Awesome book, read it on my Kindle a while ago. His other book was a bit tough read, regardless, thank God we have Andreas.

Hahah. I agree! :)

Don't have huge account myself. Where I live, people get quite excited about 50$, though I am not donating 50$ to them, we'll do a trial for 1-3$ and then I will sell some of my BTC to them.

I've already done that, they want to experiment, hence the 50$-100$ investments.

That's what I've been trying to tell them the whole time. Listen to me for once, and you'll be astonished once I tell you everything :)

I watched Banking on Bitcoin twice. I think it gives a sense to a viewer that Bitcoin needs regulation. Regardless, good idea, I think it can get their attention enough. Thank you!

I know, but I want to educate them, not make them rich.

Wow, superb design. I'm in!

Good points, thank you!

Their motivation is : They want me to stfu about Bitcoin for once, so they agreed to listen to me :)

They don't speak English quite well I'm afraid, so they have limited access to real BTC literature. Basically, I'm their only hope, they are screwed :D

I watched this video a while ago, thanks for reminding me about it. Unfortunately it has no subtitles in our language, as I mentioned my friends are not fluent in English, so I don't think they'll understand it.

Lol, epic!

This is great, I'll do it that way. Really good, cheers mate!

Me too! Been going through Wiki FAQ, just to remind myself of the questions I had as a newbie.
