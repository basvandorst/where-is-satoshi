what are perspectives of dealing with anonymity with bitcoin in longer run? If bitcoin is going to be succesfull it has potential to replace real money and go mainstream, right? So at one point there will have to be taxes and some mechanism that prevent moving large sums of money without control. Is it possible with bitcoin to control it in some wat?

Understand that bitcoin is very dangerous thing to invest. Invest in stocks, look how much companies like amazon, apple , oracle, netflix, airbnb, microsoft, facebook and google have grown this year. Bitcoin is good but you have to decide how many % of your wealth are you willing to put into risky investment and stick to it

Thanks for answer. Do you imagine bitcoin replacing money in future? How would taxes work in that situation?

I understand many benefits of bitcoin and I really like them. What seems contradictory to what people have said about bitcoin possibly replacing things like western union, because it is simply cheaper. My question is about this aspect of bitcoin - is sending money cheaper than western union, visa etc. ? Can it be in the future?

Finally some normal answer. If there is one thing I don't like about reddit, it is getting downvoted to oblivion when asking a certain subreddit about some (seemingly) negative aspect of what this subreddit is about.  
Maybe you could help me with this: 
- From what I understood, one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin was it's possibility to replace things like western union, because transactions are simply cheaper. Is that true? Can it ever be true?
