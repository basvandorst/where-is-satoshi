I'm more or less set for this year, but for the next growing season I'd love to spend BTC on seeds.

So I guess they did want to do that, but because they are wards of federal government, they are prohibited from using bitcoin. Sounds like a really strange legal loophole, but that's what I gathered when I was researching Mazacoin a few days ago.

Applause to you, my Зямляк! Thanks for reminding why a 100 USD bill is always going to be worth less than $100 BTC equivalent to me.

Awesome news. Thanks, Gyft!

Nice! Where is this?

I think their reputation took a hit after the Neo &amp; Bee fiasco earlier this year.
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:33:04
I LOLed. 
"Виртуальная валюта" means "virtual currency", btw.  
Anyway, seems like there's a lot of positive reception of bitcoin in the slavic media, I expect a wave of adoption.

Decentralized digital networks and mycelial webs [have a lot in common](

Sorry, but you could [get actual shit]( with crypto and metals for a while now.    
They got a bigger selection too!

Take a look at [Cryptography I]( I have similar goals, and that's one of the more interesting things I've found so far.

Great merch! I love the fungi-inspired designs. Will be buying some of these soon.

Fellow Snohomie here, just sent some BTC love :)
Interested in learning more about managing relief efforts and charities through crypto, so I'm saving this thread and will be keeping an eye on further developments. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:42:27
Thank you for putting this together. Way fun!
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:46:23
Way too much potential for abuse through multiple accounts, etc.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:48:07
Sorry to hear about your loss.  
But why did you keep 30 BTC on coinbase? I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:36:40
Yes...almost like it might be a ponzi scheme.

I'm about to get the new [Humble Bundle]( Outer Space bundle, which will get my number of steam games to a nice round 99 (most of those are from previous humble bundles bought with btc). I'm paying with bitcoin, and I have been since I got into crypto. Paypal can take days to confirm payments, and ccs take ages to enter info. There's no way I'm going back to legacy payment systems for humble bundle. 
Pretty sure you could buy Minecraft with bitcoin for a very long time too.
I don't think it's a matter of whether Bitcoin could be a viable payment method for games, but of how much business they are actively losing to competition that's already accepting btc.

Pledged some millibits. Feels good, man.  
I kind of glossed over this when the campaign was posted the first time around, but it didn't really grab me because of all the other circus going on at the time. These are the kind of projects I personally would like to see thrive under Bitcoin.  
I've also been randomly browsing Indiegogo and Kickstarter all day today, so something just clicked up in that noggin when I read "Pozible is like kickstarter, but they take bitcoin."

Ok, buddy, you're in charge of that now.

I think most of the people who liked that page and would actually see your comment won't get the sarcasm.    
Like, they'll actually think you are saying that you had a worse experience with bitcoin and will pat themselves on the back for using wu. 
What about something like "Я обожаю как ваши высокие тарифы переводят мои деньги на конкурсы."    
That's a bit more more obvious, but you gotta troll harder to get through to the thicker-headed ones. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:02:08
Good, BTC-friendly story and interesting interviews. As a bilingual who has been learning about crypto from english sources, I found this very informative.
