Bullish trap to short BTC for Chinese
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:37:32
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:12:48
Looks like it is a bullish trap
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:58:23
If its permanent, Chinese people are going to sell everything in the exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:48:18
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:58:57
I dont think so. Still most of the miners are from there. This seems to bullish trap so that the Chinese people can actually short the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:31:41
But what would be the reason?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:52:59
He just dipped the price in this small time
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:41:01
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:13:25
He hinted that - the ban on Chinese exchanges could be permanent.
So this whole thing sums up to be a bullish trap for Chinese to short the BTC.

But checking the market volume always helps. I'm smelling a extension of this dip. This just happened coz of some tweets and JP Morgan. China is yet to release official statement regarding CNYT.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:00:20
His news u noob
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:18:06
Its tanking lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:49:27
Went to 3200
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:03:34
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:47:59
I meant, if China releases news officially there shud be one more?
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:59:31
But my question was will there be a further dip or the dip is over?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:49:27
Went to 3200
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:55:12
Check the growth. M trying to help
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:47:57
Why like yest? Is there dip today?
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:25:18
The dip aint over yet. This is the bullish trap. Be careful.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:27:15
C'mon the communist govt bans it and most of the citizens rather than storing wud just sell it for what they get. What is ur explanation, for the dips mate?
