This doesn't make any sense whatsoever. How do you know that now is not "right before a $70 million hack?" Can you see the future? Bitfinex doesn't even know how they were compromised, so all they can do is make guesses about whether they are closing the vulnerability or not. Meanwhile the bitfinex hacker is on twitter saying that he's about to perform another hack. No, there is no "safer" time to store coins on an exchange. All times are equally un-safe.

Yes, like I said, I know that it's possible to prove reserves. This fact doesn't prevent any of the exchanges from not doing it. The number of exchanges that have this capability or make that information available to depositors is near 0. The fact that this exists is not protecting you.

Other good ones include "Blowstamps" (some dude's grandma) and "Bizzlebits" (my father in law).

Good point rydan. There may be nothing, from the perspective of Amazon that separates you from the criminal in this transaction, although I'll admit that I don't know much about how they would handle the circumstances where a gift was paid for with a stolen card. Do they really go after the recipient? If so, who is protecting regular folk from receiving unsolicited gifts?
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:38:18
Love this guy, and this community really needs spokesmen that are not 30 something white dudes. Support the fuck out of anyone else speaking for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:44:12
Sorry if I'm being ignorant here, but why is this a reason not to use it? A great service that bridges the gap between bitcoin and Amazon? I certainly would recommend against buying gift cards here, for sure, because that requires you trust that the stranger on the other end of the deal is honest, but for other goods, I see no reason to avoid the service.
The only semi-logical reason I could think of is that you are potentially "helping bad guys" by using it, which seems silly, in my opinion. If we stopped doing anything that was being abused by people with bad intentions, we would all be standing in cells looking at each other in silence. Credit cards are helping bad guys, and if they are not using them here, they are using them somewhere else. If we're gonna be the credit card police, then the world really has no reason to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:27:02
Yeah, there is no reason to assume that all the goods are stolen. That's silly. I was excited about this service from both sides of the equation, so your assumption that there is only thieves is flawed.
If there is theft happening here, then I don't see how bitcoin is making it any easier to get away with through purse.io. Perhaps you can elaborate more on that?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:40:48
Yeah, and it's also a little mystifying that it appears to have worked. Too many people cheer-leading this news. WTF.
@_date: 2014-08-29 22:15:12
The comments under the article are painful to read.
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:43:37
This guy is awesome. Need more dudes like this.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:42:36
First of all, rydan pointed to a valid reason, while you offered nothing here. Using the service to buy goods with bitcoin is not stealing. Using the service to buy bitcoin with stolen credit cards is stealing, which I'm not recommending anyone do.
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:28:01
Did they say that there were less bitcoin sales than last year somewhere? I haven't been paying attention, but this "recap" avoids that information entirely. Just asking, since your comment indicates the results were not as good.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:07:50
For many users that are less tech savvy, interfacing with bitcoin through those websites and 2FA is going to be more secure than trying to teach them how to do it on their own.
Sucks, but that's the reality. By all means make people aware of the risks and alternatives, but there is no one size fits all solution to be prescribed, and generally getting too deep into the the security topic early is going to scare these people away.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:27:34
Are there any other job openings where you're at?
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:32:51
Don't have any, so I can't confirm this.
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:26:06
I agree, but I'm not the one doing the bad thing in this example.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:00:40
Appreciated, and also a little sad that being reasonable is tip-worthy around here, haha.
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:01:36
This is a silly article, but I guess it was written 4 months ago... Still, the longer it exists, the more embarrassing it's going to be.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:33:59
He's right. Let's pack it up folks.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:32:42
Perhaps, but this is exactly the sort of thing you'd want to say to get these regulations imposed. Don't put too much value in the things he says, pay attention to the things he does.
We've got a long history of political figures misrepresenting themselves and their agendas in order to get them through. It's tactic number one in their bag of tricks; pretend you're working for the people who might oppose what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:33:54
I would just point out that there is at least one group already working on this and it's in the late stages of development right now. 
Bitcoin is on their radar as one of the use cases for this device.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:52:58
And if they don't use a payment processor to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:02:45
If they mined 100% of the coins and dumped them immediately to market, it would take only $36 per day worth of buying to maintain a $0.01 price. You could double the price of bitcoin for $36 per day in the scenario you've outlined here.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:27:46
To be fair, they don't specify who is saving money.
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:49:30
0.005 BTC/day * 90 days = 0.45 BTC Assuming difficulty stays the same that entire time (best case for you)
At current BTC price, that's roughly $95.
Therefore, if the AM BE300S miner costs less than $405 (S4 at $500 - $95) It's already better. But if it's also more efficient?
The difference is not only "close enough to offset lost mining income" but far surpasses it, if FC's indications that these may be sub $300 machines is any indicator.
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:18:43
Haha, why downvote this? He's right, and the fact that there are people downvoting comments to that effect make it even more similar. Boy was it frustrating warning people about Gox months ahead of time and then having my own friends lose money on Gox, everyone acting surprised.

You do realize that 0.30 is less than 0.40, right?
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:22:53
I saw it on day one and posted in the thread, but page 11.... :/
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:58:32
Does purse.io fit the bill? Perhaps linking an Amazon account could be considered a form of verification, but at least it's very quick.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:35:33
That's insane, if true. The dangers seem obvious.  It is a little strange that the China situation is not more in our faces right now.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:17:30
Bitcoin is for everyone. For me, you, the banksters, and the regulators. We already have a money that is exclusive, this is the opposite one. They should regulate it to their heart's content, and those of us who don't care for their regulations will have the option to opt out of them. It's not about destroying the regime, it's about providing an alternative. The regime will destroy itself. Save as many as we can.

If Litecoin activates segwit and builds a lightning network, isn't it just a matter of time before a service emerges that enables Shapeshift-style bitcoin payments through the Litecoin lightning network?

They were one of the first to accept it. 2013? All of us knew back then.

How about assigning a weight score to each article as well, based upon the average number of visitors to the source web site?
A good article on a niche site should not be able to counterbalance a negative article on a major news outlet.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:57:01
I have to wonder what is the logic of someone in a short position on Bitfinex right now? Do they think there will be a sudden influx of people sending their BTC there to trade for USD that they can't take out? Also, if that does happen, the reward is USD that you can't take out. So....
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:34:54
A weight score doesn't have to be subjective, it can just be statistics from Alexa or similar.

I'm familiar with the concept, and it's great. Let's not confuse the ability to prove reserves with the inability it operate a fractional reserve.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:02:02
So you're worried about the scenario where bitcoin usage steadily declines, forcing so many miners out that all of their old equipment can be purchased in order to destroy the network?
To me, this is like worrying about an unprofitable business being bought out and dissolved by a competitor. It was going to go bankrupt anyways, they would be wasting their money on it.
To be clear; you don't get anything for shutting it down, in fact, it will cost you. And the only scenario where this is possible is the one where we all stop using it anyways, so... why do we care?
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:23:21
Dude, if you think an exchange can't operate on fractional reserve with bitcoin, you need to read up a little more. Also, seriously consider getting your coins out of the exchange.
