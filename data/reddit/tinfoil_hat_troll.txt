Thanks! And yes, many people I know were laid off due to downsizing as well.

As any university student in North America would say, yes the education fees have brought me to my knees.

I'm using an Nvidia 8400gs. Some claim this was the worst graphics card that Nvidia has made to date =\

No PCI-e slot or an AGP slot on the computer. It's an hp a805n which features *gasp* PCI slots! I was using an Nvidia 8400gs (PCI) edition to do my mining.
I do have another motherboard with a PCI-E X16 slot but no GPU to take advantage of the slot haha.

Yup, 20 is dead-on. It's the time of life where all employers basically hate you. My program also has no co-op to obtain experience. As a result, I am volunteering on my time which is basically working for free.

Applied at 5 locations, 0 responses. The problem with finding a job is the lack of experience with what's currently available in the market.
Additionally, employers do not like the fact that you're a current undergraduate student. They would much rather spend the time and money training someone they know will stick around after the summer is over. With my courses, that isn't a guarantee I can make.

Yup. The solution to the problem is the problem

$4 a month according to the chart :) The question is, would joining a pool increase this amount?

I just joined deepbit but mtred has been pointed out so I may switch over. My GPU MH/s is 2.3. Any ideas how much I can make if I used the optimal settings?
