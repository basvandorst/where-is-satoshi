No because the bitcoin in banned countries just gets sent out to other countries before the ban takes place. They usually give a few months warning like China did. The only time the supply would shrink would be if the regulators seized the wallets of exchanges and destroyed it.

There's no need to panic until we go under $10k. There's a ton of support between $13k and $10k.

Congratulations to everyone who just bought the bottom.

Bitcoin will never go under $13k again.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:43:49
4-digit bitcoins are possible

Everyone who sold this morning will regret it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:15:36
It's higher now.

How many times is fake China news going to tank the markets. It should be immune to this shit by now.

A lot of us have already cashed out our initial investments so we're just trading the house's money now for fun and extra gains. I can understand why new buyers are feeling nervous.

Congratulations to everyone who bought the bottom.

There's still about $2k worth of support before the real panic starts. I'm not worried until then.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:25:26
Yes, see

Bitcoin is recovering nicely. I bet everyone who sold this morning is starting to feel regret.

Congratulations to everyone who bought the bottom.

It depends on your country's tax rules. Some require one method or the other, and some let you decide how to do it as long as you do it consistently.

This is the bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:29:17
As I've said many times before, there is a ton of support between here and $10k so until it breaks $10k there's no reason to panic.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:45:25
What is the bottom?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:36:06
FIFO or average cost.

Live in a tent if you have to. It's not a loss until you sell it.
