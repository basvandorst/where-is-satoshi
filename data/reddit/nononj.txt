Bitcoin needs a decentralized exchanger and a faster decentralized miner (P2Pool is so small).

Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Curacao, Hong Kong, Philippines, Thailand... 
There are several options.

Wrong because they wrote about "create". When a miner mine a block he only find the solution he do not create anything.
You can't comply to a wrong rule.
My take move to another country the US is dangerous to your finance, your liberty and your live. It is a dying country.

I'm a Russian. How the US will make it?
I expect the WW3 before it happen.

Wrong because you only find the solution and broadcast it... You have not created anything. The network accept it and you get the coins 'cause you have found the solution.
FinCEN is wrong. A good hacker and a lawyer will clarify this point.

Move to another country. US has no way to force a miner from another country like Russia to comply to anything. US has no power over Russia or China. I expect the WW3 before it happen.

Bitcoins ARE NOT CREATED by miners. When you mine it you just FIND IT.
If the FinSEN made this trying to regulate the Bitcoin mine business they made it wrong.
Anyway if you are afraid of this move to another country. US is no more the land of freedom.

Is not Mircea Popescu a sociopath?

How the US will enforce this if my miner operation is in Russia?
No way sorry.

Move it to Russia. Russians are using virtual currency more than banking and credit cards for several years.
