It would be absurd to think that you'll find anonymity that would beat a criminal investigation in any currency. A 'turnkey' anonymous option would just give a false sense of security when at that point an investigator would just follow the communication surrounding the transaction not the transaction itself. 
The openness of the blockchain is a feature not a bug.

No cash as I recouped any initial investment.  Compared to the 20 or so coins I lost there in 2011 what was there was nothing.  This story will take a while to play out.  
I liked a tweet I saw about bitcoin being built to function like a currency from 1880... and failing like one.  Still a fun thing to play with, but I never had much USD in the game. Most of my coins just sit in cold storage now.

That's a good question. But I think the easiest way is to look at the population in terms of the combination of income, spending, account balances,  outstanding obligations, etc (normalized per annum?) and take the top percentile or so and that's the ultra elite. The top 5 or 10 percent would be the regular elite. 
As an American I'm pretty sure I'm easily in that 10%, but due to the damn Pareto curve almost everyone sees a steep and or long climb to the top of the ladder, myself included.

I'm cueing up a wistful violin solo piece to accompany your statement. 
Reread what you wrote and try to apply "misunderstanding the law" to any law you break in the future. The rule of law is not based on the lawbreakers conception of the laws. There is a fancy Latin phrase which means you can't even break a law you should reasonably assume exists. 
In this case the form was black and white. If they had a lawyer advising them when they filled it out, then perhaps they have some legitimate argument against the seizure.

I think the idea is that the state shouldn't link its currency to a fixed asset like gold, oil, salt or bitcoins. For example widespread quantum computing based smartwatches and yottabyte quark based storage could make a bitcoin look like a telegram while the $ as a chartalist concept would maintain.
They aren't mutually exclusive otherwise MMT would say people *don't* buy gold. But it doesn't, it merely states that a government should base its currency on the overall value of the country and what the market will pay.

As I said it would be crazy to "switch" but it could be brilliant to accept bitcoin as a full fledged currency.  Then you could manage your own currency to adjust that exchange rate as you see fit.  Could be kind of brilliant if you adjusted fast enough.

Allow me to speculate that any official Chinese response is 'good' for bitcoin.  If the response is crushing intolerance that's not good for freedom in China, but it would give the free world a reason to respond with support for BTC. 
Better for everyone, would be if China accepted bitcoin with something along the lines of the FinCEN statement.  Nothing sweeping, just an acknowledgment that BTC is not illegal in and of itself, but using it for illegal purposes is as illegal as using platinum, sea shells, RMB, etc for illegal activities.

I liked the comments section of the recent new economics perspectives blog post on bitcoin. The article has some misinfo, but it does get into the nitty gritty of the definition of a currency vs an asset. In the comments the misunderstandings are ironed out and I've begun to see bitcoin as a highly transferrable asset/unheard of accounting system, more than a 'true' currency. That term has too much baggage, imho.

The response you would hear is that you'd be conceptually rich in the decentralized bitcoin economy. But since nearly everyone pays their debts, taxes, employees, etc in local currency that's kind of a dreamy concept.

The US government will maintain its reserve note monopoly.  The bitcoin network is just creating value that can be measured in dollars, but the two are separate.  The US will not start loaning out bitcoin, or accepting bitcoin or any other such nonsense.  We have a managed floating currency because in many ways it is technologically superior to bitcoin.  The USD is a complicated mess, of course, not 100kloc in a github repo, but it can do amazing things when the government puts it to use.  
The main thing where btc bodes extremely well for government use is moving money across borders.  The CIA and other covert ops people &lt;3 the ability to avoid *other* countries' customs and being able to move in cash value digitally is radical and useful.
I suppose you have read the FinCEN statement on bitcoin?  It is clear that there is no federal issue with bitcoin as a separate distributed digital currency.  Anymore than there is a federal issue with the existence of the peso.

If you're doing something illegal and you're afraid of getting caught. Well... this is proof that you should be afraid because people are actively trying to get you. Now what we can work on is exactly what is illegal. You can pick your battles there, but at one point you could own and rape people in this country legally. That shit body of law was excised in blood.  Still injustice lies within our legal system, but it gets better through civic engagement (thankfully not civil wars).
If you are brave enough to go one step further into civil disobedience you better line up your social media presence, your news outlets, your lawyers and your message. Otherwise you're just another crackerjack breaking the law for shits and giggles.
In the meantime, most of the real work of changing how our executive branch functions happens through gaining a voice and power within the system, through legit means. 
You may not agree with the NSA's actions, but they have a mission to fulfill just like NASA, the EPA, HHS, etc. Being scared of what they can do is why it is so important to engage with your representatives wrt what they can *legally* do.

I wrote "which means" but it made no sense to use that phrase.  My bad.
Basically a government can issue currency and ask for some back in taxes.  That's what the US does, China does the same thing.  USD and RMB are worth something because they can settle debts with their respective governments and those governments are very powerful.

Mainly ipad, but sometimes I'll fiddle around on the phone too. I've written/recorded songs with the multitrack recording apps and a guitar.   Android is just behind in developer adoption for those sorts of things because it wasn't a priority early on. 
JACK (a Linux staple for low latency audio) has been ported to iOS. Not so for Android. I don't really know the details, but android got better in many ways because the hardware sped up to meet its needs. The software stack that comes with your phone does some awesome stuff, but the app ecosystem is buggy, rootkit prone and not well adopted by many of the best mobile developers.

The case has always been that usd (physical money) is less easily traced than bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions were tracked in house by the FBI for the Silk Road indictment. 
Now a private corp is hoping to commodify this tracking and green flag red flag certain inputs and outputs on the blockchain. Te government buys some tech from startups, but in this case some FBI agents could figure out blockchain transactions in house. Buying such a service would be silly. 
As for commercial entities, if bitpay/mtgox/campbx/coinbase etc are on fine legal footing what is the "added value"?  
There's just no compelling use case for consumers either. And that's all they have. 3 PDFs outlining 3 things nobody is asking for. 
That said our congress is susceptible to lobbying power so I wouldn't be surprised to see some buy in. If they really went for it and signed a contract with the us government I'd be quite amused.  I expect they will stay around for a few quarters, but without a serious business plan revamp and probably a corporate rebranding they are already dead in the water.

You're generalizing about "the founding fathers" so unless you can cite all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence I'm not hearing it. There was resistance to a central bank, but the crisis of the early 1800s necessitated it. 
I don't think there is a non-nationalistic/political reason to support the dollar. If I was Chinese I would rather the RMB stood as the world's sovereign currency. 
But I can argue for the existence of floating currencies in general: "shit happens."  Floating currencies can pay for disaster response, welfare, warfare, food regulations, NASA, NSF, NIH, NIMH, etc. A limited amount of *anything* can't expand and contract like that. 
Bitcoin is the goddamn coolest Internet protocol since BitTorrent and possible http, but it probably won't replace the dynamism of democratically controlled currencies, merely extend and augment it as another store of value and method of exchange. 
Could it or another protocol crash the international banking system? Anything is possible I suppose, but I'm not one to support the fall of currencies and the human toll of such events.

I agree fully on your second point.  I personally think that big words like libertarian, communitarian, socialist, isolationist, blah blah, are merely touchstones people cling to in our extremely messy world.
But back to your ~~second~~ first point.  
The BLS in the US takes a great snapshot of the economy with the Consumer Price Index (and soon chained cpi).  With that snapshot it shows that (disregarding energy with gives you a +/- 7%) we have an inflation rate of ~2% annual over the past decade.
For the time being the value of a bitcoin is going up by well over 100% annually.
I don't want to do the math now, but until the increase in bitcoin value approximately matches or is less than the CPI, I don't see why I would ever spend them *rationally*.  It doesn't mean I won't, it just means it wouldn't be in my best interest.

Even when the price goes down to $25, err I mean if, the bitcoin network will have an inherent technical value.

Exactly.  The way I look at it, the USD is worth so much because the USGov cares so much about it.  Dictating that distributed virtual currencies (mainly BTC at this point) can be exchanged for cash with approx the same restriction as exchanging handcrafted pottery for cash is pretty amazing.
On top of that saying that we can exchange BTC for limitless amounts of pottery all day is pretty awesome.  It's common sense to me and most people, but I think there is a certain fear of treating BTC like we would treat physical objects of value (cars, etc) which get taxed on exchange for money. 
As is, this statement neatly limits what can be done to regulate distributed currencies to something rational and relatively enforceable.

That seems like a silly decision for the world economy to make then, doesn't it?
It's like saying if all of the nuclear powers fired their most powerful weapons at one another the earth would be RUINED.  Well, duh... it would be.
But luckily none of them do.  In this case it's even more crazy because you seem to imagine a moment in time where the entire world would switch to a different reserve currency?  Which one would step up?
Would we not see that coming? 
The main issue with your term WORTHLESS is that all federal debts we have from social security to foreign debt to domestic debt are denominated in dollars.  So if we owed you X amount when the dollar was backing everything, we still owe you X amount when the Euro, or the rupee or the RMB (??) backs everything.  
That *protects* us from the horror show scenario you are imagining.
Now look at the fall of the Soviet Union and that hyperinflation, if the soviets had done a better job of protecting their currency during that transition you wouldn't have seen the creation of the oil oligarchs and the impoverished masses there.
We, the US, are very good at protecting our money, with policy and with force if need be (eg, the revolution).

Wealth distribution in simulations and reality follow a Pareto distribution.  You can alter some parameters, but it always tails out to zero at the far end.  Once you realize that fate could put you between that zero and a hard place, you start to look at how your society can help those already there.  Or you can go the "libertarian" route and leave them all free to starve.
I mention this because bitcoin doesn't change the make up of the "1%." At best it contributes a couple more data points to that range of wealth.  To actually bend that distribution takes serious overarching work, and even then due to that bottoming out, you still have people fucked over by circumstances that you have to help.  Or at least would like to help....

Exactly. The managed floating dollar will be around as long as the US exists, but the methods of exchanging that value are morphing. From checks to CCs to debit cards... BTC does that and more. 
I can imagine the US government holding a strategic bitcoin supply (maybe they already do on some of their machines). But there is no reason to drop the dollar or base the dollar on a limited resource. There is plenty of reason to allow a transaction network to facilitate the movement of value, especially if it can be cashed out at some point *to* dollars.

There are two issues in your comment. One is inequality, which has been shown to be 'spontaneously' created in economic systems of all types. The other is alt-coins
The answer to these questions is that bitcoin is just one alt currency. We have currencies all over the globe, most backed by nation states. More alt coins just join the party. Maybe they succeed maybe they don't. If anything alt coins help raise the profile of the entire cryptocurrency idea. The question of wealth condensation is a good argument for keeping fractional reserve banking. We are so used to see money being 'printed' to help the ultra wealthy that we've forgotten that one of the most important uses of creating money is to spend it on raising the prospects for the middle class and poor. We can't stop the ultra rich from being rich, but we can allow the working poor to afford food, education, etc.
So some countries do just that, the US doesn't so much. Bitcoin never could, any more than gold or silver could. To me that points to the need for a heterogeneous currency landscape, not one currency to rule them all (aka USD, BTC, CNY, etc). They each have their place and to some degree basic supply and demand will rule the pure alt coin world.

Now, the Auburn/GMU split of the Austrian school is the laughing stock of the saltwater/freshwater split.  Since the Saltwater/Freshwater economists literally run things (often into the ground) the libertarians are able to claim that everything would be peachy if we just took them seriously.

The argument for Mac OS X is that its core is the Darwin kernel. Initially based on the open source FreeBSD kernel Darwin is still open source and essentially peer reviewed. The security of Mac's have been stronger, but that argument is generally made in terms of user base. As in the user base is lower so it hasn't been hit as hard as windows. 
iOS seems to prove that Apple can handle evolving security threats faster than Android. 
I'm a fan boy, but I've been using Linux constantly for the past 15 years with apples alongside for 8.
[edit] note that this is a pebkac problem. Virtually no OS / major browser or app has been hacked such that a remote user could access data without the user screwing up. It always takes a click, a malicious java applet, a downloaded PDF or binary executable to compromise a computer. With most users using windows most malicious folks target windows. 
Surprisingly iOS didn't get busted too much when it held majority market share. Now android does and its pseudo java back end and open App Store model seem to be a security restriction nightmare wrt malicious binaries.

I'm leaning toward that assumption as well. One high level Silk Road punk gets his computer confiscated and/or divulges his methods. They go in and hit pause on the whole operation. In a way that's a best case scenario.
Ideally there would be a one to one relationship between a dwolla user and a mtgox account number. Then the entire mtgox account wouldn't need to be frozen. 
That's admittedly a rather rosy assumption. I'd love to see the state government of Georgia (or wherever campBX is) stand up for that little *US based* company.

With android it seems that you give over the air auto update privileges to any app you install.

Blue Waters is an amazing machine, but you are confusing gigahash with gigaflop.  


You can approximate that with 2 int ops per one flop, but that's a rough estimate.
The one odd thing is that SETI at home and Folding at home (the two prior leaders in distributed computing) were completely smoked by bitcoin.  A small profit motive makes all the difference.
Blue waters (and other supercomputers) can do far more difficult problems than the hash operation required to confirm blocks on the bitcoin network.
PS You don't need to break into a supercomputing facility to use it.  At most you might need a RSA key dongle, but probably just regular SSH access.  At which point everything you did would be logged, but whatever... take a class, learn something.  That's a great school.

Peercoin, litecoin, etc can all transfer value digitally and verifiably. Bitcoin laid the ground work for a lot of innovation, the likes of which we won't see the end of for ages. 
I think bitcoin and the blockchain will have the longevity of switched land line telephone networks, X25, 1G cell phone systems, which is on the order of 1-8 decades.
The value stored in bitcoin may be like the value stored in your phone number, now you have it on your cell but perhaps once it was a land line.  In the future it might be your watch. The limited nature and first mover advantage of bitcoin should secure a good incentive to always cleanly transition wallet balances when 128-bit 64 core processors run our kitchen appliances. 
Now a BTC worth $12k may seem amazing now, but what if peercoin goes to $2mil each with a reserve currency stability level from their "stake" method of calculation.  In that case BTC didn't lose, others just won bigger on the initial innovation of the bitcoin network concept.

That is an interesting and very good point. Fiat can and has decimated savings even as we speak. In the US treasury inflation-protected security works pretty damn well if inflation is killing you. 
If your central bank goes insane and starts taxing savings... ugh, but austerity/deficit reduction plans do strange things. Just never to the ultra rich. Just against the people who go to work or are looking for work. 
Nevertheless damn good point, since a BTC investment can start at $5 if you wanted. Good luck doing that with just about anything else.

Gold has little real value outside of the electronics, jewelry, decoration and goldschlager industries.  It's heavy and is hard to transport.  It's very overvalued and overhyped by pitchmen and con artists.
Bitcoin has little value outside of the ability to safely transmit large sums within minutes anywhere with proper internet access.  Bitcoin depends on adoption for much of its usefulness.
I would say gold has been saturated for a long time, whereas bitcoin still has room to grow long term (and room to slide short term).
The narrative of inflation and central bank shenanigans is quite honestly an invention of the right wing, and in spite of some of the left's poor response to that fiction, the truth is the system we have *works* pretty well most of the time.  Bitcoin fits into that ecosystem and gives power to bitcoin users that once rested in organizations like banks and western union, etc.  Gold, on the other hand, is shiny, resists corrosion and conducts electricity well.  It's being outmoded (long term) by all sorts of materials for industrial use.  At which point, how long can an element on the periodic table be investment grade when it's main selling point is shininess.

People with a boat load of BTC are just as elite as people with gold, t bills, tungsten or land deeds. BTC is just a transaction ledger that can give us a nice look at what some physicists called the condensation of wealth into the Pareto distribution. 
The question of elites and enslavement is important, but stopping that is not a matter of what currency we transact in. We must act as the majority to better the luck of our fellow man.

People support deflationary systems (gold standard, bitcoin) on what they believe are rational grounds, but the system seems to only work when users act irrationally.  That is, buy things with bitcoins.
I spent 0.5BTC on a humble indie bundle  and $25 on humble indie bundle V.  As it turns out, the 0.5 BTC was $6.80 when I spent it, but now it is approx $68.  
There was *nothing* rational about that purchase.  Any argument saying it was a sound financial decision for my bottom line is rooted in ideology not logic.
I've seen a lot of those arguments, but as an American with good credit, a paypal account and no need to buy drugs or send money overseas I have no compelling reason to use BTC for any transaction I could use cash for.
The only reason is "for the good of the community" which... is a cute argument since I thought bitcoin was founded by libertarians not [communitarians](

Originally it was set so they wouldn't have to meet up every time the country needed to issue more debt.  These days there is pent up demand for US T bonds, unlike at some points during WWII when they had to be widely advertised. Our promise to pay back is worth *a lot* on the open market for a variety of reasons.
The House of Representatives has a faction within it dedicated to halting the execution of federal laws they disagree with.  Debating over the debt limit boils down to debating over laws.  Laws, are just that, laws.... unless one has a competent, reasonable way of repealing a law, which means passing a new law that overturns it, you can't undo a law by force of will.
The idea of not negotiating over the debt ceiling comes down to not negotiating with terrorists.  If North Korea had a computer virus ready to shut down the US Treasury, we wouldn't suddenly drop all of our sanctions against them if they offered to not hit us with it.  Likewise if a small subset of the GOP wants to shutdown the US Treasury, in direct opposition to what the 'free market' wants (aka more bonds to buy), we can't suddenly repeal all of the laws they don't like.
As an aside, bitcoins... It will be interesting to see how they function during this debate.  Regardless, the real cost of things you and I buy in the US will go up if this truly nonsensical buttfisting of our legal process doesn't cease ASAP.

You simply have X + x on BX and Y + y on Gox (where uppercase is BTC and lowercase is $$).  
Then as the imbalance gets high, just do a transfer then.  Ideally the arbitrage would continually go back and forth and you would have enough assets on both exchanges such that you'd never have to transfer.  Only watch your $$ and/or coins grow (depending on what unit you wanted to see your profits in).

The total dollar amount in created bitcoin is less than 1 thousandth of the yearly purchase volume of the top 10 credit card issuers.
There is no leverage.
Now, to say that BTC could disrupt the entire paradigm and ruin credit card companies for good in some sort of teenager's fight club fantasy is not impossible.  Anything could happen, it's just not a viable threat for paypal to make, imho.
I think paypal *accepting* btc would be a threat, but just talking about it is a bit too hypothetical to make the CC companies take notice.

Some popular GPU miners are based on OpenCL which is nice because you can code it in C or as a python extension and it will run in parallel (and vectorized) on nvidia, ati and CPUs.

Personally not tax avoidance or anarchy.  I think btc was founded by someone who didn't trust central banks.  I personally do "trust" the US Fed and the US system of government. I wish it were a lot *better*, but I work in my own ways to promote ideas I believe in.  Including bitcoin into the ecosystem of currency is *awesome*.
You can *keep* as much as you want in bitcoin, just don't turn it into federal reserve notes.  If my government is printing money, protecting it with the secret service, FDIC, and a million other laws and organizations meant to protect its value they have the right to request taxes be paid in that currency.
Find yourself an anarchoaccountant.

Bitcoins can't be corrupted in the same way that dollars can.  If a president appointed a crazy goldbug treasurer / fed board and we tried to go back on the gold standard so that Glenn Beck or whoever would get rich then we could see the value of the dollar corrupted.  
Ideally the value of a bitcoin couldn't be corrupted in the next 20-30 years.  
The thing is that corruptibility of the dollar is also its agility.  The ability to sell bonds and create more money is a huge asset for us.  If we were stuck with bitcoins and all of the sudden an unfathomable chinese virus and a few security mistakes eradicated 80% of the bitcoin value in the US (erasing wallet.dats) there would be no way to replace those coins.  With dollars we can fix those things.  Hurricane Sandy?  Boom fix it.  9/11 boom here's [$10 billion](  The gold standard, or a bitcoin standard can't flex like that.
It is more important for us as a nation to have a strong dollar.  The value of that dollar will be reflected in the price of a bitcoin.  Just like it's reflected in the price of a 1959 Fender stratocaster, an ounce of gold, or ton of wheat.

I &amp;lt;3 bitcoin, but it would be essentially dollarization ( based on a currency outside of any one country's control. There is an argument for dollarization, but it almost always favors the strong nations within the zone.
If you consider the entire Internet as a benevolent market that you wish to subject your country to, go ahead.  Instead for most countries it makes more sense to issue their own currency that they can lend and spend as they see fit.  Much more leeway to control trade balance, etc.  
Bitcoin is amazingly awesome, but it is too "pure" to make sense as a national currency. It would make a bitcoin country like an OPEC nation, forever bound to the vacillating price of a widely traded commodity. Of course you can move bitcoin as a currency, but you can't manipulate it like one.  And that manipulation is important, even though it can screw the little guys in the wrong hands (aka lending money to banks instead of spending money on jobs, education, infrastructure, etc)

Ok, let's pretend it was one month ago and we were having this same thought experiment.
March 5: 
฿1 = $50 (approx)
April 5: ฿1 = $140 (approx)
|$ in March|฿ in March| Spent in March | total $ today |
| $20,000 | ฿400 | $1,000 | $19,000 + 400*140 = $75,000 |
| $20,000 | ฿400 | ฿20 (=$1k) | $19,000 + 380*140 = $72,200 |
| | | net loss by spending BTC in March: | $2,800 |
So there ya go, you would've spent an additional $2,800 by spending BTC instead of USD.

Question by question because I agree with you.


I think it is in many ways just that.  The US is treating it like a wire transfer system and a store of value it seems.  No word on what the EU will consider it, but given the current state of affairs, I imagine they will do something absurd.  China?  God only knows.  India, as the world's largest democracy, will probably go with something closer to the US.  Korea?  Japan (they have MtGox)... unknown, but a solid play from a country like Indonesia or Singapore could really push governments to get proactive.
The register is IMHO *the* cool thing about bitcoin.  Never before have we had a verifiable double-entry accounting system that everyone can see.  I could see that technology being used *outside* of the bitcoin ecosystem for transfers within a company, a government, or group of companies or governments.  As long as the 51% attack was prevented, this could provide for security in accounting between business divisions for example.


I don't know!  I don't think you'd want to do that until all of the coins were out there.  At that point I could see it acting more like the price of oil or gold, where it would represent simply the cost of entering a transaction in the verifiable register.


Some people say Ripple can do this.  I tend to believe it.  Bitcoin doesn't offer a system of debt/credit which one needs for certain cool things.


That's for sure.

That is a fucking great school, a great major, and you owe it to yourself to suck every second of time you have out of it.  Whether it be understanding all of the major equations of thermo, or that thick ass orgo book, you can fucking do it.

Amazon started charging tax this year in reaction to congress.  Most people didn't notice. 
Bitcoin doesn't incur a tax until you start essentially selling it for money.  Similar to how selling your car on craigslist incurs sales tax.  It is up to you to report it.  The US govt right now seems only worried if you do more than $1k in a day or $10k in a year.

Absolutely, there were some classics. I got out of the sysadmin game before 2002, but there were all sorts of remote holes.  I remember a professor who had 4 Linux boxes all rooted remotely.  Not sure what hole it was.
And, furthermore, no matter how safe we are from remote hacks as of today, tomorrow a heretofore unheard of and unexploited bug could take out any networked system.  It seems like the large base of users of the main OSes and Linux distros are ripe for a fast spreading worm in this extremely networked era.
Bitcoin finally offers a good reason to break in and steal data.  Before if you got root you could use the machine as a bot, if you stole customer data you could use it to sell an email list or CC info, but both of those are real world crimes.  Extra steps to actually gain anything from the break in.  Now you can break into some shmucks machine, steal BTC and have convertible currency you can launder and turn into cash with far less real world risk. 
It has incentivized script kiddies and leet hacker groups like nothing else has in my memory.

Money laundering is money laundering. It is good that fincen set out some simple rules. If you want to sell coins for cash money &gt; $10k a year, go for it. People break tax laws daily. But if someone made a $70million profit on BTC and cashed it out in one go on Gox?
