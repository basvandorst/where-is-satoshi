which state are you in?

Try getting a vpn in one of the states with no money transmitter license requirement and use a name/address located there. Possibly Montana is one of the few that might work. I'm not sure if they'll be able to tell or care if you pay via a 7/11 not located there.. hopefully not.
Other states with no money transmitter license requirement are;
 Montana
 New Mexico
 South Carolina
 
 Wisconsin

bitbargain is a great buyer experience.. you can also buy using a sepa bank transfer on btc-e.com or bitstamp.net. no verification required - unlike with mtgox (although they get your info from the bank wire anyway, so not anonymous at all).

bitstamp.net and btc-e.com both take international wires.

bitcoin.de works as an exchange between people - without a central exchange account.. eg similar to localbitcoins.com. i think the idea is that everyone will get bank accounts at the same bank and somehow the bank will allow bitcoin.de to initiate or at least be notified of the payments - so that they can integrate it with the exchange.

So how is it that the IAFCU is able to issue accounts to people outside NJ?
@_date: 2013-07-10 23:26:04
doubt it.. it was mostly a networking event.

hardly seems worth it.. you might be better off bitcointipping random threads.

Getting money out of mtgox is a pain.. takes months sometimes. You need to be circulating over $10k to be worth it and most people don't have that and can't afford to have it stuck in mtgox for two months (possibly with some risk of never seeing it again if they get shut down in the meantime). There's probably profit to be made for those that do though.

probably because if they did that then everyone would just lie and say they were in one of those states.

maybe.. maybe not.. i actually doubt you'd need a vpn; geo location isn't that good. i don't know their systems to speculate on passing the ID verification quiz.. but sometimes these things are easier to trick with fake info than to get them to accept real info.

well there's already another thread about it.. this article is just a rehash.. it's pretty cool.. but unfortunately only available for german residents.
