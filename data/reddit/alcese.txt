Of course there was an "alternative" - keeping your coins in your wallet. I don't think the unsympathetic sentiment is aimed at those who tried to cash out via Gox and happened to get caught in the scandal, it's more an observation that those who habitually kept large sums there were taking a significant risk in doing so and got stung accordingly.

If you'd had Bitcoin back then, the Chinese would've had it too and you'd have ended up in the same position ;)
But anyway, agreed. I occasionally sell on ebay and the take in fees is absurd.

For newspapers writing about Bitcoin? None of them can be considered reliable.
On the contrary, it is a rare thing when a newspaper publishes an article about Bitcoin that doesn't contain glaring falsehoods.

This is the conclusion I came to regarding the mining contracts on ebay and the like. I can only assume they sell to people who are sure they can make money mining bitcoin but aren't able to work out the numbers or set up the hardware, and don't trust exchanges. It's sad to see, but I can't imagine *that* many people fit the profile.

From OP's link to bitcointalk:
    17:53 &lt; luke-jr&gt; people should be hostile toward false religions and homosexuals, at least
    17:53 &lt; graingert&gt; luke-jr: why homosexuals?
    17:53 &lt; luke-jr&gt; graingert: same reason people should be hostile to serial killers
    17:53 &lt; graingert&gt; luke-jr: because homosexuals go round killing people?
    17:53 &lt; luke-jr&gt; worse
    17:58 &lt; Blitzboom&gt; what’s worth than murder, homosexuality?
    17:59 &lt; Blitzboom&gt; worse*
    17:59 &lt; noagendamarket&gt; Apparently it is Blitzboom
    17:59 &lt; graingert&gt; Blitzboom: someone who is luke-jr:gay is someone who is worse than a serial killer
    17:59 &lt; luke-jr&gt; Blitzboom: yes
I don't presume to know where you stand on homophobia, but I'd like to think most people are past the "worse than murder" stage.

You could mine on an altcoin multipool, many of them auto-exchange into Bitcoin. With your card you'll probably get a dollar a day or so.

Creating a coin is easy. Driving adoption is hard.
It's kind of like the old scam of charging for IQ test results on the web. If you're sufficiently gullible to pay for that then I feel comfortable enough ignoring whatever the result might be; if you need a service to create your coin for you, then I'm pretty confident in the knowledge that you're incapable of running it.
The only ones who stand to gain anything substantial are the services themselves.

Who in turn had copied Xerox.

Yeah. I hate to be the boring old man in the room but jokes about panties and moose knuckles are the kind of thing that should accompany a beer with friends - they should not accompany a post discussing the workings of a financial exchange, read by existing/potential customers.
Bitcoin has a pretty serious image problem as regards the perceived degree of professionalism (or lack thereof) among its exchange operators. Light-hearted posts may fit the mood expected at Reddit but I'd be inclined to keep the diction buttoned up pretty tight.

These two cannot be true at the same time.

The ethics of the situation from a reporting perspective are worth examining. If a guy wins $5000 on "internet magic money" and you're reporting for a local newspaper it's not a big deal to have a photo of him and his house/car licence plate. If you're standing in front of a gigantic steel and glass monolith it's not a big deal to say "this company is worth $500 million". But when you publish, to a global news site, an article detailing a man's address and say "his home computer might have half a billion in instantly transferable wealth", that is fundamentally distinct from the previous scenarios. IANAL but that sounds to me like endangerment, or reckless culpability, or whatever else in your jurisdiction.

They're also a massively bigger target than 99.999% of the rest of us who own bitcoin. Mt Gox needed to be more vigilant than the home user - much more vigilant. Instead they were, as you say, incompetent. If they wanted to protect the wealth of those who had entrusted it to them, they failed, and consequently proved RoBit010's assertion:


Sadly they will probably not be anything close the last to do so.

No point in locking the front door if you leave the back door open.
Your other points were, paraphrasing here, "the forum has an owner" (...well, yeah?) and "it suffered a man-in-the-middle attack" (the registrar AnonymousSpeech was responsible for the flaw).

The problem I see with what you're suggesting is that you're moving from a *copied* address to a *typed* address. Typing inevitably introduces errors, even for a simplified address system. This creates a situation in which the least technically-minded users are at the most risk of making a typing error and not noticing it, and making life easier for those people is presumably the driving force behind implementing your simplified address system.
If I incorrectly enter an email address and send an email to it, most of the time it'll just bounce, and worst case I've sent something embarrassing to a stranger. Send bitcoins to the wrong address, though, and you're in a different situation: they're lost forever, or fundamentally belong to someone else, and either way you're permanently out of pocket.
I don't think a simplified address system is a good idea. Any simplifying solution should abstract the user away from "hard" addresses and ensure that the identity of the recipient is confirmed prior to sending. Since confirming identity introduces trust into the system it's a pretty clear candidate for a service, rather than implementation into the Bitcoin protocol itself.

It's called "bitcointalk". People go there to have serious discussions about the Bitcoin protocol and surrounding issues. Would you expect "fiatcurrencytalk.org" to be newb-friendly?
The site will not "fall" just because one user had a bad experience recovering his password after failing to correctly secure the account.

Simply blurting out the numbers "in layman's terms" is not the same as providing an understanding. Most people will be no closer to understanding Bitcoin after hearing your explanation.


No, I won't.
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:56:57


With respect, it sounds like you'd be much better served by buying Bitcoin rather than mining it. Mining is an extremely competitive and high-risk endeavour, and if you're not 100% tightened up on your profitability calculations you will almost certainly lose money (you mentioned a recent change in difficulty as if that was something you weren't entirely sure about, and that's worrying).
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:47:37
I think the more valuable suggestion in that post was for people to lay off the heavy evangelising. It often seems like there's a fundamental lack of awareness in the Bitcoin/cryptocurrency community of the fundamental disinterest that many people have in the topic. Many of the aspects of Bitcoin that make it fascinating are ideological or technical in nature; expecting the average person in the street to care about these things is pretty silly.
"Step back and let it take its course" seems like good advice to me.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:39:39


By keeping your coins in an offline wallet.

For a mainstream media piece I thought this was actually surprisingly fair; certainly, leagues better than I expect from Fox News. They've also fixed the typo now (or "typo" if you're a clickbait cynic).






Admittedly, on this last point "subpoena your Bitcoin records" doesn't make much sense given the explicitly public nature of the blockchain. But overall, for a general audience right now, the above advice is prudent. People need to know this stuff. Better they get scared away in the short term by a news story than by getting stung losing coins through their own ignorance/incompetence and gone for good. Bitcoin is no place for the uninformed right now.
