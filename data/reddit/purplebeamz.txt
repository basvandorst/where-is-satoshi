I know this is a tough question but does anyone know when we could expect lighting network to be fully functional for the public?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:08:27
It was announced a couple months ago but I was just able to actually purchase and sell BTC on cash app last night! Pretty exciting 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:06:30
I don’t think the lightening network is convenient for coinbase speaking money wise. They make a killer in fees   
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:44:47
I hear what you are saying. I have thought to myself maybe I should have kept it there longer or not taking it out at all. 
But I’ll tell you what you do sleep better at night. 
And I still check the price everyday but not every hour, overall I’m happy with the move I made. I just started re-investing again so I don’t think I’ll miss out on anything. 
Plus I wanted some money to at least show that I made profit. 
Because is it really profit if you never actually see it? 
You should read the stickyed post if you haven’t already. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:38
I agree not very professional, you would think the biggest exchange in the world would be more reliable.   
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:03
Does anyone ever think if for some reason BTC ever crashed by a lot and people rushed to sell all coinbase &amp; GDAX have to do is shut the exchanges down and everyone would be fucked! Just a thought 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:20
What is BTC future I different type a currency? Is this good or bad for BTC
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:17:26
Same I paid $85 for mine thankfully! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:37
Got the link? I’ve been wondering when the lightening network will actually be implanted 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:56
So are they still matching your BTC with BCH in January? Let’s say I have about 500 in BTC will I got the same amount in BCH in January even after i moved my coins to a hard wallet? Or will I need to move  them back?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:57
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:39:43
Ahh okay 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:19:51
I think that’s a great idea! That’s what I did. Can’t wait to be part of the 21 Million Club :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:05:28
I sold my initial investment and withdrew 25% of my profit just so I could feel better about it.
I do believe in BTC but I feel a lot better knowing I can’t lose any money.
I just started re-investing now again. And I’ve also got the same amount in BTC I first invested in profit just sitting there :) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:39:27
No I live in the US lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:43:50
Sarcasm or actually two weeks? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:57
Yeah sorry I meant $500 in BTC and I started messing with BTC in August so I wouldn’t have moved any money until months after August 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:12:33
I love my trezor but everyone has their own preferences 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:53:20
I wonder when we can finally expect it to be ready, super exciting! This would make BTC more possible to be used as a payment method not just a store value. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:55
Thank you for this 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:41
Solid advice! Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:34
Yeah that’s what I meant...wish I had 500 BTC lol 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:01:14
stop being a sqaure ⬛  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:13
I bought my trezor from amazon and it was fine. Like you said the box was extremely hard to open due to the protection it had and the security tape so I’m confident it was not messed with 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:12
Thanks I’ll start digging 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:01:14
stop being a sqaure ⬛  
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:04:56
Cool thank you for the input I’ll see what I decided 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:13:19
Lol don’t listen to the FUD. This guy is trolling hard! BTC is not a company it’s a currency. 
And no one knows who Satoshi is 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:39:20
So will they gave bitcoin cash based on all of the BTC you’ve bought? Or would you have to move your BTC back into coinbase. I just would like to get it so I can sell it for BTC!!!
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:42:34
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:42
I see oh well hopefully other wallets honor it 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:05:19
What does this mean if I keep my coins on coinbase? 
Will I get double money? Should I move coins from my online wallet to coinbase?
I’m trying to understand this fork but it’s hard lol.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:14:12
Cool thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:55:40
Anyone have success buying at the dips and selling on the highs?
I’ve been a hodler forever and remain doing so. I was just curious if anyone has had good results in buying BTC in the dips and then sell when they are high? I’ve been thinking about creating a 2nd account on my wallet for just buying and selling, is this a good idea? Any advice or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:00:51
Which on is better in your opinion? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:43:52
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:24
It’s true I joined like two Facebook groups about bitcoin hoping to find some informative information but it was all being spammed by people saying you could earn free BTC by following their links. Needless to say I unjoined all of them right after 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:12:36
If everyone could look into the future we would all be billionaires. Don’t dwell on the past my friend, hang in there we care about you.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:50:26
Lol I don’t have that voice inside my head? 
Look at the charts my friend. Dips are good, BTC price value has gone way up more then it’s gone down! Honestly I ain’t worried about it. 
If anything nows the time to buy more ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:09:47
Is it pretty easy to tell the amount of coins you have if you are just using it for BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:07:31
Ahhh okay that makes sense! I’m currently using blockchain wallet (I know not the safest option) I’ll be buying a trezor hard wallet soon. 
So I should be able to keep my coins in my online wallet and still be good with the double coins? 
That’s good to know thank you for your response. 
It was very informative and helped understand the fork a little better! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:55:36
That’s what I assumed just wanted to confirm! Thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:55:16
 I am aware of that but for some reason it was asking me for a picture of my ID &amp; a selfie. I’m verified on coinbase so I don’t see why it’s giving me a hard time  but I’ll try again today 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:34
I think you meant B2X is crashing! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:49:17
I tried signing up for GDax but it wouldn’t let me verify my identity, tried multiple times 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:03:21
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:13
Lol okay buddy 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:36:19
I was feeling the same way man but all my funds are there. I think it’s time to pull the trigger on a hardware wallet, no more procrastinating  
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:03:20
Don’t feel the troll 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:13:32
Says it’s from SQ deals so not a good idea? I figured as long as it’s sealed it should be okay but I know there’s always a risk.
Would I have buy directly from Trezor?
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:07:00
The short answer would be to use the search bar since this question has been asked 100x Times. 
That is all, some people are just annoyed of the number of times this same question has been asked.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:03:13
I use blockchain while I wait for my trezor hopefully they do 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:20:06
EDIT: blockchain is back and running 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:16:13
When you say you spend your BTC do you mean you spend your profit on more BTC Or you just buy stuff with your BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:03:46
Bitcoin Fog use to be a reliable BTC blender but there have been a lot of reports of them scamming.
So if your coins have not showed up yet you probably got burned! Your first red flag should have been the onion site 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:53:41
Will look into them thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:14:04
Goodluck! PM if you’ve got any questions and I’ll try to answering them the best I can. But I’m also still learning myself 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:22:37
Same hope it’s just an issue 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:43:12
FUD = fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:52:18
 Would love to get into mining but don’t where to start! It seems a bit complicated but would love to be part of the BTC community. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:27:47
It’s never to late, plus you could always buy $30,$50 or $100 Worth of BTC. And just keep making purchases every so often and keep adding to your collection. That’s what I do at least 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:55:09
Ban this motherfucker 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:19:39
Question - so let’s just say I keep my BTC on coinbase before the fork and don’t touch them until after the dust settles with everything. I shouldn’t run the risk of losing any coins? 
I see people talking about these reply attacks and would like to avoid that. What’s the best way to do that? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:44:49
Yeah I checked they wouldn’t even provide me with a BTC address. Unfortunately I was sleeping at the time of the announcement lol 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:36:24
Ok cool thanks for the response! My plan is just to keep my coins on coinbase until everyone gets their ducks in a row. Even though I’m not to excited about keeping coins on coinbase considering anything can happen but I thinks that’s my best best for now
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:15:06
Cool it’s less then 1 BTC so I should gravy! Thanks again 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:19:43
Anyone know if I should move my coins to coinbase to get the B2X coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:16:50
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:43:28
Any recommendations for good reliable exchanges? I’ve been using coinbase since day one so it’s all I really know.
Don’t like the whole holding my money ransom until they say so. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:55:51
I fucks with it 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:11:58
This can only help the BTC value 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:43:09
I’m trying to decide between trezor and ledger, which would you say is the easiest to use? And what is your take on being the better wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:32:38
Damn i was not aware of this I will have to try! I’m assuming this is only on desktop version? 
EDIT: I figured it, only have $1.50 in BCH think coinbase is holding the rest ransom. Just wanted to sell it for more BTC oh well I’ll wait 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:18:57
If it sounds to good to be true it probably is - rule of thumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:19:17
I believe that was sarcasm, but it’s never to late to invest in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:52
Sarcasm? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:27:01
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:39:04
No one really knows has that answer &amp; if someone says they do it’s pure speculation.
we’re are all in the same boat 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:31:12
Congrats! Welcome to the club 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:47:21
Yeah it goes back to someone on a forum using that world &amp; has just been used ever since! And congrats. Welcome to the club :) 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:02:29
This was the only similar page I found which doesn’t have what she’s showing. Not saying it’s not true just not seeing what she’s seeing, not sure how she got there though 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:50:55
I clicked on the tweet but I’m confused because they are replying to an exchange? I also have an amazon seller account and would like to see if it shows up on mine 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:59:29
Most likely. Don’t see what she would game by that but I’m leaning towards being fake as well 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:00:04
Probably just wants the page traffic lol
