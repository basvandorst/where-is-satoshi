Killing people for their color of skin is pretty fascist for me but maybe it didn't happen.
Letting people starve to death or die in hospital because they don't have money or insurance is also pretty fascist. 
Attacking any country that disagrees on the global policy or to steal their ressources with false pretext is also pretty fascist. 
But I don't blame the people just the corrupts in command that make you think you have a choice and freedom.
