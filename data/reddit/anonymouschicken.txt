Can you appeal on a failure to appear?

US Marshals could not comment at this time. They requested we call back later. When we asked when to call back, the represenrative hesitated and snickered, as they replied "two weeks."

It works!
Also thanks for my first ever tip :)

550, apparently. 22 off ain't too shabby.
@_date: 2012-01-03 07:02:54
We'll have to wait and see. I'm more curious to see how close my guess was.
@_date: 2012-01-03 06:10:09
The best way I can guess this without one is the TFLOP rating based on prior cards in the same class.
5970: (655.83 MHash/s @ ~345W, ~7.07 GFLOP(single)/MHash)
* 4.64 TFLOPS, single precision
* 928 GFLOPS, double precision 
6970: (389.55 MHash/s @ ~200W, ~6.93 GFLOP(single)/MHash)
* 2.7 TFLOPs Single Precision compute power
* 683 GFLOPs Double Precision compute power 
7970: (I'd estimate ~528 MHash/s @ ~300W, ~7 GFLOP(single)/MHash)
* 3.79 TFLOPs Single Precision compute power
* 947 GFLOPs Double Precision compute power 
But these are all estimates. I have no idea what improvements they've made to the cards that might make sick gains in the world of mining.

Please let us know if it lives up to expectations :)

I'd check to see if any precedent exists for Second Life income, since it pre-dates BitCoin. 
@_date: 2012-01-03 05:59:28
That is indeed. I'm glad they mentioned folding too.
@_date: 2012-01-09 06:53:51
Any spoilers you can share?

Unless I find hot-off-the-truck level deals for energy-efficient (by comparison anyway) video cards, I'm making no moves until someone proves that product. :)
@_date: 2012-01-06 10:28:09
And/or dollarfear, maybe.
@_date: 2012-01-03 06:13:50
I made a stab at it [up above](
@_date: 2012-01-09 06:56:07
Whatever I could find :)
I want to see if there's other feasible applications for FPGAs that I can use. As I understand, no expert here, I can reflash them to do pretty much whatever I can design them to do if Bitcoin were to die off. With ASIC solutions, I'm sort of 'locked in' as it were.
@_date: 2012-01-09 06:54:55
I'm thinking long haul. With the power being so cheap for me, the coins having a built in deflation, and Bitcoin itself lots of ways to win... no reason not to be in for the long haul.
@_date: 2012-01-10 08:46:33
The way it pencils out for me:
ButterflyLabs BitForce Single
* $599 entry
* 832.0 MHash/s (supposedly)
* at 1250757.7392747 difficulty = average ~74.7 days to solve a block
* 0.080 kW times 24 hours a day times 74.7 days = ~143.5 kWh to solve a block
* 1 block = 50 BTC = $328.00 USD
* Less my 7.92 cents per kWh cost: 141.38 days to break-even, at current prices and difficulty
* After break-even: subtracting electricity, $316.48 a block or $4.24 a day profit, at current prices and difficulty
If my math's severely flawed let me know :)
Edit 1: bad formatting
Edit 2: This doesn't factor in that if my power consumption is low, I can run this at the office at no electricity cost to me (as the lease includes electricity paid by the building).
@_date: 2011-07-06 01:27:03
And they're back at $13. It's a very liquid market, and a market prone to susceptibilities, and a market vulnerable by its own youth. Will you post when it magically goes to $40 saying it's total chaos? Or at $10, or at $25. It's all total chaos. New uses show up, old uses go away, interest waxes and wanes.

I'm thinking that eventually the government will treat bitcoin in the same manner as a precious metal. In the case of us in the United States, that'd fall under collectibles, even though it's not a tangible asset.
There's usually a stink about how the IRS is going to start taxing Lindens from Second Life, but never comes to fruition.
If I were concerned about tax implications (me and my 0.07 BTC)...
**Get a business license.**
**I would consider as income:**  
* Any coins I cash out for currency (seeing that IRS will be worried about your electricity write-offs, you might want to get currency often)  
* Any tangible assets I procure with coins  
** I would write off:**  
* Electricity as measured from the wall (think Kill-A-Watt) for your Bitcoin mining rig(s).  
* As much of your rent as allowed by law and tax code.  
* Equipment used explicitly for your Bitcoin mining operation.
**Pay yourself out through the business.**
**DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.**
**When you've documented everything, document it again.**
**Pay any tax on income after expenses, with no dodgy loopholes.** You already have the laziest job on the planet, don't be greedy.

Was waiting for "you'll have an update.... In 2 weeks."
Edited addendum: I'll gladly do this fool's job for $15 an hour, while 1) saying essentially the exact same shit, 2) not fucking up his company's PR in the process.
Example: "I understand that you are frustrated because it's taken quite a while to receive equipment that you've bought and paid for. We're frustrated here too because (random supplier of random piece) missed their target of delivery by (why not, two weeks). Our manufacturing team is standing by to fulfill your order in queue as soon as we have the parts to get there. We appreciate your patience and hope to deliver a quality product that you have, again, bought and paid for as soon as possible."
I'll be standing by for BFL's PM with a job offer.

Ah, the two week paradox. My filter to my development customers is this: anything that goes over one week (7 days) gets an ETA described with a date, instead of 'two weeks'. Solves problems both ways later on. I can always adjust the date if I absolutely have to.

And by 'test', you mean whatever production pool is in vogue this week.
As such a business, I'd test hardware on live production pools. Even if I only tested for minutes, that small amount of sweet profit per device adds up over time, AND more importantly proves out the product in a live environment.
