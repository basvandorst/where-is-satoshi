@_date: 2018-03-23 10:56:40
Can we go one day without fud?
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:45:15
To the moon boys, want to buy my lambo back.
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:39:05
[Pump it](
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:20:52
Uhh.. thought we were going to the moon, why are we halting? Lambo is waiting for me.

I bought at all time high when it was around 4k eur lol, was well aware of technology and history (have owned and used btc way before that). Buying at ath isnt neccesarily bad if you think it has a lot more growth potential.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:48:22
Seems like we're going back to earth.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:43:15
Lambo is coming boys.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:48:38
Never knew swatting was a thing, good thing you're ok. Hope you get the idiot who did this.
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:00:58
