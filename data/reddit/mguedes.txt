I am reading the book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"
by Yuval Noah Harari that is giving me several positive insights about Bitcoin and money in general. I definitely recommend.
Two interesting parts of the book about money and what it really represents:
"Money *is not coins and banknotes*. Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of different commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently."
"Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: *money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.*"
The point is, the society is slowly but surely distrusting the bank system and the fact they misused the trust embedded on money. Bitcoin solves exactly this problem, relying trust on math.
The only missing point around Bitcoin is mass acknowledgment and adoption. Eventually, it will be achieved and it will be a point of no return.

In the past, we had a company called Arremate. The MercadoLibre group bought it some years ago and now it is part of the same company. "MercadoLivre", the Brazilian version, is the most visited platform to buy and sell used products and they are expanding fast to became a platform to small and large retailer companies. Their payment system, MercadoPago, is more used in Brazil than services like PayPal. So it is definitely a big deal for us in Latin America.
