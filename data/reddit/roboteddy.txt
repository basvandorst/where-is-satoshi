Per the article, blocks are kind of like pages in a book. One new page is added every 10 minutes. People who want to increase the block size want to increase the size of the pages that are being added to the book. This would make it possible to fit more writing on each page.
People who don't want the block size to increase want to keep pages the same size. They're worried that if new pages are larger, the book will become too heavy, and it'll be difficult to read it (since there are more lines of text!) and also harder to make copies and share the bok with other people..

fascinating! have you ever heard of a virus breaking out of a VM?

This is nonsense. Mike Hearn (a core developer) said in a recent podcast that there is ONE person (Gavin) actually working on making core upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol, and he can only do one thing at a time.
It's true that there are a lot of smart people working on things in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but they're by no means the 10k smartest people in the world...

If you exchange one cryptocurrency (which gained value since you bought it) directly for another cryptocurrency, is it a taxable event?

Actually, conventional wisdom for many-to-many networks is the opposite. The saying goes that the value goes up with the square of the nodes in the network-- the more users you already have, the more new possible payment links are created by each additional user.

This is really cool! It sounds kind of like an on-demand-labor version of Western Union.
- What happens if no local exchangers happen to accept a given job?
- Long term, how can you prevent exchangers from scamming you and or customers?
- How much money do you think exchangers can make per hour while keeping transfer fees low?
- How do you plan on getting over the chicken/egg problem?
- Could you put an ATM in highly trafficked areas and direct receivers there? At what point would it be efficient to do so, and is that the eventual efficient solution?

That sounds unlikely. Where'd you hear it?

Better comparisons:
PayPal payment volume: ~$117 million USD/day [1]
Bitcoin payment volume: ~$800 million USD/day [2]
PayPal daily number of transactions: ~1.7 million transactions/day [3]
Bitcoin daily number of transactions: ~0.25 million transactions/day [4]

I meant the sum of all balances measured in USD. Figured this would be clear from context. We're talking about the same thing!
edit: also, oddly, it probably makes sense to include coins *that haven't even been mined yet* in the market cap, modulo some time discount factor. Rationale: everyone knows the inflation schedule, so inflation is already priced in, and should perhaps be included in the market cap.
Extreme example to make the intuition clearer: imagine there were a coin that minted coins in huge blocks (a million coins at a time) once a year. At the genesis there are 1m coins. Fast forward 364 days: the day before the second huge minting. The price is around $1. Everyone already knows that there are about to be 2 million coins total; when the new coins are minted, the price per coin won't change (it doesn't come as a surprise). Did the market cap just randomly jump from $1 million on day 364 to $2 million on day 366? Or was it more proper to say it was already at $2 million on day 364? The latter kind of makes more sense-- probably lines up better with our intuitions about the "total expected valuation" of a coin, which is kind of how we seem to use market caps.

Great point! Market caps are so weird that way. If everyone tries to actually "get" it, it goes away.

The Bitcoin market cap is the sum of all Bitcoin balances [edit: in USD]. It might make sense to compare it to the sum of all PayPal account balances. Comparing to the valuation of PayPal the company doesn't make much sense!

Agreed. When people talk about supercomputers, usually they're talking about things that are turing complete.

Does anyone know what 21's product or plans are?

I would avoid Mt Gox. You can't withdraw USD from them, people have been reporting difficulty withdrawing BTC, and various accounts of theirs (containing millions of dollars) have been frozen by the US government. They might be fine, but in my book those are some pretty big red flags.

It's true that the vast majority of the work in setting up an exchange is in legal issues, DDoS handling, security, fiat transactions, bank agreements, general operations, etc.
But, good software _is_ a necessary part! I don't see why the trading engine, api, user interface, and general features can't be tackled sooner rather than later.
There might end up being a high-quality reference Buttercoin exchange. Or there might not be, but people who do set up exchanges could use it as a basis and contribute back to it. I'd imagine that high-quality exchange operators would examine changes to the critical path of Buttercoin _very_ carefully before deploying them. I'm not familiar with Sarbanes-Oxley though; does it actually totally crush the concept of open source finance software, or just change the way it works a bit?

This is pretty silly, since the units of denomination (BTC &amp; ounces) are arbitrary.
All the gold in the world is worth about 8 trillion USD. All the bitcoin in the world is worth ~ 12 billion USD. So, according to public markets, gold is currently worth 700x as much as bitcoin.

Apparently, there won't be any lost transactions. From

Eleuthria (the owner of BTC Guild) deserves a lot of credit here. He's voluntarily offering to make less money from the service he spends a lot of time operating, in order to improve the health of Bitcoin overall. He was also instrumental in resolving the block chain fork of a couple months ago. Kudos, sir!

Extremely well put.
