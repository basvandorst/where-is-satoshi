Damn, I knew that I shouldn't get to excited about this.

They sent an email to my inbox and I'm assuming everyone who signed up with Coinbase.

Damn, with the recent win of the voleyball world cup and now this, I feel proud to be polish.

Its really awesome for Coinbase to do this. I know of a lot of bitcoin enthusiasts who were looking for a solid and fast way of exchanging bitcoin, myself being one of them.
**edit: Fyi, I'm not part of the coinbase team, I'm just excited for this.**

They dropped this in an email that was something along the lines of 'Hey come and meet us in London' so there isn't a lot of info out there.

Oh thanks it looks cool, I personally like it.

This was sent directly to my linkedin profile which has a cryptocurrency job on it. Trying to find some news on the internet about it right now.

You're kind of right, countries that use GMT, so the UK, have summer time called in this instance BST but GMT itself does not change.
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:14:14
Oh the irony.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:56:03
Actually if not specified, its international accepted to be GMT.
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:30:48
How did that end?
@_date: 2015-11-01 17:59:32
Well in that case you could in theory put a qr code with a link to a paypal order page. It wouldn't be as simple as bitcoin but still possible and for the general public probably easier.
