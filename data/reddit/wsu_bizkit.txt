FYI, mortgage companies won’t let you use money from Bitcoin as a down payment unless it has been in your bank account for &gt;2 months. So if you plan on cashing out and using the proceeds to buy a house you have to sell two months ahead of time. I found this out the hard way...

Shoot me a message with the exchanges you want to integrate with and the formulas you want built into this.  From the initial specs it sounds like something I could bang out pretty quickly.  $500 is pretty low for a quality programmer, but I have a few weeks off between Christmas and New Years and this sounds like a fun little project. I built a trading bot on the Gemini platform a few months ago just of fun and I’ve been looking for a new fun side project. I could have this done by New Years if we can get the specs nailed down in the next week or so. The time consuming part is going to be integrating with the different exchanges because each one has a different API.

I live in WA and I tried to get that plate for my Porsche but it was taken.  Good to know it didn't get put on a junk car.

What the fuck? Were you raped by an Elysian bottle as a child or something?

Those are rookie numbers.

I got this message yesterday as well. I waited a half hour and then was able to withdraw.

I laughed pretty hard after reading that. Keep up the good work!

Why make a living when you can make a killing.

WW should have kept his money in BTC rather than burying it in the desert.

The day I find that 18 year old woman with a bunch of bitcoin will be a glorious day.

The 25k meme needs to come from a clip of this video.

It’s a 2012 or newer so on the used market this is a $60-100k car. A new one is $120k with no options. The Lamborghini Hurican starts at $260k new. I’ve driven both and the Lamborghini is faster but I wouldn’t want to drive it every day. It has the comfort of a motorcycle.

Fact. When I got my lambo it came with an extra wide plate.

I cashed out a bunch of my bitcoin almost a year ago for the down payment on my house. Kind of wished I would have waited a year...

Just print out a paper wallet and transfer the BTC there.

Hell yea right next to that Space Dust beer!
