It's been getting a lot of media coverage lately and everyone wants a piece. FOMO.

He didn't have a concise point, he just gave his thoughts on cryptos. Watch a few of his other videos to see where he's coming from. He went to business school and worked in corporate finance, but left it to pursue opportunities in Magic The Gathering and other types of collectibles.

He has a case of "old man doesn't understand the Internet".

It's all speculation. Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 different opinions, all of them equally argued.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:33:03
I agree as well because I really do think Bitcoin has long-term potential. You can be a HODLer, while still manage to skim some profit off of ATHs along the way.

Coinbase but the fee is quite high

I'm considering buying some BTC. What is the consensus of this board, do most people here buy and flip, or do they buy and hold for the long term?

Let me further explain since there seems to be some confusion with my comment.


This is the appeal the authority fallacy. Kevin O'Leary is speculating, just like everyone else, with no hard evidence or data. Weighing his speculation higher than others because he "made billions selling computer software" is the fallacy.
Also I didn't strawman anyone - my comment "old man doesn't understand the internet" was clearly said jokingly in jest as I wasn't structuring an argument around it. You can't have a fallacy if you're not arguing something.

Hindsight is always 20/20. It's easy to say what people should've done when you have the full chart in front of you ...

I like your topic OP, but in your post your point is not well-argued.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:28:02
"Bitcoin is at an all-time high peak, I better sell now!" These are the people who are causing the price to drop. Don't worry when they get out, and the "buy in the dip" people get in, price will rebound back up.

I've been waiting for Rudy to talk about cryptos now for awhile, glad to hear his input!
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:13:16
I did as well buddy, I bought 1 BTC last week.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:33:05
This is unreal. And if it starts to go down the buy-in-the-dippers will jack it back up. I really see great long-term potential for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:14:15
It's still a gamble, so don't invest what you aren't willing to lose. I've had opportunities since 2013 to invest in Bitcoin and I kept thinking "this is stupid it's just a fad." I was proven wrong over and over again and I missed out so many times. I'm sick of missing out so I finally bought a BTC. I'd rather try it and know for sure, rather then go through life wondering. That's life. You either win, or you learn. If you don't at least step up to the plate you miss out on so much.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:05:09
That logic is literally the appeal to authority fallacy. "I need to listen to this guy because he made billions selling computer software so he knows what's up!" Obviously in the long-run his predictions were way off.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:10:38
I'd say if that's your strategy, buy 1 BTC and hold on to it for several years instead of just a few months. Don't even think about it. The technology is great and the potential is amazing - who knows what 1 BTC will be worth in 2020 or 2025 as the concept becomes more accepted and BTC more accessible.

* Sign up for a new credit card.
* Find one that has the promotional 12 months 0% interest.
* Go to a place that accepts credit cards and max it out on Bitcoin.
* After 12 months sell the Bitcoin you need to pay off the balance in full.
* Keep all the remaining Bitcoin as essentially free profit.
EDIT: Okay I wouldn't recommend doing this because of the insanely high level of risk, but if you were going to go the "small personal loan" route anyway, this one is much more economic because it's basically a 12 month interest-free loan and you don't have to worry about potentially damaging a personal relationship with someone.

I would put it all in Bitcoin, but I would do so as a long-term investment. I would stress to your parents how revolutionary the technology is and one can only speculate what Bitcoin will be with 5 years from now. 10 years from now.
The only major threat I see is governments enacting anti-crypto currency policies. Whether or not this will happen only time will tell.

OP just wants people to quit buying so there's a dip and OP can buy for himself !!!!
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:52:20
The BCH surge? People are using it as a pump and dump because of the initial hype.
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:00:13
Not necessarily true. Buy in the dip. Sell at the peak. You can HODL while still skimming profits along the way.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:42:14
It'll go lower when US investors wake up soon and panic sell. You can try selling now and then buying when it dips more if you want to make a quick buck, but, there's also nothing wrong with HODLing.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:16:12
Care to post some of the evidence you read about that you've found most compelling or persuasive? I'm not disagreeing with you, I'd just like to see some more concrete reasoning.
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:18:48
Do you have any background in economics? What level are you at? Because if you know nothing, Economics in One Lesson is a great starting point for laymans, but if you're already somewhat educated you may find it boring.

Fun website, but really investors should be forward thinking trying to find the next opportunity rather than hung up on things we have no control over.

I'd like to win Bitcoin To The Moon Landing T-Shirt, Asphault, XL. I'd look so badass walking around the college campus here rocking that.

If you're investing long-term, wait the 8 days. I believe their fee is 1.49% if it comes from your bank account, and 4% if it's a debit card. The price you buy it for is "locked in", so let's say today it's $4,500/BTC and 8 days from now it's $4,600/BTC, and you bought 1 BTC 8 days ago, you are still charged the $4,500 price + the fee.
