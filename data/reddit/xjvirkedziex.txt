"I put all my savings into this"... No offense but, that was your first mistake my friend.

I'm glad I read more into this subreddit than BTC because I'm actually subbed there. *Phew* glad to be here with such knowledgeable ppl.

If their power is out it just means they can't check it or use their Bitcoin. So it just sits and grows for them lol ... I'm just being a clown btw. I get what your saying though

I saw something someone posted in r/Bitcoin that really really made me think. If net neutrality gets cut, will that have a negative impact in Bitcoin?

What's wrong with people....if you don't like something cool.... but don't go around ruining people's days or lives by spreading misinformation. That's just a dick move. An eventually it catches up to you.

Right?! I mean shit....your spending so much time hating...you could spend it on something worthwhile.

I actually have a friend who put 6 Grand into Bitcoin. He may come up.... Or he may lose it. It's a gamble. Adding to your question... What happens if Berry neutrality goes away? Will the government then be able to control and maybe even do away with Bitcoin?

Sweet! Lol probably won't be long with the way the u.s. seems to be sinking imo.

I'm so tempted to buy but I only have a limit of 300... Not sure what to do :(

Does anyone think this is government trying to get rid of crypto because they can't control it? Or just bad media causing a big drop? And do you think we will see an increase again?
