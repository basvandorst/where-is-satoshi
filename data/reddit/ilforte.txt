I don't think no one cares. It's the opposite. He's making Bitcoin even better known. 
The irony here is that Trump himself has demonstrated the truth of adage "all publicity is good publicity"; he had always been a scandalous character, and prior to the election, CNN and other mass media giants only mentioned him to bash him and compare him negatively to establishment-friendly, authority-approved Clinton. Well, see where this got us. 
Now, his Twitter can also be considered a major outlet. And he uses it to criticise a weird online currency of (relatively) ill repute, and to compare it to Official Government-Authorized United States Dollar. 
Bitcoin is the Trump of currencies.

Genuine curiosity, do you have any idea there are literally hundreds of coins with incomparably better technology than both BTC and BCH, which are also older than BCH? I get the feeling that most of the people advocating BCH and/or acting surprised by its rejection by Bitcoin community are complete noobs who didn't know about crypto until 2017. 
"Technical merits" of BCH? Compared to Bitcoin, there's a band-aid solution to block size and a bunch of retarded little changes that add nothing of value. Compared to other cryptocurrencies? There are none, of course, it's hopelessly inferior to LTC or ZEC or Cardano or, I don't know, Verge. The only merit it has **is political**, which is why this is what everyone talks about and why its advocates are so hell-bent on "true bitcoin" agenda, i.e. on supplanting bitcoin along with its marketing excuse of being the first and its vague prospects of further development. As another altoin, by itself, it's worthless, so arguing that coins must be judged on their technical merit is a self-defeating strategy for BCH shills.

It's not a feature on an individual level, how gullible can you be? People only hoard deflating crypto because they earn in inflating fiat, so the tradeoffs are pretty easy to figure out; if they had the option to primarily earn crypto (and it wasn't growing 1000% a year), they'd balance their expenses and long-term plans pretty much the same as they do now. Even though the entire economy as it is was built on the premise of inflating currency stimulating stressful consumption (which is unsustainable in its own right), that doesn't mean anything good for the average agent. I don't want to run in a hamster's wheel seeing my savings vanish, I don't want my money to lose value, period. That may be bad for the economists but it's their fault they cannot engineer a system that's less inhumane. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:03:26
Bitcoin does not need to be technologically superior to anything because it has seniority and name recognition. It's a brand that attracts money. This is exactly why shills use sentimental passages such as "Bitcoin system died in btc and lives in bch" instead of solid reasoning: without the name, Bcash has nothing to it. 
I'm not sentimental. I'm not attached to names. You claim something about the truth. I'll be generous and ignore your hypocrisy regarding Blockstream and China (Bitmain, actually). Answer me this: in what way is Bcash, as a technology available today, superior to Litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:16:57
Man, I would love to see an actual unbiased discussion of possible monetary strategies. For instance, the evolution and institutional support for infalationary currencies, incentives for governments to deal with their disadvantages, conditions in which another system could emerge and function, and if it's possible at all to sustainably regulate recessions and consumption with different means. 
This is NOT obvious, this is NOT easy, this is NOT set in stone. This is a global intellectual challenge. 
Instead all we get 99% of the time is more or less (in this case, more) pretentious "ur dumb and illiterate, naturally {my personal favorite} is a better option, like, it's impossible to disagree with above-room temp IQ hehe, look at me I'm so smart, imma part of the elite group". Even from people who DO know better, who were EDUCATED to know better. 
Which is why I'm not upvoting neither OP nor his opponent. But, ironically, OP, however weak many of his points are, is correct in principle: the illiteracy is staggering. People throwing gold and accolades at this pompous know-it-all rude jerk because that's the first time they've seen a half-read econ student in the sub.
It's just so easy to recite basic textbook stuff to dilettantes to appear a guru. So easy to win. 
Shameful, really. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:53:35
The incentives are also greater with Bitcoin. Outdated as it is, it can rely on brand recognition to provide enough leverage until its most glaring issues are solved. Besides, all of its competitors face a similar hurdle: as soon as you do anything new and gain any inertia, another coin with your trick and a little extra emerges. The technology moves ahead but now you're holding one of inreasingly many volatile altcoins, that won't find any use outside exchanges because currencies need stability and network effect to be usable.

It has lower fees and already fully adopted segwit, and with lower block time it would manage BTC level of usage while mostly retaining said low fees, this is all tested. Of course LTC isn't a revolution, but technically it is an improvement, though a modest one. Adoption and mining power are not a technical issue. 
But my point was, LTC would be a much more convincing candidate for a coin that solves current BTC problems than "muh big blocks are the only true way" BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:47:30
Wow man, that's golden, you're already frothing at the mouth and messing up your narrative with random statements. I assume you have problems with reading comprehension in addition to a fragile ego (lol "muh karma", what an entitled loser), so let's reiterate. You may keep your precious karma (lol), but I care more about the facts. 
You asked a question about technical merits to Bcash. Answer: there are no technical merits to Bcash, as to independent cryptocurency. It's shit. It's about as bad as Bitcoin, except it's faster now but has worse long-term scaling strategy. As a technology, this is worthlessly outdated. One could honestly make an argument that 2mb blocks solve Bitcoin issues a few years ago, however at this point we have coins that are light years ahead; not even implementing any of their best practices (hell, Bitcoin Gold at least switched algo to Equihash) yet talking about improvements just screams scam. Lazy scam to save effort for shilling. And "Satoshi's vision" had nothing to do with brand name, so one cannot justify such half-assed anachronistic fork by saying "but it's Bitcoin, not Dogecoin". 
Do you understand this? Are you capable of accepting all this as facts?
Further, do you realize that this "top 3/$51b market cap" crap you no doubt parroted from one of those BCH echo chambers is ridiculous? This is merely a way to wiggle out of practical discussion by arbitrarily defining what "matters" and what doesn't by a temporarily convenient metric. Yes, sure, it's in the "top 3", and precisely at third place. It's plain as day that this approach dictates saying "top 5" as soon as it falls to 5th place. Cardano – which nobody knew about just a month ago – is at 6th. Will you accept that Cardano is more worthy of being discussed if it gets to the 5th, then? And is $51b some sort of a sacred number to you, unlike 40 or 75? Inspiring confidence, maybe? IOTA made it to 4th place solely by virtue of rumor about Microsoft partnership. This approach is retarded and should be abandoned.  
You say you don't care about either coin but want to make money. I know your type: too greedy to accept the reality that your "lucky" investment might not be as good as shills who sell it claimed. Well here's a tip: there's a ton of coins that get pumped and dumped. You can make money on any. BCH isn't in any way special except it profits off another coin's name and reputation. Yes, it got pumped all the way to third place. But its relative gains are unimpressive, as far as altcoins go. 
You're free to bet it'll experience another pump cycle, you may buy high and sell low, but don't delude yourself that BCH will rise to the top because it's "true Bitcoin" or whatever, as BCH fanatics do. Its name is literally its only competitive advantage. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:37:38
True, but this isn't really a good analogy, because the average user still does not – and is not forced to – truly get the techniclities of the web. It's just what appears on their iPads. If anything, the average knowledge level has gone down over the generation.

I don't care about exploitation at all, I meant that American economy is the world's axis, in a positive sense. Its corporations literally define the way people live, and I don't mean petty shit like wages, I mean the way people use technology, search for information, what they think about, what they wish for, what they expect from the future. Those well-off European countries are objectively irrelevant in this sense, they're humanity's old age homes. 
Yes, people are voting for what they personally relate to. And? On what grounds do you pretend that this is specific to poor Republican voters, or pathological?

Of course, fiat exchanges are a thing, but this is not the primary function of money. What I described is totally a Ponzi mentality.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:25:30
This is an expected, clichéd and obviously wrong counterpoint. Don't pretend that you understood my logic. It shows that you don't understand anything, because you're incapable of reasoning or indeed even reading what you see. 
Stock market is hardly based on total ignorance of most participants about some particular asset; and it's totally not based on convincing people that an inherently worthless asset you hold is still unknown and therefore will grow. Ditto for currency. Ever heard of efficient market hypothesis? The only core feature Ponzi shares with stocks is profiting off your asset. Naturally, the difference is that it's an unsustainable scam. Currencies represent an ability to interact with particular legislations, buy things from specific countries. Stocks represent companies. The valuation of both can go up and down, and that's normal. "We're still super early guys" represents that at some point it'll be super late to enter (because the pool of suckers will be exhausted) and the pyramid will crash.
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme, but shallow idiots like you keep making it one.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:52:16
You're just parroting soundbites and trite analogies. You know what took a while? It took a while for the world to recover from GPU deficit first induced by mining Ethereum and other stuff. There is plenty enough awareness of crypto. I literally do not know a single person who isn't aware. And so I expect it will take a while for those who bought at peak BTC to see their promised "vastly increasing returns". Possibly forever.


The traits you list are intentionally non-central. But anyway, I didn't say it is a Ponzi. I said that the mentality of you and OP and others like you is indistinguishable from that of a Ponzi scheme participant. You hope that your "investment" would grow by virtue of attracting even more suckers (so you could sell it at a profit), so you uncritically disseminate propaganda that says that the scheme is still in its early stages and there are many more eligible suckers, making it "safe" for the ones who enter now. That's the whole message of "we're still super early", come on. How is that different from a Ponzi? 
The important question is not "do you want 1 BTC or 1 dollar". The important one is "do you want 1 dollar in fiat or an equivalent of 1 dollar in crypto, *regardless of price fluctuations*". I don't see much of it here.

It's not a currency at all at this, very specific, moment in eternity which may last for merely a month more. Both rapid growth and inflation make using the currency for trade impractical. But as BTC value increases, it becomes able to saturate the market of online trade. There's no long-term harm in the current speculative growth.

@_date: 2013-11-19 00:20:37
Agreed. Current volatility isn't about bitcoins, it's about fiat money being pumped into BTC. It can get only so fast. Market grows. Eventually swings of bitcoin will become negligible enough to use it for trade.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:07:09
I'm afraid you're the one not making much sense. What you want, what you consider right or nice, what BTC "should be looked at" - all of this matters not in the market. Right now bitcoin IS an investment vehicle, and any attempts to forcefully change that would be against the very idea of digital freedom that BTC holds (also, futile). However, investment and currency functions aren't mutually exclusive. Rather, this investment phase may pump the bitcoin with enough value it THEN becomes a currency.
And stocks are not currency of course, but the difference is mainly arbitrary; also, even stocks aren't as beseless as fiat money - they represent your asset at least. If Apple and not US govt owned Pacific Fleet, AAPL stocks would be one mighty fine currency, I assure you. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:38:30
We're not even at the institutional investors stage yet, you dummy. BTC doesn't fit this chart, it's more volatile. You can't apply this chart to what happens in the range of days and hours. 
Besides, it's too early. Just over $10 billion in BTC, of which 50% will be harvested now. Not a single bank would be satisfied with this much. There's simply no way the big guys will let it stop now without milking the general population.

@_date: 2013-11-18 03:13:37
But well, it's actually a little different. In the face of bitcoin, using dollars like currency is also stupid - the most profitable thing you can do with your Benjamins is invest them in bitcoins. If bitcoin became the dominating currency in the world, deflation (if still noteworthy) would mean less - after all, people normally buy stuff because of their needs and desires, not because of some ridiculous fear of inflation. The current bubble merely accelerates the transition and also illustrates the fundamental weakness of the inflating fiat.

That's dogmatic. You can't prove anything that way. The whole multiplicator-flow-fractional-reserve talk is based on the assumption that the world is working somehow better than it possibly could be, so the idea of inflation=good ends where it begins: at faith. Actually we don't know. There's a lot of hard math supporting different claims, but no randomised trial, no empirical data (even physics need a lot of this), and last time I checked, human behaviour was harder to calculate and predict theoretically than it is with nuclear physics. We've seen each and every macroeconomics model fail at times. And no matter what happened, economists could claim it was in accordance to their theory (in hindsight, of course). On the other hand, I've seen enough qualified people argue that the current system merely benefits the Fed shareholders and co. at the expense of everyone else. So why should I trust the idea of inherent goodness of inflation and fiat currency? Sure, they're good for the casino. Sure, they are made precisely for this order of things and fit it like a glove. But anything besides that is highly debatable.

If you just want to play on btc-e or something, then litecoin is probably more profitable at the moment (it'll most likely rise to $50 and bitcoin just doesn't grow that fast). If, however, you think long-term, then BTC is much more secure and has better potential.

Yeah it is stupid, if we're to judge by profit and loss. This isn't even about deflationary currency. Exponential growth = invest, this is how the market goes. Be it BTC, USD or AAPL stocks. If AAPL was growing right now, it wouldn't be smart to sell their stocks. 
No need to lament the unavoidable. You're free to buy pizzas for dollars, just as you're free to buy them for bitcoins. If you buy a pizza for 0.05 BTC, the next day you won't have 0.05 BTC that have grown in value even further. But if you buy a pizza for 25 bucks... well nothing good comes out of it, you don't have 25 bucks anymore and you could have invested them in BTC. See? That's simply greed speaking. Because your source of income is USD, and BTC is rising like no tomorrow, the smartest thing is obviously to purchase more BTC and spend less on everything else. Not the best time for BTC pizzas, alright. However, if your source of income was in (still deflating, but much slower) BTC, you likely wouldn't convert them to USD so that it's less depressing to purchase a pizza. 
The point is: in he best case scenario, as the market is becoming saturated, the growth will slow down and the issue of "deflation" will be irrelevant.

Oh boy, I lost big time.
Note to self: never ever again compete with bots.

It is immensely more fascinating for someone like me who doesn't live in the USA. Here in Moscow, parliament "isn't the place for discussions", as its speaker openly said. Despite the doubts I have in the good-will of governmental agents present, despite all that CP and laundering mumbo jumbo, I deeply enjoy watching them have an intelligent and thoughtful discussion. This was undoubtedly a worthy watch.
Also, bought one more BTC on the lowest point.

Bitcoin is ultimately a currency. It rapidly rose in price because the govt seemed unexpectedly OK with its existance - at least for now. But that was purely speculative rise, not backed by any actual trade and goods. So the value went away just as easily as it came. It had no reason to stay in the system any longer. All the guys who drove BTC up there didn't want any BTC. They wanted to "buy low, sell high", to make a profit in USD. (And Yuan, must I add). So, nothing special happened.

If it wasn't secure delete (with overwriting the space occupied by the file),  he could try using software to search for the file, to begin with.

I see, this seems legit. Do pending transactions hang on forever?

If it's independent from the protocol, why can't it be evaded simply by using VPN and the like?

Actually this makes a lot of sense. Fiat money system, with uncountable regulations, interaction of private banks, Fed, IRS and all that stuff - it's quite complex, enough so laymen don't even try to understand. And it's used to control the general population, by **terror** of poverty if necessary. So I can see why he believes complex things to be related to terrorism.

No, that's ridiculous. Dollar fluctuates as well, just on a smaller scale. Why's it smaller? Because there's much more value in all dollars combined. As the market cap for BTC grows, the volatility will decrease. At $200 bn. someone pumping in or withdrawing $1 bn. won't even affect exchange rate enough for normal netizens to care.

I just wasted 45 seconds of my life reading this article. It wasn't my best investment.

Um actually the lows were still about as high as the previous bubble peak. I mean the Senate hearing, after which BTC skyrocketed to about $900-930 on Gox and ¥7000 on China and then crashed due to correction. Today, the lowest I've noticed was 840 maybe. Given the volatility, I'd say it was on the level of the previous peak.
And I believe the bubbles will lose their impact eventually. We'll be like: "some backwards politician and/or troll said something vaguely menacing about bitcoins and some people panicked, so the value dropped from $13900 to $13300. So Scary. Let's just watch Adventure Time for now, everything will be better than ever in 20 minutes".
