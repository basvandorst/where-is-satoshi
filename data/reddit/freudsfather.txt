Iota in theory will benefit from large scale adoption. But it hasn't happened yet so unforeseen problems remain unforeseen.

Buy and hold. The dip only took the price as low as it was 3 days before. Buy and hold and then buy more!

Just like your mum.

I think (maybe) people lose trust in stocks and fiat currency. Crypto currencies become more safe and value able. Price up.

It's not his fault

I'm okay paying some fees. They go straight to the miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:42:28
Thank you! I feel clarified.

It's embarrassing thats why. It's only 10k to American's who don't control the market.

I personally feel ...
1) Not too late we are early in this one. 
2) Stick with Bitcoin, although Alts do have value, Bitcoin carries an authenticity. 
3) Within 2 years you could expect a 10x increase - IF it becomes majorly adopted by emerging markets. 
I just bought some more. 
One day soon anything under $10k price will be considered cheap. So you still have a few days.

He's saying - 1) sign up to Coinbase and transfer in USD. 
2) sign up to "gdax" and transfer Coinbase USD over. 
3)Buy bitcoins from "gdax" as it is slightly cheaper. 
To be honest I just buy my Bitcoin from Coinbase. I really like and trust them.

it may be the last
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:31:35
Will be more than that.
