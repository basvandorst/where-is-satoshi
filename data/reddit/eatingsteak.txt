I got some hodlings in Eth and Doge, and it's been a hot week without a standout winner
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:40:14
Bragging about btc, trading at a hair over half its peak value, with Eth still flying high? How bold
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:39:11
It just un-recovered.

MFW bought Ethereum on Monday

I'll pay you $6k for a Bitcoin next week, even if the price is $5k. How about it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:45:17
Thanks for taking the plunge - you're an unsung hero for taking the little steps to make bitcoin 'mainstream'.
I can't tip you in my precious bitcoin because I'm using shitty illiquid cash and can't even buy enough for myself
I can't tip you cash because you clearly don't want it
So have a :]

I have about a dozen friends that were complaining it was too late at $2k. Too late for what?
It's too late to start saving for retirement at 55. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't bother starting if you haven't yet.
I'm not going to bully you into buying anything, but your reasons not do - don't make any sense

I bought in September, and I've been hodling since the big crash, but I'm still waiting for my last laugh ��

I'm a firm believer - from a design perspective - that one 'unit' should have some practical, physical, and 'visualize-able' value
Let's take a penny - what is a 'thing' you can *do* or *get* or *buy* for a penny?  **Nothing**.  It's worthless.  It's useless as a monetary 'unit'
So a dollar - you can buy a candy bar, a cup of coffee or a soda, depending on price - on that order, close enough at least.
A Bitcoin?  Well I don't know.  $16-17k - can I buy a car?  Well 'a car' has a wide price expanse.  A bitcoin could buy 10-20 'beaters' or maybe I'd need five to get a Tesla.
I'd be happy with something in the space of $5-10.  Anything around that order - even 50 cents or $100

Mathematically, I know what I'm doing.  
*Let's assume* that the nature of growth is multiplicative, then evaluate that assumption later.
* Start with a two bitcoin investment at $4k (so $8k)  
* $8k doubles to $16k  (call it an *n* of 1)  
* $16k doubles to $32k (*n*=2)  
* so on...  
* at *n*=7, that $8k becomes $2m  (enough to retire - well, let's assume anyway)  
We're solving the problem for $8000^n= $2 million, and n (roughly) = 7.
I know how do the math part; that's done.  That's how exponential growth works.  
Back to our *assumption* - your suggestion that it's additive not multiplicative in nature - how do you arrive at that conclusion?  What if a friend were to argue that it's multiplicative - what would you say to change your friend's mind?
Those questions (and answers) are Bitcoin-market in nature and not purely mathematical.  I'm not *confused* about it - I'm making a *conjecture* that it's multiplicative and asking why it wouldn't be...

I think Subway is awful because their food is awful and the entire store smells like that awful meat preservative spray(?) or something gross - but I know of one that accepts Bitcoin.  It's in Bethlehem, PA near Lehigh University.

At the rate it's been going for the last month, it won't even take half that long to hit $20k

I'm heartbroken that you're on your way out (for good?), but anything that adds stress and affects your well-being is worth a purge.
I bought at $4000 and the ups and downs are very exciting - a few months' worth of disposable income.  The ups are really exciting, the potential for growth and boundless possibility is great to be a part of.
But the downs, the risk (*is it going to keep growing?  Are people going to stop buying*?), the uncertainty (*is the government going to seize your assets or something?*) combined with the day-to-day volatility - it's a lot. At least with stocks, the market closes, but Bitcoin is never 'off'.
The stress is never 'off'.  The fear of losing your nest egg is never gone - I wouldn't feel nearly as casual if I had the amount of BTC you do (did).
On the flip side, you don't need to keep 'earning' or 'investing' or 'riding' it.  For a $200k at 20 years and 5%, you're earning over **$1000/month for life** by not having to pay on your mortgage (taking a few definitions loosely and rounding to 'mental math' numbers).  
That's over $1000/month you have freed up now, and if you pay off your house, there's no risk associated with it.  We'd all be happy to tell you to leave $5k or $10k in, but hell, if you want out, get out and leave with a smile on your face.
In 2 or 3 years, I might be writing the same post you are.  Wish me luck :)

Before it went *mainstream*

I asked in a bunch of threads and started my own: "*ok I know you guys hate coinbase but seriously what is the best way to turn regular money into bitcoin*"
...and inevitably the answer is "not coinbase", or "anything but coinbase", and "well not those other ones they are scams" - what I got out of those conversations are a bunch of elitists circlejerking about undergroundedness.  All I got out of them was "*ok, coinbase then*"
Exodus seems to be a preferable way to store your coins and swap crypto types, but there's no bank account link.  I support the general 'air' of butthurt over coinbase, but until I see a clearly better option, I'm sticking
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:02:33
Fuck, 
I sold $20k worth of stocks on Mon to buy Bitcoin, and still haven't bought yet because the money needs time to clear
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:31
[*eye roll*]
I can't tell you how many friends I've told about this that say "*oh, I can't afford of those*" - "**well you can buy decimal amounts of them, like 0.01 BTC for about a hundred bucks**".
...and the inevitable answer "*what, a hundredth of a bitcoin?  What's the point of that?*"  
Maybe I just need smarter friends
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:13:13
Thanks for the grounding in reality :)
I meant the comment initially as a joke, then it evolved to be "*obviously unrealistic as an expectation - but plausible nonetheless*"
I look at it this way - $4k initial investment to $1m requires eight 'doublings'.  I just deposited enough money for a second bitcoin so that drops my required doublings to seven.
So on that scale, I'm at about 1.6 out of 7.  That will be out the window if the growth is indeed additive.  Why did you suggest it would be?  Grassroots (eg, early Bitcoin) tend to be multiplicative, but I'd assume level off at some point. I've never modeled this type of thing but was interested in it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:18:25
Well, [removed] would be the most perfect word for it
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:42:26
Hah - ouch.  I didn't.  I'll still buy for $5k though.  Doubt it's going much lower - at least for any sustained period of time
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:29:37
Or you could just wait a few more months, and buy bitcoins for $500 each
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:52:24
This time last year - I would have told you "\*no chance of 5000\*"
