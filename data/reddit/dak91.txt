I'm not asking for donation to myself, I'm asking for donation to La Casa di Sabbia Onlus, a registered charity organization in Italy who helps families with disabled people. They created a project called  with the aim to create toys suitable to this kind of families; donating using the link I provided, will automatically deliver the donations to this organization, without any intermediaries. Users donate to my fundraising campaign like they do in the birthday campaign of facebook, but instead of facebook, the no-profit will receive directly the donations without further steps.
You can see in their webpage the donate bitcoin button, which uses the Helperbit platform as tool:

I always "drop" python2 compatibility for new libraries (python2 is deprecated in my mind). But (but) pull request with python2 backward support are welcome ;)
For this task it's necessary only to migrate little things like switching from BytesIO to StringIO
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:30:58
That's a sweet coincidence :)
@_date: 2015-11-28 08:57:57
youre welcome :)

Memory storage is now available.
I also implemented peer reconnection / disconnection handling with max failures

Shelve is a key-object storage using pickle; I don't know if it is suitable for a large amount of data, but I'm planning to abstract the library from db type, so another db type can be chose.
For my personal use shelve it's ok, for a block-explorer something like redis or mongo is more suitable I guess.
