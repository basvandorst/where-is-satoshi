I’ve been sending bitcoin in and out all day instantly and free lol.  Your a damn fool for using coinbase. Use gdax they don’t take a fee and aren’t backlogged.  Anyone useing coinbase to send/receive is dumb 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:40:35
If everyone we're using segwit we would be back to 2012 style BTC..  Penny fee and instant
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:13:12
It is truth.  Segwit functions as a block increase without increasing the block size. The only way to increase block size is a hard fork which results in 2 separate chains.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:33:45
coinbase will take for ever.  Gdax will not.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:05:46
I would like to let you guys know that I did a major transaction from a segwit wallet to segwit wallet and the bitcoin showed up INSTANTLY.  Also,  we paid $1 in fees but we set the fees to max and it wasn’t even necessary.

Most altcoins are centralized.  They may claim to be decentralized because that has become a buzz word in crypto but they most definitely are not.  There are a handful of good Alt coins most are complete shit though
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:11:20
I agree.  They gave up some very important qualities and one of those happens to be robust security..  
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:12:57
All of the data is the 1mb blocks..  right now it takes 140gb to store.  segwit doesn't change that. So no it's not the same.  Increasing  blocksize has a much larger effect on the amount of space it takes to run a node.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:22:36
Think of 1mb blocks as a small house that your about to throw a rave party in.  There is a bunch of people coming so, in order to create more space, you remove all of the furniture.  That's what segwit does when it segregates the signatures from the blocks.  Block increase is like building a new house.

When we broke 10k we blew right through to 20k.  That was no sustainable.  We need price discovery in the teens.  We are getting it.  We will bounce around until we are ready to move up or down.

The soft fork allows the legacy chain to receive segwit transactions because there are less than 1mb transactions per block..  Segwit acts as a blocksize increase when transacting with other segwit enabled wallets.  
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:23:27
People are always complaining about transaction times usually because they use coinbase.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:28:12
Yes, but the network doesn't have to run a segwit upgraded node to remain a functioning node contributing to decentralization.  It can run legacy and perform just fine because It didn't have a hardfork making them irrelevant.  That's what is important.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:45:51
As soon as he hit send the bitcoin showed up in my trezor.  As for confirmation times,  we drove to the bank and had three as we were leaving.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:44:48
It does not harm decentralization because all the nodes are still running and working just fine.  It's essentially a non event to everyone.  A blocksize increase creates a hard fork that harms decentralization because it splits the nodes up and only the nodes that change over to the new code can validate, therefore creating two different chains that are completely separate..  
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:57:15
Blockchain is the ledger portion of Bitcoin.  He isn't negative on blockchain as it's a fundamental part of Bitcoin.  He is explaining how Banks and alt coins try to use a blockchain ledger as a bargaining ploy to evade the truly disruptive and valuable aspects of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:47:47
It allows more space inside blocks just like a block increase. What’s great about this method is that it gives us the relief we need (if everyone were using segwit wallets) without making it harder for people to run full nodes therefore keeping robust security and decentralization.  Once we start increasing blocks (not saying a small increase won’t ever be necessary) it sends us down a path straight to centralization. People want immediate results right now because they are scared another coin will take BTC place and they lose their investment.  But Bitcoin Isn’t here to make us rich,  it’s here to do something revolutionary and it’s not going to give in to cheap scaling solutions for people’s short term financial gains.  It’s going to keep its valuable qualities and scale correctly. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:51:27
Soft forks are not separate chains.  Nothing misleading about it man.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:59:04
segwit2x would've been a blocksize increase.  Segwit was not a block increase it is still 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:41:28
You’re not understanding that lightning is a second layer.  The important properties are already embedded in Bitcoin.  The first layer is where it is important for us to be able to run full Bitcoin nodes and lock in robust security and decentralization.  Although the people that care to run full nodes will be running lightning as well. Myself included.

Basically when the economy took a hit in 2008 we have been pumping extremely large amounts of new fiat into it just to keep it afloat.  When we do this we have an excess of really cheap money going around for banks to lend out.  When Banks have a large supply of money to lend that means cheap interest.  Now if they don't have the excess money to lend intrest goes up.

I don't think anyone knows exactly how this will turn out.. But we do have examples of many other systems that use the model...  Every one of them have ended in hyperinflation and turmoil..  Will this be different?  I guess we will have to wait and see.

People are going to try and leach off of the Bitcoin name.  Doesn't matter how perfect it is.  Con men will con people it's what they do.  People who actually understand the tech don't fall for this though.  The most important thing to ingrain into the protocol is decentralization and robust security.  Bitcoin will scale correctly without giving up its most valuable traits.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:25:48
The way capitalism works is when a business model fails, it dies, and new better models win.  What fiat has done is encourage shady business practices to run rampant and allow their eminent failure be bailed out (not how capitalism works).

Honestly,  It is no different than the other forked coins.  It's just another alternative coin that has a wealthy con artist marketing it.  If immediate lower fees are an issue there are thousands of lightning fast coins for sending money around exchanges.  bitcoin gold, bitcoin cash, bitcoin diamond all have the same future.  Centralization.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:37:07
Your being foolish to believe this.  I understand it seems like a cheaper bitcoin but it’s exactly that.  A centralized knockoff.  The developers behind it are complete trash also.

If you’re new to bitcoin and are freaking out, confused, scared etc... let me tell you something.  This is a regular occurrence!  It happens every other month or so.   It’s always the same thing too.  All the naysayers come out to bash bitcoin and shill.  
Everyone gets a doom and gloomy etc. Then guess what?   Something magical happens...  Bitcoin pulls out his massive green dildo.   It’s an amazing sight and it shuts everyone up real quick. He usually waits to whip it out when all the newbies decide to sell at the bottom. I know because it happened to me.  After your first lesson it gets easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:40:09

Where is the bottom you ask?  It's close to around 10k you can always tell from where the HUGE volume picks up and the big players really start soaking up those coins. They are after those coins.  We may tap 9k but I wouldn't hold my breath because once they get their fill they run the price up and leave us in the dust.  hodl or get those buy orders in if your looking to take advantage of the situation.  good luck

Not scaling to 2mb was an expression of its robust ability of decentralization.  Segwit 2x failed miserably and for great reason.  We already have increased block space from separating the signatures.  Use a real wallet like trezor with segwit enabled and bitcoin transactions are instant and cheap.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:11:02
Relax.  You still have the same amount of BTC as long as you dont sell.  This is where traders accumulate by playing of the bounces.  The big ballers have their sell orders in the 12ks.  Big money down there so when they get their fill we reverse back up.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:33:54
Yep the first fud attack is always the worst.  it gets easier everytime.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:36:58
There’s a shit ton of payment systems already.  There isn’t a decentralized system with robust security though.  That’s bitcoins best feature.  It will scale with low fees but it’s going to do it correctly without giving up its most important properties. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:47:34
It is not sustainable..  There will be a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:19:19
Managed?  You consider hyperinflation manageable?  If you think the fed reserve has our best interests at heart and are doing whats best for us, you might want to re-evaluate.  It's not even possible to become deflationary with our fiat anymore.  That's not even on the table.

I didn’t mention lightning Network but yes I see a potential for it centralizing.  But bitcoin cash already gave up decentralization and robust security.  Bitcoin has not.  It has separated ithe signatures from its blocks therefore it increases the the space inside the blocks without changing the code to allow increased blocks.  I use a segregated witness wallet and transactions are instant and cheap.  Try it out

Actually small blocks was always part of the code. Satoshi himself saw large blocks as a major flaw that leads Straight to centralization.  He himself added the small blocks as it is fundamental to decentralization.  He wrote the white paper before he and others began coding it up.  The small blocks are very important don’t let centralizers fool you.

Posts like this always show up when BTC is about to fall off a cliff...  I think people subconsciously start to know it and post things like this to validate why holding is good z c then look for confirmation..  I’m all for accumulating so good job but knows that price is about to get way cheaper.
@_date: 2019-11-09 23:02:18
Good job man but these prices are definitely expensive.  You’ll have opportunities to buy way lower in the next few years IMO.   But keep stacking and don’t stop.

It's at 4350 and I'm highly considering buying back in..   I watched it sink to 4305 last night and chickened out.  I believe in the currency for long term but its skyrocketing so fast!  It feels like a bubble but the other part of me says get in because it's nothing but up...   ahh.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:45:56
I managed to snag my first coin at 3800 and sold at 4200ish.   Made a small profit but now I'm pissed I sold.  I'm watching for a dip below 4200 and I'm back in and holding to the end!
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:41:09
I just bought another coin.  I won't make that mistake again.  This time it was 4370 after fees though.  But if you subtract my gains from last time I'm in at a little less.  I'm hodling to the end now.

The blockchain is just a ledger.  A really good ledger but still just a ledger.  The value is in the other quailes that institutions try to work around like decentralization.

Its not going to recover for quite some time.  We broke down from the major 6k support with volume.  We have a lot of price discovery to get in the 1k to 4K range

Hah. This reeks of desperation.  Reminds me of the five stages of grief.  Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance...   This is the bargaining phase.  But they will soon realize blockchain is just a ledger and loses its value when it's not decentralized.   They think they can fight it but it's too late.  This ship has sailed.

Lots of people use it to buy things.  Store of wealth? Sure. The slow transactions and cost will fade as bitcoin grows. It ran smooth as hell in 2013 with no fees.  That's because volume isn't what it is today but it is still a developing technology so it will work it out.  People who have the gumption to adapt to the new system at these early stages will be rewarded down the road.  It is the future of finance 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:31:54
Buy now.  We're stuck right in the middle.  Might go up might go down.  But long term will be up either way
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:16:19
This is an opensource programmable currency.  lots of evolution to be had.  segregated witness was just implemented.  Its working.  
volatility will decrease as it grows.  Bitcoin is a small boat on the ocean right now.  little waves affect it right now.  but its growing larger and those waves arent as noticeable.  The ship has sailed and its not stopping it's growing exponentially.
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:28:21
Blockchain is just a ledger.  Nothing really special about ledgers.  Bitcoins decentralized properties is what gives it value. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:30:00
I'm with you man.  Hodl is no joke.  I listened to these FUDsters last time and lost a chunk of my stack. Way to much stress. Never again.   I have my wallet ready to buy the shit out of any drop.  That plan has treated me well so far. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:57:26
Your welcome.

Id love to buy in at 2500.  Funny how that's starting to feel cheap now. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:54:21
It hit 100 last night
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:05:34
Have you ever tried transferring large sums of money using a traditional bank?  Ever traveled across boarders?  You’ll learn very quick how little control you actually have with sovereign money.  Better and more user friendly is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:53:47
well then you bought to much..  
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:54:38
I bought 2 at that price so your not alone..  If it hits 2500 ill buy another and my price average will be 3766.  Yours will be 3450 if you do the same.  
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:00:06
When it comes to widespread adoption people need simplicity.   Fees are not holding those people back.  Its just that they can't wrap their heads around it yet.  If they cant understand it they can't see its value.  Necessity (failing monetary systems) will also speed up adoption

Traders taking profits.  Then people fomo selling when they see it drop

Saying you bought at certain price doesn’t mean you have to buy a whole bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:36:05
Yeah my friends are the same way.  They all want to buy in but never do.  My friend who said I was an idiot for buying at 3200 3800 now said he wishes he bought in the 4000s.  But if we dip to the 4ks he still won’t buy.  Their loss I guess. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:40:58
Think of it this way... Lets assume you are buying a 1btc we were at 6150 the other day...  we are dipped man..  Even if it goes down another 100 or 200 is that really going to make a difference?  
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:49:09
awesome now try not to sell when price drops.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:14:05
Remember what the internet did to music?  Remember writing postcards?  Sending paper letters?  Remember blockbuster?  Remember carrying large textbooks for school?  Remember all that old stuff technology disrupted?  Sovereign money is next. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:24:04
Yes it does!   Thanks makes me feel much better
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:21:28
I bought before the dip to 3k with the same mentality.   I watched my account rise when we hit 4900 then when it hit 2900 I was freaking out lol. I was certain we were heading for 2500 and felt like a fool.  FUD really started kicking in and As i was setting my sell order BOOM �� it skyrocket back to 3700...   I really had to gather my composure and go for a run.  That was intense.  I locked up my coins and now I'm ready to buy more if we tread back down to the lower 3s or 2500s.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:38:21
Same.

One day that will be 300,000,000.

People are going to rush to buy bitcoin before BTG is dropped.  Then they will all sell the BTG for Bitcoin.  Causing price to climb.  Right now people will start placing shorts.  When it pumps all those shorts get squeezed and boom new ATH.  Thats what I think will happen.  Just an opinion.  no one knows the future.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:03:25
depression will hit them when they realize technology has swallowed the banking industry the way it swallowed blockbuster...  sure they will still exist but not like they did before.   They will have to accept their new fate and join the new tech to survive  
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:20:36
A collectible?   Lol. A millionaire uses BTC to transfer large sums of wealth wherever and whenever they please at no expense.  Owning BTC is a future necessity. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:43:51
People told me I was a fool buying at 3000 then again at 3800.  I was laughed at for buying at 4200 and 4300. After the China news my close friends said why would you buy so close to ATH?  They never bought. I did. I held and now I’m sitting pretty. I don’t mind another correction in fact I’m hoping for one because I just sold a spare truck and want another coin. Funny how low 5s seems cheap now.

now.  price will jump right before the 25th
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:08:27
You did good imo.  Price is back up a bit.  But the real challenge is not selling if price goes lower.
