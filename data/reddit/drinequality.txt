No - obviously - pools are a human construct.
Pool operators can easily pretend to be an arbitrary number of smaller sub-pools to the network.

Once it was widely known, they fixed it in hours.  Very telling.

It's more than just incompetent communication.  Clearly there are no procedures or processes in place to deal with this type of thing.  For something as clearly mission-critical, and in the wake of MtGox, that is clearly inexcusable.  
IMHO, you should be fired immediately (and no-one should buy the book).

Well, in the context of this story, a little bit less so.
blockchain.info really needs to demonstrate that they're competent with security.  Based on this story, their reputation is seriously damaged.

I see no problem in punishing miners who ignore the 51% problem!

Perhaps the other pools should agree to send a message to GHash.io: don't accept their blocks for a few hours!

There appears to be some ASIC-resistance available by requiring non-trivial amounts of RAM.  It appears to be unsolved to build DRAM into any other sort of chip.  So requiring a chunk of DRAM moves the probelm into a two-chip solution.  Plus developing the interface between the two is quite hard.

The key may still be on the phone - reset doesn't mean every bit of memory was wiped.

Better yet, get Andreas' funds!

I so want this to be true - send a bunch of emails and recalls to microsoft and watch Redmond explode with radiation

If blockchain.info wish to claim that it can't be used to steal money, how about they put 100BTC where their mouth is?!

You need to grow up right now.  Advocating NoXT is damaging to Bitcoin and reveals your true colours.  Resorting to deceit and deliberate damage to Bitcoin (as a whole) when there is already a method for voting/acting against BitcoinXT is just childish.

Me too - what a jerk

It seems probable that there's a conflict of interest at play for some of the anti-XT people.  Do you have *any* evidence that the XT proposal is in any way motivated by "special interests"?
