Afternoon, John.
Are those figures using US fiat currency ?
Maybe also include indicative bitcoin price as well.

Afternoon, moodytomatoes.
There's a link above to another comment with a link to construction instructions.
[Bitcoin Logo and Symbol Origin](
Were you suggesting that the slower animations have textual popups displaying the scaling ratio adjustments as they occur ?

Afternoon, Kingdud.


    if (!fBaseNameOnly)
        ss &lt;&lt; "UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/";
This would append "UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/" if fBaseNameOnly == false.
So it defaults to sticking in the bit about BIP148 support.

Afternoon, melvincarvalho.
The initial ideas for the fees were to give compensation to miners as the coinbase amount decreases and to handle spam attacks against the network.
As the level of spam increases, the miners become more picky about which transactions they will include into the next block and will naturally give the transactions with the higher fees priority.
This will either make a large pool of spam transactions that will not be added into a block until the spamming has ended and the level of transaction activity drops back to its average level again, or the spammers will have to add higher and higher fees themselves.
If the spammers choose to add higher and higher fees then the miners will add them into the next block and pocket the fee.
In doing so, a transfer of wealth is happening between the spammer and the miner.
At some point in time, the spammer will run out of bitcoin to use as fees and the spam attack will stop.
It is part of the automatic regulation of the Bitcoin system.
All that will happen is that a typical Bitcoin user may have a delay in their transaction confirmation times until the spam attack completes.
Similar to a brown-out on an electricity grid.
Just wait out the folks using those heavy resources to run out and everything will go back to normal again.
The Bitcoin system is *designed* to handle massive spam attacks automatically.
If the codebase cannot currently cope with one, then that's a failure of the codebase - not the design.

No worries.
I think it's a great write-up on the code changes.

Afternoon, Zepowski.
One was [I-am-not-anonymous](
I ran about a dozen handles over time.
Often I would be running one-to-three characters at the same time which would exist between one-to-three weeks up to one-to-three months, over-lapping their activity.
Some would act as noobs, some as techy-telligent, others somewhere in-between.
Occasionally I'd stuff up and had the same actor act both noob-like and techy-telligent.
With *I-am-not-anonymous* I started him pretending to be a noob trying to run the Bitcoin software for the very first time.
This is so that any *real* noobs would be able to find posts already existing where someone had asked all the dumb scary questions beforehand.
It was also to encourage improvement in the software development so that the coders would see what *real* people would actually see.
Most coders only see the code and many still believe that if someone doesn't know how to open up a *command line interface*, or *terminal* window, and execute textual commands then they shouldn't be using a computer in the first place.
Bitcoin was never meant for those ( techy ) people.  It was always meant for the non-techy-telligent entities.
The techy-telligent folks are the ones to code the thing, but they are not the end recipient of the tech.
Everyone is.
There will definitely be a few posts where I was arguing or talking between two of my handles in the same thread somewhere.
That always [redacted] (2) off.
I made a few posts from different handles from the perspective of a noob so that folks wouldn't be afraid to ask stupid questions and to get threads for questions they'd search for.
I tried really, really hard to make different handles be set in particular time zones and countries so that they'd make mention of their "locality".

Afternoon, wiggy222.
The cash ceased being your own the moment you gave it to a bank.
You then became a *unsecured creditor* of that bank.
Why they have to check *your* identification when they actually owe *you* money is beyond me.
It is *you* that should be doing *due diligence* on *them*.
When was the last time you saw a bank advertisement asking *you* to be their *unsecured creditor* ?
Never ?
Governments have *Know-Your-Customer* ( KYC ) laws forcing banks to obtain the identification of their *unsecured creditors*.
Surely our governments know the difference between a merchant's customer and a company owing you money ?
They're certainly not in cahoots with one-another, are they ?

Bitcoin built the pond in the first place.
As Bitcoin scales the pond will also expand.
If it doesn't scale then another will.

Afternoon, siir.
With regards to the Bitcoin logo question:
The current [Bitcoin logo]( was created in late 2010 by bitboy.
The logo that originally came out with the first source-code release was always supposed to be a temporary image until such time something better was created.
Over 2009 and 2010 many folks who played with the tech would create their own logo or bitcoin image.
By the end of 2010 there were so many different images that every website you went to had a different image.  It looked a real mess.
bitboy showed his image and I talked to (2) about finally nailing down a decent image for the Bitcoin project.
I said we needed two images: One for the currency symbol and one for the logo.
(2) asked, "What's the difference ?"
I told him that the currency symbol is what will be used when displaying an amount of Bitcoin, similar to $ (dollar, pounds, etc symbols).
The logo is what will be used when displaying that you accept or give Bitcoin, similar to the "VISA accepted here" and MasterCard brand logos folks see on shop windows and counters.
I sent bitboy a private message.  Only registered board members were allowed to send private messages.  Because I'd spent most of the previous two years either communicating with the board via (2) or via anonymous board posts, I had to create a new login.
I talked to bitboy about his image.  The first one was vertical.  I asked him if it was possible to rotate the image so that the two would stand out from each other (symbol and logo) and I supplied him with an example image.  I do not recall what image I sent him ( if he's still around and has access to the private messages he should be able to tell us ) however I think it was a globally well-known image at the time.
He came back with his image rotated and, after checking the rotation angle, I asked him why he'd made the rotation exactly the same as the image I supplied him.  It was only supposed to be used as a reference, an example, and not to be used precisely.
He said that because he had to choose an angle he may as well use the same angle from the image I gave him.
There was a bit of back-and-forth, privately and on the message board to also get vector graphics (the original images were png files and wouldn't be scalable for higher-resolution screens and print media) and the "accepted here" branding images.
I told (2) that these are going to be the official symbols and logos and branding for Bitcoin from now on and all other images are wrong - including the original image from the first release.

Great to see the Bitcoin symbol finally making it into unicode.
From the symbols first use in the [logo]( to the separation between [symbol and logo]( to everyone who helped [u/kenshirriff]( with the [unicode proposal]( it's been quite a journey.

**Regarding Big vs Small block sizes:**
There was always going to be a minimum tech level requirement to play the game.
We no-longer live in a time where 9600 baud is used for typical internet communications.
Nodes on ADSL and clients on 56k modems or 2G mobile networks was a starting reference point.
This would mean as transaction levels increased the minimum tech requirements would also increase.
Nodes to ADSL2+ and clients to ADSL or 3G mobile.
At the moment it would be close to Nodes on cable and clients on ADSL2+ or 4G mobile.
The actual block size becomes irrelevant due to the consensus market deciding the acceptable block size.
If blocks are too large for a Node to verify before a competing block arrives then that Node would switch to the easier-to-verify block and blocks too large for the network would be ignored and punted away automatically.
If blocks are too small due to little or no transactions being embedded then they too would be ignored automatically.
Nodes would have a pool of pending transactions to compare against a block.
They would know if older pending transactions are being ignored, or if there was a high *pending-transactions-to-block-size* ratio.
Using an average of pending transactions over the past two weeks would allow automatic minimum/ maximum block size to be adjusted on-the-fly.
Kind of like how the *proof-of-work* difficulty is adjusted every two weeks based upon the average block computation time.
The block size was always meant to be automatically adjusted to the network conditions without requiring folks to try and guesstimate what it should be in any particular month or year.

The text from original paper has been embedded into the Bitcoin blockchain over multiple transactions.
It can never be changed.

Massive adoption will always look like a bubble.
And the current "bubble" will look tiny compared to when a billion more folks get on board and begin transacting every day.

Afternoon, myth1n.
When documents "leaked" to Wired and Gizmodo back in late 2015, Craig honestly thought the gmx.com PGP key was the same one which had been generated and posted on the bitcoin.org website.
What he didn't know was that an "integrity" test had been created specifically to check whether he'd stay honourable over the years.
There were about half a dozen pieces of information that Dave was told to never divulge to Craig.
The Gizmodo key for the gmx.com is a valid key for that email account.
It was generated mid 2011 and purposely backdated so as to appear to be the same as the one on the bitcoin.org site.
Dave was told to never tell Craig, but to give him a copy of the key in case something happened to him.
That key was specifically created to be used within the Tulip Trust.
To prove a particular person was the one linked to the gmx.com email account.
It was never supposed to be publicly exposed.

Afternoon, moodytomatoes.
The different hole sizes were on purpose.
It just didn't look right with them both the same.
If you read the [Introduction]( on the link above you'll notice that the bottom right-hand-side rounded shape was played around with by bitboy and the *undo* on his drawing software wouldn't let him undo the mistake he'd made.
That's why the logo which he released on 1st November 2010 has a funny-shaped bottom right-hand-side curve.
It would be really interesting if someone knew who *bitboy* was and could get in touch with him.
If he still has access to his message-board *bitboy* account he might be able to take screenshots of the original chit-chat between us and the actual instructions that were used back then.
The instructions I've posted have been reconstructed from memory and I think they're about 95% accurate.

Afternoon, biglambda.
The individual shapes were created in Adobe Illustrator ( each one with its own name and sequence number to help in the next step ).
The .ai file was imported into Adobe AfterEffects and a main composition created for the long version ( about a minute and a half ).
Each shape animates to the next position in the sequence.
For the shorter animation sequences, the same composition was reused in separate compositions with shorter timeframes.
The video files were exported out to Adobe Media Encoder.
The complete instruction list is [here](
