It's been years since I've played, did they ever patch the duplication glitch?

It (BCH) also doesn't have segwit, so ASICBOOST is still a viable method of increasing the hash rate of the ASICs.

Minor text fixes.

But they both share the same history. It's only at an arbitrary point do both split off to do their own things.

I understand that downloading the full 120+GB (or whatever it's at) is a tall order, and perfectly reasonable for cellphones and older computers to not store because of storage limitations. 
But I still don't understand why, assuming you already have the full chain, keep up with the blocks as they're being created. Even a pitiful 500kbps will be able to download 37.5MB in ten minutes, which is way beyond any proposed huge block size I've heard of. 


I guess. But even an 8MB file takes just under six and a half seconds to upload at 10mbps, which is barely 1% of the time it took to find it. 


Yep. But that's why coins with higher pool hashing power is important, and what I'm surprised that other coin hasn't happened yet (at least in a non-destructive way) yet.

Curious outsider here. How do you figure that having bigger blocks will effect nodes/users? If a block has a constant, say, 50KB of overhead/metadata, then adding more room in the blocks just makes more room for transactions/their checksums. 
I thought that network strain scales not with block size, but transactions per second? Since nodes need to have record of every transaction.

After sleeping on it, why do you need to broadcast the full block? Can't you just broadcast the hash of the block to everyone and those that don't have it will record "this guy has the new block, waiting to download full block" while the original miner uploads it. Surely there's people smarter than me who have came up with a similar or better solution to swarm bandwidth than that.

Because I don't know of any mainstream game that runs on Power8 PC.

Instead, you can just join another pool that doesn't have a 10Sat/byte min cap on transactions. Or solo mine, or buy a competing hashing seller's hashing power.

How do you quit a miner though? It's their prerogative what to mine. If you don't like it, then join in with your own hashing power. That's the beauty of bitcoin.

Isn't that what they said about litecoin back in 2012/2013 though?

But if you don't control the private keys, then you can't say that you own the coins.

Ok, so I did understand this correctly. When the hard fork happens, I can "double spend" my coins, once per each new fork. So all I have to do is find an exchange that supports one of each and cash out for double profit, right?
