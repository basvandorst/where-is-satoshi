It's also hella power consuming...
maybe combine it with some additional nuclear plants?

That's what I always assumed but if I am not mistaken Bitcoin is actually made in sich a way that 2140 is a predetermined year for the last BTC to be mined. There are only "x" amount of BTC and every few minutes one BTC is mined, the amount of mining does not change the amount of minutes needed to mine the next bitcoin.

That's not what I meant, with "cheap" I meant that Litecoin is right now rather low in price conpaired to it's own price a few days ago while bitcoin has dramatically increased it's value. My bad for letiing "cheap" open for interpretation...

Even if you re-buy halfway at the drop, you're making some good profits right?

I started buying last week, every now and then I buy 200$ and slowly increase the amount of coins I'm hoarding, I am rather pleased with doing it this way.

If you re-buy at a lower price you can actually make some more bitcoin my friend:)

I own some LTC myself (also my first coin), it goes down with BTC, and when BTC goes up it sometimes goes down because people sell LTC to buy more BTC. They are however rather cheap now and will definitely at least reach 200$ hopefully.

genuine question: why would 12k have more sell orders than 13k?

That was already sort of what I thought...but it seems so tempting...

While yes this will be true and really sad, the exact same thing goes for the regular economy. Economic depressions are linked to increases in suicide (lower employment rate, losing all their money when a stock crashes etc.).
So while it is something that would be good of avoided, we will never avoid (partly) money-caused suicides.

I found 20 million bitcoin in my wallet today...is that good or nah?

You need H2 or NH3 to run a fuel cell.

You could always do that? People can donate any binance crypto they want in my streams, just ask and I'll gladly send you the corresponding adress

I invested my first 200$ in Litecoin two days ago, it juat hit the 100$ mark the same day BTC did 10k, I have hopes of it hittinf 200$ soon enough.

From my experience with ransomware, paying the fee doesn't actually solve the problems most of the time?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:56:24
nah, it's way to unstable to buy things with. I don't want to have spend too much on my pizza when bitcoin has increased its value over a few weeks. Naturally, the same can be said for $$$ due to inflation and such, but that's on a much smaller scale.

make sure backups don't fail? Why would a bank buu bitcoin ibstead of getting some good backups?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:26:42
wut, some people actually pay for ransomware?
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:42:40
Excuse me if I am wrong (not an expert), but isn't the point of a 51% attack that you can "create" more bitcoins by forging transactions? That's a huge deal for the price...
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:45:00
ah, so you would need like &gt;80% to do some real damage?
