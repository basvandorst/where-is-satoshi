"We want to eliminate pools &amp; make it possible for small solo miners to get frequent payouts, even if it's only the small amounts they deserve."
So you want to eliminate the primary mechanism by which small miners get a fair payout (pools), yet you want them to still be able to get a fair payout.  You haven't proposed any way to achieve that goal.  So, you're basically just demanding that a solution appear out of nowhere.  Do you understand that programmers are humans, not wish-granting genies?
You got one part right though, because that is ridiculous.

I remember seeing Hal Finney give a talk introducing RPOW in San Francisco at CodeCon 2005.  It was a pretty small event, maybe 150 people total.  There were a lot of great things introduced at CodeCon (TOR being another significant example) and I'm glad I had the chance to participate.  (I presented something there in 2004.)
I haven't looked into any of the claims for or against Hal being Satoshi, but whether he is or not it seems pretty clear that Bitcoin wouldn't exist without the work Hal did.

I assume you mean "tell your engineers to get back to work". The CEO isn't the one making the GPUs.

I'm not sure what your point is.  The NVIDIA engineers don't manufacture the GPUs, but they design them. NVIDIA doesn't manufacture any chips themselves (they subcontract that to chip fabrication companies like TSMC), so you could argue that NVIDIA isn't **making** the GPUs at all.  But that would be a pretty pointless distinction, since without NVIDIA and its engineers designing GPUs we wouldn't have them.

That is a probably the best analysis of the issue I've seen.  I wish I had seen it sooner.

Seems unlikely.  They haven't bothered with that makret, leaving it to other vendors like Cavium.

I'm guessing that anyone running a node over Tor would be counted in the country of their Tor exit node.

IANAL but it seems to me that [the FinCEN guidance released earlier this year]( suggests that if you operate one of these machines you might have to register as a "money transmitter".

Suggesting that a different proof-of-work function would keep ASIC hardware from dominating Bitcoin mining makes about as much sense as the notion that if the content industry could just come up with the right copy-protection scheme they could stop all those dastardly pirates.  No matter what proof-of-work algorithm you choose, there will always be a way to build custom hardware that will perform better than a general purpose computer.  (If you think that the ~130kB of memory used by Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is a serious barrier to building custom hardware to run that algorithm, you're dreaming.  It's smaller than the L1 cache on most CPUs, so clearly it's possible to build that much fast memory into a chip.  Even if the amount of memory was up in the GB range, you could just put a dedicated memory interface on the ASIC, or probably more than one to increase bandwidth.)  As long as there's an economic reward, someone will build it.
It would be a big setback for the people and companies that have invested in the current crop of mining hardware, but it would only be a matter of time until custom hardware dominates again.  Why bother with the disruption of changing the proof-of-work to temporarily redistribute the mining power until the next hardware designs come on line?  What's the real benefit in doing that?  It's fighting a battle that you're doomed to lose.

Hasn't [sx the command-line wallet supported deterministic wallets for a while already](  It's not a fancy GUI, which a lot of people want, but the headline here seems a little overblown.

Is there a list of which US states are allowed?  You've indicated that Calidornia is not, but are there any which are?
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:12:56
Absolutely true.  Intel's earnings in Q1 of this year were $12.6B (9x the current market cap of all Bitcoins in circulation).

Suppose I'm a small-time miner with a garage full of ASICs and I want to sell some coins through localbitcoins.com or bitcoin-otc.com or some other method outside an established exchange.  A strict reading of the FinCEN guidance suggests that I should be doing KYC.  Would your service be useful for me, or is it more aimed at larger operations?  What if I don't want to set up my own web site using your API, can I do everything through your site's web dashboard?

When the details came out today, the seizure did seem fairly reasonable based on the FinCEN guidelines.  I took the time to read them when it came out, and I'm just an individual.  It looks very much to me like Mt.Gox simply ignored the FinCEN publication altogether.  Customers shouldn't fault the US government over this, but they should be mad at Mt.Gox for failing to follow through on the neccessary regulatory compliance.  It makes them seem incompetent, and should make one question whether they're worth trusting with your money (whether fiat or BTC).

Thanks for the reply, and also thanks for Trezor!  You guys are doing great work.

I've been wondering something about this: the host computer will have to know the master public key and the hierarchichal key "path" used to generate the address being used for a transaction, right?  I mean, there's no way to enter the list of numbers for the key hierarchy on the Trezor itself since it only has 2 buttons.
Personally I think it would be preferable to have only the Trezor know the master public key and the key path, but I'm guessing there's no way to avoid revealing that information to the host computer.
