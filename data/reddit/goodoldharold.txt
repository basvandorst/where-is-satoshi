Yeah. agree. made mistake of buying ethereum with Bitcoin. had 3 ethereum sold 2 and put back in to bi coin, Fiat equivalent value up but bit coin down...
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:07:47
didn't pay much for it anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:53:16
Thankyou. I am trying to get my head around if bit coin emerges as the go to currency, 21M coins divided by world population isn't very much per person. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:02:48
does that mean 'b prime' thats how I read in my head. I understand its a different b. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:07:27
Im happy for my bit coin to valued at whatever they think its valued at, so long as it's usable. Im not trying to make a large amount of Fiat from it.

If you ever visit england you can stay at mine and Il be the first to take cryptos for B and B in the area. Il give you mega deal. like air b and b without the middle company. wallet to wallet for services... I also wont declare it as income as I will say its fun tokens and you are staying and playing the game of paying for things with fun tokens! ha ha 
seriously though  Lightning is gonna change a lot of things! excited about the technology, monetary gains is a welcome biprooduct of success!

I am more interested in long term, I'm not trying to play the markets or anything. I'm interested in the lighting network making bit coin the go to coin to use in the future.

it's in a round about way backed by threat of force and violence.
Not a sound way to back things tho.
and the answer nothing is perfect also.
Dollar bills have the words this note is legal tender for all debts public and private so refusal of it's use settling a debt in the USA legally voids any debt owed.
I believe these words are there so if you demand payment in gold from someone and refuse the paper you void your debt. 
and if you try and pay a debt to government not in (magic )legal dollar (paper) you could be jailed.
Taxes etc.
it's backed by nothing and fear and legal frameworks, all of which could tumble.

Traditionally Gold has always been a good, portable (to an extent) sound form of money.
it is a finite resource.
Bitcoin can act as gold because it is easy to store, hide, and it's value like gold is based on it's rarity.
it is also easily divisible, unlike shaving a gold bar, can be sent anywhere in the world quickly without the intervention or need for another party.
when you talk of investing only put in what you are willing to lose.
I like Bitcoin, I have more bitcoin than i have gold, If i was to cash out I'd have made more on Bitcoin and lost on gold at current prices.
I would recommend looking in to exactly what Bitcoin is and how it works, and the same for gold.
Compared to other so called cryptocurrencies I'd say either gold or BTC is the correct investment.
Also if you were to buy gold, would you hold it? or have someone or an institution hold it for you?
the same applies to BTC.
Reading about Bitcoin you will know the answer very quickly.

American Express hold money for months sometimes.
"do you take amex?' 
"why not I get benefits when I use it."
"who do you think pays for these benefits?"
Amex fees are a joke and most small places in the UK will take visa debit free charge a little for Credit cards and not even bother with American Express.

People use satoshis to buy things they want, outside of any other government issued currency, this appeals to other people and wealthy people want some so the value of the satoshi's increases, governments print more and more money and the value drops, more people want satoshis.

They won't tell us until they've bought up as many as they can as that would instantly make the perceived fiat value rocket. if the central banks slowly but surly buy up at OMG bitcoin has crashed levels it leaves less wild coins out there.
bitcoin inevitably becomes more sought after and the satoshi becomes equivelent to a dollar in price by which time the governments all go to the centrals and ask for paper fiat that runs off the back of bitcoins.
people who use satoshis are free to do so, the holders will become equivalent of billionaires and be welcomed in to the elite as long as they don't try and mess with the new bitcoin backed fiat.
Yachts bitches cars etc.

many people in the world aren't as privileged as you. Bitcoin can help people who don't have access to first world banking. (please don't read that as some sort of sjw rant on privilege  it is a word applicable to all of us used to banking in the west)

I would like to state what I think,  If cryptos are banned then they will have utility in the blackmarket still.
there will always be people willing to pay cash for it, to use it for shady things.
shady dealers who accept will maybe need fiat so surely a supply and demand thing emerges.
if on and off ramps are banned then the existing Bitcoin or crypto which isn't on exchanges goes up in value relative to the decrease in quantity.
Satoshis may become 1000/dollar or whatever and have a value regardless of whether governments ban them or not. 
they serve this purpose now.
I'd appreciate feedback and criticism on my thoughts. 
Many thank's
