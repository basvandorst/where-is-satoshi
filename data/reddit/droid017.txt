Your short attention span must have prevented you from getting to the part in my post where I stated that I have been using bitcoin for ~2 years now and have purchased it dozens of times. Yes transactions using btc are easy as dirt, but it shouldn't be such a burden to get my money into btc in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:56:22
You're right. I tried them earlier and the transaction was blocked by fucking Visa as fraudulent. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:06:35
Because I shouldn't have to? Thats a fucking absurd process and trying to tell any 'normal' person they should jump through hoops like that to use btc is going to make them immediately assume it's a bunch of BS. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:58:11
Man that was helpful, thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:16:03
Well that's a great way to grow the community. You must be a hit at parties.

Why do you keep saying "your bank"? My bank is not involved in any step of this. Buying btc for cash at 90% of exchanges involves making a deposit at a bank predetermined by the exchange, which is not open til Monday. Which I guess is the banks fault, but my point is that it is ridiculous that I would have to go, in person, to a bank, and deposit cash, to get btc. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:19:14
Indeed I am. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:42:59
We can only hope.

I'm sure coinbase could accept my visa-backed debit card or my Mastercard if they put a bit of effort into it. It's not my bank or Visa putting up roadblocks, it's that no one has put in the effort to make this a feasible option which is a bit absurd. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:16:26
What? I don't make the deposit at my bank, I make it at the bank of choosing by the btc exchange, all of which are not open on weekends. It's ridiculous that I should have to wait until 'business hours' to buy online anonymous currency.

Hey, OP is here so you don't have to talk like I'm not. I'd be happy to have a realistic conversation with you as I am a big btc supporter and have been using it for ~2 years. I guess I just thought by now I would be able to convert real money into bitcoin at a time besides 9-5 m-f. Yes, we would all love circle to be in full swing but I've been on the waiting list for ~4 months.
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:20:35
Well thanks for the info!
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:57:45
ahahaha my ignorance levels? VC funding doesn't do shit for me right now. I've been on the waiting list for circle for months, I guess the pace of technology just isn't on par with what I would like. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:58:30
Yes, I could try to meet with the only person in my town who sells on localbitcoin. My point is that I should be able to buy internet currency, on the internet, easily. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:11:16
Nope, genuinely didn't know that, but thanks for educating me in a non-douchey way. If you keep that up, soon everyone will feel welcome in the btc community! 
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:13:53
Yeah except "instant" means 36 hours from now when banks are open.
@_date: 2014-07-21 13:56:15
With all that incredible internet advice you're giving out maybe you should become a motivational speaker.

Why do people take my debit card for goods they ship to me? It's not like they can get those back either. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:07:39
I like this. Thank you for providing a solution to my problem and not berating me for my dissatisfaction with the current options. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:05:18
Well coin.mx gets blocked on my card as fraudulent (I guess that's Visa's fault but I think coin.mx should be partly to blame), and yeah, let me just go join circle right now. I've been on their waiting list for ~4 months.

It doesn't matter if you have a higher chance of becoming an addict or not. If people were actually educated on the effects and dangers of addiction to heroin and meth, do you think people would be chomping at the bit to try them and get addicted? And even then, who are you to say I shouldn't be allowed to take that chance with my own life? Protecting people from themselves is shitty fucking logic for weak minds who can't stand the idea of people doing something they disapprove of. Not only that, but in a decriminalized state we could spend the billions of dollars we currently spend on ineffective prohibition on rehabilitation and treat addiction properly, like a disease. Addicted people don't want to be addicted, so if we treated them like people who were sick instead of criminals to be punished and profited on, they would get better a lot more frequently. The stats from countries that have tried this have proven it.

How does being tied to a physical address matter in the least? Is Amazon going to come to my house to retrieve their goods if I reverse payment on them? Are they going to send the police to my house? My wallet is also tied to my identity on most exchanges, I can still reverse payment and the vendor still knows who I am but can't do anything about it. Please inform my ignorant self about how this is different.

If you're interested in the Twitter story a great book called Hatching Twitter goes way back to the early days. Dorsey is a borderline anarchist at heart lol.

If you read anything about his ideals or life pre-silk road you would know that money was a secondary motivator to Ross.

Do you meet the clients? Are they as sad and pathetic as I would imagine, like Dan Bilzerian?
