K well as someone who actually lives in Japan, they have a phenomenal conviction rate because they coerce confessions.  Like... Coerce coerce.  The judicial system here is quite aggressive, and more focused on closing a case and keeping those numbers up than on ensuring the correct individual goes into the slammer.

Right, it is a restating of the obvious but I brought it up because there's always so much hand-waving about the chief evil of the deepweb being its anonymous BTC drug trade, when if you're actually concerned about drug trading/trafficking then you've got bigger fish to fry.
