Glad to hear! I would love to if it would be of any use XD. I usually explain stuff as I go along so I have little mini-diagrams floating around because the person I was explaining it to didn't know about Public and Private keys or Hash functions so I had that scribbled on the side somewhere.

Yep, you got it!

Thanks! I think I got the formula wrong. It's supposed to be y^2 = x^3 + ax + b but I wasn't trying to focus too hard on it. Just the "basics", as I saw fit.

That's a great idea, because when I was explaining I was kept getting "your money" and "my money" mixed up while I was explaining the transactions.

I was worried it would be bad practice or make me look too needy. I'm still in high school so I'm always trying to look for some opportunity to earn some BTC! Thanks for remind me.

Haha, I had to do it over the period of an hour for the person in specific but it was well worth the time. But the time I finished we were talking about zk-SNARKS and the whole trusted setup problem.

Now that's some pretty awesome news

I think it might just be you. I can access it without a problem.

I'm curious as to why Circle would freeze your account. Was it random or did they give you an early warning?

I feel like if the stores/chains that sold daily consumer goods (grocery markets, basic necessities like toilet paper, etc.) began to support it there would be some considerable traction in terms of acceptance. At the very least, it would raise some interest in Bitcoin.

Speaking of Auroracoin, what happened to it? Last time I heard it flopped, with multiple block chain forks and was nearly worthless

Thanks for the answer!

Just to clarify, do you want to buy bitcoin from someone in the community or do you want to give bitcoins? 
@_date: 2016-10-30 14:49:44
Phooey, it was just too good to be true.

Does it increase safety in terms of anonymity? I understand the disadvantage with the fees but I'm just curious.
@_date: 2016-10-30 00:37:32
That's a pretty interesting method. Just out of curiosity, how much do fees take out of the original sum when you're doing this and do you have a preference for certain Altcoins, or just whatever has good liquidity?
