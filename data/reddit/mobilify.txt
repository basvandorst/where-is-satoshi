Google "To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty". It's a meme that turned into a copypasta and it gets edited in tons of contexts.

You dont need to use an ATM, buy btc anywhere and send it to the public key on the paper

@_date: 2017-11-22 20:43:43
Well, what can it be then? He sent me the link, and it leads to the original site. No big i's for L's or anything
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:37:41
Yeah, at home, but I also have a backup link om email, would restoring on this pc from that link interfere with the wallet on the pc it currently is at?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:51:02
wut? i didnt say that
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:41
Just download a wallet, press recieve btc in the wallet and paste that btc address in the send section of blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:05
until they burn it down
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:04:44
Well, im convinced. Bye BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:44:30
Thanks fella

First of all, he doesnt use reddit. And second of all, he set up 2fa before buying, he was about to send the btc to his wallet after having it for about an hour in blockchain when he noticed it was gone
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:53:24
Not a bad return though
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:42:06
But they will just stick with the banks, so what’s your point here
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:33:22
This is good for bitcoin
