Hope the same ) But you can use changelly without providing personal info - there is email login with no verification required.

I was using both ShapeShift and Changelly. When passing login on changelly a simply used fake email to continue. ;)

I rarely use sourceforge so I don't really know about that
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:18:11
This isn't a good comparison.

Yes, that's a good question - where it will be situated. I wonder to see how popular it will be in London? Maybe if this pilot version will be popular we'll see it in other cities.

Really good post! I was thinking I was the only one who feels the same way.

I think it is  absurd to believe to newsweek as they can't improve their article. Mass media is not credible

hm that's cool! one more reason to go to Australia

Well no risks - no rewards. Still if you are lucky you'll get a lot of money otherwise it will be your experience!

Is it true that anyone who spend from an address with 0-conf are liable to get their transactions duped because of the spammers?
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:36:04
How is it possible? I can't understand it. Can you describe me the stealing scam as simple as possible.

These guys looks like they need support and a cup of hot coffee. To bring them a coffee also a support .

Am I the only one who doesn't think it is funny? And curios as Somethinghere1  what the point to do this?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:57:14
Seriously ? The moderators delete the posts cause they don't want prices to fall down ?

Nice to hear that you are a volunteer and that you are keen on using btc
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:33:53
Can't agree that it is the same thing! 
Tulips are easy to make, Bitcoins are not! 
I can only agree with the comment that this article is really worthless to read ! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:02:29
me too! Blockchain is the best site. I think every member of our community must be thankful to this service
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:40:10
I am also curios about this situation. I know that Apple got rid of all appcoins in appstore and can't get why they did it. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:25:32
Wow! Good to see BTC is going to the crowd. Was it good coffee? Wanna try it just to use bitcoin

Moms never advise bad thigs for her son!
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:39:10
Could there be a bad implementation? 
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:40:58
Speaking from experience? :)

I agree that Reddit is much better, but twitter is a huge social media which is used by millions of people and this resource is important for crypto projects, so why twitter do that??

I hope Ross's mother won't take any serious steps, e.g. killing somebody...
