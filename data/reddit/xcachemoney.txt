468$ ~

Thank you. What if I have one wallet, labeled A. I say use a faucet.
I have all payments go out to that addy. One payment goes by, the HD function changes my addy A to Addy B, a new random one.
Next day, another payment goes through to addy A. Will that show up on my account?
That is what I am concerned with.
I don't use faucets, just a example.
If you could help, much appreciated :)

Lovely ponzis/hyips, desperately trying to get a satoshi or two.

 This is the email address who sent out the email. It's  , not a legit domain for blockchain.info. Watch out guys.

Circle works well as an exchange, but [blockchain.info]( is a great one. As well as any downloadable ones, or if you use bitaddress.org or other make-your-own-address sites where you yourself has the private key.

Worthless fiat. *laughs in bitcoin*
@_date: 2016-12-25 17:21:11
They "got" 1 BTC, worth 950$. bit larger scale now ;)

.1(10 minutes) x 6 = 1 hour = .6 BTC.
Working 8 hours a day, and usually 2,087 hours worked avg annually in USA. Here we go.
2,087 x .6 (hour) = 1252.2 BTC avg per year, using that code 9-5, which equates to 965k USD per year. 
Brb, about to pay for these siick 'bitcoin hacks.'

No such thing as a bitcoin balance in Circle.
I add 50$, it shows up, I send 50$ to a friend via address, he gets 50$ in bitcoin.
He sends me via circle 50$ in bitcoin, I can send to another friend USD.
edit: I'm pretty sure.
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:12:38
I recommend circle.com

Did some research via terms of service. (who does that?!)
Not to prove you wrong, but to factcheck my post/check for common knowledge anyways.
It says that when you receive bitcoin, it converts into whatever currency you have set. When you send it, it converts said currency, (if sending to a bitcoin address), to the correct amount of bitcoin at current exchange rate. 
Pretty sure that;s what it said :)

paxful.com is a very useful, fast site. Traded a visa card and an amazon card. instant. Also, purse.io for Amazon.com cards.

Depends on what you are interested in paying with.
Coinbase's lowest purchase amount is 1USD.
However if you are looking at buying with cash, LocalBitcoins or finding people in your area so you can trade cash for bitcoin.

Here's a quick album of me going through the steps. :) hope it helps.
If that doesn't work, and you don't have the tab, could be based on where you live. maybe :P
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:55:57
Yeah, I know. If I couldn't get some good talking points on here, I am going to stop. Thanks for that point.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:56:13
Wasn't that bad, was it?

steam profile here : 
I play CSGO daily, about it :)
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:04:28
It did take at least 10-15 minutes for the payment to get out of pending and into my Steam Balance. Only annoyance out of the whole process, besides providing every single data of my life, pardon SSN and bank account to them.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:56:30
haha. too volatile for me to put more than 5$ in haha
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:05:38
Yeah, took me a good 10-15 minutes for the payment to fully go through from pending to avail. Steam balance.

Made this for some people on my last thread who couldn't find how to add bitcoin to steam wallet.
I do not know that if you live outside the US, you may not have this option, but I think you should, logically, and it would make sense for you to, as Bitcoin is an anonymous currency that doesn't require a person or persons to be residing in any place, only requirement of bitcoin is that you can access the internet/have electricity. If this is wrong, and you can't use Bitcoin for steam because you live somewhere else, please alert me to that, so I can edit this.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:00:56
Thank you :)
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:00:17
Kinda of agree. If the money is sent, there's no reason for the extra information.
The only reason one should need all that information is so if you chargeback, in where you can't with bitcoin, they could report you to someone or something about that, whether it be govt. or service provider or something.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:06:19
Could be I haven't put over 100$ into the Steam thing, well, into the Add Funds part at least.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:08:01
A thing it could be as well, along with all the awesome replies as to why it took me 10-15 minutes pending, is that I sent it directly as a withdraw from Poloniex, so maybe their fee was off?
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:40:12
no problem man :)
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:09:02
:( apologies. sorry for offending Grammar Police. Will triple-check my titles next time :P

@_date: 2016-07-13 20:06:33
Was it the first one? would make sense.
@_date: 2016-07-13 20:02:47
With almost now a thousand hours on it, and no illegitimacy problems, multiple PayPal and credit card payments, I don't get why that would happen, if you have at least the payment sent through. Not like you can withdraw your bitcoin payment or anything.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:57:00
yup :) now I don't have to resort to PayPal in order to get skins and games. Go Bitcoin!

Username definitely checks out. +1.
