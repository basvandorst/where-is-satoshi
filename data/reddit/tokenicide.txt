Deja vu. I just got off of gab.ai and thought I had hit “go back“ by accident…

Trying to get YouTube to change their decision is a waste of time. If you don’t like what they did stop using it and use something else. Plenty of other video hosting platforms out there. That’s what competition is all about. And Merry Christmas everyone.

You're right. Better to respect the far more privileged body-hair lacking guys who owe their fortune to the guy who they tried to f*ck over. Brilliant.

You are correct. He did not go to jail specifically for getting Bitcoin for the Winklevii. He went to jail for bypassing KYC rules. Which as I recall is the exact same thing he did for the Winklevii (otherwise why would they need him to get it for them?) Unless I am mistaken.

F*ck. I wish I was Charlie. But thanks anyway. ;)

For those of us who don’t live in NC can you please tell us what law you’re referring to? Thanks.

Best MSM coverage of Bitcoin I’ve ever seen. When you consider the fact that another segment was about a $230 billion money laundering operation that involved ***no cryptocurrency at all***—just banks—it makes me think there’s at least one major Bitcoin fan working at ⁦CBS News.
Significant h/t to CBS News.
