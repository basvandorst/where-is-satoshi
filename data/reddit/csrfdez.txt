Well, it says that you are currently connected to 3 peers. But where you connected to 3 peers at the moment you hit Send for your transaction? Maybe you were just connected to 1 peer at that moment...
Always keep a backup of your wallet. I don't think that you have lost your bitcoins. There is an option that says 'reset blockchain and transactions' that you should use and wait for synchronization again. 
If the wallet is not corrupted you haven't lost your bitcoins, you'll just have to try again with more peers, and wait until your transaction gets inside a block.

The Coinbase debit card is great for Bitcoin. It is one way to keep the bitcoins moving and bringing awareness to merchants. 
Moreover, the debit in the card is kept in bitcoins. If Coinbase achieved 200.000 users with an average balance for each user of 200 USD at any given time, that would mean, at current prices (400 USD per bitcoin), that 100.000 bitcoins are locked and not available for trade on exchanges, which would mean the price of Bitcoin would go upwards, which would increase adoption, which would increase the price, etc in a virtuous circle. 
This is especially true if people really use the card for purchases on a daily basis, because in that case, those bitcoins are "healthily locked", ready to be spent, which, in the end, it is what bitcoins are for.

Most likely, that is because you sent your transaction to only one peer and that peer didn't relay it to the network.

Yes, you can. Definitely. Without even touching the blockchain.
You can pay to any other address in Lightning.  **It gets routed via the address you opened the channel with**, but you can pay to any other Bitcoin address (and you can receive from any other Bitcoin address) who has opened a channel in Lightning.

I consider the on-chain scaling proposition of BU as a dead-end. After a few months, off-chain Lightning will emerge as the best solution overall, so if the economic majority sticks to Bitcoin, the BU branch will eventually fade away by the rigidness of a bloated blockchain, higher fees and slower transactions: Bitcoin prevails, 21 million.
The best solution is definitely off-chain scaling with Lightning and keeping the current Bitcoin blockchain, but we can't keep on hitting an impasse indefinitely waiting for scaling to magically solve itself.

IMHO it doesn't make much sense to change one word at a time if you are using a 24 word BIP39 seed. The last word is part of the checksum.

That is why I say, among other reasons, that the 20 million new Lightning users per month is a hard-maximum, and that the real figure would be considerably less.

I am not talking about putting all transactions on-chain. I advocate for Lightning and Segwit, the sooner the better. Segwit solves malleability and very much facilitates the proper work of Lightning. 


I don't now if I understand you correctly. Each user would open one single Lightning channel. He can make a huge number of payments to many other Bitcoin addresses and at the same time he can receive payments from any other address, all in just one channel: many thousands of irrevocable off-chain Bitcoin transactions with just one on-chain transaction for that user.

As specified in section "From mnemonic to seed", here:
BIP39 uses PBKDF2, with HMAC-SHA512 as the pseudo-random function. The length of the derived key is 512 bits.
So, if the passphrase you choose is really random, I suppose it would also add additional entropy to the seed. However, I would not rely on the passphrase to generate more entropy. Stick to the length of the mnemonic, rely on a true random generator to generate that mnemonic, and evaluate the final entropy of your seed on the length of mnemonic based on this table:
|  ENT  | CS | ENT+CS |  MS  |
|  128  |  4 |   132  |  12  |
|  160  |  5 |   165  |  15  |
|  192  |  6 |   198  |  18  |
|  224  |  7 |   231  |  21  |
|  256  |  8 |   264  |  24  |
where MS is the length of the mnemonic sentence and ENT is the entropy in bits.

Off-chain transactions will happen, that is a fact, and it is inevitable. It is cheaper, faster, much more scalable than on-chain and it is not possible to record all worldwide coffee sales on the blockchain.
There is the common misunderstanding that off-chain transactions reduce the income of miners. The truth is that off-chain transactions with Lightning and Segwit WILL INCREASE INCOME BY MINERS. You could ask, how is that possible? Because Bitcoin at the core level is ultimately protected by miners, and the more valuable the network (as with Lightning and Segwit), the more protection is needed, so the income by mining fees will also be higher.

People will still associate Bitcoin to Core. Two months after BU miners dedicate their hashing power to their branch, Segwit and Lightning will start running on Bitcoin, fees will get dramatically cheaper, scalability will increase enormously and very quickly, and the very functioning of Lightning nodes that need additional bitcoins to create channels will drive the price eventually higher.
I feel on-chain scaling as stated by BU will not work. Most transactions must be off-chain as stated by Lightning if we want a true global network. BU miners will come back to Core-Lightning when they realize of this. The economic majority will stick to the original chain, so we are back at 21 million...

Did you send your last transaction from the Blockchain.info wallet? It is weird that txid fbdee7814cdb645dbf236dab282d9b2db94580ebfb55dafc471cb5262c9c347a is only showing up in blockchain.info explorer, and it is not showing up in other explorers and I can't find it in the mempool either. It seems it has not been broadcast properly.
Because it seems your last transaction is not in the mempool, and the fee for your first transaction is a bit lower than expected, it could really take a while. I can't say how much.


It depends on miners. Some miners completely ignore doublespends, so they may definitely take longer to confirm, or not confirm at all because it is the first transaction the one that makes it in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:48:43

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:34:08
If I were you and I were not in a rush, I would wait and see if the first transaction gets confirmed. 
Typically, transactions are removed from the mempool after 72 hours, so you can just broadcast again after that time without the fear of being notified about double-spending.
@_date: 2017-02-17 18:59:04
So you are stating that even if a small percentage of the already opened Lightning channels get closed, then eventually the total number of active Lightning users will plateau at a specific level. It could be a few million or a few billion users, depending on the proportion and frequency of channels being closed. I agree with that.
I believe many or most channels will hardly ever get closed, but I suppose it is difficult to say for sure until we see it in real life.
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:00:07


There is always a price where the risk taken is worth it. Nodes will have to evaluate the risk to calculate the acceptable fee. 
Anyway, Lightning fees will always be much lower than on-chain fees. Unlike on-chain transactions, Lightning tx will be nearly instant. Sounds more than good to me.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:22:34
You can rebroadcast whichever transaction you want. The first one will most likely still not confirm because of low fees, so the second one is best. 
To definitely know if a transaction is no longer in the mempool you need to run these commands on a 24/7 running full node:
getmempoolentry 107bfa83930881e1d89e8b4f7dc47f580ec055dcea08344b2f4770d542910aac
getmempoolentry fbdee7814cdb645dbf236dab282d9b2db94580ebfb55dafc471cb5262c9c347a
However, I suppose that if you visit 
 and 
 and there is no trace of any of those txids, then the transactions have not confirmed and they are no longer in the mempool. I just imagine the blockchain.info explorer may work like that...
By default, transactions are removed from the mempool after 72 hours if they haven't been confirmed. However, keep in mind that the raw transactions have already been broadcast and any miner could potentially register it on the blockchain even months or years later. If you want to avoid this contingency, you must spend the only input which is common to both txids and which belongs to address 14mH7CvX7g3VB7ugW3dS3g6SeBXo42xe1P , and which is precisely the one that raised the double-spend notification. 
If it wasn't for the double-spend and if you had a reasonable change going back to your wallet, you could have accelerated the confirmation by using "Child Pays For Parent". It doesn't apply to this situation, though.
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:50:42
It is not about private keys, it is about Lightning channel outputs being spent. 
You first have to wait for the Lightning channel to be confirmed on the blockchain (blocks will be continuously broadcast from Earth to Mars). After that, you connect to the Lightning node for that output in the channel. There will typically only be one Lightning node for that channel, so it will be either on Mars or on Earth. 
That is how Lightning can provide, among users on Mars and among users on Earth, with instant off-chain irreversible Bitcoin transactions .

I don't want Bitcoin to be legalized as legal tender, and I don't expect it to be, either. Normally, with some exceptions, legal tender means it can't be refused to extinguish debts. It is a privilege given by governments to their own created currency.
I want Bitcoin to be voluntary. I only expect not to be made illegal.


I am of the opinion that what you are saying is not guaranteed to succeed. I also believe it doesn't apply that much to Bitcoin. It is getting more distributed as the time goes by.


The maximum number of mined bitcoins will be 21 million. It is defined by the protocol, not by its users.


As Bitcoin use keeps spreading and it is more evenly distributed, the risk of crippling the economy by interested parties is less likely. However, you don't need Bitcoin for that. A group of billionaires can collide against countries, and even the last 8 years of QE by central banks can be interpreted as competitive devaluation, forcing other countries to devalue further in retaliation.


As I said, Bitcoin resembles commodity money. Many of the flaws and virtues you see in gold, also apply to Bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin will rise if it succeeds becoming the internet of value.


In a Bitcoin world I imagine governments acting on their economy with fiscal policies (more or less taxes, more or less government spending), not with monetary policies.

Yes, that's right. For payments to be instant, they must all be routed inside the same planet.

First, a private key is created. From the private key, you derive a public key. From the public key, you derive the Bitcoin address.
Bitaddress.org generates entropy when you randomly move your mouse around the screen and when you randomly type from your keyboard.

How do you know they don't own some bitcoin? Lots of VC in Silicon Valley and many well-known individuals in finance, politics and business are backing Bitcoin directly or indirectly.


You don't need to download any stuff to use a wallet. Moreover, Lightning will bring instant transactions to Bitcoin. 


Would you say that Columbus and the conquistadors crashed the market when they brought huge amounts of gold in the 15th-16th century? Maybe. Those are just part of the growing pains. Despite the ups and downs, Bitcoin is getting more stable, but it still acts like a limited-supply commodity, not like a single printer with potentially unlimited amount of paper. Don't get too blinded by the apparent stability and fairness of the centrally-controlled fiat system.


Most of gold reserves are currently owned by extremely few participants: countries and central banks. I have no idea how Bitcoin is distributed, but I would say it is getting more and more distributed very quickly. On the other hand, the few owners of the printer in the fiat system own an unlimited printing-power.

Imagine the future: Bitcoin achieves massive success. All payments, forex, stocks trading, ticketing for events, etc is performed on the Bitcoin network. Most transactions are off-chain because they are instant, nearly free and it scales perfectly. How much would that network be worth? It would be in the hundreds of billions of US dollars.
Even if 99,99% of transactions are off-chain and don't generate mining fees, the remaining 0,01% of on-chain transactions would have to create mining fees to guarantee the protection against attacks that could destruct the multi-billion network. How much is that in mining fees? Billions in mining fees a year.
So, as a summary: Off-chain transactions are inevitable. Off-chain transactions (Lightning and Segwit) make Bitcoin more valuable. The more Bitcoin is valuable, the more miners will receive on mining fees. That is how it works!

BU is objectively a bad technical implementation. It would give lots of problems in the long run.
On top of that, BU requires human input to calculate the final block size limit, which seems like a no-go for a system that self sustains on simple automated incentives.
Particularly, BU proposes a hard-fork to deal with the block size limit. Moreover, they will need to hard-fork AGAIN if they want to solve malleability, or otherwise, add Segwit to their code. If they choose Segwit, they will need to write it from scratch from the Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 codebase which BU is currently using. Until malleability is solved, off-chain scalability is a big pain, so the BU proposal may put Bitcoin in limbo for years to come before any significant scaling is put forward.
I am not inside the mind of those supporting BU, so I can't say what their intentions are. I just cannot find any sensible answer that could justify how BU could help Bitcoin in any way.

Nothing is free in this world; just very low fees. Zero risk of losing your bitcoins if you keep you private key safe.


If you want to pay to any address, you need to have a positive balance on your side on the Lightning channel. If you want to receive from any address, you need to have a positive balance on the address you opened your channel with. That's all.

Public keys are 33 bytes long. A Bitcoin address is a special encoding of a hash of the public key. Bitcoin addresses start with 1 or 3.


The length of a private key is 32 bytes, i.e. 256 bits. The number 2²⁵⁶ (approx. the number of valid combinations for private keys) is huge. It is nearly impossible to create the same private key if they are generated truly randomly.


You can easily go from private key to public key, but it is impossible to go from public key to private key.


Bitaddress.org does not check if an address has been used nor does it allow spending from a private key. If you want to spend from a private key, you need a Bitcoin wallet. The wallet will check if there are any bitcoins on that address by querying the blockchain.

Segwit is currently the only way of solving malleability and quadratic hashing. As implemented in Bitcoin Core, It is a backwards-compatible solution. 
If, for whatever reason, you want to make it backwards-incompatible, you would also need to port Segwit code. 
Is anybody working on Segwit as a backwards-incompatible solution? No.
Does anybody know of a better way to solve malleability and quadratic hashing? No, nobody knows of a better solution than Segwit.
Then, what are we waiting for to be activated now? This blockade is just so negligent.

Because you are just importing bootstrap.dat in an "isolated" environment (no need of network), I can only think of too few resources (memory too low, disk nearly full). 
If you have previously used your wallet.dat a lot (lots of used addresses) it may also affect if you are already low on memory or CPU. Maybe you can try to move your wallet.dat to a different folder before you start the import.

If you have 17 active connections, then you are connecting to 8 nodes (outgoing connections) and 9 nodes are connecting to you (incoming connections).
Blockchain.info does not connect to every node (currently approx. 6400 nodes) because he doesn't need to. It would be too resource intensive receiving every block 6400 times and all transactions 6400 times. 
It is considered that connecting to 8 nodes is safe against sybil attacks. Even if only one of those 8 nodes is honest then you will be receiving the correct history and at the same time you would be able to automatically discard the 7 dishonest nodes. Blockchain.info is extremely conservative by connecting to 117 nodes there.

It is a misconception that BTC will lose 50% of the hashrate. 
I believe that activating Segwit now is a much better solution than BU. This will show up in the price. The hash power is directly related to the price of the native token. So my prediction is that BTC will keep the hash power and it will be BTU the one which will see a steep drop in the hash power a few weeks later.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:07:22
OK. Write down the seed on a piece of paper. Keep it safe.

Is this for real? Adapting the protocol to solve malleability with Segwit and making the protocol extensible is discarded by Jihan as complicated. At the same time he is pushing the non viable emergent consensus patch which is broken from the very roots of its design. 
Does Jihan really not understand that solving malleability is an absolute must for Bitcoin to move forward? Can't he really not grasp that if malleability is not fixed lots of us developers are stuck and can not deliver better applications? This blockade of the malleability fix is costing developers and companies a lot of money.

It is not the amount that is important, but the size of the transaction. Most wallets automatically do an estimate of the fee necessary for your transaction to go through.
If you want to know current rates: 
You can also call the estimatefee on Bitcoin Core to get the current fee rates. Currently, 148 satoshis/byte to get confirmed in the first 6 blocks and 135 satoshis/byte to get confirmed in the next 24 blocks.

You can vote with 99% of the hash rate that your are willing to hard-fork to your Unlimited version of the software. As soon as you hard-fork, if users feel your Unlimited hard-fork is worthless, its price will drop heavily and the hash rate of your hard-forked version will likewise drop too. The Unlimited hard-fork could easily get stuck if it is perceived as worthless.
On the other hand, if the original Bitcoin chain is viewed as the best, you will see the price of Bitcoin go farther up, perhaps even higher than before the hard-fork. So, it doesn't matter if just at the beginning it only had 1% of the previous hash power. If users feel the original Bitcoin chain is more valuable (even better than before,  because Segwit is being activated, for example) its hash power could quickly even be much higher than before the hard-fork.

If you keep your port 8333 open, any other node can connect to you. There is no sure way of knowing when blockchain.info will connect to your node. It may be just random or it may depend on the response time of the nodes blockchain.info is connected to: if one node is too slow, it may try to connect to you. You can check the "Help / Debug window / Peers tab" to know who you are connected to and who is connected to you.
If you are accepting incoming connections (i.e. the number of connections in the bottom left side of Bitcoin Core is higher than 8), then you are already relaying the transactions you receive.

I see. It is a backwards-incompatible proposal. AFAIK it hasn't even been properly peer reviewed.
Moreover, I don't think there is any Lightning or second layer software using any of this, nor any wallet providers changing their code to deal with it either. They are definitely doing it for Segwit. 
Moving to that proposal would bring us at least two years back in the delivery of software and it wouldn't surprise me that a new "solution" comes by in the meantime, pushing the deadlock a couple of years farther.
There is real work being delivered based on Segwit (Lightning, wallets...) that just need Segwit being activated on mainnet to make the ecosystem move forward and grow.

How emergent consensus is broken:  
* Non-root design:  
  - EC chain can be wiped out if overtaken by main chain.  
* Root design:  
  - EC puts part of consensus directly in the hands of people (miners), so it no longer self sustains on simple automated incentives. Putting consensus directly in the hands of people (maximum block size not fully automated) would raise politics (and the ensuing corruption) to a new level .   
  - It is no longer possible by default to accept transactions with a few confirmations (maybe less than five?) because by design the max block size negotiation may create one/many chains with orphan blocks.
More info, here:  
However, my post is not about why EC is broken. It is about finding hard to believe how anyone who purportedly cares about Bitcoin is blockading the activation of Segwit, and how this reckless stand is suffocating innovation and costing developers and companies lots of money.

Segwit is definitely good for everybody, including miners. Segwit allows Lightning to run smoothly. The new Lightning functionality would drive the Bitcoin price up.
Moreover, Lightning is very deflationary. Bitcoins need to be stored on channels. It is the way to get irreversible instant transactions. This will increase the price of Bitcoins, which will consequently increase the revenue for miners.

Then go to the Inputs tab and remove the inputs you don't want to spend.
Finally, if you have the private keys of all inputs, you will be able to sign the transaction.

Lightning is good for both miners and users. Users will get inexpensive transactions; miners will get more revenue.

I would say Segwit is definitely good for miners, even in the short term. The revenues in fees per block is currently around 15% of the block reward (12.5 BTC).

It is explained on section 9, Risks, of the Lightning paper:


when using the Lightning Network. If a malicious participant creates many
channels and forces them all to expire at once, these may overwhelm block
data capacity, forcing expiration and broadcast to the blockchain. The result would be mass spam on the bitcoin network. The spam may delay
transactions to the point where other locktimed transactions become valid.
This may be mitigated by permitting one transaction replacement on
all pending transactions. Anti-spam can be used by permitting only one
transaction replacement of a higher sequence number by the inverse of an
even or odd number. For example, if an odd sequence number was broadcast, permit a replacement to a higher even number only once. Transactions
would use the sequence number in an orderly way to replace other trans-
actions. This mitigates the risk assuming honest miners. This attack is
extremely high risk, as incorrect broadcast of Commitment Transactions
entail a full penalty of all funds in the channel.
Having said that, anyone who cares about Bitcoin and who is not backing Segwit now is just acting irresponsibly. That kind of reckless behavior can only be explained on someone who does not properly understand Segwit.

That is a misconception. 
Segwit and LN adds value to Bitcoin, which raises the price, which benefits miners. Moreover, the security of the network is sustained by mining power, no matter how many off-chain transactions.
So it all sums up to the fact: Segwit and LN make Bitcoin more valuable. The more valuable the network, the more it is important to have it protected. The more it is important to have it protected, the more revenue for miners.

Segwit allows more transactions per block. So if a bigger block in a hard fork brings more revenue to miners, then segwit will necessarily also bring more revenue to miners. Users don't think in terms of what is the maximum size of the block, they think in terms of how much will this transaction cost me. If I, as a user, am willing to pay 50.000 satoshis in fees per transaction and with segwit I am able to double the number of transactions with that fee, then miners will definitely profit from that. What is wrong with my reasoning?
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:08:27
I agree on most of what you propose. However, 250 GB may be on the low end of what is required for long term use. The blockchain is growing at a rate of 50 GB/year. With 250GB HD you would run out of free space in two years.

No vanity gen. Just free text on the address and adding the last four checksum bytes appropriately to make it valid. Nobody owns the private keys of those addresses, so they are unspendable and a gift to all bitcoiners. 
It is shocking it is the only transaction in the block though.

Transactions on the Lightning Network most of the time don't even touch the blockchain but they are true irreversible instant Bitcoin transactions with nearly no fees.
Lightning is 2nd layer, needs Bitcoin protocol which is first layer.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:34:05
Transactions are valid and irreversible immediately without touching the blockchain. It is only mandatory to broadcast to the Bitcoin network if any of the parties tries to broadcast an older transaction to scam any other party.
Basically, Lightning transactions pay nearly no fees and are highly scalable. The associated "cost" is continuously monitoring the blockchain and reacting appropriately if anyone broadcast an older transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:19:15
OK. Make sure all your balance, which must be unconfirmed, is on 1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia . Go to Preferences / Fees and set the transaction fee to 1 milibitcoin / KB . I believe it is the maximum allowed by Multibit HD. Send any amount to one of your addresses in your wallet. That would accelerate the confirmation of the first transaction.
When you are finished, set back again to a lower fee on Preferences / Fees.

If it is a wallet.dat file from Bitcoin Core, just place it in the data directory, launch Bitcoin Core and run the following command:

It is not possible for rogue Lightning nodes to scam users or to collude with other nodes to keep user payments. 
Alice wants to buy something. She first needs to open a Lightning channel by creating a 2 of 2 multisig address on the blockchain. One private key is owned by Alice and the other key is owned by the Lightning node. At that time she has absolute control of her bitcoins. It doesn't matter if the Lightning node gets hacked or not. She has absolute control!
On the other side, Bob is selling stuff. He first also needs to open a Lightning channel by creating a 2 of 2 multisig address on the blockchain. One private key is owned by Bob and the other key is owned by the Lightning node. It doesn't matter if the Lightning node is a scammer or rogue or if it is hacked. Once the Lightning channel is created, Bob has absolute control of his bitcoins in that channel!
So now Alice wants to buy something from Bob. Alice contacts Bob, Bob gives her a RIPEMD160(SHA256) of a secret (a.k.a. the pre-image). Alice will only pay to whoever knows the pre-image, which is only Bob, so the payment is "pulled" immediately from Bob to Alice hopping all the way through the intermediate Lightning channels. There is no possibility of fraud. After the initial channel creation, Alice and Bob completely own their bitcoins without the need of further persistence on the blockchain.

Can Replace By Fee help solve this problem? Start with a low fee and keep it increasing over time until the transaction makes it into a block.
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:29:27
As I said, it is likely to appear again 72 hours after your first broadcast.
On the other hand, if you are using Bitcoin Core 0.12, youd don't want to wait and you know what you are doing (the concept of utxos used by your transaction), you can call the *abandontransaction* command and resend your transaction again with a higher fee. Only do this if you are using the same inputs, otherwise you may end up sending double the amount you intended in the first place.
EDIT: If your wallet has 0 BTC now, it is safe to use the *abandontransaction* command, send with a higher fee and leave your wallet depleted again. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:28:53
Where on the Lightning paper is the term IOU ever mentioned? There are no IOUs. There are real bitcoins on real Bitcoin channels exchanged off-line. 
If a hacker hacks the private key of a Lightning node, then bad luck for the Lightning node. No problem for Alice or for Bob in that situation if they keep their private keys safe.
There is section 9 on the Lightning Paper, called Risks, where the known risks are explained.

It seems fair to think that when segwit is accepted, blocks will be full again very quickly. In terms of miners revenue, it would be similar to a 1.8 MB increase in the maximum block size. 
I dissent with your skepticism on the net positive effect for miners after segwit. Miners will earn more fees overall because of the higher number of transactions registered, and the total reward per block in US dollars will also be higher because the market would reward the growth of additional functionality in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
So, IMHO in their own self-interest, miners should also support Segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:48:10
SegWit is more profitable for miners. It would bring an irreversible nearly-instant highly-scalable payments network with Lightning. This would drive the price up, so miners would earn much more. Keep in mind that the network is always protected by the work of miners. If the network is more valuable, miners would earn more.
I really find hard to understand why there are still people against SegWit. It is the right solution to solve most of the current limitations.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:01:51
Yes, just wait. It may take quite a while, though.
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:21:46
Segwit brings a whole lot of new features that would make the price go up significantly. That is definitely good not only for holders but also for miners. 
In fact, IMHO segwit is the way forward for Bitcoin to succeed. The sooner the better.

How did you broadcast the transaction? It seems like only blockchain.info knows about it.

That behavior is normal in most if not all of KYC/AML implementing exchanges.  If they found something on your profile, in your KYC survey answers, suspect transactions, or if you are under investigation, they would just stop communicating. It is a way of playing safe on their side.
They may also be overwhelmed by work or any other benign reason.

I believe you are really referring to "two-way" transactions, in the sense that you can send and receive payments simultaneously in the same channel. Irreversible two-way real Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-25 07:11:57
By default, as set in the *-mempoolexpiry* command line argument, the expiry of a transaction in the mempool triggers after 72 hours. It may not be totally reliable because it is possible for nodes to resend it and keep it in the mempool indefinitely.
Have a look after 72 hours of the first broadcast and resend the transaction with a higher fee.

You don't normally open a channel with the coffee shop. You will normally have a previously opened channel with a node. Then you pay to the Bitcoin address of the coffee shop through your channel. Your payment finds the route to the coffee shop by hopping through several different Lightning channels (in the same way as the routers in the internet work nowadays) and it is received nearly instantly by the coffee shop.

Any of the two parties of a Lightning channel can register the last transaction on the blockchain whenever they want.  There are two situations in which it makes most sense:
1. If one of the participants in the Lightning channel tries to cheat and registers an old transaction on the blockchain, the other participant can punish the cheater by registering a transaction that gives him all bitcoins in the channel.
2. If one of the participants in the Lightning channel wants to stop monitoring the blockchain for older cheating transactions, he can register the last valid transaction.
It may be counterintuitive. Be aware that Lightning transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. If you receive bitcoins on a Lightning transaction you can be sure that those bitcoins are yours. There is nothing anybody can do to take those bitcoins from you if you keep monitoring the blockchain and react appropriately if an older transaction is broadcast.
@_date: 2017-01-29 16:05:48

The transaction was correctly broadcast to the network. I just went here:
 and broadcast the raw transaction again on  just in case
The main problem is that the fee is a bit low: 38610 satoshis/KB. It should have been at least around 50000 satoshis/KB.
To solve this problem ASAP, make use of "Child Pays For Parent": I suppose this address 1DSonpg5Cvv4BnLe5ojasRbBAYasx3WVia is the change of the transaction and you control it. Try to spend that output to another address that you control with a fee of at least 100000 satoshis/KB to compensate for the low fee of your first transaction. That would confirm both transactions very quickly.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:00:42
SegWit fixes transaction malleability. You can have Lightning without Segwit, but it would be prone to attacks that would only be fixed with timeouts and the process would be much slower.
The beauty of Lightning with Segwit is having an irreversible nearly-instant highly-scalable payments network. There is lots of work being done on Lightning and Segwit by many developers around the world. It would really be sad if all that work is delayed or wasted.

It's difficult to understand your point if the proper Lightning vocabulary is not used. What is a "lightning signing key"? What is an "account"? Those terms are not used in the Lightning paper:
If Bob safely keeps his private key, he can't lose funds, nor can he be "defaulted" on, because Lightning transactions are real Bitcoin transactions exchanged off-chain.
It you could put a very specific and clear example I would happily look at it.

SegWit fixes transaction malleability and it allows Lightning, which brings instant transactions and extremely high capacity and scalability. So SegWit is much more than a 2 MB hard-fork.

Mining Bitcoin follows the same economical pattern as mining gold or producing any other commodity. If mining one bitcoin costs much less than its market price, new miners will arrive and compete with those already established. These new miners will raise the difficulty and the cost of producing bitcoin until its price is just above its cost of production.
In the end, in an ideal world, the "marginal cost of production" for one bitcoin amounts to its price. This equality applies to all commodity markets. It does not apply to government issued currencies, though.

I will be publishing the app at xparent.com in the near future. 
The Xparent application relies on the fact that public governments are decided to provide transparency to citizens. At least in Spain, that is what they say on TV all the time.
These are the requirements that an institution must fully comply with to be considered transparent as per the Xparent definition:
1) The public institution must provide a hierarchy of departments in a config.json file.
2) All payments must go from parent to children, from children to parent or to a Bitcoin address that is mapped to a provable well-known real life identity (typically, a service provider).
3) All spent transaction-outputs must belong to a single Bitcoin address and the change must return to that same address.
If the whole total budget starts at the root node of the hierarchy, and the three steps above are always honored, we the citizens would always be certain who the recipients of the money are and how much they are paid. If they don't comply, we may ask them for clarifications.
N.B.: There are other steps to follow to fix unintended well-meaning mistakes on payments, or external spamming of the addresses in the hierarchy, but that is further work for the future.

You may be thinking from a US or European point of view, but $0.05 per transaction is a considerable amount in many countries.
If Bitcoin usage goes 10 times higher, 0.05 cents will not enough. Moreover, the capacity of the Bitcoin network would be inelastic to adapt to the new situation, and fees could grow significantly. Even if now it seems like an improbable situation, some people might even look for more cost-effective alternatives. 
I believe we should go for the 8 MB blocks ASAP, but consensus by core developers is mandatory and the hard fork should be definitely added to Bitcoin Core.

Consider the fees as the way to protect the network when there is no fixed block subsidy (currently at 25 BTC per block).

It will eventually be confirmed, or it will be "forgotten" by the network and still stay in the source Bitcoin address. Keep in mind that nothing is really "forgotten". Even if not confirmed, someone may replay that transaction again even a few weeks later...
Normally it is quite safe to consider that when the transaction is removed from the mempool, i.e. when you don't see it again in  or  , the transaction is "forgotten", and you can try sending again with a higher fee.

This is because Multibit HD does not allow spending from unconfirmed transactions. You are trying to spend from an input that is already being spent in the still active transaction. You have to wait for that still active transaction to confirm before you send a new transaction.

@_date: 2017-04-08 19:04:53
That's right. Maybe the transaction first received in your wallet had no confirmations and was finally double-spent, so it didn't make it to your wallet. That is what it seems it may have happened in your image (in Swedish?): dubbel spendera.

It seems that you are not a developer and you are not aware of how an awful lot of work and what a real pain would be to code a minimum viable product without Segwit.

On the blockchain you can register the hash of any document or documents. That document can be whatever you want. That way, you can proof that a specific document existed at a specific time or earlier. For that purpose you use the OP_RETURN opcode.
On the other hand, P2SH outputs contain a hash that refer to executable code that are used to redeem bitcoins.

It is only safe to say that a transaction will not get confirmed when at least one of the inputs it is spending is confirmed in a different transaction.
It is "mostly" safe that a transaction will not confirm when it is removed from the mempool. By default, nodes maintain transactions in the mempool for 72 hours. If you don't want to check the mempool directly for yourself, you can query a Bitcoin explorer for your transaction id. If the explorer doesn't know about it, it is most likely it will not get confirmed.
However, keep in mind that once you have broadcast a transaction, it is known for everybody, so it can be replayed at a later time (maybe years after) and the fee may even be pumped by the receiver of the transaction by using Child Pays For Parent and finally get included in a block.

It is a compromise by developers and miners where both get what they wanted. 
Core devs get SegWit running as a soft fork in April 2016 as they were proposing all along, and miners acknowledge that the hard fork can happen in July 2017, as Core devs were also stating all along.
Miners can trigger the hard fork by mid-2016 as they were requesting all along, so they have the upper hand, but at they same time they agree with Core devs that it may be safer to wait to mid-2017.

That would only be true if all blocks were mined exactly every 10 minutes, as if it was a perfect 10 minutes alarm clock. 
However, Bitcoin follows a Poisson distribution and some blocks may be mined faster than others. That is why, on average, you have to wait 10 minutes to see the first mined block, regardless of the moment you sent your transactions. 
To further clarify: it doesn't matter if you have been waiting for two hours and you still have not seen a new mined block. On average, you will still have to wait 10 more minutes to see it.

Yes, the Fed can "destroy" the money it created by selling the assets it previously bought, which created the money in the monetary base in the first place.

The Bitcoin Core user interface does not reflect the download of blocks in real time. In my own experience, if you download the whole blockchain, the update of the user interface is much slower when you are downloading the last few weeks of the blockchain. It sometimes seems stuck because the CPU goes to nearly 100% as it is performing the validation of the whole chain since the genesis block.
It helps to see with your own eyes that the blocks are still being downloaded at a good rate. Check the debug.log file and find the UpdateTip text. It gets updated for every block downloaded. If you are in Linux, you can do the verification by executing this on the command line.
**cd ~/.bitcoin**

Not doing a hard fork delivers the message that Bitcoin doesn't fold against external pressure, whether governments, banks or any other. It delivers the message that consensus rules must be respected to have an immutable ledger and those consensus rules should only be changed when strictly necessary.
Moreover, a 2MB hard fork does not bring any appreciable scalability increase. Having said that, activating Segwit is essential. I wish we activate Segwit first and discussions about any maximum blocksize increase may be discussed later, but whatever is necessary to have Segwit on Bitcoin ASAP.

It depends on miners. 
If the destination address is yours (or if you had a change address, which is no the case here), the correct way of accelerating the transaction is using Child Pays For Parent, i.e. take the first unconfirmed transaction and concatenate to create a new transaction with a much higher fee to compensate for the low fee of the first transaction. Both transactions will get confirmed automatically.
