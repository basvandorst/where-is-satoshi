You know - people have been donating cash and checks to dubious charities for time immemorial... Some of which are outright scams and others that spend more money on administrative costs and fundraising than their actual egalitarian purpose. Seattle's YouthCare spent something like $30,000 on postage one year. There are whole websites dedicated to evaluating charities' spending.

In theory - there would be competition to verify transactions at the cheapest rate. That's different than a monopoly or duopoly like Visa and Mastercard setting the rate.

I actually have a bad impression of Coinbase. They require (or required) you to verify a credit card if you wanted to sell sooner than 5 days but their code was broken and couldn't associate my address with my card (despite every other e-commerce site being able to) and apparently the same thing happened to a lot of other people on this subreddit, too.
But these companies don't have to partner up with the government/FDIC to get insured....... My deposits into my credit union are insured by "American Share Insurance" which is independent of the US government. We - as consumers of exchanges - should demand that our deposits be insured and exchanges be audited by reputable CPA firms.

You buy bitcoins at a price in fiat or you can sell bitcoins at a price in fiat, and they will also hold your bitcoins or fiat like a wallet and even receive and send bitcoin transactions for you. They actually just go through Bitstamp (iirc) to actually exchange and they tack on extra fees, but they sell themselves as a service to actually store your bitcoins too which makes it even more imperative that they have audits!! Are you not familiar with the service?

You're all confusing fault with how much sympathy the victims should get....
This is Mt.Gox's fault. They sold themselves as a service that allows you to exchange bitcoins. They defrauded customers. Even the most rabid of libertarians believes in fairness and strong courts and that you can not commit fraud.
Now - everybody who conducted business with Mt.Gox would have known the risks and the very few avenues of recourse if the service fails. Nobody should be expecting the FDIC or the government to return their lost bitcoins, but they are still victims of fraud by circumstances not their fault.

Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin that you can move it around however you want, inexpensively?

The bug doesn't actually bother me.... It's just that this is something basic that nearly every other e-commerce site gets right. And this problem has been around awhile and emailing support got me a useless response from a desk.com agent over a month later. That doesn't give me confidence in their engineers. is right: "only bad code and security practices end up getting hacked."

Hell no, so I would expect to save 3% when paying in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:15:57
Haha - No I am not trolling but I don't understand what makes you think there's a distinction between a broker and an exchange when talking about losing your bitcoins......

Bitcoin, in my opinion, is the end-all of currency.... But Overstock.com isn't passing the benefits on to the consumer (so any consumer that isn't a rabid libertarian like us would not likely choose bitcoin over credit card). Yet everybody is stroking overstock's cock just because they pulled a P.R. stunt

Neither "bitcoin" nor "CRYPTO10OFF" seems to work.... I think that was a one day promotional thing
I was really asking a rhetorical question, though, to make a point that libertarians are getting excited about paying in bitcoin but not necessarily realizing that it's about saving money and not giving up our consumer power.

Why wouldn't we just go back to the U.S. dollar where the majority of voting U.S. citizens elect someone that appoints people to manage it?

It's important to know that if Coinbase (or kraken) were to be hacked or just goes out of business, you won't necessarily get your coins or fiat back from them either. Nobody - not the FDIC nor any private insurer - guarantees deposits into them.
If - say - Coinbase ends up in US bankruptcy court, you'll at least have your spot in line to get paid back and it will certainly be in front of the investors. But don't count on getting paid back. But yes, business with Coinbase is a lot less shady than BTC-e and probably about as good as it gets right now.

... and for those issues to be addressed, Us Libertarians need to demand that these merchants' fee savings get passed on to us
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:17:55
They probably are very secure... But there's no independent authority to verify their security and that's just stuff they tell you in their marketing spiel. Insurance on deposits is important to me.
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:15:13
Sure - but what about the merchants that won't do that/hang up the phone? Those are the merchants whose transactions we would be disputing to the bank/credit card company......
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:23:08
They have to.... Their financials are shit. They have to separate themselves from the pack, and bitcoins have the potential to earn them money
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:43:15
OK - if you want to make a pedantic point about what a bureaucratic paper pushing government agency should arbitrarily define them as, then yes, you are right.
But my point is that they take people's money (like BTC-e) and hold people's bitcoins. In fact, they advertise themselves as a service that can store your bitcoins! They have a marketing spiel about their cold storage security but nobody insures your deposits and nobody independent checks their security (afaik.) If they were to tank, they are just a bankrupt company in bankruptcy court and you are just in line to get your money back after their remaining assets are liquidated.

We don't get that when paying bitcoin to Overstock.com or any merchant that uses coinbase
