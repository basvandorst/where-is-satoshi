Someone replying to the same comment as you literally just did. I'm on mobile so I can't really link it, but it's RIGHT there

Calls me sensitive about him not following a naming convention in a thread where r/Bitcoin is bitching about Bitcoin.com calling BTC "Bitcoin Core". Wow.  
  
And when did I say BCH was "Bitcoin"? If you're gonna make up semantics that 'prove' you don't actually call BCH Bcash, then I would like you to show when I ever called BCH Bitcoin. Or are you just willingly stupid?  
  
Have fun paying several dollars in transaction fees for that bar tab.

Learn terminology. Inflation is increase in supply not a decrease in value.

The comment you made prior to this one literally has you calling it Bcash. Here, I'll even [link]( your own fucking comment for you. Is that too hard though? Maybe I should quote this shit so that you don't have to strain your hand to click the link  
  


  
If talking is so hard for you, maybe you should shorten "Bitcoin" down to "Bit".

Last I checked BCH didn't stand for Bcash. Your bias is showing.

[Oh look, proof. How weird.](  
  
Could you explain to me how Blockstream could operate without a plan to make money?

I'm [drowning]( in my [lack of proof.](

I spent $10 to send $15 because the QT wallet told me to. The last time I tried a custom fee (1% of total sent) my BTC ended up stuck for 72 hours while I waited for the network to forget my transaction, since no one would confirm it. I was scared that would happen again, so I did the recommended fee.
It isn't FUD - this is a legitimate problem. And if the solution is to ignore the official recommended fees, then you are also quite clearly saying that an important part of the QT wallet is broken and should not be used.
At best the wallet is broken, at worst the network is broken, by your own admission. How is any of this FUD?

The difference is that you have the name "Bitcoin", and they don't. That's why they continue to go after you guys. It isn't toxicity for the sake of toxicity - they are still mid-battle, while r/bitcoin has already declared victory.

Explain what the conditions would have to be that there would be single blocks that were 1 petabyte in size.

I have Bitcoin wallets on my phone. Those that can't run a full node do have other options. Does Electrum not exist?

I'm blown away at how you fundamentally don't understand how hypocritical this entire chain of thought really is. Why do you support Bitcoin? Apply your answer to what you've said you would consider doing with this altcoin in relation to a specific user. Give me a fucking break.  
  
EDIT: I'm officially against Core now. Not gonna fuck around with a dev that even entertains this idea. This is entirely opposite of why I support cryptocurrency.
