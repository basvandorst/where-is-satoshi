Depends on how you view bitcoin. If you view it as a store of value, Mike Novagratz (via CNBC) has given a few interviews explaining BTC and its future. YouTube it. People seem to understand bitcoin better as digital gold.

You are correct. In fact, most casinos are networking their machines now (think 2000+ slots) which are really just computers operating a RNG (random number generator). Some states allow an “area-progressive” which links machines throughout a state - imagine what you could do with that!!?!

Get the full match in the 401k. Then buy BTC with 10% of your monthly disposable income (the extra money after bills and necessities). Only buy BTC with money that you can afford to completely lose.

Ha! It wasn’t completely lost on me when I made the purchase. 
I figured if I was going to make a purchase with BTC - why not make it one with a shot at retaining or increasing in value. 
It was interesting to go through the process. I can see how the consumer will find making purchases with bitcoin easier than other methods. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:32:55
Not sure really. We will find out. It’s worth speculating. I own bitcoin and happy with the return and amount I have so far.

You should purchase more things with a credit card.... then come back and edit your comment. 
I was charged less by the retailer to use BTC than with a Credit Card. Also, it was easier. I snapped a QR code and was done.  No entering private credit card numbers, expiration date , security code...

A lot of people have fiat currency stock piled for emergency funds and savings. They are not spending it......yet it still a currency.

Simply put - you don’t really own bitcoin until you have the keys. Buy either one of the wallets you mentioned and move your bitcoin.

Well... today’s prices and this guys words have me moving everything to a hard wallet. I know, I know.... not your keys, not your bitcoin. Just now getting around to it.
