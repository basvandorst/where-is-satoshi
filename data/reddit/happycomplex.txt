In the picture I see an option that says "All exchanges"
Does this mean if I am looking at the btc_ltc trading pair with "all exchanges" selected, instantdex will combine the orderbooks from btc-e, bitfinex, btc38, cryptsy into a single orderbook?
So I can use instantdex to pay the lowest possible price for ltc, for example?

It's really not fud.  There have been so many red flags and complaints about cryptsy over the past two years that you would be insane to put any money on there.

This is if you pay any attention to altcoin section on bitcointalk.
Here are three threads from december 2013 talking about lawsuits against cryptsy for similar problems.  One guy filed complaint with florida attorney general because cryptsy was not honoring his 63 btc withdrawal.
I'm sure I can find dozens more threads from 2013/2014/2015 about issues with cryptsy if I bothered to search for more than 3 minutes.

I wonder how many governments are already secretly holding or mining bitcoin.
We already know many individual government agents are secret bitcoin users/hodlers.
I don't understand why US gov. sold 1% of supply of bitcoins they had.  If they want to control bitcoin, they should have held onto 1% of supply.  
Maybe they have an additional 100k+ coins that they are still holding in secret?
