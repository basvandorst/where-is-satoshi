when will coinami and mycelium adopt segwit? pretty please guys.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:57:29
yep! when bcash is up they come out in full force it's ridiculous to cherry pick a crypto's reference. I made a goofy subreddit for people to make posts about the non-meaning of bcash in today's crypto world.

is there a way to run a full node on an old android phone?
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:11:44
I don't plan to buy anymore unless I can via the etf.

use other cryptocoins that aren't clogged and can innovate changes in their lifetime.

I think once mycelium and coinami support segwit transactions that will help a lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:41:52
We start with what can be implemented today in wallets. Segwit is on the network. wallet providers like mycelium and coinami haven't implemented it and should asap.

Bitcoin cash and bitcoin addresses are the same no? Wouldn't it just depend on what type of node the app connects to?

Why is there a shifter on a tesla?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:05:43


People are not arguing that this is a shapeshift type service going from bitcoin to bitcoincash. The only thing this change does it scare people that their coins aren't being received when in actuality they did. A private key on BCH can spend btc on btc network. 
You will not lose access to the coins, this is fear mongering. The access to the coins just require an extra step.

If you take out your initial investment, is it still gambling?
@_date: 2016-10-17 06:46:21
I've thought the same thing. Could you have part of the block chain on the USB or DVD then the rest on a local hdd?

I saw too many tips!
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:45:19
Cool story bro.

aaaaand that's why ordinary people are sketched out about bitcoin security.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:31:49
you gott whip out your wallet and a give your card to the waiter then wait.
you gotta whip out your phone, open mycelium, enter the bill total, enter your pin number. all this takes time and is not only time but effort of using your phone.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:30:04
I know exactly what you're talking about. bitcoin at a restaurant is not faster than credit card since you just gotta pull out your wallet and hand them the credit card. 
With bitcoin you gotta whip out your phone, enter the exact amount of the bill, enter your pin number, and then let the transaction propagate. 
is bitcoin more secure than credit card? yes in the short term of not having to deal with getting a CC compromised but a CC user can always get a chargeback for a fraudulent charge.
is bitcoin faster than whipping out the wallet and handing cash then waiting for your change to come back? very negligible. and the cash would be just a secure obviously.

I have a bandwidth cap, run a node, stream movies, and I've never hit it.
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:55:31
I'm not a miner, but if I run a full node, will it help transactions be processed faster? Will I have lots of traffic and it will flag my ISP? I'd like to contribute to bitcoin some way. Thanks.

IF someone started issuing a private currency backed by bitcoins, what do you think would happen to that?
@_date: 2013-03-03 07:46:30
are these yours?

I bought mine at the all time high of $32.

I think if we change it, we should go straight to satoshis. I've got 500,000 satoshis. That's not that hard to grasp.

How different is this to bitcoingem?
@_date: 2013-05-05 00:02:19
I believe bitcoin is going to succeed because the way paypal and western union are talking about it. They could have pursued getting lobbyists to try to end it, but didn't. These huge corporations probably already considered it and didn't see lobbying being successful.
