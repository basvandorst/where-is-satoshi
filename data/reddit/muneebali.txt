Not really trying to copy Namecoin here, because we actually started off by *using* Namecoin. Documented a bunch of our lessons in a USENIX ATC'16 research paper -- 
Summary of the lessons is that a single mining pool had ~65% hashpower and the network was not very reliable in our experience. 
As for spamming Bitcoin, we take great care in reducing the no. of transactions needed on the blockchain e.g., the update operation no longer needs a blockchain transaction. Similarly, we have a subdomain system in the works that works off-chain. 
The real benefit is attaching cloud storage seamlessly with a record that you initial register on the blockchain and then controlling that unlimited storage space using your private keys. If anything, that should encourage developers to use Blockstack storage for non-financial applications and not try to embed all sorts of data directly into the blockchain (blockchain is not general-purpose storage).
Edit: single miner -&gt; single mining pool

We have plans to patch the Unbound DNS resolver for this purpose, if you want to enable domain resolution with something compatible with traditional DNS. 
When you pip install blockstack the CLI had a default public Blockstack Core server that you can use to resolve domains. You can install your own server and point the CLI to your server. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:23:48
Yep, it's on Bitcoin. And nope not moving to ETH. There are conversations around writing a "driver" for the ETH chain and supporting creation of *new* namespaces on it i.e., support for multiple blockchains in Blockstack. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:07:43
Without getting into a discussion about is this a good way to verify the Bitcoin package itself, as suggested by let's look at package verification in general. 
Bitcoin Core is not working on becoming a general-purpose tool for verifying software packages. Blockstack is working on that use case. 
If you sign your package releases and have multiple proofs of your identity on Blockstack, then I'd argue that it's a pretty neat system to verify the integrity of packages.
The proof that you're getting is that muneeb.id, who also owns  on Twitter, and owns  on Github, and owns muneebali.com on DNS, and owns the PGP key "9862 A3FB 338B E9EB 6C6A 5E05 639C 8927 2AFE C540" has signed off on the python package "stripe-flask" with his keys.
Once you add signatures from multiple developers, it becomes even more powerful.
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:01:17
Names are not important in this system. The proofs attached to the names are.
The author of the article could have picked randomyoda.id. It's the proofs attached to randomyoda.id which are valuable, not the name.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:56:57
Would love to hear specifics on how it's pretextual.
Security of systems built on top of Bitcoin should not impact the reputation of Bitcoin, just like applications built on top of the Linux kernel don't really impact the reputation of the Linux kernel.
Also, in my view, people using the security of the base Bitcoin layer to do interesting things on top is a good thing and should be encouraged. It's much better than the alternate solutions available out on the traditional Internet.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:56:58
Namecoin is a separate blockchain. Blockstack runs on top of Bitcoin (and can run on any blockchain). See this for details: 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:31:58
Yep, pool. Let me edit my comment to clarify that it's a pool.
I think if a single pool had &gt; 51% on Bitcoin, r/bitcoin would be on fire. It's a pretty big issue :-)
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:10:13
Yes, absolutely. Running your own resolver makes sense and that's why we have the open-source resolver ( and encourage companies to run their own. A lot of web developers don't want to deal with running their own servers (you'll need to ensure the reliability and uptime of the resolver and so on). The API is meant to simplify development for such developers. We have a cluster of nodes running with advanced mechanisms for load-balancing, uptime etc.
Running the resolver is not that costly thing in terms of resources needed, but if you look at the calls for unspent outputs -- it'll take you days, even weeks to calculate that. That's where the API really shines and gives really quick, reliable access to things like unspent outputs. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:03:29
Please see the discussion thread here:
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:08:20
That's an example of our anti-squatting mechanism. We have no intention of ever making any money by "selling usernames". We've parked a few names because of the high likelihood of those names being prime target for squatters and will give out those usernames on a per case basis. Namecoin has a big name squatting problem and you need anti-squatting measures. We plan on working with the Namecoin developers for further improving the anti-squatting mechanism and discourage squatters from grabbing a large amount of names. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:13:33
One of the OneName devs here. Great to see you draw this analogy of IP address = bitcoin address and OneName = DNS. This is *exactly* our motivation. Looking forward to contributions from the community to make this effort successful! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:57:32
We will be adding that feature shortly and will send an email update. Thanks for being an early user! 
Your profile however has been submitted to the blockchain and no one can modify your data without the passphrase/private-key that you saved. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:00:10
Yes, OneName currently uses the Namecoin blockchain. 
If you already have namecoins, you can follow the steps on  to register your name yourself manually. 
Edit: As for paying for registration: we're letting early users register for free (and footing the bill), as a thank for being early adopters :-) 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:12:53
your email doesn't go into the blockchain, and you can register without using any email at all by following the instructions here:
Further, you can have pseudonyms like  
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:59:54
You are absolutely right about someone else being able to register a name on the blockchain before you. That's why we can't give any guarantee that the name you submitted is actually yours until the name update has been confirmed on the blockchain. 
With that said, the probability of some other person getting your usernames within that time window is kinda small. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:23:03
Not if you stay decentralized. Check out  for the DNS-like services which are now completely open-sourced. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:20:57
No, in the Namecoin blockchain. OneName the protocol is independent of the underlying blockchain. We currently use Namecoin, but it's possible to have a separate blockchain as well.
Namecoin is a key-value store and embedding data there is totally fine.  
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:01:29
yes, it'll be possible very soon
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:05:34
We did debate asking people to enter the passphrase again. It's a tradeoff between user experience and ensuring they wrote it down. 
Thanks! Yes, the real power of the platform is in sharing additional data like PGP keys, bitcoin (or other crypto currency addresses) and so on. We're very excited about these possibilities. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:30:20
Yes, the OneName protocol is completely independent of the underlying blockchain. All we need is a key-value store really.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:01:13
We got way more registrations/load than we expected. Had to fire up more servers and will get to these things very soon! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:46:42
Nope, Nameid is a different project. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:55:27
And make email addresses publicly available to encourage SPAM? This is a public listing of BTC addresses, much like yellow/white pages that people use for phone numbers. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:30:41
Kindly, see my reply to your other thread: 
@_date: 2014-08-09 19:54:58
Muneeb from OneName here. We've received a lot of requests for supporting stealth addresses and will certainly look into it (can't promise right now if we will support them or how quickly can we launch it, but we're definitely discussing this, so stay tuned!). 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:19:37
People can connect their other identities to OneName and provide public proofs e.g., github, twitter, domain names etc. When sending BTC to +muneeb there can be a pop up that says, this user has proof of ownership of the domain muneebali.com, of the twitter handle  of the github account muneeb-ali and so on. This is much more trust worthy than sending BTC to any random long-hex-string. 
You can see such proofs in action on OneName profiles of people who've signed up. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:57:59
Stealth addressees solve that. You can have them with your Onename profile. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:24:05
Any person seeing the public data in the blockchain can see that public data (just like bitcoin transactions are public). Private data an be kept in cloud/distributed storage outside of the blockchain. 
The use of the blockchain has no direct implications on public vs private. The use of the blockchain is mainly to remove the need for trusted third parties. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:58:54
but you can use multiple "centralized sources" e.g., twitter, github, DNS and so on. it removes power from any single "central" source. 
Also, if people start following each other then just OneName users can give credibility to other OneName users the same way it happens on Twitter. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:59:58
Registration expires every 8 months, so in that sense it's like domain names that you have to renew. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:42:44
OK, I take it to mean that there is no point in trying to have a civil conversation with you. Have a good day :-)
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:12:58
The choice is yours. You can register a pseudonym like   ... and attach a bitcoin address to that name. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:14:38
Agreed that Onename lets you use any address/wallet, so the security of the bitcoins depend on which wallet you're using. With that said, having 2FA is just better in general to protect the account i.e., the web consumer product that let's you login and make changes to your profile.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:21:47
I think it's a Namecoin design choice that makes the namespaces easy to squat. We've tried preserving names that have the highest probability for squatting, but in the long run either the way Namecoin pricing for new names and renewals works will need to change or some other key-value store (with better anti-squatting incentives) will take over.
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:53:16
"Namecoin is designed in such a way that you need to scan the whole blockchain to resolve a name." &lt;-- that's not true. Namecoind keeps a local DB of name resolutions (and you can build similar things yourself as well). Scanning the entire blockchain would take minutes and queries are resolved within microseconds already. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:29:39
Muneeb from Onename here. Lots of people seem to be asking "why". Let me answer that question here. 
Bitcoin gives you access to digital money with your private key. Bitcoin can replace banks. Everyone in r/Bitcoin understands that. 
Onename gives you access to your profile data (usernames, profile picture, friend graph etc) with your private key. Current social networks like LinkedIn/Facebook/Twitter are "data banks". And a system like Onename can replace them. 
As for why: same benefits as with Bitcoin:
1) Only you are in control of your data. You have completely privacy control over your data instead of being dependent on third parties. 
2) Just like Bitcoin opened a new era of innovation (so many companies and open-source projects are using Bitcoin to do interesting things). A decentralized social profiles/graph can open a new era of innovation where developers can build interesting apps without requiring permission from LinkedIn/Facebook etc. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:16:36
I have  and a bunch of other pseudonyms. You can have privacy along with ease of use. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:21:34
It's an open-source project with an open namespace. 
It actually was not technically possible to have a decentralized namespace (i.e., not owned by any company/third-party) before blockchains. I doubt that anyone has ever tried creating a truly decentralized namespace with human-readable names. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:18:16
Oh OK, got it. Yeah it looks clean right now.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:03:13
The registration process on the website asks you to enter your username manually before registering and adding a CAPTCHA there is one-line of code. 
Under the hood, you actually need to burn coins to register names. So names are not free. The person who wants to register the whole dictionary will need to spend money on doing so and names expire every 8 months. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:12:15
Agreed that a centralized solution will not work. There are ways to do this in a completely decentralized way though e.g., by building this on top of a blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:46:43
Looks like you're familiar with how it's implemented as well! Have you been using it for a while?
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:25:14
It's not a centralized service. Data goes to a blockchain and only the user has the private key to her data. 
And there is permanent username-to-address association either. You can keep changing the BTC address. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:23:26
Yes, absolutely. Here are the instructions for how to do it yourself:
And no we don't hold the private keys. Only the user has the keys. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:31:56
We'll do nothing for the case of McDonalds. Actually, we cannot do anything even if we wanted to. It's a *decentralized* namespace. Only the person who has the pvt key can control the address.  There are pros and cons of not having a central regulator. We believe that the benefits are much more than potential negative things (same as for Bitcoin, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin).  
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:14:20
OneName is built on Namecoin and puts data in the Namecoin blockchain. Only the person who has the private key can modify the data. It is decentralized and is not a centralized service. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:11:32
Do you mean a) how do you register a username on  or b) what can you do after you have registered a username? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:55:28
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:48:46
You can put any bitcoin address in your profile (be it from Coinbase, blockchain.info, your Desktop wallet, anything). To make registration simple, we create a default bitcoin address for users -- the passphrase that you wrote down can also give you the private key for that bitcoin address and you can use this private key to use the bitcoin address however you want. So the passphrase acts both as a private key for your username/data and for the bitcoin address (if you use the default generated address). 
 
We plan to put up instructions for how to use your private key to withdraw money and link to some services that can enable you to do so. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:54:04
We're handing out names using the procedure described at 
Anyone can fire up a namecoin daemon and start doing exactly what we're doing. This is an open-source protocol. Just like anyone can participate in Bitcoin as long as they have a client or an account on a service like Coinbase, blockchain.info etc. Anyone can participate in OneName as long as they have a client or use some service provider. 
Further, no central authority controls the names. Only the user has the private key to the names (just like in Bitcoin only the user has the private key to their account that has their coins) 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:00:20
So what's your point? We're operating at the abstraction level of a key-value store. Any key-value store will work. Obviously the "implementation detail" will have practical implications e.g., 519 bytes of data per entry and so on. Are you saying that it's not possible to built it on some other key-value store? or are you surprised that the particular implementation choice has its implications? 
Why don't you lay out your criticism and we'll be happy to address it. I was only trying to direct everyone to the same thread, so that we can have a single view of the conversation instead of individual 1-on-1 threads. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 19:57:25
You should check out our open-source tool, called OpenDig: 
Integrating OneName is literally two lines of code.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:53:24
Oh so then maybe using a new bitcoin address (that you don't normally use) can work? We do provide a default new address. Also, it's possible to change your bitcoin address from time to time (when you update your profile) 
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:26:36
Umm I actually know her in real life, but that's besides the point. What's with the hating? Are you part of the Namecoin/NameID gang as well who was apparently really pissed that someone actually decided to use their open-source software for something constructive? There is a thread for that: 
 
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:52:54
Everyone should have a private key that only they control and should be able to register a username, login to websites/services, update their profile etc using that private key. No trusted third parties required at all.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:49:21
Just like with Bitcoin your private key gives you access to your account (and the money in your account), with OneName your private key gives you access to your username and profile data. There is no "central authority" for assigning or managing names. 
The profile data is stored directly in the blockchain and no one (no central authority, or company, or hacker) can change that data without your private key.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:55:10
Definitely. We want to put those up on Github and then ask the community to help improve those documentations. 
Right now we only provide instructions for building namecoind on Debian and getting that running. We need to expand on those instructions and include steps for registering/updating profiles etc. Also most users don't use Debian/Linux and won't build/compile things themselves and we need instructions for OS X, Windows etc -- so definitely room for more work there. Here is the link for building namecoin though:
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:56:06
I can confirm that this is a bug. I can see your username on the blockchain, but due to some formatting error (in the profile data) our server is not displaying your profile properly. We'll fix this! I'm assuming you registered this yourself directly on namecoin? 
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:21:37
The problem to solve is "distributed consensus". How do all participants of the social network agree on the state of the network without having any centralized party. The blockchain solves that. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:57:43
the feature is already there, you can replace the BTC address at the time of registration (and can use one from Coinbase, blockchain.info, or your custom address). we'll add a profile update feature soon and you can then edit your BTC address
and yes, through our interface you have to trust that we're not storing your private key, you can do a manual registration using namecoind (instructions on our github) if you chose to not trust our service 
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:01:46
Gavin, we reserved  for you and will look into impersonation via +gavin. When we enable verifications like Github, Twitter etc, it'll be harder for others to impersonate (without taking over other online identities) 
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:43:53
Higher transaction fees is one way of dealing with the situation. The bitcoin community can decide to raise the limit as well. He should've talked about *both* possible solutions. I don't think it's "incorrect" to talk about the possibility of raising the limit. But yes, it would've been better to talk about higher transaction fees as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:41:30
Isn't NameID an OpenID provider? Also, looking at the data in the id/ namespace it appears that a) the namespace is heavily squatted and b) people are using it for all sorts of different things and there doesn't seem to be a clear use or format of the data. With that said, we'd love to work with the nameid developers as it does look like nameid was also started (a few years back?) to tackle similar problems.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:11:07
embedding a BTC address in the blockchain is just a start (for v0.1), it's actually fairly simple to build a simple API end-point that your blockchain entry points to and that API end-point can return whatever BTC address you like and change it how many ever times you like 
right now all data is embedded in the blockchain, there is absolutely no limitation why it needs to be the case 
the problem we're solving is about "bootstrapping trust", you need a common ground for people to agree on who is who .. once people can have a truly decentralized identity, what can be build on top of that is only limited by the imagination of the developers 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:46:21
Good point. The current registration is 0.01 NMC actually and at the current cost of NMC is negligible. We can comfortably register users right now for the foreseeable future and for the long run we plan on working on improving the underlying requirements of the blockchain registration fees. We have some exciting solutions in the works. The identity system/protocol is blockchain agnostic and the underlying tech re blockchain can, and most probably will, be improved as we move forward :-)
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:41:00
I'll like to point out that this is a decentralized product, which means that the namespace still exists even if we (the current developers) stop working on it and  (the website) disappears. Not that any of that is going to happen (we're working actively on the project).
This is different from getting a username from a company like Facebook, Twitter (where if the company shuts down all usernames are gone, because you never controlled them anyway). 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:14:44
UPDATE: fixed the bug in profile display! 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:00:07
The above test runs live, so when they patch it should say that it's not vulnerable. 
Also, I wouldn't try to change the password or even use Bitstamp right now. It's an SSL bug that exposes things that are in memory. You don't want an active session (with your password etc) with Bitstamp right now.
Just my view, security is not my area of computer expertise. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:20:28
You don't have to run a full namecoind on your computer. SPV clients can also work. Also, can use command-line tools like opendig that talk to public namecoin servers ( and compare the data received from multiple servers. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:01:20
The protocol supports identity verification e.g., on Twitter and Github and so on, so unless you can Tweet from  on Twitter or post a file using his Github account, you won't be able to verify that you're the same Gavin Andresen as the one on Twitter and Github. The more "verified sources" we add the higher the probability of verification e.g., verified domains and so on. 
Similarly, bitcoin addresses can have verified signatures. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:59:00
Yes, it's possible. I'll update you soon on exactly how you can do it. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:42:27
We don't want to put your email address in the blockchain! So no, the email is not in the blockchain. We just took the email, so that we can get in touch with you for updates about your profile (or if something goes wrong during the registration/activation on the blockchain). 
BTW, to see exactly what data goes in the blockchain, you can append ".json" to any profile and see the actual data e.g., for my profile
you can append .json and see
 
that's the data that goes into the blockchain and then anyone can view it however they want or programmers can use the data to build apps. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:53:39
I'm glad it worked!
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:47:23
We're getting a *lot* of request for names and will try to get back to all of them as soon as we can. Thanks for trying out OneName! 
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:37:13
It was an error in how we were displaying profiles. All seems fine now.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:56:02
We're releasing the profile update feature very soon and will send people an email update later today or tomorrow. Please keep in mind that this is a very early release of OneName and many other features etc are in the pipeline. Thanks for being an early user! 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:47:51
Yep, we use the namecoin blockchain and you don't need to go through our website to access/modify your data. That's the beauty of a truly decentralized system :-) 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:05:44
We're letting early users register for free, as a thank for being early adopters. But yes, you're right that namecoins cost money :-)
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:08:34
The website is just one way of registering yourself on the Namecoin blockchain. We try to make it easier for people who're not tech-savvy. You can always fire up a namecoin client or namecoind on Linux and register yourself on OneName without ever going through our website. We have some helpful instructions for that on our Github and we're in the process of adding more details/instructions: 
Also, we transfer names from our "hot wallet" to *your* namecoin address. We're not a service like Coinbase where you can keep your data/coins with us: that's the entire purpose of making users write down their passphrase/private-key. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 20:50:58
Would a JavaScript library be helpful? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:26:44
OneName provides a mapping between a unique username and a bitcoin address (all data is stored on the blockchain). I'm sure you can monitor the bitcoin address associated with a username and then notify the user immediately. Can probably do it even if the transaction is not confirmed yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:04:17

Yes, this can be built into Namecoin or some other blockchain-based key-value store. OneName is not a centralized service! In fact, it uses Namecoin exactly how you proposed. Here is the github repo:
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:00:37
We actually want to support such stealth/deterministic addresses. Your BTC address can change as frequently as you want, it's the username that stays constant. Much like saying that IP address behind cnn.com can change how ever frequently, but you can still view cnn.com as long as you remember to go to cnn.com. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:18:36
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:57:43
That is an internal thing used only for you to manage your account on onename.io (the consumer facing product). Your email is in no way associated with your username. The web interface is just a simple way to register you on the underlying protocol. The underlying protocol has absolutely no idea about your email address (your email address is not public and is not needed in anyway) 
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:32:24
Yes, we do plan to support other crypto-currencies as well :-) 
@_date: 2015-05-11 11:29:35
Not one private key, same security as Bitcoin -- you can own your identity using a m-of-n multi-sig address, put your master private key in cold storage and use child keys for daily use etc

He could just say "Inventor of Netscape" and that'd be a) a fact that doesn't need to be debated and b) still get the point across that it was one of the first browsers that most people used.

There is a price tag attached with name registrations. It's currently around 7 cents, but you can play around with how the pricing works to discourage spam.

I think the point is that you can use the domain sendcoins.to/username and not to actually send coins to Barry Silbert. Barry is just an example.

Some other people had a similar problem. See this issue on Github:

DNS is used as an example of a lookup service. Doesn't mean there needs to be a lookup service exactly like DNS. 
Yes, if bitcoin addresses become like IP addresses (they can exist but the user doesn't need to see them) that'll be great.
The payment pages on Coinbase are an example of a centralized approach (they own the namespace).

Oh got it, then you already have a passcard. Passcard is the "profile" that you have there. You can try this widget to embed your passcard at other places on the web:

Onename is a registrar. Blockstack ( is the open-source technology that builds a decentralized DNS on top of Bitcoin. **It's completely decentralized.**
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:04:50
It's working for me. Which browser are you using? 
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:38:48
No, the unique names will not be deleted. The names you're registering are getting registered on the Bitcoin mainnet. Blockstack ( is the decentralized DNS system being used here and it already runs as a production system on mainnet Bitcoin. 
You might need to update your GUID after openbazaar moves to mainnet though (this is my understanding, but I'd let some openbazaar dev confirm this).
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:40:05
I'll repeat my comment about Onename being decentralized:

This post is written by an engineer :-)
What you need is engineers who can communicate really well. It'd be very hard for your average marketing/PR person to clearly understand the complex technical issues involved with Bitcoin development. That's a non-starter for communication. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 17:20:37
Yeah, that's what I meant by explicitly differentiating between experiments and production. There is no way that the DAO was production ready.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:50:13
The speed should be similar to direct CLI registration with a small overhead for sure. We are pushing people to use the CLI directly and the desktop client (which is coming out) and register directly. 
And once again thanks for reporting the social media issue. We are working on that bug bounty and really appreciate that you took the time to report it.

Yep, runs on Blockstack (open-source software/system) which uses the Bitcoin blockchain.

Drop us an email at support and we can take a look. I'm pretty sure your account still exits. We migrated everyone from Namecoin to Bitcoin.

My intention here is to separate Ethereum the technology from their community, marketing, and developer evangelism. You can do a good job at the latter, but that doesn't necessarily imply that the technology is built on solid foundations.

Muneeb from Onename here. The protocol Onename uses is **completely decentralized** and the points made by OP are simply not valid. Using the u/ namespace (which Onename uses) is *no different* from using the id/ namespace. There are no security differences, just a different namespace. In fact, we've built a lot of open-source software that helps the Namecoin eco-system e.g., 
Remember that you don't have to use the Onename API at all. You can **simply use the open-source software/tools and run your own servers**. We're only working to make those tools easier to use and are keeping the open-source community alive and getting top-notch developers and researchers involved with the open-source efforts. 
Watch this talk I gave at Microsoft Research about what potential problems need to be solved before decentralized namespaces like Namecoin can be used for large-scale applications: 
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:20:42
There is **no difference** between manual registration on u/ and registering via Onename. We're just a registrar (think GoDaddy) on the **same** namespace and only users have private keys to their names. And no we only deal with the u/ namespace because everyone needs to agree on the same namespace, otherwise there will be name collisions.
Also, I'd really appreciate if you can edit your post:
a) "If you request the CoolToys store, you request is submitted to the OneName web API, which answers with the correct string that represents the store." &lt;-- this is not true. OpenBazaar can and most probably will run their own resolver 
b) "OneName came to light mid 2014, and avoided using the already existent /ID section" &lt;-- that's also not true. We launched March 2014 and in Dec 2013 were looking at Namecoin and at that time there was no documentation about id/.
c) "is for developers who want to register directly on the blockchain manually" &lt;-- that option is for anyone who can compile a Namecoin daemon and register. We've provided instructions  but in reality only a few people will be able to do this manual/direct registration. Our goal is to make this process *easier* for people in general.
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:45:03
Here is the original reply about u/ vs id/:
And the reasons haven't changed. In fact, if anything Namecoin is even less actively developed and therefore we've invested considerable effort in building blockstore --  Remember, the best maintained open-source tools win in the long run. We're only here to help make that happen. 
The decentralized auth identity post is still live. You just have the old URL:
Passcard is simply a renaming of an open-source project. 
There is no malice anywhere here. Just a bunch of engineers hacking on decentralized and open-source tools and writing code every day.

Namecoin vs. Bitcoin is a different debate. I'll post about why building on Bitcoin is more secure and provide scientific data. And we don't have any control over the namespace. Can't stress it enough that both the u/ namespace on Namecoin and namespaces on blockstore are **completely decentralized**.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:04:42
Muneeb from Onename here. This is an implementation of Namecoin on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain. There is *no centralized API* involved. It's a completely *decentralized* system. Open source code at: 
We will have more details coming out next week in a blog post and announcement. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2015-09-14 14:02:31
Doing human-readable names right on a blockchain **is a hard computer science problem**. We designed blockstore after 1+ year of practical experience of running one of the largest production systems on Namecoin and after having numerous discussions with some of the leading researchers and with Bitcoin core developers. 
For anyone interested in having a deeper understanding of the problem, read this paper by Arvind Narayanan (Princeton) -- 
The above article and also the  website has many many technical inaccuracies and I encourage the authors to correct them. I'm happy to help with fixing the technical inaccuracies.
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:29:17
Muneeb from Onename here. I'm quite surprised to see the lack of technical understanding in this post. I'm pinging Namecoin developers to confirm that this post was reviewed by Namecoin devs before being posted and that they stand behind this post.
First of all, it is **possible to have SPV-like functionality** in Blockstore. We will publish details about it. Secondly, SPV is a feature and not a security bug (their post treats it as some kind of a security loophole).
Their DHT arguments show a lack of understanding of how Blockstore's storage works. They **incorrectly assume that the DHT doesn't have global state. It does.**
Mining pools rejecting transactions is pure FUD. 
Consensus hash calculation argument show a **lack of understanding of the computational complexity of calculating them.**
We actually have a 12-page paper that talks about the design of Blockstore in detail, which is currently being peer reviewed by the computer science research community. We'll post a pre-print of that paper for everyone to help reduce FUD like this.
It doesn't make logical sense for us to put in almost an year of engineering effort to move from a more secure system to a less secure one :-)
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:54:43
We have a detailed blog post and announcement coming out early next week. It's mostly for security reasons and also for upgrading the infrastructure around registering blockchain IDs on a blockchain. Here is an earlier post that briefly touches these topics: 
@_date: 2016-10-06 16:21:33
Similar in the sense that it's a developer platform for decentralized apps. Ethereum focuses on smart contracts and movement of digital tokens. Blockstack focuses on general-purpose apps like decentralized messaging, Reddit, blogging etc. It also has naming and identity built-in. The technical implementation is very different from Ethereum and Blockstack keeps the blockchain layer very simple.
@_date: 2016-10-09 14:55:11
Yep, it's working and is live. The slow registration issue that users reported has been resolved. 
Also, checkout the Blockstack CLI for directly registering names (without going through the Onename app).
@_date: 2016-10-06 20:07:16
The web, unfortunately, got centralized over time. Most of the time you're just talking to Google or Facebook (companies, not protocols). This is a movement to give the power back to the users.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:30:14
It's not about the private keys, it's about the inputs. The inputs are all 0.00001 (e.g., see here  and when people will try to use these inputs to transfer the coins to some other private key it'll result in really really large transactions hence **it is a stress test**.

It runs on Bitcoin right now, but can run on any blockchain (operates at a higher layer). Lots of other differences, see

Thanks! Ha. Have you tried the new profile update system? It's really fast :-)
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:08:41
Yes! They're live! Try updating your profile. First time will be slow (as it hits the blockchain), but after that you'll have a "zone_file" that points to mutable storage with signed data.
You'll get a new zone_file field in the resolver response after that.

The reserved bitcoin idea also has a nice side-benefit that it incentivizes people to hold bitcoin. People really need to hold bitcoin (and not USD on a bitcoin exchange) for bitcoin to slowly take off.
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:52:22
Using Bitcoin because it's the most secure and most reliable blockchain. Would you build an application over TCP/IP (the most widely deployed, tested, and supported protocol) or something else? Again, it's an experiment to explore the question "can this be done on top of the bitcoin blockchain" if so what are the tradeoffs ... 
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:53:20
Not exactly. Similar programming interface though. More suited for read-heavy applications where the security of data is really important (can't rely on any server/service/third-party)

@_date: 2015-02-17 13:51:51
It's a generic key-value store and an early experiment. The production system at Onename is still on Namecoin (and will continue to be in the near-future). We believe that it's important to explore the design space of possible solutions for how best to build apps etc on top of blockchains and this effort is our stab at exploring building on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:51:32
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:49:56
We love Namecoin and they deserve all the credit for being the original blockchain to enable data embedding and name registrations. We're simply exploring other design approaches as an experiment. That's what researchers do, they study the design space and compare design tradeoffs. That's how society slowly makes progress and converges on the best designs/solutions while giving due credit to people who were there first. UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD etc went through this. Several different design points and as a result all operating systems got better.
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:55:00
Ah yeah, I wrote "Bitcoin didn't interfere" earlier. Updated it now to say "Bitcoin developers and community didn't interfere". I don't think it was even a realistic option, but that's the whole point! Says a lot about the culture of the developers and community vs. Ethereum.
For the fork stuff I was not talking about a HF. I was talking about everyday blockchain forks and orphaned blocks. I just made it more clear on the post -- thanks for the comments!
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:52:18
Developers do make the decision to start a hard fork, case in point Ethereum. And exchanges are taking sides during a hard fork on Ethereum. The entire discussion is about if there is a controversial hard fork, which party has more power.

Yes, absolutely!
