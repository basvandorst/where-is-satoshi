Most every business goal is to deal in what they know. If you sell cakes, you deal in cakes. That means you want to minimize risk from everything but making and selling cakes. So most every business will not want to take that risk on.

To make this comparable, Coke/Pepsi promise via contract to only produce 21m cans forever and .000001% of a can of coke has the same utility as 1 can when used for its purpose. 
So the only real fear isn't coke making more coke but a new company making Coke. Usually IP laws help here but not sure if that's relevant to protect crypto coins

Warren: you said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. 
Maybe you're wrong about lighting money on fire?

I'm sure you realize this but bitcoin can mantain its consensus with less and less people participating in its consensus, and with it, its value will plummet accordingly. Maybe a value of zero is unlikely but having its value hit materially zero is very possible. 
I suppose its only real value comes from being a form of currency outside of the "system", except for the fact that thousands of forms of currency offer this same benefit. 
All bitcoin has, at the end of the day, is trademark value.

The US Dollar is backed by the US Government. How could bitcoin compete against a US Government backed cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the US Dollar?

Why would USD ever go to zero? That's how you pay taxes and otherwise pay the government. BTC on the otherhand can go to zero because nothing is actually insuring its value.

Lol, I thought you meant consensus in the world among people. Blockchain technical consensus is pointless and means nothing.

Banks are FDIC insured upto 250k per checking account by the US Government. A bank going out of business does not mean your money is lost.
That's how Bank's make money. They take your money and invest it. That's their entire business model.

There is no consensus on bitcoin. It is very easy to imagine a world where bitcoin is completely forgotten for another cryptocurrency. 
The US Government is pushing for USD consensus. No one is pushing for BTC consensus except bagholders. But imagine how many USD bagholders are pushing for consensus. 
Your macroanalysis is trite.
