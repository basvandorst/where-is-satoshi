Nope. It's back in my igot.com account. It was cancelled, and re-credited to my balance. I also have $400AUD pending for bank withdrawal, no updates on this either but only submitted 24 hours ago. 
hope they respond soon as my coins are basically stuck in their site until i'm notified why my withdrawals were cancelled. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:14:18
they're talking about verification issues. I've completely verified my identity and account via documents and I've traded over $5,000 in and out of my bank account/bitcoin wallet without issues UNTIL the past 3 days where i haven't gotten any news on my 13BTC withdrawal.
I have no idea what's going on :/
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:18:52
I really do hope that is the case. I've got no hold what so ever on my account so I hope that is the situation. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:07:13
definitely :/
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:34:55
they're a registered company, 13th PTY LTD but I can't find company info on the web.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:20:46
I've got SS's of my current account status (level 2 verified) and the 13BTC pending for withdrawal.
I withdrew 5BTC amounts without issues, i don't see why this one is taking so long.
I personally believe and hope this is all some sort of leave for australia day or over the weekend or a small bug that they've skipped mine...but the more i wait for support the more i lose hope.
I hope i'm the only one experiencing issues, and that igot are working on my withdrawal

Read the latest updates...
stop trying to scab upvotes by posting shitty jokes that have already been posted lol...
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:21:46
I'm located in australia, now 11pm on Tuesday (australia day was Monday) and all business regimes are as usual with everyone else.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:09:34
As stated in the last comment with my reddit post, I'm having the same issues.
13BTC took 3 days and then got cancelled and didn't even get processed and NOT UPDATE from igot.
I'm getting annoyed.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:19:57
Come on with the jokes...
joke when this is resolved.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:24:16
13BTC total, one 12BTC withdrawal one 1BTC withdrawal. Over 10BTC, right?
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:19:06
so are withdrawals working for you? my .25 is still pending, requested hours ago.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:15:18
I've contacted twitter and was told to make a ticket
I also messaged their reddit, facebook, sent in multiple tickets no response
My situation: 
It sucks, because i've been using them without issue for around a year and now issues are arising.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:04:31
New update: iGot.com has replied and marked my account due to "all accounts even in the slightest suspiciousness are being reviewed". Even though it's a shitty reason, it's understandable that they're looking out for fraud. I'll keep you all updated as my coins are still in limbo and I can't withdraw bitcoin nor fiat, so this is still open for comments.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:22:10
**Update 4:** Bank $400AUD confirmed, waiting for arrival in bank account. Received 3BTC in withdrawals almost instant and back to normal thank god. I'll keep you all updated if anything goes wrong again.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:13:37
My account is still on hold due to failed login attempts which weren't by me. They will not remove the hold, and have asked for me to remove these posts.
I've stated i'll mark them as resolved when my account is back to instant standings rather than its current state.
Hopefully this is closed within the next 24 hours, glad support is actually responding though. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 07:06:03
Update on my situation: 
They cancelled my withdrawals and did not give me an email nor response to any of my contact methods regarding why they did so.
This is bs.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:24:40
if that was the case, they would at least inform me.
fingers are crossed
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:07:00
Update 3: just got an email saying to request another withdrawal after providing some more verification with bank receipts. Waiting for my withdrawal, hopefully it's instant, and hopefully my fiat one comes through as well. I'll keep you all updated.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:26:51
nope, im aus trying to use a legit local exchange with large volume and so far it isn't working!!!
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:32:04
Commonwealth and the worst thing about this is the 13BTC was not purchased @ igot it was earned through other sources. So even if it were a fiat issue, it has nothing to do with my 13BTC that is pending withdrawal.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:12:02
Same here, level 2 verified over a year ago. I bought $2k or so without problems a while ago, and just a few days ago cashed out 8BTC without issues. Only since Saturday have i been experiencing some major issues with withdrawing and no support at all which is extremely worrying...
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:42:07
I'll just update the OP stating issue is resolved (as of this post still not resolved)...
just giving them some extra verification as requested...weird how they're replying in early hours of the morning (4am here) when they are australia based. Definitely not business hours!
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:32:25
I also withdrew 8BTC total (2x withdraws) without any issues (within 2 hours each withdrawal) last week...hence im worried something has happened to the site. I've gotten no update whether it is a security check, or whether the site is having problems. Either way the delay is not explained and my 13BTC~ has been pending for over 72 hours
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:53:53
no phone numbers we can contact. I hope this is some sort of error, I doubt they would scam for ~30BTC (well, we're the only ones who have reported our issues). Hopefully they reply asap.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:22:45
It would cost me more to put up a legal fight for 13BTC.
I'm pretty let down. I've trusted igot for nearly a year and this is by far my biggest let down with the.
I hope that they start replying and process our withdrawals. They need 24/7 phone support or something over the phone if they want to be successful, email just isn't enough. Even live chat support would improve this stressful process considerably
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:08:12
Mine were cancelled at 5pm AEST. all 13BTC is back in my account and I tried to do a .25BTC test, still pending as of now and NO UPDATE from igot. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:28:57
unsure if in hiding or genuinely not logged in. Hopefully he'll popup soon to explain.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:21:14
I'm australian so first think when I type australian exchange, igot came up. I did research, saw no unresolved scam reports and I've been happy until this situation.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:23:09
Both good ideas...though I think waiting is a better option. I'm definitely moving to another AUS exchange after this to be safe.

Reddit URL:

This is bs.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:31:22
Exactly. if this were fiat, i would be completely fine with this wait as it's understandable. BTC should be instant, end of story.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:35:53
This is bullshit, absolute crap. Thank god for satoshi or we would be forced to abide by this crap in our currencies.
