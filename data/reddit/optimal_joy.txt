$100 Million USD is nothing to the US government.  They certainly have the computing power to compromise the block chain and probably already have.

How can you be so sure?  Do you think that they would immediately shut down bitcoin if they did?  I don't think they would announce it and just use the capability to monitor the bitcoin economy and keep track of everything as part of investigating organized crime or terrorist activity.

Has it always been like this?  Will it continue?  This seems to be more true for the alternate coins like LTC, PPC, TRC, NMC, all of which I've been having a ball toying around with.  up/down, up/down, buy/sell, lol.. it's almost *too easy!*

This is the exact problem that I'm having right now.  I have about $200 that I want to convert into bitcoins, NOW, and I'm having a hell of a time trying to figure this out.

I'm thinking of investing in bitcoins, but I want to wait for the price to drop before I buy.  I know that's very simplistic, because nobody knows for sure, but do you really think it will drop that low again?

Your markup is insulting!  Greedy bastards!

Those people are charging double current market value.  They're charging minimum $114/btc and they are $59 on some exchanges.

You can't compare the stock price of one corporation to a unique currency system, they aren't even apples and oranges.
