I am saying that we DO NOT KNOW what he did.

Then again, some of them do belong there because they are harmful, violent, and predatory, in which case I do not believe he would be deserving of help.
We DO NOT KNOW what he did, and my original remark was in response to the fact that no one else seemed to be asking this fundamental question.

Just because China and Norway have decided that bitcoin is not money doesn't make it so. Bitcoin was designed for individuals and small organizations, as a tool to vacate the money power held by thugs and tyrants. Of COURSE they're going to do whatever they can to discredit bitcoin.

The majority of thefts involve people storing their bitcoin in online wallets, including the wallets inside stores, exchanges, and fake drug bazaars.
You need to learn how to use bitcoin, how to have a wallet on your computer with strongly encrypted private keys (or in paper or brain wallets) which you use to store your bitcoin, not in online wallets. When you do this, yes, it's ironclad.

Study the picture above the article. Look at Clifford Stoll. Note his probable age. He is a baby boomer.
Baby boomers were raised as spoiled brats, largely from the major influence of the Dr. Spock book on parenting. As adults, they have continued to behave as spoiled brats. They take and take and take and invent all kinds of justification for their selfishness. They have never really been comfortable with advanced technology (in the aggregate), and they think they know it all.
They are currently in power. They dominate government, business, and the media. The good news is their influence and the widespread evil and destruction they have brought to the world through their selfishness is on the wane.

How about a desktop application that can generate a key pair, BIP38-encrypt the private key, then save the public key and encrypted private key both as text and QR codes? bitaddress.org does these things, but your app could differentiate itself by being: 1) completely free of Internet connection and 2) have a random number generator for the private key with a high and verifiable degree of entropy.
This app would allow people the advantages of a really secure wallet without printers or paper. The text and QR code (png) files could safely be distributed around the users' storage, and in the cloud.

It's entirely relevant; you assert that "the money of the Internet" should be taken nowhere near the Internet. It runs entirely on the Internet.

People who do expose their private keys on the Internet or who trust them to third parties are fools.

Perhaps you haven't noticed, but there's a lot of people on here (libertarians, anarcho-capitalists) that aren't big fans of arbitrary rules that don't really help or protect anyone.
People have the right to upvote "blatant pandering spam" if they wish, just like you have the right to attempt to "rescue" people, but perhaps you can see why many here would see your actions as controlling, constraining, and basically unwanted. No one elected you as the police chief, Chief.

Obsessed? I wasn't even replying to you, just giving others the opportunity to check you and your twin's post history and draw their own conclusions.
However, since you like perseverating on how awesome your karma is  (by my count, at least 6 times to me), and since you seem to have a preoccupation with "quality posts" and "shitposts," I decided to dig a little deeper:
I won't address link karma, since you barely have any, but with regard to comment karma, it would indeed appear that you beat me for Most Upvotes. You also beat me for Most Downvotes. Same for Best and Worst.
However, I think most would agree that the really salient number here is average karma/comment. Reddit thinks mine are more relevant than yours by a factor of 6, 51.8 to your 8.5.

For now and for at least several years, correct. If it gets to the point of a much larger market cap and much wider use, where volatility is abated, its inherent deflationary characteristics (including loss of coins) could make it attractive for short- or medium-term store of value.

This. It is much more likely to coexist with fiat. It's a new asset class that's a little bit like a currency and a little bit like a commodity.

This WILL happen, it's a question of when, not if ... and it's going to be massive. 2008 was merely the opening salvo.

I disagree strongly with your assessment; you're severely underestimating the seismic changes that come with Bitcoin. In addition to fiat converstion becoming less important, banks themselves will become less important.

Which is why smart people (including but not limited to holders of bitcoin) are in the process of vacating their bank accounts, or at least switching to smaller/friendlier services like credit unions. It's a trickle right now, but I expect this trend will continue to grow as more people get fed up with banks.

No. My opinion about Bitcoin has grown out of patient analysis.

This question is often centered around what businesses do/do not accept bitcoin. The much more important question is what incentives do consumers have for using it instead of cash dollars or credit cards? The realistic answer, at this time, is very little.
I expect this to change over time, but I also think that bitcoin's big future moves will not be centered around consumer adoption, but rather store of value/inflation hedge and foreign remittance.

This might help you: I've traded a lot of my fiat money for bitcoin, but I don't see it as an "investment" in the traditional sense, meaning that I don't want to turn it back into more fiat at a later date.

Ok, geniuses, I have a burning question:
At one point he describes a scenario where Party A agrees to pay Party B if the latter creates a functional Web site within 60 days. If the work is not complete, the payment does not go through. This is basically escrow, and he's saying it's built in to the Bitcoin protocol, where everything I've previously read indicates that escrow is an outstanding problem of Bitcoin because transactions cannot be reversed.
Can someone enlighten me here? Is this really possible with the protocol as it stands?

A security represents partial ownership of an asset, usually a corporation or fund. Bitcoin does not represent ownership of any other entitiy.
