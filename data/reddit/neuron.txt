Quality post.

Good on you, show the world your bigotry at any available opportunity.

Yeah well good luck transacting it on it with the existing backlog and tx fees.

Good for you kiddo, no one is saying you can’t. You’re the one making the fuss.

Maybe it’s about time the US stopped using that shitty paper money and took a page from the rest of the advanced world with polymer notes.
But I guess baby steps... let’s stay focused on the metric system.

No because the only ones with a corrupting influence are those with money. A person living on the poverty line isn’t going to be able to pay off anyone to make things happen/stop things from happening.
It simply allows the rich to have even more disproportionate power than they do in a country that isn’t corrupt.

Quite interesting how popular crypto seems to be in Latin America.

Just create a mobile wallet on one of the plethora of wallet applications out there and generate a receiving address which comes with a QR code.
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:27:57
Are you asking how to print a physical sticker of your qr code..?
Take a screenshot of the code, crop/edit/copy into whatever size and number you want.
Go to a print shop and print pages of stickers to your hearts content.

Faster transactions and lower transaction fees.

This is not a crash, it's a small fluctuation. 
Buy for the tech/idea/vision and hodl for several years. 
If anything you should double down and buy more now IF you can afford it (I.e. Are willing to lose it).

Weak hands always fold. And live to regret it.

What about availability/function during the period of chaos and dysfunction? Presumably if the internet is still able to function in some way then bitcoin transactions should still work it can be traded as a commodity.

Internet could still conceivably remain functional despite a societal collapse. If you think about it the underlying infrastructure isn't going to just disappear overnight, though it will degrade without maintenance/security. If companies like SpaceX with Starlink manage to pull off a high bandwidth space-based internet communication system, something like that could theoretically remain despite societal collapse (provided there are some corporations/institutions still standing in this world to maintain the infrastructure).

Any business dealing in many small transactions would be moronic to rely on btc in its current form. The system is no where near ready for that kind of thing. Fees and confirmation times are absurd.

Season and episode?

Step 1. Don't sell
Step 2. Profit

Luckily we're not forever bound to the decisions that a group of old men made 200 years ago, before the advent of electricity and the internet. 
It doesn't matter what the founding fathers wanted. 
I pray for the day that bitcoin breaks out of its libertarian, taxation-is-theft wet dream once and for all. Taxation is a necessity for any well develop nation. If you don't want to pay tax go live in a tax haven or third world country.
