at the top of my head, I'd probably so something like this: 
1. wait for some big fish (e.g. a wallet worth &gt; 500.000$)
2. load ad from https//ads.my_domain.com/static/550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000.jpg
where 550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000 is not a guid, but an encoding of your secret key or whatever. (if more entropy is needed, just load more "ads")
You can modify step 1 by adding more noise (e.g. only become active, when there are no security updates installed, or when a certain other app is installed)
You can modify step 2 by using different reason for a network-request. Maybe check for updates, or load a font. 
Or you could just say "fuck it" and just don't sent anything before a certain date, and send everything from all users after that date. 
You imagination is the only limit really

I absolutely agree.

by "avoid detection by packet sniffer" I mean "avoid detection by packet sniffer **before it's too late**". I thought that was obvious by now. 
Also you can't really call the package "detected", when you can't differentiate it from a regular package. The kind of "detection" you are talking about won't help securing your wallet.

As someone who actually has "the basic level of technical competence", let me tell you that there are a million ways avoid detection by packet sniffer
