Good job man! Not only did you bought at possibly a great low! You thinking into the future. You are patient and anyone who wants to get into an investment has to be EXTREMELY PATIENT! Not only did you see the volatility you took your time and study it even though you may have missed opportunities you still took the time to study it and waited for the greatest opportunity at this low! You're are a extremely smart man! 
Everyone stop living in fear! Yes there are people in the world that scams this and that however there is this little thing called karma that exist in this universe... What goes around will come around ��x. We all want to feel safe as human beings. We natrually don't want violence. Stop listening to fear! We must learn how to Trust again and that's a SLOWW PROCESS but we will make it in due time ⏳. Start fixing your habits and become better people. We are all evolving in a collective consciousness and understand that this is the future but in order to have a healthy world we must learn how to trust again and blockchain provides that..
we all know that you can't disclose how much bitcoins you have however we all know that Satoshi nakamoto has 980,000 he's teaching you how to be vulnerable and transparent of what he has and blockchain is transparent. It is teaching you to trust again. And also gave us a gift as a peer-to-peer system. To trust the money that we are receiving and not this counterfeit Fiat money that we have in this world.
