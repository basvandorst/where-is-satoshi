It says at the top fee free for a limited time. I guess they will garner interest and then start to charge.

Easy enough. It won't work on rooted phones though. So I had to use the wives phone. I don't bank with barcleys. It deposits a penny into your bank with a reference code that you need that was also done quite fast.

I had that happen a well a few days ago, I messaged then about it but I think it's just a Lil glitchy still

Seconds. But like I mentioned the confirmations were needed to be able to spend them. So about another 40 minutes on to of that.

That dosnt worry me to much im happy to give them my info, Just be very handy if I can walk into a branch rather than transfer from my non barcley account  as im guessing that will take a day or two.

I used it yesterday, everything went perfectly. The bitcoins appeared in my wallet near instantly and I just had to wait for verification on the blockchain.

You can also deposit money in a local branch to your pingit app from what I gather, so no need for a bank account at all. Anyone tried this yet?

soforit has to be funded with euro's now I think.

Services were growing slowly but the recent influx seemed to be a lot of people with $$ in their eyes. I have to admit I even held onto 1 coin from my last purchase to see what happened with it, but I did spend the rest. I've been using it to buy stuff only up until I set aside that 1 coin. It's still holding it's value from when I bought it  so im not to worried. I'll probably spend it soon enough once this settles down (assuming it does, im optimistic)  to give the vendors a fair chance of it keeping it's value when I do spend it rather than jumping on a bargain.

Ive been using  . You need to fund it with euro's, which can be done via   (thats my referal link, it will expose your email) which accepts debit card funding. Basically you tell transferwise to send the money to bitstamp along with the reference code bitstamp provides. It takes about 48 hours for funds to clear.
If you have any questions ask away.

Transferwise allows funding with debit cards, thats what I done last week, was quicker than logging onto my bank account and transferring from there so I thought I would try it.

That's why you backup. Do you not backup your photos as well? Same principal, if you get a new computer you transfer the photos over.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:25:32
If you use transferwise to transfer funds to a site like bitstsamp or anyother that accepts sepa transfers you can fund it with a debit card (not credit though). 
   &lt;thats my referal link, it will expose your email to me so you dont have to use it! just a warning :)
   &lt;send funds here from transferwise, takes about 48 hours in total and the fee's are pretty low.

If the road was shut down somehow, two more will pop up to replace it. There is already some alternatives out there, the road just got all the publicity. Users will migrate and use these others instead. The ball has started rolling and no government can stop it (unless they all legalize all drugs but that's not happening any time soon)

They have had other methods for a while, I buy from there because its easy to just transfer money to some random  persons bank account when I need it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:25:03
Shut it down and 2 alternatives pop up. There is already other markets starting to grow. But I dont really agree with the above posters sentiment about it being held up by the road.

good luck. your not alone, im sure quite a few people mined some early coins and have just remembered with all the recent media attention.
