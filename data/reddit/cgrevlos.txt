Ok cool, I will keep that site in mind and check it often.
As far as mining with the SHA-256, do they only mine for bitcoin? Or can they mine anything like litecoins and dogecoins too?

OK cool, maybe you could help me answer that question haha, as I'm not sure what Asics for SHA-256 even means :/
If it helps I plan on spending around $2,000, but if it needs to be more it can be.

Awesome, I really like the information here! Thanks a ton already
So for the ASIC SHA-256, would something like this be a good investment:  ?
And if so, what else would need to be purchased along with this package, as I see that it says "Plug and Play"?

Awesome thanks for those subreddits, that will be great to follow from now on!
I'm currently mining on my normal PC, just to see what it's like and what it can produce. It says I currently have 6 accepted shares, what does that mean exactly? I just started it today around 3 PM Central Time.
Also, is there any posts that you've seen come across those two subreddits that are especially helpful to newcomers? Looking at most of the posts, I realize that I don't know what most of the titles even mean haha

So that would be much better in turn for an actual profit?
