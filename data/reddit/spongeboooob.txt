The expected value is more like... $0.05 on the dollar.

"Construct a valid address" - that being a second input, or the output address?

Kano said he ain't messing with any transactions... not sure why.

It lets you import your own private keys. I made the uncompressed private key elsewhere

Doesn't work. I tried updating Electrum and tried again with both prefixes. The error is:
The following inputs could not be imported (1):
p2wpkh:(redacted)... (invalid private key: only compressed public keys can be used in segwit scripts)

I did it via a mobile wallet that only recently updated their app to deny uncompressed public keys when making segwit addresses.
How can they include my tx if I cannot even create a tx? I have the tx raw transaction info, but whatever I do, I cannot broadcast it out. Thanks for your help
Edit: Okay I was able to make a tx. Of course it doesn't show on the blockchain, so I would just go contact a pool and ask them to include it? Well wish me luck

I feel stupid, I thought this was real for a bit
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:24:35
I don't understand the last bit. Create a proper segwit address? Can you elaborate? Im willing to pay if this works

What do you mean by "learn about them". As in, I have to contact them myself?
I've done that but no luck so far
