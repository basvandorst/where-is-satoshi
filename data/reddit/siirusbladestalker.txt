Please learn about what you are talking about before posting. 4chan did not come up with dogecoin, dogecoin qt is official and secure, and cgminer is a litecoin miner with some manually added settings changed to mine doge.

And on the original, OFFICIAL website: "dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency".
Open source and secure. How hard is that to understand? its a joke, I never said it wasnt and I am not defending dogecoin as being some sort of real currency or world savior like you biasedly and blindly hold bitcoin to be. What I AM doing is defending **truth**.
