What about gold? It's not a "mathematically fixed supply", but pretty close to it (a physically limited supply with a growth rate of around 2% per year.) And I would argue that gold better fulfills the decentralised and cross-border qualities of a non-governmental currency, as bitcoin transactions are just not feasible for half of the world's population.

I can't see how bitcoins don't end up in centralized repositories. How else can be grandma be sure that her life savings doesn't end up in the hands of hackers or lost to a disk/memory failure? I think people would be more willing to take personal responsibility for safeguarding their gold than their bitcoins, thus making gold more likely to be decentralized.
By "cross-border", I wasn't thinking so much about physically transporting it across a border. I was thinking more about something that is recognizable as valuable independently of the authority and viability of any particular government.
It would be very easy to make gold fractionally transferable in satoshi-sized increments if we wanted to.
But I didn't intend to start a gold vs bitcoin debate. I think there are very good qualities to both systems that are a big improvement over the fiat money system we have. My point was that we have had an example of a decentralized, cross-border, finite currency in use for thousands of years. Bitcoin is a better currency for the digital age, but gold did serve the same role in the pre-digital age.

It seems to me that those two desires are contradictory. If bitcoin's value keeps going up by magnitudes, it won't be stable enough to become a common unit of exchange. Everybody will hoard them and never use them for day-to-day transactions. Pricing goods and services in bitcoins will be extremely difficult as vendors will be required to adjust prices daily or even hourly.
