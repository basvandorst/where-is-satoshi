oh ok
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:22:10
OK, I'll poke around a little bit :-)

Just clicked on your link. Is that a variation of bitcoin? Looking at that site hurts my eyes.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:50:37
ok thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:21:33
Thanks :-) Most people have been friendly, but there have been a few cranky folks.

giving it to a charity seems like a good way of paying it forward.  do you know of some that might accept it?
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:32:47
oh, yeah, I just created it because I was told "the people on reddit would help you"
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:41:20
Haha, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:51:31
I've never heard of Sean's Outpost, but I'd probably try to look for one that I had heard of before.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:39:21
oh, sorry, I don't know how I would make it look less fake.
thanks for the advice.  your  link doesn't seem to be working.
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:01:12
thank you :-)
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:22:22
I'll take a look, thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:08:52
:-( I just posted about getting a change tip. Sorry if I'm doing something wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:10:47
I can't believe you would give some random person $18. You just made my day!
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:28:40
I don't understand? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:41:46
Cool, I'll take a look, thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:30:00
ok, thanks for the help.  I don't have an extra $50 a week to spend but I'll keep looking around :-)
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:04:13
Holy cow! thanks buddy! :-)

Thanks! I guess now I know what the conversion rate for pizza rolls is :-P
