Mhmm, and what happens to that debt when the interest rates increase?
Or are you gonna sit here and pretend you know anything about economics and that a 1.25% interest rate is anywhere close to normal.

Lol you're either a moron or a statist weasel. 
All taxes are set by the government and go to the government. It makes no fucking difference at what point you're taxed.

You're very welcome!
Hope you enjoy it, it's a fascinating and extremely important area of study that most people know way too little about, since it's almost completely ignored by the educational system.

Pretty sure nobody considers 1.5% high, the Fed just painted itself into a corner they have no idea how to get out of with their bullshut Keynsian meddling. 
Lots of pain is coming for a ton of people. And if you think a completely speculative investment like bitcoin will be spared in the crash you're pretty delusional IMO.

If someone had been jerking you off for a decade+ would you still feel very stimulated?
The economy works similarly.
A strong economic system is one with high interest rates because that means it's actually valuable to possess money, it's worth a lot more. This in turn produces a much higher quality of borrowers on average, because they have to pay a premium.
Low interest rates = cheap money for everybody, who will use it less wisely on average. It results in an economy based on debt and inflation; immense debt in USA's case. It's not sustainable. 
There's a 10 hour video on YouTube, it's the audio version of the book 'Basic Economics' by Thomas Sowell, an incredible resource. I highly recommend you start there if you're eager to learn.

Except if things go according to that plan, "who" has them become the new tyrants...

You think debt decreases when interest rates go up? Oh boy.....
We'd be paying billions if not a trillion+ for the interest on the debt alone if interest rates were at normal level, you dumbass lol. 
And how the fuck would a country owe itself? It owes the Fed, which is a private institution, as well as China, and other nations around the world.
Go read an Economics book before you spew bullshit.

Right, that's what I was saying...

Blackjack and poker aren't 100% luck either, but they both sure are gambling. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:34:54
You're absolutely right that they're all a gamble, but they're not equal gambles.

Most people regard ponzi schemes as scams.

You might want to look up what the interest rates have been historically and reevaluate your ridiculous statement lol

Drugs are more of a currency in that trade than Bitcoin is. 
The dealer had to make an extra trade by immediately switching the bitcoin to a real currency, while the user kept the drugs because they're actually valuable to him.
