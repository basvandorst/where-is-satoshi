Is China buying when they wake up?

Next thing we know China unbans everything.

Calling me dummy will ensure no proof is given. I THINK does not equate to I am correct 
I want to be wrong here everyone. But I think I am onto something. I would be right if when China fully regulates and reopens exchanges etc the rapid rally continues.
I am merely trying to start a discussion here

I can give more details later but earlier this year around march-may the market cap for crypto increased drastically. I remember reading something regarding China beginning to open a lot more exchanges buying a lot. Can anyone shed some light?
So as a result of these China bans be it temporary or permanent the price should eventually stabilise to before they pumped it up.

Volume doesn't mean anything in this case. People like to state how low it is but think outside the box for a moment.

Are Chinese people not able to use poloniex or any non china based exchanges? 
People crying about the price dropping is not going to resolve anything.
