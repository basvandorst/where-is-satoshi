How do I buy crypto, and how much money do I need for this?
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:15:18
If you make sense, I might try it.
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:49:48
Basically, I just want to understand it. I just want to be informed, rather than being overwhelmed with it, which is the way it is going as it looks.... I appreciate all the help of course. This is the ONLY thread ever on Reddit where I am getting that many (helpful) feedback (which is strange).
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:44:20
Sure, but how can a private individual who doesn't have the financial resources (as yet) or expertise take the security measures a bank would take?
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:09:21
How can I sell IOU tickets to shiny rocks?
I am not as good as bankers are, I am a total newbie.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:04:57
Basically, the one question I want to ask right now is this: how will Bitcoin help me be my own bank?
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:36:44
I have not the slightest intention of rushing. I might try some of the advice given here if it makes sense to me but basically my post should be considered as an expression of curiosity - as theoretical. You know, like: suppose I want to be my own bank, what do I have to do?
 I'd just like to better understand it - but not to say I am averse to the idea of actually trying it.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:07:10
You are the stuff dictators are made of.
@_date: 2018-09-26 10:53:54
Of course I don't know enough. This is, totally coincidentally of course, also the reason why I was asking this question in the first place.
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:07:55
Did you mean to say;: why link work that not for me does?
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:45:24
Should I take this seriously?
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:52:02
Thks for your reply.
Hmmm.... if I can't use my regular computer, what do you suggest?
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:39:58
It's all indeed somewhat confusing, particularly the principles on which Bitcoin is based. I always heard money should be based on a gold standard, that's why the US has Fort Knox.
Bitcoin has nothing of the sort, if I understand right it's even completely virtual - there are no actual coins or notes, are there?
So actually this high-tech 'currency' is as ephemeral as electrons flowing through wires.
@_date: 2018-09-26 10:55:01
What do you mean good thinking - being your own bank? To be honest I have no idea what sort of thinking it is. I hope it's good.
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:35:00
Thanks for that link. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:02:02


Got it!
Thanks for your extensive reply.
I absolutely agree it's OK to be a noob (don't we all start out like that) but there are those hateful characters who will call you a troll for it, as you may have noticed.
@_date: 2018-09-26 10:55:26
Can you lend me the money?
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:06:41
How can I use it in a supermarket or in a Pizza Hut? Or in a KFC....
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:55:28
Thanks, I'll have to look more into it later. Things like "full node" and such....
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:11:29
Did my reply make you feel I am an asshole?
Well, sorry for that. I don't know what I may have said which made you reply this way. There was no malice intended in my reply. And to be sure I am not familiar with the issues your standard American commonly might have.
Edit: what is it? Saying shooting bubbles is more fun than bitcoin makes me an asshole?
Edit2: I'd like to know why first I am called an asshole, after a totally friendly seeming exchange, and then being downvoted for asking *why* you call me an asshole?
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:10:12
No way. How long does Bitcoin exist now? Not far from a decade, I bet.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:11:13
I don't get it. What is mycelium, and why would anyone send me free bitcoin? I am not begging nor panhandling.
@_date: 2018-09-28 20:28:52
Related to bitcoin?
A person can have, and usually has, severals goals.
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:42:20
Thanks, sounds like good advice. But I'm not trying to have fun here. If I were, I would be busy shooting bubbles. You should try it some time. I am sure it's more fun than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:00:35
Thanks for your reply. I didn't read through it yet, but one question I think of is - assuming the risk of being a bank naturally also entails taking some security measures, wich as a private individual doesn't seem very doable.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:46:24
Thanks for these probably very useful tips. But I'll have to study a first* things first before actually understanding what they mean...
Of course I do understand what "not running MS Windows" means, haha... and I do know about Tor.
Edit (*) "first a few"
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:47:57
Doesn't sound like I will be doing this any time soon. I don't even know the first thing about Bitcoin (well, actually I do know it starts with a "B" and also it is based on a thing known as a blockchain) and I don't have the financial means, so intellectual satisfaction is the primary thing I am looking for right now I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:07:29


See, there you already lost me. I am sorry but this will have to take some time.
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:07:21
These items - in that order?
And what does hodl mean?
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:30:27
@_date: 2018-09-29 05:26:07
I am new to bitcoin, that's right. Not new to this world, to computers or to the internet.
I don't see why you have a problem with my "keeping saying" I want to be my own bank. I only said that once besides, AFAIK in the title.
There is nothing to figure out. What I wanted to know, I asked in the thread. If you have any info to offer, I'm interested and grateful (not as much as if you'd saved my life but still).
I'll look at that link, thanks. It's all a matter of having the time.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:02:58
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:08:22
Whay does this imply, and how do I do it?
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:52:58
In some way this sounds like sound advice (thanks) but not in a way I am able to make use of right now. You have to realize I really know very very little about this (of course you could say the time I am spending in this thread I could have used to look things up).
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:14:06
I am not familiar enough with it to understand it all but this seems good info, thanks.
This looks better than penny stocks.
But what good does sending around 5 or 10$ worth of bitcoin do (remember, I am a total noob)?
Edit: this webpage seems to imply you are a broke mindless crypto sheep!
@_date: 2018-09-25 12:05:34
I do like reading, but :
"requested URL not found on this server"
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:49:50
You'd have to be an expert to be able to correctly evaluate any of these 3 items. Of course, you could just flip a coin as far as the 1st item is concerned.
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:21:36


Oh OK, thks. Like "pwn".
You should try writing a Bitcoin 101 (I think this is how you call it in the US?).
@_date: 2018-09-26 11:08:15
Go away.
Edit: or did you mean u/tungfa?
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:44:10
It does *look* insane if you are leaving something out. And my guess is you are leaving something out.
It would be insane for an individual, but I am pretty sure banks have more means at their disposal than individuals.
@_date: 2018-09-26 10:51:46
Ah thanks. What is a C/P file BTW? Copy-paste?
