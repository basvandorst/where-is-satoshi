u/anderson-pope where are you? I'm beginning to get worried! I hope you and your son are alright. And don't worry, I won't forget about you. I'm still here waiting...

He literally said, "I come back for every dip". That's a literal quote. Now, we all know this bro is not a time traveler. But he 100% answered your question. You just have to concede on that one.

Yep, middle aged; had much more aggressive portfolio when younger. Have progressively shifted percentage of risk lower as I've aged. Still maintain some high risk traditionals like biotech, mostly for fun. Bulk is now in index/moderate risk ETF's. Not interested in touching how I run those investments for now, so crypto is just an add on. One word of advice to take or leave--capital gains are a bitch, so you may look at how you design your portfolio to account for this. Happy to discuss more via DM if you're interested.

"Fundraising" for "something important"? 
Yeah, sure...Bitcoin or not, of course it's perfectly normal and expcted that people will give money to strangers who won't tell you what it's for.  No wonder you're indignant. /s ��

I'll help you out. Just message me a pic of you, with your son, in the hospital--holding a sign with my username on it. Also include in the message your real name, address and phone number.  I'll be waiting on the edge of my seat.

Who STILL rely on fiat? So, basically you're asking who 99.9% of the US population trusts for banking. For me, I'm still with the same bank I've been with for decades. Nothing special, just the banking equivalent of a "big box" store. I've got multiple accounts and no fees due to size of average balances. They have a reasonably good app and lots of locations. It's fine.

Unclear on why this would be good advice at all. Retirement planning 101--shift portfolio into lower risk holdings. Moving assets into Bitcoin at his age makes no sense. Unless, of course, you're looking down the pipeline to an inheritance?
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:07:53
The negative comments have nothing to do with keeping "old people" from learning about technology, but are about time tested money management strategies based on age. The OP came back and provided information that, if taken at face value, suggests that his grandfather's investment in a speculative asset is inconsequential due to his grandfather being a multimillionaire. That's fine, but it does not change or invalidate the premise that highly volatile investments in retirement are generally a poor idea.

Something Awful is a website that used to be relevant. Founded by Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka. They have forums, in which people would ridicule Bitcoin. The forum fee was $10. Purchased at $0.25/Bitcoin, that would have gotten you 40 Bitcoins; close to half a million dollars at today's prices.

Hi! So, you'll see I mentioned both the idea that we don't know how much Bitcoin they own, and also the vulnerability to hacking. Separate and equally concerning issues--and both taken together just highlight how little is actually known about what's going on behind the scenes at RH. Remember that EXTREMELY long crypto disclaimer/TOS they had you sign? I actually read it. Basically, they could have summed it up by saying they aren't responsible for anything. And of course they would want to avoid a disastrous scandal; I think all exchanges would want this, but that alone doesn't actually ensure they're immune to a hack. This is just some additional food for thought; people do all kinds of things that others wouldn't do, or would recommend against (like storing on exchanges). You just need to decide what works for you!
Revised to amend that it's not clear if you've purchased on RH already. If not, I recommend reviewing the crypto TOS. Set aside at least a half an hour.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:55:19
Full transparency, I'm in the process of liquidating minimal crypto holdings on RH; have a cold storage hardware wallet ready to go for future purchases on Coinbase Pro. I get where you're coming from, but the more I read the more I realized the importance of actually owning my own Bitcoin, whether I plan to use it for transactions or not.
 Is it possible RH could go under and leave people holding the bag? It sure is. Cryptocurrency holdings on RH do not have any protections; "regular" stock purchases on RH are protected, but not crypto. 
There's also a question about how much Bitcoin RH holds. A significant call could leave you or others in trouble. 
And lastly, the possibility of any exchange (RH included) getting hacked is real. And again, no protections. 
For a minimal investment of money and time spent learning, I can feel much more secure about my investment by being responsible for my own Bitcoin; you'll need to make the call on what level of risk works for you. Good luck!

It seems you didn't carefully read my post, which referenced the larger picture of retirement investing, not this particular instance. I stand by my my assessment, and feel confident in my knowledge. Have a great evening!

As someone with family in the automotive business,  I 100% agree that cash deals are not particularly appealing to dealerships, who make much more money when you bring a trade and take financing. If this is a very low production/ultra-luxury/high cachet automaker, they MAY have some interest in the advertising/press value, but Bitcoin for a Sentra probably isn't going to get any traction.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:43:14
The most underrated part of this entire thread is how seriously people are taking him, when we all know this dude is not a time traveler. Just totally in stride, "oh, the Bitcoin Time Traveler is back, hey bro, what's new? I've got questions for you." Doesn't matter that this is all completely bogus, we're just going to roll with it ��

He should immediately cease investing and read. Learn. Follow this sub for a while. Ask more questions. Read more. Otherwise I think it's all going to end badly, one way or another.

No specific weekday for me. I'm planning to approach it slightly differently, have a set amount I'm going to DCA per week (better than monthly I think, given high volatility) but will watch prices carefully and set a limit order based on what I think we might see given current trends, subject to revision. If it gets close to the end of the week and limit order hasn't been filled, I'll just go ahead at current price. I'm also going to buy significantly larger amounts if we see a large retreat. I'm trying to ultimately get 5-10% of my portfolio into Bitcoin, so I've got a ways to go and not in a particular hurry, but want to take advantage where I can.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:48:01

Hello?! Concerned that it's now apparently been two days since you've seen your son! Waiting...
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:01:19
Currently I'm waiting on my transfer from bank to Coinbase Pro to drop (should happen early this week). I'm going to try to maximize to the best of my ability...so basic plan is buy from Coinbase during dips and sell on RH during upticks. I have some other (minimal) stock on RH, so I'll probably load those with the $ from Bitcoin liquidation and then eventually sell everything and move that lump sum to Coinbase. Once that's done I'm going to just DCA and hodl!

You've been banging your anti-Bitcoin drum for quite some time. It's rather boring and not particularly relevant. It's not your responsibility to try to persuade anyone with your "sky is falling" mentality, just sit back quietly and watch it burn if that's what floats your boat.
