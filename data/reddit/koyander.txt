It is waste of time, Loop is not a easy trading methods, only if buyer agrees then you can sell to him her.

And Bitcoin said....Thank you for your extended support infinitely!
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:31:53
Funny though...that we don't know who the whales are, that packs everyone's wallet and control the market pricing and bomb when time is right.
@_date: 2018-08-04 16:14:36
Limited in numbers...how can it become a currency? Whales will become god and start controlling the world itself!
Stop this false and fake research!
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:07:04
Things were different back then...back then there was no bank issues, govt directives, no banning, not many hacks, scams but now it is the reality, Bitcoin is suffering from setbacks, govts having issues, banks having discomfort, exchanges getting hacked, whales playing gods so there is a serious concerns for future of Bitcoin.

By Fiat currency hoarders
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:00:20
No...but Bitcoin is being exploited by untrusted and illigal ways of trading.
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:40:00
Precisely, Bitcoin is being bought by black money hoarders, they're buying it off with pure cash, seller if BTC is exercising it...I have personally come across a friend's friend doing this!! 
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:37:31
Bitcoin trading in India is exchanging black money for Bitcoin, it's like an asset.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:19:17
Precisely, there are millions who are hodling since 2017, some who bought at 18k !!
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:50
Coinbase didn't crash, they just stopped people from selling... slowing further crash
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:00:50
Thanks for being honest
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:07:11
Nah, sold everything back in 2018 Jan before financial budget, as predicted it all got fked up, it is pretty clear everyone for name sake say HODL but they want to exchange for fiat profits!
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:13:48
Fuking insane, not good at all...
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:31
You shot have hodl, but I know you will again purchase as it keeps rising.
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:34:08
Which reminds me...flaws and exchange hacks back in 2017 - 2018 or was that an organised crime to sell out BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:53:47
That will never happen in my sure view, mass is as always diverted with their lively hood, work, commitment and more over most of them are either middle class or lower so much organized movement won't be happening unless there is a civil war breakout like the yellow vest for example, govt will never want to lose control and besides the military is on their side but aid people only during disaster, do you agree?
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:55:48
You are on the truth man! I consider BTC to Gold, you just can't trade it like gold, too rare, expensive, delicate as you could lose it to fraudsters.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:46:05
Do you really believe nation's govt would want to replace banks with BTC which only whales control, manipulate market, limited in numbers. I seriously doubt this ever becoming mainstream.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:48:45
@_date: 2019-04-06 08:07:21
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:54:01
Some day, when dollar collapses but would your BTC be enough for survival?
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:51:43
A BTC trading machine was installed near an airport here...it was taken away by cops because it is illigal in my country.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:48:27
Nice, looks to me like you are gambling on crypto exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:50:00
I never bought any but invested in alt coins with 10% profit and withdrawn before I was going to lose it all.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:22:54
If you sold at 20k then yeah...not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:15:29
Enough with BS, hodling is only leaving people to more losses, only way BTC will regain new and correct value is when it drops to lowest and begins to gain it's actual value as of today's situation.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:36:17
Arrest that fucking bastard
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:00:24
There's a lot of stress when buying cryptos, me and my bro couldn't sleep during the surge and just when it began to drop, we sold off before any investment loss and came out before things got dirty, I hate those whales who fucked the crypto exchange and left with very huge profits.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:20
You don't know the meaning of 3rd world countries, educate yourself first.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:52:46
Long term? Yes even I would buy and keep some but not for regular trading/gambling.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:26:16
You're right... these people telling to HODL, telling good days are ahead are joking..
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:59:16
Many don't have a home of their own and you have given up yours in a belief that Bitcoin will resolve your hopes was a very unintelligent thing to do' this is my thought.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:01:56
They have not banned Bitcoin or Crypto Trading but they are instructing banks to stop working with exchange...people cannot do proper deposits or withdrawal..how can this be just FUD? and accounts get noticed for closure because of money transactions between account and exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:49:17
I suspected something like this to happen, I convinced myself to sell off and come out of cryptos in Feb soon after financial budget was given by Jaitley and since then there have been only decline in prices of crypto currency particularly in Indian crypto exchange, today I see them drop by 22 - 30% even the courageous one has decide to sell and secure his investment.
