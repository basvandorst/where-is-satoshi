It should be listed on the TSXV exchange, so if your broker has access to this exchange, you can purchase it. most european and north americain brokers have access. but you'll likely need Canadian dollars to buy shares.

I already agreed to buy this from u/hoopinkid , I sent the bitcoin payment today. he then said the UPS store was closed and that he would ship it tommarow. He has since deleted our reddit conversation, and made this post. my side of the conversation is still available, so ill post that soon along with the bitcoin transaction ID for the record. Do not buy anything from this guy.

also, blockchain.info is down, here's a working link

but the weird thing is that the indictment transaction example had two amounts being sent. one was to another party I assume, while the other was back to the same original address as a change address. do most wallets use the same address as a change address? which wallets do? that's defiantly a good question to have answered...

fun game, just needs more players in the paying playgrounds. there's usually a couple people playing in the faucet.

wish they'd payout more and have more game modes in the paid playground.
