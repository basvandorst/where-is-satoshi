I don't see it as "letting" anyone do anything. I don't consider myself authoritative or powerful enough to stop them. I'm saying that I recognize manipulation will happen in any environment but it's best to be aware and educated so we don't get manipulated as severely. That being said, I think the technology will level a lot of playing fields for people financially. 
I also want food on my table, which is why I recommended that we do what we can as a community to see through the games, stand behind the technology (not just the excitement behind financial performance against your fiat currency), and educate those around us. 
I'm encouraging us to be a more informed group, not to ignore what's going on in Lalaland. I don't care about b*cash/Roger/pick your "bad guy" in the same way I don't care about investment banks. I might/might not want what they're investing in, but I know they want to scalp me either way. So I plan and act accordingly, try to read between the lines, know the facts, etc so manipulation has a minimized impact on me personally

About 5 years. I actually bought mine through Mt Gox back then

You're my kinda person. I'll download the book today. I'm halfway through "mastering bitcoin" but do not have a developer-mindset by nature so I struggle with it a bit conceptually. Like all things, studying is how you learn. I welcome any sources of knowledge as I prefer to teach myself. Thank you kind sir/madam

No. In the scope of my life, this has always - and continues to be - a small portion of my investments. Bitcoin doesn't show up regularly as a topic at all in the realms I generally operate

Thank you. I realize there are extreme views one way or the other about every topic. I figured this community is a place where I could get more sound discussion and answers. Just trying to understand the system that everyone here is very passionate about.

In fairness to me, I've been reading things advising me against it for maybe 3 days. I've held coin for upwards of 5 years

Awesome, thank you!
