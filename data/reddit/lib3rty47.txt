No country can ban bitcoin. China can declare it banned as many times as it wants but its a globally decentralized network that will still continue amongst its people. Drugs and guns are banned in most countries and they still find its way in circulation and governments spend millions on trying to enforce this ban. How would they succeed in something decentralised and digital? You would have to shut down the internet or blanket your entire country of it. You would need to buy the remaining amount of bitcoin, but that would only make the price skyrocket and legitimise it as a currency. On top of all this, other countries have been developing blockchain technology while yours has fallen behind, your currency hyper inflated and your citizens fleeing your country.

this will cause a price drop cause you made bitcoin less scarce, THANKS A-HOLE! /s

Ideally the bitcoin community would want to sell products for bitcoin to pay their employees in bitcoin so they can buy other things with bitcoin. Why go through the hassle of converting and converting back. You print emails just to fax/mail them do u?

Sorry I can't buy that, the cost of toilet paper cost more than our car. You can use Bolivar paper found on the streets of Venezuela.

This stat doesnt matter. Its all relative to when the person bought and if/when the person sells.

I love bitcoin but I hate this sub. How many times must we see this post. How many people actually believe this logic. Ive watch this sub become nothing but price memes and pictures of stickers and ATMs in god knows where locations. So sad.

**U.S.  President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve should  lower U.S. interest rates to "zero or less" to help "refinance our debt"  with lower interest costs and a longer term, and blamed the U.S.  central bank's chief for missing "A once in a lifetime opportunity".**
**"The  USA should always be paying the ... lowest rate. No Inflation! It is  only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't  allow us to do what other countries are already doing," Trump wrote in a  pair of early morning tweets.**
What would that mean for the bitcoin community?

Its all just to get ad revenue. I honestly think all these articles don't even have a ounce of research behind them, these writers could care less if it goes up or down. I seen the same writers claim its going to the moon the day btc bounces back. They just write up click-bait headlines to collect their ad revenue.

I stand and clap for this man. Screw all of you thinking this was a bad decision, this man is a pioneer. If no one uses BTC whats the point? Guess what we go back to ZERO!

He is trying to find a short term solution for the stagnant economy caused by the trade war and coming recession talks. With negative interest rates the public have no need to put money in savings. They'll put in the market causing stocks to boom, making it seem he solved the doubting markets during his term in office. But what will really happen is the prices of everything will skyrocket to meet demand until it stagnates and then cycle continues in a faster rate, each cycle decreasing the value of the dollar until.. Well, look at Venezuela when their dollar had no value

The fact we are waiting to see whether quantum computing or cryptocurrency reach mass adoption is amazing. What a time to be alive. And other technologies too, like general artificial intelligence, fusion reactors and other fundamental humanity changing technologies

This plan will backfire more than it will help you. If you want more bitcoin and plan to hodl just buy and don't sell. Put in whatever you can afford to lose after every paycheck and buy no matter what price.

What an age we live in. Quantum Computing, Decentralized banking, Renewable Engery, Deep learning AI. 
Which ever technology matures first will be a huge breakthrough for humanity.
