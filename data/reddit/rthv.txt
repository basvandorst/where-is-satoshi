Because sometimes the current reality includes no ideal option. As dumb as adults can be on average, children are much more so. That's reality. Giving some "whips" to individual parents is much better than other means of saving the stupidest (*on average*) and most important part of society from itself. If that's what you're into.

You must be so fucking angry at your parents for retrieving you when you decided to run away in kindergarten. You keep your name calling *right here*.

I do think if I was a dangerously naive 33 year old's parent I'd wanna limit his freedom to do seek particularly reckless dangers as much as I could. Children are not slaves and trust in their abilities should correspond to freedom you give them. You could be a delusional parent of a mature teen and oppress him, fortunately government (ha) would be obliged to stop you if you cross certain lines and in a few years you'd have no legal authority whatsoever over him. We weren't talking about local coffee shop dangers, cheap shot.

If you don't trust your kid at 15 it *might* mean you weren't parenting well enough (not necessarily, the best can have bad luck), but what you are saying is essentially if you failed at a certain age, just give up and stop with the parenting. Why is 15 so special for you, why not make it 12? 
After all using the same logic, if you don't trust your kid at 12 that means you've got &lt;3 years before it's supposed to be 15 which is * your* approved age to let it do whatever idiotic thing sounds like a good idea to him/her at the time.
18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3? You just put an arbitrary line and said fuck it, you failed as a parent now step aside. What can kill you is *not* a good learning experience. Neither is what can permanently harm you and even psychologically scar you (yes mental illnesses exist). Parents have a role, seeing them as oppressors who should step away is as stupid as seeing government as an oppressor that should just be killed off... oh wait this is just gonna get downvoted.

I made an argument against bashing parents for *trying to parent*. Where did I say anything about private property? I'm saying there should be some enforced authority over children and you assume it's all about maintaining an arbitrary status quo.
That was so pointless.
