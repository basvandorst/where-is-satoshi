Or ethereum :)

I think the bubble will grow to at least 25k before the pop.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:18:27
You definitely can. Lots of online stores take Bitcoin (Newegg, Microsoft, Expedia), you can buy gift cards, or you can get a debit card that can be used anywhere any other debit card can be used.
On top of all that you can easily sell Bitcoin for USD.
Don't get me wrong though, I agree it's going to crash. Maybe down to 3 or 4k.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say, tech stocks are many times higher than at the peak of the bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:25:19
Me too. I want to be part of the 21 million club.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:58
It does feel like a bubble, but I'm not selling my coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:43:48
Now your hate is directed!
I play games during the day and mine at night while I sleep. I highly recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:53:33
I really hope you're right, it would give do many a chance to but some cheap coins :)

So two things - 
1. no Bitcoin miners use GPUs.
2. GPUs pay for themselves. They're basically free now. 
I now have one 1080 and two 1070s that have all paid for themselves. Because if this recent jump in Bitcoin price (I mine alts and sell for BTC) I'm going to buy two more 1070s.
Get as mad as you want but I'm telling you they're free now, and I'm going to keep buying them with my mining profits.

I'm confused, doesn't the USD keep going down in price? So currencies with a limited supply go up when compared?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:50:33
I remember bubble talk au $1
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:29:32
It's a meme 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:28:20
Most of the people that believe in Bitcoin aren't so easily persuaded against it.
A correction is coming, it always does, but it won't tend towards 0.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:32:13
99% they already know
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:21:23
Also you can get Bitcoin debit cards, which can be used anywhere you use your regular debit card.
It's not hard to spend Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:20:25
My prediction is 25k then a big crash to 4k. Screen cap this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:59:56
I was mad at first until I realized now GPUs pay for themselves. I stared mining and paid for it my 1080 in 6 months.
It didn't make graphics cards expensive, it made them free.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:10:06
Why? Seems like a good way to get away from the feed
Federal reserve. The current bubble needs to pop, probably down to 3 or 4k...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:51:58
Hopefully soon, I want more coins
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:30:40
Look at bitcoins history. Every time the price jumps it eventually corrects. This time will be no different.
The only question is how high will it go before the correction. My guess is 25k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:15:08
It's great for buying drugs, tax evasion, and money laundering lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:23:05
It's easy to spend / sell Bitcoin. I do think a large correction is coming though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:13:57
Totally a bubble. Bitcoin always crashes. It crashed from 30 to 2. It crashed from 120 to 30. It crashed from 1200 to 300. It will crash again. Then go up again.

r/Bitcoin 2031 I have 0.000001 Bitcoin, it cost a lot but I'm excited!
