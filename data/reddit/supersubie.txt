Tried to google the answer to this but didnt seem to find anything relevant. Could you explain how you will earn BTC through a lightning node? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:02:17
Haha thank you! Its such an awesome material to make clothing from. super soft, durable and really eco friendly!

I'm pretty sure that's the point of the gif? Its a totally stable pint of beer attached to a guy dancing around. He is saying even with all the uncertainty and bumpiness in the news the price has remained stable.

Haha you're in for a hell of a ride 
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:51:57
That GIf tho
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:40:59
its pretty popular, it operates on trade ins and second hand electronics. They give you great value for money when you bring stuff to sell them and even greater value when you trade in for in store credit. It has quite a few branches across the UK and since Game went into administration this is one of the last big highstreet electronics and gaming shops left, that I know of anyway.

Its right up their street! Awesome work mate, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes me wonder what kind of crazy uses bitcoin is going to find itself enabling in a few years time.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:32:20
Brilliant thank you! This right here is why i need to fund my changetip account haha!

The rubble is dropping like a ton of bricks and I was wondering if we are begging to see any uptick in adoption within Russia of bitcoin as a hedge against the falling value. 
Are the on ramps in Russia to bitcoin anywhere near good enough to make this a viable option for people worrying about their decreased purchasing power?

Huh you learn something new every day I guess. Next time someone tries to hand me Scottish monopoly money at work I am going to have a riot with this haha! 
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:13:58
glad im not the only one who was unnerved by this!
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:12:48
Thank you its really encouraging to hear people like the work im doing only just started out! I will definitely accept BTC for a shirt to ship to the Netherlands! I will PM you when its up and running! 
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:54:20
Hey I ended up going with bitpay thanks for the help! If you fancy a shirt come be my first BTC customer!

I couldn't watch it, this guy slams his head side to side way to much for my liking! 
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:46:38
I would simply refuse to send them money any other way other than btc. Seems they are very capable of understanding money exchange and its just a force of habit that they don't want to use btc so they put no
 actual effort into understanding it.
Might seem harsh but to me its your money that you are sending they should be grateful to accept it any way you send it! 
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:55:52
Finally topped it up! $1 on me Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:14:46
Brilliant thank you! I am leaning towards them so far they seem to be the easiest to integrate with shopify as you already said! 
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:31:42
Huh what do you mean Scottish bank notes are not legal tender in England? If you have Scottish bank notes they are accepted in the whole of the UK and no one can reffuse to accept them as payments for goods or services,  because they are still made by the bank of England and are very much legal tender in the uk. It's all still the GBP 
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:11:19
Yes I was looking at bitpay as I like the option to keep a % in BTc and cash out the rest! Also I use shopify for my store and as someone has said already they are already easily integrated into Shopify! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:01:42
Thank you, do you have any experience with accepting bitcoin for products? I want to speak with someone who has before so I can get a feel for the risks and drawbacks!
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:24:53
Yea I just dont understand why these "industry leaders" don't slap it down hard. All you have to say is look guys much more crime is paid for in USD as paying in cash is untraceable why the hell would you want to commit massive frauds and crimes with bitcoin when its all directly traceable and audit-able
