'At the time of the fork'
So yes. 
If you had .5 Bitcoin on August 1, 2017, you got 0.5 free BCH.

Ho much work would it be to change it so it it works with Bitcoind directly?
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:40:32
I'm really sorry for you but this again shows how bad the whole change address part is. It causes more trouble than benefits. Over and over again.
Change addresses are confusing, create problems and limit features (like transactions fees based on a % of the transaction amount).
And besides that, change addresses hardly add anything to the privacy part. The reason they were implemented.
Here is a very interesting article about change addresses:

If your point 2 and 3 are true, then it doesn't really matter other than convenience, transaction fees etc.
But if the BTC is worth $100K, then most likely something else is wrong.
It depends on what the reason is for the BTC to be worth $100K. And the BTC value depends on the point of view.
If the $ is falling like crazy because of some crisis, the value of $100K doesn't mean much. Especially if the BTC value didn't change against the Euro (for example).
If for this reason the BTC is worth $100K, I for sure don't want $'s anymore.

All FUD.
Bitcoin is unregulated and not controlled by any government by design. Due to the Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; Fiat bridge, exchanges will be regulated by trust and reputation. The bad will automatically filter out.
You wanted this. That's why you were interested in Bitcoins.
Stop crying. You can't have it both ways.
If you want regulated, go trade on a regular stock exchange or Forex.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:18:57
This is not going to work.
The block chain cannot be used to trade (too slow). Trading with multisig cannot be used either. 
For example, what if my short is executed because it went the wrong way. I simply don't sign. Meaning, I back out.
So not for trading. 
Maybe for exchanges like localbitcoins.
But in all, you're shifting the trust. You're not eliminating it.
Bitcoin is decentralized by design. It is based on trust and reputation. The bad ones (Gox etc.) will automatically filter out and the good ones will remain. 
There is a good solution for holding the users BTCs. Exchanges can show proof that every user is accounted for. In case of trouble, notaries can step in and handle it. 
As for fiat, that can only be done by publishing audits done by respected parties like PWC, Delloyd, KPMG etc.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:51:59
I don't understand. The exchange itself, the matching engine, the trading etc. has nothing to do with deposits/withdrawals. By sticking to the standards, this whole MtGox fuckup would most likely not have happened.
Writing your own bitcoind is asking for trouble. Unless there is a reason the HAVE to. I just wonder why? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:20:08
If I can deposit and withdrawal $'s with that system, ti has volume and moms and pops find it easy to use, I will for sure look into it. 
In the meantime, I'm afraid that's the gap the current exchanges are filling.

Not only don't they get paid, they also have to pay a chargeback fee. That can go up to $25 per TX. When above .x% of CB's, they need to file Chargeback reduction plans etc.
And the problem is not only with stolen CC's. It's 'Friendly Fraud'. 
If I order BTC, then I call Visa stating I never got them. Due to consumer protection, he can fight the chargeback whatever he wants but if I state i didn't get them, it's end of story.
Even if he uses Verified by Visa, 3D Secure, whatever... the consumer is always right.
No, this is not going to work.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:38:06
Maybe interesting for an exchange but not for trading. Way too slow and bitcoins being returned if you're too late?
I don't see that happening.
Better way to go is multisig.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:24:48
I'm 100% sure this happened on BTC-e a few months ago. I don't know about today but I was surprised to see this.
Cryptsy does as well.

Regulations are great, aren't they?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:08:50
Doesn't matter.
We all knew Mark. That didn't help.
It's about trust and reputation. BTCE has reputation. Gox didn't.

I think it's this guy on Keiser Report from December 10, 2013.
Basically he said the same back then. Smart guy but we're 3 months further already.
He talks at 22:30 about Cyprus and the plans.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:07:39
Congrats. But not so interesting. That was the address to show he had control.
There are tons of addresses like this as well:
The amounts often show some bored accountant doing weird amounts. Like 57.575757 etc.

POS developers, Bitpay etc most likely prevent double spending by having a service that is connected to as much nodes as possible.
When the taxidriver has been paid, it takes a few seconds to see if the transactions is on the network and everything looks ok. If 90% of the nodes received the transaction AND there is no other transaction spending from the same output, there shouldn't be any reason to wait for the confirmations. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:06:54
I get that but why do the wallets have to create different change addresses by default? 
I mean, if the default would be that the change goes back to the original address it came from, that would already solve a lot of these issues.
People that want to use a different change address can then do that. More as an optional feature instead of a default behavior.
Like a lot of other things are optional. Multisig, zero fees etc. If someone wants to do that, no problem. I think that also should be the case for using a different change address. But by default, it should go back to the address it came from.

"we believe it necessary to confirm and improve the information we hold on all customers using or having used BitInstant in the past."
How would they know who is using or having used BitInstant in the past??
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:35:31
It's all about the volume an exchange has.
The higher the volume, the higher the fees.
In order to get volume, exchange lower their fees.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:15:12
You can't do trading otherwise. Or maybe you know something nobody else does.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:33:34
Seems to me that it's not 'resetting' every month. It calculated what you did the last 30 days.
So if you keep going and stay above 100BTC, you stay at 0%.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:30:14
'It wasn't me' or 'I don't recognize that' doesn't work with 3D Secure or Verified by Visa, Securepay or whatever the names are. 
'I never received the goods' works. And if you say you didn't, there is no way the merchant can fight the CB. Doesn't matter how much IP addresses, blockchain proof or even contracts the merchant has.
Visa will refund the money and the merchant is stuck with the bill and a chargeback fee. 
Above 0.x%, the merchant has a serious issue. Depending on the bank, he needs to file CB reduction plans and explain how he is going to reduce the CB rate. Next time he goes over the adjusted rate, he's out and on VISA's/MC's blacklist. 
Apart from that, if they find out they do BTC, they're out right away. It's considered currency exchange and not allowed.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:40:17
Not even that. 
Visa/MC will consider it as currency exchange and that is not allowed. Unless you are a registered financial institution, have the appropriate PCI compliance, MSB licenses etc.

Show source. Or Show headers. Or show raw format. Depends on your email client.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:21:33
No. There are several solutions. 
- Getting an extra chain by pruning the BC with old transactions so that it only contains the bit coins that haven't been spend yet. The complete block chain is still there but optional.
- Wallets can just keep only the headers and even drop all the info of the transactions that doesn't concern the user.
If you're looking for an Achilles heel, it's about the maximum transactions per second. I think it's currently 10tps or so. But this will be an easy change as well.
A more fundamental issue is the time it takes for the confirmations to come in. That makes it difficult for retailers to accept transactions. Somehow they need to wait for 6 confirmations and that takes time. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:45:21
"Exchanges make money off filled orders"
Just to confirm... Is this true?
It seems to me as if the majority of the exchanges charge the fee at the moment the order was placed. Meaning, if you cancel the order, you lost the fee.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:38:46
"Oversight" they call it.
Bitcoin: Decentralized and not government controlled.
There goes the free market.

I can't find the book on Amazon.
Where is it?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:59:17
I'm trying to understand how this works. Can someone explain or point me to an eli5 source?
Is the 'address' somehow multi-signature? Or the 'transaction' from one address to another?
If the address is multi signature, does that mean someone else can normally deposit to it but in order to transfer out, a predefined m-n setup is needed?
Is this supported by all miners? Can there also be (for example) a 7-10 setup?
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:36:02
lol. No thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:09
It should but I doubt if this is really happening.
If placing and canceling orders is free, it's way too easy to fuck up the order book as well.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:21:53
If a person claims that the goods are not delivered with a card-not-present transaction (i.e.. the card wasn't swiped), then there are no questions asked and a chargeback is issued. 
This consumer protection also applies for pre-paid cards including AMEX.
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:48:39
Is that the VISA and MC logo displayed there? So BTC can be bought using Credit Card? Interesting....
