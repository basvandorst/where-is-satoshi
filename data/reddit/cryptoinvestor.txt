OP has a point. I did business with a Frenchman once. He was always turning up to meetings with clients in a polo neck and a pair of fancy looking trousers. He'd then proceed to complain about how difficult it was to do business with us in France (the country he was responsible for). It didn't make any sense to any of us.

That's not completely true. I have heard from multiple people here on Reddit that UK banks have refused to send money to btc-e and Bitstamp, citing high fraud risk as the reason. It does not always work. It appears to work well on localbitcoins (if you can stomach the markup applied by sellers there) but I would like to hear from anyone that has had their bank account frozen for buying from there.

It will lock-in in about 14 hours and activate fully after a 2-week cooling off period to allow miners to update. Mad not to hold at least some LTC now.

Bitcoin for slow and steady growth. Litecoin if you are prepared to accept risk but want a chance at higher returns over a shorter period.

About $5m USD. Not enough to influence the market these days.

It's highly unlikely his story was even true, hence why it's been deleted, but if it was he's still a reckless idiot who gambled.

Charlie, like anyone smart in this game, knows that what is good for Bitcoin is good for all crypto. Of course he wants to see his creation flourish but I applaud him and Coinbase for at least attempting to find an amicable way forward.

Ah yes, those two famous African states - Estonia and Slovenia.

Incredible to see in action

Only $10m a pizza then. Bargain.

Yes. You should be aware that any time an exchange suffers growing pains because more people than ever want to buy Bitcoin, some people think the world is about to end and will go on the internet claiming they are the next Mt Gox.

If I had access to a Korean bank account, I'd be arbitraging like mad right now. You should take advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:26:39
I really can't see the exchanges supporting UASF, which is needed if it's going to be a success. A Bitcoin chain split would create unprecedented FUD. No wonder people are diversifying into Litecoin, ETH etc.

Le Pen has never said she would ban cryptocurrency. Where on earth did you pull that from?

I found 10 BTC in a wallet last year which I had set up for a friend who never paid me for them. Purchased in 2011 for about $350, if that. I still have them.

I like Monero, really I do, but the people saying thank you on the r/Monero sub are simply embarrassing. Fluffy shat on them and they are begging for more. Pathetic!

There are so many great token based assets now which are used to pay for consumption of their respective network (Sia, Golem for example). The market is in a very different place than in 2013/14. I'm still expecting regular retractions, but I would be surprised if we saw an 80% crash as we did then.
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:28:25
Don't mistake record trading volumes, registrations, deposits and therefore support tickets as a sign it's about to collapse. Growing pains, but they are in a good state.

You are following me around Reddit, haha

Firstly, let me wish you good luck. Second, let me tell you how much of an idiot you are.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:02:46
What is this? A virus?
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:40:57
It will never be used by consumers for anything remotely useful. I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:10:17
Better all round. Switch half your BTC for LTC or lose it. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:27:33
You'll need to record the profit and loss of each trade and work out your net profit for capital gains tax calculation purposes. Alternatively, take the easy route and declare each asset was purchased at 1p per coin/token. You'll end up paying more tax this way but if HMRC ever come knocking they won't punish you for getting it wrong. 
Don't forget you get a tax free allowance for capital gains each tax year. Think it's £11,700 this year but don't quote me on that. 
Final question. Why are you doing your tax return now? Sure 16/17 isn't due until next year if completing online and by December is completing by post.

It's because they are 12 hours ahead so the price is in the future

First thing I'd do with the money is move out of that town.

By the time they receive the funds, the movie will already be out on DVD.

I really wish people would stop calling every exchange that suffers growing pains "the next Mt Gox".

One for the r/buttcoin bot.

Been waiting a few days for them to verify me and I've heard nothing. Not too excited so far.

There are over 70,000 shopify stores, which have generated more than 2bn in USD sales since they launched. This is huge news.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:18:13
Not to mention the fact that new money is not currently going into BTC-E because of USD funding problems.

Two years ago I was telling my brother-in-law about this little known crypto currency called Bitcoin. He was interested but was sure he had the "scam" figured out. As the weeks and months went by I kept him informed of its fortunes. He rejoiced and felt vindicated, I am sure, when the big crash happened. "It'll get going when merchants get hold of it" has always been my reply. A month ago he called me to say he realised just how wrong he was and wants some help buying both Bitcoin and Litecoin.
