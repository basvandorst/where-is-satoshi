Only when it's profitable to do so, when it's not profitable no people will not mine it

They provide a working blockchain.
If every single miner were to swap off mining btc guess what... There is no transactions. No on can move money from exchanges to wallets, no new coins generated.

Gonna sound crazy but you could buy off eBay which will transfer to your wallet.
Ideal for you really, pay in PayPal with your 10 a month and they handle the fees cause they send the coin to you.

Not to mine it's not. Not unless your paying 0.05 kWh for your electricity

Are you that stupid or can you just not read? 
Mining is not free. 
To mine btc you need an asic 
Say an s9 (the most common one) 
That's 950usd before shipping and import costs.
Oh... And a power supply... Add another 150 usd.
So without shipping in import costs that's 1100usd.
Then you factor in electricity, at 12 cent per kWh (us average) you make -0.62 usd a day.
10 cents and you break even. 
Free electricity and you make $3.29 a day.
So with free electricity it will take you 334 days to roi. 
334 days.
Where do you see this is free?

Not if it's not profitable to do so.

Dont change your wording. 
Your analogy, which you have made many times, is about people picking up money on the street. That has no barriers to entry. Mining does, mining btc has many more than other coins.
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:38:27
At the point it becomes unprofitable most would just buy the coin with the electrical cost instead of mining it as you get more for your money doing that. 
Price isn't the only thing that dictates profitability.

A cocaine dealers wet dream too, gotta stay awake somehow when the market never closes!

fair enough, it has the ability to make some cash if the mempool goes through the roof again but in the mean time its just like a cool experiment.
might give it a go in the next few days, off work with nothing to do so may as well i guess lol
@_date: 2019-03-30 12:04:13
Off topic a bit, but do you earn anything from having a nose or is it just like a cool techie thing to have/do whilst helping out at the same time 
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:41:05
How much power does it actually save per miner though?

@_date: 2019-10-17 11:20:44
Cause your legit question was about what pool to mine on. 
If you have enough money to buy 60 s9's than you should have 5 mins to do research on different pools.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:48:09
Most likely people buying after the thanksgiving chats in America

I've just had my first (diagnosed) bout if depression, doc has me on some pills for it atm. One of the guys I work with, they tried everything with him, he says he hit rock bottom 2 times trying to end it all... sad story turned happy he did exactly what you said, read all about it and did a tiny bit of ket, says he woke up the next morning a new man, literally changed his life.

The asic miners have a username and password to change any settings on them, for bitmain they are set to root root as standard so you would obviously change that as without the password no one can access the settings to change anything on the unit 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:19:52
Not without the password info. But the password is only as secure as you make it, storing it on your pc or using the same password for anything online obviously isn't advisable

$399, seems rather expensive when you can do it with a raspberry pi or am I missing something here?

Did you read what I said fuckwit? 
I havnt read the artical 
And as I said where I am in the UK meaning I'm talki g about myself and my experience.

"We supply all our members with 100% renewable electricity and 10% green gas. When you switch to Bulb, we make sure that for every unit of electricity you use, a unit is produced and put on the grid by a renewable source like Oak Grove Solar Farm in Monmouthshire. In addition, 10% of our gas comes from biomethane. That's gas produced from organic matter like sewage and manure - which is then reinjected onto the grid (minus the smell)."
From my supplier. The measure the energy from the grid we use then replace the grid with said renewable energy.

I'm not debating it lol, I commented on someone's comment on it. 
I don't have a position cause... I have not read it yet.
I'm simply pointing out that my statement was about where I live, it reads that clear as day yet the person made out like I was talking like I ment the whole world (which I never did) even after stating it's about when I live. Then called me a soccer mom (most likely cause I said about my kid)  when I'm a dude lol

Bit fucking dramatic calling him an idiot. 
Its simple and easy to buy from coinbase, yes there are cheaper but longer ways of buying with less fees but calling him an idiot instead of helping him is a cunt move.

I havnt ready the artical properly, will do when the kiddo is having her nap but the biggest thing for me is that miners always go for the cheapest energy source to max profits. 
Now (at least where I am in the UK) renewable energy is always the cheapest for a consumer. Yes obviously that energy is taken from the coal/nuke power plants but it's renewed by offshore wind farms (my provider anyways) so 100% of the power my rigs and house use is renewable. Which completely debunks that btc is bad for the environment imo.
