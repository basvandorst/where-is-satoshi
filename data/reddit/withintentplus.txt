That doesn't mean it's likely that Microsoft and dell are taking payment partly in btc. I suspect they take payout in dollars for simplicity and predictability.

I'd be curious to know what part of my comment people disagree with. I'm trying to learn more about bitcoin, and it's certainly possible that I misunderstand part of this, but I'm not seeing an inherent significant problem with a 37% cost. Can someone enlighten me?

Tl;dr: 37% mining cost isn't as high as it may sound and probably better long-term to have BTC in the market rather than horded. 
A 37% cost of production (even if conservative) doesn't seem to me to be a problem, in and of itself. That's reasonably favorable [compared to gold]( "Globe and Mail article"), for example - where the cost is at least 50% by the most conservative estimates, and actually much higher.
Electricity would also seem to be the only significant operating expense, so BTC is not subject to other unpredictable cost factors that affect other commodities as long as those factors don't impact cost of electricity broadly.  
Interestingly, this would seem (as others have mentioned) that BTC price could be significantly impacted by the price of oil (like so many other things).
Presumably, when the cost of production is high relative to BTC price, there will be fewer new mining operations started and less investment in hardware which at least stabilizes production levels, if not suppressing them. 
As long as it's possible to mine BTC for some profit, there will be new BTC created (until exhausted). A reasonable cost of this production helps balance the market and ensure that BTC are traded rather than horded. Seems to me that this means adoption and use therefore remain the key factors in a stable price.

That's not necessarily true, but it would seem to me that censoring topics makes it more difficult to determine what's true. Censorship also makes me question the motives of those doing the censorship. It undermines their credibility and will tend to make me less inclined to accept their position as a result.

As a completely ignorant outsider who has been reading a little of the current controversy, this comment brings up a question that has occurred to me earlier. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation, but: Why doesn't someone actually code a fork with a 4mb limit? 
Assuming this is more complicated than just wishing it, would an at least credible intention to do so have a good chance of becoming a popular compromise even if some would choose it simply as the lesser of evils?

Maybe, but censoring the topic makes me more sympathetic to XT, not less.
