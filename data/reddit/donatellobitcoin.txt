I'm still 105% up with my February 2019 LTC buy. I don't like the term 'shitcoin' but they're tanking hard. Take a look at HOT if you have a lot of time.

While that's true he can regulate it to death, at least in the US. Think of a special tax on crypto gains. And now keep in mind, that if you buy BTC for $100 and HODL for a bit and then buy a $200 you'd have to pay a crypto tax on the $100 difference. Even if you don't cash out.

Why yes it is.

It's not beyond our time, it's built upon knowledge gathered in hundreds of years of mathematics.

The advice is basically "HODL" and it's older than 2017.

I sent my brother about 0.25 bitcoin, telling him "Ya that should be about $3500". The transaction took a bit longer than usual, once of a sudden he screams in Discord "BITSTAMP ONLY SHOWS $2750" and I was like oh god oh fuck did I put the wrong address or amount and we wondered for 3 minutes until he saw it. 2k drop. Probably because the transaction we were in was a massive dump. It's like a pokemon but it sometimes devolves when you send it.
At least my brother's excited now!

It's 27°C here at 1am, where the fuck are you?

Note how the bitcoin is still having fun.
The HODL ride is really good value.
Only a HODler can have fun when Bitcoin drops 2k in a few moments.
HODL. Buy the dips. HODL. Buy the dips!

There's a reward for every block mined. The reward is cut in half every 210,000 blocks. So in 2140 the reward for mining will practically be 0 BTC and the circulating BTC will be practically 21,000,000.
[Further reading](
Edit: And yes, sometime in 2032 the reward for a block will be less than 1 BTC. It's a meme guys, not a whitepaper!
