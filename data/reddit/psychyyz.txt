There's going to be a point where just paying for the storage to keep a copy of the blockchain is out of a regular person's reach -- nevermind keeping all that storage reliable and online.

You merely lack imagination.  As block sizes move from 1MB to 8MB to 64, 128, 256, 1G, and so on as adoption picks up...  It will rapidly outpace what a simple hobbyist is willing (and able) to keep online in order to run a global payment network.  My 1Mbit DSL line from 1999 hasn't kept up with Moore's law the way CPU &amp; storage has.  And while efficiency has gone up, the cost of electricity has as well -- not everyone lives in a region with vastly subsidized power.

I'd like to recommend that you make your donations regularly occurring monthly payments.  This way you can track the organization's progress and reward them with an increase, or provide funding for specific projects that require an injection of capital.

Uh, addition &amp; subtraction seems like one of the things that can be done quickly on a local PC, and wouldn't be worth the bother.
Converting a video (ie YouTube), or creating a thumbnail (imgur) seems like something I might want to do under this model, but the relation of one value to the value immediately beside it would be important, and encrypting that file before processing it would make it impossible to maintain that relationship for a system that doesn't have the key.
Maybe I'm missing something, but I see this as being extremely limited in usefulness.

@_date: 2015-06-30 19:29:13

@_date: 2015-06-30 15:59:02
I'm going to need a high-to-medium level explanation.  Cryptography is meant to keep data private and secret and secure.  Being able to perform meaningful calculations on encrypted data (at least in my mind) means it's not actually encrypted, merely obscured/obfuscated.
Is your encryption method 'special' in some way?  How can anything meaningful be done to a file when you have such a small fraction of it?
For example, there are implementions of bzip2 that use parallel processing - how would compressing a file work in your scenario?  Would the results be meaningful or useful?
Another example:  a JPEG file -- if I push a 10MB JPEG into the network, can I obtain a thumbnail as the result by having each node return a single pixel?  Or would a JPEG file not work because of the structure of the file?  Would a RAW image work instead?
Also, why do these operations take hundreds / thousands /millions / billions more CPU cycles?  If you can truly operate on the encrypted data, where are the extra CPU cycles being burned?
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:00:42

You only really need to be ahead of the curve in order to win big.  By being one of the first CPU miners, then being the first GPU miners, then the first FPGA miners, you could earn shitloads of bitcoin by being slightly ahead of the curve -- rather than flicking a switch and decimating everyone else in the network.
Just knowing when the next iteration of miner software (GPU, FPGA) software was going to be released, you could order a couple cards/boards in the 30 days before the release of the software, and make the most money for the least investment, without disturbing the rest of the pool.
Then you cash out at the top, and leave the money in an interest-bearing account for your future self to enjoy.  :)

It is.  But just as you can transfer a currency across the globe in a few minutes (super cool), you have to take the down side that some dork is going to want to buy coffee with it.  
I personally think a limited block size will stop this sort of nonsense -- the transaction fee would end up being a large percentage of the cost of the transaction to compete against other, larger transactions with similar transaction fees (which would represent a miniscule percentage of the size of the transaction).  
The larger transactions with incrementally higher fees would push the smaller ones out of the blocks, leading to things like side-chains and other coins as intermediate currencies for things like high-volume small-value transactions.

I really don't get this.  If your transaction isn't urgent, low-ball it, and it'll get included in some block a couple hours later.  Yes, Bitcoin can make a transaction practically instant, but in a lot of situations, waiting a couple hours or even a day isn't a big deal.  Like, if I'm donating to a good cause, I'm okay if it takes a couple days to be confirmed.

Of the people I know working on blockchain solutions, each of their customers will have nodes containing the blockchain, and all of the customers will keep each other honest.  More customers = more hashing power = more security.  In the beginning, and on their testnet, they basically have a dozen PCs on a shelf.  When they go into production, they'll have a dozen cloud servers from a dozen different providers, and as each customer comes online, they'll remove one cloud server for every two customer systems.

Nope.  Blockchain is great for archival storage - where you want to keep small pieces of information for decades at a time, and to be sure that it's authentic years later.  It can be as simple as pointers to documents (with associated hashes) or as complex as storing documents and encryption keys.

@_date: 2017-11-06 15:13:24
In simple terms...  Your coins are protected by a private key.  The secret "private key" is what gives you ownership of your coins.  When a fork happens, the history of everything that happened to your bitcoins before that point is carried forward as part of the legacy.  (If they discarded all the previous blocks, it would be an entirely new coin.)
So, as long as you had control of bitcoins at the time of the fork, you now have an account balance on the old chain, and the new one.
That means you have twice as many coins as you did before -- but that doesn't mean you'll have twice the value in your local currency -- because coins post-fork are traded at a market value, and the market determines what BCH is worth separate from what BTC is worth.

I played around with bitcoin back in 2012.  It seemed neat, I mined a little.
Right now, I feel the whole state of bitcoin mirrors the US political landscape.  Nobody wants to collaborate, they want to dictate what they want to others, and expect them to obey.  People need to hear the word 'no' and accept the reasoning.  I can understand why the bitcoin core team is just powering forward with their plan -- because debating the pros and cons of a particular solution gets nothing done.
If the B2X crowd wants to invest the time / money / effort into making a new coin that does what they want, I don't understand why they feel entitled to force a hard fork.  If their solution is better, then release it and let it stand on it's own merits without fucking up Bitcoin.
All in all, I have nearly zero financial interest in any of this -- my savings are more than all the bitcoins I mined would likely ever be worth.  It's mostly my curiousity about technology that keeps me reading about this.

All these comparisons are inherently unfair.  Once you compare the power consumption to the energy consumption of every branch, every ATM, every datacentre, of every bank, in every country in the world, it begins to look like a fair fight.
I've worked in bank datacentres, branches, and office towers.  The amount of waste is staggering compared to a couple datacentres scattered around the world, all of them competing to find the highest efficiency tech, and the cheapest power, which is invariably becoming renewables -- hydro, geothermal, wind, etc.

You laugh, but I rented an office in a building near my house, and as I walked by, there was this gust of hot air coming from the basement...  I looked inside, and it looked very data-centre-ish.  I talked with one of the guys in the management office, and he said that the building had a "spare megawatt" after switching the lighting in the building to LED from old incandescent bulbs, so they put in a mining farm.

Do what major companies with analysts who earn millions of dollars a year do.  Today, Bitcoin is inherently risky.  Note their current value.  Take 50%, invest it elsewhere.  When (if?) the value rises back up to it's original value again, and the market still seems risky to you, then do it again, and put 50% somewhere else, repeat until you feel like Bitcoin is a solid investment when some / most / all of the issues outlined above get resolved or mitigated.

Your ASIC will contribute to the stability of BitCoin, although it won't earn you much of anything (unless each bitcoin hits hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars/euros/etc.).  Consider your involvement as a community service.
But now that you're contributing to running Bitcoin, get involved by buying and selling Bitcoins, and ordering equipment with them.  (Say, buy yourself a RaspberryPi to plug that USB ASIC into, to keep your power costs low.)

It's in their terms of service.
From the context, it might just mean if a user uploads a duplicate file, it'll be replaced.  This would be achieved by calculating a hash BEFORE encrypting and uploading the file.
I haven't seen the API, so I don't know how it's implemented.

@_date: 2013-08-19 15:46:17
I think it'll take another generation of ASICs for this to become even remotely feasible.  It's not possible to break even with today's equipment, at today's prices, with today's difficulty.
This is an arms race of diminishing returns.  A new ASIC with a hash rate 10x the current high end, that consumes less than half the power will need to make an appearance, and given how much everyone has invested, I just don't see it happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:37:17
That's funny.  I was looking at the Raspberry Pi website this morning...  I've had good luck with my setup in terms of reliability so far, but was wondering how much more power I could save with a 5V board running the client instead of a whole functional PC.
In the end, I'm not sure there's a big enough difference to make the leap to a RPi...  Although, my profitability took a hit last night again, I'm only generating 0.008 BTC/day now.  It will take me at least 4 months to generate a single bitcoin at this rate.

@_date: 2013-07-11 17:04:04
The only snag seems to be that there's still no way to prevent the collection of metadata.  Who's talking, to whom, and how often.
If there's a central server where messages are cached (encrypted or not) it should be possible to monitor messages going in, and messages coming out -- and that seems to be what the NSA is more interested in.
Until there's a tor-like ability to abstract who's talking to whom, then this really isn't a revelation in instand messaging.

There is a risk inherent in trading locally.  There's been more than one case of folks getting ripped off in person when exchanging bitcoins for products or currency.
@_date: 2013-07-11 18:37:52
I just think it's a solution that doesn't address the core issue.
From what I've read, it won't be hard to do the same sort of metadata analysis that the NSA is doing now if both parties are online at the same time.  A store-and-forward system with brief (but random) delays in message exchange makes it difficult, but also adds lag to the solution.
It would be nice to see a sort of misdirection integrated into the solution -- a random, nonsense message sent to a random recipient at random intervals, which, when decoded by the reciever, are either replied to with a similar message in return, or silently ignored.  It would become difficult if not impossible to differentiate the signal from the noise at that point.
@_date: 2013-01-21 13:16:09
But it doesn't take much to beat the hashing system -- modifying one bit changes the hash dramatically.  I'm sure there's a comment field somewhere in most multi-gigabyte files that could be changed imperceptibly to avoid the hashing issue.
Personally, I'd just consider uploading 50GB of data from /dev/urandom -- it's a legitimate use, but it would clearly frustrate any and all attempts to identify/decypher/decrypt the data inside.
@_date: 2013-02-22 14:34:53
Network boot?  Put the boot image on a network drive in ISO format, and each system has no local storage.  That way every time a system is rebooted, it gets a fresh copy of the OS, Browser settings, etc.
You'd still have to watch for hardware keyloggers, but that's relatively easy.
@_date: 2013-06-12 22:55:59
Uh, even with a new phone &amp; SIM, if you keep calling the same group of people you've always communicated with, they'll be able to determine (with a high degree of accuracy) that your patterns are similar, and can establish that you're the same person.  
Also, if someone enters your new phone number into their smartphone, and either assigns it a new contact with your name, or adds it to their existing contact info, then syncs with Google/Apple -- surprise, they'll know who you are.
The only way to escape this is to go off the grid entirely -- which is why the only choice we have is to stop this invasive surveillance.
