What do you think the problems are?
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:39:10
That's untrue as it's unknowable.  When they say profits they aren't talking about new money created.  They simply mean the interest paid back on loans.  The Federal Reserve can authorize all kinds of things including new banks given to their buddies.  It's a scam.  
If you wanted to have a fair inflationary currency all new units would go to whoever held the existing units in proportion to the amount they hold.  This way your money wouldn't be watered down.  They will never do that.  
Also, the board members and president are all figure heads that get told what to do.  The central bank is in no way run by the government.  It's the other way around.  All you have to do is look at how much the Treasury owes the Fed.  The lender is always in charge.

If the backing entity won't give you anything for your currency, it's not backed.

Just telling it like it is.  The success or failure of bitcoin rests on his shoulders.  Period.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:59:37
Lol.  Either seek the truth or don't.  Since you likely won't there you have it.  
If you don't know who nullc is in this space, you are absolutely not a longtime user or you just use bitcoin and don't pay attention to what's happening behind the scenes.  Find out who that account belongs to and just search.

The US government has zero control over USD.  The government does not create USD.  Only banks and the central bank create USD.  
You're right though, the central bank will exert enormous pressure over the government to keep the USD in power.  Still, even at 1 million per bitcoin that puts bitcoin at about 2.5x the market cap of all gold.  It still wouldn't be close to a threat to USD.  I haven't checked but someone posted that would be about 1% the value of all currencies in existence--nothing.
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:18:43
Hard truths are still truths.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:12:47
At 1 million each, bitcoin would be 2.5 times the value of all gold.  It would hardly be felt globally at all.

Just follow He is the king of bitcoin.  Whatever he says goes.
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:19:46
I remember this.  It was trivial and just done so people like you can point to it and say, "See, Greg isn't the king of bitcoin!"  Whatever Greg wants is what happens to Bitcoin.  We all saw that after the Hong Kong agreement.

The only one that makes sense is lost wallets can't be recovered but that is what you get with non-custodial money.  


It's behaving like a currency that's finding it's value among all the other currencies.  
Your other objections have nothing to do with bitcoin.  
As a thought experiment, describe the perfect currency and see what you get.

This is entirely wrong.  I don't think you understand how money is created.  The Treasury actually prints physical currency but this has nothing to do with actual money creation, the vast majority of which is digital.  The Treasury which is part of the government maintains physical currency so it's usable--pretty much.  Still they borrow money from the federal reserve which is not part of the government at all.  
  
The vast majority of money is supposedly created by commercial banks.  The Fed does create money though and who the hell knows how much or who they give it to as they aren't audited in any meaningful way.  It is a huge scam.   If you can't know the inputs(new units created) your money is a scam.  
Anyhow, most people have no idea what's going on and if they did, they wouldn't denigrate bitcoin which is entirely open.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:20:08
The government doesn't create money. Printing is just to maintain physical bills. Banks and the central bank create money.

I have a friend that gets all his songs, movies and books off bittorent.  I have no idea what you're talking about here.

If this caused you to be homeless for ten years, you really need to learn to put things past you, move on and create more opportunities for yourself--the last being the most important.  
The only way I could see this happening is if you have serious health problems.

Lol, if it were 1 million that would only be around 2.5 times the value of all gold--a drop in the bucket compared to all the currencies of the world.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:16:03
Bitcoin at 1 million would be a market cap of roughly 18 trillion. Golds market cap is 7.6 trillion.  That's around 2.4 times the market cap of gold.  It won't be a big deal at all.

Very few people will EVER run their own node or lightning node.  If that's what it takes for mass adoption, it simply won't happen.
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:34:28
That would be cool if you could redeem a fixed amount of gold or something from the US government there but no, each year the value of what you can buy from Amazon shrinks and there's no place there that the government will give you anything for your US dollars so if the value plummets to zero--well.  
I just want that guarantee from the US government I've been told about.  Looks like maybe they don't back them.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:20:56
Only a matter of time before this becomes cheap.  
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:48:34
It's just math.  Assuming 18 million bitcoins, which in actuality will be less due to the quantity of bitcoins lost forever, etc. you just multiply that times 1 million which gives you 18 trillion.  All the gold in the world is worth around 7.5 trillion.  18 divided by 7.5 is 2.4.  I was just estimating before so the number is even lower.
1 million dollar bitcoin will hardly be felt.  Someone else has posted that this would equate to about 1% of the total value of all money in the world.  This is just a drop in the bucket.  
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:20:31
You're dead right.  Most think the government creates money but it's the banks.  They have the most to lose.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:06:07
Yes, but people are saying it's backed by the US government.  I want to trade them in for something real since it's backed.  Where do I go and what can I get for these US dollars?
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:43:06
Nice...what will the government give me for my US dollars?
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:50:05
It's a function of time with a fixed unit currency or a slowly expansive one like bitcoin.  Over time, as they spend it, they can't just create more like in the past.    Of course, they can game the hell out of it while it's so small.

People sell their homes now.  That is literally your answer.  Why ever sell a home if it keeps going up in value?  
Also, in a deflationary model, prices go down over time AND you constantly get new loans from just saving your money.  So now you have a choice, save your money or invest it depending upon which is a better return.
@_date: 2019-09-27 23:05:31
You guys are doing great.  It's better to have more bugs on the second layer and release more code in my opinion.  Everyone knows it's not super solid yet.  I'd rather just get it super ready for all kinds of things with around 100 bucks on it max right now.  Really want amp.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:06:50
...and what can I get for these bonds?
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:49:55
I just want to get equal amounts of what the government backs my dollars for.  Is it gold?  I don't know.  Can I not get anything for my dollars from the government if I trade them in?  I thought they backed them.  
It seems like you're saying the government does not back my US dollars.
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:55:19
As a mental exercise, describe a perfect new currency and what it would look like.
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:04:52
Looks like it's not backed by the government like some here were saying.  They won't give you anything for them.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:13:33
Sorry...they said it was backed by the US government so I should be able to get what backs it for myself.  You must be talking about someone else with the rest of that stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-27 08:42:39

I admit I don't understand.  I just want to get something for my dollars.  Is there a site I can go to or a mailing address?  Thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:04:16
Sweet...so where can I go to trade in my US dollars for that?  I'll take a national forest.  Where can I go to claim some of a national forest?

I just want a  rough timeline for amp without people telling me to code it myself.  I think it will be a huge win for lightning.
