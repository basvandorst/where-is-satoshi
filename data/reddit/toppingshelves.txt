Nvm found a better link

Bitcoin and beyond!
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:04:13
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:05:08
Because no one except you and a small percent of confused people want it. Confused because they were tricked
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:16:12
It's not bitcoin, it's bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:52:23
Any interest starting your own company? That's the first thing I'd be thinking if I was "retiring" at 30
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:57:38
Haha to prove a point to the family I only buy at the ATH but at this rate I'm gonna be broke. Fiat broke...
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:23:28
Done that. Still confused
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:34
I'm watching it we're at 12850 currently
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:22:21
That he bought with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:08:57
Or could it be that the there is an insane amount of people getting into bitcoin. Someone claimed coinbase had 1 million per month new users.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:14:30
And right now
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:36:37
You're looking at a blip in the bigger picture. When it shoots to the moon 7k is a meager stepping stone 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:24:45
Horrible excuse. go collect some cans from the parties and you'll have plenty of money for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:26:27
I guess that's kinda what I'm saying here, I'm just happy to be apart of this whole thing even if I only have a small amount. But profit doesn't hurt too

The fluctuation shows how much there is to gain 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:59:09
The shills man the shilllsss
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:02:39
Yeah that's what I'm kinda realizing. I already transferred to breadwallet, should I just transfer back? Sorry realllly new to this.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:54:29
Hey big banker
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:28:49
It's fluctuating like crazy. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:29:45
Every "crash" had come back 10 times higher than before. 10 times is probably exaggerating but it's always gone back up. Historically 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:55:13
Same kind of situation with cannabis
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:50:37
Doesn't the crazy fluctuations make you excited. In my mind it means it's still so underpriced
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:52:11
Would you mind explaining this subject in very basic English lol. What's the whole Seg. Deal
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:17:28
Can't really argue with that, 20 years is 20 years
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:59:09
The shills man the shilllsss
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:49:15
Ahh I see, just sent it over to breadwallet. I've reasearched and that seems to be to most recommended wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:38:39
About that
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:43:11
I would be willing to bet most people dont even have that in total savings 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:29:16
Definitely complicated but a bit of research and it's becoming more clear. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:34:04
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:47:39
I'm the guy who said I'd wait till it crashes to buy. Ugh normally this would be a crash but bitcoin it's just another day 
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:10:48
Got me all fired up! 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:47:39

@_date: 2017-09-21 22:10:47
Don't worry about it man, i did the same exact thing and I'm going to buy at 3k if it gets that low too. It's the long haul that counts
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:43:56
Thanks and there's no transactions fees for this? I have breadwallet
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:43:32
This guy sold at 3500
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:03:02
Just bought at 4K 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:13:05
Thank you I was about to ask about that. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:10:30
I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:44:17
Precisely 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:46:02
Awesome really appreciate the help. Another dumb question, why did they do this? Seems more trouble than it's worth? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:16:45
Me as well haha except work not school. I wish school 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:54:29
Hey big banker
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:49:11
Or in a week
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:31:52
Destruction, we have total destruction.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:58:50
That's pretty crazy to think about, I'm hoping to put 10 percent of my paycheck towards it each month. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:49:11
Or in a week
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:41:05
Same boat as you. A bit less so I'm not too worried about it but I'm just happy to be here lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:50:37

@_date: 2018-02-20 16:49:42
I hope you're joking 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:44:04
Dumb question but where or how do I know which I'm on and how would I go about switching etc. 
Sorry I'm such a newb. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:23:03
I can't imagine what people will be saying then.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:32:39
I have to say it. 6k by tomorrow morning.

Don't you love the classic reddit comment "you could just look it up on google"
What's the point of reddit then haha
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:46:05
Your dog just sits there thinking "hodl is life, I'm in it for the long haul"
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:59:45
What does that actually mean, set up a node? I'm a noob.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:33:25
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:41:43
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:38:19
Just went $100 at the same price
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:09:00
Could you explain further in new to coinbase and I'm about to buy a few hundred worth lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:38:17

"All that oil bois"
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:31:25
So every time I log into my wallet and it says syncing I'm essentially downloading it? 
Am I running the RIGHT Node?/how do I know
