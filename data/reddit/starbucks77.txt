Nothing is wrong with them when you consider the average age of the commenters here. 16-24 year old white males. Young people aren't typically overflowing with life experience or tragedy, etc. They're the least likely to emphasize and thus they tell jokes. Ever wonder why there isn't an "adult" (30-60 year old) 4chan or /b/? It's not because they're too out of touch with the dank memes, it's because they don't want to laugh at someone slicing their schlong with a razor blade.

If you can't or don't anticipate spikes in new users or traffic, you have no fucking business being in IT. Spikes in traffic and a surge of new users should be the backbone of your scaling plan. And if you don't have a scaling plan, you shouldn't be in this business at all - full stop. 
You say those things as if that excuses them -- this is 2017. Scaling should be inherent to any of your plans. It's like how accepting credit cards should be inherent to any online business's plans.

It's not like this is a one time thing, any time there's increased action, coinbase goes down. If it was once or twice, I can understand growing pains. But we're now talking a dozen or more incidents. It's either extreme negligence or it's purposeful. So the hate is more than deserved. It's how we get them to fix it.

Government debt isn't the same as personal debt. Government debt can be bad, sure, but it can also be good. And in many cases, not just good but *essential*. 
If we had zero debt right now the impact would be disasterous. The value of the U.S dollar would be sky-high for starters, sounds like a good thing, right? Wrong. Trading with other countries would be cost-prohibitive for them, nobody would buy our exports because they'd be too expensive - a $10 widget would cost like $100. This is why countries like China keep the value of their currency artificially low (manipulate their currency). It allows them to be more competitive with exports.

That's not how the internet bubble went or worked. It wasn't an "internet bubble" either. If anything, it was a start-up or venture capitalist bubble. And in truth, there's quite the parallel between the start-up bubble and all these alt-coins people are trying to get in on.
You can always tell people who were alive and experienced something from those who weren't by the way the talk about those events. Just because you watched some YouTube videos or read a few Wikipedia articles doesn't mean you're suddenly an expert on said topic - this is a problem that didn't really exist before the internet and it's kinda fascinating to me. Millennials think their internet research trumps life experience (aka wisdom).

I work in business and IT, harder? Definitely. But most IT problems an be solved overnight by throwing money at it. If coinbase really wanted these problems fixed yesterday, they could be. But they're not willing to pay for the convenience. They're still relying on their in-house team of morons who clearly can't fix these issues since they've been on going since May.
Ignorant people here, yourself included, are acting like this is some new frontier. Exchanges and money transfer services have been around as long as the internet. The technology behind them, and the core program ideology us **old**. This is not new, uncharted territory. This is old and already in history books. 
There are plenty of other exchanges out there that do not suffer these same issues. Hell, the Chinese exchanges purr like a kitten. This leads me to believe coinbase is doing this on purpose in order to either make money, or reduce losses. Or it's extreme negligence. It's happened too many times for it to be anything else.

The average big blocker are people who were duped by these people - they're defending their position on misinformation. The point of the article was to show both sides of the argument are not the same, it's not two sides of the same coin.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:16:45
I love how people are doing /btc's work for them. The two arguments are not equivalent. One is the opinions of a company/cabal/cartel of Chinese Miners with the other side is everyone else. One is an organic community while the other has a direct financial incentive and motive. 
Equating the two stances as equivalent means a fundamental lack of understanding of the issues. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:26:51


I think that's impossible to judge without first defining the variables which denote "better". Bitcoin suffers from a Chinese mining cabal whereas bitcoin does not. This means they can essentially beta test new features first without fighting with the Chinese cartel. From a purely value standpoint, Bitcoin wins because it's worth more. 
It all depends on what factors you use, measuring stick we use to gauge that subjective argument.
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:19:39
Moreover it shows that both sides of the argument are *not* the same. And if the PRC is involved, which is increasingly more likely every day, the 'other side' could be a hostile entity.
The scary part is that the PRC could step in at any point and there's no way for us to know unless they slip up.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:10:23
The infighting isn't real. It's manufactured. Look at the recent poll ladt month where you basically had to prove who you were to vote; there was no split, no divide. Everyone almost unanimously voted against Bitmain and Jihan's direction.
Which leads me to the issue of this meme: it's inaccurate. The guy standing in front should be replaced with a flag -- the flag of the People's Republic of China. They've been trying to get into the crypto game for some time now. And be honest, would the PRC do it in their name? Or would they just back some local third party company they could control (to give them deniability and separation)? Just about every large country has announced grand plans for cryptocurrency, even Russia. But China has remained relatively silent by comparison. Why do you think that is? It's because they control the mining that takes place in their country. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they subsidized Bitmain in its entirety.
And China has shown it can control the exchanges at a moment's notice - anyone recall the trading freeze a while back? 
I think people forget that China might be more capitalistic than it was 20 years ago, it's still one of the most authoritarian governments in the world. It has total control and everything needs government approval, especially running a decentralized anonymous digital currency which would allow its citizens to bypass its incredibly strict fiscal controls. That's why Bitmain (aka China) wants more centralization -- they want more control.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:23:34
Even a billionaire can't compete with the resources of an entire nation. Bitmain and the rest of the Chinese mining cabal are backed, if not wholly owned by the People's Republic Of China. People forget China may have become more capitalistic, it's still not a democracy -- the government has total authority and absolute control. It's how they're receiving all that subsidized free electricity.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:26:58
Sounds nice but competing with the People's Republic Of China is next to impossible even if there was competition. China can subsidize everything and run at a loss just because it doesn't hurt them. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:04:42
And that itself is damning; Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized with no single person or entity having a lot of power. Bitmain (aka Jihan) has quite a bit of power and wants to retain that power as well as acquire more. He's part of the largest mining cabal and in a huge conflict of interest, is the only manufacturer of ASIC chips (a monopoly). The motivations alone should be enough to discredit him. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:29:03

It's interesting considering who developed the technology, and who is behind it. The Chinese government... It's literally (not figuratively) "Chinacoin". Why anyone would trust them when it comes to fiscal freedom, decentralization and anonymity is beyond me. It's like trusting North Korea on issues of human rights (and I'm only half exaggerating).

@_date: 2017-11-13 09:27:44
Billionaires? I think you mean trillionaire. I'm of the opinion the PRC is behind or at the very minimum, pulling Bitman (Jihan's) strings.
Consider how controlling the government is in China; great firewall and the strictest fiscal laws of a top 50 economy (Chinese citizens cannot move money out of China without government permission, foreign companies aren't allowed to operate within China without government approval, etc etc). Now along comes this technology which not only allows regular citizens to bypass its incredibly strict fiscal controls, but do so *anonymously*. 
The PRC has to be absolutely terrified of bitcoin. Rather than ban it and make the same mistakes as in their past, this time they choose to [attempt to] control it. And they do it through owning a majority of the hashrate and own all mining - not just that but the sole producer of ASIC chips is in China. 
And the knockoff capital of the world has yet to have any competitors making their own asic chips to sell? Why haven't a dozen other companies popped up in China selling their own mining chips/rigs? It's unheard of in China, unless of course, the government is involved and making sure that Bitmain remains a monopoly. Combine that with all that free subsidized electricity and it puts them at an advantage. They do the same thing with shipping; subsidize the hell out of it to make it difficult for other countries to compete..

To be fair, and realistic, it'll rise again until the time it doesn't. At some point in the future, whether it's next year, 5 years or 20, it will be replaced by the next best thing, whether that's something already out, under development, or still in the back of some genius's mind, if you believe in the technology, then you have to admit bitcoin isn't at the pinnacle. It's going to share the field with others until one eventually surpasses it. I don't think it'll be any time soon, but I do think it will happen.

When you're talking about tens of millions of dollars, or more, anything is possible. And the most insidious group among all of bitcoin are the Chinese miners, they're not here because they believe in the tech or ideology, they're here for the profits.
An even worse possiblity is that the PRC is pulling the strings; they wouldn't give a shit about profit and their only goal would be control and/or destruction. They have to see bitcoin as one of their biggest threats. A mostly anonymous currency which allows any citizen to bypass their incredibly strict fiscal controls? If you think the u.s government has tight regulations, look at China's. They make the US look like a libertarian paradise. Citizens literally cannot move money out of China without government approval. Which they, if ever, rarely give (unless you're connected, bribe the right official, or are working on behalf of the PRC).

People still need loans, want to take out mortgages, buy bonds, etc etc etc. If Fiat disappeared tomorrow and was replaced with crypto, then there would be crypto banks. 
Banks offer more services than just holding money for people. And as long as people need those services, banks will exist.

Are you really justifying their xenophobia and isolationism? Looking to the past as a way to justify their economic oppression is literally backwards thinking. They should be looking to the future. The world was a very different place 500 years ago, hell, it was very different just 50 years ago. Everyone who 'wronged' them is long dead. I take it you're Chinese? Only a Chinese person would think something that happened hundreds of years ago is relevant today. That kind of thinking is what's going to keep that culture handicapped, unable to reach it's full potential. 
We're moving towards globalization, like it or not. The internet has made this inevitable. The free flow of information is going to be the downfall of oppressive governments. They can do their best to hold back the tide but it's only a matter of time before that too, becomes futile. 
China's greatest folly, flaw and weakness these past 500 years isn't external (other countries), it's their inability to adapt and evolve with the times. It's their reluctance to change and grow.

Correcting bad actors must first begin by identifying them, and identifying their bad behavior. You do this by calling them out publicly so everyone can see. How do you correct bad behavior if you don't know what it is?
More to the point, it's not a binary or black and white choice, we can call them out and implement your approach as well. I personally want to know who the bad actors are and I want others to know as well. Not knowing who they are helps no one nor bitcoin.

We jest, but China banning not just bitcoin but all cryptocurrencies is near certainty. 
Cryptocurrencies allow its citizens to bypass its incredibly strict fiscal controls. It allows its citizens to move money around without government approval or knowledge. And most importantly, move yuan out of the country.
China's fiscal controls make U.S regulations look like a libertarian/anarcho-capitalist utopia by comparison. It's only a matter of time before China cracks down.
My guess is China allows just a single cryptocurrency, one which they can control and monitor; Antshares/NEO. The PRC'S very own cryptocurrency.

This subreddit is so naive and/or ignorant. They don't see bitcoin as a threat, they see it as another commodity or stock, which at this point, it is. It will also remain so as long as people speculate on the price, and gamble on the market.
Another thing people in this subreddit do is study bitcoin and think it somehow qualifies them to day trade or week/month trade. That's like me studying how corn grows, the biology of it all and thinking I'm now an expert in corn commodities and I should day trade..

It depends on how they became a monopoly. If it was sinister business practices, say buying up all the competition, you'd be correct. But the ASIC manufacturer is only a monopoly because they got there first. Like it or not, mining is an incredibly niche market so there isn't/wasn't much of a demand. Not enough for a company like AMD or NVIDIA to devote a factory to churn them out. That means it **can** happen that fast because nothing is stopping the competition. There are no barriers to entry.

Conspiracy theory about the Chinese government? 
It's not a conspiracy that the CCP has total control of the country, they're an authortarian government; one of the most controlling in the world. Is their great firewall a conspiracy theory? 
This is important because it's also no conspiracy theory that China has incredibly strict fiscal controls on its citizens. They can't send $5k overseas, or invest in Google (a foreign company) **without government approval**. Cryptocurrencies allowed chinese citizens to bypass those controls. When it comes to money, China does not fuck around. 
And all that subsidized electricity, there is no way China just looked the other way when it came to bypassing it's laws, regulations and control. *China is not the U.S government*. They could march 3 dozen armed officers into Bitmain's offices and seize control if they wanted, and what could anyone do? Absolutely nothing. Bitmain knows this, everyone in China knows this, so China doesn't have to go to those lengths. They just have to ask and Bitmain would do whatever they need. 
This is a country that kidnapped a small Hong Kong book store owner because he wouldn't give up his customer list. And you claim the CCP/PRC involvement is a conspiracy? You clearly don't know much about the geopolitics of China, or their economic policies. I've lived in China, I'm intimately familiar with how they run things there and I'd be fucking flabbergasted if they *weren't* involved in some way.

It's all relative. In Japan, energy is super expensive to begin with. They live on an island without many natural resources. And nuclear is only just now starting to get accepted again (they shut down all the reactors after Fukushima). 
Compared to China, where the government subsidizes energy by burning more coal than any 3 countries combined, it does look expensive.

It's no wonder energy is cheap in China, they don't give a fuck about our planet.

Why even have the argument? It's a waste of time. If you were duped by the likes of and the Chinese mining cabal, then that's your own closed-mindedness making you ignorant. That's what your wordy post says to me; it wasn't difficult to see which side was in your/our best interests, you were just being too stubborn to view or accept the facts. You shouldn't need these subreddits to convince you, you should have looked at the facts yourself, and came to that conclusion on your own.

I heard the Chinese government is the one behind this. People forget or are just ignorant; business in China isn't like business in the US. In China, any large business is overseen or outright controled by the state. 
Now I don't know if his business is based out of China, but as long as he has family there, that's all it takes for the PRC to strong-arm him into doing what they want. They do it all the time, every time someone is caught spying for China, the report is always the same, "they have my family" or "they threatened my family back home, I had too".
China's own currency is strictly controled. If it wasn't, it would have crashed long ago. They (the PRC) needs to control and monitor everything. So Bitcoin is essentially the antithesis of what they stand for - a decentralized u trackable currency. 
Jihan may say he stands for Bitcoin but what does his actions show? Actions speak louder than words. If you were China and you wanted to damage Bitcoin, how would you do it?

And if you're the Chinese government, and you want your fingers in the BTC pie so to speak, so you can manipulate, damage or poison it, how would you do it? Create a BTC company named People's  republic of China's Bitcoin technology Inc. ? Or would you give a bunch of money to some bright citizens (to start or buy a company) who are sympathetic to you/the country, and know the industry who will do what you ask? Of course they wouldn't be obvious about it, they need some separation or distance from the project for it to be effective.

I panic sold when I found out the majority of the hashrate rested squarely behind the great red firewall. How anyone can trust them and count on them to act in the best interest of Bitcoin is baffling to me, bordering on ridiculous. 
The government of China could just walk right into Bitmain and seize control at anytime (if the haven't already) and there's nothing anyone could do. It would be completely legal. Keep in mind that it's something they do *all the time*. This is a country that has no problem disappearing a book store owner from Hong Kong for a couple weeks because he sold a couple books they didn't like. They wanted his customer list.
And that was for something minor, Bitcoin threatens their fiscal policy and ideology -- for them it's all about control. Frankly, I'm astounded they haven't moved in to shut the show down yet.

You act like the Uncle snorting oxy is the drain on the system but he was/is the driving force in the beginning. It's not a stretch to say that without him (the darknet markets), we might not even be here today. So to blast the druggies for this is, to put it bluntly, naive.

How I wish that were true. I wish it to my very core. I think one side is acting out of logic and reason while the other is a bad actor. Bad in that they want to see Bitcoin fail. Hard to believe? Not if that bad actor is The People's Republic Of China. China strictly controls their economic system. From limiting how much a citizen can invest, withdraw or move around to giving permission for businesses to operate, if not completely oversee. China's economic system makes the U.S's look like a libertarian utopia by comparison. 
With that said, you think they allow Bitmain to run in their country, subsidizing all that free electricity without wanting something in return? That's if they didn't just set up the whole company themselves.  You think they tolerant a decentralized anonymous currency to operate within their borders out of altruism? Bitcoin is everything they are against. We need to see Bitmain as a bad actor because they are. Trust is earned and if actions speak louder than words, the facts are clear: Don't trust Bitmain.

I sold most of my Bitcoin and bought into LTC. Blasphemy, I know. But I did so for a different reason than most. When people talk about August 1st and Miners vs Core or users, they're getting one thing dead wrong. It isn't vs Miners, it's vs *Chinese* Miners. Western logic and expectations do not necessarily apply. Chinese culture is significantly different from Western culture and the behavior will be not as predictable -- often they can't be counted on to act in their (or Bitcoin's) best interest. And how much control do Chinese Miners have? How much hashpower rest within that country? 
If you're expecting Miners to do the right thing, do what's right in the interests of everyone, I might take that bet. But *Chinese* Miners? I lived in China and I wouldn't bet on them if you put a gun to my head. I can't predict the future but I do know it isn't going to be pretty; that much I know. I moved my assets to LTC and ETH and it appears I'm not the only one. I hope I'm wrong, I rarely am, but I would love to be pleasantly surprised by Bitcoin's tenacity &amp; fortitude. However, having one or two groups of people (cabals) controlling the hashpower and blockchain, I thought bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized?

False dichotomy, Democratic Socialism doesn't try or claim to be "real Socialism". And I think OP might be confusing Democratic Socialism with a social democracy. They're not the same thing. Most of Europe, Canada and Japan are social democracies. It's a capitalist economy, Democratic political system combined with robust social welfare programs and things like universal health care.
I say just let the facts speak for themselves; look at the quality of life index (aka the where to be born index) and see which system is doing the best. The ranking takes a multitude of objective factors into consideration, like crime, education, income disparity, corruption, health care, mortality, average wealth and average salaries, etc etc..

And which country do you think is doing the worst damage? Which country is completely controlled by their government, strictly limits how much currency their citizens can invest, withdraw and move out of the country?
 It's the same one that has a great firewall to monitor and restrict what their citizens can view on the internet. The same one that has no problem subsidizing free electricity so they can monopolize mining and thus control, damage, disrupt and subvert what they see as the literal antithesis of their fiscal ideology. A free currency, decentralized and anonymous? Did anyone actually believe China was tolerant of it out of some sort of altruism? Such a belief ranks right up there with believing the leader of North Korea was born on a golden mountain birthed by unicorns with rainbows for horns. 
Make no mistake, Bitmain is ran by the PRC. It's possible it didn't start out that way (doubtful) but it's the case now.

Question: will their monopoly end? Is segwit a certainty? Or is there still doubt? Can bitmain stop segwit? 
This is so fucking surreal to me. A few years back, when Bitcoin started making waves in China I thought to myself "Damn, the PRC ain't gonna like this... Bitcoin runs contrary to what that country stands for (complete control over its citizens lives)" And I guessed that they'd either ban the whole thing in their country, or they'd do something a bit more nefarious  -- like starting some front business to grab market share and control, disrupt, damage or even destroy it all together​. And it seems like Bitmain fits that description perfectly. I mean if you were China, and you wanted to damage or hurt Bitcoin, how would *you* go about doing it?

How many companies make Asic processors again? And I'm sure that 1 company doesn't do any conflict of interest actions like starting a big mining pool(s) and hiding proxy mining pools, right? How much of the hashrate rests within China, behind the great firewall?
You *might* have a leg to stand on if Bitmain didn't mine, or wasn't the sole asic provider, or tried to sneakily mine in pools anonymously... They're a trifecta of monopolies. Hell, let's go for the grandslam; they're based out of China and the PRC is notoriously strict when it comes to their fiscal controls. A decentralized, anonymous currency which allows their citizens to circumvent their fiscal limits &amp; policies (China limits and scrutinizes their citizens money, makes the U.S look like a libertarian paradise) ? 
Sorry, but it's inevitable that the Chinese Bitcoin market has an expiration date. It's only a matter of time -- unless of course China does the smart thing and covertly take over the BTC industry in China, enough of their fingers in the pie to manipulate, damage or cause uncertainty and doubt since they know they can't completely destroy it.

China's the last entity we should want with their claws in this thing. Look at how much freedom they allow their citizens, economic or otherwise. Extremely strict capital controls with limits and restrictions on how each citizen can invest, withdraw or otherwise own, great firewalls, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to not lose their own power. You think the PRC is embracing Bitcoin because they fancy it? They're tolerant in so far as they're​learning how to undermine​, damage and control it. The entire thing is the antithesis of their fiscal ideology.

China wants total control over its citizens and it looks like Bitcoin is no exception. China needs to be cut out of the equation if Bitcoin wants to stay health, and avoid further hiccups and speed bumps. 
Jihan is a Chinese nationalist. Went to Peking University. If you were the PRC, how would you damage Bitcoin if you saw it as a threat or even an inconvenience?

Huh, 4chan is one thing, but BIPs are something else entirely. This is a community of Bitcoin users, hodlrs, investors, enthusiasts and developers. Notice how I left out "Miners"? Like it or not, it's an 'either or' situation. Either you support the users and devs, or you support the Miners. The BIP support reflects that. Miners are interested in their profits, their opinions &amp; decisions are out of self-interest. It's straight up a conflict of interest to let them run Bitcoin. Even if you don't agree with the devs, or their vision/direction, it's still the lesser evil by a significant amount.
