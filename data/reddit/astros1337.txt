Yeah so funny that our country is falling apart and is completely dysfunctional. haHAA haHAA. Stay in school kids...

How can you people with this much dispensable income be so damn stupid? You really tried to wire $40,000 on coinbase and are surprised it's not going throw?
What a sad individual you are.

Why didn't he just re-up in 2013? Wtf? This has to be a troll.

The trump impeachment train is rolling, and bitcoin is flying. Good days boys, good days!

Worried about the crypto market cap getting too big? The derivatives market is worth $1.2 quadrillion.
See you boys on the moon!

I hope you stay in school, child...

I love the fact that reddit has completely turned on fat boy trump.
If only you guys could have seen the train wreck coming before hand though. Better letter than never at least.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:17:27
Easily trillions. I keep saying it, but the derivatives market is currently worth 1.2 quadrillion. QUADRILLION.
To the moon boys.

"contributing to society". Keep telling yourself that, kiddo.

Lul. Well done, said the capitalist society. Now time to take out a mortgage like a good American! Lul.

At least CNN is actually talking about crypto. Unlike fake news Faux who only talks about Hillary Clinton...still...basically in 2018.

Congratulations on your guns, moron.

Love people celebrating the ridiculousness that is crypto. Bravo, people. Lean into it at this point.
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:35:50
This is absolutely wonderful.

Ah the worst president in the history of presidents. Sad days for Murrica.
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:21:41
You're.

I feel bad for the russian people suffering in that terrible country. Putin more concerned about crypto than actually feeding the people dying in his country. He's literally the worst thing to happen to russia since stalin. Hang in there, people of russia!
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:11:02
Sounds like one of our russian puppet presidents retarded comments. Sad.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:49:29
Too bad the infrastructure plan is only half what the russian puppet promised during his campaign (closer to 600 million). Another on his long list of lies. Must be hard being a trumper these days, trying to defend that moron has to be a full time job. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:25:50
Too bad the jobs just aren't out there unless you're living in a handful of cities in the U.S. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:29:09
The current russian puppet administration in the U.S. is so ineffectual that crpto regulation is the last thing on their minds. The orange russian is currently staring down the barrel of a grand jury subpoena and inevitable impeachment.
Crazy times in the U.S.

Greatest state in the union by far! Love you California! Keep leading the way!
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:54:29
They're too busy being completely ineffectual. No way could they deal with crypto regulation when trumps staring down the depths of a grand jury indictment and inevitable impeachment. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:51:24
You poor, poor individual. You came to reddit hoping for the true answer? 
Stay in school, please. Stay in school kid.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:28:27
You're delusional if you think cyrpto will exist in a world where the global banking system has collapsed. If the banking system goes, so does everything. Better just hope trump the russian puppet doesn't usher in the next great depression at Putins request. Only time will tell.
