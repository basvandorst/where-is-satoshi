Correct, but drivers license and ID card issuance as well as property tax collection are not actions of the federal government in the United States.

OP might not know this, but in the United States, government is largely decentralized. A county accepting Bitcoin is, at best, an agent of the state of Florida and not an agent of the US Government.

I agree. I'm not a bitcoin investor, but I have a client who likes to pay me in bitcoin for some freelance work. I tell people that is how I get paid and they literally have no idea what I'm talking about.

I get you, but people seem to ignore that Bitcoin only has the value that people ascribe to it.  It is literally distributed fiat. Scarcity only causes a rise in value if demand is consistent. If people decided they preferred to accept another cryptocurrency, Bitcoin would lose value.
I'm not saying that will happen practically, but it is something that the True Believers tend to ignore.
