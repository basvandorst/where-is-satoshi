Do you know basic economics? Supply and demand? There's a lot of demand to the space of a block, but limited supply because of the 1MB max block size. So the prices go up. Some years ago, 50 sat/b was priority. Now its 150 sat/b

Nah, I like SegWit

Opt out replay protection breaks compatibility with SPV and mobile wallets. It's already a pain in the ass to break compatibility with full nodes, so replay protection will make things even worse

Bcash has a bigger number of blocks because of the EDA exploit. The total proof-of-work is way smaller than BTC

What I don't want is to pay $100+ tx fee's. Sabotaging onchain tx is not cool

Who can define if my transaction is useful? No one can to this;
btw the difficulty auto adjusts, so if mining becomes too expensive, the hashrate will drop slowly until becomes profitable again

Thanks, i will make a comment supporting Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:29:17
Miners are nodes 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:47:51
Nope, I want to use bitcoin and have low fees. That is why I support Segwit2x. I also run a btc1 full node. I will not run dogecoin or some shit because I'm free to choose the currency and chain that I want. That is the freedom that bitcoin protocol provides
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:07:03
No, there is no minimum fee. There's even an option to make a feeless transaction, but probably it wont confirm
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:45:31
So a 2MB HF is bad, but throwing away millions of usd in equipament and implementing a less tested PoW algorithm is ok? lol
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:16:33
I use Bitwallet since it’s the best wallet in terms of performance and they let me choose multiple inputs/outputs and fees(since all wallets use broken fee estimators). UI is great. Unfortunately, there is no Segwit support and I didn’t find a announcement about it. Probably not coming soon.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:00:51
I will not follow that

They already use it. I'm talking of global adoption. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:55:57
Thanks Adam. I made my first Segwit transaction. ;)
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:30:12
Not a problem. I can buy a 2TB hard drive for $60
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:52:09
Small miners you mean small pools, right? Since an individual miners with 1 to 10 ASIC miners can’t realistically solo mine because of the extreme difficulty right now. Even small pools have million of dollars invested in equipment, so is silly to imagine that a pool can’t afford to buy a computer made in the last 5 years. About full nodes, there is not a problem right now. I run it with a Pentium G4560 and 8 gbs of ram and the it barely consumes 30% cpu and 500mb ram. Oh, and i run a lot of things in the background, so the cpu one is certainly lower

Segwit doesn't allow 4mb block size. This is the block weight. It's impossible to get a 8MB S2X block or 4MB S1X block.
Hard forks are decided by anyone. Anyone runs the software they want to
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:33:31
Wrong. Today 4MB's limit is a block weight limit, not block size. 
The same happens with Segwit2x: 2mb stripped block size limit and 8mb block weight limit
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:31:50
Only if you had that amount before 1st August 2017
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:18:26
I made a Segwit tx for testing with 1 input and 1 output and it was 340 bytes. Legacy transactions are 192 bytes for 1 input/1 output
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:07:30
Probably not much. CPUs are pretty fast these days and when the blockchain hits 2TB we will probably have 10+ core CPUs on the mainstream market(we already have 8 core with Ryzen 7 and 6 core with Ryzen 5).

Venezuelans doesn't have money to pay for expensive transactions. Their minimum wage is 250,531 BsF while 1 BTC = 75,000,000 BsF. Do some math and you'll know that they earn 0.00334 BTC/mo. In some days, fees regularly spike to 350 sat/b so it's not useful for them.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:28:35
This is not average. You clearly don't understand how Segwit works. 4MB is maximum ever allowed, IF we have a perfect 1MB of stripped block data and 3MB of signatures. It's almost impossible to achieve that today, since a block full with 1i/1o P2WPKH will have around 1.5 MB's and P2WSH, 1.8MB. To achieve anything above 2mb, we need a extremely large number of signatures. It will not happen in the near future, for sure. The average block size should be around 1.5MB-1.7MB for the near future and around 2-2.2 MB when we start using more multisig and Lightning. 2x is double that, so expect around 3 mb when the blocks become full 
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:21:06
This is extremely misleading. A lot of pools signed NYA after Consensus 2017. That's why we have 90-96% Segwit2x support every day over a month. Actually, only Slush is not signalling right now

I'm a user and I will not call the legacy chain as Bitcoin. You can't represent all users, mate
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:07:47
LOL I never seen this guy and he banned me. I regularly talk with Core devs like Alex Morcos and Pieter Wuille and neither has banned me, despite I support Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:37:38
I don't use multisig so I didn't know that. I only used p2pkh in my entire bitcoin life. If I used Bech32 the tx would be smaller(p2pkh)?
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:16:55
I don't know these. Can you send me a link or something? thx
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:04:15
LN isn't great for micropayments. I support Segwit and I think LN is useful, but you won't open a channel to pay something only one or two times. It's better to do onchain. Also, it's going to be highly centralized on hubs who have solvency to be the middleman between two LN channels
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:34:06
It was $0.01 a little time ago :(
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:17:33
So only use Segwit for txs with a lot of signatures? 340 bytes is a 77% increase in size over a legacy transactions. It's a massive difference. Bech32 helps with this?

If you spend more in fees than you do in your computer, there is a problem. Also, you guys are not going to change to reality. Most people don't care about validation of transactions or the integrity of the blockchain. Today they don't care if the government are spying on them, the banks making fractional reserve(fraud). The average consumer doesn't give a fuck about all of this and he doesn't want to know what a blockchain is. If you dream that everyone will run a full node at home, you are being delusional. Some people today only have a smartphone and a tablet/notebook with 120gb storage because they use iCloud/Dropbox to store files. They don't care what Apple will do with these files.
