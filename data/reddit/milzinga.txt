I'd love to, but coinbase decided it was a great time to remove all my buying limits, and refuses to let me request more. No idea wtf is going on with them. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:13:43
No it's not. If you held onto many of those stocks until today, you'd have a fortune...
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:48:27
Even with the multi dig wallet? They the self advertise you control the private keys with using the. But I want to access my bitcoin gold and can't figure it out. I tried sweeping the “private key" but nothing comes up in my btg wallet

So much this. My brother has been sending me photos if the drops all day. He's just all butt hurt cause he didn't buy it at 2k, when I told him to
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:30:57
Coinbase really pissed me off by totally removing all buying ability since last week. Don't know wtf happened. My buying limits were removed and I still don't have it back. Really wanted to buy yesterday at 9500 but couldn't

This is a bummer. Will the lightning network fix these issues? When's that supposed to be active anyways? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:29:18
I thought Segwit wasn't going to be implemented, how come we want coinbase to do it? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:40
What is the lightning network and when will it be implemented.
There is a strong debate going on with Bitcoin and Bcash. Fees have been high and wait times have been longer with Bitcoin lately, which is a strong reason people like Bcash. What's a valid argument that Bitcoin is better?

It was also declining for decades before that. And violent crime has risen dramatically since the gun ban.

you mean after $4000 is finally worth less than 1 bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:55:56
Is it really that bad reusing address? I have an address linked to a hard wallet that i use often to send cash too for long term storage.

Mark Cuban maybe? He's been talking about buying some lately. That's change for him.

ViaBTC is quite a bit lower than cyrptocurrency.com. How come? Trying to unload mine there

What so you mean auto converted?

I have my BTC stored in Exodus wallet. Can I export my private keys to electron and just export my BCH whilst keeping my BTC in Exodus? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:25:49
What did you get for it? I have mine at viaBTC and it's trading around .15 BTC to BCH, wondering if I should hold out or bite the bullet. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:34:56
I've been using exodus wallet 
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:13:05
Thinking of doing that now at viabtc as well.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:45:16
Dang. To sell or not to sell. No idea what to do
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:37:34
So every time you receive BTC, should you back up a new private key?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:17:33
How do you time lock?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:30:27
Sweet thanks. The keys are linked to both btc and bch right? Does electron give you the option of choosing what to export then? How does that work?
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:37:05
Quick question, I have my bitcoin on a Trezor with the seed backed up and I stamped the seed into a metal sheet . If I lost access and recovered to another Trezor, will the seed still all be the same and secure so I don't have to do it again?
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:25:32
I thought so, I suppose that makes sense because anytime I update my Trezor I essentially wipe the device and recover using the seed. Could I recover using any wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:38:15
Could you imagine btc at $384,400? My God that number seems insane. How amazing that'd be
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:35:24
No one knows. Enough questions about this. Read the subreddit. Everyone on here asks the same questions. No one knows where it will be. Just like a year ago and a month ago no knew where it would be!! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:26:19
No one knows of course. It's all speculation
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:53:43
And the rates and fees are god awful. Don't understand why anyone would use them
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:30:22
Yeah pretty much. Didn't realize how much of chode he was 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:01:28
Thoughts on this? Obviously he is a BCH apologist, but he has some interesting points? Is BCH really the future? Why or why not? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:59:25
I'm currently using a multisig coinbase vault. Even if coinbase fails or gets hacked I should still have access to my coins correct?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:28:09
Well it's true that bch is faster and has less fee's...
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:20:46
I think I've had this happen to me. A few years ago I accidentally sent bitcoins to an email that didn't exist. Never saw them again. Coinbase says they sent it back but I can't find the transaction anywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:46:27
Great! Now where the heck is my bitcoin I bought a month ago! Their customer service is such a joke. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:13:42
Yeah that's the crux of storage. Digital storage is obviously safer if you ever lose access to your seed, but it's obviously more susceptible to being stolen.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:27:12
Yeah that's what I'm leaning towards. Better not risk losing out on potential money if coinbase won't support it. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:50:51
What constitutes as a significant amount?
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:34:09
What alts are you mining? I've been trying to get into that myself, no idea where to start. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:11:51
I have my coins in a coinbase multisig vault and control the keys. I backed them all up as well. I control the coins, correct? Or should I still move everything to a hard wallet? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:39:29
Even though I have the private keys?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:38:59
well all I can say is I'm pretty stoked I bought in at $2700 last month...ugh
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:52:45
I don't know a single Republican who would support a ban, but I know several Democrats who think it should be gone. In general the right is for *more* freedoms and the left is for *more* regulation.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:47:01
I have exodus wallet. How would I do this using that?
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:49:21
Yep, figures he's a D. They are constantly fighting freedoms and increasing regulation.

You're not wrong but it's not *that* different than cash or gold in terms of "stupid proof". I think a huge help in terms of adoption would be the regular usage of smaller units. 1 btc worth 8000 is too much to think about and control easily. You lose that and you're screwed. But 1 mbtc worth $8 is no big deal and like working with cash. Hopefully we'll get there sometime.
