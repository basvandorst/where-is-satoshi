"Disclaimer: I have a decent sized order with BFL.
It sucks that their chip came out using more power and they have to redesign their boards, cooling, and power. There are risks developing brand-new unproven hardware designs, and these things take time. I do believe they are getting there but I am not happy that its taking so long. However, I am an engineer and have seen this happen at nearly every company in every market. The only difference here is that BFL has our money up front.
My understanding is that anyone that has asked for a refund has gotten their money back.
The other ASIC vendors are profiteering heavily artificially limiting supply until BFL ships." 
Whow! The nerve. You're in on it.

Everyone, meet Delivery Man.
Delivery Man, whatever happened to that lot of BTC COO gave you to "day trade from LTC to USD"? What is "day trading" when it comes to a currency? Seems like laundry to me.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:57:29
I appreciate your rightness. I should tell you though: it's highly likely these users spreading FUD are sockpuppets doing Netsolus' bidding.
We actually had a meeting once where the COO asked for help sockpuppeting the bitcointalk forums to remedy negative PR presented there.

It's not a damn "cloud", you dolt.

See, the whole problem here is that you ask for evidence on the premise that what I've already presented is not itself evidence. So, if I give you more information I seem to stipulate that what I've already given isn't of value, which is false. You're asking a loaded question.
Additionally, "If this were a court of law" you'd be an anonymous heckler in the crowd and the court would not recognize you. Because you aren't able to be held responsible for the consequences of lying and it isn't clear where you're coming from. 
Are you affiliated with the defendent? Are you an expert on Bitcoin mining security? Did you also work at Netsolus? Are you in any way positioned to benefit from the impeachment of the witness' character? Why should the court accept your insults to the witness' character? Why is the evidence presented not enough? What qualifies you to judge the validity of the evidence they present?
I, Francis Crow, worked at Netsolus adminstrating their Bitcoin network. My duty, as an admin, is to the clients that entrust me with their property and information. I upheld this duty at Netsolus despite doing so being personally and financially disadvantageous to me. I have nothing to gain from lying. For these reasons I am a knowledgable and trustworthy source in this matter.

It wasn't a cloud. Their new product is though.

Doesn't posting such information violate reddit's rules? These aren't servers they're Bitcoin ASICs.

Saying you're "transparent" and then throwing out soft, useless numbers that have nothing to do with those records of the workings of a company called **books** does not impress me. 
Where's the balance sheet for this business? The inventory? The serial numbers of machines? The client information? How is that even kept? Is it secure? In what way is it secure, like non-attributable, secret, what? 
For any machine, who owns it and how can you be sure they're mining on it? How many watts are they getting, not on average, but for each client? What is the hashrate and acceptance rate of each machine (remember, you could intercept valid work and claim it as your own)? When is this?  "and ~12GH when our Neptune arrives!" 
There's no architecture which assures me that the hardware arrives when you say, submits the unique work you say, gets the power, cooling, and shelter it deserves, or even is what the client ordered in the first place.

Why are you concerned with what evidence I have against ~~you~~ Netsolus?
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:03:30
It's obivous your bias is toward Netsolus. And I still don't see a name, coward.

Stop insulting me.

Indeed, the line between Netsolus and BFL, I don't think it exists. Netsolus hosts BFL hardware exclusively.
I alerted the SEC because of thier new offering: mining contracts.
When I was there, all machines that came into Netsolus were immediately set mining on behalf of Netsolus. And they were only handed over to clients when they started to complain too loudly. At one point there was an actual memo. Something to the effect of:
Whenever you need to set a new client mining, go upstairs to the Crow's Nest, unplug one of the devices mining on WhiteMountain, and hook it up to a different controller for the client. All "spare" machines should be mining on WhiteMountain. 
Still, to this day, I can't believe they had the nerve to tell us such highly priced machines could be "spare." In reality these were machines that should've been mining for clients, but weren't for whatever reason. Either they weren't complaining enough, or there existed some plausible reason their hardware was down.

I've got files here that show all the hosts I could set up a key pair with, and how many devices they have connected to it, on Decemeber 28th, 2013. Two lists: One which shows which controllers the clients are assigned in the help desk documentation and one of which shows what those controllers are actually mining on and how many usb devices are being used to mine. WhiteMountain is in these files.
I don't think that I can share this. Seems a breach of trust with the clients. Perhaps you could think of a way to share the private credentials of a few hundred clients in a way that doesn't piss everyone off? Please?

I care about this post, not you.
I know the semicolon looks loony; a high school composition class will ease your troubles.
I'm not going to let you minimize the evidence that I've presented. The workers are real. That's not "zero evidence." My account is true, I put my name behind it. 
If this were a court of law (by the way, it's not, it's Reddit) I'd be called a "witness." That's another big word like "semicolon." Stay in school! ;D

I've created a separate post.

The clients own the hardware and place it under the care of the company. It seens if this were any other collocated computer system the answer would be obvious: borrowing without asking is stealing. But "Bitcoin' seems to provide a smokescreen which distracts from this very basic concept.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:40:54
WhiteMountain and taran are real workers (or were, haven't checked after publishing this) in slush's pool. The Eligius account is also real, and traceable to Netsolus via the block chain. 
Of course, that's not what you're after. You're not actually looking to reveal evidence but to conceal it; going around to various exposes and trying to rattle the OPs and find out what they've got to give. Who are you?
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:14:27
What exactly is your "business"? This isn't ordering pizza with friends. What are the numbers? What's the cash flow look like?
This isn't complicated. It's just specific. When a client gives you money/hardware, where does it go? How does it eventually turn profit? Who is responsible? And, one day, when the bills pile high, and you've a gaggle of golden geese at your disposal, what's going to stop you from using them? 
"Trust me" is not enough to run a mint.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:59:41
I have provided the workers and my account of why they should be looked at, as well as reason you should listen to me. Netsolus' IP is public information. I've given you the money. This is why you're lazy. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:53:53
Care to put your name behind your trolling?
I don't give a shit what you say because you haven't qualified why it's important I should. 
I on the other hand worked at Netsolus, pulled the logs from the Bitcoin network there, and everything else you already know from my article. Because I am Francis Crow and you are a nameless critic oddly poised against people like me; perhaps exactly opposed to specifically me. I am the evidence. Who the fuck are you?
It seems odd that an earnest Redditor would abuse the OP in this way. It's especially odd that this would happen on where Redditors look for information to help them as there is certainly a lack of representation of clients in these operations. If you're an honest Bitcoin miner, you're biting someone trying to help you. And I just don't buy that someone smart enough to use cryptocurrency is dumb enough to obscure information that helps them do so safely.

You're definitely just trying to get a rise out of me. I apologize to the forum for endulging you but I found it necessary to reiterate that I've already presented evidence.
"Badgering: counsel is antagonizing the witness in order to provoke a response, either by asking questions without giving the witness an opportunity to answer or by openly mocking the witness."

Wait a minute, what if I did keep a copy? Then you'd be saying I forged it. 
It's never enough. I'm done. I did what I could. No one wanted to work with me to right this. You're all a bunch of lazy, greedy, unloyal assholes and I'm very sorry that I ever helped any of you.

"I haven't stopped to figure the costs yet (or pay the credit card bill for space &amp; power), but I can say we are still a ways off from making any money."  
You can't keep your own books and you purport to keep those of others? What're your standards and policies and review procedures? Oh my.
