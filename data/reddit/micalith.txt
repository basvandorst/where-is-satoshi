yup. It's on the downturn now
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:09:10
it's insanely low BTC prices are too tempting for arbitrage though. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:01:06
OK. I was hoping I'd missed something regarding bank transfers. Maybe we can't do them after all then
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:26:47
ah. I should have noticed. Seems hardly worthwhile (or risky) to be bidding like that right now. I would have thought that the price won't rise much more since allot of people are set to sell in anticipation of a downturn.

there's no wire transfer option on btc-e for depositing USD. Only the ones I listed. Though I noticed the btc-e FAQ mentions wire transfers, they are not an option when you go to deposit USD. Had a look around the site and can't fine any bank transfer details

[ ] The fuck are you talking about? The price is only going up from here.
[ ] The price will remain relatively consistent for the foreseeable future.
[ ] $75 - $100
[X] $50 - $75
[ ] $25 - $50
[ ] &lt;$25
Then, assuming no 51% catastrophe (like a government or bank collective buying out pools), gradual increase over long period.  51% thing really concerning me at the moment though...

and it only dropped $2!
Bitstamp and Mtgox have contracted out ddos attacks upon themselves to prove that the bitcoin market is robust and ready to be adopted as a currency.

@_date: 2013-04-18 23:33:30
btc-e have problems. Best to wait and see if they recover OK
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:15:15
Everyone's learning not to panic sell, so the attacks are fast becoming pointless. Mtgox dropped less than 3% in reaction to the bitstamp attack.
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:07:07
absolutely. Bitstamp seems to be holding it's own fairly well. They're not any lower than would have been expected from the slope of the downturn which started 12 hours ago. Ddos or not, it's sell time anyway
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:53:14
I submitted a market BTC sale 20 mins ago and it's still 'Pending'! 
is it because there is nobody there trading, or because their systems are suffering?... 
@_date: 2013-04-19 09:30:43
oh... woops
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:34:18
erm, no I don't actually. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:27:27
but you need Java to see the charts at bitcoincharts.com and bitcoinity.org
@_date: 2013-04-21 09:27:22
best to use both mtgox and bitstamp for redundancy, in case one gets incapacitated. Bitstamp volume has been good enough for me to do limit orders for around 10BTC. I don't know about larger orders
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:06:01
Yup. It took just over a week for the bank transfer to clear into mtgox. Bitsamp were 2 or 3 days as far as I can remember. And after today's mtgox ddos attack, boy am I happy not to have all my eggs in one basket! 
edit: If you're confident with BTC transactions, you might actually do better to buy BTC in the UK and transfer them from your wallet to the sites you decide to trade on. It would be much much faster, and you wouldn't have to loose out on £ to € fees and exchange rates. try these:
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:41:39
thanks. I'll keep trying to clear cache, restart etc
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:23:56
any minority of panic selling was insignificant in the long run. This robust recovery in bitcoin value just proves that it's about ready to be adopted by the market at large.
@_date: 2013-04-19 09:05:00
It's been doing this every time it reaches a landmark. It happened at $100, $110, just below $120, and now $130. Selling, then re-buying after sharp price drops.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:45:05
ahhh. peace of mind. Thank you!  
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:03:12
But if the attacks are only transient, and always recover quickly, this shouldn't hinder the exchange of BTC for goods should it?
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:29:40
I don't know enough about hacking tech. If it's a hack, might all our BTC and dollars be stolen? Does anyone know if mtgox is insured for that?
