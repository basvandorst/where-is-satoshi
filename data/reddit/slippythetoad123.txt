I'll have to look into POS, this seems like an interesting idea

Basically my comment on decryption was based on my understanding that mining is basically brute forcing the SHA-256 hash. I would think something that could do that, could also be easily re purposed towards another problem that needed computation power (brute forcing people still using SHA-0?).
I did learn from another post though that I didnt fully understand the private key portion of transactions so that lead to some misunderstanding

So I'm not the only one...

What if the goal isn't an attack...but just control.  And not to be stupid, but I would think even without BTC a state sized actor would have other uses for a massive amount of computer power that can be directed towards decryption, so the investment isn't lost.

Thanks for the clarification. I did overlook the private key aspect of BTC. That at least mitigates some of my concern. 
Seems however there is still some incentive in exclusive ownership of the mining rewards and transaction fees as well as being able to shut down BTC transactions if the actor deemed it beneficial.
Thanks for the reply!

To collect transaction fees? Also would it be a surprise if China wanted that level of control over something?

Actually this also makes me think of another possibility...what is such a farm already exists, either botnet or government skunkworks...It would take also no effort at all.
