Cus this is not taken BCC into account
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:56:19
Nothing. If internet is down, people can't buy nor sell, value doesnt change.

I assure you the Chinese know exactly what they're getting into, since I read news from both English sites and Chinese sites. It's more like the other way around that u have no clue (and won't even try to understand) why BCH was created in the first place. Pure racism.

Let me guess how ppl answer a vague question like that,
1) HODL.
2) HODL.
3) HODL.
Right, HODL.

I withdrew w them just fine, wait for the confirmations

Well you probably know better but if you live in japan how can u never see one?! I'm just on a trip here day 3 and visiting I'd say "regular tourists" places, and these bitcoin signs pop up so often! 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:34:47
I am on vacation at Okinawa, a small island of japan, very suburban place. I've seen at least a dozen places accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, I feel I could survive solely on BTC here!
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:29:52
No! It's a random pharmacy at AEON mall. I didn't really pay attention to these bitcoin payments till after my wife told me, why don't u just pay w ur frigging precious Bitcoin, lol!
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:17:45
Coin vs coin is a better comparison. I can't think of a reason why I would ever need to search visa

Ya man that's the one haha! I was at their Apple Store doing trades on their MacBook cus my cell had connection problems :D

Bitcoin always beat ethereum, what's your point? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:21:08
Do you get manipulated by strangers?
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:09:15
No worries, I reacted cus I'm having a shit day too, cheers bro.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:03:04
I have no idea why people use coinbase still, if you frequent ethtrader you'll see how convenient "network problem" is, whenever ETH dips, coinbase goes down and you cannot buy, almost every single time.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:57:25
When the mess ends, price will be at ATH and you'll think shit, I'm too late to join the party

This current BIP 91 lock in was a no brainer, even if it does not happen in the first period, it will in the periods to come before the deadline. Since most people knew this, they had already purchased in, hence the price increase happened before the actual lock in.
Now FOMO buyers will be limited, since the price has already reflected the lock in, and that many traders including algo trades taking profit today (buy the rumor sell the news), the price is settling at what it is now, demand and supply seem to come to an equilibrium.
In the next month or so, before the actual activation, I think the price will just consolidate sideways, and a major rally (up or down) right before the activation, depending on chainsplit or not.
So sell or not is up to you, but if you believe BTC civil war will eventually peacefully resolve, I'd say hold on to your positions and wait at least till segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:24:18
This article was from days ago, they just labeled it as if it just came out today, lame.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:21:57
They publicly announced that they will signal BIP91 today, and today it's technically too difficult to deploy. Meanwhile all other miners who wish to signal have signaled. History will remember slush pool and f2pool are the major miners who go against majority consensus to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:07:24
Believe in results, not what people tell you. Signaling BIP 91 is not rocket science, not to slush not to any other pools. There will always be excuses when it comes to market manipulation.
Why is it so easy for others to signal but not them? Or are they just technically incapable? Either way I'm never ever using their service just for outright lying about signaling today.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:23:54
So you clicked their publicity blog post from google results. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:05:59
I am not sure but I went ahead and did it anyway 
[You can see my post about the process here](
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:58:10
They announced on WeChat that they will start signaling for BIP91, it's just not rolled out yet but we can expect their support hopefully in time for this period and clear all market uncertainties.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:59:59
So a random tweet from a nobody w 0 basis and false information (ViaBTC has been around for over a year), who should I believe uhmm
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:56:33
Not really.
ETC/ETH split, combined value was higher.
Current futures trading, BTC has another 12% room to drop, else combined value is still higher.
At this stage one can only speculate, nothing's guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:42:46
Its assumption, not fact. Think of it as stocks giving out dividends, combined value is theoretically the same before the event, but in reality it can be higher or lower depending on how the market reacts. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:23:09

Bankers are people, it's the banking system we are getting rid of
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:09:08
Thanks for amplifying my point. And yes it did :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:29:46
I'd go a step back, if a clone of BTC by the Chinese is considered shitcoin, why isn't LTC a shitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:09:41
Reddit is always most resourceful, I'll be monitoring exchanges that offer BCH/BTC pairs
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:09:31
I thought that a smaller unit for BTC would be better for mainstream adoption, since buying things with 0.000024 of a coin is really difficult to tell what the cost really is. An equivalent 1:1 USD unit will be convenient, but then given the nature of BTC and its volatility, the newly formed unit becomes obsolete once price reaches higher level. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:51:11
So you mean it can only go up? Selling is a crime or something?
Jesus ppl stop looking at 5 min charts, calm the fuck down.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:45:06
I'm pretty sure you got that sentiment from google search, that was my impression w them at first too. 
And no it's not that they haven't made the decision, they announced signaling today in public, and pulled out w "serious stability" bs last min. All miners can smoothly signal but they can't? I believe in what I see, and they are along w f2pool are the miners actively going against BIP91. They account for the majority of those 20% non-bip91 signals is a fact.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:44:29
[Here's another thing you can do before the fork](
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:38:20
Wait it out, stop looking at 1m charts.

Stop adding Bitcoin to it, it's just Bitch.
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:26:20
If your counter takes BTC why do you need another ATM? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:56:27
it's back to 2630 already, during wknds when vol isn't as high as usual, sell orders sometimes create dips before buy orders jump in. It's not out of the ordinary, not like a flash crash.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:22:16
Worlds biggest mining pool w a bit of luck, fair game
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:43:24
Prior to Aug.1 you don't have a lot of choices, but after the HF there will be exchanges supporting BCC, I just saw Kraken decided to support it so you can exchange there afterwards.
