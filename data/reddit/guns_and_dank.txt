You haven't actually used Bitcoin though, you just sold something and bought BTC and have been holding it based on speculation. If you now turned around and bought a new car and paid using BTC, that would be the type of story they were looking for.

I've got a buddy that used to buy nearly all his drugs off the deep web using Bitcoin and the TOR network.

If I keep my BTC/LTC/ETH on a Trezor, does it really matter which exchange I buy from?
Does Gemini have an app? Don't see one for Android unless I'm missing it

I have an app called Quit Cannabis that tracks days sober, time regained, and money saved. I'm certain there's similar apps for cigs

Ok I just got my trezor in the mail today, will open it up tonight when I get home. I assume it will come with instructions on how to transfer from GDAX into there. But got any pointers or things I should know? Are the instructions pretty straightforward?

The kid in red on the right is holding onto what looks like a concrete wall. If the flyer were to come in contact with that it'd be game over for him, they have no mat on that side.
They're obviously reasonable talented young gymnasts, and have been practicing this move for awhile. They throw the one mat down to break and slow down his fall. Otherwise he's have just kept bouncing a few more times.

I don't think "dumbass" is the right term for him. He may have gotten greedy and carried away and careless, but what he built and did takes a pretty high level of intelligence.

Someone's gonna make a profit, why not opportunistic individuals over this store?
