goddamn these posts are getting ridiculous you gave a company 40,000 when they just introduced millions of new customers to there no prepared system?!? lololo
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:04:24
if the company know they aren't up to standards of peoples demand they should stop taking in business.. obviously the people going into business with them do not know about the fact that Kraken isn't reliable. A non shady company would severe all ties with the issues they are creating not taking in more money from people who have not been warned.. in every sense of the matter its shady business dealings to admit you are unfit for business but to continue doing business.

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:43:34
a company who tells people to use their competitors but still accepts business should be described as shady... lol

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:40:05
was in the same boat a couple years ago.. go to and look through the investing posts good place to start. learned a lot about smart investing and budgeting over there
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:34:06
be very careful i would invest 900 in some safer investments and then go hard with 100 in these very volatile markets such as bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:09:36
any way you could tell me which of these work best for you.. I would love to get away from gdax and coinbase but dont want to spend hours looking through all these exchanges finding the lowest fees etc...
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:42:56
i understand 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:55:33

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:41:02
how do you know this??
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:31:48
what about when you are transfering from gdax to the ledger
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:49:46
ya just looked and saw that gonna get a ledger for him thanks for all the help.. another question I have in general is do all these companies have delays on depositing money into your account and getting your coin to you reasonably fast?
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:30:14
awesome thanks. pretty easy to set up?? and would any version do or do we need to keep up to date with newest hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:50:01
in this market you cant go wrong with an index fund that follows the S&amp;P 500 or the DOW. If you do not want to do that mutual funds are your next best bet, as you can give money to a firm does all the work and buys a pool of stock say Google, Apple, Microsoft for example or they go with other industries. It is just an easier way to get a return on the huge companies without having to buy a single share of that company for hundreds of dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:06:09
cool cool makes sense. 
what are the fees associated with gdax
when i transfer from my bank to my gdax account is there a fee?
and then when i transfer from gdax to my personal wallet is there one as well?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:30:30
misleading title 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:30:24
