Yeah it took me 4 hours to get my coins into my wallet. It was crazy

Yeah a little part of me was hoping the fees would be lower by chosing Bitcoin. Kind of like when you chose to get a gift card. One day we'll get there. In the mean time I guess its time to dust off the old coin roller again

Update:  The bank said that my $9.58 charge to Panera on my paypal account was suspicious so they assumed the card was stolen. . .even though coinbase is the only purchase that has been blocked (not even my $400 newegg purchases )

Most televised news is garbage now a days
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:31:53
Right?! Imagine how many "$1600!!!" "$1700! " And "$1800"  posts we would have seen yesterday

Maybe we should sticky the new to Bitcoin thread at the top since sub growth is increasing . . I know it's the first thing on the sidebar but reading the sidebar wasn't always second nature for me when I first started on Reddit.

I know I need to switch banks too. Wells Fargo is garbage. I've made less in interest in the past 3 years than I have lost in a single ATM fee
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:45:36
It's Wells Fargo to coinbase. .  All from the same device. They keep telling me I will be cleared in the future but that only seems to last for a single transaction.  It's "in my best interest" apparently.

I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:52:52
Yeah even if it's just the word FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:35:02
That's what i've been doing. You're right , coinstar is a total ripoff . I just wanted to cut out the middleman

Just because you don't game doesn't mean he doesn't enjoy his purchase

My hair is a velociraptor. Thank you very much

I don't think he's trolling. I think he basically means. . .at the moment, you can buy things like food and other necessities anywhere with fiat and only a select number of places with bitcoin.
You can buy anything anywhere with fiat.
Right now Bitcoin is only as useful as the people willing to accept it.
Yeah banks suck, yea governments are in our pockets but we live in the world we live in
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:00:21
Oh I'm not by any means saying Fiat is amazing and a great way to go . It's riddled with problems and corruption, localized monopolies and annoying exchange rates . Bitcoin is awesome and solves a ton of those problems I definitely agree with you.  All I'm trying to get at is that Bitcoin is not adopted enough globally to completely bail on Fiat just yet. One day I'd love to get there, but for now, Fiat has it's uses.

How do you not get why people say hodl?

You only lock in your losses when you sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:09:14
I don't get what people are all up in arms over. It's really not that uncommon. You can't buy stocks with a credit card , you can't buy chips in a casino , you can't buy money orders or pay off your mortgage. You can't even buy a lap dance haha.  They don't want you buying money with borrowed money. (Or sex apparently) that's what a loan is for. . . Obviously all of these things have loopholes. . . You just have to find them

If it just rewords or reiterates an idea or topic that has already been said or is mentioned in the daily thread they probably got rid of it

What's in the box!
