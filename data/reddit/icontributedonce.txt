They obviously meant they couldn't buy enough to become wealthy. Don't be so pedantic.

The taxes are assessed based on the market value of the BTC you would have used at the time of purchase. Trading BTC for a car or home (or anything, including services) is considered a barter in the eyes of the IRS. So if you bought the car by trading BTC for it, the taxes would be linked to whatever the market says the BTC you traded would be worth at the time of trading.

Yeah prison is no bueno. I️ wouldn’t ever mess around on big money. Pay your taxes and live your life. But people dabbling in little money? Well... they SHOULD pay their taxes too. But I’m not their dad either.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:23:16
Same if you haven’t traded or cashed out your crypto either. Just buying and holding BTC you don’t have to pay any tax.

If you lost money then you can claim it as a loss on your taxes. Two way street.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:46:58
Well, “How would they know?” Is quite the question isn’t it? How WOULD they know until you cashed out or you voluntarily reported it?
It is indeed a headache. It would be pretty difficult for them to just KNOW if you owe taxes on crypto gains though... huh...
Well, be a good boy/girl and pay your taxes ��

“Sell” as is ever trade it for any other coin or convert it to USD held in an online wallet/exchange like Coinbase without even actually withdrawing the money to your bank. These are taxable events. There are probably even more.

Glad I️ could help!

Not a tax attorney, but from what I know of it you would only pay on the fraction you took out. It all comes down to "realizing" the gains. If you only sell .25 of 1 BTC then you only "realized" .25 and the other .75 are not. Make sense?
I'm putting scare quotes around "realize(d)" because that word for the sake of the discussion has actual legal meaning.

I’m speaking specifically about crypto and capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:23:14
You aren’t paying taxes on the car. You’re paying taxes on the capital gains that you used to buy the car.

Heh... The shout out section praising Ver. Funny. This IS an old video!

Hey, history is history regardless of the present. We gotta remember what happened and where we came from.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:39:41
That's actually a really good question. I have no idea, but I could see the situation being some BS where you're still on the hook for the taxes but you also have to file your stolen money with the police or something and hope that they can get it back for you. Not sure if you can write off stolen money.
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:23:24
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for this!
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:22:59
Thanks so much for writing this all out! It makes a lot of sense and appreciate the insight.

I don’t really care what this guy has to say about anything. He’s a giant piece of shit. That’s all.
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:59:14
He wrote a book called Rich Dad Poor Dad that quite literally outlines what he saw as his own father’s shortcomings professionally (his dad was a professor at i think University of Hawaii, and apparently a good one too) compared to his friend’s dad that was a successful salesman. It’s just him putting his dad down for an entire book because he chose to go into academia instead of business and it all comes across as a petulant child who is envious of his rich friends life. That same book is now handed out by MLM “sales people” as essentially their holy scriptures as to why you should sell your soul to their screwed up pyramid schemes.

They do. I'm new/starting back up after a long while and read to use a Segwit wallet when I didn't really know what it was. Couldn't send the coins I bought on Coinbase to it. Then I read more and figured it out.
But yes they do support Segwit

But how do you balance the saved value of mortgage vs rent when you have to also factor in taxes on your property? I'm legitimately asking because my wife and I are weighing the pros and cons of renting vs owning in the shorter and longer term.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:14:51
Please let me know when you post it! I've been in and out of Bitcoin for the last few years (now wishing I had been more in than out), but some family and I are planning on really giving BTC a go. It'd be nice to get some good insight on how to get started.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:55:13
Oh just saw that you were OP. Obviously a sir, lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:23:17
Thanks, sir or madam! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:38:23
Is there a good start up guide for how to use this platform? I'm interested in it, but I'm not going to dive into it blind either.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:30:23
I also would like to know how you are building interest with your BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:31:08
What device are they using to mine? Can anyone explain the setup a bit? I wonder how much they're actually pulling down with what appears to be the one machine.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:59:07
I'm not bitcoin expert, but this guy is an idealist. For us laypeople using an exchange is how we get it. You'd have to lay down tens of thousands to set up a profitable mining outfit from scratch these days, and it can be extremely inconvenient to buy BTC directly from another person in a p2p transaction. Couple p2p with the general lack of security involved in a craigslist transaction and it's just makes more sense for newbies like you and I to use an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:03:04
So what am I supposed to do if I don't have a Mac. That guide is now kinda useless since many of the step involve using the Mac version of iTunes...

No one is going to lambast him for using IE?!
