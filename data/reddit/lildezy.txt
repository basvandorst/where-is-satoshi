Well said my friend, but one flaw of crypto to continue the discussion here. Is the fact if a power source were gone you would be unable
transfer and/or transact. A hard form of value/currency can function without this. I believe cryptos need an internet source to connect to the network hence another deficiency. And on the privacy coins etc.  Anything transacted digitally Is not feasible to be truly private. Anything can be hacked. It cannot until it is. I believe distributed ledgers will and can be hacked (likely are). Scarcity is another myth to a degree. When new white pages are created by the minute followed by a launch of another coin. With another purpose. With another setup. With another team lol blah blah. 
I see a mix of genuine excitement in crypto space, but one thing I see hugely missing mostly is informative talk. Message boards are surrounded with what appears young adults. Who have a sense of invincibility and arrogance over crypto currency. But the discussion is mainly HODL this and that. YouTube’s of crypto wizards faded talking “cup and handles” and charting graphs showing u when wave 1-1 million will go down lol...lets not BS ourselves and not call this for what it is. The price is a massive bubble. The revolutionary nature of the tech is there, but actually may have been highly highly exaggerated. I think crypto 100% has  a future and is most comparable to dot com bubble. But it is a bubble at these prices.  But it does not mean its not legit, its actually quite the opposite. But growing pains indeed....right now maturity is lacking in crypto. Its only about the next moon shot and a fast buck. I’m rooting for the idea to take form, and somewhat to see the twist and turns of crypto/whats in store next. And yes I’m sure some will say to the moon lol. See you in my
Lambo etc. pics of ur electronic car by elonsky musko. I get it....but maybe were at the club now
and its 4AM.

Call me crazy, but 0 is something I’m not betting on.

So I take it you missed out. Hoping it goes to zero. It will make you feel emotionally better about others making out on a bubble. But what happens 10 years from now when Bitcoin is still valued? .......... betting on zero IMO is outlandish as Bitcoin 1 million.

Back to reality...time for the long over due �� market? FUD!!! ��....”HODL” mantra going to be stress tested.

Never spend what u cannot lose. Rule number one.

I hope BCH hits market value. Lol

I tend to agree. The good of the tech is being eaten up by fees. Where is the utility? Peer to peer more expensive compared to a bank wire? At this point all in on a digital gold play...good luck. I find more and more use in a Litecoin or even ether. Other techs that focus on quick/low cost transactions. That to me has a bigger future.

Agree on the technology. But Wall Street will take that. The very creature BTC was made to kill. When you buy BTC your not obtaining an ownership share of BTC. Ur buying into faith of its value today will be more tomorrow. Hence is based on full faith of BTC and its specific blockchain  tech. I �� and call me crazy that value is vulnerable. Its a poker game. To me the original holders are trying to size up the global
appetitive to decide risk/reward of pulling the rug out and cashing out. Most these cryptos and including BTC have skewed proportion of ownership interest in too fews hands. Its not about the tech. Its a mania about getting rich quick. IMO, when the mania ends. The strong will arise and be valued at what it is at that point. Maybe it will have a future as a commodity. Todays price may be 20 years ahead of its time. Who knows. But todays game is dangerous IMHO.

This guy to me and going off strictly my gut and eye test is full of it. If he is going to flap his mouth  on BCH and its “fast and cheap” transactions/utility he is not even on the same level as other alt coins. Ether and LTC are both cheaper and faster from direct experience. Fear mongering people and promoting a run on BTC on live national TV is clearly not most ethical thing. This dude is a criminal in geeks clothing. Roger Ver is no nothing Jesus. He is simply s criminal.

Yea, not many people can catch a millisecond dip. “HODL”
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:11
Boom, get the mainstream out. Sell it mofos. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:56
Thats how I see it. It makes most sense to buy and hold like a special baseball card. The value is based on 100% faith in the system/ledger. Like a fiat it hates. The value within itself is truly a perception. One day it could be nothing more than an encrypted email with a history attached to it. I have a hard time betting on that value. The tech sure. BTC itself. A high cost low utility digi email w/chain and signature to make it urs. I leave it to those with common sense to figure it out.

HODL end of story

“Coordinated bitcoin dump”  &lt;==== all that needs to be said.

Bitcoin is a faith game now. Its tech will be used and has market value. Buying a BTC is a digital collectors items. High fees and high cost.  Its digital gold...art....baseball card.  It is valued globally and is based on the credibility of the peer to peer infrastructure. Americans last to the race. I tend to not see a long term future in the value of BTC. I believe around 1-2K hold 55/60% of coin. Not to say it will be useless. Nobody knows, but its fair to say price now is a game of who holds longest. Everyone is trying to time the bubble. But same time want to believe in it.  I will throw fun money. But better of working in the real economy for my money. Get rich quick happens on reddit. But when u go outside or meet people u see it less :).
