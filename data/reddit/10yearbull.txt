Do you remember the whole gaddafi fiasco? The reason was he was assassinated was because Libya didn't wanna play ball with the US. They started amassing massive amounts of gold to try and trade oil for it. We killed him for that. It was not because he was a brutal dictator or anything like that. The US supports something like 60%+ of the world's dictatorships.
Essentially once we got off the gold reserve, the USA had to peg the dollar to something. So we made a deal with Saudi Arabia that meant that you are only able to buy their oil with USD. That is referred to as the Petro dollar. 
It doesn't matter if the euro or the GBP is worth more than a dollar. At the end of the day, if they want to buy oil, they need to use USD. If they were to try and get away from that system, then that's when you'll see the US start to flex. This is what most people mean by saying that the USD is backed by the US military. 
This is oversimplified but it's a decent recap, just do a Google search on the Petro dollar and you'll find out more than you ever need to know.

I've seen trans people working at places like REI, as chefs, and working in retail. Nothing wrong about that slow money. You can also copywrite stuff on Upwork or freelancer. There's a ton of stuff you can do. Good luck.

Bitcoin used to be more centralized than some of the other centralized block chains you are referring to. I am a BTC maximalist but decentralization is a goal not necessarily always a state being IMO. Otherwise I agree with you since most alt coins don't solve an actual problem.

My unethical advice if you wanna get crypto without telling your family about it then look for freelance jobs on the internet and request pay in Bitcoin. Look up a fake resume, make a.fake name but take something you think you can handle like copywriting or maybe learn to code.
