It's likely they would do that, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't try to push the mining chip as much as they could, though.

Exactly. 
Mobile phone penetration in the PH is beyond 100%, and smartphones gradually taking up more and more of that pie, most people (if not everyone) uses the internet in some form or another, and even without your own personally-owned internet connection, you can rent out a connected PC at more or less $0.34/hour (~ Php 15.00). The PH is one of the best places for Bitcoin and Crypto in general to thrive. 
My dad, who is probably one of the least internet or technologically dependent people I know, when I told him about how bitcoin works, said "*Ilang taon lang, mauuso yan dito.*" ("After a few years, that will get popular here"). If someone like him could get it, I'm sure the rest of my countrymen would get it, too.

This is only to enable people to participate in OB without having to run a full node. While it might not be a fully decentralized solution, it doesn't stop you from running your own OB node to take full advantage of the P2P aspect of the network.

EDIT: On a more serious note, you're correct in saying that it's great for prototyping and small scale applications, but that doesn't mean it can't work for distributed services. There are now bytecode compilers for Python, and implementations that have JIT in them. That, and the fact that there is a very active and alive opensource community behind python means that things could be done faster (and better), given enough people to actually code it.

It is just a blog piece, so the author has that, but he also brought up MIT's recent move to replace their SICP program (and their course programming language, Scheme), with a robotics program taught with python.

Openbazaar aims to give people a platform that would allow them to be able to participate in global commerce without having to pay "gatekeepers" and be subject to their definitions of what's allowed and not allowed to be exchanged.
No more having to fight eBay or Alibaba about selling fireworks, or getting that reasonably-priced medicine from overseas that could spell the difference between life or death.
We are not completely abandoning Tor, i2P or any other anonymization protocols, we just have more reason to believe that we must first get a working product that people could use first. Because a decentralized marketplace *needs* to exist.

(i'm not sure if this is what you meant by "Pay wall") A Buy / Sell Wall is a group of buy or sell orders on an orderbook exchange that, because of its volume, is not immediately filled. They create "price slippage", which means the price slightly shifts up or down, depending on the amount of pressure the buy or sell wall is able to create. 
Arbitrage is taking advantage of differences in exchange prices in different exchanges for the same commodity in order to create a profitable trade.
*Example* 
Bitfinex BTC is at $230/btc
Bitstamp BTC is at $225/btc
An arbitrageur, a trader that participates in arbitrage, would sell his BTC on Bitfinex and use the money he gets to buy BTC at Bitstamp, giving him a profit of $5/btc.

You're correct in stating that banks are businesses and businesses are free to pursue profit and "close unprofitable ventures", that, along with your other point about paid bank accounts and a national banking system.
But, your catch-22 argument only demonstrates the fundamental flaw in fractional reserve banking as a business model, and that we, as free individuals, ought to be the custodians of our own assets, "internet tokens" or otherwise. I agree, it may be susceptible to theft, but it is inversely relative to how much care and thought you put into storing either your cash or your bitcoins.

Beta v0.4.0 is already out for Mac and Linux, which is truckloads more usable than the previous release, it includes a basic search functionality, enhanced networking libraries (most of which was developed in house), and better escrow implementation. 
You can certainly use it right now, just don't put in anything that you can't afford to lose, as there could be some bugs we still haven't splat yet.

I'm not sure if I read that question correctly....
Have I made any sales? No... : ( But that's because I'm still running the old client, work is eating up whatever free time I have. 
Has there been any sales in the network after the v0.4 release? No way to really know for sure, but you can get the feel for the amount of activity there by checking the amount of active nodes running the new client.
@_date: 2015-04-27 21:58:02

On a side note: This is actually easily remedied by just transferring the Btc you want to sell to an address you directly control and send it to bitquick from there.

Now, this I really have to disagree with. 
[OpenBazaar]( the DarkMarket fork, just started out between a conversation between Brian Hoffman and Sam Patterson on how DarkMarket could affect worldwide trade if given the attention it needs. 
[Subspace]( started out as a conversation between Chris Pacia and Mike Hearn.

Not really changing the price across all exchanges, but just changing the spot price in one exchange, like create a buy (or sell) wall, causing a difference in prices between exchanges, at which point their arbitrage bots could step in and put in a favorable trade for the aforementioned whales.

I noticed that too, scary, I know. For fiat-to-crypto and vice versa, we're proposing using a federated group of servers running a specialized client that would facilitate the deposits and withdrawals for fiat currency, and all orders would be broadcast using the Subspace protocol, which would go through a matching system. 
At a predefined date, the exchange "nodes" would settle their balances with each other using BTC, or something to that effect. We'll do our best to keep everything on the up 'n up and avoid anything that would result in the unnecessary release of info.
