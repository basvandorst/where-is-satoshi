I deposit my pay check into my exchange on Friday and buy on Monday afternoon, so far its worked out well enough for me rather than buying on Friday.

I spend 500$ weekly because that's what I could afford to do.  However last week I had 1k available so I put in 1k, I don't feel bad about that move even with this drop and will be purchasing 500$ worth tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:54:23
Hopefully not for another week or 2 I’ve got some dips to buy but first I need my pay checks to arrive.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:17:55
I've been buying 500$ weekly since February, and tomorrow will continue to do so until the end of the year.  I believe in Bitcoin and I'm looking forward to my 2-5 year returns, as opposed to weekly returns.

Being that I've been a member of this Site for 7 years, I'd say it's safe to say whether this sub is still around in 2 years I will still be.  
But I wholeheartedly understand why they would choose to trust a 2 month old master of projection instead.  Cheers mate, you've got nothing to lose.

Be sure to save this comment and message me for a handout in 2-5 years, don't worry I got you little doubting Thomas.
I'm not kidding either I've already insured a friend if he's not doubled his 1k investment in 2 years I will cover the difference.  I've never gone back on my word.
Buy Bitcoin and save the world :)

All I've got is common sense and data to analyze.

$300?!?!?!?  The Fuck kind of scam is this.

Or they are a bunch of shills desperately trying anything and all they can to ensure their alt coin survives.
But go ahead and leave your head in the sand conflating FUD with reality/facts wondering why reality is perpetually biting you in the ass.  Follow your own advice and face it, lest you continue your path of despair.

Bought in at 2k sold a few btc at 17k last December, been re buying with change weekly since 6k, even with this dip I'm way up my friend.  I've built back up to just over 3 coins now.   Been a great year, looking forward to another

^^ Exactly see this guy gets it.  FINALLY!  Can you believe he brought the entire gang?
Let's keep this comment train rolling to the moon baby!!

Isn't that kind of what currency trading is?
Anyhow, I only sold because I endured a home invasion and needed to cover some of the loss.  I'd have held on to it otherwise and endured this dip at a loss keeping same indifferent smile I am now.
Last I'm an advocate of the technology not because I believe in it, but because I can't see future currencies going in any other direction than crypto.  Also as a Sr. Network Engineer with 15+ years experience dealing with selling/deploying/migrating emergent technologies I understand the growing pains/pitfalls/resistance of any new tech solution. 
Bitcoin is doing nothing that it has not done before and people are continuing to spread the same exact FUD they did before.
I was gonna ask for your address and shoot you over some btc so you could get your skin back in the game, but I see now you are a reddittor for 5 days exclusively commenting FUD in this sub which means you are already getting paid :)

Wired 1k to my kraken yesterday will be using th balance on bitcoin as soon as it hits.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:28:41
Your comment doesn't add up.  If you aren't invested over your head then then coming up with a down payment shouldn't be an issue at all.  
If you just got in I can see you having enough for a down payment and trying to cash in on BTC at its bottom, then go ahead and cut your losses.  But as an exercise try to logically create a situation where BTC hits zero, when you realize that's not plausible go ahead and weigh out the benefits of a long term investment in a versatile utility and a technology that currently being embraced thru out the world at exponential rates versus copping out today.
FYI I don't recommend a down on the house unless you plan on dying in that house.  FIAT bumble icoming.

Basically if you are a technical dunce this is for you.  
I may be going a little hard.  There is a utility and this can help the crypto market.  This is just reminded me of the Kodi boxes that flooded the market at the same mark up.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:34:48
I believe it's because people are looking at bitcoin as gold and litecoin as silver versus it representing actual bitcoin gold.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:32:15
Just deposited 2k to kraken and will do another 3k tomorrow, should be able to afford an entire coin by then.  Buy bitcoin, save the fucking world.
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:06:44
Makes me feel good forgoing debt payments to but more bitcoin :))

Bought 0.15 BTC for 595.00 usd the other night, I typically wait until Monday to so I’ll be doubling down again NYE to close out 2018 saving the world!
