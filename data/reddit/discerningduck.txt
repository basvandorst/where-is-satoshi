Looks like the site owner is using a closed-source platform that hasn't integrated bitcoin into its service yet.  Open-source alternatives like woocommerce and magneto have long had bitcoin plugins available, but this Eventbrite company hasn't done it yet.  
So as a workaround, they're selling tickets with bitcoin directly using "buy with bitcoin" buttons instead of going trough the shopping cart feature.  Maybe none of the well-known ticket sale platforms like ticketmaster have integrated bitcoin. pretty big opportunity for the first one to do it!

Here's my take, from the other thread. Price will get smashed in the days and weeks approaching and following the halving.  FBI will begin dumping their 800,000 gox coins at a faster rate on the big exchanges in preparation for the largest bull run in bitcoin history.  The result will be a continuation of this "opposite land" price paradigm we've been in since gox was robbed.  I estimate the price to be sub 200.
It seems the strategy is to orchestrate a crash after each bull run to ensure each new bitcoin investor takes a loss, thereby dampening sentiment.

If you hate regulation, cool, so do I.  But you try running an exchange and doing no KYC...you'll lose your bank account and get shut down fast, maybe get served a big fine, and maybe go to jail if you let money laundering take place...that's all if fraud doesn't eat your business alive first.
Yes everyone wants decentralized exchanges, but there's not much sense in hating on those operating centralized, regulated (by force) exchanges in the meantime because they don't break all the laws you don't like at their own peril.
Thanks to cavirtex and all the other exchanges that are still in operation, Bitcoin is accessible until a better, more tyranny resistant mean of exchange is created.

Reddit isn't anonymous if the incentive to unmask a user is high enough.  If bitcoin goes to $100k, you can bet there will be lots of very smart people and perhaps some very resourceful institutions that will try to identify the large holders.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:49:15
You may find that a lot of them are very new accounts that only post content designed to discredit the community and the protocol.  Make no mistake, the banks hate bitcoin and want it to fail.  They have unlimited resources at their disposal to exploit any known or unknown vulnerabilities.  Seems probable that when a sophisticated attack against the community and/or protocol takes place, like we saw last fall, trolls are sent to in order to attempt to steer the narrative and spread FUD. Consider how easy it would be for an adversary with unlimited resources to enlist the services of an intelligence firm like Stratfor (as an example) to launch a disinfo campaign to coincide with a multi-pronged attack like what we saw this week.

That's short sighted. If they're making, say,  an extra 3% margin when people pay with Bitcoin as opposed to credit cards, with no risk of chargebacks, why not pass on 1% of those savings, in order to incentivize more people to pay with Bitcoin?

What good is it though if you're technically just pegging your wealth to the price of paper gold?  Personally I am expecting sub $10 silver and sub $1000 gold. However buying physical at that price will require 2-3 months for delivery and buying for immediate delivery will carry 30-40% premiums.
The manipulators are going to keep the comex prices down forever.  Metals will never explode in price on paper like so many metalbugs are expecting.  Rather, the physical market will completely unhinge itself from the paper market.  Unless bitreserve is able to track the physical price, this seems like a bad deal to me.  That would be similar to quoting the localbitcoins spot rate as opposed to a phony bitcoin ETF with no proof of reserves. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:02:34
The way I see it is bitcoin is blazing the trail, dealing with the regulators, banks, institutional investors and press.  Combined with the fact that bitcoins value has exploded, meaning lots of people now have a lot of skin in the game, and bitcoin is past the point where it can be fun and carefree like doge.  
The doge community keeps drilling into everyone's head that they're fun and friendly, which is great, they have found their niche, but bitcoin is doing the dirty work which paves the way for doge and other currencies.  If doge had to do this itself, their carefree and fun persona would go out the window quick.  
FTR I do own doge, but only because I'm not willing to be left behind if doge ever makes it to dollar parity or higher.

Good video grats on the machine folks.  But you can't hate on BitPay for not partnering with gun shops...they're vulnerable enough in an uncertain regulatory environment.  Staying in operation is challenging enough - their banking relationships are bound to be very fragile, so cutting out "high-risk" transactions goes a long way in maintaining cooperation from the banking sector...while that's still required.

Concerns me a bit that you're getting downvoted so much.  I agree with most of what you're saying.  I don't buy into this "even if DARPA created bitcoin, well it's open source so who cares"...NOPE.  If it emerges that DARPA or any 3 letter agency created bitcoin, I'd bail and convert my holdings to silver and gold.  Seeya. 
I'm as pro-bitcoin as the next guy, but I recognize that no group with consolidated power would design bitcoin with the long-term intention of vastly reducing that power.  What seems more likely to me would be that they would "buy off" anti-establishment &amp; libertarian folks en masse via a protocol originally touted as an open-source, decentralized alternative to corrupt central bank currencies.  Maybe they know full well that once adoption reaches a certain point, enough false flag exchange collapses and successful black swan hacking episodes would be enough to make the community clamour for enough regulation to stamp out any last resemblance of personal freedom and privacy that once existed in the unregulated version of bitcoin. 
Or maybe they might know the exact tipping point in the networks collective hashing power where they'd be able to gain at least 51%, ie. maybe they know that until the network reaches X hashes per second, they have a guarantee that once they turn on their dormant equipment, they could achieve majority, and make the changes required to fulfill their plans, be it changing the inflation schedule, elimination of privacy, or what have you.  Or maybe they could deploy their hundred billion dollar media apparatus to convince the masses that a coin validation scheme was the only way to preserve the personal freedom that bitcoin offers (sounds ridiculous, but consider that most people are lemmings)
It sounds ugly but this is what I would think if it were somehow confirmed that bitcoin was a government project all along.  I wouldn't be in the "it doesn't matter cause its open source" club.  Wouldn't ushering in a "one-world currency" (which they've long admitted is their ultimate goal) serving to further consolidate control held by the existing power structure require a huge degree of deception and social engineering? Given the growing mistrust of governments around the world, it seems reasonable that any transition from the ailing nation-state fiat currency paradigm to a single, global, IMF-controlled currency would have to be done under opposite pre-tenses, and grown until the point where "resistance is futile", say because all fiat alternatives have collapsed.  What better way to gain your opposition's support than to make your opposition rich through the early adoption of your new currency under deceptive pretences?
Now, I don't think bitcoin is a government project; I think that bitcoin's roots are genuine.  But I'm thinking of what it would be like to one day be made a billionaire through greater bitcoin adoption, but have this newfound wealth be contingent upon my continued support of bitcoin, if the protocol were to deviate from the core principles of this community, by yielding to the endless whims of regulators and banks. 
Am I alone in this line of thinking or can anyone empathize?

The new Greenwald/Snowden leaks confirm (for those that still choose to deny) that government most definitely does infiltrate online forums in order to steer the dialogue and suggest majority consensus on an issue.  Reddit moderators went to a great deal of trouble to censor the story from the front page, but hopefully most people here are aware of it. 
What seems likely to me is that the whole gox fiasco is another application of the Hegelian Dialectic.  Mark Karpeles was threatened with life in prison for money laundering / terrorist financing unless he could hand over the private keys to gox's cold storage wallets to US prosecutors, but only if he could convince people that the coins were lost because of another reason (transaction malleability).   They did this because the last thing they need is another huge stash of bitcoins, all centalized into 1 address that everyone knows and can watch, like in the instance of the DPR/SR1 theft.  The state doesn't want transparency into their bitcoin holdings, because then they can't use those coins to manipulate the market and create FUD amongst investors exactly when they need it.  Imagine a giant sell-off on the major exchanges, coinciding with a drain of the SR1 seized coins wallet.  Wouldn't go over too well.  
So they have a scapegoat (mark) which they're exploiting and making out to be either a devious thief or a careless buffoon in order to show people how much government regulation is needed in order to avoid sustaining further losses.  Now that many people have lost millions of dollars, and mark can't explain why because of the gag order, it's the perfect time to send in the shills/operatives to cry "please regulate us!!" on online forums.  Suddenly the bitcoin community doesn't look so libertarian.
Problem &gt; Reaction &gt; Solution.  They cannot risk something like bitcoin showing the world just how unnecessary state regulation of money now is.  So they will continue to engineer dramatic failures like mtgox until the majority of the community begs for the state to save them from bad actors.  
It might sound far-fetched, but this would be far from the first time something like this has happened.  Worse things have been done to justify the actions of the state.

Neither bitpay nor coinbase will give you a merchant account unfortunately.  You can accept bitcoin using any wallet software or a blockchain.info account (with 2FA!) but you'll need to handle the conversion yourself under a personal trading account somewhere.  You could exchange your BTC once or twice a day in batches, but if a large sale comes through, hedge that deal by selling right after you receive it before the price moves too much (although it works both ways).  Bitcoin is volatile, hence why merchant accounts are attractive, but you can get by without one. 
If volume gets high and you're spending too much time trading, perhaps someone could code an app for you using bitstamps's trading API?  
But you could accept bitcoin without the need to exchange if your supplier accepts it.  Bikhuk accepts it, probably herbal salvation too but I'm not sure. 
Good luck, hope the business works out!

It has to do with optics.  Yes kratom is amazing, and legal, but bitcoin companies constantly run the risk of losing their bank accounts, so they adopt draconian compliance policies to help mitigate anything banks might perceive as a "high-risk" business. 
Hopefully things change, but until then, kratom stores should just accept bitcoin manually without fiat conversion tools.  Or, somebody out there should write an application overtop an exchange's API that high risk businesses can use.

USD is debt - based money.  It's printed into existence on a whim by central bankers and lent to your government at interest.  You pay federal income tax solely to pay this interest.  Cash isn't electronic but it still represents debt, just in paper form.

What do you expect? Mass adoption immediately? Like..give it a few years man.  You sound like the "lol what a joke, I can't use Bitcoin at every retailer? Pssh" people.
It's true that there is little practical reason for most people to want to use Bitcoin now.  That's fine, Rome wasn't built in a day.  Smart people around the world are developing solutions to the problems.  One day, Bitcoin will have a lot to offer people in terms of immediate utility.  I'm betting capital will flow in to Bitcoin when that time comes.  
Buying Bitcoin now is still a speculative investment, we are speculating that bitcoin's practical utility will increase year over year.

The blockchain is the answer to the decades-old computer science of the Byzantine General's Problem: How can a network of computers arrive at consensus on a set of data with constantly changing values, in the presence of malicious actors, without the need for a central authority?
Bitcoin is the first computer protocol to do this, probably because the decentralization and democratization of money transfer, creation and issuance is where the its needed most right now. 
But Bitcoin can revolutionize so many other aspects of the world we live in besides money.  Law, Commerce, Education, Government...each of these contains hundreds of thousands of unique opportunities.  It's crazy to consider that once this technology is utilized to its fullest potential, we will live in an entirely different world, likely unrecognizable from what it is now.

They will make more money if they share part, not all, of the savings with customers, thereby encouraging more people to pay with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 15:26:14
This is what they'll do.  They will create some ETF and attempt to convince the market that the price of one share of this ETF is the price of one Bitcoin.  However the ETF shares will not be backed 1:1 with actual BTC.  It will be like an IOU that will be leveraged as much as is needed in order to keep the ETF price within an acceptable (to them) range.  And of course ETF investors will have no access to any private keys, and there will be no complete proof of reserves. 
This option would sound absurd to everyone here, but they'll mainly be convincing the uneducated masses of the ETF's value; not us.
This is roughly how they've convinced people that an actual ounce of silver is only worth ~$17.  However, if everyone who owns paper silver were to demand delivery of physical metal (because they thought their SLV investment = actual metal), the price of silver would have to increase to several hundred dollars per ounce if they were to satisfy all deliveries, or they'd have to settle all requests for delivery from contracts in cash.
They'll try to control BTC price the same way that they control the physical metal price; by siphoning as much investor demand for actual Bitcoin into their phony ETF as possible, and manipulating the price of that ETF, and quoting only the ETF price in the media.  If they have their way, the true market price of btc as listed on an actual Bitcoin exchange will be the black market price, never referenced in the media.
I don't think it will work, because Bitcoin provides simply too much utility, when the user actually holds their own private keys.  Plus, Bitcoin storage and key management solutions will soon get a lot easier for the average person, which will decrease the perceived value of entrusting ones private keys to someone else (in this case, the ETF custodian).

The bankers will win, every time.  There is no stopping the eventual destruction of our modern way of life.  Bitcoin gave me hope for a while, but now I realize the price is at least as manipulated as any other market out there is.  They have all the gox coins and they will make sure that the next 10 waves of buyers lose money in order to shape the sentiment they want.  It's funny that most realize that transaction malleabiIlity was a ruse, but so few consider the likelihood that the gox coins are in the hands of people who want bitcoin to fail.
Even if they didn't hold enough coins to crash the price to $5 on a whim, the general public are too fucking hopelessly stupid to wake up to the state of the economy, much less take steps towards fixing it en masse.

Fraud and compliance are why acquiring bitcoin sucks right now.  Because dollars that are not in cash form are reversible, and bitcoin is not, things can't be as easy as we all hope.  If you choose to disregard the risk of chargebacks, your business will be eaten alive by fraudsters.  If you choose to disregard compliance in favor of user experience and generating more business, your business will get shut down by the State and you'll probably go to jail. 
people aren't just blaming the legacy system because it's an easy way to deflect criticism of bitcoin.  This is a reality that all entrepreneurs have to deal with.  Though if you find a way around these two big obstacles while avoiding the consequences, nobody will be able to compete with you, so what are you waiting for?

Well I'm no expert but...right now it seems the only way to keep the price of bitcoin down is through naked shorting.  I understand that happens in gold and silver too, but with metals they've actually been able to go as far as to price physical ounces based on a paper ETF, of which there's at least 100x the supply as there is actual metal out there. 
With bitcoin, the shorting is possible, but there isn't yet a phony ETF that people have been convinced is equivalent to holding and actual bitcoin in a wallet.  Seems this isn't far off though.

Until the Bitcoin price is stabilized, the free market offers up a consumer protection model that works, you can buy almost everything you need or want with Bitcoin without going too far out of your way, and banks have stopped refusing to service Bitcoin companies, it's likely that bitcoin's utility will not exceed that offered by credit cards or debit cards for the majority of people, not including unbanked and heavy remitters (who can benefit in current state, or at least we're close to helping those people).
The way I see it, we simply aren't there yet.  But look at how much innovation has taken place in the crypto space since 2009 relative to the credit card space since 1950, and the difference is massive.  This indicator, combined with an understanding of what the blockchain breakthrough makes possible by enabling trust-less consensus, makes me believe that Bitcoin will be raised out of obscurity within 2 or 3 years.
So ultimately, there will be people that will wait until the Bitcoin network matures to the point that it offers enough true (not imagined) value before actually using it.  These are the "wait and see-ers", and that's totally fine.  Personally, my money is on Bitcoin eventually succeeding, so I choose to hold and use bitcoin in its current clunky state, rather than trying to predict the adoption schedule and risk getting left behind.
Though, I also don't hang out in or all day attempting to convince them of their folly like some of our resident trolls do here :P

If it only inconvenienced the customer, they wouldn't do it.  It actually does a lot.  If someone fraudulently wires money from your bank account to the exchange, the 2 week period allows the victim to notice the transaction and call the exchange to report fraud. 
It's an inconvenience for everyone, but when 1 fraudulent transfer can gravely harm the exchange, and in turn the entire Canadian bitcoin economy, I think it's worth it.  Exchanges deal with fraud attempts by very savvy fraudsters daily.  Because bitcoin is irreversible, fraud is a big deal.

Then watch them siphon 97% of the demand for actual bitcoins into (at least initially), A bitcoin-backed ETF.  Once the banks ensure that everyone thinks that the ETF is as good as Bitcoin, they'll be able to mess with the contracts to set the price at whatever they want.  Banks may then start to offer these EFTs to customers directly as a way to "invest in Bitcoin/"block chain tech"/cryptocurrency" "without the risk" of holding the keys.
It'll be as bad as having GLD/SLV while thinking you have actual physical metal.  Imagine what PMs would cost right now if the entire market cap of paper ETFs had instead been invested into actual gold or silver metal.  
This is how banks deal with investment vehicles that naturally expose the economic reality of their debt/fiat money system...it's only a matter of time before Bitcoin is co-opted in this way.
However, actual bitcoins you that you can move on your own will be traded at a crazy premium above the ETF spot price.  But nothing what it would be like without millions of fools buying an ETF.

I think that competition in this area will increase bitcoin's utility, keep (drug) prices low, reduce gang violence, increase the safety of each "illicit" transaction (compared to the traditional method), raise the price of btc, and help reinforce bitcoin's status as a safe haven.
Sure it's low hanging fruit for the media to smear btc, however if its not drugs, it will be some other angle that they push to try to shape public opinion on bitcoin.  I have confidence that enough people will connect the dots regarding what bitcoin is all about when they see that it's anonymous enough to make services like this possible.
Also, I think it would be more of an issue if there were more public support for the drug war as well as the corporate media, but support in both areas is reaching all time lows.

I think he was more wondering how the homeless cash out, when most are likely to not have bank accounts or ID for verification purpose at the exchanges.  I guess the answer if for more merchants to accept bitcoin so as to eliminate the need to cash out.

But once you have bitcoins, it's easy to regain and retain the pseudonymity you were hoping for. There are tumbling services, blockchain.info shared send, and other crypto currencies that you easily get in and out of fast, and without verification.  Going off-chain and back on with a new wallet is a great way to get fresh new coins and disassociate yourself from your old coins and wallet address. 
 Although I would like to see in person transactions become the norm...localbitcoins.com is currently the best option but I think some competition for them would be healthy for bitcoin.  The online exchanges can relatively easily be throttled but you can't stop in person transactions.

I think you might be right.  Why the downvotes?  Mention of KYC and AML in a non-derogatory context?
I don't like it either, but I wish that the downvoters would go ahead and start their own exchanges, and then remain defiant in the face of getting your bank account shut down or business license revoked for non-compliance.  
I'm not in favour of regulation of BTC, but I'm in favour of our few exchanges doing what's necessary to stay in business long enough to get coin in enough people's wallets.  
It's very important that we decentralize BTC exchange in the very near future though.  I think we need a better alternative to localbitcoins.com more than we need more alternative online exchanges.

I'm a little confused on how this can be considered a game changer for bitcoin.  These institutional investors aren't buying bitcoin OR using bitcoin.  Unless I'm missing something, buying into a security like this doesn't constitute bitcoin adoption.  Seems those buying into this fund will benefit from increased adoption without actually contributing to the adoption efforts themselves.  
Please somebody tell me why I'm retarded for thinking this. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 11:14:36
Until truly decentralized exchanges are possible, this really is the best option for bitcoin I think.  Playing ball with regulatory agencies is the only way for exchanges to stay in business long enough for the geniuses and entrepreneurs among us sort out alternative solutions to the current centralized btc/fiat interface. 
We shouldn't view the exchanges' trend towards AML and KYC compliance as a hinderance to BTC.  It's a necessary evil to maintain a reasonable rate of adoption while the btc economy grows.  The fiat/btc interface will look very, very different in a year or two from now.

India's central bank is unlikely to look at bitcoin differently than any other central bank.  A central bank is a central bank.  They control interest rates and the money supply.  They indenture their host nation in unpayable debt, and only answer to the bank of international settlements in Switzerland.   Even if a some nation's central bank were to go rogue and "look the other way", political pressure would mount and the country would risk getting liberated and taught democracy.

The American health care system can very quickly turn someone into a slave.  I gotta say that if I got hit by a car and had to go to the hospital, and ended up with a 50k bill, I'd flee the country or try to hide my assets.  The average guy can't recover from a hit like that with an average wage and rampant inflation.  It's a financial death sentence.  
Now, I wouldn't run from a 10k hospital bill.  OP aside, I think there comes a point where one can be justified in not paying.  If the hospital were a corporation, we'd say it was a scam.  Can't the price of emergency medical care be a complete and total scam?

Just read it all.  I feel a bit sick right now.  The idea that bitcoin would be introduced as a great libertarian solution, but would soon be co-opted and morphed into the draconian, NWO currency we all knew was coming, was always in the back of my mind.  I chose to ignore it.  
The world's rulers are unfathomably cunning people.  Surely they wouldn't introduce their one-world currency to the world without a believable disguise.  
I can totally see central banks buying up bitcoin in mass quantities, driving the price to exorbitant levels, spurring a media frenzy, prompting tens of millions to sell their terminally ill dollar-backed wealth for bitcoin.  Maybe this is the inevitable dollar crash I've been expecting for so long.  Now, with bitcoin, the dollar has something to crash relative to.  Market manipulation ensures it won't crash against precious metals, and central bank collusion ensures all currencies are devalued in tandem to one another.  Bitcoin however, seems uniquely capable of draining wealth from the old paradigm, into the new paradigm, under the guise of freedom.  
I'm not convinced yet, but I expect to have my mind made up within the next couple months as events unfold.  Obviously nothing good can come from these senate hearings.  The writing is on the wall that bitcoin will not be adequately represented.  
I'm going for a long walk.  Hopefully when I come back someone will have explained to me why I'm delusional.

Right I get that, but how is buying into a fund that simply mirrors the price of bitcoin adding actual liquidity to the bitcoin market?  Put another way, how does $10 million of investor money pegged to the price of bitcoin via this fund translate into actual liquidity on an order book?  If I want to buy $10 million of bitcoin, don't I still need to make due with the liquidity provided by the exchanges?  It's not like I can purchase bitcoins the from investors that bought into this fund, because they don't have actual coins to sell me...because they're just along for the ride.  So how are they adding liquidity?  Thanks to whoever can set me straight here..

I think the opposite is true for most of what you said.  The regulations are written poorly and broadly enough to enable abuse by the bank, such as in this scenario. 
And banks not being able to afford standing up against government? Again, other way around.  Libor? HSBC drug money laundering? Zero prosecutions following the 2008 mortgage / derivative crisis?  Banks don't fear government, not one bit.  They pretend they do so they can deflect blame when they wield their power.  They are the money launderers, the market riggers, and the ones vetting and then bribing the politicians.  These AML laws being cited only serve to protect the Big Money monopoly, not to "protect the community from criminals" as is often implied. 
The laws are written by the banks for the banks in large part.  I cannot see how you can come to their defence here.  The bank is not "playing it safe", at least not in the context you present.  They are playing it safe by attempting to crush something they don't control.

Gold and silver have been pretty popular topics of conversation for thousands of years now.

Better yet, a credit union.

Same here.  Exciting, isn't it?

Yep, they'll get cash shut down at every bank just like Virtex did.

I agree with what you said, but I disagree with how you said it.

Hilarious, a refreshing break from those corny and condescending banking commercials.

Is there a marketplace subreddit that can use to buy &amp; sell used things to redditors using the tipbot?

He said subscribe, not follow.  Really, I'm curious who you believe is offering better information than max?

A Washington insider perhaps?

Lol what is the origin of this type of meme?  I love it
Edit: what the hell?  What'd I say?

Any plans to support $CAD?

If that's your position, then I'm curious why you specifically mention cold storage in your above reply?  Would a blockchain.info wallet not count as money then too?
I am on the fence on this.  I suppose because BTC is still (in my mind) a grand experiment, profits aren't realized till you cash out or buy something.  Until then, you're just "up".
Once BTC establishes itself further and is no longer considered a speculative investment, I would agree with you.
