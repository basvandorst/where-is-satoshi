The answer is yes, but not after the bitcoin rewards for mining dwindle to the point that they have to start skyrocketing the transaction fees.

The other guy gave the official answer. The real answer is that it is an IOU for the actual currency, the actual thing of value: a value entry on their ledger system. Cash is nothing more than exactly that. It's a bank note, a reciept, redeemable for an entry in their ledger system.

And it could also be a painful reminder for us that their power is increasingly unlimited.

Oh yeah. I forgot that cash as currency has a negligible effect on the clarity of value, ease of interchange, and overall convenience in a physical transaction between individuals and groups. My bad; you're right. It wouldn't make things harder at all.

Well at least you can admit when you're wrong. Dead wrong. 
That'll make the switch over to Etherium easier. :D

Cash was originally your paper receipt for a transaction at your bank regarding your gold.

If they get rid of cash, that will make it even harder to buy bitcoin.

Why is it that people seem to ignore the very real impending reality coming up in the next few yars that transaction fees will need to skyrocket in order for bitcoin to continue?

Ethereum ftw.

*literally no one?*
Ill have you know that I personally an convinced that it will *never* change from 1 mb.

But it will, when the reward for mining gets so low that transaction fees become the only reward, making transaction fees skyrocket. Anything Bitcoin can do, Etherium will do better, with a more useful blockchain.

It's too bad that it's an official propaganda wing of the Russian government. :(

But... I just read that on the internet.

From my favorite journalist who resigned from there citing that as her reason.
