tl;dr: It might go up, or it might go down.

The story is a little longer. This tax existed quite a while ago but in a Provincial level. Each "province" (actually called Autonomous Community) could set this tax in the past and the central government, to foment homogeneous taxing and pretty much to mess with one of them, Catalonya, imposed it at Country level but with a 0% tax level. Now they changed it (country level again) to 0,03%.

An exported wallet will do. Advise your users against that kind of transactions.

Luke-jr is "nuts", is "a catholic fanatic", is "an extremist"... well, in my book is the one paying more attention to the lower layer of the community, answering everything that he´s asked, resilient to reddit flame, provided a soft fork solution to seg-wit and on top of that this amazing "lets make these discussions really public" extra effort.
Keep it up mate. We Joe Nobodys really appreciate it.

Great Work Core dev team. Keep it up, we all thank your work and commitment.
EDIT: interesting. Got automatically downvote 1 sec after I posted...

They are taking the right steps lately. Keep it up Core!

Start with a few dollars, not hundreds. Play with them, move them around, try to recover your wallet as if you had lost it.... when you are familar and confortable with it THEN buy a considerable amount.
Of course, if "a few hundred dollars" is a very small amount for you, then you can play with them ;)

Miners approve of a BIP which renders them the sole decidors of block size, ergo of fees? wow, surprising.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:13:37
I am very interested to know what do you think about BIP100, luke. Do you think there is room for consensus for this BIP?

What about fundraising a technical meetup/workshop for them to discuss and maybe if enough funds reached, take some off time:  ?
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:40:04
Can you elaborate on this? What kind of process do you imagine could unfold once the CR is approved?

And that drop is the one that generated the HODL term. Good old times

Just one question following your first reply: how will you know/measure this agreement has enough user consensus, so you can get involved into finding that "not-completely-absurd" solution for the 2MB HF?
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:59:54
Very nice initiative!! Hi there

I don´t think I follow what you mean with your last phrase. Could you please elaborate?
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:54:29
Use your memory. Stored the seeds somewhere? did you ever install it someplace else? What passwords did you use back then? are they usually mnemonics? could they be the same as those u used in other webpages/services? If so, check your mail for "registration" and try to remember/recover passwords from sites u used back then...
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:08:14
ah ok. I guess you mean they say they will honor this agreement so that BIP148 is no successful and then backoff.

@_date: 2017-06-18 13:56:53
the 0,3% was just following upstairs post, but I get your point, though one would think the explicit support for BIP148 would be higher than it is now. In any case, if you will humor me with another answer, what is your stance on Segwit2x potential? is there a chance for it to be a good option over BIP148 code and support-wise?
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:26:06
Problem is bitmain can (and seems it will) mine with a higher hashrate on BIP148 privately, and release bunchs of blocks that will orphan those previously mined with that 0,3% hashrate, and with 0 transactions in them. This will accomplish 2 goals: 
- Bankrupt that 0,3 hashrate by not giving any reward to them in the BIP148 chain
- Disrupt and make unreliable any transaction in the BIP148 chain.
And this is "cheap" for bitmain. Only counteraction I know against this is change of PoW or changing rules of number of needed transactions in the chain (which can be easily mitigated by Bitmain simply inserting its own phoney transactions) or mine privately on the BIP148 chain and release it altogether when segwit is already activated, so cannot be attacked (which goes against ethos of pretty much everyone except bitmain). Can any real expert (tell me if I am wrong?
