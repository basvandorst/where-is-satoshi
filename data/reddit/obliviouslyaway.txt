to give credit where credit is due, the bitcoin fanboys are assuming an environment where fincen regulations don't apply.  in which case, allowing purchase in btc and returns in usd would be fine.  but then you have money laundering.

this is great.  well if they return it, may as well return their money for USD.  keep the bitcoin for us.  just another way for the rich to get richer, i suppose.

Why are you looking locally?
Everyone is like bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin because no fees, instant transactions etc.  but then "oh I can't open a credit union because blah. One day bitcoin will resolve this problem" except [you can fix this right now with minimal search technique](
Not to mention a lot of credit union refund atm fees (kinda like 0% transaction fees for butcoin), so it doesn't even matter if your branch is local.  Plus you can deposit checks via website or phone app (kinda like a qr code for bitcoin)

@_date: 2014-01-27 20:25:19
this only affects dollars.  nothing is stopping you from mining one of the many altcoins and converting that to bitcoin.  if you stop being a bitch, you'll see that the control revolves around the USD.  the second USD comes into play, AML laws get triggered.
just like when you kill someone with your car, laws come into play to determine if you should be tried for homicide or manslaughter.  don't like it, don't hit someone with your car.  
don't  like the laws?  start convincing others to understand your mindset (i.e. not calling the government, or by proxy your peers, thugs).  feel as though you're the only one that thinks this way in this country?  then leave, no one is keeping you here.  you can always move to europe (likely to have similar rules), russia (also likely), or somalia (not likely, but also limited connections to other first world countries).

i'll take this one.  we seem to all have trouble remembering what was said in the previous thread so I shall recap:


according to this post for bitcoin wants to be successful, amazon needs to jump on board.  amazon is already successful, so why would they accept bitcoin?


ergo their hesitation to accept other payment processors.  why should they take on a liability when they already accept all major credit cards which handle the liability for them?


so it's good for amazon to take on the liability of bitcoin so more people are comfortable with shopping with bitcoin.  even though they accept all major credit cards.  [how does bitcoin specifically help amazon?](


amazon should accept bitcoin because [then more people will shop at amazon]( until bitcoin becomes mainstream and then people will stop shopping at amazon with bitcoin and go elsewhere.  how does amazon benefit from that long-term strategy?


So if I understand this correctly, Amazon would benefit from bitcoin if the positive (high sales volume) outweighted the negative (added liability of accepting bitcoins e.g. lawsuits as originally stated).  However this isn't possible unless Amazon accepts bitcoin, which they do not.  Thus, until Amazon has a financially sound reason to accept bitcoin, bitcoin will not take that big step.  So maybe the point of is making is that Amazon is not going to take some giant faithless leap into accepting bitcoin until it is well- established.


I apologize if I am wrong and my reading comprehension is not up to snuff, but it also sounds like everyone in this entire thread needs to work on their writing comprehension.  Maybe use a few bitcoin to go back to grammar school so they may learn to make cohesive arguments.

so why go with BTC in the first place?  why not go with a gift card loaded with USD value?  to the retailer its the same thing.  they work with usd, and you can convert whatever denomination you want into that gift card.  you can't convert rupees into a target gift card, you need to convert to a currency the retailer accepts first.  why must btc be any different?  why should btc have priority over any other currency, crypto or not?
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:54:14


just being pedantic here, you are correct except with your amounts.  if you deal with more than $1000 per person per day, you are an exchange.  if someone buys one or more products totalling $999 in BTC, and you refund that in USD, you are not exchange. however if someone pays $500 in  BTC one day, $600 in BTC another day, and asks for a refund of $1100 USD, you are now an exchange in fincen's eyes.  still not a valid solution, because $1000 fridges.
btc is not meant for retail.  that's the bottom line.

@_date: 2014-01-07 19:36:16


you don't understand financial regulation either.  the answer is yes, it does make them an exchanger if they deal with purchases &gt;$1000 per customer per day.  which means that $1000 fridge makes them liable.  that said, they could outsource that task to a payment processer like bitpay, but then the store is only dealing in usd and not btc (bitpay keeps the btc and pays the store in usd)
TL;DR: fincen has effectively regulated bitcoin (and zynga dollars, and airline miles, and store points, etc) and it is those regulations which much change first

@_date: 2014-01-10 16:23:53
banks are required to give you the entire terms of the loan.  but i'm betting people who gamble don't read or don't believe the published odds just as the people taking bad loans didn't read the terms of their ARM loans.
secondly, just who exactly is forcing anyone to take a mortgage?  the home owners taking the loan need to walk into a bank just as the gamblers need to walk into a casino.  is it because of the advertisements? "buy a home now!" vs "come to navijo casino and win today!"?  you should really consider the other side of your argument before you make it, fyi
so maybe you're right.  maybe gamblers are not ill informed.  maybe they are smarter than homeowners.  down with banks, up with bitcoin!!

that's like saying "i have stocks, you should accept my stock position for this microwave.  you don't? it's up 115% this MONTH!! why aren't you seeing the future of doing away with dollars and moving back to bartering?"
you see how that doesn't make sense?  you have many ways to convert the btc back to usd and then use that usd anywhere.  as for credit card fees, large retailers pay razor thin fees.  you may get charged 2.8%, but macys, target, etc are paying somewhere around .5% because they make up for it in volume.  then there's the fact that you can withdraw your usd into cash *instantly* to pay the retailer.  0% transaction fees.  bitcoin won't touch that.  
next, pci compliance is for credit cards.  all this would do is create additional privacy laws stating your personal information must be protected like pci.  so you're back to the same position with a credit card again (edit: this already occurs when retailers take your drivers license for return information, so you still need a form of privacy security compliance).  
chargebacks.  when someone steals 1000BTC, its not the retailers fault right.. they're still getting money.  now you are allowing criminals easy ways to spend their ill-gotten funds.  or what if you purchase an item and it's not as it's described?  you have removed customer confidence to strengthen your bottom line.  
none of this sounds bright for bitcoin's future... maybe further workarounds will be created, but the ghash.io/51% attack idea is still fresh in everyone's minds

if you can't spend them at walmart, then how are we free from the tyranny of the state when the tyrannous state  controls the money circulation?  
cash provides anonymity and decentralization.  it is also stable since it is backed by the us government.  how does bitcoin fix this problem compared to an anonymous visa gift card?  visa has regulations which it must adhere to and thus super wally world can use it.  now joe blow, who can't afford credit, has a visa card which they can use from their home.  bitcoin could do the same thing, except it provides *too much* anonymity.  money laundering is bad, and since that sales clerk at walmart can be criminally prosecuted for money laundering, walmart doesn't allow it.  so now joe blow has no use for bitcoins and just sees it as another bankers playtoy that will eventually ruin the economy and they won't see a dime of that money
bitcoin is a concept, no different than bestbuy reward points, airline miles, or xbox points.  it's just, like linux, an open standard which anyone can implement.  the thing about bitcoin which makes it stand out differently is that it has widespread adoption *in a mostly underground market*.  seriously, who are the users of bitcoins.  darknet users, investors, and miners.  your parents don't own bitcoins, your sister won't know what to do with it.  until someone like walmart accepts bitcoins, it is just like linux vs freebsd vs beos in the 90s.  all the big players will stand on the sideline while the lawsuits are fought and the winner emerges.
bitcoin can easily fuck da police, but not everyone is willing to say fuck da police until there are risks for entry are lowered

you're doing this wrong buddy.  first, fix your credit.  second, get a bank account that refunds atm fees.  third, use a credit card.  fourth, keep your cash in an investment account that makes more than 2%/year.  fifth, pay credit card with funds from investment account.  
this is not rocket science, it's simple math and shopping around.  currently i would use bitcoin in steps 3 and 4 when i can, but supplement the rest of my purchases with fiat currency.  of course i would not put all my eggs in bitcoin because, well, [the GZA says it best](

@_date: 2013-12-04 17:59:14


Okay, let's look at your comments then


You do not have a bank account that refunds ATM fees.  So, my second point is correct,else you wouldn't have a reason to complain about said ATM fees.  You can get an account that refunds ATM fees from TD Ameritrade with no deposit requirements.  You need decent credit to open an account with them.  So either my first point is correct or you didn't know about Ameritrade.


Continuing with Ameritrade's features, you can transfer funds into a different vehicles.  By doing so, and with the market performing so well thanks to the QE bubble, you can leave your cash in one of the many comission-free ETFs they have which have been earning &gt;7%.  Thus making my fourth point correct.


I ignored the patently false 4% hidden costs statement.  But 2.5% in fees?  The above 7% gaining ETF is paying for those 2.5% of fees.  Fifth correct statement.
So unless I read something completely incorrect here, I don't think I made a lot of assumptions and nothing I said was mistaken.  But please, feel free to correct me.  I wasn't telling you that you are unhappy with your current state, I was pointing out ways to make yourself happier instead of going on a tirade of how cash and credit costs you money.

c) this probably happened at comcast.  all of their email is plaintext and they do not have audit controls in place on their mail servers.  all you would need to do is mount the nas to a local system and do a "find | grep" for bitcoin wallets.  i no longer work there, but now i wish i was never fired :)

without regulation, no one knows what's legal or not.  the us government is notorious for retroactively punishing companies (see bank of america/countrywide).  so now you have major retailers who wish to jump on the BTC bandwagon who cannot because they may be wasting money on something the government decides is no longer a legal service.
regulation will help BTC.. however if you don't believe it will, then allow me to point out when regulations did not exist: 1950 ma bell (you had to purchase a phone from the phone company and it was never yours). 2008 subprime market crash (you get a loan, you get a loan, EVERYBODY GETS A LOAN), the budding war on net neutrality, etc
