Except that one thing can be guaranteed, 100% of the community will never agree on anything.  There would definitely be some who don't switch to the bitcoinxt code base

How would bitcoin have prevented this?  In the future where you can receive your legitimate US paycheck in bitcoin, don't you think the IRS is going to demand that the same deductions be taken out of said paychecks in bitcoins? 
In which case the IRS would have the private keys to 'your' bitcoins being withheld for tax purposes.
This same story would have occurred, except with fancy technical terms like 'cold wallets' and 'blockchain' being thrown in.

As a strict definition, no, but I think this is best answer.
Currencies that are "backed" by something have value because the thing that backs them has value.  Something backed by gold only has value because gold is rare and more can't be created on a whim.
Bitcoins, while they can't be 'traded' for math, in fact have their scarcity backed by math.  People value bitcoins because they believe that the underlying mathematics will prevent any one person from "printing" an unlimited amount of them and eliminating it's value.

It's been pretty well discussed on both forums, the difficulty adjustment isn't really in dispute, the only questions are:
1- How many miners move back and forth, and
2- How much the coins' market values will be impacted by the resulting hash rate changes and therefore transaction fees/times.

Technically you are then selling it.  
I think that was OP's point, though admittedly a pedantic one... "never exchange for fiat" is probably what everyone normally thinks when they say "never sell".

It is indicative of the protocol as a whole.  It's not an indictment, it's just a fact of how the blockchain works.
As soon as you can associate a name with an address, all historical transactions made by that person using that address are now easily retrievable.

Also a pain at toll booths.  Use caution in traffic circle / roundabouts because people will be looking at the wrong seat for cues and get confused.

I think this debate stopped being about the actual block size a long time ago.  At this point, this is about *who* gets to decide anything about bitcoin.

Forget the whole forking drama, this was the best programmer insult I've heard in a while...

Did not see that coming.  Hilarious.

That's why I put it in quotes.  But having control of the repository is the closest thing to ownership in the open source sense.
To your second point, I agree.  I believe the miners are betting that people will use it or buy it.  And if 95% of hash rate actually moves, they may be right, and that $36M bet will be worth it.  And these kind of bets are not that uncommon, reference the $200M Fox paid for US World Cup coverage that now has no US presence.  Oops.
So to me, this is one of two questions I'm dying to know the answer to...  is how much are miners willing to lose to gain control of the core software used on the dominant chain?  $36M seems plausible to me, but who knows the real answer.  Then question  is the flip side, if hash rate moves, how much transaction delay/fees are users willing to put up with to keep the current core (and for how long)?

People willing to spend $36 million to "own" the software that runs the world's next currency.

I think it's because some of the older devices don't have the same hardware module... new enough to get iOS 8 but old enough to use a different architecture.
