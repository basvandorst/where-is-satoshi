I would be more impressed if all these bitcoins were purchased by Don Draper...

If I had a billion bananas and everyone started eating apples, I'd probably tell people not to apples too.

I don't think they really need a thank you letter. I think the bajillion dollars they're making off their investment is probably enough for them. :)

Is this in addition to the other two (that I know of) drops that occurred earlier?

It could be a scam, but at the same time it seems like they're just thinking of clever ways to get bitcoins through sales. $350 worth of bitcoins could be worth $500 in a very short period of time. They're probably banking on an increase, hence the good deal, which is a loss in the short term for them, but a large gain in the long term.

I purchased a Jalepeno 4.5 GH/s machine back in April for roughly ~$165 ( I don't remember exactly how much, because I paid in bitcoins ).  It's now October and I have yet to see my machine and as far as I know, they're only at the end of February.  
I'm glad I didn't spring for the "express shipping"...What a joke!

It's not any hard to say than Dollar bill or something like that. I think in the long run there will probably be slang terms created for it much in the same way you have with any other currency.

I will definitely look into it. Thank you for the help :) Much appreciated.

Just got my card code. I guess I wasn't clear about where to get the code. Thanks for your help :)

The bitcoin costs doesn't seem to coincide with any actually cost. 
* 2008 VW R32 80BTC (~$60k). Brand new they sell for ~$40k at most. 
* Lancer Evolution 100BTC (~$75k). Brand new they sell for ~$45k at most.
* Subaru STi 100BTC (~$75k). Brand new they sell for ~$35k at most. 
Why are all your prices so high?

I've been doing this whole bitcoin "thing" for about a year now. I started on my PC until I was able to buy a dedicated computer for mining.  I used bitcoins to buy that computer and I haven't spent any actual money investing in it.  
Maybe I'm just cynical, but using physical currency which I spent actual time earning to buy theoretical meta-currency which fluctuates in a ridiculous manner seems extremely lacking in consideration of the future.
In the mean time, I have been rolling the bitcoins into Amazon gift cards which I used to fuel my video game habit.  My PS4 is already paid for.

Can't you just have someone else you trust buy them for you?

Making technology unavailable in order to enforce a ban on bitcoins is like using a chainsaw to cut your toast.

Implying that not buying a companies products is an ineffective way to let a company know that there are people who who are displeased with their actions...right. 
I would also point out that OP is an Apple fanboy. It's quite evident by his previous posts.

I bought it about an hour and a half ago. I have received the confirmation email. I sent the correct amount, but have yet to receive the card yet. idk

At what age is currency appropriate?
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:14:54
Any suggestions? Right now I'm using Slush's Pool.

I've had arguments with people about bitcoin, and when they tell me all about how bitcoin is bad, I can't help but realize that their arguments can be used against most fiat currencies as well.

Bitcoins a possibility...reasonable delivery times,not so much
