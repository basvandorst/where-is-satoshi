I suggest you go read their documentation a bit more. Specifically [this]( part. It is different for Credit Cards vs Bitcoins.
All 'Checkout' does is provide you with a front end to use to collect payment information and turn that data into a 'token'. 
With credit cards, it provides you with a card token. If you choose to let 'Checkout' both **authorize and capture** a charge then there isn't really much you need to do on the backend to get your money, if you only authorized a charge then at some point in the future your backend needs to capture the funds by using the card token that Stripe returned through 'Checkout'.
With Bitcoins, once the customer completes the 'Checkout' form you are given a BTC receiver token that must then be redeemed through Stripe's API in order to retrieve the payment. Once you have a receiver token in hand you are assured that the funds are available to Stripe and by redeeming the token Stripe will transfer the funds into your Stripe account. With Stripe Checkout and Bitcoins you absolutely have to redeem the 'recevier token' with their API in order to get your funds.

Attitudes like this are funny. Do you hate the fact that all financial institutions must do things like this to stay compliant with the laws or just the fact that it is happening when using something like Bitcoin?
People commit financial crimes using cash and various commodities all the time that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. In fact, I would argue that Bitcoin allows the financial institution to have a much better picture of the flow of funds through their accounts compared to a cash ledger and thus should have a much easier time complying with the laws and regulations.

Please point out where BitPay is saying this? 
Also by your definition, any improvement to the protocol by *anyone* should be considered 'not allowed to say'.
There is no reasonable way to improve Bitcoin with the current political climate and it's total bullshit. The only one true consensus for Bitcoin is what the majority of people that are actually participating in the network(ie. running nodes) agree upon, but if I'm not allowed to talk about or show code that improves the Bitcoin protocol then you can simply see that whatever is the current consensus will continue to be the future consensus.
However, that is not the case because there is one special group of people that believe that their vision for the Bitcoin protocol is the holy-grail and savior of the protocol and we are only permitted to talk about code they write, that is utterly insane.

Yes I did, I think you misunderstand what consensus means. If a small group of developers say something must be, that is not consensus. If the Bitcoin network runs software that says something must be, that is consensus.
It's quite simple. So in order to promote improvement of Bitcoin you must allow all discussion and promotion of code that might change how the Bitcoin protocol runs.

I think you are misleading people as to what SegWit offers "today". It does not offer a capacity increase "today" and will not even offer an increase the moment it becomes activated. To fully realize the capacity increases that SegWit brings everyone single transaction needs to use SegWit.
There is a far simpler solution in just increasing the blocksize to providing scaling to Bitcoin that should have been implemented well over a year ago while SegWit was worked on, tested and released. 
There is not a single coherent argument as to *why* SegWit is **better** then a blocksize increase at increasing capacity. The two are not mutually exclusive, but SegWith comes with a significant amount of technical debt and risk and will never provide the same capacity increase as simply doubling the blocksize. 
So to argue that SegWit provides a capacity increase "today" is highly misleading.

A 2MB blocksize is not any more susceptible to DOS attacks than a 1MB blocksize is. An ~1MB transaction already causes nodes trouble and could potentially cause a 'DOS' attack, making them 2MB all of the sudden does not 'instantly open the system', it is already 'open'.

If the author is really trying to make a parallel to the layers of networking then he's forgetting the obvious point that size of a block is equivalent to the throughput of layer 1. 
Why on earth would anyone who wants to participate at the layer 2 level want to limit the throughput of layer 1 besides creating an artificial supply limit for monetary gain?  It's the same shit ISPs do when they won't upgrade peering connections and attempt to extort end users to pay for 'faster' connections.

Ok, so you run this PsuedoNode and use the Classic user agent string. Big deal, you still need a remote peer to do blockchain verification for you, so this is an SPV node that allows for configurable user agent strings. 
For the same amount of 'fake' nodes that someone might spin up using one user agent string someone else might spin up ones using a different user agent string.
This is not a problem for classic to handle, this is a problem for all code bases to handle. 
Saying that the numbers of nodes for Classic is wrong because this code exists also means that number of nodes for Core and XT and Unlimited are also wrong. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:45:55
All of that is fine except that it ignores the fact that the 1MB limit was set arbitrarily during a time where it had no effect on the market.
There is no reason why a bigger block size can't be chosen and work just the same way as it is now, just with a larger capacity.
KISS, keep it simple, stupid. 
LN *might* be great, and I say might because as far as I can tell it's still vaporware.
Increasing the blocksize like it's routine as the capacity/throughput of the network increases is a brain-dead simple solution that doesn't require a white paper and thousands of man-hours to research and implement.

You are completely forgetting that the capacity of our technology will also increase over time. Trying to argue that in the future we won't have enough computing capacity to run 8GB blocks is a straight up lie because you can not predict the future.
There is no logical response to wanting to keep the blocksize limited other than as a way to artificially limit capacity(which serves no purpose but to those that stand to gain from it). 
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:03:33
Well maybe the authors of Core should write software the users actually want?
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:09:03
I'm not sure what you mean by the nodes being 'faked'. If you mean the node lying about itself over the network layer well that's a problem that all nodes face, regardless of the codebase, but I'm not really sure that's possible. Nor am I really sure why someone would want to do that anyways. 
There is no 'number' or 'count' field in the network protocols handshake messages, so one network connection is equal to one node. If you can connect to the node then it most certainly is real.
So I really don't understand what you mean by someone can just make 'one instance look like 10'.

How does a hard fork accomplish centralizing the network and what about that makes it easier to regulate? In much the same way the Classic developers have made their own client, anybody else is free to make their own client after a hard fork. There's not anything that says that only Classic developers can write code after a hard fork.

I'm not hoping or praying for anything. I'm specifically telling you that claiming we won't be able to do a certain thing because the technology won't advance fast enough is total bullshit. You have no proof that the technology won't exist so that we could run 64TB sized blocks in 2 years, just like I have no proof that it will exist. 
Claiming that technology won't grow to match the demand is disingenuous at best and a straight up lie at worst. 
Also, who cares about the miners not being to make any money because the block rewards are halving, they will adjust just like they do now when the difficulty goes up or down. 
Regarding a fee market, 1MB is practically the same as 2MB in block size. A fee market will develop with 2MB just like it would with 1MB blocks, or 512KB blocks, or 10GB blocks. If there is a need to put a fee on a TX to get it confirmed then people will do that, regardless of the blocksize.

To an outside observer, there is no way to know if the connections from my tool to the random HTTP servers are malicious in intent.

The beauty of open source is that Gavin is free to do whatever he wants the source code of Bitcoin, provided he follows the rather permissive licensing. Whether or not he can get a supermajority to use his software... well, that's pure speculation and until the point Gavin says that he is giving up and walking away from Bitcoin there is always the possibility that he gets a supermajority of users to use his client. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING. Competition drives innovation.

'Everyone' includes the entire set of the human population. I don't think it will be technically feasible in our lifetime to have that set of people be able to run a full node in their own personal space. That said, there is an obvious desire to make it possible for the widest range of people(within reason) to be able to run their own node: having more peers on a peer-to-peer network increases the robustness and security of the network.
I don't think that the Bitcoin protocol needs to be hindered by a small blocksize solely for the purpose of protecting the desire to let anyone and everyone run a full node, that's not reasonable like I said above. I like to compare the size of the blocks to the capacity of network links. What do you do when you start saturating the capacity? You add more! What do you do when you don't have the technology to add more? You research it!
The problem with Bitcoin is that the research into new capacity is being done while we have existing solutions that are being ignored.

Given that I'm running server grade hardware on a UPS I would consider this machine compromised if it reboots w/o a direct issue from me and would make sure to not key in the passphrases.

Well their websocket datastreams seem to be operational still.
