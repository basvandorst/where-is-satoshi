How do you define a speculation bubble?

Thanks for asking the hard questions. It looks like the worst problem ATM is the limit in how many transactions can be processed.

 I've got a car you can have for a pound of gold

On my cell phone, because I want to use it for shit

Yeah I've only been here a week and I'm itchingfor some volatility
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:24:35
No arguing that
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:19:29
Thanks for the warning I'll prepare for the dip

I'm trying to. It takes gd forever for my bank to clear the ach xsfer to gemini. I intend to buy dinner with btc as soon as gemini gives me my btc. It's been 4 days.

It's been spotty this morning. I was recently able to log in though after seeing down for maintenance page.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:13:01
Well that's something I didn't know was possible. I obviously have a ton to learn about bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:03:48
 And I thought I was clever for mowing lawns instead of dicking around with my friends. You are very smart
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:52:36
Everything is normal now
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:45:50
Not sure if that's it,  tell me if I did it wrong thanks
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:32:14
I'm wondering if 7000 is a weak as it'll get. Not like I have any more cash to turn into bitcoin anyway though

Well I've really shown my ignorance here. You can get a fraction of apple stock, but it would have to be through a third party service. I thought that you could buy fractions of stocks, but you really can't 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:14:26
I don't think it'll get much lower, I was surprised to see it drop at all
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:16:37
You can trace which wallet it went to, but no one necessarily needs to know who owns which wallet

10% off bitcoins!

I ended up buying a crappy pickup and nice sound system. Definitely not a hodl mentality. Do you have plans for your gainz? Mobile audio equipment is pretty kick ass.

I made two separate bitcoin purchases via ach. I bought 
.01 back on 10/24, and then .06925 on 11/2. The ach for the first, smaller purchase was fully cleared, and i should have moved it to my phone wallet but didn't.  Then,  a week later, I bought the .06925 btc, and they're holding my .01 btc until that separate transaction processes!

So... what's an etf and why should I care?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:41:56
If you figure it out let us know 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:47:15
I always thought a grownup with cash for speculating would be sophisticated enough to understand this. Do ppl nor buy apple stock because of sticker shock? Damn there's a lot of dumbasses out there
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:43:38
So my buy high/panic sell the dip strategy is wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:05:50
 thanks for letting me know. I've been wanting to spend, and it's really frustrating. They should have warned me about that. Is this info available on their website?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:42:50

The login page just timed out on me, I came here to see if others are having problems
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:04:43
 That was it? I was hoping for a more dramatic drop.  75 to 70 is only like 7%. I was told there would be volatility?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:07:52
Actually, you're incorrect. Bitcoin is going to get up to about $95k/btc as ppl realize that bitcoin keeps the central bank out of their pickets. Look at Venezuela, Argentine, zimbabwe
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:57:09
Do I understand correctly that the government is telling these institutions they can't buy btc? So the government is only hampering the dollarside of the transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:17:07
Evidence?
