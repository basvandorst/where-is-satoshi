Maybe he invented it and we have a zuckerberg/winklevoss situation.

BitPay? Are they still up and running. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:49:35
Let's not. This is a straight up data mine. They just want your information so they can sell it. $250 is cheap as fuck for a bunch of contact information to sell.

There is nothing unethical about this. Why should a bank pay to operate an account you keep open but put no money in? 
BOA is a shitty bank though.

I sold for a very nice profit at like $13k a few years ago and never bought back. Now I stay in the crypto subs just for the memes.

You can still buy and sell bitcoin on coinbase just not BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:51:43
Why is Gemini any better? I hear nothing but complaints about both. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:11
I was foaming at the mouth to sell my BCH at that $8500 price before I realized it was fake inflated bullshit. I was going to move it straight over to Bitcoin. I still wish I could do it. Fucking coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:49
It's absolutely retarded that I log in to see my Bitcoin Cash finally deposited only to see it inflated by a fake price and dwindle in half and I still can't sell it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:10
Yeah I've been selling off bits to pay tuition, rent, etc and it sucks that it's not still in there but I don't regret taking profit and paying bills.

I am an oncologist and I agree.

In looking at my account Coinbase "gave" me my BCH on the 14th but didn't actually tell me or have it show on my account until yesterday the 19th. And even then I didn't actually receive anything since it wasn't a tangible asset I could buy or sell. Just a locked piece of coin I could watch like a kid at an aquarium.

I actually heard them talking about this on NPR and it was interesting. They went into detail in all the largest North Korean hacking successes and there have been quite a few, more than I realized anyway. The guest on NPR also said that even though the average North Korean has little to no computer or internet access that government has been sending individuals to China for training as hackers. Basically it's their odd buddy buddy relationship with China that is helping them to develop the hackers.

lol. So if ISIS robs a Wells Fargo are you supporting Terrorism by having a checking account? Your logic is flawed and stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:04:22
How did you sell your Bitcoin Cash? Mine is still being held and it says "Bitcoin Cash Sales are temporarily disabled." I want to get that coin out ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:03
I just wish I could sell it while it still has value. Coinbase is still keeping it on lock down. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:30
That's what I'd love to do if Coinbase actually let you sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:14:10
They are $150 on Amazon right now. What did you pay?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:06
Aaaaaand back to under $17k :( 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:30:13
No it does not ban Bitcoin. It's an effort to prevent using Bitcoin to hide income and other fraudulent purposes. This bill is about tax money not banning the currency altogether. Quit the hyperbole. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:27
Yup. lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:18:25
Supposedly. And it's redeemable for less and less BTC every hour as the held hostage BCH plummets. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:33:41
Instead if making up a bullshit title just say you don't want to pay your taxes and this bill will make you pay your taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:31:41
Holy shit. This guy is even dumber than I thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:32
Still can't sell it either. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:44
Maybe by then Coinbase will let me sell it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:13:23
They just opened it. I sold at 4K. It's running a bit since. We'll see what happens with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:15
Coinbase is just fucked. Kind of a bummer I thought I was rich lol. I doubt I'll be able to sell at $8400. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:44:26
They are probably the same person. OP using his alt for upvotes. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:11
lol. No. It's already on the way back up. If you are going to panic every time it drops a little you should probably sell it all now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:34
Pretty much every day there is a chart posted somewhere and a theory on an impending bubble. Nobody really knows for sure though. It's a volitale market. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:51:54
You wrote 4 paragraphs which still said nothing about lighting other than that you want to hype it up. What is it? En-lightning me :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:12
Accurate. In hindsight putting my BCH directly into BTC at 16.4 was a mistake. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:35
I tried extremely hard but never got through. And still can't sell as it continues to plummet. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:27:32
You fell for a scam. Sorry man. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:36:27
Quit posting spam. 
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:48:20
Keep the bitcoin, I'll take the gold. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:51:27
It's like the 3 little bears and their pooridge. You just know when it's right. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:06:23
lol.
