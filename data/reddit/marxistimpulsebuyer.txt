That's a nice theory, considering they also did significant theoretical contributions to onion routing and finances the Tor project for a long while... OTR they usually say it helps their undercover agents and black  ops in embassies keeping in touch with their bosses.

Most likely explanation is that they choose to believe the slides of the mtgox.com -&gt; gox.com plan that are rating high on Hacker News, and then read the comments there where a lot of suspicious stuff about those slides is pointed, and changed the statement.

In my experience very few people hate Bitcoin. Most of those deemed "haters" by the Bitcoin community only hate the community.
I don't blame them, cause I love Bitcoin but would love that most of the self-centered armchair libertarians playing like they got their own gold backed standard back shut up and got forced surgical castration performed on them by the government.

It did mention insolvency both in the title and the first sentence. It has been silently updated.
Most likely explanation: Coinbase and their friends panicked because of the pdf posted, then though about it for 2 minutes (or read the Hacker News thread were lots of arguments pointing to a FUD campain were made in just 2 minutes) and changed the statement.

Mother fucking god of the gods!!!
If you laypeople don't realize that while playing with your cryptocurriencies and sometimes "earning" money you are really being played fucking hard by hollywood scale con artists, this should make it. The fucking suckers running all those "good" exchanges have been epicly scammed by a pro with powerpoint and u$d 50k to buy a domain name.

In a fractional reserve there is real money, and "IOU backed" money. In this debacles there is real bitcoin, and no-bitcoin-at-all-I-just-lied bitcoin. An analogy can't be made between "IOU backed" money on fractional reserves and no-bitcoin-at-all-I-just-lied bitcoin because the former is actually recognized and backed by the same laws as real money, whereas in Bitcoin the protocol only recognizes real bitcoin.
Until everyone *fucking understands* this, exchanged will blow up. While exchanges keep blowing up, there will be no mass adoption of Bitcoin. Since understanding this is hard and way above what people should be required to know to operate with a type of currency... o ghee please I'll not keep on explaining this here and loosing karma...
TLDR: No one in going fractional. The rich guys who opened exchanges are just getting richer by running away with your money.

Someone at Techcrunch bought some bitcoins...

So a marketplace for shady SEO services now accepts a cryptocurrencly most widely known to be associated with designer drugs, scammy and inept exchanges, and bubbly volatility... But as every seasoned bitcoiner knows, Bitcoin is really about making millonaries out of libertarian and nerdy early adopters, and helping chinese and russian over the counter traffickers launder they money!
What could possibly go wrong!! Keep buying!!

Inflation was 33/34% tops the last 12 months, that's using the indexes that give the biggest rate.
Also, most Argentineans angry with the economy or the government are really interested in saving money. And if you put your pesos in a fixed rate investment fund here, you get about 15/16% yearly on them. So the peso has not been as bad as Bitcoin yet if you just want to save money and avoid inflation.
Bitcoin is very useful for people wanting to engage in international transactions for services or goods that can somehow avoid customs, but if that's more than say 10% of Argentina's population it would be stretching it... and that would be counting migrant workers sending money home and drug dealers, who already have their own networks set up that are usually less expensive than going to bitcoin and back to dollars or whatever currency they want.

Maybe is he wasn't actually running a million dollar drug market online from a public library when they caught him, he could like not be in prison.

What OP is doing is not illegal in Argentina. It's up to his team to choose to legally declare their earnings and they'd get far less than a 30% cut if they just want to pay income taxes, I'd say about 6% or 8% depending on the province.
