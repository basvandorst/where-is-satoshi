Not following now, if a standard 250 byte transaction are now clearing with 50 sat/k fees wouldn't the USD price for the fees be around $0.00164? Also, do you have an ID for any transaction that has gone through with 50sat/k?

I quoted your 50sat/k and did the math, so numbers aren't from any "dodgy fee estimation". But as you said, you meant 50sat/b so then all looks good. Nice that the fee's are dropping from the absurdity we've seen the last couple of months. But still, it would be nice to be able to do smaller transactions with Bitcoin without having to pay let's say 50% in fee's.

We don't need bigger blocks! Segwit and LN is the solution to all scaling issues that we see today. Do not buy into the shills spreading that the solution is bigger blocksizes! We have always been behind core and the 1mb blocks. Bcash already pumped up the blocksize, why should we follow them, didn't we disapprove of their blocksize increase because of the centralization issues that will come from that?

So basically, hardware wallets depending on SPV-nodes is not ideal for Bitcoin. "Everyone" having a hardware wallet should also be running a full node on the side to ensure the decentralized future of Bitcoin.

If you need to lend money, I guess you wont have any direct benifits with using btc?

Well, I have used bt.cx for purchases before, fast delivery and the platform is easy to use. Only issue that I've had is that they couldn't send BTC to a Segwit address. Don't know if that has been fixed yet though.

Buying and selling on some exchange without taking fee's into account?

If I remember correctly the owner of that car is the man who runs bt.cx.
