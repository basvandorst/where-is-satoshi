When someone sets high amount of btc to sell and people have to buy off that number, it takes awhile
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:35
Currently dying
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:34:17
its so fun to look at, everydoby who panic sold are now buying in and constantly rising the price up, hehe. It obvious that its a small dip before 20k, when it hits 20k it not going down for sure
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:58:22

@_date: 2017-12-13 23:47:16

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:07
**feeling bad, miserable right now? Remember, there is people who bough BCH at his ATH, that should make you feel better**
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:59:34
Look at this shit, some one is literaly pumping bitcoin from 16.7k to 16.9k already now
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:03
i mean making a deposit through a credit card and sending funds into exchanges. I feel like so many transactions like this are stuck right now due the traffic, and people are so mad that they missed 10k dip, not even talking about alt coins. pretty much all of them are 50% down
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:29:42
Fuckin 1.1k wtf is this shit, and so like why is everybody buying now when price was like 16.5k 30mins ago? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:42
Cashed out at 18k or so,im here just for fun
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:34:37
nothing, just sad to see that everyone is selling rn little by little, but the whales are sleeping still, so we good i think
imagine if this one big boi drops a 20k btc for sale(you can see in history he dropped 3k couple times today and brought back same amount one hour later or so, because that 3k fuck up market and caused chain reaction only because of him) , everyone would lose their minds and start selling
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:01:46
price is raised from 16.3k to 16.6k this mean you guys who sold should panic buy now, thanks
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:32
oh, okay. Thank you for info
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:33:12
What lmao, did he cancel order or sum
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:55
Shits on fire yo
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:49
lets go bois keep pushing into 16k
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:05
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:16
market cap was 319b today, now its at 295b where dem billions at 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:37:00
hodl on tight then:) last weekend when futures began everybody started losing their shit selling so they dipped price to 14k or so, and when futures ended price was 16.5k~ and never dipped below 16k yet, just chill. What you see is couple million people who recently joined in this bitcoin game selling their 0.01 btc, thinking they are smartasses so they can buy back when price is going to drop more, which is not going to happen, so eventualy they will buy back in when price is higher, its fun to watch
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:29
well, not everyone is able to use coinbase(like me) i wish it was available lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:33
I came here to brighten up someones day, if you hodl ripple, its ($1.22) 50% up today!
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:39:15
keep in mind, last weekends futures started at from 15k to 13.5k and then ended in 16.5k and never dipped below that
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:28:09
go be a noob somewhere else, we dont accept weak handers here
jst kidding, hodl and you will be fine
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:07:43
to ones who have weak hands or some shit, just transfer your bitcoins to wallet where u cant sell, like blockchain or something. Simple
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:45:06
30b marketcap gone? where? is this really is calm before a storm?(massive increase)
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:42:36
instead of dipping its rising significantly rn lmao
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:14
oh you actualy can sell in blockchain via pc, ok my bad
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:46
Binance, requires no verification whatsoever, just send some eth to balance there and buy in xrp/eth. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:28:20
whales are currently sitting on the beach on their private island drinking martinis and fucking multiple bichtes not giving a fuck about futures or any kind of shit
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:54:36
my bad, but you get the point. Guy under him has 119k btc's and he aint no exchange wallet
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:58:03
keep selling and dipping price newbies hhaha
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:38
we all did it at some point of our lifes, lets be honest
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:33:26
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:40:39
true, fuck it. im depositing some $ and waiting for drop. See you in my private island party in a month or so
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:14
i really suggest to trade some btc to bch for some fast profits, its gonna skyrocket like a mf that gdax/coinbase added it
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:01
it already hit 20k couple days ago
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:43
Rip hopes and dreams to lil cunts who wanted to buy lambo and sold on 12.8k
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:24
No worries, there is buch of ppl who bought at 20k
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:46:56
still no, i think it can go to 18k~ and then its good time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:36:52
to 0.50 cent? HAHHAHAAAAAAA
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:30
Good, even better when you still hold on your opinion strongly even when btc price is dropping significantly. Well, i doubted and left btc with some profit in my pockets into some alt coins. Take a perspective - who is most likely to get you a 100% return lets take ltc for example which is $300 and only needs to hit $600 to make 100% return for you, and btc needs to hit 30k from 15k right now which is not going to happen, especialy now when people is running away from this bct bch war and investing into some atl coins. Not trying to be a smartass here, just sharing my opinion. Investing in crypto is best way to make money right now, well besides selling drugs lmao
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:37
bch 8.5k
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:59:39
hhaha its buy time if that happens
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:25:08
why is everybody selling lmao
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:16
what the fuck is this 9.5k seriously? its not legal to do such things
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:33:38
The real question is - do you really believe in it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:44:35
from 320b market cap to 266b, in less than 2 days lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:27
if you hold minimal amout - yes, if you bought when btc when it was below 10k then no. There is alot alt coins where you can make money. Take a perspective of 0.04ct coin and bitcoin which is 16k what is most likely make a 100% profit for you? 0.04 to 0.08 coin is not much, but btc from 16k to 32k is not likely to happen anytime soon. Nothing bad about bitcoin, i still own some of it, but its a reaaaaaaaaally long term investment
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:41:34
so, anything bout to happen? or we just sitting here and doing nothing? 2:41am here, cmon do something btc
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:38:02
18k soon?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:30
9.5k per 1 bch
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:19:46
dont get me wrong im still a btc hodler. 57% btc 21% eth 20% ltc, really debating to pump those ltc numbers up because who dosent like free money?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:48:15
buy the dip that is happening rn
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:30
can we see futures live or smth? or get any news live?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:26:32
get out and invest in trx, thank me 1 week later
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:17:32
imagine people who tried to buy but transaction times are way to long to catch the dips. Rest in pepperoni
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:01:23
saw this topic and people complaining about cex and got my ass off it as fast as i could, thank you guys damn
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:37
to be fair that coinbase just added BCH into their market its gonna skyrocket, im not supporting it by any means but im buying just for fast profit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:12:29
165 is nothing
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:09:11
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:17:20
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:32
prayers go for lower price lol, im hodler myself and i would liket o see approx $10k~ so i could go all in like other people and make price skyrocket. it may be money just throwing money into fire, or becoming rich. One or other lmao
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:03
why not only btc but also eth and ltc dropping significantly?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:46:54

rip wall
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:29
the more time passes the more i understand if we hodl and dont panic market would be stable lmao. We need to spread message across the globe to the newbies who bought in last week to hodl their btc if they planning to get rich in close future
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:47:45
Close to 22k, what is happening? Why is everyone suddently buying?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:27
