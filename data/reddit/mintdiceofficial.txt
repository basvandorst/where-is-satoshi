Seems like more buzzword news but I still suspect this type of thing to become more prevalent with time, not less so, since financial freedom is obviously quite important on both individual and greater scales.

Lightning is great and definitely allows more tipping, up to the point that people are using it. It's kind of how like Bitcoin was back in the day - there was easy on chain tipping with few people using it.

I wonder if he'll ever raise the stakes to 2 million. Maybe its something he wants to do and just needs an excuse to do it.

Don't worry, a Blockstream® sidechain payment channel brought to you by Wells Fargo® will be available Next Year™.

It also potentially could not hit $40,000. It could go both ways which really shows different possibilities if you think about it.

Pretty neat. You're only going to get a select few people that ever say anything but that makes it worth it enough :)

Bitcoin is fine, but if you want to look at others just go to  and click on the coins then go to their website/announcement to see what tech features they offer

Bitcoin isn't as useful as it used to be since its pretty expensive to transfer at the moment until there's a proper fix.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:02:55
depends how rich/generous you are but having bitcoin preloaded on a hardware wallet such as trezor would be really nice of you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:05
This is true but what if you don't and you always end up wondering "what if"? If you wonder you'll always wonder.

I'm pretty sure the answer is no, and in the few cases that may exist you're going to subject yourself to higher risk because they may either be scam exchanges or exchanges that will one day be targeted by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government mandates that anyone using USD provide their SSN since FATCA was put into place back in 2012.
While it's important that you abide by the laws of any country and pay your taxes, if you were to conduct crypto to cash transactions within your territory, this may be one of the only methods in the realm of what you are referring to.

Does anyone know what the ROI is on Bolivars that are printed by the Venezuelan government is? When they print so much paper and it contains so little value, it would almost seem like there would be a pretty high cost at the end of the day.

Not very. But if you use the various coin maps you can find vendors that accept it in various locations. I've had fun with this personally because it gives me cool ideas for things to do and takes me to locations I would have otherwise never stumbled across.

If Satoshi's coins moved then you would likely see a short term panic sell off. If Satoshi did then attempt to sell some coins then you'd also obviously expect to see the price drop over time simply due to supply and demand. It is a concern but personally, I'd worry about many other things before worrying about this.

India's oppressive regime shows what happens when governments take an inch; they can eventually take a mile. They removed medium and large denomination cash bills and other financial freedoms which disproportionately affect poor people. Let alone bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:38:30
If you truly wanted to own your own money electronically and not expose yourself to risk, you could take a position in Bitcoin and then do a leveraged short on Bitmex to do an offset hedge. Doesn't seem like a very practical option, but it still exists. It could make sense in some particularly volatile regions like Venezuela for example.

This is a hard path for many companies to use because of the prevalence of fraud. It also largely defeats the purpose of fiat and Bitcoin.
I don't entirely understand your need for this particular service either. If you were to use an exchange, like coinbase, you could just buy Bitcoin with a credit card and then send the Bitcoins which would effectively be exactly what you are talking about with one extra step - not a big deal.

He said that we should keep it [fiat] the way it has always been. Because you know, for all of human history fiat was a thing.

Well, we think we've done a good job at incorporating all features users find most important. For brevity's sake, there's some high quality sites out there that don't offer investing or skill gaming, and some sites that do offer investing or skill gaming but bad graphics or user experience. We think we've brought those together better than any other option with a growing road map to come. Hopefully that answers your question :)

I think that the countries that need Bitcoin the most are the least likely to use it because they lack the technology, information, intelligence or infrastructure to make proper uses out of it. Meanwhile, the countries that don't need Bitcoin quite as much but would contain the above structures have relatively well functioning fiat systems in place.
The larger problem with your idea is that a lot of these corrupt nations control their nations by corrupt handling of their monetary system. They cannot do this with Bitcoin, which gives them less power and control. So their incentive to go down this path is quite small. Once crossed, it could definitely work out as you say but the valley of death in between is a near impossible stretch to cross in the present meta in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:23:56
Thank you for the nice feedback
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:33:24
Very little. The best thing to do is use a lot of high quality preventative measures. A Trezor is a very helpful device for securing your bitcoin so I'd suggest getting one of those.
If you don't know the person that stole it from you, the chance of you getting it back is quite small. And unless it's an obscenely high amount, very few people, exchanges or regulatory bodies will care.

Wow man, that is deep.

I'm pretty sure Elon Musk and Bernie Sanders can figure this one out so long as Trump doesn't get in the way of this plan or any firefighters.

I'm pretty sure a government could still survive but they would have their power dramatically reduced which is why they don't want to surrender control of the money supply.
But ultimately, this isn't too hard to figure out: If a centralized body has all of the guns/tanks/missiles and demands tribute based on your presumed economic activity, you can either comply or die.
I think the reasonable solution is for a dramatic reduction in the size of government, which Bitcoin can help accommodate for, but I doubt many reasonable people want to see the elimination of all government.

That's awesome! Spreading the BTC love.

Along with JAXX, look into Ledger Nano S, or Trezor for hardware wallets. Otherwise you can consider a paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:00:07
I'd also recommend Bitstamp, or alternatively, Kraken is pretty decent if you're planning to buy a larger amount.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:52:44
That's great! It's always important to keep in mind that you can lose your investment. There's always more to learn and more to earn ;)
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:16:54
Correct :)

That was some pretty good foresight from this individual, I have to say.
