Gox was caused by server wallets not being as good. It was caused by far too much trust in a centralized service that had a long track record of being poorly run.

I agree that is very interesting, and the right direction but often the solutions VCs are backing are not similar to this.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:07:15
Great point, this was a very interesting step forward in my opinion and network based rewards like this are the right direction.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:23:28
I don't see what point you are trying to make, there were still other options.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:27:27
No this is more BTC moving into the hands of scammers, its not good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 12:10:38
This is the wrong move though, we shouldn't be praising centralized services. We should be focusing on developers are building decentralized solutions.

In case you are not aware, GAW has been investing a lot of their efforts into their new cryptocurrency called "Paycoin" (formerly called Hashcoin). While anyone is to welcome make their own judgment, I personally believe it is a scam.
The gist of the coin is that people were "allowed" to save up their profits from cloud mining as "hashpoints," rather than cashing out Bitcoin. Miners could then use $4 worth of otherwise useless hashpoints to purchase this new Paycoin.
But why would a miner want to do that? Well, because GAW is "guaranteeing" a 400% profit margin on day 1. They claim that they have banking partners and investors that will put up $100 million to make sure the price stays above $20, and that they expect it to go even higher than that. (The coin is supposedly live now and on coinmarketcap, but I wouldn't count it as truly live until miners are actually given the coins they are promised.)
But of course, no legitimate institution has stepped forward to lend their credibility to the project. The only name they've given out is "Stuart Fraser" of Cantor Fitzgerald LP,a financial services firm, but there is no public confirmation of this aside from GAW's own press releases.
I'm guessing this might turn out like MintPal, where by the time you have absolute certainty of the scam, it's already too late. Better to get your money out before that point. I know many in the BlackCoin community had been buying GAW cloud miners, so figured this is worth talking about here.
GAW is also notorious for censoring their own forums, so don't be surprised to come across shills and other such tactics at bitcointalk and other places (and the usual pump/dump crowd, of course).
Some links:
 (Paycoin site, has links to re-blogged press releases)
 (Old FAQ, not sure if something is more recent but this details their claims to pump up the coin with unnamed banks and investors)
 (r/bitcoin thread alleging GAW purchased a news site to shill for Paycoin)
 (Previous r/blackcoin thread with link to another GAW scam r/bitcoin thread)
 (Points out instances of GAW lying about associations with Target, Amazon, Walmart, and pool users discovering that cloud hashes pointed at their own pools didn't increase hash rate (i.e., don't really exist))
 (Another cloud hash/Paycoin summary thread pointing out some red flags, speculation, and various info)

You can't monetize decentralized and distributed systems, at least ones that actually have impactful change. They often take out the middlemen which is typically where money is made.
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:36:20
Really nice looking, are you going to add USD pairings?
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:12:23
Because purely seeking profit leads to short term thinking. It was quite profitable to wrap up bad loans together, get certifying companies to say they were good then gamble on them, but despite that it hurt the economy. It is quite profitable to fish without concern for the aquatic ecosystem, but if done to the extreme we overfish and lose a food source like any stupid predator.
@_date: 2014-12-01 02:19:40
You are assuming logical consistency is important, which it is not.

They care about ponzi schemes, and GAW mining is a ponzi scheme. XPY is away to cover the loses of the GAW mining ponzi scheme to continue it further. Buying the exchange is part of the plan to continue to manipulate the volume and try to keep the price high while they maintain control of current and future coin supply with their premine and changes to the code that allow holders of their private keys to PoS at a much much higher rate than normal.
@_date: 2014-12-01 04:34:50
Why couldn't this have been done without an additional blockchain?
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:25:29
Its more than another altcoin, this is already 3rd in market cap. Its already grown bigger than Litecoin in a month and has a massive premine and built in control over the money.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:12:53
Absolutely this.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:09:44
The community has the choice to use their products and to give them free advertising. Voting with your bitcoins is important.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:30:38
Bitcoin is community fiat, which is ironic I know considering people here love to call government fiat just fiat.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:57:44
This one is in progress and coinmarketcap.com the marketcap site for cointelegraph shows they have 150 million dollar market cap and are the third largest cryptocurrency. So this is bigger than your average altcoin bullshit.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:08:32
How does a decentralized system create a return on their investment? How do you make profit when there are no middlemen or central points of control? Many amazing ideas wouldn't be invented if we only looked for ideas that would make a profit for a group of investors.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:35:33
I hope so, but I think what might actually happen is they become entrenched and then progress stagnates. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:09:48
Didn't this get spammed here yesterday?
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:33:29
Bitcoin isn't a business, Bitcoin is a protocol, a piece of technology. The businesses they build ontop of Bitcoin are centralized and bypass and ignore a lot of the most revolutionary features of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:38:32
Putting all your eggs in one basket? Sounds good.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:59:23
The ponzi scheme is actually centralized service. Also you can support decentralized currency and believe there should be checks on bad actors. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:28:07


This coin is a scam. They have hardcoded control over the money supply, premiend it massively and manipulated the price. Its different than your average fork.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:39:22
I think centralized services will take over, possibly be good enoguh bring in mainstream users who don't truly understand the potential of underlying technology. People will be too complacent to create or move to better but less polished decentralized solutions because they aren't as nicely marketed and designed and technological progress will likely stagnate.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:08:59
Why should we care about investors? That is why people think we are creating a ponzi scheme. I don't care about people who are just trying to make money (those are the same people who gambled and tanked the economy - the news mentioned in the genesis block), to me Bitcoin can be worth 1 USD again and it would still accomplish the same technological feats.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:07:04
Are you really suggesting that profit seeking bankers gambling on loans they knew were bad was not a factor? And that mindless profit seeking doesn't have negative impacts on the environment and worker conditions?
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:58:48
Stop being so naive, there is no good and evil. That is a childish world view. Corruption exists in both the private and public sector, checks and balances are important. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:55:51
Under this logic, murder has been around a long time and reporting it is a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:16:38
No when you start pushing that amount above 700 BTC, 0.5-1% trading fees becomes expensive each day. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:58:08
It is more about the ponzi scheme they are running, purchasing the exchange just lets them fake volume for free. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:10:47
Are you sure? The genesis block was an article regarding banks, which most of the profit goes to private investors.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:27:57
This coin is a scam. They have hardcoded control over the money supply, premiend it massively and manipulated the price. Its different than your average fork.

If they aren't then the CEO is lying about affiliations to boost the price.
@_date: 2014-12-01 04:35:44
Dont see why this needs an additional blockchain, all of this could be done with a DHT ontop of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:05:27
That is not true, I have been around since 2010 and Gox was just the biggest and everyone was complacent. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:32:29
Bitcoin is not a business, thats just a fact. Its not a argument template.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:11:31
I already bought one with BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:59:49
Did you bother to do research? Look at the exchange they bought and the trade history. Its pretty fucking clear. This is all apart of a much larger ponzi scheme dealing with bitcoin mining. When this blows up its gonna hurt everyone, not just those involved.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:58:27
Everyone is not against regulation. Stop assuming shit. 
Without regulation one of the most profitable business models is orchestrating scams. We need some ability to stop this thing and it is quite clear that the cryptocommunity is unwilling or unable to regulate it self. Shit like Paycoin is a prime example.
@_date: 2014-12-01 12:28:01
Oh great centralized solutions, so this is absolutely with out a doubt terrible. This could be done in a decentralized way without needing any additional blockchain or centralized DB.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:02:19
And Google started with the stupid motto "Don't be evil", it doesn't mean much after a period of time. But I do appreciate the concept of trying to write software to make your current software irrelevant.

It looks relatively new, there is a possibility they are going to add it in the future. It would be nice to see more BTC/USD exchanges with full proof of reserves, I hope this is successful.

Poor time to advertise - will never use this site.

You don't have to be an empoyee to be a shill, look at all the people who support GAW mindlessly.

This is how the free market corrects things, people vote with their feet. Customers get to decide on what change they want by picking the companies they want to support.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:51:57
You do fix ponzi scams by closing access off access to them and not providing them legitimacy. 
Your advertisements are everywhere and that brings them attention and legitimacy when you sell their coin.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:34:32
Haha "seems very tight"? What expertise do you have? What makes you think it seems tight?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:43:39
This is a good point that a lot of people would like to not think about.

Many newer exchanges sign the addresses they own proving they have ownership over them. These older exchanges haven't bothered to get with the times.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:18:27
The free market is not a system of checks and balances. In fact in a completely free market without any regulation allows for all sorts of corrupt practices that are profitable but still undesirable. Your notions are childish.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:33:04
What an asshole way to advertise, but not surprising coming from Kraken. 
They are very slimy. Like the way they bought all the domains near mtgox.com and redirected it to them, or got involved with supposed distribution of funds to get people to sign up.
@_date: 2014-12-01 13:34:53
I don't think these centralized services they are offering is as valuable as they would like to believe, and it fundamentally comes down to the fact that they don't use decentralized/distributed designs. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:36:23
The grim fact is that in a completely free market, scamming isn't a bad business model. That is why regulation exists.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:35:29
Because this person who is a shill for Kraken. They do this every time another exchange takes PR damage, they are slimy as fuck.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:21:23
Hydroeletric dams are not good for the environment either, there are better ways to secure a network than competitive mining. If you aren't religious about it, we can actually progress otherwise you get the Abrahamic religion of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:02:49
Guess people into Bitcoin don't like thinking about the reality of all the unnecessary electricity consumption from competitive mining? It is a clever system but it has flaws, this being one of the biggest.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:20:36
I don't think Facebook is good so you aren't getting an argument from me on that. They don't do things efficiently, they connect people in an extremely shallow way, they sell data and its not open source. 
Pointing out flaws in Facebook is not a good argument for Bitcoin's unnecessary electricity use due to competitive mining. It is by definition a straw man or red herring.

No they would not have handed them back, they would have kept them. The police takes assets all the time without much grounds to buy "big boy toys".
