And where exactly is Satoshi?
Can you put a name to a face?
Granted, I dont know enough about Roger Ver to say anything about him, but I'm damn sure I can put a face to a name with him.
Please explain how BCH is delaying the issue, given they have scaleable blocks that can take more than 1MB of transactions at once, plus next to nothing fees as we sit at a limited 1MB system with $20-$70 fees to move anything.
LN might solve it, but when will it come out?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:23:34
...Except LN does not exist yet and isnt being used.
Maybe once it's being used you will have a point, but until then, it's just hopeful thinking backed by nothing more than a name.
I hope the best for LN but until it comes out and gets tested, I wouldnt hold your breath on it

Cutting off the nose to spite the face much?

Why pump lightning if it still has yet to come out?
What if it has yet to come out because it is using the current segwit to send the code bit by bit? 
Jokes aside, making the blocks scale and fixing the node problem (I know little about nodes so please bear with me as all I know is there is an issue with people running full nodes) is the way to go for now.
I just want to see BTC live up to what it is supposed to be, the universal currency, whether that be gold or the common cash, I just want to see it come back.

Slippery slope, eh?
I doubt it will ever go past 8 mb.
Highest I ever saw it was 1.06MB or something similar.
And it's ironic, given how banks have thrown money at the parent of Blockchain, creating a sort of centralization.
Why bother running a node at all? It's not worth the cost in power to the return you get.

You can very well own both, but why would you want to own something that you cant move?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:05:39
You would think, but it still has yet to be rolled out.

Oh so now it's a biblical thing?
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness..."
You want to go biblical, please at least be self-aware of it.
Oh and also...
Matthew 5:44 "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"

Lightning network?
You mean the network that was supposed to take 6 months but still isn't here?
I'm all for a new network, I just want to see it come out and be used.

Complaining will help in the way of letting it be known. 
I'm sure people already know but still, it needs to be evident that change must occur if we want to stop shooting for the moon and shoot even higher.
Block size will absolutely help. Lightning network? Has yet to be seen 2 years later. : /

Obviously not.
But this has had years to do so.
Lightning will not fix the broken arm that is the state of Bitcoin.
Perhaps once it comes out, it will.
A rushed product is bad, and a late project is good eventually.
However, if it never comes out, it will always have a higher bar set to it given the time it has had.
BCH is not the bandaid to a broken arm of BTC.
It's not a fix, it's an alternative.
BCH isn't trying to fix BTC, it's competing with it. 
That's why BCH and BTC go up when the other is down.
They are fighting for control.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:13:17
But then what about Satoichi?
He is the face of BTC, no?
Every coin has a face or a team name.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:22:13
We were supposed to.
Until we didn't and banks rolled in.
It's ironic, really.
I'm probably not the best person to talk on this but there are a lot of issues with BTC that need fixing but it falls on deaf ears.
