Too late, bloodbath has already subsided. TO DA MOON!
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:38:31
Certainly not the worst idea I've ever seen lol. It's like going to a garage sale blindfolded. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:04:39
That's a bold statement, all things considered lol.

Welcome to the wonderful world of bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:44:48
Holding. Small dip, it'll be back to 1,100 ish by mid afternoon. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:08:20
Yep. You caught them. Their grand heist of .5 bitcoin! They've been planning on trashing their reputation for this all along. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:30:22
Yup. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:59:11
Unfortunately, most people do not think for themselves. They must gain there approval from outside sources. In this particular case, the government. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:37:56
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the gains were MUCH higher than that. Like 8X higher.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:18:41
Well you can already purchase pretty much anything with it using snapcard. 
Why do you need a card when you have a phone?
Sure, you can make large purchases now.
Sales tax depends on what state you are in.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:35:17
Looks and sounds like a solid Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:14:19
Very true. I'll be sure to mention that. 
What about the transactions themselves? How does the dealership set it up through bitpay?
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:44:06
Merchant acceptance in the US that makes China buzz again at the idea of making exponential gains from buying it as a commodity while we use it as a currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:29:08
Check out joinsnapcard.com. Then pick any place online :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:49:31
Their policies could certainly reverse, if they were sure there was something in it for them, just like any other government would.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:16:17
Jesus, how did I not see it before??
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:03:41
That'd be nice. But I couldn't see the banks insuring them if their system got hacked. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:32:30
You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can break them up to micro, nano and beyond!
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:02:42
This. The guys at snapcard are great! Have placed several orders already. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:27:32
Back to business as usual.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:26:32
China can pressure other governments all they want. If we listened to China about every social/economic issue, we'd be a very different nation. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:35:47
Been in since January of this year. Not getting out anytime soon. 
All the SELL SELL SELL posts are coming from those who bought in recently. I'm pretty happy with my 4,000% gains this year. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:12:18
That's reassuring. What about setting up the transaction? What service could be used to process the transaction? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:25:31
With a quick rebound. Only down about 350 on the day now :P
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:32:41
It's a possibility. However, I think the more likely explanation is control. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:02:34
Unless you invested pre-October...
What did you invest in this year that netted you 4000% if not bitcoin, Mr. Cool?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:31:52
When the market determines what its value is. There really aren't any time parameters. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:18:02
Only if you're in for the long haul. I bet we hit the 400s again several times more in 2013. And there are only 2 weeks left in the year haha. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:50:14
Some people don't understand that CHINA IS NOT LOST.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:19:16
From what I understood, it cannot be used as currency because it does not fit their definition of "currency."
IE it is not issued or backed by any government or central authority.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:57:48
I'm aware of that. But what about a dealership that does not yet accept bitcoin? How could I set them up to process the transaction if I wanted to buy a car with my bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:13:07
If it's money you can afford to lose it, go for it.
All I'll say is bitcoin has the most potential for monumental gain out of anything else right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:38:07
Lol @ cancelled Tesla orders.
No idea in regards to your question though. Lower than now, that's for sure. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:37:57
The best fluctuation happens between 2 am and 6 am though!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:51:09
Depends on who it was lol. If it was Bill Gates, it'd be a pretty positive reaction. If it was George Zimmerman, probably not so much. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:13:44
Considering this is pretty much libel, I'd say you are the dick. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:53:47
From what I understand, most go through Bitpay. They get a lock in guarantee of the btc price when the customer checks out. However, if you buy on a dip, you aren't getting the most out of your money. So, really you're hurting yourself more than the merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:43:00
Yep, they sure do, you just have to provide a valid Chinese ID or passport to trade on their exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:24:17
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:44:29
That's kinda what I figured. Awesome, thanks! Hopefully the owner of the dealership is open minded!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:16:16
And it's the few with 10K+ invested that never freak out about the price lol. I've got well over 50K invested and was LOLing at all the posts last night when we were hitting 450.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:53:40
Once the adoption stage passes, prices will stable out. No telling how long that could take though. The market cap needs to be a lot higher than 11 billion USD though, I know that much. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:27:29
Well I sold about 70 coins the other day at $950 to buy an asset. I'm holding on to the rest of mine for the long haul, aside from a chilis gift card every now and again!
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:10:30
Doubt it. This isn't the first time this has happened. Went to a new high within the next couple of days, if I remember correctly. 850 is still over 8X what it was in early October. Enough with all this crashing nonsense. It's getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:45:50
Based on what? Your immense knowledge of free market economies?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:32:07
Nice article.
