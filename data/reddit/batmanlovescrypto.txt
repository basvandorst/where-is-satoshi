You see? Bitcoin is not mainstream yet!
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:50:52
That's weird cause it happens to me too. I think we are unconciously synchronized!

You can purchase some with a VISA through Coinbase.com.
Or you could open an account on Kraken.com or Bitstamp.net and send money there with a SWIFT or SEPA transfer.
Would that work?

Wow, would be awesome if you could find that! Good luck buddy!

Do you know a lot of cryptos more used in the real economy than Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash ? Please teach me something, I'm always eager to learn.

Time machine is the answer to all problems.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:52:37
Good points, thanks for taking the time.
I know BCH devs are paid. That's bad because the employer controls the code, but it's good because they'd have the means to innovate. I agree it's not ideal.
My concern is more about the BTC devs being actives and independent. Do you know something about that ? (honest question).
You know the only thing I wish was different for BTC? I'd love it to be cheaper for transactions (not now, but when the TX will be back again, the fees will be high again sadly). And I honnestly don't understand why the community is ok with that. Ok, work on lightning for some specific use cases, but why not fix this issue? It's the only strength of BCH. Fix this and it's an instant kill for BCH. I want cheeeeap tx on chain. It is technically doable, BCH did it.
Why don't devs do it? Is there a hidden agenda here?
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:30:49
For sure, the problem is teaching everyone to open a channel, and commit X bitcoins there. I don't know if thay plan on using Lightning Network though. I'll look for some details.

Hey, I wish man! But I don't think so. It would be amazing to see Doge at the top, I'm serious here!

@_date: 2018-08-13 15:46:34
Ok buddy, I don't see the interest of continuing this conversation with you.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:20:39
Mmmm, I fear we are going to have a fee problem there.

About Venezuela, I talked to this girl and people having travelled there.
Take a look, I think it's interesting:
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:15:03
1. Don't compare BCH with other bitcoin forks, you know BCH is one of the most used cryptos.
2. I think Etsy has a market cap of around 5.5B. I'm not saying they are for sale, but Bitmain's buying power is huge. Open your mind.
Also, do you always downvote when you disagree with someone else opinion ?
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:07:22
Ok, maybe, I guess we'll never know. But I try to get away from conspiracy theories from time to time and believe that not 100% ofthe people there are puppets. I guess they say the same about this subreddit, so I hope you get my point.
But you know what would reallyhelp ? You guys being more open minded and less radical. That would be amazing for the community.
I love Bitcoin, the real. But I like to learn about other cryptos as well and I like a good open minded conversation when I can find one.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:13:55
Ok, no problem.
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:32:06
We'll have to wait 5 years or so to talk about this again, you never know.

March 2014 news. Get out.
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:39:16
Amazon is just an example. A lot of huge web retailers have a market cap Bitmain could afford. Amazon has a market cap of 930B I see, so it's out of reach, but Etsy for instance is not.
Can you imagine what could happen?
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:01:04
Thanks, I'll do further research on the role of blockstream and the founder.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:43:48
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:04:01
True, but I guess a lot of money into Bitcoin comes from the US. Maybe more than from Europe for instance? I don't really know. Anyways, since the USD is the reference, I don't know how this would affect the world economy. 20% is a lot.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:15:29
How do you store your seeds in them?
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:57:17
Hard to tell. I think that would be bad for the whole economy. People would have less buying power so they might invest less in Bitcoin, maybe?
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:48:05
Misleading title implying they started buying cryptos because of the US leaving the nuclear deal.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:00:02
English is not my native language, I'm not american, and I'm pretty sure I know more languages than you do, but whatever man, you have your opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:59:32
I understand what you say, it’s interesting.
What I don’t know is how cheap could the fees be without failing to incentivise the miners. I hope they were cheaper on chain though. For me, it will be the defenitive win for bitcoin. That and validation time.
Also, blockstream being behind Bitcoin worries me as much as Roger Ver being behind Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:42:31
Hahhaha, yeah, nobody would accept BCH forthat matter, but if their IPO succeeds...
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:36:41
You're right about OTC, there would be a huge discount. But I think Bitmain has a hidden joker somewhere. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:47:12
Interesting thoughs on this Twitter thread.
However, I'm not sure Bitmain couldn't sell the BCH holdings without lowering the price. They could do it little by little or partially through OTC.
Moreover it would not make sense selling at the current prices.
And finally, with the cash they have, they could very well create an ecosystem where BCH could be the native currency. I don't know, imagine they  could buy Etsy, or Amazon or eBay or something similar (I don't know how much they are valuated, it's an example), and include BCH payments. BCH price could skyrocket.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:00:30
Not true. Hey, hate all you want, but deep inside you know you're wrong. It's just you hate BCH too much to admit it... ;)
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:18:31
You might be right. I guess we'll never know.
But I don't see a real one coming here either for a true conversation. That's sad.
If they go there, they are fake. If they come here, they are trolls and you ban them cause they talk about other cryptos. What's the solution to get an interesting coversation ?
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:28:10
Weird reaction from Wright, but out of respect, the Bitcoin Gold guy should have spoken english. You always use the common language in those cases. Not cool for english only speaking guys in the conference. Wright was the only one with the balls to call that out. But I say again, weird reaction afterwards.
Edit: Really? Downvoting this comment? You guys need to attend more international conferences. I'm not defending Wright's attitude, just saying that the other guy speaking local language is disrespectful to the foreign attendants. He could have been criticizing Wright or others without them knowing, so that's not cool.
Please, don't be blind radicals, ok? You should be able to differentiate concepts here.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:00:57
Why would you invite english speaking people if you don't have the intension to communicate with them? Come on!
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:02:58
I don't know for sure, but he is not the only "occidental" guy in there. Maybe they know the local language, I can't tell by their looks, but if you invite someone that does not speak the local language, it's common courtesy to speak the language everyone understands, and in those kind.of conferences, that would be english.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:04:35
You don't know that, did you hear everyone? And if you don't intend to speak english, why the fuck do you invite him? You are ridiculous. I don't defend Craig, that's not the point here. If you don't like him, I don't care, but the point still stands.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:21:17
Thanks! I'm not defending Wright's attitude, but the other guy speaking another language was disrespectful to the non local attendants.
@_date: 2018-05-13 13:36:51
Of course! It’s designed to make people believe the banks are issuing this message.
I love the concept.
I should print some and hang them in my city...  Near the ATMs to be exact.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:53:35
Ok, you're right on this one, bad thing to assume, sorry for that.
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:34:41
What I say is that when you look at retail stores, the main accepted cryptos are BTC and BCH (amongst LTC and ETH as well). And when you talk to people in Venezuela, they say they mainly use BCH (I'm not sure why, but I guess it's because of the fees).
So that alone makes me say it's more used than other Bitcoin forks. Litecoin and Ethereum are also very used yes, but that doesn't mean BCH is not.
Guys, I don't care about BCH, I don't hold any (though I'm considering it), I just look for an interesting conversation to exchange opinions and learn.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:19:33
That's exactly my point, thanks. If you invite english attendants and people from over the world, english is the standard, wherever you are.
Sorry but that's reality.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:27:14
I'm aware that Roger Ver (anda lot of his friends) are not honest. He's shady, I agree.
But that does not mean some things on their project aren't good.
I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson's acts, but his music is awesome.
Steve Jobs was horrible to a lot of employees, but the man had a great vision.
People's personality don't always reflect their work.
@_date: 2019-03-01 07:57:52
Personnally, I don’t care anymore. If it comes, it comes, and if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. I’m tired of these no news. They use this to manipulate the prices and prolong the bear market.

@_date: 2019-02-05 20:00:38
If the unstabillity is an issue, why do exchanges allow to buy and sell USDT for more or less than $1? Why not just always force the order at $1?
They could just change the UI for the stable coins and voilà. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:51:17
Good reminder !
@_date: 2019-02-06 09:29:44
I think it's better to chose a specific algo you want to mine (do some research for profitability), then install the specific miner (not nicehash's), and point it to a native pool (and then exchange the coins for whatever you want), or point the algo to the nicehash pool amd get paid in bitcoins.
Anyway, with the power you got don't expect to make a lot.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:15:48
I saw the interview, and I understood that he is okay with bitcoin privavy, but he doesn't think it's a good idea to have all the transaction history stored in a single blockchain forever.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:29:04
Good idea until the owner kick you out. He will notice your insane consumption very fast and make you pay for it probably. Also in the contract some kind of fare use must be stated.

How many Bitcoins does it cost? Like 10? 20?
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:51:50
As an owner of Bitcoin (let's say you mined them or bought them cheap), you decide to put them on sale on an exchange. Someone comes and buys them from the exchange (he will get some from your sell order and some from someone else, it doesn't matter). The result is you now have in USD what your sold Bitcoin were worth when you sold them.
Now let's say everyone sells their Bitcoins and the price drops cause a majority of people agree they don't want to pay that much (more people selling than buying). Okay, if you sell your bitcoins now, you'll get less for them than you did before.
And if you buy Bitcoins when they are cheap and sell them when they are expensive then you are making money because on the other side, someone is selling low and buying high.
Money does not disappear. If you lose someone wins, and viceversa.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:39:04
I hope you're right!!
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:54:20
I don't think so. There's too much demand to get to thoses prices IMO.
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:13:08
To get Bitcoin either you buy them, or you mine them, which also costs money. Maube you can convince someone to pay you in Bitcoin for your services.
Creating a wallet is free and can be done through an app on your smartphone for instance.

You have to ask in a different way:
How many USD is enough to retire for the rest of your life?
Let's say... $2M?
Then, if BTC gets to $1M, and you have 1 BTC in your portfolio, you'd have the equivalent of 0.5 retirements.
How does that sound? ;)
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:51:14
Brenda has a lot of money to spare to buy 10 BTC. Nice!
Edit: Oh, I read 10 BTC and not 10 minutes. My bad. I guess she's not that wealthy then.

Another option is to temporarily turn off equipments and buy coins with the electricity money (assuming you get more coins for the amount of fiat you were paying for electricity).

He must want to buy cheap BTC so it's in his interest to generate some good old FUD to help bring the price where he/they want.

I love it!
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:22:38
Yes!! And thinking about it, if you would preserve privacy, I think it would be better to mine the coins (and not to buy them) since you avoid transactions that could reveal who you are.
The cool thing is that if you mined super early, a simple CPU would to the trick.

Something isn’t consistant, you say McAfee won his bet, so BTC got to at least $1M by the end of 2020. But in another comment you say BTC gets from 100K to 20K in 2020. What is it then?

- How did the banking system fit into the Bitcoin ecosystem?
- What’s the percentage of usage of fiat vs bitcoin in the daily life?
- How did big fortunes adapt to this transition, and were they lying in 2018 about their intentions of investing?

@_date: 2018-12-28 22:09:01
I agree I'd love those companyies to use Bitcoin and other alts, but sadly they will make more money by creating their token. And if they do it right (which is not guaranteed) users could prefer their facecoin or whatsappcoin or googlecoin more. Simply because through millions in coherent marketing those brands would push them to their users.
Just imagine tomorrow, when you update whatsapp, you have a tab with a wallet. And they just gave you for free 10 whatsapp coins. But you can buy more (using fiat with your visa) at market price. And Binance just listed Whatsapp coin too, so now people can trade it for Bitcoin. The trick is in the whatsapp app, you can only send whatsapp coins. And you'll be able to buy stickers and other virtual objects too. And after that, whatsapp coin comes to Instagram (also owned by Facebook). And now you are paying those $10 you owed to your friend using whatsapp coin.
They won't have better tech. Their coins won't be decentralized. But will their users care ? Will tech outwin marketing ? Fuck, millions of users could make some money if whatsapp coin goes up in value too! That's what I fear.

Just to understand how it works... (I didn't find the info in the readme)
For it to work offline do you need a copy of the blockchain on the computer (to test the private keys and see if they have a balance), or does it simply check the format to know which restored private key is valid?
Thanks!
