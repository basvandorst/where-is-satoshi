We've had about 5-6 transactions so far. Doesn't happen very often, but hopefully as word grows we can do more.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:00:12
It truly is.

Thanks prophet. Had no idea coinbistro was a thing. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:02:06
If only!
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:52:27
Not currently. We're actually working on setting up our own website, where users can pay with Bitcoin from the comfort of their own home. To expressly come pick up at the shop.
Currently we use our FaceBook as a stand in:

Where's the fun in that?
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:04:50
Will do. Thank you for the links. So many sometimes it hard to keep track of them all. Altho I think we're on coinmap.
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:28:30
We'll take that as a compliment! haha
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:25:05
Definately not Mellow Mushroom. We're a local joint.

Good question. Since we do a majority of our transactions in more conventional methods (fiat/cash &amp; credit/debit) at this point it's hardly a  huge risk.  Also with the volatility, a decline today may be a incline tomorrow. We're confident in the concept and adoption of bitcoin, but at this stage it's a bit of an experiment, for our store in particular. We think it's here to stay.
While we hold our Bitcoin profits in Bitcoins at the moment if need be there's methods (our own Georgia based BitPay) that we are a patron of. We plan to use it to minimize risk as the profits from Bitcoin become more substantial.

Thank you very much rjs2k!

There is/was. And we are/were. At least at the time of adoption. And hell even a month or so ago according to the Bitcoin maps circulating the Interwebz.
We were also the second place in the Savannah area to do so. Which Savannah is a pretty happenin' place in GA. It was surprising to us too. At the time I checked most BTC stuff in Georgia was centered around Atlanta. But not one restaurant at the time. Bunch of other stuff tho.

Roma Pizza in Bloomingdale. We aren't in Savannah proper. But don't hold that against us haha.
@_date: 2014-03-28 05:02:22
Right on! Come on down!
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:05:25
Much appreciated nimanator.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:50:58
Right on. Thank you very much!
Not a problem. Even though we don't expect many transactions out here in the sticks for quite some time. It can't hurt to be a early adopter as a merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:37:08
For sure. our hours are 11am-9pm except on Sundays
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:35:32
It's a great town. You won't be sorry! See ya this spring
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:37:52
Yeah we've talked about it for the past month or two. We figured the same. No harm in being an early adopter. While the price may be wildly fluctuating due to the recent media hype we have faith in the future of the currency. 
Thanks though. And now you know where to come if ya do!
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:10:48
Yep. Thanks for the tip. I had no idea it existed until responding to these comments.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:09:32
Oh wow! Thanks for the tip, RenSylvain! Much appreciated. We'll get us up on that map ASAP.
And hopefully our shop will be only one of many in the future! So if momentum keeps going I would guess pizza for Bitcoin in your area would definately be a possibility!
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:39:01
Hmm 25 downvotes? Why all the haters?
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:34:26
Awesome. Can't wait to see ya!
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:57:59
I'd say yes, but you'd have to sign a waiver before consuming!
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:59:14
Maybe we can arrange something involving drones. In the flavour of Amazon delivery. Bush/Obama-style: Not so much.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:41:19
Awesome! Yes, come on down. We'd appreciate the support, sincerely. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:33:39
We planned to just convert USD at the market rate. Our prices to bitcoin on the spot.
@_date: 2013-12-11 10:02:24
Not such a good idea to accept Bitcoin? Why's that?
