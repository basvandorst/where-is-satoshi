Are you really a journalist? Or are you 16-year-old taking a journalism class? Because a real journalist would know better than to use Reddit comments and their level of popularity as a source.

Maybe that's the case for freelance work.  My father made a very successful living doing what I mentioned, but he was a salesman not a producer, which might be the reason it worked so beautifully.  I remember once he actually had a Japanese client fly to Canada just to see his warehouse, so he rented out a warehouse and stuffed it with his product and paid a few guys to seem busy - he made a $500,000 sale that day and it was pretty hilarious.

Just some general business advice:
Your website should be less about promoting "Lee" (which I imagine is yourself) and more about promoting your business.  Change all the "contact lee now" to "contact us", all the "I"s to "we" and the "me"s to "us"; just generally refer to your business as a business rather than a dude which gives the impression you're just some guy in a basement with 
website design skills.  You have one giant testimonial taking up a huge amount of front page space and it's specific to you rather than your company, which again reinforces the idea that you're just some dude.
My dad spent his whole life successfully running businesses solo, and his advice to me was always give the impression that you're bigger than you really are.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:48:49
That's a fair point.  I don't know the web design business well enough to comment specifically, but you could very well be correct.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:24:33
If that's the case, and you yourself are a main selling point to prospective clients, you could consider re-tooling as though you were a real agency who happens to have "Lee SurnameHere" as our recent hire - e.g. "Wallis Creative, introducing our latest team member Lee who's reknown for his work on... etc."
Just a thought - wish you all the best with your endeavour!

Gold is only considered a "safe haven asset" because people believe it is. I personally wouldn't put a dollar of mine into it for the same reasons I stated.
You are correct that a price won't remain stable if money is coming into it, but someone looking for safety and stability would obviously rather that money to be at a trickle to increase its value consistently over a long period of time. I'd be much happier knowing BTC was returning a consistent 6-10% yearly return than seeing it jump up in price by 40% over a few weeks.
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:47:51
You know that crazy volatility on something you want to be used as a currency isn't a good thing right? You should be rooting for a steady climb rather than giant price spikes, unless you're simply using BTC as a high risk investment.

Which unfortunately points out an inherent flaw in the current bitcoin system.  On a stock exchange for example, you can trust your bank (or broker) to hold your cash for you, allowing for a proper exchange.  With bitcoin your exchange is a third party that gives no guarantees or protection that they won't embezzle your money or get hacked tomorrow.
