I don’t see how anyone can be an “expert” seeing this sector is in its infancy. And the brokerages I use just offered futures contracts 2 days ago so would be impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:35:34
You know it’s the peak when it is “the peak” it’s descent is when to sell and greed makes it hard to. Anyone could have caught it before it hovered around 16.5

My apologies for getting worked up, I agree with you on that one ����
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:17:15
Your discounting the other historical bubbles 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:53
You literally made the smart $ profit. This is a once in a lifetime experience. There are going to be a lot of disappointed people out there because making money is not this easy and this sector is now mainstream being covered by wall streets best and brightest.

Ok that is more like it , thank you I appreciate the info, makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:19:44
Yes smart ass , typically a dime more which equates to about 3 to 4 percent, I’m talking a 8 to 9 percent difference and it’s much more than filling my Jeep , fees and spread are important and add up.

If you were on any sub but this one I would assume sarcasm ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:18
None, I’m not an expert in this sector by any means, I think the exchanges will improve in time , I’m not trying to bash one exchange in particular I’m just curious why no one is talking about this

Kraken was almost 800 less yesterday than Coinbase, if this turns out to be tulips the only one who will be sitting pretty is Gdax/Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:41
Your Christmas gift was anywhere above 18 , wtf are you guys doing??? Bubbles are not an everyday opportunity, I’ve witnessed 3 in 20 years. This is diving closer to the capitulation stage everyday 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:54:21
Every body is taking profit or cutting losses now depending on their entry point , I’m interested in 10k ...  panic selling / stop loss, or buy trigger? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:04:54
Very good point, there are tons waiting in the wings for verification yet salivating- there will be lots of peaks and valleys but in the end it will crash
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:23:43
I’d love to read it do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:21:24
It’s hard to understand why the noobs continue to use it, I mean cmon it sways the market, a lot - I didn’t finish... was going to say Coinbase will be the reason we get regulated ASAP 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:20:10
New guys are on coin base getting butt raped with the joke spread 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:17:50
It’s closer to 98% , Mr. Foresight. Lots of tells for a top actually but after a peak like that you know it’s in decline. I still believe that a slow verification process to purchase BTC is the reason for the inconsistent trend down. Maybe I’m wrong and it never drops to a price I’m comfortable buying more at. I like the MySpace/ Facebook analogy best, I don’t know which one BTC ends up being, both?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:32:58
It’s not a cult it’s a currency. I hold BTC as well because I believe in the idea of it. but I still sold 75% of mine in hopes to buy back cheaper, 5K range is acceptable for me personally, I just don’t understand not selling after the peak. Please post a chart of any SOMEWHAT LIQUID asset that spiked as abruptly as this one with so much press then trended downward slowly and surged past its former peak.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:45:03
Then you knew it was a bubble as I did and tried to ride the wave up and succeeded. You should have taken profit a long time ago 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:56:16
Now a millionaire, tomorrow a thousandaire 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:17
Very well said! The arrogance of this sub is starting to annoy me, “it dropped 30 % , good I’ll buy more “ . Anyone who had the foresight to buy in before the 1K mark and didn’t take profits at 20k descending !? Wtf !? it’s baffling to me that you can be so smart yet so dumb at the same time and they are in for a rude awakening when this market matures because they will NEVER see easy money like that again
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:56:51
Why not both
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:51:24
Somewhat new, but the cult aspect is a double edged sword, while propping up the coins price at the same you can’t attach emotion to any asset 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:13
This is not the same by any means, I mean major bubbles like dot com and real estate and now this , no way you’ve seen a asset spike like this into the 20k range with the general public dumping money into something they can’t explain 5x because you haven’t, it’s a textbook bubble and the chart looks exactly like every other bubble. Mass adoption is happening right now In the early stages so there is still money to be made for years ... not in bitcoin unless you daytrade.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:53:55
How so, other than the verification info?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:15:16
You always sell after a monumental surge has peaked and is descending. Most on this sub are believers in a +20k coin so why not sell at 19 buy back at 11 12 or 13 and repeat?
