Right on dude! That's pretty awesome! I'll definitely keep this ear marked then. Lol. :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:17:25
I'm poor, otherwise I'd be tempted. Lol. :)

I'm sure someone would pay a bit of coin for prints of that. Well done. :)

My uncle said it was a scam as well when I mentioned it the other day. Said the shop he works for had a contract for some people making bitcoin atms. He said his boss dropped the customer as a client after they found out what the work was for. I thought that was a bit of an over the top reaction.
I told him the small amount I was able to invest is already double what I put in. He just kind of rolled his eyes. :/

I'm just curious, are you able to write off the bitcoin donations on your taxes? 25 bitcoins is a pretty large chuck of change.
Also, I think this is a really nice idea! :)

Cool. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:08:03
I'm not even mad...

I, too, would like to enter this giveaway! :D

Absolutely! The "gubmint" sees a lot of money they're not making and want their share (on both narcotics and bitcoin). Also, I'm not sure if you mean loose tobacco cigarettes or weed cigarettes. Lol. 
Either way though, when the government makes something legal, that previously was not, it doesn't automagically become cheaper. If anything it just gets a lot more red tape.

I can't really deny that there isn't tax revenue in that industry, because there is. But what's more exciting about it, to me at least, is the medical research that can be done a lot easier now.
With bitcoin, however, I don't get why they feel the need to control it (I mean, I get the whole its money thing, but really?).

The only part of that I disagree with is that prices of drugs decreasing if they're legalized. Look at the states where recreational weed is legal. Black market prices are still lower than going to a dispensary. The reason people will buy from dispensaries is because there's less harassment there than going through a black market source.

I'd rather pull it out sooner rather than later. Like you said, it costs electricity and that price is only going to go up the longer I let it run. 
I thought it was a pretty cool idea and wanted to try it.

 Nice! :)

The faster I get this paid off, the more money I'll be able to invest later on. It frees up a decent chunk of income each month. I can put some of that back into bitcoin and some of it save and buy another goal. :)

Can the community pool together to donate some bitcoins for him to get a new prosthetic nut? I mean he sacrificed a ball for bitcoin, we can sacrifice a few satoshis for one testicle.

One question. You said don't buy a hardware wallet from Amazon. The Trezor is on Amazon. It's it ok to buy Trezor from Amazon or should it always be bought through the manufacturer l?

These are really interesting times and I love watching them happen.
I remember when the internet was in its infancy and the proverbial "dot com" businesses were popping up. People seemed questionable about it but it ended up making a lot of people a lot of money on something that wasn't tangible. It was a crazy ride.
Now something similar is happening with a non-tangible currency and it's making a bunch of people a bunch of money again. It's so much fun to watch it happen. :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:28:52
I gotcha. I'm not really concerned about trying to chase anything. More like money I can afford to invest (nothing of major consequence would happen if I lost everything).
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:10:30
We broke 5000 both ways in a month!
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:01:02
 Gotcha. Thank you! :)

They're usually pretty consistent that the transactions happen in exactly one week.

I keep running across the term FUD; could someone please fill me in on what that means? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:47:06
Maybe if you get a 10$ wrench the robbers with the 5$ wrench will be too intimidated to take your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:48:43
Sweet ace! :D
