be patient.  They're smaller and likely very tied up.  Lots going on right now.  I have Gemini and I absolutely love it. 
don't give up.

Everyone I talk to who is new to crypto only knows about Bitcoin.  I haven't heard a single newbie ask about Bcash.  which is a clear indication that Bcash sucks and will continue to suck.  There is no war.  Bcash is dead and bitcoin won immediately after the fork.  quit talking about it and treat it as old news and it will be.

Where are you seeing this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:11
but what kind of thing could compromise the security of your mobile wallet?  only if someone steals your phone and enter the pin number can they access your coins.  I don't believe your private key can even be "hacked" if your coins are store on breadwallet.  It seems like breadwallet turns your phone into a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:09:46
yea, but *you* said it...
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:03:35
just quit using coinbase....
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:15:18
send update plz
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:43:08
if you were a holder, you'd give a shit.  start holding for know and don't worry about everyone else.  It's one thing to ask questions and offer suggestions, but it's entirely different to complain and undermine BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:03:48
Schedule D.  If you cash out within a year of your initial investment, you pay short term capital gains taxes.  Look at the table to see how much you'll be paying:
Don't cash out.  Hold.

TIL anyone talking trash or spreading negativity about BTC is a spy.  At least that's what i'm sticking with.  If you can't handle BTC, gtfo, we don't want you here spreading your useless complaints and ill-hearted sentiments.

ok thanks for the info.  pretty simple, this is exactly what I needed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:24:58
meanwhile people talk about Ethereum in a bitcoin forum....as if anyone gives a shit about ethereum...oh wait, all those people are in a *different* forum
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:24
can someone explain to me why the sell price can change for some people?  like why would anyone sell higher/lower than the market value?  On gemini, when I buy, I just buy at market value or i set a limit buy in case it goes lower...I don't really understand gdax or bittrex..
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:26:39
what dip ?  can we come up with a proper metric for determining real dips?  I say, it's not a real 'dip' unless it's at *least* a 25% drop
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:27
Please explain the benefit of using a hardware wallet vs. a mobile wallet like mycelium or Bread.  Excluding the potential to have phone stolen or lost...some mobile wallets like coinbase and blockchain store your private keys, however Bread and mycelium are very secure.  Are your funds just as vulnerable on a mobile wallet as an exchange?  Can you rank security?
1. Hardware
2. paper wallet
3. mobile wallet
4. exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:41:09
IIRC, your USD wallet is FDIC insured. If your BTC is stolen you're ~~outta luck.~~ SOL.

that would be great news for real hodlers.  the only people scattering like roaches weren't meant to hodl in the first place.

only if he cashes out...if he's trading up from coin-to-coin, those are like-kind exchanges.  no capital gains unless he cashes out or uses the BTC to make a purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:34:14
I thought the button says "Submit text *NOT* about price"...so how come people are still doing it?  We all know what the price is....why do people keep doing this ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:46:28
I have only good things to say about Gemini.  Your first 30 withdrawals are fee-free.  Yes, they have been down a few times, but they recover quickly and my funds are safe and sound.  I buy all my btc on Gemini, and when i hit a certain amount, I withdraw into my wallet.  Haven't had a single issue.
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:50:56
step 1:  get out of your fraternity
step 2: spend fraternity money on btc
step 3: hodl
step 4: look at your btc while you're on your death bed and realize the price still hasn't hit 100k
step 5: ask yourself if it was worth it
step 6: die
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:19:19
enjoy having the IRS come after you for all the things you buy with BTC..because those are ALL taxable events.  Sure if no one reports it, you ca probably get by, but if you're seriously doing this for 100% of your life, the IRS will find out.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:15:04
that's probably the most accurate statement so far
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:46:46
but the feeeeeessss
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:47:01
unless there's some piece of news i'm missing, there is no indication that bitcoin prices will go up anytime soon.  there is plenty of bitcoin to go around so there's really no rush to buy at all
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:14:25
only when whales buy the dips would the price go up....but a few thousand, or even tens of thousands of people buying fractions of BTC in the dip won't make a dent
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:01:47
I’ll do this!! I will be available around 8pm cst
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:22:55
this saddens me so much.  does anyone know if there's a way to see what he's up to and how he's doing?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:06:54
I don't really understand this...I thought the segwit2x fork failed.  Also, I didn't see anything about blockchain wallet.  Should I just switch from blockchain to bread wallet ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:04
I don't recall seeing this on a 1040 form...where is this information supposed to go ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:10:16
just because 100,000 people made accounts on coinbase doesn't mean 100,000 people invested in btc...this particular spike will drop in a couple days.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:11
let me know if you add that information in your document. I'd love to learn a little more :) 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:45:24
and this is not the case with a wallet like bread?  if i transfer my BTC into a hardware wallet from blockchain, do i still run the risk of losing my btc ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:23
assume i'm holding for &gt; year
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:57:00
yeah great resource.  maybe include some more information about mobile wallets/security vs hardware vs paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:38
I agree, but as long as I my life can be ruined by the gov't because of tax fraud, i will pay my taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:27
from what i understand, unless you're paid in btc or you're a miner, you don't claim gains on btc as income.  it's a property and you pay capitol gains on capitol assets.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:40:42
you know, Leo decaprio is a pretty handsome man.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:43:12
yes. capitol gains.  you must pay taxes on your earnings.  but only once you've cashed out or even spent those  btc
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:57
are the exchanges such as gemini, bittrex liable for sending you 1099's though?  
I've had other exchanges 1099 me for stocks.  not sure if it's the same in cryptocurrencies.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:13:50
So i guess my main concern is whether or not blockchain wallet is ok to use?  Excluding someone hacking my account or stealing my phone, need I worry about my BTC vanishing on my blockchain wallet ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:01:21
well i don't have very much at the moment, but i buy a little bit every week.  i will be spending as needed, but saving as well.  do you think keeping it in blockchain wallet is totally stupid?  aside from the obvious aspect that hardware wallet is always more secure.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:34:58
elaborate why please...so far i've really liked it.  easy to manage sending and receiving btc
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:38:54
breadwallet is dope.  i quit using blockchain and shifted to breadwallet.  interface isn't as nice as blockchain, but security-wise, it's better.  assuming you don't lose your phone, you should be fine leaving good amounts of btc in there.  although the ledger is always better
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:15:28
you can buy a cheaper rolex for only 5k...even less in some places.  hell, i could get a fake rolex for $300 and convince lots of people of whatever....i don't have a point here.  except that a rolex means nothing

don't be a jerk.  some dads are drug addicts...like my dad :( 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:20
for sure, but what I don't understand is that every transaction can be traced, so how do you ever really avoid being noticed?  
Or is it just that the likelihood of being audited by the IRS for BTC is really low unless the amount in super big?
Even If i gave some BTC via localbitcoin, anybody can still trace that all the way back to my private wallet right ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:02
you still need to pay taxes on your earnings even if you buy things with BTC...
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:49:33
can you speak to the advantages/disadvantages of using coinbase over gemini ?  I am new to bitcoin and so far i purchased only a small amount through gemini
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:00
okay, so if i pay someone from my ledger nano, the only way they could know it was me is by some how finding how that the ledger was mine in the first place?
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:50:58
then don't partake in the conversation.
