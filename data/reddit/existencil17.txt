No you'll just lose all your money 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:46:29
50k by Valentine's Day?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:51
A scapegoat for bad investment decisions. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:49:30
People are allowed to make their own financial decisions? The world isn't obligated to buy into a speculative bubble so you can turn a profit? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:27
Do you guys think it will be worth 25k by 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:28:11
The current price is inflated by demand from impatient investors looking for massive returns day in day out. When bitcoin stabilized a little this week, money flowed into other cryptos. It all the cryptos return modest or even slow growth be wary, bored investors may leave traditional cryptos entirely. The current price is not supported by ANY intrinsic value beyond the value of mining a bitcoin in energy and resources. There is no reason to think it can't go to $25,000 and no reason to think it can't fall back below $10,000.

They've been doubling every few months or so. There's limited miner bandwidth to process so many transactions. Problem will get worse before it gets better. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:26
25k by Christmas?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:58:57
Yessir 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:36:55
No currency this volatile will be accepted as a medium of exchange. Steam just stopped accepting it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:47
So you're down $25... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:39:02
Why wouldn't you sell and then buy a shit ton more at 10k
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:29:07
It should be 25k by Christmas 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:22
Except their demand is the reason the price is as high as it is now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:25
To reach that level required demand from tens of thousands of small time, late-adopting investors getting absolutely fucked right now. Odds they just jump back in and forget this little misfortune seem slim to me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:46:52
Imagine what would happen in the case of a real correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:52
Why would somebody not sell if they think it's tanking? To protect the HODLers from volatility?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:39:16
And there she goes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:07
You losing a lot of money? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:30:49
Amen 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:05:36
Your post didn't have "HODL" or some bullshit about a coordinated FUD-whale conspiracy against small time bitcoin traders in it so nobody responded. Funny given how many people here castigate others for "not understanding the technology." 
As to your post I agree completely, expanding the blocksize warrants discussion sooner rather than later. Throwing this link out there for people who want to learn a little more about what they're investing in. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:07
Pretty awful if you consider the hype, litany of articles, and analysis that accompanied the run up to bitcoin futures. Nobody in their right mind would speculate on derivatives of such a volatile security. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:44
Yeah that was a little bit of poorly executed sarcasm my bad haha 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:09
So you can make $10? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:51
And yet the calling card of crypto is its decentralization 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:14
Most people in this sub will make $10 on their $40 holdings. Rich! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:39:48
Any idea what the reasoning/psychology is behind that pattern?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:38
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:22:17
The last thing people should do is rely on a risky investment to turn their life around. Also newsflash, spanking the monkey every now and then is healthy, using it as a scapegoat for your problems will just distract you from addressing the real sources of your perceived stagnation in life.
This is an investment, plain and simple. This is not a "movement" or a "revolution." People that get hung up on some bullshit idea of a crypto community will get absolutely fucked if that prevents them from making decisions in the best interest of themselves and their families. Stay woke.

In the last 48 hours, $200 billion has been erased from the cryptocurrency market capitalization. Staggering figure to take in. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:46
For people that put in money at 19k this is tough to stomach I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:08:04
Man these investors really have A LOT of Christmas shopping to do! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:02
I've actually done that with stocks I thought had good fundamental value that were manipulated as shit and I ended up losing piles. Be careful, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:37:32
Surest sign of a bubble is people criticizing someone who locked in his gains to pay of his mortgage. Like cmon, the man rode the speculative bubble and came out on top. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:18:47
Exactly, people don't see that most of bitcoin's value is in demand driven by hype. As more and more people looking to get rich quick pull out after a disappointing few weeks, the more this will fall and the more long-term investors will panic and leave. 
People here like to call people that sell weak-willed, but that's human nature, we're all risk averse to some degree. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:22:23
The futures market, which is as close a gauge of investor sentiment as we have right now, only anticipates bitcoin rising to $17230 by mid march. There could be surprises, of course, but there also is likely less room for explosive growth than there was just a few months ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:14
I think the aspect of this subreddit that will make it of particular interest potentially is the use of memes and esoteric jargon to create a false sense of community and security. It is, after all, the first bubble fueled, in part, by the modern internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:39:06
It's more than the media. It's countless major investors, economists, and federal governments. Warren Buffet, Stephen Roach, Janet Yellen, etc. This sub is getting more and more fringe. Crap like 'FUD' and 'normies' is a reaction to being told by several people with vastly more economic acumen suggesting bitcoin's growth isn't sustainable. This 'they don't understand the technology' bullshit is a dangerous mentality. Major investment banks and governments hire experts in all fields, including cryptos, to help them make informed decisions. Hence why more and more governments are trying to regulate the market before a correction fucks up their citizens and destabilizes their domestic economies. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:39
For real 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:29
Logically that HAS to be what's going on 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:46
Are you telling me 
1. they have so much bitcoin invested that they have NO cash to buy gifts with 
And 
2. They waited until the 22nd to start the arduous process of cashing out? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:04
You can't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:31
$25,000 by New Years?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:24:26
All the bitcoin derivatives currently available are cash-settled, meaning they don't directly effect the value of bitcoin on exchanges like GDAX or Gemini. You're just seeing volatility. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:31:13
Anybody got a link to live CBOE btc futures prices?
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:54:53
China is attempting to restrict trade for a variety of reasons and is a good example of government regulation.
First and foremost, the country relies on capital controls to prevent its citizens from funneling their wealth out of the country and destabilizing their controlled and centralized fiat currency. This is where I would agree that their primary motivation is controlling their citizens with an iron fist.
It is also the case, however, that a sharp correction in the bitcoin market would ruin the lives of countless Chinese citizens. That is the kind of economic destabilization that undermines Communist Party rule and cannot be tolerated.
Even if the rationale is primarily based in a desire to maintain control, it is predicated in fears of what might happen if the bubble pops. The Chinese don't make decisions without careful consideration and likely decided that the market was not resting on a solid foundation.

Some much needed perspective in a sub that vilifies anything but HODLing.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:06:25
Why would it? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:41:48
Or bitcoin was overvalued.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:19:50
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:02:43
I understand and agree with this sentiment completely, coverage should be more fair and balanced. I have two primary qualms.
1. There are experts whose opinions and experience should be valued by people with no background in finance or economics.
2. There is a general aversion in this sub to honest discussion of the fact you make clear yourself: this is extremely speculative and not necessarily destined for the moon. 
There are a lot of inexperienced investors that really should be reminded regularly that this is no place to put anything but money they're willing to lose.
