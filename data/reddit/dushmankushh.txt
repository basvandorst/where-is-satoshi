It's likely going to be down another 50% or so from here. It is ridiculously costly to support miners at this level considering BTC has next to no utility besides speculation at this point.

These figures are absolutely peanuts. 10 years later and were talking about transaction in UsD terms that a kid with a lemonade stand might optimistically achieve. 
Pathetic

Y'all been saying this nonsense since like 17k. Every drop is bait. Lmao

Come December 25 when you are proven horribly wrong, how will you answer for this shameless hopium post you charlatan?

Store value LOLOLOL down 50% in 2 weeks. Cope harder.

Get the fuck out of Nunavut if you don't know anyone that's heard of bitcoin.

Your account is a month old. Stop pretending you were here in 2015 or that my sentiment reflects the sentiment of the bagholders. You see the downvotes? Each one represents another 10% BTC has to go before it hits bottom.

Fuck no. I do trade BTC but on high leverage and will long when I think it's going up. Only a fool would put fiat into this hot garbage of a failed project. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:08:23
Price is only down 50% in 20 days. Crisis averted. ��

Gold will probably go up in a recession. No reason to believe BTC will. This is simply your unfounded hope. There is no evidence at all to suggest BTC will act as a safe haven when people are struggling to feed their families. 
In fact, BTC will likely hit triple digits or even double digits in a global severe recession as it is purely a speculative asset with suspect intrinsic value (if it has any at all). 
Capitulation is next.

You can long on bitmex.

Good on you for not selling the top. I admire your poor decision making and commend your heroism. 
Please continue to act so foolishly in the future for the good of humanity. Salute.

Isn't it obvious? He's going off on wild tangents to cope with the fact that crypto is imploding and hodlers are losing money faster than corrupt third world governments. 
Muh financial system isn't fair, better speculate on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:29:21
Nobody is defending unbacked govt fiat buddy. BTC has to be judged on its own merit and in that regard it is a spectacular failure. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:21:30
Gonna be a cold winter 2018 boyo. Strap in. 1xxx is an optimistic bottom. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:06:47
Yeah man get it off exchanges. Don't let the big bad bears use your coins to short muh store of falling value. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:27:22
Yes get more upset. This is going sub 1000 and there's nothing you can do about it. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:42:24
You will capitulate and sell below 2000 to protect profits.
It is destiny. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:05:38
I have BTC. It's going sub 1000 and will likely never hit new all time highs. 
Deal with it. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:23:37
Because it has no intrinsic value beyond speculation and the speculators are broke after having gotten in after it went mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:40:22
For the love of God, would you stop fucking pretending you're an early adopter? If you're so sure about Bitcoin stop fucking being ashamed of having bought near the top in 2017 and being underwater. 
Man up and embrace your circumstances with honor instead of going around lying constantly like a coward.
