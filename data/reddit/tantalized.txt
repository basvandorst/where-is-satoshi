I like what he did there too.

Wait... what. What?

I think we're all in concurance, we just need to get the people organized.

Yah man, cause now nobody can get illegal drugs... Wait silk road wasn't even that popular, and let's remember darkest deals are extremely violent!

It's been a good year for hitmen.

But what it does do is allow people who don't have a wallet create one to collect their bit tips. And once they have a couple bits maybe they will buy a few bits more to purchase something of higher value. Like when I was a kid a chucky-cheese I'd save a couple tickets, but it still wasn't enough for the sticky frog, so my daddy would buy me the remaining tickets.

And lack of education is a major hindrance.

I agree, i think it will drop off after christmas.

I don't understand this "fraud detection" I have been wit coin base for a while and it works like a whale oiled mechashark. But I have heard this a bit.

What is Ripple??

Can confirm. I had a whole batch and now I'm stuck with only lefts.

There is Ubuntu for Android, it's pretty much linux.

A little bit failed. I don't see how "Samsung galaxy my bank game me" is super relevant. But I would say just try a few apps, there isn't really one perfect app. I use Coinbank, I think it has the most fair commissions. But I haven't tried the vender app, so I cannot attest to that.
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:44:56
Explain, is it not realistic?
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:40:02
Idk man, I would like to see the Bitcoin evolve by its self, without the influence of PayPal or any other money management device. The only crossover I would like to see is making it easier for people to buy Bitcoins.

Holly shit that was crazy informative. I've never heard of the %51 percent attack and this literally answered all my questions.

I would love to be involved in this, it sounds pretty dope.

I've seen people run it through a tablet, but I'm not sure the legality, or anything like that.
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:18:29
I actually really do like the terminology, it really reinforces the digital currency aspect for me.
@_date: 2014-11-03 06:35:25
Explain how that would work, no inflation from the start? Wouldn't nobody own the coin, or they would have to buy and sell a coin instantaneously.
@_date: 2014-11-03 06:43:00
Curious about this as well.
@_date: 2014-11-16 05:21:22
Many thanks, I wish I knew how to use change tip, I would throw you some bit. If you want to pm me an address I would happily tip you. If I figure tipping it out I'll come back!

I fucking love bitburger... I've even got a few mugs from there!
FYI they do not accept bitcoin .

@_date: 2014-11-02 09:13:06
That's actually a very valid statement.
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:34:25
Yes, banks use that money for investments that far outweigh their fees. Therefore its highly lucrative to tell someone "hell yeah well take your money, and not charge you a dime!"

It's cause you said no not really then threw out a random statistic, and your parent isn't doing too hot either. BaurusdB made it short and sweet, but I can throw an up vote your way!
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:43:16
It was a he'll of an article, that didn't really state anything clearly. Yah I get it, people who were supposed to turn down bad investments didn't because their boss made them redo their reports until it said they were sounds investments. But a hit that could have been said in 3 short concise paragraphs. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:39:30
Would you recommend this based on fees paid?

Curious if anyone uses My Trezor to send money, or should I use mycelium instead? I noticed that my last transaction of .45btc had a fee for .03btc ( per btc). It ended up charging .017, but still.. Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:29:37
I've always liked coinbase, they do have fees, but they dont seem too high to me. They do have instant transfer too, it takes like 20 sec for them to show up, but it does require a card on file incase your bank declines your primare payment option. I'd be curious what other companies charge too.   
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:39:01
Are you familiar to how it males vulnerabilities? I don't use paper, just Trezor, but I would be curious for possibly transferring to friends via paper
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:20:31
I bought mine on Amazon necause I have prime. The box was sealed and when I plugged it in and verified it's kernal. I forget how maybe hold both buttons when you plug it in, but it's all in the instructions. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:47:50
So how do you manage inputs... Just read about it, or it's easy enough to explain? And will different wallets send more or less inputs?
I bought my trezor a while back, but I've only used it for storage. I use coinbase for spending and selling btc. Until recently I had to make a payment, and my credit card expired and I couldnt use instant buy with coinbase. I've just never seen huge fees from coin base. As much as I dont like my money in others hands if I can save a couple bucks a week it seems like it's more compelling although I did fix instant buy. I had hoped trezor could be my end game for spending.     
Edit: Minor text fix
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:12:13
Is it me?
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:02:18
This is exactly what i use coinbase for, short term transactions, and purchasing bitcoin. I use my trezor as a bank, where the vast majority of my coin is held.
@_date: 2016-12-06 07:33:53
Just out of curiosity what other data can/is being stored in the block chain?
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:51:19
So trezor doesnt allow me to set the fees, or inputs. I guess I didn't realize you could have multiple inputs via a single transaction. You never cease to amaze me Bitcoin. Should I use a different wallet to send then, or am I just doing it wonky?
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:59:30
I was always under the impression that not changing address will create a vulnerability for people to take your coin. But I really don't know..

That's actually pretty practical. I wonder what the heat to watt offset is, including the price of mining profit. How many miners would it take to heat a family house, and would it go as far as even connecting them to a central heating duct, or would you have to have a miner in each and every room. I'd assume it would be much more efficient to run 220v to one central area, and the duct the heat to each room. In the summer you could just send this heat away from the house. Very interesting idea.
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:20:26
Thank you, that was a great article. A little over my head but It did clear up my main question, what is an input and how are they selected. Are there any wallets they will show you how many inputs you will be sending before you set your fee price? Just out of curiosity what wallets/hardware do you use?
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:55:18
I think that would be a more valid post if it were in $$ because the last million people buying 1 btc would be paying an outrageous number. Say all those 16million buy $200 worth that's 3.2b and the current market cap is 14b which means a purchase of ~1/4 of the current cap. Prices would go up. But to put this in perspective $200 is 1/3rd of the average annual median per capita income in india.    
Edit: The part about annual income is based on a 2013 consensus, but I'm sure it's a little higher by now.

Just out of curiosity why do you mix them? (I'm assuming mixing and blending are the same thing) Are you paying for anonymity?
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:21:56
How did you calculate that 2t?
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:56:54
860! Hopefully it can climb!
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:50:31
I dont think this (point 3) is true.. at least in America. Small miners may have a lower cost to maintenance, but companies pay about 25% of the cost for electricity that civilians do. Places like Greenland that use geothermal to power rigs, and have basically no cost to cooling have increadible potential, but this really doesn't effect small miners.
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:39:47
Mmm I see, I guess the point is the wallet has done the most optimal work, but it would still be nice to be able to round the transaction up or down (only send full utxo's) to minimize fees. But I guess that would only be beneficial for transferring to yourself.
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:03:56
I'm still confused about the whole inputs thing... So you purchase from mycelium, or by consolidate you mean mining rewards? Then when you get a good chunk you send it to your hardware wallet. And by sending 1 larger amount to your hardware it consolidates that into 1 input..? 
So when I look at my transfer being verified and there are multiple addresses then I jave sent multiple outputs, or those are just the address that is verifying? Also feel free to tell me to google it, I'm just not sure what exactly to even search for.
@_date: 2016-12-24 07:15:16
But like, do I have to wait 45 min for that to go through..?
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:49:10
Do they track them, or do they just flag memos? I've never heard of them tracking coins but I would not out it past them, I really do not trust their motives haha 
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:47:18
Either way theres going to be fireworks
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:53:36
Oh year this makes a lot of sense, thank you
