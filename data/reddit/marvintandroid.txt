Gifts under $14k are tax free in US. Regardless this is a wonderful gesture and the kind of response and behavior that contributed to me feeling so passionate about the BTC community.

Wondering if 'annual transactions over $20k" is based on the dollar amount invested or the value of the bitcoin? If it's the value of the Bitcoin, is it the value of the BTC at time of purchase, at end of year, etc? Don't see myself in the mix either way just trying to better understand the settlement.

Interesting flashback to an interview that took place 12/11/2013,  the day before Andreessen invested $25mil in Coinbase. He tells a few amusing stories, prognosticates a bit and completely geeks out. I'm guessing that Mayer doesn't get the Star Trek reference. Naturally the question from the audience is about... BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:57:31
OK, so due to a host of factors (media representation, developing technology, dishonest brokers {Gox}, etc) the majority of individuals are not asking for BTC presently - are they asking for Western Union and pleased with the service for fee model they present? Are they asking for the existing banking model? Heck, why I am even justifying this gentleman's comment with a response - I'm out.

Meanwhile we just busted 410 on a string of sizeable purchases - apparently fear of the news of possible sale from a theorized Satoshi in 2020 is not an issue now and doubtful it will be at that time, as a whole lot can transpire in 4 years folks.

Agreed but I'm guessing that they understood that Gizmodo or possibly other outlet was working same story and they chose high profile/economic scoop with their being tech based as cover for potentially exposing SM. Additionally, based on the article it seems Prof Wright was dangling clues and dropping crumbs - by Wired's account, seemingly taunting them to discover him.

Ugh, overly simplistic, misrepresentation and perpetuation of myths - "bitcoin is a currency" - no mention of blockchain, "bitcoin is a currency that isn't controlled by government at all" - huh?!, "in America you see people using BTC on a black market" - no mention of the myriad legitamate purchase you can make, etc. Oh well, what did I expect from Stossel, Fox &amp; mainstream TV?!

Add a bit of Trump/dollar uncertainty, stir in a pinch of India demonetisation, and a smidge of the same from Venezuela. A healthy dollop of Brasil in turmoil - for that matter, the whole darn world is spinning and BTC is starting to look secure. [It's time...](

Of minor note, I saw a 1 min news segment on Al Jazeera America yesterday where they question/promote BTC's value in Greece. Reasonably well done except they once again offered no numbers just more empty hyperbole about how it is 'gaining in recognition and could be behind the rise in price.'
Was not able to find the segment online though I did find [this brief article]( which inexplicably has a stock shot of a BTC machine with no comment...?

So their return on 12 months looks to be about what an individual holding their own $1200 BTC investment, would make in... 12 months (based on the last 12 months). The thing is you can't rely on a 'return' on BTC, rather you can put money that you can afford to lose in, learn how to spend it on real world items, control it and potentially make money or trade out vs the idea of "investing" and not controlling your assets, not truly learning about BTC and spending and thereby building the ecosystem, etc. Hmmm - tough choice.

The first link is worth a look but the second one looks to be just an alternate type of an individual looking to get others to invest in their system while 'de-bunking' another's. Classic.

Sadly I'm guessing that if the post had been from PR or an intern then there would have been an angry backlash karping about how they sent some lackey to do their promotion and are not truly connected to the community. Sigh...

While I appreciate that we should be having 'serious discussions' on this forum I do appreciate a good laugh and I love this one. I'll never tire of hearing "It's over 9000!" so I am enjoying... while it's still in play.

Timing this action just before the Bitcoin Conference seems a bit suspicious... not that it might just be coincidence.

So he opens with something along the lines of ' I don't really know what the heck they look like or how to explain...'
Kudos mainstream media on another great guest explaining a concept that is not nearly as complex as you all wish it would be! I knew I could count on you once again for insightful and informative analysis of today's big news.

Good luck with the 'other countries falling into line' demand given all the good will and chummie feelings we are generating thanks to Mr Snowden (&amp; others) brave actions. I sincerely doubt that Germany or Brazil will even take that call given their recent statements and actions regarding the NSA and American foreign policy. Of course they are tied to the global economy but still they appear to be a bit more reasonable about regulating BTC.
Add to that China's long held desire to create an alternate currency basket to replace dollar preeminence as they are tired of buying our low interest loans that will never be repaid and finally, following the money we have...BTCChina - hmmm,
The US govt is really in a pickle and is likely scrambling to find some way to control BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-19 13:55:09
I find it interesting that after a cursory scan of major economic news outlets (Marketwatch, CNNMoney, CNBC, etc) I was not able to find one story related to the recent rise in BTC. Sure the shutdown shenanigans have kept most folks distracted but I would have expected some mention of the activity. No conspiracy theory, more likely they have taken their eye off the ball and moved on to more salacious stories - they will be back.

Does your Mum use paypal? Does she pay her bills online? I sympathize with your post as I am constantly getting calls from my folks asking for tech support but more along the lines of 'I forgot how to open my e-mail.'
Not certain a goal of making BTC friendly for ALL users is realistic or desirable at this phase. If we can just get... the kids to use it, of course their attention span is... what was I saying?

Excellent reply except that when the various thieves you describe steal your credit card, rob a bank, acquire credit card data, etc, in most cases you are covered from all loses with the exception of the cash in your wallet.
Yes, I understand that corporations/banks/government are taking our money but that is a deeper conversation and not relevant to average Joe's perception and skill set for BTC. The respondents who speak of how the advances we will see as .9 advances until BITCOIN 1.0 and make a more user friendly... product make a key point.
Of course, if those advances and more 'user friendly' layers are all good is yet again another thread...

After much discussion and explanation I have convinced my brother to accept bitcoin for beer making kit and supplies. He is starting small but will add items from his inventory upon request.
The store is legit as they own a brick and mortar brewshop and hardware store - he wants to start small but is offering a sale for folks who buy via the online store with bitcoin!
Stop by the store and show him I was not lying when I said that I was certain there would be some bitcoin enthusiasts who also brew beer.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:14:42
The dependency is a good thing in that it drives BTC to adapt and be... competitive. The critical advantage it has is that it can incorporate any new, valuable mods into the SHA-256 protocol. (Note - many of the 'competing' currencies are using as well) Add to this it's current market dominance and you have a tough protocol to beat. Regardless, if it is supplanted that's OK and I am highly skeptical that it would happen overnight vs an evolutionary transition. All good.

I posted a [comment]( about my plans to give BTC as a holiday gift and depending on what responses I do or do not hear you may want to consider my method...
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:46:43
I absolutely agree - my way of contributing to the growth of BTC is to not just offer to explain BTC to friends and family by explaining how it works and answering questions but I also take the time to set up a BTC wallet for them and donate a wee bit of BTC (more than a Satoshi). To me this not only gives them information but more importantly it encourages them to be active in promoting and following the development. Naturally in explaining I try to move beyond the complex issues of the blockchain and also include information about the disruptive power of BTC, include some humor like history of pizza index and origin of MTGox and finally show them all of the places they can spend their BTC and how they can encourage it's use locally.
Since I travel a fair bit, thanks to my work, I feel like a very tiny pied piper for BTC and the good news is a fair number of friends and family have followed up my visit with updates about their own BTC evangelism and also now are often sending me links to news items, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:44:38
Looking at my notes from interview - Marc said things like:
* We're making bets (investments) on companies that are going after bitcoin in different ways.
* He doesn't own BTC but sees as venture capital opportunity.
* Very early.
* You can't buy ads on Yahoo with bitcoin, hopefully soon. To which Mayer said something like - we'll work on it.
* It works because of network effect, same kind of effect as internet, web, ebay, etc. It will go up because more people accept, etc.
* Alluded to it being early but certain that cryptographic currency is a slam dunk.
THESE ARE NOT QUOTES!
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:26:09
I like the idea of a BTC commercial but we should focus on practical next steps and skip the SUPER BOWL nonsense. Not only is the price not worth the return but the ad buys are likely complete and getting this together in time given the collaborative approach would be a minor miracle.
That is not to say I do not believe in miracles, just prefer to dedicate energy to worthy miracles. Our passion and resources should be dedicated to organizing the skills we have, set a deadline and then take this discussion off Reddit to a collaborative platform where we can focus and discuss the script, placement and production process (where, when, who, etc). We can update this thread as we come up with a plan and continue to take input and then shoot it, do the post and submit.

Indeed - my sister and I are giving our five nieces and nephew paper wallets and a letter/e-mail that contains a variety of links with different degrees of info. Stuff like where to spend, how to be safe, history, link to white paper, blockchain, etc - from beginner to advanced.
I will show them the apps they can download, help them with two factor auth., etc. Worst case they put it in a drawer and keep for awhile - a few had expressed interest when I have brought them up so I anticipate a reasonably positive reception.

Internal only. Sorry. Eventually it will be available to Yahoo corporate and then I am guessing general audience.
