You don't understand what double-spending is or why solving it is such a huge breakthrough. The double-spending problem is the reason why there haven't been any digital cash systems before bitcoin. In the future you might want to read up on what you're talking about before you start talking.

Please explain how a blockchain without bitcoin/token is valuable.

Exactly, that was my point. Don't you realize that what you said in your first comment is basically agreeing with the point the inforgraphic is trying to make? I'm a pretty big believer in bitcoin's future potential. That doesn't mean that I believe that it's ready for mass adoption in it's current state. You need to realize that most bitcoin proponents aren't excited about it because of what it is right now (though I would argue that it's still amazing in it's current state), but because they can see it's future potential. I firmly believe that the lightning network will have as much of an impact on bitcoin's mainstream adoption as the web browser had on the mainstream adoption of the internet.
Also, apologies for being unnecessarily discourteous in my last comment. I reread your first comment and found nothing there that called for such impudent behavior from my side. I seem to have misjudged the tone of your comment.

How dense are you? That's exactly the point the infographic is trying to make. With every new invention it's necessary to straighten out the rough edges before it's ready to be adopted by the average consumer. Do you think the internet/lightbulb/car was for the average person the second it was invented?
