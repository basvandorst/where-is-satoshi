At least you might make your life better... Money can help you get funds to do go outside and enjoy yourself and get with a woman instead of being a slave to porn. Fuck porn lmao, it's a water of time and pathetic.

0% fee on buying with Limit buy and 0.25% for selling? Is that alot?? They also let you send your BTC off GDAX to your BTC address for no fee.

These kind of posts just show the mentality of some people..  its cringe-worthy.

This. That's the point of it. You can't control or silence its users. I don't agree with the "alt-right" but they should be able to say what they want - (only serves to make fools of themselves) - and they should be able to use their money how they want. People who read modern news are as bad as weak hands these days. News and titles like this are designed to make you mad. It's how they get your clicks and make money, it's outrage-culture.

Never bought a lottery ticket in my life. People at work love buying it and dream about "what they would do if they won" all the time. I always remind them they are more likely to get struck by lightning, twice. It's the biggest waste of money ever.

What the fuck
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:34:28
I know it can be seen as a bit deluded or something but anytime I've even thought of selling the thought that FIAT will be useless and a crypto will be the money we use in years to come always prevents me from selling. Aside from buying a house outright without a mortgage I would keep the rest in BTC.

Absolutely mad. Autism gender or something, what in gods name was I reading? I need bleach for my eyes. I regret this.

Now this is well thought out post. With all the adoption the transactions will be spread out and the block size won't be as much of an issue. But still, the issue of WHEN for the lightning network is the problem. A bad crash or anything with bitcoin could reduce confidence before the solution (lightning) is implemented.

Not to mention day trading requires work. It's more than a simple investment  or currency. You will be stressed.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:36:34
It reminds me of at work - people that dream of winning the lotto. They always say all the silly rediculous things they will buy. When they ask me I say I'll invest it to get passive income, and then probably live like I do now, with maybe a new electric car..
I think you have to realize money doesn't really make you happy after a certain point - I think being around great people, having great experiences, etc are what makes you happy. I can do that already, go to the odd concert, have a holiday. If anything I would just do more of that. Things definitely won't make me happy, I would never get a lambo, that's just dumb. Experiences, family, friends, that makes you happy... If you flaunt your wealth with a lambo etc, you will attract people that are not real friends.

Just use GDAX. man how are people this uneducated about their investments?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:06:08
Well if you are buying and selling on the same website (GDAX) then doesn't it not make a difference? Unless you plan on HODLing a long ass time and expect them to not be around anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:55:41
Best advice. Else you will have anxiety checking charts all day. I did this for a few months and it was like a stress fee investment.  Another tip is to learn technology, watch documentaries, read a Bitcoin for dummies book, etc. Also get your coins off the exchange if you are holding for a long period, into a wallet you control. COINBASE or gdax are like a bank, they own it at the minute.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:04:32
Well I bought 5K euro BTC at 4000$ so I bought the trezor that day.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:01:45
Same, dad is putting 10000 in since I made so much investing 5000
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:18:07
What this guy said. You are basically shooting yourself in the foot using Coinbase. It's funny because GDAX is owned by Coinbase and has no fees. They don't advertise it though, I assume with the intention that most one time buyers will use coinbase without knowing GDAX exists and give them the juicy fees, whilst GDAX is there to keep them competitive.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:44:01
Absolutely not. I would tell them to invest it if they are comfortable.
Make sure before ANY investment is done they read up on Bitcoin. Perhaps a Bitcoin for dummies book and a documentary like banking on Bitcoin. They need to understand it and make their own decisions so you are not held responsible.
I gave my parents my story with btc and the success and told them about it but no way did I tell them to invest or when to.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:18
It's 50$, jeeze, hold it. I have 5000 euros worth and I haven't even broke a sweat. This is basic stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:23:14
If you hold alot, for example I originally bought 5K euro worth and the Trezor was worth it (cost about 110 euro with shipping). Considering I'm already up 50% it was well worth it. 
It's very easy to use, spend, send it to coinbase to sell, etc. It's pretty noob-proof. But of course, do your own research, I watched a lot of videos and such to understand and choose the best one for me.

I increased my bitcoin holdings by like 0.02 by day trading once. It was 100000000% times more stressful than just HODLing. Not worth it. Gaining that 0.02 could have had me lose 0.20 instead. It's too risky. Unless you have THOROUGHLY educated yourself, don't even try.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:42:30
Does sound worrying. I earn about 23k euro a year but manage to save about 10k a year for savings/Bitcoin. I know it's not comparable but him and his wife combined are on about triple that. I fear they have a high value on material things for happiness which can lead to squander and unhappiness even with those monetary gains.
Anyway. I guess it all boils down to trust. If you can't fully trust her, then tell her about some, an amount like 25 or 50 and get rid of it and do something worth while with that.

It's 500000£ jeeze, hold it. I have 2,000,000$ worth that I remortgaged my house for and I haven't even broken a sweat. This is basic stuff!

Lightning should change things
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:20:34
Definitely. I was always a bit more of a saver as my parents were quite frugal but this has definitely made me more frugal. It's a good thing. It makes you think about what really makes you happy in life be it exercise etc than buying the next new thing to escape your real problems.

Yeah it makes no sense lol. You would want strong able people, food, water, shelter and solar power maybe?? Bitcoin would be fucked in a doomsday and most other currencies

Most people, social justice warriors ESPECIALLY that harp on about the injustices in the world would throw it all out the window as soon as they get a little power. It all stems from their unhappiness with themselves and even if they get the power they will probably be unhappy because as you come to realize the things that matter in life are usual real relationships with people, being healthy, and such and these people got lucky with money and still have no self control to pursue the things that make them happy.
Negative people who blame others and take no action to improve themselves are the worst to be around. WORST. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:58:11
Unless you work with a bunch of people that have never heard of a savings account they are more likely to be happy with you. I don't have this problem..
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:55:20
Yeah I think we are in a small bubble that will pop down to 3.5k and rise again but the chance of total collapse anytime soon is probably the same chance of a solar flare wiping out all technology.
The article ignores that many places are actually taking Bitcoin for payments etc.. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:22:09
GDAX because it's easy to use with 0% fees to buy and only 0.25% on a sale. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:55:30
Sign up for Coinbase, and then use GDAX which is sister company of coinbase, you just transfer your funds from Coinbase to GDAX. On GDAX you have 0% fees to buy, and 0.25% fee to sell using limit orders which are easy to understand. (Im irish)

Congrats man. I'm 22 and have 1.32 BTC, best decision I ever made. You can save quite a bit when you don't drink! You will NOT regret saving at this age. Many people much older than you are still living paycheck to paycheck, keep saving :)!
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:19:17
I paid 2.50 euro to move 1.32 BTC to GDAX from my trezors segwit address and it took like 10 mins for first confirm, and total of 40 for third confirmation so it got added to gdax. Not bad.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:41:38
Well hey, a solar flare would destroy more than Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:27:02
Yeah - it's important to understand what you are taking on with attempting to trade like that, you are going to be distracted with price charts and such, if you are busy at work and you missed something, or while you were asleep you are going to feel awful too.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:49:48
I have a trezor, is it OK to store my coin on the Trezor to avoid this hard fork?
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:36:53
Just finished first year of my first full time job and I'm 22. I saved 5k and bought a few months ago. Worth 7k now. Save early. My parents taught me to save and not care about brands or overpriced shit. Bitcoin will help you develop that mindset. Put money aside now. It's never too early to start saving so many people regret not saving, trust me. People much older than you are still living paycheck to paycheck and paying unnecessarily high phone bills, etc. Learn now!!!
