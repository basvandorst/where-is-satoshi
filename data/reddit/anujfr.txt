What happened to iota? There were lots of talk about iota last year I think, but haven't seen many posts recently.

Wait so should I not but yet? If I buy, the price will fall to ATL but I want to get in before the next moon mission. I don't know how to proceed anymore :'(

Not really. I know we are arguing semantics here and therefore this will be quite pedantic, so I offer you my apologies.
Now ASICs are defined as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, thus by definition an ASIC has a very specific use case. A GPU as we see them right now is by nature a general purpose device. Theoretically a GPU can do anything a general purpose CPU could albeit some applications might run incredibly slow whereas others might run incredibly fast. An ASIC is designed to do very few things very well whereas a GPU/CPU is designed to a variety of things. Think games, neural networks, folding proteins, simulating solar systems, calculating digits of pi, etc.

Shouldn't crypto - crypto trade be considered like-kind trade?

IRS please follow this example and let me cut my headache by 80%. If you want people to pay taxes you gotta make this shit simpler.

True but because Congress hasn't passed any law regarding crypto taxation yet, at least not that I know of, IRS for now is making their own rules.

That's what I thought. Thanks for the confirmation.

The owners of the website can do whatever they want considering it's their website and forking and experimentation is excellent as cryto is still in its infancy but this is straight up fraud. If they have faith in their fork, why go through such underhanded methods? Is Roger ver a con artist?
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:11:27
Thanks will do. Could you perhaps guide me the right direction?
