Great gift man. I gave my girlfriend $25 bucks worth back in December and now she’s up to .1 btc. Addicted just like me!

Cash app is probably the easiest on-ramp for most people. Plus it’s a little cheaper than Coinbase.

The age of my Reddit account does not equate to the age of my crypto involvement, good sir. So you’re goddamn right I’m saying HODL.

It’s called HODL

Any book I read that has a villain in it, I picture faketoshi every single time. Didn’t mean for it to happen it just happened.

The value will go back up, you want to just keep cash on the side and buy those dips. If you try to sell the top and buy the bottom you WILL lose money. If it was that easy everyone would do it.

You’re scared that we are “back in a bear market” because we dipped 500 bucks. This is all normal. We’d have to go back under 6k again before most people become actually worried. Just chill.

Nah I just keep track to slowly watch them die.

If you want to say trade 99% of you will lose more BTC than you will make. Go ahead and try but do you really think you can beat all those professionals/bots out there? Odds are against you. Just buy once a month or once a week and don’t stress about trading. You’ll make more in the long run.

Worst advice you could give them. Just buy and HODL.

True but satoshi and others have said if it didn’t have those first few years to gain strength and it went mainstream too fast, it would have failed. So in a way, it did lurked in the shadows for a while.

Yes. The more miners running their ASICS means higher hash rate which means higher security!
