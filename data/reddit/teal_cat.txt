Very happy to read the brilliant review and feedback. Always appreciated. I saw that most new comers to bitcoin were looking for a simple and easy exchange to buy with their usual payment methods. That's why this is made clear for them up front. 
I've put an title header to the trust rating column. Hopefully that gives more detail. 
I'm looking to expand more and write up some reviews of bitcoin exchanges as you mentioned. This requires a bit more time. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:48:33


Could you elaborate? I'm interested in hearing your experience.

Interesting question. I've made a page that tracks all the [top exchanges]( for btc and crypto. One thing that users keep asking me is to rank sites where you can buy bitcoin without ID verification. 


It is definitely an increasingly important factor for many people within the community. For example, look at [the growth]( since 2013 of people searching for places where they won't have to give up identifying information. You can see that this started to pick up around late 2013 - so right at the time when the authorities started to get worried that people were getting too much economic freedom.


Another pertinent question. It's a valid concern, especially since MtGox leaked thousands of users' identifying info after it shut down. But realistically, sites like Coinbase, or Kraken have now become stable financial institutions within this space. I say this to contrast the flimsy business practices going on at some exchanges back in 2013. The competition has risen, the serious exchange sites are the ones building trust and gaining all the users. Yes, these are still point of failures, but let's not forget some are insured up to the ceiling - so things are different in that respect. Still - caution is always best practice. 
As others have stated here, decentralized exchanges are gaining adoption among advanced users. Throughout these platforms, ID verification has no purpose. You may like to explore Bitsquare &amp; Bitshares - two of the best decentralized p2p digital assets exchanges.

I've actually read some solid reviews regarding bittylicious. It might be a good one to include for people searching for the best sites to buy bitcoin in the UK. I'll look into the platform and include if worthwhile. Let's see
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:59:07
Great point regarding fees. It's a good info to include, as fees do always keep changing - and can be quite high depending on the deposit method used. I'm looking into providing updated information on this through the public APIs available on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:52:13
Hey I appreciate the feedback re Coinbase. Are you mostly referring to the new user account freezes that have been reported here? I've been increasingly reading that support has not been very active on reddit (I think they also have their own subreddit which was getting slow response times).  
The original rationale for Coinbase is linked to it's convenience, usability, and geographic availability. Granted it's not the cheapest bitcoin exchange with regards to fees. But if you're a new bitcoiner in the USA, Europe, or many other regions - the process is far less daunting than counterparts currently available in those markets. The availability of simple credit card purchases makes this an attractive option (despite the fee) for people that really just need to make a once-off small bitcoin purchase. 
I'm looking into reviewing their new multisig vault wallet feature - which seems pretty advanced compared to what the competition has to offer. If anyone here has used it, i'd be delighted to hear your thoughts. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:48:05
That's a good point. I would like to re-examine my approach to Bitfinex. I will eventually re-list it, since the refund is being handled quite professionally - similarly to the way Poloniex dealt with their issue in the early days (on a much smaller loss). 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:41:16
Thanks for reaching out with those stats concerning bank transfers on Localbitcoins. I'll update that so it's more visible to users. 
It's always been my opinion that Localbitcoins is a great alternative for people wanting to buy btc with cash and/or actually meet other community members. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:44:54
Yes well said. I would like to eventually integrate volume data through each api available from exchanges. This would be very useful for more advanced users looking for day trading platforms too. I've also tried to encourage users to check out volumes by linking to bitcoinaverage. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:21:51
Yes exactly - very true. While I do understand that some customers would not want to go back on bitfinex. But the fact that new users are willingly happy to sign up and trade - knowing the facts about what happened - speaks for itself. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:02:42
Great, I appreciate the input. As you suggested, I've changed the first sentence to clear up the semantics a bit. 
Let's see if I can think of a better opener in the mean time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:25:23


This is valid, and very interesting point - especially so since 2016. In my opinion this theory self-validated itself following the DAO incident &amp; hard fork on Ethereum. We saw how major exchanges played a key role in deciding which chain was the main chain (keeping the "ETH" trading code) and which was not. Poloniex and Coinbase held all the power in this decision. 


I would argue that the reason for exchanges determining the outcome of a hard fork is not related to insolvency, but rather to the fact the exchanges are currently centralized institutions. 
Let's imagine that the large centralized exchanges were all in fact decentralized p2p platforms running similar code as bitsquare or bitshares. Who would hold the power and determine the outcome of hard fork in this scenario? I would argue that protocol figureheads (Core, Vitalik, Veer, Gavin...) would have far more say in swaying public opinion as to which chain was the 'default'. 
Because of current centralization in the exchanging of protocol tokens, less PR work is needed in order to establish a certain chain as the default following a hard fork. All one needs to do is have influence / control over the largest exchanges.

Hey thanks for your honest feedback about my Coinbase review. I appreciate the time. 
With regards to your point about funding, I did indeed include the bank that you reference:


Yes it's true that banks, and the dinosaur financial institutions are disliked - especially here. But I'm reviewing Coinbase from the perspective of a new user: How easy it is for them to get into this space safely. The overall experience for investing. I do understand that not everything is great all the same. 
From your comment it seems that my review is too favorable towards Coinbase. In your opinion, is there anything that I could add to give the overall facts a better balance ?
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:21:31
Great thanks for feedback. I've also been reading similar reviews of people generally satisfied with how things were handled - especially when you compare to other incidents elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:01:47
thanks for the detailed information regarding Bitfinex. I have added them back on the list now :) 
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:25:07
It's interesting with regards to Bitgo's role in the matter. While we don't yet know the exact details, it's quite respectful that bitfinex has put themselves forward to repay customers. I would say that Bitgo would not be in a position to afford repayment of all losses (should the blame be attributed to them).
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:21:21
Great, thanks for reaching out. I've updated the row CEX.IO to include this info.
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:12:07


Ok thanks for pointing this out regarding these bitcoin exchanges. Bitsquare has huge future potential, being p2p, though I'd love to see it accessible to all non-technical users. 


Looks good, especially for users wanting to trade bitcoin. Futures trading is definitely a use case for our top exchanges list. We'll look into reviewing this site and perhaps add it to our ranking. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:35:24
Interesting, LibertyX looks handy enough as a cash to bitcoin exchange. We'll look into it further and perhaps include it on our top 40 exchanges ranking. I have heard of Bitwage before, it seems to be growing in popularity too. Lets see...
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:14:25
Indeed, good point. I was sure to have put 5 up there, though I now see Twitter only take 4 poll choices maximum. This would be really nice with more sites to choose from. 
We chose to include the top exchanges from our [website's list]( Let me know what you think of the main ranking on our site - if you have time. Cheers 
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:01:52


Yeah I guess this might be easier for users to choose any site in the whole list. We're planning to do another user poll for the best cryptocurrency exchanges, so this might be an idea. 


Thanks for the feedback. We need to update/review the amount feedback on reddit and bitcointalk regarding these two exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:46:52
Great, I've had similar feedback elsewhere. Perhaps I'll add an extra column for pricing/commissions 
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:45:39


thanks, i hadn't heard of LibertyX before! I'll check them out...
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:47:40
the most cautious approach would be to withdraw to a wallet over which you control the private keys. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:20:39
hey great feedback there. I guess the ranking factors aren't clearly stated. Tomorrow I'll write up an explanation on the trust score, which is an overall standpoint from reading posts/reviews on bitcointalk. I've also given extra preference to bitcoin exchanges with multiple depositing options: ie credit card, paypal... 
Thanks for the feedback about Coinbase, you raise an interesting point. The ease of use gives it that attractiveness, but maybe their position should be reassessed. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:26:09
thanks, I've updated this now :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:49:21
good point - thanks for clarifying that info regarding Gemini offering coin splitting, I'll update that on the list right now.


Most exchanges having said they would offer coin splitting of BTC into Bitcoin Cash (BCC) have said it might take some time before they would be able to do so (as most exchanges want to wait and see how the situation plays out). Kraken is the main site to have said yes right out of the box.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:37:52
Here's a list of [exchanges facilitating coin-splitting]( &amp; Bitcoin Cash trading (from BTC to BCC). I've tried to keep the list as updated as possible, please reach out if any info is missing. 
As others have said here, Kraken is the most reputable exchange offering both trading of Bitcoin Cash and splitting of BTC tokens stored online into the new BCC tokens. 
There are also several other exchanges offering either one or both of these services to their users. Do remember that most exchanges will be halting trading or deposits/withdraws before and after the hard fork to minimize the risk of replay attacks happening on the new Bitcoin Cash chain. 
Some exchanges have even stated that they are waiting to see which will be the "official" bitcoin chain - depending of how much hashing power (the mining power) each one has. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:45:56
Indeed I have. Good on you :) I'll stick them up tomorrow 
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:47:37
Noted. Many people agree with you there. I'll take that into consideration for the next update. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:32:45
Gemini will according to their statement.
I've included all the details in the main table
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:26:23
Also updated this. Thanks for pointing it out. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 17:19:30
I set up a top bitcoin exchanges list. The aim was to rank 40+ bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges while providing a quick reference list to the community. You can find it here:
- 
Please let me know what you think. I'm always looking for feedback, and very open to suggestions to improve.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:45:01
haha the worries of cryptomillionaires
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:32:27
Done. I've added Bittrex official position (BCC trading and coinsplitting will be enabled)
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:48:00
Good one. I'm looking into Bittrex's stance right now... 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:46:06
Major, yes :) As with many bitcoin companies, bad PR does not stop them from being major players in this space. 
See my reply [here](
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:48:05
No, it's good-ish. 
People will be withdrawing their BTC less often from the exchanges. This is bad for users' safety, but good for de-congestioning the transaction backlog
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:49:22
Nice comment, good points. 


Though for altcoin-only exchanges there's not much choice. Poloniex and Yobit if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:39:01


Maybe. But with nearly [4 million monthly visits]( the lights are definitely still on. Yobit has double or triple the traffic of reputed sites like Shapeshift &amp; Bitstamp, and half the traffic of Kraken.com 
Yobit is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency-only exchange right now after Poloniex. That's some serious money being exchanged, and some serious profit being reaped. Good on them! Users go there because they need to. Poloniex is overloaded with the recent altcoin boom.
