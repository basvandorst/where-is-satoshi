Personally I believe that rec traders lose the most money following poor TA, especially when leveraged (ofc). Better to go for solid picks, also 90-95% of day traders using TA lose money medium / long term.
Good Trading?

I have a question...
Why did you make this post?
@_date: 2019-06-02 08:28:11
Just your usual Ponzi.
Lures in 100 people at 500 bucks.
Pays out 10 people, gives excuses to the rest
Those 10 invest more with him at higher stakes.
Then he runs off with the lot.
Simple scam, dont get caught out
