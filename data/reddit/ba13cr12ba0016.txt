I have 2. Had an issue with one of them (blockchain wouldn't sync) and support was nothing short of amazing.  I highly recommend it. Sturdy, useful, secure and great support.

Not at all, but a little less whiny about what a privately owned for profit company does with their own money might be a good start.

Was it 4 days ago when the most popular thread on was how Blockchain wasn't doing anything with their venture funding? That's gotto sting now.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:41:59
Debt? No. But they owe it to the community to continue on the path that Satoshi laid out. Which includes forks for blocksize increase in case you are still learning to read.

KeepKey ( I come off almost like a shill for them but they are just so great. Build quality, support, usability. All A+

It was quite a bit more than 100k by the end.

I's a working implementation of Lightning with modification. Considering it's meant as a high transaction throughput of micro transactions I don't see the need for full network security (that's why we have the Bitcoin network). 
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:55:24
KeepKey is slightly expensive but super easy to use, and amazing customer support.

Id' be fucked, since I don't have any hamsters though. Plenty of pants, I guess I could pool-hamster with someone missing pants, but having plenty of hamsters.

Lots of whales have been shorting since $800 and made FAR more money on the downhill ride the last 2 years than they have lost. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:42:35
Agreed. People are acting like it's a new problem, when in freaking 2013 we had full blocks. Either stakeholders get their shit together  , or I'm just gonna go ahead and diversify out of Bitcoin. This isn't even funny anymore.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:42:41
How are you the 'third largest' with 80 BTC? There are 100s with larger claims. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:28:05
They are just looking for Satoshi as well. If you answer question 1 with "I made it" they will call CNN.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:44:13
Everyone that's not mentally slow understands this, and also that there is a bias. But you know, we don't need bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:51:23
Nah, Gold, FIAT and prob IOTA, ETH, DIGX.
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:43:48
Well, that's not terrible actually. So in other words, people might see some money. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:57:49
Sure fire sign that ETH is about to fall through the basement. I'm short since 0.033
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:37:53
I think that's a little dishonest. There is no 'stealing from other creditors'. In a bankruptcy you try to get your money out, period. Not a single person would not have tried to get as much back as possible. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:49:51
It's not FUD because you don't like it. Saying that the devs and community has to get their shit together and increase blocksize and segwit isn't FUD, it's reality.

TXid or you are just another person that dislike Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-05-16 18:30:33
Doubt it. There isn't enough volume to use Dash to really tumble anything at a reasonable rate. Easier to just use a Bitcoin mixer, or just not care. There is still not a single instance of 'tainted coins' leading to anything.

When there is no more space in honey badger and he can't move, he'll care.

And the answer is still: We have no idea until we know exactly what the fork contains. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:56:55
I think you are missing the point. He had $5 million in Gox, are you saying he shouldn't try to get it back? Should he care about other people when assessing how to get HIS money back? No. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:48:04
I think we are proving that you can't read. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 21:09:21
Absolutely. But I read their implementation as alpha stage, and a wider acceptance would introduce more nodes securing the chain. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:24:43
Sure. But I would prob argue that 90% of the people having problems, have themselves to blame.
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:38:51
So, we are basically buying new scratch-n-sniff stickers to put on the Titanic. Gotcha, thank god people aren't wasting their time on block size increase, and soft forks. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:26:13
Of course it's unlikely, but in theory you can write whatever changes you want into a hard fork. You could literally replace proof of work, with proof of pants and hamsters. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:51:00




No idea, maybe the damn blockchain? Look at the blocks at the last rally.

Futures are worth whatever the contract says. I can issue you futures that are worth 0.00476 Bitcoin, half a can of Pepsi Max and a dead squirrel if I want to.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:25:45
I do. Altcoin's ability to send transactions or secure a network doesn't differ from Bitcoin at all. The difference in security or perceived value doesn't lay on the technical side but rather adoption and 'belief'. I am not saying those aren't important factors, but had "insert altcoin name here" launched at the same Time as Bitcoin, it would have had equal chance of becoming the leader. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:30:53
The fact that you have a plausible explanation doesn't make the claim false though. You did in fact claim them.
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:36:07
There is no answer to the question as stated. A hard fork CAN do pretty much anything, but nothing about a hard for states that it HAS to do that unless explicit.
@_date: 2016-05-27 21:00:50
I love that the Bitcoin community is so scared and inept that articles like these just get's down-voted instead of discussed. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:25:14
Mismanagement and expansion at far too high electricity costs. They sold over $100 million USD of hardware in 2014, amazing to manage to throw it away.
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:29:48
Good luck with that. $90 million left, attorneys take $50 million. Tick, Tock. Not a lot left.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:23:57
Rootstock will win. There is no network as secure and accepted as Bitcoin. Ethereum is fun, but rootstock can and will implement ALL ethereum functionality at start, faster and more secure. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:47:02
Since it get's thrown out. Sure. But that's also not the case here. If you read his explanation.
@_date: 2016-05-27 16:32:01
Ah, understood. Still really odd that they would do a split, and not percentage payout.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:40:43
Keepkey is brilliant, and the people behind it provide some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. No concerns here. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:41:19
Absolutely, in the same way that a family of 4 needs a bigger car = FUD
