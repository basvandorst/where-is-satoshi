The trick I find, is to just read the words which are there, and none of the ones that aren't.

Definitely a smart move IMO, and I agree about the Korean issue. I think you could reasonably expect more volatility ahead though... I've never seriously considered speculating in this market before, but now...

That isn't what I actually said.

I think it depends on the kind of investment... after this, I'd be looking to invest on the downswing, and then cash in on the next boom. Long-term though, is a very different proposition. If you want an investment that you can largely sit on and forget about, this seems like a poor choice.

I'm just surfing on waves of self-loathing and regret... and I'm not even drinking!!

Me too... I'm just trying not to actively hate myself too much right now.

Yes, but after all I have just spent several comments explaining to you that I've only been saying what I've been saying.
So... yes, my patience did wear a little thin.

You can pay attention to a long-term investment; in particular you wouldn't treat Bitcoins like a conservative ETF or a T-Bill.

We should start a support group... *sobs*

True, but I suspect that this will come down before it rises too much further. I could be wrong, and you could be right though.
