No I haven't, have you? You don't need tech security holes when the very traffic is being captured by these companies and the NSA. It's only the amount of computer power they have to analyse where the traffic is originating from and what other services that IP is using/logged into that holds global tracking back. Maybe we should reconvene in a decade?

With legislation and tech that traces your every movement online (such as the TICS bill in New Zealand, or having a device like the Google Fibre box as your router) this makes Bitcoin just as susceptible to being a perfectly traced system as any credit card or bank account.

Claims to want to accelerate the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. Clearly knows nothing about PR.
