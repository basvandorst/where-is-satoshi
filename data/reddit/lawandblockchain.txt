In short:
* lack of liquidity
* high transaction costs due to increased amount of on-chain transaction (when compared to centralized exchanges)
* bad UX/UI
* if matching is on-chain, lack of order types
* no good cross-chain DEX mechanisms

Actually, many decentralized exchanges don't require any KYC/AML. Their centralized counterparts require more personal information. You do however share your public key (and thus tx history) with everyone you trade with in decentralized systems.

Exactly! I really believe that the future of Bitcoin is almost fully dependent on whether the social construct behind it resonates with enough people. You cannot analyse Bitcoin without taking the underlying ideology in mind. It was born out of unhappiness with the current system and aims to let people participate in a new one.

Early rulers started to equate gold with something godly, and it quickly became a status symbol. Humans almost intuitively started placing a high value on gold, equating it with power, beauty, and the cultural elite thereafter. This happened in all civilizations that discovered it. 
This, combined with gold's beauty, portability, scarcity, unique density (no other metal outside the platinum group is as heavy), and the ease by which it could be melted, formed, and measured made it a natural trading medium thereafter. 
TL;DR It's shiny and nice = intrinsic value
