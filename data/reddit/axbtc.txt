soon you will have atomic swaps .. the majority of the coins that are compatible with bitcoin will be added as side-chains .. if this will work as it suppose to be,  than bitcoin will act like the spine of the of the bigger formed crypto-currency network, what impact do you think will have ? Atomic Swaps will be the BITCOIN ALLIANCE against the rest of the alts .. al least this is how I see it

are you thinking that this new alts will go so smooth to the top ? the majority of the alts didn't yet started having scaling problems. Try to synchronize ethereum blockchain :)) ... everyone talks about Ethereum and nobody has a copy of the blockchain on their pc, this is hilarious

if you think Bitcoin is over priced why are you still here ? fees will disappear with lightning network and atomic swaps. Segwit wasn't an upgrade for the users, it was an upgrade of the main core to implement Lightning network and side-chains .. stop complaining and wait a bit so everything gets tested correctly ...

majority of the people don't have programming skills and they don't really understand the concept of programmable money ... they still see it as a kind of paypal, this is sad ... but they will be educated in time, no worries

stripe it until you get burned, shift card is an old card without chip which it makes it very vulnerable to cloning

you can pay bills, car insurance, charity  and many others only with sort-code and account, so this is in fact a true story !!! 
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:52:50
2015 ? card with no chip ? only swipe :) most stupid card ever .. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:48:43
That's somehow true, well, strike from acinq will probably do the first part ...
 Now we realize that bitcoin network development it's still in the infancy fase ... so much more to develop ...

Bitrefill is a third party ... we are using bitcoin to escape from intermediaries ... then what's the point ? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:38:12
wow, so fast people are turning away from Tesla .. a few months ago everyone in the bitcoin community wanted one ... this is the human nature .. if you trow with shit in something it becomes shit :) ... How about if you can buy Tesla directly with bitcoin and pay at the electric chargers in bitcoin via lightning network , then Tesla will be amazing :)) 
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:30:52
then what's the point ? we can buy steam games with paypal or credit/debit card ... why use an intermediary?  we can use bitcoin directly ... we should presure Steam to add LN!

one of the best things possible, they should build a safe for huge quantities of gold and include also gold trading in their system and in this way you can exchange bitcoin to gold and gold to bitcoin/fiat instantly without owning the physical metal.

nice

depends on what you want to do with them, if you want to be anonymous you can exchange them in other currency like litecoin ...  and then exchange them back to your new bitcoin wallet .. and the track is lost , off-chain 
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:35:17
wahaha, here comes the Satoshi unit, best option so far, I like it!
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:24:33
we would need steam to accept LN and then  you can buy the games directly from them ... since they abandoned bitcoin payments I never bought any game from them and will not do it until they add it back as a payment option. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:48:27
This is the best Idea possible, BITCOIN deserves to have a similar symbol as email does, the impact of email was huge for the entire world and so does BITCOIN!!! . I already hope that this will get implemented as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:02:23
this companies are only using trackers .. no btc there at all
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:13:09
it's not about the ads reddit shows, it's about members posting about **Revolut, Etoro, Robinhood** ... this trading apps have nothing to do with Bitcoin - **THEY ARE NOT USING REAL BITCOINS ON THEIR PLATFORMS** ...
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:10:56
**IF YOU CANNOT WITHDRAW IT TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL/HARDWARE WALLET THEN IT'S NOT THE REAL THING** This platforms are only tracking the price of bitcoin ... **NO BITCOIN THERE**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:19:26
**THEY ARE JUST TRACKING THE PRICE OF BITCOIN, NO TRANSACTION HASH, NO WITHDRAW OPTION ... NOTHING** ... IT'S JUST NUMBERS IN A DATABASE AND THEY MAKE MONEY FROM IT .... AND YOU ARE BUYING JUST THIN AIR ... **NO BITCOIN**
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:23:47
The problem is that this companies are advertising bitcoin investments like "**buy bitcoin with Etoro", Buy BTC on REVOLUT, Buy Bitcoin on ROBINHOOD** .... this are non sense, **no real bitcoin there**, their advertisements are fake and they are just **SCAMMING PEOPLE**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:08:29
There are many exchanges **COINBASE, GEMINI, KRAKEN , BITSTAMP, LOCALBITCOINS ... and OTHER**

**IT'S STUCK BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL DON'T GET IT, PRIVATE KEYS, WITHDRAWAL OPTION TO YOUR OWN WALLET**
@_date: 2019-11-18 12:31:08
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:05:00
Buying from this platforms you don't accumulate nothing and you continue to **drive the price down not UP**, there are only some numbers in their database. **BUY BITCOIN ONLY FROM A REPUTABLE SOURCE FROM WHERE YOU CAN WITHDRAW IT ON YOUR PERSONAL/HARDWARE WALLET.**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:13:18
**IF YOU CANNOT WITHDRAW IT TO YOUR PERSONAL/HARDWARE WALLET THEN IT'S JUST NUMBERS IN THEIR DATABASE, FAKE BITCOIN TRACKERS** THAT THEY MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT ... BUY FROM A REPUTABLE EXCHANGE WHERE YOU GET REAL BITCOINS AND YOU CAN MOVE THEM TO YOUR OWN WALLET
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:15:36
It's shocking that you don't know that he didn't use BTC to buy at McDonalds  ... **Revolut doesn't use real BTC in their app**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:23:49
**YOU NEED TO EDUCATE YOURSELF, BITCOIN IT'S MORE THAN THE NUMBERS YOU SEE IN Etoro, Robinhood, Revolut account.**  **YOU CANNOT BUY REAL BITCOINS ON THIS PLATFORMS** so you are participating in DRIVING THE PRICE DOWN and less ADOPTION ....
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:25:07
**REVOLUT BTC it's just normal FIAT money ! No real BTC in their app, cannot send, cannot withdrawal ... fake BTC**
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:31:36
did you ever find a transaction hash, make a transaction with an unique amount on this platforms and try to find it on the block explorer.
**Disclaimer about a service of an unregulated product, are you out of your mind ? No WITHDRAWAL, NO TRANSFER TO EXTERNAL WALLET, NO TRANSACTION HASHES .... and you are still believing them ?**
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:18:34
**REVOLUT app doesn't use real BTC! it's just FIAT money**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:01:23
This platforms are just using trackers to track the price and are making commission on your trades. They don't involve any cryptocurrencies ... they don't have it, so **STOP BUYING THIN AIR** **!!! Buy from an reputable exchange where you can actually withdraw your BITCOIN on your private wallet !!!**
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:48:03
This is crap, revolut doesn't use real bitcoins. In fact in my opinion this should be illegal to do, but well welcome to the unregulated market where governments are doing everything possible to destroy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:27:48
You cannot withdraw your cryptocurrency from this platforms, they are just using trackers or futures ... so yes if you use this platforms to buy their **FAKE** "**Bitcoin**" then you should start educating yourself of what bitcoin does/means and how it works. **THERE IS NO REAL BITCOIN THERE WITHOUT AN OPTION OF WITHDRAWAL TO YOUR PERSONAL/HARDWARE WALLET**
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:02:18
If you can withdraw your bitcoin on your private/hardware wallet then it's **OK**
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:14:14
UK banks were always problematic with blocking accounts and so on ... try to make accounts with online banks like revolut, monzo, n26 , ing ... probably you have more in uk that I don't know and just rotate between them ..

I'm just waiting to see the first bitcoin wallet with integrated lightning payments so you can move satoshis easy without the need of a second application .. , and boom you will see the real power of lightning network (the killer app) 
@_date: 2016-02-05 12:10:25
Maybe Paypal will add bitcoin after the soft-fork/hardfork .. until then I see very small chances of implementing a cryptocurrency that will not work well . You have any idea what will happen with the already full blocks if Paypal directly implements Bitcoin?  I'm thinking that maybe they will implement Xapo in their payment options and maybe later on Bitcoin.(when sidechains or core are updated at a scale that makes transacting easy) This is my point of view.

2 fa auth and should solve your questions

The shop is using BitPay for processing invoices and has the withdrawal option setted in Bitcoin (it doesnt exchange it to fiat) as the shop wants to HODL some bitcoin.
