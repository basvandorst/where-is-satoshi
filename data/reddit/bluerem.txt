And you use insults instead of intellectual argument.

Ah, but that belief is why you should have an explanatory argument to show me the supposed error of my ways. If your response is to use the excuse that your opponent simply is 'bad' and post is 'without content' then it seems like you really have no argument at all. Just what it seems. And if you don't work with 'stupid' or posters without 'content'(whatever you want that to mean) then I would ask who is it that needs a good explanation more? The smart or the stupid poster? With your attitude you're discouraging yourself from having nice informed talks with strangers. Which means if you can't help yourself I can't continue this conversation since it will simply be a waste of both our times.

Read his comment again. He said 'old people are just as stupid as young people.' Your last statement is a rewording of what he just said. Keep in mind that ashlir is responding to a comment that is insinuating that older 'adults' are somehow superior to a '24 yo'.

My condolences. 
 Oh wait, I have some too...

How do we know this is happening now? (As opposed to other reasons for the price falling to where it is now)

Didn't mean to have it come off as chastising, just saying what I'm seeing.

What makes you think it's the younger guys who are posting memes and silly images? As with most technological phenomenons it is the older people who are trying to catch up with current trends ie. facebook. Most young people my age are already over the fad of memes. Have you seen the material at AdviceAnimals lately? It's been garbage and cringeworthy lies just for karma. If you want to start talking about age, you know what older guys do? They find a meme that's not even remotely clever and share it on their facebook or google+ and think they're the shit.  
  
Age has nothing to do with this. And if you think it does, in the tech and online world the average older person is going to be more prone to doing what the online community deems as immature or silly.
