Yes thank you, my verification papers was not accepted. I had to email them directly to get responded and to know that the papers were not accepted. I got a passport and was verified the day I sended it.

Please keep us informed, after how many days you had your 1st reply from them ? And did you open multiply tickets about your situation or only update the 1st one ? Thank you

Waiting since October 23 here... no reply at all. The thing is that I could withdraw over 100btc per day, but I knew I was not verified, so I decide to do the responsible thing to do and get verified. The automatic one did not work. So I opened a ticket October 23. No reply since and they changed my account from (withdraw) 100btc to 0.025btc, then tonight I realize that they changed it from 0.025 to 0. Strangely after I deposit all my bitcoin gold last night in bittrex.
