So who determines who wants to close? If the contract is in march. Can I only close in march? So why the immediate bankruptcy as people claim?

I honestly am curious who the hell out here just gives straight up cash/money for a gift? Let alone something that may not be understood by many.

Lol so you’re telling me that 4 years ago you’re thinking bitcoin is ready as a direct competitor to the most established payment system In the world?
Come on man

Honestly that's what people think back in 1k. Who the hell buys something that's not even real for 1k?

Hey I don't typically shill but I honestly struggle to find a better alternative if you are Canadian or if you use USD or CAD.
QuadrigaCX handles your transaction seemlessly and as long as you have an Interac Online debit card or Interac etransfer.
I only use interac online funding for the lowest fee option of 1.5% (all of which supposedly goes to the Interac service) then for every transaction QuadrigaCX takes 0.5% as fees. Lastly, they'll cover any BTC fee withdrawal so you don't have to worry about paying for the high fees these days since they'll handle that for you.
So suppose you wanna buy in 1000USD of bitcoin, they will lose 2% in total ($980 remaining). Any cryptocurrency you buy with that $980 will be yours.
This is not without downsides though. They have an insanely long verification process (7-10 days), minimal trading pairs (Only BTC/LTC/ETH/BCash), Simple order book (Good for simple buy-ins but not good enough for day traders). Interac Online only works with debit card that does not have the "visa debit" logo on it (For Canadians at least).
Lastly, don't take only my word for it as always with cryptocurrencies, do a bit of personal research on the exchange never hurts. I just gave the simpliest blimp.
Pm me for my referral link for sign up which I get the tiniest trading fee bonus from you instead of QuadrigaCX. You don't gain anything from using this but don't lose anything either.

So I get a long contract work now. How would shorting it work directly against you in the immediate term?
Don't you just have to pay the difference back on the contractual date? Sorry am dumb

I honestly don't get how you can pay $100 in fees for 2 transactions. Even at a non-segwit wallet transaction with priority fee was at most 6-10 dollars that I've paid couple weeks back, confirmed in less than 30 mins. 
At a segwit wallet with 3-4 dollars fees, I was confirmed again less than 30 minutes. 
I have moved about .4 Bitcoins for these 2 transactions, so I don't know where the fees that you are paying is coming from.

So how exactly would these decentralized exchange work?
