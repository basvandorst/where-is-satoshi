It’s as perfect as it gets. If you want a better life, you can make it happen.

Perhaps you should go live in Venezuela, you might like it better. No capitalism baby!

I said they _can_ make it happen. And they can. As well as someone born to an upper class family in New York _could_ end up broke and homeless. And that’s important. In capitalism, you can make your own decisions and they matter.

Get that off of comrade?
I appreciate the many points you made to defend socialism; oh wait... no you didn’t make any points. 
For someone that spends all their time being a brainwashed shill on Reddit, you sure aren’t very good at arguments, or even basic conversation.
Stay classy “USAisDyingLOL”.

Prove yourself right.

50 year old propaganda? The fuck you talking about? You’re as insane as your ridiculous political views.
You dodged all of my points and just decided to insult me instead of making any sort of rebuttal (expected from dipshits like yourself) so let me ask you this, do you think communism is better than capitalism? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:07:45
Capitalism is a failure? LOL want to point me to one time that the alternative has worked better? Or even worked at all? 
Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any other system in the world. 
Instead of this business keeping this guys money, would you rather have it be the _state_ which can take and hold you if they wanted to?  
Do you guys just have so much self hatred that you can’t accomplish anything so you blame capitalism? 
You made the claim that it’s capitalism’s fault, prove it.

Jesus I’ve never heard something so stupid in my life 
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:27:38
90% LOL Jesus Christ you’re delusional. Even if that was true, you think it would be capitalism’s fault? Want to explain that thought process?
You didn’t even answer the super simple question I asked you. 
Let me try again, do you think communism is better than capitalism? 
Try really really hard to address my points and come up with counter arguments this time, okay? I know it’s hard but you can do it.

In true freedom, there is no such thing as equality. People are different. They have different goals, aspirations, skills, discipline. 
Some people want to be a Jeff Bezos and own half the fuckin country while others just want to chill out and sell their paintings at the local farmers market. Both choices are fine, achieve-able and unequal, and both people are happy. And that’s the beauty of capitalism. Choice. Competition.

Because I’m not a brainwashed socialist?

Top 10% of Nordic countries hold far more percentage of the wealth than the top 10% of US do.
Anyways, more social programs work in places like Norway because their population is **tiny** and most of their wealth comes from natural resources.
Personally, I do not think perfect income equality is even possible and should not be strived for. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:52:37
Does it need to be identical? That’s very clearly impossible. People are not equal.

I mostly agree but I think the ability to be an outlier and succeed is very important in society and I’d say the US has a better system for that. 
Also, we have had many many cases of a corrupt government in control of everything and it has always been extremely negative but history has never seen the same thing with a corporation. I’m not implying it would be positive but it’s interesting to think about why it has happened so many times with government but never with business. Food for thought.

Norway is capitalist. Not as free market as the US though. 
Norway has higher wealth inequality compared to the US, as well. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:38:28
You made the original claim, with no back up. Give me any sort of coherent point.
It’s clear you can’t actually back anything up though, and still won’t answer a simple question. Expected.
