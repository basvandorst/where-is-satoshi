It seems to me this is GS' way of  trying to stay relevant by acknowledging this is the future, while simultaneously trying to use their influence to stunt bitcoin's growth.  Look at how they're suggesting limited growth lol. It's hilarious to me that they think we'll bite. If they have the gall to believe they can dictate the extent to hyperbitcoinization occurs they're completely out of touch with reality! Rather, I believe this was a subtle way for them to get the general public to believe there's limited upside. IMO that is absolutely wrong. Bitcoin is ONLY worth a few hundred billion dollars. Wait until it starts to mature. The current price will look incredibly cheap IMO! 
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:44:38
It must be purely a coincidence that right as bitcoin was hitting fresh highs for the year coinbase and two other major exchanges went offline within minutes of each other and we've been on a fairly sharp downward trend since. There are no other possible explanations other than pure coincidence. I mean it's not like this has ever happened before.. Right? Oh, unless you count the all time high incident which was exactly the same situation! Wake up folks. These institutions that regulate the fiat currency on ramps to our bitcoin are heavily invested in by the banks (aka bitcoins competition). Buy your bitcoin from them if you must but be sure to immediately move your bitcoin to wallets where you control the private keys. Remember that supply and demand determines value and if they control the supply they can continue to manipulate the price!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:03:58
Fortunately 95% of those folks only hold a small fraction of the bitcoin in existence. Most long-term holders won't sell the majority of their coins regardless of the fiat currency prices because they see the end game.  HODL people! Wall St is shaking the BTC Tree!  Don't let them scare you out of the financial revolution! 
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:11:32
Not at all. Actually, your client is just greedy and delusional thinking that there's OTC markets for the banksters. You will all buy on the regular markets eventually and when you do that's when the value of BTC will shine. Tick tock tick tock lol
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:27:08
I believe that if this option was available it would be additional incentive for people to run their own nodes and hence make bitcoin even more decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:46:29
I guess it depends on how you measure success.. MOE, SOV, UOA etc lol.  But I should have elaborated. We need to HODL until BTC can grow up to the point where big market plays can't kick it around so easily. Simultaneously, we need to wait until scaling solutions are firmly in place.  Once these two issues are resolved, we all win! 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:39:27
Thanks again! 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:43:18
So, the point of this post was that we could bring together the community to publicly discuss the best ways to store your bitcoin long term and have the community vet the responses. If you're not willing to elaborate on what you mean exactly then there's no reason to respond any further. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:52:39
I need to look into this more. How would I configure my bitcoin node running on Windows 10 to accept connections for putty? 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:36:15
How do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:39:56
I think so. Will need to research this a bit more. Thank you 
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:39:21
This might be  what I'm looking for although I will have to do some research. Is this something that I'd have to edit my nodes bitcoin dot conf file? If so can you give me some pointers? Thanks 
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:47:50
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:51:36
You guys are  hilarious! You do realize that if you really want in you're going to eventually capitulate and buy on the normal markets right? Although you may be a "large quantity buyer" you are certainly not the only one.  Don't worry, I'm sure some will fill your orders.. Just at much higher prices ;) Tick tock baby! 
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:47:59
Thank you very much for the info! I'm actually currently using TeamViewer but would prefer another option which isn't so bandwidth intensive. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:05:22
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:57:00
It's not ready to scale yet so therefore it's not ready to be used to the extent that the established currency systems are. Once lightning takes hold and the other scaling soloutions are implemented, it will be ready for prime time.  Now is the time for volatility!  It has to swell in market cap for it to be ready for when it is ready to be the replacement for the current system.  And, IMO, it will! 
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:17:37
If your post is any indication then I'm very savvy lmao. Looking forward to seeing how things play out in the next few years!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:12:25
Thanks for the reply. Yes that sounds like something that could certainly be a concern. I'm also really concerned about the potential for misinformation and downright manipulation across social media, traditional media etc. We're heading into the big leagues and they have resources on another level than we're accustomed to and they can play dirty! We're going to have to really keep our eyes peeled here and be diligent with keeping the community focused on the mission. Decentralization! 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:21:38
In my opinion Satoshi made it clear that he wanted bitcoin to be leaderlees. Should he be discovered in the future the community should respect his wishes and carry on without taking direction from him.  Should he ever be revealed publicly it should be presumed that he has been compromised and considered a liability to bitcoin revolution. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:45:33
It seems like I can already use that command without the option you mentioned. Not sure if they have changed things on my version but I'm running the most recent release. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 18:13:19
Thank you very much for your reply. I will certainly check into Glacier. Keep em coming folks! 
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:52:51
I 100% agree with you! In fact I have been trying to say the same thing for months now. What I'm starting to believe is that more and more people feel the same way that we do regarding purchasing the coin and then moving into addresses which we control off of the exchanges. I believe that this coupled with the fact of additional awareness to the masses via mainstream coverage of Bitcoin will eventually turn the tables and allow for us to finally have our peaceful Revolution that is Bitcoin and take our currency back! Time will tell but I do believe that we will be victorious.
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:59:00
I did a little digging online and it seems as though it will bring back the data about any transactions as long as the output is unspent. I still need to confirm though. Either way I appreciate your feedback. What I'm really looking for is to be able to run my own block Explorer without relying on any third party web site. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:56:10
Can you give me a bit more details on how to set this up? BTW excellent user name! 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:58:10
1) I'm not asking for anyone to make me anything
2) I'm not a coder.
I'm simply voicing my opinion to the community as to what I think would help both incentiveize nodes (decentralization) and also create additional independence for bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:40:29
No I mean for accessing my node remotely from android and windows devices. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:29:57
Thank you for the information. However I believe that if this option was available it would be additional incentive for people to run their own nodes and hence make bitcoin even more decentralized while also giving users further independence. 
 
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:28:41
This sounds interesting but I will need to research it further. After setting this option, how would I be able to look up bitcoin addresses and see the corresponding values associated with them even if they are not in my wallet? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:07:19
Thank you for the detailed reply. I will try to get this up and running. I'm assuming that I will need to edit the bitcoin dot conf file with some parameters. Is this right? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:09:20
I appreciate the link but I've confirmed that I meet the minimal hardware and internet requirements and as far as I know it's legal in my area. I'm now at the point where I'm asking the community for help. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:51:01
Thank you for that excellent info but I'd like to be able to do that with my own node remotely via an and and windows devices. Do you have any idea how how I can do this? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:03:49
Thank you for your help. When you say start tor, are you just saying to open a tor browser? I'm not familiar with tor at all. Thanks in advance! 
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:10:04
Thanks again for the help!  I'll give a try as soon as I can get to the laptop. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:43:16
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:06:36
I tried using pia with a port forwarding node but couldn't seem to get it running. Perhaps pia doesn't allow for bitcoin node port forwarding or perhaps I didn't edit the bitcoin conf file correctly. Not really sure. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:05:11
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:14:50
I'm considering it but need to research it a bit more first. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:26:27
I agree 100%. Unfortunately the real influx of Wall St money is with main St's 401k.  And unfortunately the gatekeepers are Wall St firms that will offer ETFs and mutual funds that something like BAKKT will usher in. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:24:19
Thank you for the info. From that link I just realized that this will apparently only allow for outgoing connections. My hope is that I can do both inbound and outbound connections anonymously. Do you have any suggestions on how best to go about this? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:26:45
Thanks.  I'll check it out.
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:54:21
Thank you for the clarification. I'll give it a try as soon as I get back to the laptop. Cheers! 
@_date: 2018-08-18 18:10:54
Exactly! This will have no direct effect on the price of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:18:25
Just found out that you can. Thank you for your help! 
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:04:37
What particular tor software are you referring to? I downloaded the tor browser but I feel like I'm missing something there. Also in the configuration file what is the exact snytax?  Thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:01:52
Thank you. Can you suggest any good wallets that do? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:11:05
Thanks for the reply. I'll definitely check that link out 
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:10:35
Hey thank you for the reply. Unfortunately I'm trying to access this from a Hotspot not from my personal router. It's an X finiti Hotspot so I can't configure the router
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:55:56
Thank you again Kevin! I think I'm going to need to learn about coding. I really would love to be able to look up the addresses. Either way thank you for your excellent help! 
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:29:08
Seems like an intelligent way for the system to slow the eventual rise of Bitcoin. Take a guy that appears pro bitcoin, put them up against critics to talk positively throughout the whole interview, then have him throw in an absurdly low valuation at the end. Ha ha good try guys but you're not fooling anyone into thinking 10 or 11k is fair valuation! HODLers will never sell it to Wall St. This is our peaceful revolution and we are not going to give you a single Satoshi! HODL people! 
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:12:36
I'll definitely check that out. Thank you 
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:17:32
Thank you. I should also note that during my test when trying to see if I could receive incoming connections, the IP address that it detected was the rideable IP address from my provider which is Comcast. Additionally the provider is how I'm accessing the internet via a hotspot and not through my router so I'm not sure if perhaps the provider is limiting what can be done on these hot spots as far as which ports are open and so on. Do you have any ideas as far as anyone who has used Xfinity hotspots as access point for Bitcoin nodes?
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:08:06
I'd certainly be interested in trying to run it through tor but I don't have any experience using tor. Can you point me to the specific tor software you're referring to?  Also I'm not familiar with setting up the bitcoin. Conf file so I'd need assistance with the snytax. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:02:26
Thanks. I'll definitely take a look at it! 
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:13:46
Thank you. Can you connect to your own node with this wallet? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:43:21
Not broadcasting your own IP address 
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:11:00
Thank you very much. I'll need to do some research on tor. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:16:27
I guess I wasn't the only one who sees it this way :  
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:05:48
Thank you very much! 
@_date: 2017-03-19 03:05:24
Oh OK thanks. I thought there was some kind of abnormal reporting requirements.  I remember reading something about it being taxed as property or whatnot. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:35:08
I hope this is a sign that people are finally waking up and storing their own bitcoin off these back back exchanges that manipulate the price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 16:58:42
IMO that is the biggest hurdle we face.  I hope that the people who do grasps these concepts realize the importance of creating a truly grassroots movement here with enlightening the people of the world who are currently enslaved by our fiat overlords.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:53:09
I just don't get it. I mean every smart money person I've talked to about this puts the odds of SEC approval between 20-30% at best. This being the case I'm pretty sure that the market is pricing it accordingly.  
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:01:35
Isn't it possible that the rally isn't related to the pending SEC decision? Perhaps people are finally starting to wake up and realize this is a superior asset and will very likely change the world. I personally think regardless of whether or not this fund is approved that bitcoin will continue to ascend in value vs fiat currency.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:01:02
Do you know if they're any better? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:19:41
The use case for bitcoin is medium of exchange (MOE), unit of account (UOA), and store of value (SOV).  You can't eat gold or dollars either after all. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:41:30
I  definitely agree. In fact I believe that most people who own it are holding and not trading. My theory is that in order to suppress the price large interests are selling back and forth between themselves on the public markets via wash sales. It's fascinating to see this play out. These public exchanges simultaneously have over the counter markers (OTC) for big players to buy without "affecting" the regular markets. The CFTC also has cash settled futures trading in bitcoin which use these public markets as their reference rates to determine whether an option is in or out of the money. The good thing about Bitcoin is that since it's finite and more and more people are becoming dollar cost averaging people they will eventually lose their grip on the price and, IMO bitcoin will rise substantially. Well, as long as they store their own keys in their own possession and decline custodial solutions that is. Otherwise the whole value proposition of supply and demand that Bitcoin achieves will be defeated by financialization / rehypothification. But I'm confident that there are (or at the very least will be soon) be enough enlightened souls to achieve critical mass in turning the tables to achieve bitcoins destiny of the new global financial standard :) 
@_date: 2019-03-31 16:42:39
I've noticed a substantial increase in the amount of data my node has been transmitting in the last few weeks. Any theories as to why that would be? 
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:21:55
Yes my bitcoin brethren!  Ever since bitcoin I can now genuinely say I have a truly optimistic view of the future! 
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:38:22
So here's the thing. With bitcoin if there truly is a fixed supply and you can easily purchase and take physical custody of it via your own private keys, and considering the superiority of it to fiat and gold, all that should be necessary for a huge rally is public education and time. Once critical mass happens and there are enough dollar cost averaging folks taking physical custody Wall St can say whatever they want with cash settled futures. If there's no actual bitcoins for sale to the main market until lambo land because the people say so then that's where it will trade. I believe we as people still have the power to break Bitcoin free from Wall St. HODL strong people and HODL your own keys! 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:51:38
100% Agree!  Keep Wall St as far away from Bitcoin as possible! 
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:59:04
You can if you roll your own bitcoin addresses with dice and generate a P2PKH address with an offline computer then print out the paper wallets all entirely offline.  Note that ideally you'd do so with 16 sided dice each representing each hexadecimal states. Generate 64 random rolls then boom!  You have your own truly random private key!  No trusting any wallets whatsoever. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:54:47
While I guess I can understand that point of view, I also understand that all markets have a psychological aspect to them. The main point I was trying to make here was that I hope people interested in entering bitcoin aren't distracted by the erroneous though that bitcoin are currently valued as much as gold. Bitcoin isn't even 1% of the gold market. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:58:50
In my opinion we (as the bitcoin community) need to have a grassroots movement to try and pry away the fiat currency producers away from the exchanges. Possibly creating distributed, autonomous, open source exchanges.  If not then they will always be able to control the fiat price of bitcoins or whatever other assets trade on the exchanges they own. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:24:19
I definitely agree. In fact most people who own it are holding and not trading.

@_date: 2019-03-26 17:01:04
Sorry, that should of read finite.  I've corrected it since.  Furthermore while I do agree that those assets certainly have their places and are valuable, they are not exactly finite as you can always find more of any of those (find a new oil well, discovery more gold deposits, eventually asteroid/moon/interplanetary mining operations) vs. a truly fixed bitcoin cap.  Think about it.  
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:37:47
I actually don't know much about ethereum however I did mention this potentially symbiotic relationship in a previous post.   However I'm not entirely sure it would be necessary to run on ethereum to be successfully implemented.   
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:39:08
I wouldn't say that the largest US exchange is a blip.   Besides if Coinbase has banks money invested,  I wonder how many other exchanges are in their pockets. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:00:22
Hey, douchebag, a few things:
- I'm not new to bitcoin
- I've never claimed to be a Coder or to have analyzed the source code
- I don't care about your opinion except for the fact that people like you can potentially dissuade other altruistic pro bitcoin advocates from seeking out community support.
Oh and lastly, anyone (even non coders like myself), can find bugs. You'd think someone with clearly such a high level of intellect and education like yourself would realize this. But hey, the more you know right? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:04:10
I'm not saying anything negative about Bitcoin itself.  I love what Bitcoin represents!   I'm just simply saying that no matter how good an idea is,  if the entry ramps in adoption for that idea is owned / managed by the competition then how can it ever succeed unless they wanted it to.   The point of me posting this is to try and spur peoples thoughts about this subject.  Perhaps as a generally altruistic bunch here we can imagine a system that could operate as an exchange outside the influence of the banks.    Please share any thoughts.  Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:12:14
Because they initially responded to my email inquiry regarding my inability to access the site.  Since then they replied that they have temporarily disabled my account to keep it safe.  They then wanted me to list any unauthorized transactions and acted like my account was potentially compromised.  They did all of this rather than tell me details as to what the accessibility problem was. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:54:57
I believe that this is an issue that can be overcome by the community if they're fully committed and are willing and able to dedicate time to it.  I honestly think that the idea of an exchange platform that has open source code could be the answer.  Maybe even one that develops standards by which Bitcoin trades commence.   Perhaps even an api interface to these open source standards could be built into wallets themselves!  I really think this group has a lot of bright people with a lot of talent that are committed to helping to change the world for the better.  If  at a minimum I can submit an idea to the community and someone picks it up and runs with it who has the means then I will feel like I helped. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:48:06
It was also down for me too.  I then reported it to their support email address and rather than own the issue they disabled my account!  I'm currently trying to figure out how to get access restored to my account ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:28:04
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:42:53
Unfortunately no matter how genuinely altruistic people are initially,  greed is a inevitable human flaw that can be exposed by the banksters. This being the case then perhaps the only solution would be to operate autonomous exchanges with open source software.   I'm certainly not well versed on etherum but I understand that it allows for something called DAOs and DAPPs.  Perhaps the answer to the exchange dilemma could be resolved by implementing exchanges based on DAOs and /or DAPP technology. This way there would be no corruptible human factor to worry about. Trust me I'm not trying to root for a competing currency here.  I'm just trying to put ideas out there for your consideration.  Bitcoin has the potential to truly revolutionize  humanity and we should all do our best to make it happen.   
@_date: 2017-01-31 06:42:05
Oh OK.  So it wasn't with the code for the site itself,  rather an Android issue.  Right?  
@_date: 2017-01-31 06:23:04
Why do you think it's bad?  Is there some identifiable pattern to it? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:50:06
I can appreciate that.  What really concerns me more than anything is that when I reported the issue to their support group (prior to knowing about it being widespread),  they didn't own up to it.  Instead they disabled my account! 
@_date: 2018-10-12 00:34:57
Well I think it's important for the community to be able to confirm that what these large corporations are entering this Arena say is going on with respect to supply and demand is actually what's going on. However I have a hard time believing that considering the circumstances and I think that we has a Community need to get together and figure out a way to confirm the actual supply and demand ratio. I think the best way to in order to be able to do that is to educate Community how to be able to do so independently. Financialization is a real threat! 
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:40:16
Thanks for your reply. To me the point of this post wasn't really about coinbase so much as it was to designed to highlight the fact that the banksters have their tentacles all over bitcoin's fiat value via exchange investment (influence). If coinbase is one (major) exchange that we know about, how many don't we? It was also to suggest to the community a potential workaround to this conflict of interest via distributed open-source exchanges. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 06:16:14
Just bought a little more on the dip and holding longterm.  Best investment here with respect to the risk / reward ratio in my humble opinion. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:42:02
Although there are genuine cases of people wanting to divest their whale holdings for various reasons, a lot of OTC sellers are governments (aka the banks bitches) who have confiscated BTC for sale to the highest bidders (elite / connected folks).  At the end of the day this manipulation tactic will eventually fail as people continue to buy more and more. And, since bitcoin is only created at a fixed, slow, rate that can't keep up with demand, well, I'll let you put that together ;) 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:36:25
While I would imagine that there is likely to be natural advances and declines in bitcoin, I believe the last 6 months have been aggressive manipulation to the downside.  I  keep a few things in mind:
-supply and demand determines value 
-unlike any other commodity in history, there is a true finite value
-unlike any other market, bitcoin cannot be controlled.
-unlike any other crypto currency, the creator/s are unknown and possibly even dead.  This means with the decentralized nature of bitcoin there are no pressure points to bend bitcoin to the fiat systems will.
-more and more people learning about btc and HODLin
-wall st aggressively creating trading desks hedge funds. 
-lightning network close to allowing bitcoin transactions on part and eventually greater than visas capacity. 
So all that being said, yeah I belive their time of artificially restraining the price of bitcoin is very limited ;) 
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:26:53
Thank you for your reply. This is actually where things get hairy. Especially when considering that the unit of account (UOA) for price is currently expressed in USD fiat which is competing with bitcoin. The value of the USD can and is constantly manipulated by the big banks yet the price of the dollar is still one dollar. The value however is in constant decline since the inception of the federal reserve. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:39:07
Absolutely! Plus the elite bots with APIs to the pleb exchanges don't have enough BTC to keep the market down for long IMO 
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:01:48
LMAO. They want to base the price based on OTC?  HAHA OK! LMBO 
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:31:32
Not if people would just wake up and take physical possession of their own keys!  I just don't get why people don't see the urgency of this basic concept. We're letting the legacy financial institutions dictate the price of our currency (bitcoin) in fiat currency by letting them have possession of our keys. This is absolutely insane!

If these exchanges hold the largest amount of the tradeable supply of bitcoin then they set the price. For example they can theoretically manipulate the price in a few ways such as:
1) Sell multiples of the true amount of Bitcoin they to users with the knowledge that most will never request their own private keys 
And/or 
2) use bots to trade back and forth with themselves or others to set the price on their exchanges.
Fortunately with bitcoin there's truly only a finite amount so as people start to collectively wake up and dollar cost average and HODL their own keys eventually this should self right itself IMO
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:14:26
Please elaborate.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:14:44
The wallets don't have addresses. Wallets are programs that manage private keys. The only visible item that I'm aware of is the UTXO set which shows all the unspent transaction outputs. There's no way that I'm aware of to identify the amount of wallets, only the number of addresses that have actual bitcoin UTXOs associated with them.
Additionally, just with gold and IOUs of bankers past, there's no reason technically speaking that conbase or any other exchange could oversell their supply as their users do not have access to their private keys. The only way to truly own bitcoin is to control your own private keys (aka take physical possession).  Until critical mass understands this (and that this is the whole point of bitcoin / no middle men) then the price will be set by the Banks which are the largest backers of the exchanges!
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:32:15
So they say and their exchanges are what we look at to determine the last trade. Why should we trust these organizations that clearly have their largest investors best interests at heart (the banks)? Why couldnt they just simply post some bs website that spits out fake trade info that everyone just believes without question?  I think it's rediculos for us to leave our bitcoin on these sites considering their huge conflict of interest here.
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:41:27
True but even if a small percentage becomes holders, the banks will eventually not be able to control the market with cash settled futures.  It will be interesting to watch the banksters trip over themselves trying to get every last Satoshi they can exacerbating their own irrelevance.  
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:13:56
Unfortunately just moving the coins isn't going to address any of what I posted about regarding the circle of trust. This is a huge potential attract surface when relying on wallet distributions. We need to pry our bitcoin out of the banks and Wall St's grip or they will continue to manipulate our bitcoin. The only way to do that is by people taking physical possession of their coins and knowing with mathematical certainty that they in fact have their coins exclusively in their control.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:38:05
I believe that the volume was artificially high with bots for the elite selling the same coins back and forth through APIs on the "Pleb Exchanges". I also believe that because more "plebs" are becoming educated to what fiat and Bitcoin are its driving them to buy more bitcoin. I believe that the elites bots no longer have the bitcoin they used to to trade back and forth to themselves as more plebs are holding and moving to cold storage off these exchanges. Although the volume is lower, most of it IMO was fake and more people than ever are HODLers! ;)

The reason I'm advocating HODLing into P2PKH is that it's currently (from the best of my knowledge) the only address type that allows for a standardized way to instantly confirm you do in fact own the bitcoin at theses addresses. As you can imagine the competitors here (banks, Wall St, etc) have unlimited resources and centuries of experience perfecting the art of manipulating markets that have multiples of bitcoins market caps. The difference here is that they cannot financialize bitcoin if people take physical possession and can confirm they themselves have control of their adfersses. Until you can do that with an industry vetted standard for segwit then how would the averge user know whether this is an attempt to financialize bitcoin. My thoughts are dollar cost average and HODL BTC into P2PKH addressees that you create yourself by rolling dice. Then, if you actually want to spend, only do do with wallets that allow you to connect to your own personal node.
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:53:26
Using your own downloaded copy of the Bitcoin Core node software enter the following command in the console:
It will take a few minutes to complete but running this command will add up all of the current unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from your own copy of the bitcoin blockchain! 
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:47:45
I had never heard of this before. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will try to research this further. However, it still should be feasible to test P2PKH addresses that you roll your own (dice) and after gaining confidence with the signing / verification technique with a few addresses,  simply create other addresses the same way and not sign / verify.
@_date: 2019-10-02 23:33:31
My understanding is that with SEGWIT addresses that by using a private key to sign a message isn't really conclusive evidence of full control of that address due to the fact that for segwit addresses it may require more than one private key and /or an output of a script to unlock the funds at the address. That's why it was explained to me that there has yet to be an official standard with respect to signing SEGWIT addresses. Is this not correct?
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:21:21
With millions and millions of people now  aware and interested in bitcoin and its benefits over traditional currency / assets, and the ability for it to be independently verified by anyone anywhere anytime with a node, it should be exponentially higher IMO.  Couple this with all the abilities individuals have with this asset they cannot with others (walking around with their life savings in their heads for example), it should be a multi trillion dollar asset IMO.  I believe that one's the second layer scaling Solutions are fully implemented and people wake up to the reality that they need to take physical possession away from the centralized institutions which are currently in my opinion manipulating the price that this will in fact be a multitrillion-dollar asset. I guess time will tell and hopefully sooner rather than later.

@_date: 2019-10-03 00:44:42
I'm simply posting my thoughts on a possible attack surface that should be evaluated and considered by the community. All I know for sure is that  one can conclusively confirm ownership of P2PKH addresses via signing /verification of messages and that SEGWIT seemingly has no sigining standards yet and therfore you're expanding your circle of trust into something that is trustless. Considering this it would make no difference in the functionality of bitcoin if people took this step if they plan to HODL anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:05:58
Wall St can only get so many of the 16.7 million bitcoins before they launch their futures products and try to control its price. Don't let them be yours! They will shake this BTC with all their might. Remember, this is OUR currency, not THEIR product! They don't determine the VALUE of BTC..WE DO!!

Yes, yes they are. In fact on average currently 1800 which I would imagine at least some of the miners are hardcore HODLers. Even assuming that none were, that's only 14.4 million dollars worth per day at 8k per bitcoin. Not much considering there &gt;7.5 billion humans.. Just sayin.

You would think that the crypto community by in large would be against the banks indirect ownership and control of the vast majority of bitcoins representing the market. IMO decentralized exchanges are essential if we are ever to see a truly open marketplace based truly on supply and demand. While I absolutely agree with Andreas  "Not your keys not your bitcoin", I also understand that with the banks being so heavily invested in all of the largest exchanges controlling the fiat on and off ramps that it's only a piece of the fiat currency value of the price of bitcoin. I remember the ATH back in December 2017.  Bitcoin was going absolutely crazy! Then all of a sudden, Coinbase went offline along with all of other larger exchange the same time. When things get outside of their control they just pull the plug and wait for the buying pressure to subside (aka manipulate the price lower).  We need to pry every single Satoshi off of these bank backed exchanges until open source decentralized exchanges are ready for prime time. Unless we do this then between commingling, rehypothification, cash settled futures and OTC markets the fiat currency producers will state the fiat currency value of Bitcoin as they deem appropriate. Remember that the entire value proposition of bitcoin is its unique supply and demand profile with it being the first truly finite asset in human history with individual custody / independent verification a built in feature!  In my opinion, once we get this fact (even  a relatively small percentage of the "bitcoin holders") then their game is over and the next level in human evolution can begin unabated.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:00:34
While on the surface this would seem like a fair point of view, consider the fact that Bitcoin is much more than money / currency. It will go after huge swaths of traditional store of values (SOV) such as gold etc. Especially when the collective realization that Bitcoin is the first truly finite asset. The future is looking very bright indeed!

I've also noticed these 16.1 nodes. I wonder what this is all about. I hope it's not some kind of malicious activity and that people smarter than me are looking at this. When considering data caps at ISPs are generally the rule rather than the exception, this could potentially decrease decentralized nodes. Me personally I'll just pay the extra fee for unlimited data but I don't know if that's how the majority of node operators would feel. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 13:10:13
Something certainly does seem to have changed recently. My bitcoin core node has been transmitting much more data this past month or so vs any other point in time.  If anyone has any insight as to what or why I'd certainly appreciate it. 
Also, it's important to note that although I am a huge fan of bitcoin cores node, I think it's important to have other node builds up and running to maintain a decentralized environment.

The problem is that the biggest banks are the biggest holders of bitcoin via the major exchanges (usaa / coinbase etc) they have major investments in. People think that mass adoption is key for bitcoins price appreciating but that won't happen if people continue to buy and keep bitcoins on these bank owned exchanges! Remember guys banks create dollars which are direct competition to bitcoin. If they hold the majority of the bitcoins they can manipulate the price up down or sideways for as long as they want. The true free market for bitcoin will come when people learn to hold their own keys and not before.

@_date: 2018-11-30 14:55:16
A few other things to consider:
- OTC (Over The Counter) markets are where most of the large value trades occur. Why wouldn't these exchanges force institutions and big money into the same ones we use? If so can you imagine what the price would be? 
- Futures prices which have reference rates derived from the exchanges the average people must use. 
- The CFTC regulates futures and is a government organization funded by tax payers. 
- Run your own node so as to be able to independently confirm bitcoin transactions

Leaving your Bitcoin on the exchanges which are backed by Banks create an opportunity for these organizations to be able to control the US dollar value of Bitcoin. This is based on the simple Market principle of supply and demand determining value. When people just by and leave their Bitcoin on the exchanges these exchanges then have the world's largest wallets. Once they have the largest wallets and then also considering that they are back by the Banks which are direct competition to bitcoin, you can see how there is both means and motivation to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. So for me I personally suggest the people simply dollar cost average Bitcoin and move their currency off of the exchanges into walls of they control. This eliminates the possibility of the exchanges being able to manipulate the corns once enough people subscribe to this principle of dollar cost averaging and holding off the exchanges. Until this happens to a sizable enough level these exchanges will be able to control the values of Bitcoin in terms of dollar cost since they have the largest in the world

The value of bitcoin will not be dictated by mass adoption if people don't take physical custody of their bitcoin.  If they continue leaving them on these exchanges which are} heavily invested in by banks then these banks control the largest wallets in the world and hence the price of bitcoin.

Thanks. While I understand it can be calculated based on how many blocks vs the reward associated with each block, how would one know if there were any exploits or bugs which may have introduced additional bitcoins? Is there some way to view the UTXOs and independently verify the true current amount? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:31:09
That's certainly true however it goes way deeper than that. If everybody buys a small percentage of crypto and leaves it on the exchanges because they don't care if they lose it then they are effectively dooming crypto because the current financial order controls these exchanges and then has the means to ensure its never a threat via price manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:05:31
What a shame. How can it be that people willingly sign up for these scams?  Bitcoin is supposed to be about financial autonomy!  How can anyone be sure they even have bought bitcoins in such a crazy idea?  I mean anyone can say they sold you anything for any price if they never have to provide proof of it or ever have to provide a means for you to take physical custody of it.  
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:29:37
Thank you for all the information with this post it is very educational. However I do seem to think that I have a very similar a simple answer to this particular conundrum. If everyone did go ahead and move their Bitcoin off of the exchanges into wall that they personally controlled and contained a dollar cost average then theoretically only a small percentage of the overall population we need to participate in this type of approach to remove all control over any physical Bitcoins that are mined or that currently exist. At this point I would think that this house of cards would come crashing down and Bitcoin would be left standing solid. Well I understand them in the short-term that these Financial attacks on bitcoin scarcity that can potentially be damaging to the price in u.s. dollars., I do think that eventually people will learn to take their own cryptocurrency into their own possession and remove any possible control that the Legacy financial institutions have with respect to manipulating the price. Especially since anyone anywhere could at any time run their own Bitcoin node and validate the status of the network as well as which Bitcoins are at what addresses.

What seems odd is that there appears to be 170.17070069 less bitcoin than there should be assuming the following:
50 new bitcoin created for the first 210,000 =10,500,000
Plus 
25 new bitcoin for the second 210,000 blocks = 5,250,000
Plus (at the time) 129,684 blocks at 12.5 bitcoin each = 1,621,050
For a grand total of 17,371,050
Minus 
17,370,879. 82929931

Just make sure you move them off the exchanges because most if not all are backed by the banks themselves who is directl competition to bitcoin. If you just "buy bitcoin" and leave them on these exchanges then you're not really changing the supply demand profile of bitcoin because you keep these bank backed exchanges in control of the largest Bitcoin wallets on the planet!

While I agree with you with respect to it being a best practice, I don't think that the masses who jumped into Bitcoin really delved into the details about the dangers associated with centralization of exchanges and who all was behind the masks at these exchanges. Another major issue that I see is education pennetration  to the masses. Obviously when looking at Bitcoins true potential it is imperative that you be informed about the current fiat currency system and then learn about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is to see why Bitcoin is Superior in every way.

While you make an interesting point, I don't believe that you need to have many bitcoins traded to achieve sufficient liquidity. The same can be achieved with higher USD / BTC prices and more USD into Bitcoin. Liquidity isn't dependent on the low USD price per coin.  If there ever is a need there's no reason that bitcoin can't modify the total number of satoshis per bitcoin (a unit subsatoshi if you will). 
@_date: 2019-01-04 03:00:20
Again the value of anything (including currency) is based on supply and demand. In regards to your mention that nobody is using bitcoin as a currency, well, it's still just begining to be able scale. At last check the lightning network is only just now budding with ~500 BTC total capacity. Additionally the masses need to be educated about the reasons for bitcoins existence (immutable, sensorship resistant, individual sovereignty, decentralized currency of the people etc).  Once the second layer solutions have evolved to the point where it can support the transaction demand for 8 billion people + IOT devices you will see how much it will be used.  I suspect your post won't age well but time will certainly tell. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:38:43
If you remove the coins from the exchanges that you are HODLing, and others do the same, while even more folks try to buy more, then the value will truly reflect supply and demand. Not automated algorithms trading potentially "borrowed" coins.

Of course it doesn't. It wasn't intended to actually be a mathmatical equation. Rather it was simply intended to reiterate the fact of how scarce an asset that Bitcoin is. I guess what I was really trying to illustrate is that considering its scarcity and the increasing demand for bitcoin, plus the fact that there's hardcore HODLers dollar cost averaging and holding their own keys creates for bitcoin the best possible risk reward, supply and demand ROIs possible. It's just a matter of time and education of the masses until the real flippening happens (fiat to BTC).

So, just a few things :
- When I said open market I was referring to the fact that almost anyone can create an account on an exchange and purchase bitcoin
- when I said physical custody   I was referring to the fact that anyone can transfer bitcoin acquired an these exchanges to addresses they control and control their private keys 
- Ease of use will come once second layer is scaled properly (which, by the way is currently underway) and the wallet apps integrate 2nd layer solutions with easy to use interfaces. This will come when it's appropriate and not before
 IMO we have an incredible opportunity with respect to the risk / reward aspect of bitcoin to dollar cost average and hold our own keys. By the time it's ready we won't need to sell our precious bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:03:13
Supply and demand determines value period. Whether its for gold, bitcoins or dollars or any other fiat currency. With the US dollar as the current world reserve currency coupled with the fact that there's been a decoupling of USD to gold to allow for the infinite creation of dollars, this is the reason that fiat currency is deflationary. Bitcoin as you know is in stark contrast to this as the inflation rate is known and therefore, as you mentioned, it is deflationary. As far as the theory regarding the inability to use a deflationary currency due to its likelihood of inspiring the hoarding of bitcoins, I don't see this as a problem. People will still need to eat, buy cars, homes, travel, and buy anything else they need in life. If anything I believe been having a deflationary currency like Bitcoin would actually be a net positive for not only Humanity but for the planet as a whole due to the fact that we won't be inspired to create more and more built-in obsolescence products but rather products that last for a much longer period of time and require less natural resources to create these.

People will spend whatever currency is used as a standard currency regardless of whether it's inflationary or deflationary in nature due to the fact that humans have finite lives and are consumers for life. Consumers meaning they consume food, require shelter, are social animals that require communication systems, and if they have the means they try to utilize their limited lifespans trying to experience as much as possible while they are able to.  Where I believe you are wrong is where you appear that you are confusing the purchasing power increase of a deflationary currency like Bitcoin and the inflationary weakness of a fiat currency like the dollar. Whether the currency goes up or down doesn't change that humans are consumers and will need to perform all the items outlined above.
Edited to correct inflationary to deflationary when referring to bitcoin.

Obviously I meant to say deflationary for bitcoin. Come on now. Also there has never been anything like Bitcoin in history so it's very difficult to draw conclusions on exactly how things will play out. IMO however I believe that Bitcoin will act as a MOE, SOV and eventually a UOA after enough time but then again time will tell.

Why would he be someone who cared about the price? I mean isn't this guy uber rich? It must mean he either had a ton of BTC or he really didn't and is making a big deal about him selling for some unknown reason. Very interesting.

Ideal properties of money :
1. General Acceptability 2. Portability 3. Indestructibility or Durability 4. Homogeneity 5. Divisibility 6. Malleability 7. Cognizability 8. Stability of Value
Bitcoin will be superior to any previous forms of money once its ready for the masses. 
Also, currency has value and this value is determined by supply and demand. While I'm always open to learning something new, I don't see any way of escaping this fact. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:53:10
Thank you for your reply. I certainly agree with several of the points you made however I also believe that when looking at the price it's important to understand that although in long run it will likely be irrelevant, in interim period it is what initially attracts the masses to evaluate what Bitcoin is all about and understanding why it is valuable Etc. Additionally if the value is able to be manipulated and depressed for a prolonged period of time because of folks keeping their Bitcoin on exchanges, then the market cap won't mature to the point where it can be used as a medium of exchange. I believe it's very important for us to not only understand why it is important to have your own keys, but also to ensure that we discuss it with everyone so that they understand the benefit of doing so as well.  This is what in my mind will eventually bring about the true potential of the peaceful revolution that Bitcoin makes possible and allow humankind to take our next evolutionary leap into the future :-)

@_date: 2019-01-08 15:17:42
Exactly this. Everyone should understand that having regulated financial firms store your BTC is every exchanges goal. By doing so they can control / manipulate the price. Holding your own keys every time regardless of how much you own is essential for bitcoins success! 
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:14:36

This may be an oversimplification but I have a hard time seeing how a few hundred million of tether can manipulate bitcoins value by tens of billions of dollars. Just sayin 
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:14:22
Supply and demand determines value. If they have the largest supply and an exchange to boot the possibilities are endless. Remember the stories about how gold certificates by the "bank" outnumbered the actual amount of gold in the vault? Yeah well that's just one possibility when having bitcoin banks. What about another manipulation tactic where bots owned by the same organization just sell for whatever price to each other to take the price up down or keep it sideways. All of these scenarios are possible when they control the largest wallets in the world regardless of mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:14:58
I definitely agree with your dollar cost averaging approach. I just think that in order to allow bitcoin to achieve price discovery at its natural pace we as a community need to collectively take the actions described in my original post. Otherwise we'll be at the behest of big money / govt control via exchanges / Wall St. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:47:40
Until we all take possession of our private keys the banks will continue to manipulate the price as they see fit via their exchanges, OTC markets and futures

Amazing how Goldman seemed to call a top a few weeks ago. Makes you wonder if this is all related. Hmm I wonder. Either way I'm definitely not concerned and will continue to DCA.  They may be able to manipulate the price while they still control most on and off ramps for the masses. However as long as decentralization is maintained, scalability continues, and adoptions increases their days of being relevant are numbered. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:31:08
I guess this is really a long term win win regardless of whether they manipulate the price in the short term for the people. If they (GS et al) succeed then the real long term believers / holders will scoop up additional coins that they (GS et al) will never control. Over time people will become wise to these tactics and when the real turning point to BTC finally happens they (banksters) will be left in the history books! Dollar cost average and hodl people! The only reason fiat still matters is because the banks still control the on / off ramps to BTC for the masses. Once mass adoption occurs  (perhaps with lightning), they can manipulate away the price in fiat. We'll just trade btc amongst ourselves for what we believe it's worth for goods and services.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:36:46
The idea is that by storing them at addresses that you control and the exchanges do not removes the possibility of the exchanges "borrowing" your coins without your consent. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:54:27
The reality is that nobody in the world can predict the price. The increase in price will strictly be determined by the amount of people who decide to hold their own keys off exchanges and dollar cost average to break free from the bank backed exchanges control over the price. I belive its extremely important for all of us to talk about this to our family and friends and educate them about how they can safely control their own keys. Once we hit critical mass the moon isn't even the limit!

Hey bud, the we I was referring to are the everyday people who are getting stuck paying all the taxes, not getting inflationary raises and seeing our purchase power being decimated by the ellite few who are running this shit show. Bitcoin is (as best I can see it ) the best vehicle to help us rein in their insanity so from that context there is a we. Maybe you don't fall into that catagorey and if not then congratulations!

Also, with respect to the exponential growth worldwide being a figment of my imagination, what about how  Australia recently recognized it as a form of payment and Japan brought on 100s of thousands of retailers to accept it.  Also now and that Segwit is officially being implemented and lightning on the way, worldwide adoption is a lot closer than people realize IMO.

Hodlers hoard crypto and there's plenty that are not from the good ol boy network and are generally altruistic people that want to change this fiat ruled world for the better. Most would never sell all of their btc regardless of how low or high its fiat currency value goes. As more and more people become informed Hodlers, the tides will turn and fiat will slide and btc will rise. For the first time in a long time I'm actually optimistic about the future because of bitcoin and other blockchain projects that it's spawned. What an incredible time to exist!

Hello, what I'm trying to say is that there should be a relatively straight forward way for users to confirm with certainty that they are the owners of private keys where bitcoins are stored without spending from their addresses. I understand that there are standardized ways to sign / verify bitcoin messages from legacy addresses however outside of spending the bitcoin from the address there is no way that I'm aware of to confirm ownership of the private keys and wallet manufacturers seem to be not prioritizing the implementation of a straight forward way for users to sign / verify which to me makes no sense. 
I also understand that native Segwit addresses have not had a standardized way developed yet for signing / verifying bitcoin messages and I'm not sure exactly why that would be given the fact that this upgrade was so important to L2 and how proving ownership of the private keys is vital to the users own financial independence.  
I mean after all if the vast majority of people are non coders who are trusting these wallets with their private keys, how would they know they actually own their keys and the wallets aren't just all part of a centralized database spending their BTC for them when they initiate a transaction? 
In my opinion it's imperative that we as a community let it be known that we need this functionality implemented asap across all wallets in a peer reviewed standardized way for all address formats. Otherwise unless you're the most brilliant coder in the world with unlimited time to independently review the code of your wallets then there's no way to know that you actually have your private keys.  Plus ironically (or not perhaps) the vast majority of the wallets connect to their own nodes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:07:24
Agreed regarding storing coins online. I think one should always store their own coins. Regardless whether the exchange is centralized or decentralized. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:56:32
What I'm asking is how would one confirm one is in possession of the private keys on a Segwit address if not for message signing /verification? With legacy addresses you could simple write a message, then sign that message with the private key then anyone you send that message to could verify with absolute certainty that the author of the message had physical possession of the private key at that address.  Without this function I don't know how one would prove ownership of their private keys that contain their bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:49:20
Bitcoin, although complex with its learning curve at this early stage, is all about removing third parties from the equation. Having third party custody solutions is detrimental IMO as it allows these entities to control and manipulate the price of bitcoin (aka financialization /paper bitcoin etc).
We as a community need a grass roots movement to educate our friends and family about the history of fiat currency, why bitcoin is better, and how to take physical possession of their private keys in a safe way that can be confirmed via bitcoin message signatures.  Once the collective light bulb goes off and people understand this on any scale then is when we will see bitcoin really take off.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:31:39
I have a few questions /comments about Segwit. From what I understand there has been no standardizeed message signing / verification developed for these address types. If this is in fact true, and message signing /verification is the only way to know with certainty that you are in physical possession of you private keys, then it seems to me you are absolutely depending on the wallet and have no independent way of confirming it's not just a centralized database. Especially when considering how most wallets that use Segwit don't let you connect to your own node. Any comments here would be very much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:06:35
Thank you for that information! Do you know of any other ways beyond message signing / verification that the individual user can perform to confirm that they do in fact possess the private keys to the addresses that contain the bitcoin outside of moving the actual bitcoin? Thanks in advance!

@_date: 2019-09-19 13:36:29
Yes but unfortunately the signing / verifying function doesn't seem to be implemented consistently across wallets. I mean case in point was last week when I signed a message from mycelium from a standard address then tried to verify the message with the bither wallet. Both wallets were recommended by bitcoin dot org and both were running on Android devices. Furthernore the address that signed the message was a legacy adddres but it wouldn't verify on bither.
Plus, why isn't there a standardized signing method for native Segwit addresses by now if it's so important for the network? I mean if it's that difficult or impossible to do then maybe it's not the answer after all. But I'm not a coder so I have no idea here. I'm just saying that giving up message signing for any upgrade is not worth the loss of financial autonomy.

1) Selected a legacy Bitcoin address in mycelium to sign a message with.
2) typed hi in the message field all lower case and no space at the end
3) created the signature.
4) downloaded and installed bither
5) put the appropriate address, message, and signature in the verify message fields.
6) received error that it was not a valid signature
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:28:11
Agree with this 100%! Although be sure to move them to addresses and wallets which allow you to sign and verify bitcoin messages to prove that you actually have custody of the private keys!
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:52:48
Thank you for your clarification however I'm concerned as it would seem there's no way for an average user who doesn't understand code to prove ownership of a Segwit Bitcoin address anymore without making a transaction. Prior to segwit you could do so with message sigining /verification. Coupling this with the majority of the wallets today not allowing you to specify your own node this seems problematic.

Wait, I'm certainly not mathematically gifted, but in just thinking about pushing 2 to the 256 input possibilities through a 2 to the 160 possible output function seems like  there would be a substantial amount of duplicate addresses (collisions ?) . I mean am I missing something here? (I hope I'm missing something here) Why wouldn't we want to push it through a one way function with at least the same amount of possible outputs as the inputs preferably one with many more output options as the input to at least minimize the likelihood of duplicate addresses occurring.

I don't see this working out . I would imagine most people here aren't interested in selling our bitcoin to the one percenters. I would however imagine some folks will sell some once they can do so by only divesting a small amount of their bitcoin holdings and live comfortably on those profits for the rest of their lives. Maybe try again at 1,000,000 per coin. Maybe I'll sell you some then. ;)

So, does anyone else think these otc trades are bad?  I mean we have cash settled futures regulated by the  SEC for bitcoin on unregulated trading markets that whales and big money already had an advantage.  Now when the whales finally capitulate and buy in they can do so off of the regular markets? Absolutely BS!  How the hell are these SEC regulated futures determining the value of bitcoin and whether these products are in , at or out the money?  Are they going to go based on these markets that only small time mom and pop investors can trade on?  I mean it big money is doing block trades (otc) then it won't change the exchange rates at all.  We're all waiting here counting the days that the big money capitulate but with this bs it seems it's not going to be anytime soon.  I guess we'll have to wait for decentralized,  open source exchanges to take hold and atomic swaps.

Commingling.  This exchange is backed heavily by the banks (like all other major exchanges). Don't you find that odd? Fiat currency producers heavily investing in the gateways for the masses to exit the fiat currency system?  There can only be one reason in my opinion and that is to control the price of bitcoin and therefore slow down or stop mass adoption to cling on to their fleeting power over humanity. Fortunately I believe that word is getting out and more and more people are dollar cost averaging and HODLing their Bitcoin in their own wallets. These attempts will only let them control it for so long. After all this is the first truly finite commodity and Main St has beaten Wall Street to the party ;) 
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:42:54
When exchanges backed by Banks hold the largest Bitcoin wallets they have both the means and motive to suppress the price of bitcoin. We all need to get every single Satoshi off of them asap into addresses we control!  Otherwise they will continue playing these Financialization games with bitcoin and controlling the price. Remember it matters not about mass adoption if people just buy the coins and leave them on these exchanges backed by the banks. They can use multiple tactics to crush the price until everyone takes their BTC off of them. That's when bitcoin will soar! 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:05:02
Some of the main reasons that Bitcoin is viable is because of the following:
- it's the first Truly finite asset with a soon to be inflation rate less than gold. 
- anyone can validate the amount of Bitcoin and location of bitcoin anywhere  independently of any organization.
By running a node you not only strengthen the Bitcoin network via node authentication of the rules of consensus and decentralization, but you also have the means to perform the second item above.  You can even point your own wallets to your own node for the ultimate in self sovereignty which is what Bitcoin is all about! 
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:09:06
I agree with everything the OP wrote except for the last sentence. We should not return these bitcoins to exchanges but HODL your own private keys unless you absolutely need to sell them. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:49:42

Mass adoption of bitcoin is good for humanity as a whole! Mass adoption is dependent on price appreciation. Price appreciation is dependent on people organizing and prying away OUR bitcoin from the legacy financial system which has a vested interest in suppression of the price and mass adoption due to the fact that their relavancy is inversely proportional to bitcoins level of mass adoption.

The major investors in these exchanges which hold these coins (that is the largest tradable Supply in the world) are the banks. Banks do not want Bitcoin to succeed and therefore immediately a huge conflict of interest that arises. These exchanges also have apis which allow Bots to interface with these exchanges that opens up many opportunities for Price manipulation to occur by organizations having multiple Bots integrate with these apis and selling back and forth to each other at whatever value they determine appropriate at that time. Additionally there is a very long history about Wall Street manipulating prices in Commodities through very underhanded techniques many of which were explained very well by Ms Caitlin Long a few months ago via Forbes that I highly suggest people read.

Let alone that it is more portable and verifiable by anybody anywhere anytime that wants to run a node. Bitcoin is trustless central banks require trust. You can't undo this revolution!

If that's true then considering there's only ~17.7 million Bitcoin ever mined and anywhere from 2-5 million lost forever, this means between 2.2 - 5.2 million bitcoins that are being traded and creating the financialization of bitcoin (paper bitcoins, rehypothification, bitcoin IOUs etc) . Can you imagine how few people it will take to simply move their Bitcoin to their own wallets to break legacy Wall Street's grip on the price? Coupling this with the ever growing group of people who continue to dollar cost average and HODL their own keys this is should be about to take off IMO to somewhere that even makes the moon look insignificant!

Actually, IMO no amount should be left on these exchanges. Think about how many people think the same way you do and how quickly that would add up!

Assessing the Efficacy of Bitcoin Independence Day:
All, a few things occurred to me which I believe may be something of interest to the community.  The simple realization that if this movement gains enough traction (which I believe it will) then the UTXO set size should theoretically increase as more private keys are repatriated from exchanges into wallets that individuals control while the main wallet addresses of exchanges should decrease linearly. As is widely believed in the community, most major exchanges large addresses are known and therefore if Proof of Keys / Proof of Trust / Bitcoin Independence Day is successful then there should be a way to see these addresses decreasing in BTC value coupled with an increasing size of the UTXO set (if I understand the UTXO set correctly that is). Any feedback is much appreciated here.

These exchanges are toast and need to be to allow for bitcoin to blossom IMO. How can these bank backed exchanges actually want bitcoin to be successful if it means their largest investors become irrelevant?  I believe the banks invested in a last ditch attempt to control the USD price of bitcoin relying on the masses ignorance who just left it in "their" exchange wallets. Looks like this game has about run its course. Looking forward to snapping the chains off our bitcoin in the not too distant future!

The reason I brought this up was so that we could enlighten folks to a way to gage the effectiveness of the movement which I believe to be very important. How else (aside reading a bunch of posts from anonymous redfitors) would we know? It's my hope this analysis will empower people who may not of thought of it otherwise.

One concern I have is that people that don't own a substantial amount of Bitcoin think that their small amount doesn't matter. This is extremely dangerous thinking especially considering that the vast majority of holders actually have small amounts and store them on the exchanges which cumulatively add up to substantial sums that will allow these exchanges to continue to play their manipulative games. Everyone who has any amount of Bitcoin really should participate in this event! For it to be truly successful we all need to not only move these  to wallets that we control, but also to continue to dollar cost average and then immediately move it into our own wallets ASAP!

The goal should be for everyone to have their keys by January 3rd. Not everyone to withdraw at that time!  Also the goal should be to create a culture of permanently holding your own private keys and make it a best practice for every single purchase every time. Every single Satoshi off these exchanges every time!  Think about how many people say.. I only have a few dollars worth of bitcoin so my small amount doesn't matter.  Wrong! If you added all of those people up you start to appreciate that the cumulative effect of this mentality is devastating as it gives these bank backed exchanges power to control world's largest Bitcoin wallets and hence the price of bitcoin! It's imperative that we speak to our family and friends and fellow community members about the urgency of removing all of Bitcoin off of these exchanges as soon as possible regardless of how much (or little) they own.  This is our opportunity to take the power back from these Legacy financial institutions that have obvious conflict of interest with respect to Bitcoin's success!  Let's make this happen!

Thank you!

Absolutely! This is exactly what bitcoin is supposed to be all about! The sovereign individual!  These shady exchanges are backed by the banks and are holding on to the largest wallets in the world due people not moving them. I feel certain they have created a huge amount of paper bitcoins through rehypothifacation etc. This act you propose would allow us as citizens of the world to retake control of our currency and value it as WE see fit and not these bank backed exchanges.  If these exchanges fail then they absolutely deserve to and I belive this would be a huge net positive for bitcoin and the people of the world! What a great time to take it back on such a historic day!  One thing I'd like to add though. I think that rather than everyone trying this all at the same time we should perhaps try to make it a goal to have all of our coins off these exchanges by that date.  Either way I applaud you for this as I have been advocating this for quite a while now but haven't been able to put it so eloquently!  Thank you!  We should all share this idea on all other social media platforms as well to get this idea out there for the 10 year bitcoin anniversary!

Lol hilarious. It's like they're saying (as politely as possible) FU!

Congratulations on your purchase! Just remember to move them immediately off the exchange into addresses that you control. Otherwise they're not your Bitcoins but rather just numbers in a bank backed exchanges' database. It's critical that people understand this otherwise these exchanges (funded by the enemy of bitcoin) can control the price of bitcoin indefinitely as they will hold the largest wallets in the world.

This movement is about making it impossible to financialize bitcoin via rehypothification / comingling etc. Dollar cost averaging HODLers that store their own bitcoin keys will allow us to break the world's first truly finite asset free from the grips of Wall Street and traditional finance with a true supply demand profile unlike anything in history!   All we have to do is educate a small percentage of the 7.5 billion people of these facts and we will win. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 06:12:00
Agree with everything except for the last sentence which implies this is a temporary exercise. This must be permanent for us to pry bitcoin free from the legacy financial system and allow bitcoins supply and demand profile to take over. Buyers must move every single Satoshi every single time to wallets they control!

DCA and HODLing in wallets that you control (off exchanges) is the only way to go. It's my hope that when people speak about mass adoption they realize that unless they take their BTC off the exchanges then they are essentially giving these exchanges the largest tradable bitcoin supply in the world. Isn't it odd that coinbase, Binance and all the other exchanges don't give you the bitcoin addresses your funds are associated with? Perhaps these a reason?  (cough commingling). Unless we get the word out to the masses that these bank backed exchanges have both the motive and means to see bitcoins price artificially restrained (via their customers deposits) and that moving your Satoshis immediately into wallets you control is equally as important as buying, then you can rest assured that they will continue to control the price of bitcoin.

Banks / Wall St are the biggest investors in most (if not all) of the major crypto exchanges. These same organizations create two markets for trading OTC {over the counter) and then the regular exchange that the majority of people use. OTC is used for high networth individuals to buy and sell without affecting the regular markets (aka masking the true supply and demand aspect of the market). Additionally what these organizations are depending on is the fact that people think that they are buying Bitcoin when in fact all they are getting for their fiat currency are just  numbers in the databases that these exchanges control. Until the individual actually pulls this cryptocurrency off of The Exchange into wallets they control they do not actually own any Bitcoin at all. Just a promise that the exchange will supplied if requested via transfer out. In the meantime there's no reason to believe that these exchanges (again which are again backed by Banks - aka the antithesis of bitcoin) wouldn't be doing all kinds of nefarious tricks to restrain the price of Bitcoin. Especially when its so in your face about the two different markets etcetera. Anyway it's my opinion that in order to eliminate the potential for price manipulation and control of the price of Bitcoin expressed in fiat currency that we as a community take our crypto into our own hands to be able to make sure that they cannot continue to restrain the price. Until people do this in en masse then I believe that the price will continue to be manipulated.   Considering that they're only 17.4 million Bitcoin that exist at this time how many people do you really think it would require to dollar cost average and hold off any centralized exchange to truly move the price in the natural direction of upwards? I think it's a lot less than you would imagine.

Thank you very much!  :)

Thank you but that still doesn't allow me to sign messages with the legacy address nor do I see any transaction history from it. Also as mentioned in my other post, what if I wanted to import other legacy address paper wallets with balances? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:44:31
Just remember, do not leave your bitcoin on these bank backed exchanges. Otherwise we will never have a free market and the supply and demand profile that gives bitcoin value is meaningless as they will continue to have the world's largest wallets.
