The theatres are scared of terrorist attacks on the theatres themselves, they are the ones that pulled the movie from being released - it was not Sony's call. 
I believe that they will be pirated no matter what, but majority people in the Bitcoin community are great people and will do what is right.

Get a fucking life and stop spreading this negative bullshit.

Why can't this sort of stuff make headline news rather than all the other BS we see on TV. The kid did his homework according to the instructions given and the teacher gives him an incomplete? This should bring some attention to education and how foolish that teacher is. 
I would like to send you / your son $10 in BTC if you can post your address here.
Good luck and give them hell at the parent teacher conference.  Maybe you just print (yes print) this entire thread and have the teacher read it.

They removed it from the app store but if you have it installed already you don't have to worry. If your phone gets reset you will lose the app + bitcoin if you don't have a backup.

I have a feeling PayPal is going to control the wallets and allow chargebacks. Not the point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:31:06
What about this:
I have an ANXBtc DEBIT CARD, connect it to my Apple Pay and use "Bitcoin" everywhere mastercard is accepted.
Should be interesting.. I am still waiting for my card to come in the mail.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:53:41
Secondary password is a MUST. If someone attempts to send coins from your wallet they have to type the secondary password. 
3 levels of security:
1. Strong password (100+ characters)
2. 2FA
3. Second password
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:18:35
Well that's a bit of a stretch. Bitpay is NOT the only one that can handle this, you can have multiple processors. That should be the least of worries.
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:01:16
Most definitely an unnecessary amount - 2.5% to load up the card + CC fees (~3%). Just looking at this as the bigger picture.
You can "technical" integrate paying with BTC (with fees) through Apple Pay.

The Sony CEO has stated that they would like the US to see this movie and  said that they are working on releasing it on a different platform. That is what struck this "idea".

Not looking for them to consider, but why wouldn't this be considered for a crazy event like this. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:31:36
Agreed! Would be very cool and would cause conversation around the movie industry.

Cold storage. Offline computer that is running the Linux and it is stored in a safe inside your house or somewhere very secure and you can have the address available so that anybody that sends money to that address it will automatically go to cold storage and the only way to spend money from that is to use a USB drive to transact via your life computer. Obviously the live computer should not have any private keys on all of the private keys are on your off-line laptop. You are using the USB stick to sign the transaction and then you broadcast it through the live computer.

Ribbit.me is working on a decentralized Rewards program.

Correct. Is there something wrong with that? 
After hearing the Microsoft news, is it really that far fetched?

I highly recommend Cafe Berlin in Vegas!!! They accept Bitcoin and they hold bitcoin!!

AHh damn - sorry, yea the shipping is expensive. Well I hope you get a great pair of socks. sooonnn!!!!
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:52:13
I disagree hahaha. I am sure you are wearing a pair right now! (maybe?) :)

I have been experience very similar issues with the RBR that I have in limbo in my account. After going back and forth with Karen, they left me hanging for 15 days. I was constantly checking in every 2-3 days and received no responses. I was fed up with the wait and I opened a new ticket, once I did that I received a response from Karen that they had to take the wallet down completely. She did not specify how long it would take, since then I have tried contacting again and there are no responses. I have 2 personal emails and I reached out to those 2 people as well, no response. 
Horrible experience and I am very uncertain that I will ever get my money back. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:59:21
That's awesome! Looking forward to the proposal.

How about offering to tip 30% at a restaurant if they decide to accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:49:42
I have a small amount of Bitcoin in my Inputs.io account - I have all of the necessary security features enabled. I don't see a message that it was hacked or anything. 
Anyone else having issues?
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:10:08
Maybe we should all email the shopify crew and CC Bitpay on there? :) 
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:09:11
Previously there were rumors that Bitpay was looking into it, but I am not sure where that stands. I am guessing they would be the first to legitimately integrate because they have their shit together and can probably scale the shitload of transactions that go through shopify. 
Hope that it happens soon. Very soon!
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:53:37
Awesome! Hopefully more people do the same :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:20:40
The forms are BS. Hopefully they can authenticate/verify differently. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:33:16
Sending bitcoins would be much faster and more secure than submitting or storing credit card information on their servers. Also it would save them transaction fee dollars. Bitcoin is much better all around! Cheers.

You can try  - not an amazon selection, but they have a lot of good stuff.

I am using Chase + Ally Bank and I have not had any issue thus far. Although my transactions aren't huge, but I have yet to receive a call and/or email from either. I am not a PRIVATE CLIENT at Chase, just a regular Joe.
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:20:10
Well that explains why they never got anywhere! I think it would be a great place to pick up, but I agree with the forms/signatures/etc. Someone needs to simplify the process. Coinbase has a nice verification process in place right now. Hopefully something comes up soon, I don't want to convert to USD :(
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:08:23
I personally think it's going to be Bitpay, but you never know what Coinbase has up their sleeve :) - either way that's a big market share for the e-commerce world.

I need something in the US that will allow me to pay bills with Bitcoin...anyone??
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:12:48
Did you show them a Bitcoin QR code and tell them that Bitcoin is taking over? Oh yeah don't forget to tell to fuck themselves!
 
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:54:37
Yes I would like to know that as well. I am guessing use coinbase/bitpay and send the money directly to the account once it is sent to the address?
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:22:23
I have API access disabled. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:30:53
I am on 7.0.3 as well (latest version) - when you delete/reinstall the app, try creating a new account through the app, not pairing (that is still an issue with the app). I had to create a new account through the app and configure it on the web. Best of luck. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:53:19
Can you send me your proposal and maybe I can make some changes and send it to my head office?
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:19:58
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:08:21
Suggestion: 
One person should set up a bitcoin address and have people pledge 100$ each in bitcoin and show it to subway and let them know that they can have their money upfront. Do a donation button or something via Coinbase. 
This might be the best way to have them convert over. 
Work out the details later regarding the money, just give them an incentive. :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:15:18
Thank you for sharing.. wasn't aware of that.
You have been using them for 3 months and always pay them directly with Bitcoin? (just confirming)
I don't understand why they do not advertise Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:32:26
I had a similar issues before the update with my existing wallets and not being able to sync them to my phone. Continously told me that my wallet was not decrypting (I believe 2FA causes this issue if you setup the wallet on your computer rather than directly on your phone). 
Best solution is to create a wallet on the blockchain app directly (make sure you have a SECURE password) and then go on the web and login + setup your security (2FA) directly on the web. It worked for me, it never had me reset anything on my iOS device.
**Note if you logout of your blockchain wallet after setting up on the web, you may run into the same issue***
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:18:21
Just did. Thanks again.. much appreciate.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:55:20
Ryan, thank you for chiming in on this. I just signed up with you guys yesterday and I am in touch with your support team.

Unfortunately I am not located in the Silicon Valley Area anymore, but I will donate my portion if neeeded.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:43:47
HAHAH! They are all fucking douche bags. You should send them a check and tape a QR code on there and tell them if they can figure out how to use Bitcoin they have $1000 waiting for them.
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:58:37
I just signed up, sort of excited for this...
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:37:15
Good luck and keep us posted on how the sales do after adopting Bitcoin!

You may want to try talking with the Bitpay team -  they integrate with majority of the e-commerce platforms. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:53:22
It is an instant process, as someone stated FOODLER actually credits your account immediately using Bitcoin without ANY confirmations. I agree it will take time for people to adapt, but it's way more secure than a credit card transaction + storing credit card information on their servers is not the best solution.
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:20:06
PayPal is anti-bitcoin. What did you think was going to happen? + giving them all the proof that the other party received Bitcoins probably gives them more of a reason to reject the payment and reverse the charges. Think before you do something stupid like that again.
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:29:10
Feel free to send them an email! Let's make it happen :)

He is here to help change the world! One bitcoin at a time...
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:35:24
That is unfortunate! From my understanding there have been close friends that have had their PayPal account frozen due to Bitcoin activity. Emails saying, we can no longer do business with you due to the affiliation with Bitcoin, etc... (I will try to get them to send me the email). Hopefully I am wrong, but I guess it makes sense with the "Digital Goods" clause.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:24:01
Set up an offline laptop (that has never/will never touch the internet), remove private keys from your "online" laptop and only store private keys on your "offline" laptop. 
I don't want to go into the full detail, but here is a good place to start:

Hope that helps with your security.
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:42:00
Try deleting the app and reinstalling. It worked for me. Make sure you are selecting "Forget Account Details" I just did it 2 mins ago and it worked fine. It might be an issue with the app, reinstalling fixes the issue. Let me know if you run into issues. I believe that blockchain is afraid update the app because Apple will flag it &amp; remove it completely, which would SUCK. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:58:38
Awesome thank you so much!
I am trying to figure out their backend, seems like most of it is made for the Manager/Owners not the renters.
If you have any tips that would be great. Cheers!
