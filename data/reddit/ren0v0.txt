Just replace wallet.dat and run with -rescan I believe. I switch wallets all the time by switching out the wallet with no need to rescan though, I think that just depends on if you've made a transaction using the keys and another method other than bitcoin core.
Edit: re-read your post and not entirely sure what you are trying to do but if you want to reindex chain run with -reindex

This is actually awful if it provides a mechanism of users funds to be traced in the blockchain which seems like it will be the case

No, bittylicious is p2p not an exchange.

Im assuming he meant easy to fill blocks up not implement a block size change.

You don't need 'big money' to fork bitcoin and you can't replicate bitcoins network overnights, sorry to disappoint.

No actual BTC changes hands on these trades its just paper btc that may or may not not be backed by some coin from knc

And this is why  continues not to include them after all this time. I don't see how these exchanges are turning a profit, this along with 0% fees makes for an interesting conspiracy

That's what he said

Not as quick as 
Two years slower in fact...
Also they only seem to be using one data source so its not even an index

Don't ask for investment advice on reddit. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose in anything. Good luck

This, everyone complains but if you want longevity in this game then they need to follow the rules, as shitty as they may be

I for one am moving funds out of Bitfinex and I know many others who are doing the same. The dad thing is there aren't that many other good options.
Bitstamp has always been there for me but they don't offer margin trading which is quite a large drawback. Think it's time for me to try kraken

No, even if his email was compromised the attacker still needed to compromise his device to gain 2fa keys. Likely he would have used the same method for 2fa on gmail anyway so that would be pointless

It's not major news, this has been around for years in terms of other OTC markets and trust systems.
One could argue this is worse seeing as you don't have any info on the broker?
Have you really never heard of bittylicious, bitbargain and others? I'm all for more markets but please don't claim this is something new when they've just copied an existing model.

Why the hell is an iPhone considered more secure than a computer'?? This is such false advice.
Just create a livecd and go from there with bitcoin core

Is i t really that bad in the US to own a home? It's a great asset elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-10-04 06:51:44
Or just use bitcoin core, dump the priv key and print or store however you like
There are lots of other options but I don't see what's wrong with the original
