Segshit ain't gonna fly
When Roger walks in with an itty-bitty waist and a finger in your face
You get sprung
Wanna fork out tough
Cause you noticed those blocks are stuffed
Not like Satoshi's vision
And Segwit's just a regression
Oh Blockstream I don't wanna be wit'cha
Cause I'm gonna get richer
Your miners tried to scorn me cause Bcash just sounds s-s-so corny
EDIT: Come on people, have some humor, I'm really not picking sides here :P

Now prepare to keep seeing this come up in the coming weeks:

Why is Monero on the left?

I highly doubt this is true.
I've been active on LocalBitcoins in Japan. I've attempted blockchain and Bitcoin-related meetups in Tokyo and made friends in the community. I've casually checked out the exchanges.
The only way this is true is if the vast majority of the volume is by a very small group of whales and/or HFT:ers.

Definitely inaccurate. But if they would have written "The web" instead, it seems reasonable.
The "World Wide Web" was conjured in 1989 and Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first browser in 1990.

free if you're doing it in a healthy way. Unless the costs you're referring to are accessories for whatever kink you have.

You're thinking of the lunar new year, a.k.a. Chinese New Year.

Would you mind elaborating on the tax nightmares? Seeing as e.g. BIC Camera have been accepting BTC payments for some time now.

You can't really argue that when you have built a frontend displaying metadata and information like names, denominations, etc in a dropdown menu. Maybe it could be argued differently if he only wrote and deployed the smart contract and had zero involvement in the environment after. I doubt that it would fly though, torrent tracker admins have been jailed before.

It's "centralized" in that the orderbook is stored in a single smart contract, but not in the sense that EtherDelta is hosting orderbooks or relaying orders through any service.
At least that was the case when Coburn was still involved with EtherDelta (he sold it in November last year and this charge is refering to the time he was still receiving trading fees, ending December 2017).

Does this qualify?

Well if you don't, then don't use their services to transfer large amounts of funds and the complain when you don't comply to rules and regulations that they are bound to follow. You can't eat your cake and have it too.

"Inefficient" does not equal "bad".

 has minute-by-minute order book snapshots and trade history.
I already put this as a comment at your post in but putting it here for others. :)
Full disclosure: I work at Kaiko.

Gold is, an ounce of gold is not, which is the point of the original comment.

According to the article, only deposits/withdrawals will be suspended - not trading.

It'd be enough to publish the public key and a corresponding signature. No need to leak private keys to prove ownership of an address.

Maybe do your own research beyond going by hearsay and Reddit comments by randoms. Whitepaper should be mandatory reading. It's totally fine if you don't of course, but don't echo opinions you read or hear as if they are facts if you don't know what to believe.
Andreas Antopolous is a loved thought-leader and I'd recommend his book, it's a great deeper intro, and also his YouTube channel and podcast. Also The Bitcoin standard by Saifedean Ammous.
What Bitcoin Did and Laura Shin's Unchained and Unconfirmed are also great podcasts (the latter two not Bitcoin-centric).

Quantum computers are not faster in the general case. There are however a set of algorithms that can be computed fundamentally more efficciently in a quantum computational model. No known way to leverage this to break sha256.

That's just, like, your opinion, man. The title of the Bitcoin whitepaper is literally "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and very much a core intended use case and motivation. Your opinion is not shared by most people in the BTC community either.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:24:28
I did the same thing :)
