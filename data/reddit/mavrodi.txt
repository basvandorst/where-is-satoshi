You neglected to mention the popular-in-China pyramid scheme MMM, which requires participants to buy Bitcoins in the first place. You can directly correlate rising popularity of MMM with rising Bitcoin exchange volume in Russia, Brazil, and China. A quick pump-and-dump price surge makes sense with this type of scheme as well. 
I'm not sure if you simply hadn't heard of this or were ignoring it on purpose but this ponzi scheme is mentioned in several recent articles talking about the bitcoin price surge

Even though they specifically stated they won't take Bitcoins...

China represents 80+% of Bitcoin volume and a majority of the mining infrastructure. Western markets follow China's exchanges because that's where the significant volume is.

You're claiming that this "manipulation" (which is indistinguishable from regular use of Bitcoins by, say, a company) is coming from somebody who doesn't want Bitcoin to succeed - but how can it possibly succeed if you can't even honestly use the system without being accused of sabotaging or spamming or attacking? 
Don't you see the problem here? People are encouraged to use Bitcoins and then if a company actually needed it for 5 tps business they would be accused of spamming. 
To put it differently - why do you think people who need to use Bitcoin for high-tps reasons and people who want Bitcoin to succeed are exclusive of each other?

You need a new bitcoin-capable terminal, yet to be released.

If a video game accepted Bitcoin as a method of payment, used multisig transactions and stored reputation points but did both of those on a seperate and private no-fee chain, is that still a Bitcoin project?

Not really? There are times when one dips and the other rises but also many occurrences where both rise or dip concurrently.

You can easily double-spend your money by submitting a new transaction with a much higher fee. This new transaction will confirm first, probably.

But Bitcoin has already been separated from blockchains, there are several non-bitcoin working blockchains both in existence and in progress. NASDAQ isn't using the Bitcoin blockchain, for example

Who are you to ask? Who is anybody? Is this not an open-source platform? 


Again, do you see how ludicrous it is of you to attempt to police the Blockchain and its use? Who are they? What to they want with it? Who cares, and why do we need to verify this stuff before allowing use? 


But until that time we will demand to know who uses the blockchain, for what, to judge whether their use is some arbitrary notion of valid or not?

...but then you attributed any possible manipulation to somebody who doesn't want Bitcoin to succeed, which is the same as saying that anybody using it too much fits in that category by "manipulating" the currency.

Are you saying that somebody excessively using Bitcoin doesn't want it to succeed?

The fact that an actual literal pyramid scheme forced people to buy Bitcoin causing a rally that left others FOMO buying at $500 and left holding the bag now doesn't help, either.

Not Bitcoins.
