That's probably true, although it's always possible the OS shuffled the pages around in physical RAM at that particular moment, leaving a copy hanging around elsewhere. OpenSSL_cleanse is only concerned with *software* accessibility of the keys.

You need to understand what's happening here - your Electrum seed is no easier to guess than your private key itself. They're both just very large numbers, but Electrum happens to display its in base 1600 (where each word is a "digit"). 
Representing it this way doesn't make it any easier to guess - you might as well worry about somebody stumbling across your wallet's private key by trying every key starting with "0000000000000...1" and going up from there. It's just not going to happen.

This is a typical problem in finance, and the solution is well-known: offload the risk to somebody else using futures contracts. Bitcoin needs a liquid derivatives market; one will develop sooner or later, and the exchange rate issue will just disappear.

Software sees logical pages. The OS maps these to physical RAM locations, and that mapping may change transparently to the userland code at any time (either it is swapped out and later back in somewhere else, or the OS reorganized the logical pages for its own purposes). Your pointer still points to 0x12345678, but that now corresponds to an entirely different physical location in RAM. 
This is (part of) the point of a CPU's MMU, and if it wasn't happening memory fragmentation would be a major issue.

Yes, it's annoying, but your gains were going to be taxed one way or another. Treating it as a currency would have been worse, because then you'd be required to pay taxes on your *unrealized* gains (as regular income!) every year.

This argument doesn't hold up, because liquidity is a two-sided coin. If Amazon is suddenly dumping tons of BTC on the exchanges, then tons of people must also be buying on the exchanges, to get the BTC to spend on Amazon in the first place. They're not operating in a vacuum. 
If not, and people are just spending coins they already had, then yes - the exchange rate will go down to compensate. Which is to be expected, because people are essentially dumping their Bitcoins.


Then you'd see an imbalance in the other direction and the exchange rate would go up. 
This isn't anything new - companies don't expose themselves to foreign currency risk in general. Global forex volume is many times higher than global GDP, because converting foreign currency (which Bitcoin essentially is) to local currency is a normal part of doing business internationally. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:56:43
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:46:14
So what you're saying is that people will be selling/using more BTC than they are buying. So the exchange rate will go down, as it should under such circumstances. If it goes too low (as defined by the market, which knows better than you or I), new buyers will come in and drive the price back up. 
What's the problem exactly?

They are as secure as any other address. You didn't create the whole thing, you guessed random ones until a few bits at the beginning matched. 
That is, you stumbled upon 1helloxxxxxxxxxxxx. If you did it again, next time it would be 1helloyyyyyyyyyyyyyy - an entirely different key. It's just as difficult for an attacker to recover as a fully random key.
EDIT: ok, not *quite* as difficult, because the key space is a bit smaller. But still way out of the question: the work you do generating it + the work the attacker needs to do to find it = the amount of work it would take to find a fully random key. Splitting the work between you and the attacker doesn't make it any easier.

Nothing "went wrong" - this is normal (albeit extremely volatile) market behavior. When everybody is in agreement that the price will go up from here, that means everybody has already bought in and there's no more money coming to drive it higher. That's the top (at least for the short term).
When everybody is pessimistic, that's when upswings begin. Price goes up when people move from the pessimistic column to the optimistic column, not when they're all already there.

No I'm not - transactions require liquidity, which means a certain valuation/float available for purchase on the market. More concurrent transactions directly necessitate a higher valuation of the BTC available, just from a simple accounting standpoint: you can't send $1b worth of BTC without buying it first. This takes it out of circulation for everybody else in the meantime. The more people doing this, the more dollars fighting for (perhaps temporary) ownership of any given Bitcoin.

It's not because of capitalism, it's because of our debt-based monetary system.

@_date: 2015-11-04 16:45:35
Price matters for a number of reasons, but the biggest is that the utility of Bitcoin is directly related to the market cap - higher value means more liquidity available for transactions. It can't possibly be widely used if the entire system can only store $7B worth of value. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:07:30


It's mathematically guaranteed. Since all money is created as debt, you must create more money in the future to cover the interest+principal on existing debt. If the money supply is shrinking, that means the system as a whole cannot cover its debts. When that happens you get cascading defaults, as each default destroys more money and the problem snowballs. 
The only way today's debt can be serviced is by creating more debt tomorrow. If that doesn't happen, everything falls apart.

It's not "bad policy" so much as their hands being forced. Debt-based currencies fail catastrophically when the overall debt load (private+public) stops growing (that is, inflation drops below zero).
They're trying everything they can think of to keep that from happening for as long as possible, because when it does, it's game over. 
Edit: do not take this as a defense of the Fed. It *does* go back to bad policy, but bad policy from 1913 that set up this inevitable end game in the first place.

That's exactly my point. More transactions require more liquidity, which means a higher value naturally. The parent poster's claim of rising prices causing more speculative buyers to raise the price further is not a sustainable situation, and can turn on a dime at any moment.

You buy $2000 worth of BTC at $10, and sell at $15 for $3000. That's a 50% gain. 
Alternatively, you buy $2000 worth at $100, and sell at $150 - again for a 50% gain, or $3000. 
One was a $5 move, the other a $50 move - but percentage-wise they represented the same change in value, and therefore have the same vertical change on a log scale chart. Markets moves are rooted in the psychology of the participants, who view gains and losses this way. 
If BTC were $10k/coin, a $50 move would barely register.

That's not how it would work. People outside the affected area would continue to operate as normal. Miners inside would be so far outmatched by the global hashrate that confirmations inside would slow to a crawl. 
No mayhem is possible outside, because any blocks outside would remain valid after the sync. So all the censorship would accomplish is slowing confirmations for the censored area and opening its own citizens to the possibility of a double spend, and it would be clear who is to blame.


Bitcoin is far from perfect. But it is extremely resistant to censorship, which you don't seem to understand. It's an all-or-nothing proposition, unlike normal censorship where keeping 99% of the population under control is good enough.

You said exchanges can't handle that size, and I asked about how the ETF would get the Bitcoins backing your investment then.

Who's to say what is "ok" when it comes to markets? They represent the best approximation of accumulated human knowledge. Whatever they do, it's more "correct" than what your or I "think" they should do. 


The market gods laugh at your silly models. 


Because it is the first true revolution in money since fractional reserve, and it completely changes the power dynamic that runs the world. The reason BTC is only worth $3 billion today is because the world is in disagreement about whether it will succeed. If it does, it will **unquestionably** be worth orders of magnitude more than it is today - just to provide the liquidity for that many people to use it, if nothing else.
I'm not saying you **should** believe in it, but I do - even at a 99% chance of failure the potential payoff is worth those odds.

I agree with you (and about the price going way higher, and am invested accordingly. I'm just picking nits with your theoretical pricing model. 
If nobody's selling, $1000 of new money can push the price up by $2000. If most people are selling, even $1b of new money could fail to prevent the price from falling. Price movements are solely a function of supply vs. demand *right now*.

Yeah, you're right - there are more variables involved here. Silver spot price is higher than usual at the moment for various reasons (incidentally, trouble in debt currency land is a big one). 
Let me rephrase and say that the quarter still represents approximately the value that the same amount of silver did in 1964. This value fluctuates over time, but inflationary currency is (exponentially!) trending to zero in the long run. So naturally the "price" of physical assets go up in seemingly silly ways - your unit of measurement is shrinking.

I'm getting tired of explaining this, so listen up: Bitcoin is inflationary, and will continue to be until after we're all dead (new bitcoins will continue to be created until 2140).
Inflation isn't about prices, it's about the size of the money supply. The value is rising because demand is outstripping supply+inflation. 
And while we're on the subject, deflation is only dangerous in a debt-based monetary system, which Bitcoin is not. Deflationary spirals happen because defaults on debt cause more defaults on debt. 
Deflation under sound money is a net win: prices fall, making everything cheaper for everybody. Example: the 19th century in the US, during the course of which the general price level dropped by 50% and the standard of living went through the roof.

Inflation is a monetary phenomenon. It refers to the size of the money supply, and has nothing to do with prices. Bitcoin is and will continue to be inflationary until well after we're all dead.

Only when you're talking about a debt-based currency where deflation = cascading defaults. Deflation under sound money is a win for the average Joe and the economy as a whole. 
Of course, this ignores the fact that Bitcoin is highly *inflationary* at the moment. Rising prices and deflation are not the same thing.

Yes. Markets move in percentages, not absolute values.
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:31:41

Economic growth isn't a zero-sum game and isn't defined as relative to anything. Using as little math as possible:
GDP = M * V
... where M is money supply and V is the velocity of money. So assuming 21m BTC exist, no other money does, and each bitcoin is used in an average of 100 transactions a year, the world GDP would be 2.1 billion. If each bitcoin changes hands 200 times, GDP is 4.2 billion. 
GDP is a measure of economic activity, so GDP growth = economic growth. The more economic transactions that happen - meaning each BTC changes hands more often (V is larger) - the "bigger" the economy. 
Economic growth benefits the average citizen when it's based on growth in V, because in a free market both parties benefit from each transaction. The more transactions, the more profits (monetary, material, or otherwise) for everybody. 
Economic growth based on growth in the money supply (like today, when GDP growth and the inflation rate are similar) benefits nobody except those with first access to the new money (i.e. banks). V stays static, so your profits do too.

People use these terms in a fast and loose way, but the original (and only sensible) definitions referred to the money supply inflating or deflating.
Look at the words themselves - if inflation means the purchasing power is going down, what exactly is *inflating*? What is *deflating* when the dollar gets stronger? There's no answer that makes sense, besides the size of the money supply (including debt - QE and friends are an attempt to counteract rampant debt deflation).
Money follows supply and demand like anything else. Supply goes up, price (purchasing power) goes down. It's not rocket science.

No, it obviously isn't exactly analogous to a stock. That wasn't my point - my point was the entity underlying each investment (a corporation or the bitcoin economy) were economically analogous, and that because of this an investment in Bitcoin is more like a growth stock than a preexisting currency.
Your point on voting rights is a good one. But as for sharing in the profits, unless you're getting dividends you're not seeing corporate profits, except as reflected in share price appreciation. This is exactly analogous to BTC appreciation as the underlying economy grows. In the case of a corporate liquidation, your stock is most likely going to be worth exactly zero.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:46:33
Yeah, but there's no evidence to support it. It's just a wild speculation.

I'd suggest using BitPay or Coinbase - they handle all the merchant services for you, including conversion back to fiat and deposit to your bank. You can list your prices in USD (or whatever) and they will keep the BTC price updated for the customer automatically.

No, it's simply using an appropriate scale for the data at hand. If your x-axis and y-axis move at different orders of magnitude, you use log scale to correct for this (and keep this in mind when looking at the chart).
Yes, you can always use log scale. People don't bother because with small movements they're basically identical.


Forex traders use log scale all the time. It's not stock-specific, it's used in all types of data involving exponents. Decibels are measured in log scale. So is the Richter scale. And so on.

I'm not focusing on China, I'm just using it as an example of a heavily censored country. Even in North Korea some people have cellular connections out of the country.
My point is that *entirely* stopping network communications out of a country is impossible, and without 100% perfect censorship, Bitcoin would hardly notice.
You could hide blockchain updates in innocuous-looking files and sneak them in that way. You can hide traffic in DNS requests. Properly used, steganography ensures that it is impossible to even tell that a secondary message *exists*, much less block it.
Failing that, there's shortwave radio; line-of-sight long range wifi to Kazakhstan; a DVD in the trunk of a car; a carrier pigeon; any of these would be enough. They may be able to block the Bitcoin protocol itself, but that's not enough.
Given that we can't even keep drugs out of prisons, you really think China (or any country) can keep data out? Again, only *one person* needs to do this to keep the blockchains in sync.

It's not that hedge funds make you successful, it's that successful traders start hedge funds because people trust them with their money based on past successes.
Trading is like poker - it's not particularly complicated, but it pits you against your own psychology. It's easy to "play well" for a little while, but most people tend to get overconfident and stupid and lose it all. If you're a very self-disciplined person, you can make either one work out for you in the long run. 
I'm actually not sure what I would have done differently, due to my negative outlook. You can't "buy and hold" on the short side - you need to pick your moves carefully and get out while you're ahead. Best move (as an amateur) would probably just have been to stay in cash for awhile.
Today there's an investment that sidesteps everything I'm worried about in the long run: Bitcoin. And it's great for passive buy-and-hold.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:48:47

Yeah, but I felt the same way at $70. I'm prepared for paper losses in the short term, but I'm not going to play those games when I believe Bitcoin will be MUCH higher in a few years. I'm just going to accumulate them at whatever price I can in the meantime.

They're more expensive now because of **in**flation in the meantime. Asset appreciation and deflation are two totally different things.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:25


Right. The underlying value of the asset being purchased is not changing; what *is* changing is some attribute of the currency being used, and as a result the price goes up.
Prices are a reflection of economic realities, they are not the reality themselves. So again I ask, what attribute of the underlying currency, as opposed to the derivative that is price, is "inflating" or "deflating"?


Again, you're right here, but your conclusion doesn't follow. The changing variables are currency-side, not price-side.
I almost addressed this in my original comment, but I decided not to get too long-winded.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:36:23
A shrinking of the money supply. Not asset appreciation. Bitcoin has NOT deflated by 90% this year; it has *inflated* by over a million coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:43:47


You're missing my point. Whatever you can buy directly with Bitcoin, you can also buy the equivalent value in dollars for the same Bitcoins. If not, the possibility of three-way arbitrage exists, and the market forces the prices to converge. If $20k worth of USD buys a candy bar, then 1 car worth of BTC will buy a hell of a lot more than $20k USD.
While I share your opinion of the fiat system, the BTC/USD exchange rate is useful information, and directly speaks to the purchasing power of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:38:28


But there's no ETF yet either.


Why do you say this?
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:42:43

What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:14:50

@_date: 2013-11-24 23:49:22
Bitcoin has fundamentals too - the amount of BTC available for trade needs to be valued at a level that can support the amount of money flowing through it. You can't move $10 billion dollars without buying $10 billion worth of BTC on the open market. Bitcoin simply can't support a significant percentage of global commerce without a MUCH higher valuation.

Are you suggesting that China's firewall is impervious and nobody manages to get around it? Because again, all it takes is **one person** to make it through. One guy with a satellite phone, or a stealth Tor entry point, is enough.
China's firewall stops *most* people. For many things, this is enough. For Bitcoin, it's not. As long as everybody inside can reach each other, and just *one person* has a link to the outside (in a pinch, a carrier pigeon could be made to work), the blockchain will be kept in sync.

Only by handing your coins over to somebody else who handles this security for you, and who checks with you before allowing them to be sent. 
But now you've introduced third-party risk, and once somebody else has the private key the BTC are as good as theirs. Your safest option is an encrypted paper wallet under physical security (safe, bank deposit box, etc.), and a permanently offline computer to sign transactions for spending.
