Awesome! I'll chew all of that over. I really appreciate you taking the time to give such detailed and thought out responses. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 14:41:25
Same thing in silver and gold. People are getting spooked and panic selling.
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:03:00
Fun stuff! I'll be buying all the way up! 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:13:23
I was highly considering one. Is it pretty user friendly?
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:45:10
I'm one of those newbs. Bought my first full coin Sunday in the dip. I'm a precious metals guy, so I understand markets already and not letting this uptrend get me all starry eyed. I really enjoy the ideas behind BTC and plan to continue buying.

Sure thing! Firstly, you'll see a small number to the left of a persons username. That number indicates the amount of successful deals they have had. The flair is issued by a bot. This system is only a month old on the sub.
We also use to give details about deals. When someone posts a listing, a bot will comment with a link to their feedback. This is the best way to get a view of someones trustworthiness.

Since you mentioned an interest in precious metals...in case you didn't know, there are many sellers that take BTC on @_date: 2014-11-24 15:45:23
I really like bits, which are a millionth of a Bitcoin. It helps on few levels:
1) Use means not having to do a ton of math. Instead of a transaction with a number that starts with a decimal and a bunch of zeroes, you can use a nice easy number in the format spenders are used to. Example: a cup of coffee can be 0.009177920545430707 BTC or 9180.33 Bits. See how there are only two numbers after the decimal, which is how a lot of places express fractions of a monetary unit.
2) Bits end the "partial" problem. A new user might not feel to great about owning .25 BTC because it doesn't sound like much. 250,000 bits sounds a lot better. People tend to enjoy owning higher numbers and complete units. Bits helps with that.
3) If BTC really goes to the moon, a whole BTC will be worth way more than most common purchases. Bits will make more sense as spendable units.

Thanks again for the detailed reply. I'm getting to the point where I'd like both a hot and cold wallet as my holdings are getting close to a grand.  There are so many options out there and I'm trying to figure out the best. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:38:40
Ummm...from the sidebar:
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:23:46
Will do! Thank you!

I use breadwallet. If I lose my phone, I can just enter the seedphrase into a new device with breadwallet and I'm good to go.

Great quote! People seem to have difficulty in realizing that being able to survive dips is a strategy that is crucial in money management. There is an art to getting out of a sinking ship, but one must have the wherewithal to survive simple rough seas.

I just learned about riseup's email. Any way you could provide me an invite? I would like a more secure email to use for my Bitcoin transactions. 
 If you can, awesome. If not, that's cool too. Thanks 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:18:16
Thanks! I plan to continue buying as well.
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:53:56
It looks great. I'm browsing it now :)
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:51:47
Thank you! I'm going to have a lot of reading to do on my day off.  
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:18:59
You do a fantastic job in the MM threads. You've answered a few of my dumb questions and I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2014-10-14 00:44:48
Thanks for the reply!
If I may ask a few follow-ups (sorry, I'm new to this)
1) I think what you are saying is that if I use breadwallet for cold storage, there is no way for me to look at the balance once I wipe the wallet. Is that correct?
2) I hear a lot of "you must own the private keys" talk. When I use breadwallet for cold storage, who owns the keys?
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:18:50
I saw a recent post from the creator of breadwallet about using the app to make a cold storage wallet. He stated to start a new wallet, send the pubic key to yourself via email/message, send funds then wipe the wallet from the app. The passphrase can be used to recover all funds later on.
Can I still send coins to the wallet I wiped after this process using the public key from breadwallet? How good of an option for cold storage is this? Any significant drawbacks?
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:53:39
Nice! I can listen to them on the train to work! Thank you.

I won $100 on a $5 scratch off ticket once.

Howdy all!
I'm a moderator at a sub where redditors buy, sell, and trade precious metals. I am also a bitcoin fanboy :)
BTC is starting to catch on as a payment option in the sub, and I'd love to see that trend continue to grow. I'd like to invite you fine folks to check out the sub because it's a pretty neat place to spend or make some BTC. We do a pretty good job moderating there and have built a nice community of trustworthy members, so it's also a safe place to spend BTC...I think in the history of the sub, only 1 person has ever been ripped off. 
Personally, I get a kick out of pairing the oldest way of storing wealth with the newest. Diversification keeps investing fresh and fun for me, and my hope is you guys might get a kick out of it too. Shiny metals are just plain awesome to look at and the possible future of BTC is just as mesmerizing. 
While is only for buying, selling, and trading...general discussion of precious metals is done at That's a good sub to learn and chat about metals. 
I hope to see some of you stop by and pick up some shiny stuff! There are a few online precious metals vendors that take BTC, but I almost always find better deals and cheaper shipping on the sub. Lots of rare stuff end up there as well that can't be found elsewhere.
Feel free to ask any questions you might have. Thanks for reading :)

Man...banks will do anything for an extra buck or two. It's really sad that there are companies/people that have a predatory agenda to profit off the simple fact that people need to use money. Bitcoin is the way we push those vampires out of our lives. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:22:21
Banks are very set in their ways and love charging fees. BTC takes power out of their hands and allows us to send money all over the world without using their services. When something threatens corporate America, companies look for a way to fight it, not embrace it. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:27:13


This is such an overlooked virtue. Do not get in over you head with any investment/store of wealth/speculation. Using $ you cannot spare for a long amount of time can lead to being forced to sell at a loss. I'm a big time silver and gold bug, and if I was forced to sell now, I'd lose money right now. Since I have a realistic buying plan, I can take advantage of the drop, buy from panic sellers, and watch my holdings grow.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:30:40
Cool. I'll just manually request. Thanks for trying, I don't want you to do anything that would put you account in danger.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:58:59
Thank you. How do I check to make sure the funds are going to my cold storage? Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:20:38
Thank you for the informative response! 
If I may ask a few follow up questions:
Is coinbase subject to the same scrutiny that circle is? Would that be a more private venue for purchasing BTC?
I use a Mac laptop, so is bread wallet a good program to use? I'm only of average tech capabilities, so I would want to research computer safety etc to protect myself from malware prior to using it. Do you have a recommended program for safety/privacy?
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:47:28
Great info. Since I don't own a second computer to keep offline, I have been considering a Trezor. Any thoughts on that? Trezor seems to get a lot of love so I figured it's not a bad idea. 
Can I still make a paper back-up of the private keys stored on Trezor?
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:42:46
So, I'd like to contribute more to this sub and want to be able to build my knowledge base to answer questions for people. Where do you guys go for quailty and unbiased news/analysis of BTC? 
On another front: I've turned 3 people onto BTC in the past week. I helped them buy from circle and then walked them trough transferring the funds to breadwallet. It was all pretty simple and user friendly...it's nice to see the tech getting more approachable. 
Edit: thanks for the gold!
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:40:05
Thank you for the reply.
You seem to get a lot of reviews from people who are in the know, so if it helps, I'll share my thoughts as a newer BTC user who is in the low-medium level of tech savvy. I'm a precious metals guy, so using my money "differently" is second nature. 
I like the interface and ease of use a lot. Last night I did a few transfers between wallets and found breadwallet to be just as smooth as circle and coinbase. I discovered breadwallet through some of your comments on reddit while looking for more secure ways to store my BTC. 
The biggest draws of breadwallet for me are:
1) Avoiding reliance on browser based wallets. I use a mac which I know is decently secure, but don't know how to lock a computer against malware.
2) Full ownership of access.
3) Wiping a wallet seems like the easiest form of cold storage I've ran into. While I can afford a Trezor, why spend the money if wiping a wallet is just as secure? 
4) I feel it would be easiest for my wife to recover my holdings from breadwallet in the case of something happening to me. I couldn't imagine her having to get past the learning curve of the technology very well with the other options. 
Some things I'd like to see are:
1) The ability to view both BTC and bits.
2) The ability to enter funds I want to send in fiat with fees added in the confirmation screen. If I want to send $20 t0 X, it would be nice to just type in $20, see $20.03 as what will come from my account and then send.
Thanks again!

Thanks for the reply. I will read the entire wiki :)

I'm not mad at the idea of nubits! Pretty smart to stabilize it. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:44:42
I bought my first coin yesterday and plan to continue being part of this movement. I will use circle as my hot wallet, but, in regards to cold storage:
Do I need an offline computer to create a paper wallet? I'd like to use cards from cryptocards.co to store my private key in my safe and my mothers safe. 
I was planning on using bitaddress.org to create my private key and passcode. 
Am I correct that I can continue to safely feed my cold storage by sending money to it's public address?
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:18:23
After a wallet is wiped, can I still send coins to it using the old receive address?
