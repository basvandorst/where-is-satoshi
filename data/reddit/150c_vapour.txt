Do you have a git?  Seems like useful viz tools for following usdt flows too.

I don't think you'll have to wait long.

The owner may be an exchange insider.  Kind of odd timing around tether end of month and the new pump cycle.  Might explain some of their confidence.

I'm hoping to convince others not to invest in a manipulated market and failing tech.  Similar motivations as r/antimlm maybe?

Don't think anything decomposes that fast in a few weeks.

Of course, just getting a patent is "offensive", like another commenter said.  Wouldn't it be great though if formal and organized ventures in the economy could be built without banks and lawyers.  We aren't quite there yet.

They may not have a choice, it may be a requirement in their last VC round.  It's a way to show "progress" without revenue.

It hit 700 on bitfinex today.  640 now.  Maybe a little sign?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:13:40
It's more likely an attempt at price manipulation in this case. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:02:54
Look at "networks" tab.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:29:55
Yep exactly.  Dirt simple attack.

Are there any gpl projects for fpga code that can run on commodity dev boards?  Are there any gpl reference designs for spartan 6's?  Is it actually profitable?? 
It's pretty clear that the delivery times and "testing" periods by asic producers must rob nearly all but a tiny bit of the advantage of asic's for mining.

There's a ddos attack happening on BCC with thousands of bad acting nodes spinning up on AWS in the last hour.  May factor into what happens.  Propagation will be very slow.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:28:53
In a peer network if large numbers of peers act badly the network functions badly.  It's not failing.  All P2P currencies have this vulnerability in various forms.  There's various remedies too.
@_date: 2018-06-30 00:15:28
There is high volatility and then there is randomly volatile.  Because of manipulation.

It seems like zcash would be a good target for fpga.  Not sure if an fpga could attain better performance then a gpu though.  
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:17:23
Yea, if you do a little closer looking there you'll see the uptick is all connected to tether searches.   Try it!   It's fun to overcome cognitive dissonance.  Big uptick in "tether bitcoin" searches though.  Get out now, it's not going to go well for bitcoin this summer.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:42:21
No it will carry on with Bitcoin at a price closer to it's "true" value.  Why would it disappear?  Bitcoin will never be with 10k again.  Sorry.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:15:02
Meme is saturated.  There is no bull run like before possible.  Bitcoin has missed it's chance for mass adoption already, didn't take.
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:32:18
Logical arguments like this are why I sold months ago.  Have fun with those bags.

Mmm.. and the last months?   Bitcoin is broken.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:01:21
Probably because you aren't looking for it correctly?  Are any of your peers from ec2?

And aliens might land!  Two probabilities being greater then zero does not make them equal.

A lot of people trying to understand the tether risks.  This could be a warning sign of crash incomming. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:52:20
You guys realize that the posts hitting through r/all today are about selling out right?  That's what's resonating.  That's what people are thinking about when they see these posts here.  There's no one reasonable that thinks they will get a car by hodl'ing.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:26:04
So you told your repair shop that your computer had Bitcoin on it then left them with superuser privilege??  Jesus of course you got ripped off.  What people on this sub don't like to acknowledge is if you have bitcoin these days you need up shut the f**k up about it.  You're painting a target just talking about how you hodl in public.  It's no longer safe to spread the meme.
@_date: 2018-06-23 02:27:50
Sell now.  4k is not the bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:30:33
People don't understand the time scales of these things.  It took Intel stock twenty years post dotcom to return to the same level.  It could take Bitcoin just as long.
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:13:51
Lol no sane person would invest in a ticker that goes either way 5% in seconds.  That's a roulette wheel and that's why it's getting abandoned despite repeated pumps.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:43:52
Congrats man!
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:38:50
No bitcoin likey won't need help from anything else to continue to crash at this point.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:45:18
I totally liquidated months ago.  We are going to be able to buy a house for our family because I didn't fall for the hodl memes.  I held for many years though.  I've probably been following the bitcoin dev mailing list far longer then most here have hodled.  No crystal ball, but take my advice, dump the bags for now, crypto has broke.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:43:51
Why can't crytpo companies use Generally Accepted Auditing Standards?
An auditor adheres to profesional codes and standards for rigourosly examinig  a set of accounts.  They are risking orders of magnitude more in certifying an audit.  FSS is not risking anything here, and also doesn't seem to be claiming a lot either.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:08:41
Lol on this sub tethers are totally real and BTC pumps are for tinfoil hats.

So the criminals that exploit and control the economy for billions through  rigged games of speculation are totally cool? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:10:46
I'm pretty sure I could prove kraken is front running.  Their server time slowly creeps into the future corresponding with fast market moves.  This is not a normal load balancing technique for something as time critical as a trade engine and ledger.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:17:06
I'm maxing out on kraken with about 600 orders a minute / key / ip.  I'm quite sure there are very well funded privileged/co-located multi-site bots.  I suspect there is a big one on bitcoin that's really falling to pump right now and has also dramatically increased it's cycle rate.  On every feasible pump condition I think it fires but they just don't catch.  No extra money on table these days.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:45:56
Ok makes sense, I'm not really familiar with GDAX and was just speculating.  It is how to get around rate limits on some other sites.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:21:28
Constantly moving liquidity close to where it is profitable if a trade is taken can appear to be spoofing.   And in fact it acts as a spoof with a big stack but may not be the intention.  Obviously lots of spoofing is happening though.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:24:46
If USDT crashes then it'll be a long while before the HODLers beat whatever algo's some within finex may be partnering with. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:22:15
Ok but kraken, finex et al *do* meltdown.   I'm not familiar with GDAX but with something like 50 pairs and needing 100 updates a second that capacity might get used to quickly.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:23:27
Because you run code against as many exchanges as possible to maximize arbitrage, reliably classify price movements, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:03:04
Number of issued tethers is approaching 500m.  It's possible they aren't backed up with fiat as robustly as claimed.  Pegged currencies have had structural problems in general.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:22:24
Don't get too excited.  A decent portion of new accounts are likely used to boost API call rates for algo traders.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:57:16
Finex/Tether pump in effect. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:46:08
Bitfinex is running their margin/tether pump hard right now, to play off fork fud.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:21:03
I dunno about coinbase but several other exchanges have tiered access with the lowest not requiring KYC. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:44:53
Forget what overheated finex markets suggest.  Nobody is planning to use S2X IRL.  Nobody is excited outside of having a new tradable coin.  Nobody thinks this could be BTC future.   You going to cash in BTC for S2X maybe?
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:28:18
API calls are rate limited.  A single key can only make so many calls/second.   With multiple keys/ip's a bot can execute more trades, check order book more frequently and generally get an edge over other bots.  With enough keys they can spam the API and edge out manual traders.
Anyone manually day trading crypto these days is at a significant disadvantage vs bots.   
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:25:29
Updates/second of order book doesn't matter as much as acting in the shortest amount of time following a trade that moves price.  How many times a second should the order book be read to ensure you generally act before other HFTs?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:38:25
Not quite, r/btc was not so much supportive of s2x but have been repeatedly calling attention to r/bitcoin's intense distaste for any hard fork.  I think they are still pretty bitter about all the hate they got for supporting bcc.  You may be confusing that as support.  They were supportive of BCC because of the many still valid arguments that it is a progressive fork.   S2x was always a compromise, BCC was not.  Turns out no one really wants to compromise.  I repeat that s2x is an opportunistic fork.  Finex is exploiting it, traders are all too eager to fomo.  For all practical purposes it's a shitcoin that'll decline like every other over hyped ico that fails to deliver gains.  On the plus side when it fails the next contentious hard fork will be a tough sell.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:13:48
FIX API costs money right?  Requires kyc?  The extra calls may only be to retrieve order book and recent trades.  It could be for other purposes as well but still with automation.  They may not be motivated to purge bad accounts when it looks like users are increasing for investors.  Or they may just be faking the user numbers.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:54:59
Ok so people were excited about BCC because they genuinely thought it had more future then BTC wrt tx times and fees.  Like you just said you basically just want another hyped ico to 2x+ right?  And you don't actually think there is the possibility of this legit replacing BTC?  That's a big difference between BCC and s2x.  It's a coin of opportunity not of need and utility.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:16:46
You write terribly but you're exactly right.  They are milking the fork fud.  Everyone here wants to imagine it is only strong fundamentals and shrewd buyers.  Lol it's algorithmic trading and finex pumps.
@_date: 2018-07-14 11:07:05
Lol, everyone Keen to keep heads in sand.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:25:18
Where is the subreddit?  Even shitcoins have their own subreddit.
@_date: 2018-07-13 10:35:47
That's the primary use case right now.   That's most likely why someone who's never bought would buy now.  Do some TA, bet 100x on bitmex, get rich/rekt.  Bitcoin is not a store of value, used less and less for anything but exchange trading.  Dump your bags.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:02:28
What if it's a massive pump running on tether that's only playing off the S2X hype?  Nobody on Reddit seems even a little excited for S2X.  Not like BCC.  Why does every spike start on finex?  Imagine how much bitcoin they would make if they trigger  a dip at some point and liquate fomo margin positions. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:42:10
You spelled "the bitmain network" wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:28:50

@_date: 2017-10-13 18:47:42
Based on what??  
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:56:25
Going to take a lot more then down votes to keep bitcoin from crashing further I think.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:04:38
But the tx times of lots of alts including BCC are quite good.  In general s2x has little in the way of features to drive adoption. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:43:07
Bro how many people use AOL?  I was around during that bubble too.  It doesn't look good for BTC, trust me.

Yea I just feel annoyed.  I'm sure there's some feeling suicidal right now.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:17:28
I made a new account to test their api.  Sent one eth, tired to withdraw, found out there was a waiting period for new accounts because of money laundering concerns, and the site gets shut down hours later.  Ugh.
