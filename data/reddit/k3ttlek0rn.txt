I know you can, but the OP makes it seem like this purchase is going to set her up. He literally just put 28 bucks in the account. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:13:39
.002 BTC...really setting her up. If bitcoin doesn't balloon to like $1 million that isn't gonna be enough for anything.

Well he said not 3k. Not is a very definitive term. If he said probably not, or most likely not, or something like that then okay. But he said not like he's positive in that statement. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:22:13
Or he could have gone back and read my comment once more 
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:25:03
That it's not a sure thing now that the price won't go to 3k. No one knows. He was acting like it absolutely can't happen. But it could. I'm not saying whether I think it will or not. I've just been involved and learning about cryptos for like a year now and the amount of predictions I've seen that have been so wrong is absurd. I remember when bitcoin dropped from 20k to like 13k and people were saying it was just consolidating there and that was the bottom. Then it dropped to like 9k and then I heard the same shit. So now it's at 8k and people are saying that this is it and it surely won't drop further.

Definitely still could do that though 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:04:21
You have reading comprehension issues 
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:21:51
Well then he could have just reread my comment after instead of doubling down
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:09:47
It's not an argument lol. You entirely misunderstood my comment and argued against something I didn't even say. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:09:44
Yes, but we have reached the point where the average person has very little say in the operation of the government. You can always cut their tax revenue in multiple ways, but that doesn't mean the government will use their now limited resources in a better way. If anything, they'll just cut back social safety nets and education or things like that instead of what we are aiming to achieve which is better representation of our wants and needs.

Printing more bills to pay corporations doesn't make sense. If they inflate the currency they'll just need more money to pay the debt. It's not like international debt.

There's a paper trail no matter what. If a company sells a product and they make revenue but there's a huge gap in taxes paid or reported revenue, they're gonna get audited. If the government then realizes they're losing a whole shit ton of tax revenue from bitcoin purchases they're gonna make a change. Somehow, some way. Bitcoin is fine if you're purchasing things from small businesses or just individuals, but if it becomes standard currency for people buying things from businesses like Amazon or Wal-Mart or something, it's not gonna fly. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:53:51
But what if the government just forces corporations to charge a tax on bitcoin purchases? What are you gonna do about that?
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:07:35
I think you misunderstood me. I didn't mean a paper trail in the exchange of bitcoin. I meant a paper trail in terms of sales and movement of product for a corporation. That's impossible to hide. You are free to use bitcoin of course, and I know the government can't outlaw it entirely, but they can ban companies from accepting it as a form of payment. Of course you can always buy things from overseas or from a black market of sorts, but then costs increase and it becomes more difficult. I just don't see the future of bitcoin in terms of freeing one's self from the government the way others do. It seems to me to be an extension of the same sorts of political theories that have given rise to libertarianism and anarchism. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:43:16
I agree. I can see the value in cryptocurrencies. I just don't think it's gonna replace regular fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:59:50
How is that theft? Theft involves someone gaining the losses of another person. Devaluing a currency is not the same as stealing it. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:27:08
Well of course but my point was that he specifically references the government using the people's money to bail out corporations but they didn't steal that money, it was tax revenue. There's an argument to be made for the government's usage of tax revenue but it's hardly just stolen from you. If people start using bitcoin for purchases in large amounts, the government isn't gonna just let a huge drop in tax revenue go. They'll start taxing bitcoin purchases somehow, or they'll make it illegal. It's not gonna just circumvent the whole process. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:46:10
Yeah, the latter is what I think is a bit ridiculous
