A few minimum requirements for a "decent" bitcoin casino:
1) Been around for more than 1 year.
2) No unsolved deposit/withdral issues during the year (check their forum thread in BTCTalk)
3) Provably Fair and the system has been vetted by others.
I'm proud to say our casino: CoinRoyale fits all the criteria. We've also spent a lot of time improving our game experience. Check it out:

Say what again!

I did succeed once on getting a design firm to accept bitcoin. Well I guess past success is not a good indicator of the future.

Self plug:
Bitcoin Casino with the best looking Blackjack and Baccarat. Provably fair (of course), and in HTML5. We just started 3 months ago but already paid out thousands of BTC.

Did it go way down? Seemed pretty stable to me. (right now $420 at bitstamp)
