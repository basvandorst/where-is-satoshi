Nope....it is totally true.  When I read it back it literally seems like it can't be real.....but it is.

The only strategy that works is to HODL. I have tried to do market timing myself.  Trying to buy and sell on GDAX without fees on 5% moves, literally risking thousands to make a hundred bucks.  When it falls, it goes so fast that you can't catch it and sell, and when it runs up you are left chasing it until you end up always buying in too high.  HODLing is the only way to go. (and I feel bad for your situation btw....nobody should lose their money.)

Then STFU.....haha
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:46:26
Hahaha.....my advice is to not buy anything......for my sake not yours!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:16:40
Sounds completely legit.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:55
Very true
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:52
God forbid you try and move some coin to a different exchange during a volatile day.....pending....pending....fuckin pending.

maybe....but ya gotta sleep sometime!

Note taken.  Had not really thought about it like that.  I was more interested in hearing opinions from people who just started with the mania and then saw the correction, and how those particular people were going to react.  But you are right, by eliciting their opinions they gain power.....going to remove the comment.

Every other exchange shows it at around 35oo
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:30
not necessarily....but nobody ever catches the bottom and it is better to be in than out if you believe in it...

They couldn't.  Best they can do is shut down American access to the exchanges by closing them if they are located on American soil, and making credit card or bank transfers of fiat difficult, the way they do with online gambling.  Bitcoin doesn't belong to America, so there is no way for the FEDS to do anything about it.....
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:29:08
Doubt it....Asian markets move almost exactly opposite American ones when there is volatility....but who the fuck knows any more.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:32
you bought almost 11K worth of Bitcoins and "forgot" about them? You must have been pretty rich already....why not give it to charity?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:06

Nah.....typical monday and tuesday lately.  Will be back over 18 by late tomorrow.  I wouldn't dump till under 14....
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:49:29
Nobody has a crystal ball.....I would just HODL and let the shit flush itself out before doing anything.

I am not sure I believe the info there....but it could be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:05
Impressive read on the correction.  You are better at this than I am!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:00:39
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:25:44
Neither of those are supported during this new scamfork anyway
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:25
Haha....i will buy them from you at 15!
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:22:34
I am not defending the idea, just seeing what others think.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:49:54
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:48:14
No it can be on any of the supported exchanges or wallets (but with a cold wallet you will need to know what you are doing to claim your coins.) The website of the new shitcoin only states support by 5 exchanges and two wallets, neither one of which is any good.  Don't make moves during a fork chasing split coins, too much uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:48:30
It means nothing.  It will change nothing.  You will be allocated free coins if you had Bitcoin on a wallet or exchange that supported the fork.  Almost nobody legitimate did
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:01:05
Hell of a prediction......hats off.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:32
could happen.....and so could 19
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:29:14
Should be within the hour....but it's a total scam.  Different dev team...total pump....futures down 65 percent before the fork as word spreads.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:23:31
This is very smart.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:46:46
Haha....very true

@_date: 2018-02-21 02:39:14
Theres a lot of places.  Google "the top 100 biggest Bitcoin wallets" and you will get a bunch of sites that track these things.  If you click on the top 10 or so you will see their ins and outs, and when they transfer coin.  If they transfer to a wallet that has hundreds of thousands of transactions that is probably an exchange.....when they move coin to an exchange then something is going to happen.

The second largest Bitcoin wallet transferred about 15K Bitcoins to exchanges over the last few days.  One other whale wallet transferred about 50K Bitcoins about a week ago.  No other wallets are showing large transfers.  Possibility that someone is just turning coins into cash for a big purchase, or just driving the market down to buy everyone's coins cheap.
