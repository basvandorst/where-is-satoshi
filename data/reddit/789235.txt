Bitcoin.org doesn't get any inquiries like that as far as I can see.

You can't really make a statement for a company having good financials and then go back on it saying the bit you saw was good, just not the rest of it. If you vouch for someone, you vouched, there's no conditionals in that. You're imprinting the trust someone has for you in the company. If you don't have the ability to evaluate who you are vouching for **keep your mouth shut about it**.

Begs the question why you need "voting" on a list of wallets to begin with. Bitcoin.org (where the data is copied from) seems to handle it just fine.

That's why you got your admin panel privileges removed? Come on.

Check out the [bump wallet]( stuff on bitcoin.com.


You'd think the money sent there would go to the wallet developer the address is under, right? Nah, it goes to Roger Ver, this is how he plans on making back his $100,000, through people confused that the donation addresses might be going to actual wallet development.

Yeah, the ones that pay for legitimacy are usually scams, it's not like someone like Breadwallet or Armory have to pay to get people to notice them.

Yeah. Ver confirmed that somewhere and justified it with "well I need to make a profit somehow".

You're a criminal that doxxed a Bitcointalk user and threatened them over $50, why should we trust **you**?
