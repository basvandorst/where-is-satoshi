World banking uses 100 terrawatt, it is used to drive the world economy, and makes
 7.4 billion people work on daily basis, bitcoin uses 30 terrawatt and it is used by a few people, and you cant even buy a cup of coffee with it, and takes hours for a transaction and you pay 40 dollars for it.

  The validation of the chain can be made more simple with more diversification and collective power, maybe one phone validates a
portion of the block and belongs to a group, that is managed by
a central pc that validates the block.

 It´s being attacked, by central powers, by setting a cloud
of uncertainty over it.

 We can think for ourselves, why we want this corrupt middle man,
that is greedy, and every April says give me 30% of your money, or buy this banana but pay me 23% for me or whatever on top illegal
tax they invent for anything they could possible think off.
 The system has it is now is not sustainable anymore, to the point
a few rich people dont even pay tax, they have the power to corrupt this "middle man", even get elected for president with the
help of his few rich friends that control propaganda media channels
and election "supervisors". We dont need this, if I need to drive on a road I can pay the use myself, if I need medical services I can pay myself, the taxes we pay, only a small % goes to pay this services, the rest goes to this machine of "middle man" so they can bailout the goldman sachs`s of this world, and to make sure they themselves dont pay a dime in taxes.  world is ours.

The problem is supply from whales that flood the market at
annual high points and it rockets down.

 Also those 3.7 billion of people that don't have a bank account are more dependent on the banking system than pyramid schemes. Also the transaction of currency digitally is 99.9% already in the banking system, that's what you need to wire money to coinbase.

 No the banking system is huge and over century's years old,
overnight is whales cashing out to
be more precise at 10:38 pm.

 @ 10:38 is late for some people!

 Do you control exchange business? no. Some people do, but not you.

 The concept has value, great tool to store information safe, accurate and fast, accessible to anyone, but despite the problems of
central banks are going this days, they work more or less effective.
 I agree that the system is biassed designed to a central point of
interest, and the need of a world decentralized network of valued trade is close, but this must be more than this platform is going now, otherwise we go back to the good old days of rigid central
power of the powerful.

 Its all fun games, but burning this much power for a few whales play the speculation game is against the reasonable stance.
 They manipulate the market with no respect to the small fish
or they life savings. only the professionals are cashing out
at the perfect timing with inside trading information,
this is not power to the people, this is mafia style organization
much as the churches in the USA.
 This    is getting ridiculous.
Produce something useful with value to society.
