It's like getting [**'corzined'.**](

How many times have *you* been sued?
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:20:45


Nope, just the facts, ma'am.

Well, we all know how the U.S. justice system excuses wealthy white collar criminals, but there *is some good news*. [**Corzine fails to win dismissal of MF Global customers' lawsuit**](

Wow, you must have some shifty, expensive lawyers!  I guess that explains why you were forced to "retire" at 50.
I've *never* been sued, but then I'm an honest guy who treats people as I'd like to be treated.

How many workers did you lay off? Why did you become 'poison' in the corporate world?
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:29:34


Oh. I'm sorry. Let me get this straight. You claim you *retired 15 years ago as the CEO of a huge company* which was mismanaged into acrimonious bankruptcy, throwing 100,000 people out of work and igniting SEC investigations and lawsuits on behalf of plundered shareholders... *just because you wanted to spend the last decades of your life yapping on reddit*. That makes sense.

I see you're eager to defend another crony political insider crook again. You elitists never change, do you? What is this thing you have for crooked bankers, Nolibs?
