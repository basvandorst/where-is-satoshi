I'm complaining that I can't make a transaction on Coinbase, not that Coinbase is unfairly targeting BTC.

I did the same from GDAX to Binance last night, and it took around an hour to complete. You sure you're looking in the right place in Binance?

Did you buy on Coinbase? I'm still not able to make BCH transactions.

Shoutout to Coinbase for blocking BTC transactions during the dip (??)

When I transfer to Binance from GDAX, it never says anything about a fee, and I don't think I got charged. But when I go to Binance to see my deposit and click "check," it takes me to BTC.com and shows a fee of .00226 BTC. 
Who pays this fee? Did I somehow get charged without knowing? The full amount I transferred is in my Binance account...

I see a lot of people talking about the big fees associated with Coinbase transferring; can't you still transfer to GDAX and transfer out to another wallet for free? Or does that no longer work? Trying to figure out how to change a little BTC to XRP, without having to pay big fees or wait days for BitStamp to verify me.

Yes, both of those statements are true. I specified BTC because 1) that's what I was trading in at that moment, and 2) we're in the Bitcoin subreddit.

If you're talking about my post below, it's purely me trying to diversify my portfolio a bit, especially when XRP is relatively cheap. Still hodling for the most part.
