Also, how could he say that before the client has already payed and payed only $5?

Any exponencial curve can look linear if you look at small  intervals... In fact the smaller the interval you look, the more like a line it will seem. The author either doesn't know this or chooses to ignore it to paint his opinion with nalinterpreted data. You could fit a exponential curve in all of these charts.

You can't compress it much because it has very high entropy.

That's simply not true. Lenders wouldn't lend btc accounting for it's usd value, they would be paid back in bitcoin, so any price swings would be irrelevant, as they would affect your money if you held it instead of lending it. At the end of the day, you will ALWAYS make more money lending than holding, it doesn't matter if the currency is inflationary or deflationary (if you are paid back, that is).

Oh yes. Principles certainly come before 1/6 of the network wealth. Happily, the market disagrees with your absolutist view and the forked chain has grown hugely ever since.

Fast Sync nodes sync to the current state and validate all future transactions. There is no advantage to keeping the whole history.

The Mt gox hack happened over the course of several months, so it was effectively impossible to roll back, while the dao hack was fixed WITHOUT rolling back any transactions, contrary to what you say. Besides that, it was much smaller in scale than the DAO hack (relative to the network).

Ethereum has 3 times the number of nodes Bitcoin has.

At least one third of the market cap agrees with my perspective. Principles are good, but they aren't to be taken absolutely. The eth hardfork was very bad, but losing 3 million ether would be much worse.

Great. More free time.

The community voted for the fork, with their mining power, with their coins, and with their money. It wasn't  a a dictator's decision nor was it "draconian". The slippery slope argument also didn't hold, as there have been new hacks that weren't reversed. The network was still in it's infancy; for me, the hard fork was a prime example of the success of social consensus. Also, you don't speak for most bitcoiners, please stop talking as if so.

But say my program detects the client paid no fee. How am I as a store supposed to react if I can't reject a bitcoin transaction?
I'm asking because while someone trying to fraud a 5$ transaction might seem unlikely, I'm 100% sure that a LOT of people I'm my country would attempt this, so I can't just count on the honesty of people.

If the client is reasonable this might be OK, but the client might claim that yes he paid and is not going to trust the store to give him the money back if he happens to be double charged.
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:36:21
Nice. thanks for your answer.
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:59:15
The article says that the store's node will receive the transaction a few seconds later but doesn't Bitcoin transactions take hours  to confirm?

With control of his email account, the hacker could reset his coinbase password, which, imho, is ridicously flawed.

Except both of these are government/bank imposed? Inflation doesn't simply increase if you decrease demurrage, it only happens by issuing new money. If the amount of money was fixed you could save money under your bed and its purchase power would increase due to economic growth...

Who said there's gonna be a dip?

You mean total transaction volume? The number of bitcoins doesn't seem like an important metric for it's usage..
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:34:34
If that was done, buying would go down a lot, because people would know it's overpriced. Also, people who were not selling at current prices would start to because then they would sell at a profit. After getting tired of hugely increased competition and hugely diminished sales, bitcoin sellers would start lowering their prices again.
