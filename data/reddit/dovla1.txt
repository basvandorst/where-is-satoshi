I definitely miss Gavin era bitcoin. Good old days without inflated egos and bickering
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:07:08
my settings:
dbcache=100(or less)
maxmempool=100 (or disable completely with blocksonly)
Also Classic is far more stable for me compared to Core
You can install daemontools to restart the server after the crash automatically

HI - has anyone had to update their node on raspberry? What is the procedure?
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:09:26
you could download the blockchain on the computer and transfer the files to RpI, that will speed up the  initial synch
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:35:10
i don't think it matters that much if one of the chains is considered an altcoin. The more important information is that the exchanges will support both chains. So the stalemate continues
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:25:39
you may want to keep both for a little bit, just in case
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:47:50
Finally some cool news and a break from general toxicology. Congrats to RSk, this was in the making for quite some time

I just bought my 21st guitar!!! I am in the club!
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:15:43
great post!
also a lot of abusive language here lately
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:12:18
PoW change would create a fork with low security as it could be attacked by botnets or someone with enough hardware or money willing to spend to kill it off. Also it would drive all the SHA256 miners to BU. It's a very dangerous option IMO 
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:48:50
Has core commented on this yet?
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:23:27
spam doesn't exist
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:49:29
not another twitter poll ffs

the hamster doesn't concern itself with opinions of other hamsters
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:28:55
alternatively you can relax and let the market decide, competition drives evolution
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:53:27
why the hate, competition is good
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:50:23
it's an open source software, anyone can run whatever they like
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:17:08
it does clear the mempool to be honest

merge-mine with doge
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:57:00
well the days of all SHA256 on a single chain are gone, and i think will not return
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:22:43
this is allowed by the btc protocol, miners are playing by the rules
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:16:54
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:14:40
if core sued the exchanges that would be something
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:52:05
nothing's threatening to kill bitcoin, relax
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:16:11
don't forget the bitcoin cash hate posts
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:25:38
this is not precise hashrate, just an estimate according to the number of blocks found. it is definitely not 0
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:47:07
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:06:12
core was spamming all along and stopped because of segwit ?
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:50:25
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:02:25
it's the best thing for BTC actually, we need multiple chains to compete and evolve. the market forces will provide the survival pressure
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:57:32
forget rational arguments, focus on hats and memes against bitcoin cash!

legal?? lolz
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:39:58
just let it go
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:09:41
if you are correct, the market will punish the investors and bch will die off eventually. i think that the both chains will be around for a while and the oscillations will calm but who knows
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:09:01
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:53:35
core rhetoric is ramping up, signs of desperation?
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:28:38
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:04:33
blocks per hour shouldn't affect the calc. it's price/diff, right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:59:34
so why not kick the can down the road at all?
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:15:38
apples and oranges though
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:57:07
lets shrink the blocks then?
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:00:24
there always have and will be occasional empty blocks mined
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:51:37
"smart miners"?
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:55:50
there's no fight, just run the software you like
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:56:06
is it broken or the code is working as intended
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:18:53
there is no harm is having multiple forks, the inferior ones will die off
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:27:05
they also want bigger blocks
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:14:59
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:40:25

@_date: 2017-11-05 18:33:31
POW is not really important. Twitter, reddit and RPis provide consensus.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:16:49
i don't disagree, but that is for the market to decide and the investors can gamble with their money
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:16:56
until a year ago,for the last 7 years, it was ~90%
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:50:20
no need for agreements in crypto, anyone can and should fork
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:43:28
the other coins are catching up in value actually and btc is losing dominance
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:37:21
Satoshi's what?
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:08:56
ha, he is probably ok, i would imagine
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:51:21
bitcoin cash, litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:49:54
What gives a fork value?
just like the legacy chain, pure speculation
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:51:26
Yes, 1.8TN dollars in daily volume is newbies buying the wrong coin
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:34:42
there's nothing wrong with altcoins, btc can only evolve faster if forced to compete
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:48:14
maybe they have better things to do than troll on reddit and twitter and/or play with swords at home
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:40:46

Does this apply to empty blocks only?

How do you get a custom message to appear next to a node client version?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:21:51
Blockstream vs Bitmain is way more decentralized
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:50:53
@_date: 2017-04-01 03:14:16
A step in the right direction IMO. Thanks for the effort

@_date: 2017-04-10 21:18:24
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:15:14
Oh I see, makes sense
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:53:35
and it crashed
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:57:46
Of course they can, it is an open source, that's how it is supposed to be. Anyone can change anything, you as a user can run whatever software version you like.
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:27:14
get a hat
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:19:08
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:49:34
just run the software that you like and relax
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:20:37
Why would 2x be less immutable?
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:52:46
why do you care what happens on the other chain?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:39:30
sounds reasonable

BTC gold did it already
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:26:27
What's the KTM/BTC rate?
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:02:21
KTM is pumping right now
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:17:39
or a non core client for that matter
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:28:49
how can they have the same rules?

nice pic
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:45:49
They can't force anything on anybody, you're free to run whichever software you like
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:36:19
fees on top of fees?
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:02:39
Also consider that bitcoin cash is traded freely and its price is not fixed, just like legacy bitcoin. By selling BCH you could lose out on some profits depending on how the price of BCH and BTC develops in the future. You could also sell only BTC, or both
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:20:08
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:58:11
it may sound crazy, but maybe they have better understanding than random guys on reddit 
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:23:13
why take 3 if you can take 6
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:13:32
are they against 2X?
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:39:29
might have to do with this sub in particular, just sayin...
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:35:50

@_date: 2017-05-28 23:49:12
