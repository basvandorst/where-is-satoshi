Marriage is about making your partner happy and in turn hoping they reciprocate. You shouldn't be asking us but rather your potential fiance or her friends/family what you should do. If a ring makes her happy it doesn't make a difference if 2 BTC turns into a windfall down the road. 
Either way good luck. 
Let us know how it turns out.

I bought in Q4 2017 and Q1&amp;2 2018 and went in fairly heavy considering my finances. I am still holding despite getting really tempted to sell in Jan 2019. Just enjoy the ride. Of course only put in want you can lose.

It's sad when you have to make yourself feel better by trashing others.

I bought that book a long time ago and want my money back.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:31:21
It is overly simplified and the the information therein is not of much use. It is to financial planning what "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" is to a succesful marriage. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:59:19
Very true. I respect your right to an opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:57:47
Right. But this guy took the above points and turned it into a multilevel package with several books and seminars. The whole thing is about his financial freedom.

Have fun! (I miss university)
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:41:57
I'm very confused.  How does that article involve Soros, Trump, or immigrants? I feel like I'm missing subtext.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:05:31
For Coinsquare it is 10K.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:33:46
Nice car. I always thought theyhad a very sleek design.
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:19:44
In December BTC was all over the news but the majority of people still don't know what it is or how it works. It all depends on how far market adoption goes. I'm not calling it to go one way or the other but nobody can make a black and white statement like that. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 17:23:18
You can't wire such a small amount. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:37:35
Have fun! Got back from Japan two weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:48:54
Cars.  Plane tickets.  Computers.  Light bulbs. Cost of knee joint replacement. Clothes. The list of products that are cheaper in terms of fiat now as compared to 30 years ago is long. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:08:29
That's what I mean. You could have bought morr of it at this price.
@_date: 2019-11-25 03:57:52
That was hilarious. I'm curious do you think this is death throes or a continuing bear market?
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:54:10
What does a woman with injected lips and a leather one piece zip up have to do with Google searches? So odd.
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:06:41
It is absolutely crazy. But even more interesting are the parallels I see in other parts of life whether it is science, governance, or politics. It's an eye opener.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:36:48
Good retort. Good luck on the ring and the life partner.
@_date: 2019-11-24 06:00:17
I need to do this. I've been white knuckle clenching for 2 years now. It's exhausting.

There is a podcast about OneCoin?

You're young and you can bounce back quickly. Good luck!

Dude... this podcast is f***ing amazing. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-24 05:56:27
I don't agree with everything the OP wrote but it definitely got a good conversation rolling. Thanks. ����
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:31:12
Sweet. Thanks!

Smart answer

3 times but I feel your buyer's remorse.

Love Mexico City. Enjoy!
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:27:56
You are a lucky person.
@_date: 2019-08-18 01:37:48
Mexico City is awesome. I'm heading there in 5 months. I'll definitely check it out.
@_date: 2019-10-20 16:23:16
Your comment was pretty even handed and the article attached was interesting. Thanks.

I have never seen a Japanese person flash a gaudy amount of jewellery. I didn't know there was a market for that in Japan.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:50:44
Sounds like some yucky cheerios
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:32:32
I agree 100%
@_date: 2019-10-18 18:27:48
Fair enough. Some of my friends collect them for that purpose.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:35:01
I bought in heavy from Feb 2018 until Nov 2018... It was a painful ride and in January my wife was occasionally suggesting I sell before it went to zero. I'm glad I didn't but it was agonizing at times. Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:10:29
Nicely done! Enjoy!
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:10:12
Awesome video. Thanks for the Christmas gift.
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:20:55
It represents diversification of assets in my investment portfolio. In addition I'm excited about the technology in this nascent sector.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:19:52
Did you manage to sell it for BTC? I think this is a great development. Unfortunately I don't have that amount of BTC and I'm currently not in the market for a rental property. 
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:40:24
Forbes' level of quality is highly variable. I've read absolute garbage in there.

T.dot. love it
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:18:22
I hope it wasn't at a loss

Welcome aboard. I hope you enjoy the emotional roller coaster. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:48:07
A lot of hate on this thread. I believe the story. I have a group of friends that have invested 50-200K each. All financially secure and believe in the technology behind crypto. They have all invested what they are willing to lose. One, an investment portfolio manager put it like this: "it could go to zero but if it took hold it is so revolutionary that I would feel much worse if I wasn't  a participant."
Invest what you can afford to lose and only in what you believe in. If it goes to zero or to the moon it is going to be one raucous ride.

Thumbs up for a fellow Canadian. Nice job on the interview too.
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:34:14
The sticker looks cool though. Can't contest that.
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:20:45
I have an economics degree but it still means little in terms of predicting the outcome of cryptocurrency.

I'm a fan. It is hard to tear and I like the multicoloured aspect.

Nice mug. I also see a health clinic of some sort.

Why don't you sell on an exchange? Coinsquare and QuadrigaCX being the two biggest in Canada
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:25:49
Coinsquare is a Canadian company based out of Toronto. They recently added credit card purchases. Don't know what the fees. I've purchased a lot of crypto from them and I have to say they customer service is excellent. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:00:54
Definitely get points for style
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:06:31
Awesome. I'm likely not going to need the happy menu but I love hanging out with happy people. I'm going. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:54:54
Forth Cafe. Great spot if you haven't been. Also underground they have Forth lounge where they had live music today. 
And the rooftop patio is sweet too.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:38:06
Not Bitcoin, but a crypto tech could run the exchange in the future and as preciosuly mentioned overstcok is aiming for that market. I tried to get in on the ICO but you have to be a investment professional with certain designations to get it.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:36:47
All depends on your perspective 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:07:14
I've never been but a few years ago, from internet research, it was a mix of drunken westerners, alcohol, drugs, debauchery and lots of jungle. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:02:13
The point of the article is that banks in Canada are at risk of losing a large part of their income stream because a portion of their services can be done cheaper and faster with crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:35:20
My Farsi/Persian needs serious brushing up. Thanks for the article. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:01:35
50K or so. Made some back through swing trading.
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:00:52
That is an action packed schedule.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:18
Don't stress out about it yet. BTC may drop lower and helping your dad might have forced you to sell at a higher price than you otherwise would have. Basically don't stress about selling at the bottom.
And helping family is always a good thing.

ROI and a chance to decentralize currency.

That establishment is has 3 floors and on the weekend it's packed. I see it as free advertising for crypto. Having said that if I really wanted anonymous BTC/ETH/LTC I'd use the machine.

You sir/ma'am have amazing eyesite
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:41:27
You shouldn't have bet your whole account. Watching and reading TA has helped me increase my account in a very moderate way. But it is a game of trade frequency and risk reward/ratio. And never bet the whole bank.
On a brighter note it could still go down from here. Nobody knows; everyone just makes educated and uneducated guesses.

In a few weeks I'm headed to Laos for a few days with my girlfriend. How is VangVieng? Worth the trip?
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:06:59
I've experienced a similar problem at times. 1st step is to check your junk email folder. Another time they were having problems sending to hotmail accounts. Once I switched to gmail the confirmation email arrived promptly. 
In both cases I got a prompt response when I contacted them to trouble shoot.
Good luck.

I just used my ledger... it would be terrible to think it has a flaw.
