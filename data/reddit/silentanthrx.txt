sure, lol.
but I tell you, this lowering is a bit too popularized and will be perceived as market making.
Classic bubble experience dictates that the ppl. following very closely are panicking and selling. then it will get worse when the slow ppl are following. Then it will go up because of oportunists, then it will go down because that uncle at our newyears party panics. then it is spiky. It may go up steep for a little while for a double dip, but i just expect a painfull slide to the bottom.

Agreed, especially book 3, where the government takes a steering role in work creation in moments for decline.
Most irritating part is that politicians always turn keynesian during recession (to implement very loose budgetary and monetary policies) and neoclassical during growthphases. 
Forgetting that the backside of being keynesian means you have a very restrictive policy during growth periods. (effectively hindering growth in favor monetary and budgetary stability)
A growing debt ratio of a nation is hard linked to inflation of its Fiat.

because a couple of months ago the question was "Why 2 months and not 6 months?"
