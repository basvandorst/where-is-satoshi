I've never read the rest of Reddit, being more of a ZeroHedge type.
Signed up just to correct the FUD surrounding Bitcoin.
Reddit: "You heard it here second."

Is it also a conflict of interest for the EFF to use the internet, since they need to be a neutral third party to disputes involving it?
EFF is so fail.  Time for EFF 2.0 (with blackjack, bitcoin, and hookers).

"rather than" &lt;-- This is your problem; it's entirely artificial.
You should have silver, gold, *and* bitcoin.
Bitcoin may or may not be "the currency to end all currencies" but the underlying technology is highly disruptive to the fiat trash being dumped on the markets like so much confetti.

That's right, and the other 10% is shoveled from the bitcoin bbs.

The point is to acquire large amounts of BTC for a lower price when MtGox is down and people sell in a panic.
IOW, Operation April Foolscoin!

Not this stuff again. *facepalm*
We heard it when BTC went from $0.01 to $0.10.
We heard it again when BTC went from $0.10 to $1.00.
We heard it yet again when BTC went from $1.00 to $10.00.
And now get to hear it once more, as BTC go from $10.00 to $100.00.
Nascent markets for disruptive emerging tech are fundamentally different than mature markets for established commodity products.
New things tend to start with big bangs, then slow down.
The universe did 99% of it's expansion in the first second, everything in it will follow the same pattern.

The amazing support demonstrated in the $80s this week bodes well for next week's renewed assault on $100.
There are 1,000s of people waiting in line for the opportunity to put their money in MtGox and spend it on BTC.
There are 10,000s trying to figure out just WTF is a BTC and how do I get some.
There are 100,000s who heard of BTC for the first time this week, and will begin filtering into the first two groups.
ATM, we're in the eye of the perfect BTC storm.

Your threat has zero weight; Bitcoin has already taken off.
Read the words of Holy Ascended Master Satoshi Tzu:
TL;DR: he doesn't like TBTF central bank bailouts.
Also, familiarize yourself with the concept of 'deep regulatory capture.'

Bitcoin is the first implementation of a new technology that is HERE TO STAY FOREVER.
First Instance: May come and go more or less quickly.
Underlying Innovation: Here to stay forever.

Have you looked at weusecoins or the lifehacker how-to?
Give up do not, young Padawan.  The steeper the learning curve, the greater the reward.
So happy too see newcomers grappling with the struggle for knowledge of economic freedom.  
Praise be to Satoshi!

Q: "how in the world are we supposed to trade under these conditions?"
A: 1) use exchanges that are not Gox.  
    2)have your bids in place because you know this happens often
