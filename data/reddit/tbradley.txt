Well if they say to me or in a public forum that they love putting huge sums it will pain them to lose on red then I might point out that's a gambling problem.
I don't care if you find it insulting or not.

Uh, my 1 week reference is to how long Pirateat40 has announced repaying will take. I'm saying I don't see why nanotube would give him longer than 14 days assuming he misses his personal deadline.
If you follow the conversation, orderly shutdown is defined in the bet between Pirateat40 and Vandroiy but no time-frame specifically mentioned. Although a separate section denotes a 14 day period to pay interest and also to disburse withdrawal requests.
@_date: 2012-08-19 03:55:06
I can see that as a valid logical framing. But it is an oversight that the section about shutting down operations didn't specifically reference a time-frame nor did it refer to the interest change section.
nanotube is the ultimate arbitrator. Your reasoning is sound and I'd be surprised if he didn't also give a 14 day closing window.

Well, we can't say for sure what Goat hoped. He was one of the few to hang out with the person claiming to be 'Pirateat40' in Vegas.

Yeah, will have to see how it plays out. I think the market may have gotten away from Pirateat40. In fact I think this is the reason he's shutting down, imo.
With bitcoin being on the rise and so volatile there may be more fiat in MtGox than could normally be expected.For example, I happen to have a bit more than usual and will be looking to catch some BTC if there is a large enough dip.

Yeah, if I was forced to place a bet: I think he's selling off  this last nest egg, at a pace that won't depress the price too low. I mean for all anyone knows he could already be drinking mai tais on a tropical beach.

Even the federal government pauses at suing large corporations. It's expensive and usually a prolonged process. But I do agree with you that getting enough information to sue in case of default should be a factor in the amount given.
@_date: 2012-08-19 02:03:39
The personal bet he made with Vandroiy is slightly ambiguous. He has 14 days to pay without being considered in default. However there is another section that addresses closing down that just says all creditors must be paid without stipulating a payout date. It will be up to nanotube to decide if closing down must not take longer than 14 days or whether Pirateat40 has longer.
@_date: 2012-08-19 02:28:55
I may be missing it but I don't see where he says definitively 2 week timer on closing down. There he is saying a change in interest does not require 30 days notice because possible interest rate changes were already covered in the ToS.
@_date: 2012-08-23 01:59:42
It's going to be tough to get enough evidence that whoever you think Pirateat40 is happens to be the same entity that you sent BTC. Honestly, if he did a runner to another country with several million he's got a pretty good chance of getting away with it all.

More like a gambler. I don't know how much you put in but if you are putting enough in to cause financial pain if you lose it then that's no different than being a gambling addict.

Have to keep in mind these people like to keep their core supporters on the hook for as long as possible. Increasing returns would be too suspicious. Which is why instead he opened it up to everyone recently, instead.
@_date: 2012-08-19 03:43:09
That's different than the announced shutting down of operations. Although, since Pirateat40 has given himself roughly 1 week I don't see why nanotube would grant him more than 14 days total.

Ok, there are lots of ponzis, frauds, and unsound savings vehicles denominated in USD.
@_date: 2012-08-23 01:49:48
Why cast stones about reading comments: "... but if you are putting enough in to cause financial pain ..." - from the comment you seemed to think was insulting you.
If you aren't then you are just regular plain jane gambling.
As to  I'm not some unpaid counselor. They should be seeking professional help.

A deadtree magazine about an electronic currency and unusual cover art. Guess I know what to use if I ever want to go hipster fishing.

The current activity seems Pirateat40 related. Was still over 10 until Sunday. I put in buy orders at low $ amounts Saturday night in anticipation of this.
@_date: 2012-08-19 01:49:23
Hope people don't sell off their bitcoins to Pirateat40 cheaply. Selling of 100K BTC from it's current 11+ish and buying back is probably his main strategy to get enough BTC to return funds. If that plan is thwarted I think there will be a lot of unhappy pirate crew.
Besides, it's bad money management to sell off just because of a large sell order hitting and affecting current price.

A few certainly, but my guess is the vast majority of equipment purchases started after they could start selling fractions of what they generated.

Maybe in some countries they RISKED a lot but in the US they were only risking about ~$0.10/kWh. Pretty laughable risk, imo, unless they were using a Pentium 4 or something.
