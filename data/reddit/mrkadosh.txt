I was traveling in India recently and can say, probably most of the country haven't heard of it, I can bet at the least 50 doubt know about it which is more than half a billion people. probably real percentage is above 70-80 percent don't have a clue

oh right, what I mean is to have like 32MB blocks (or somthing) so that transaction fees will be a cent or so, real huuge mass adoption

As long as that deman as being supplied with a fee (I havent heard of veriblock) then there will be more supply, and better nodes.
as I see it storage is so cheap these days, and bandwidth is so good, that its way ahead of the problematic zone for blockchain size. and it'll probably (very probably) be ahead as long as people continue to use the Internet, 5g Internet etc

so.. you dont know the answer?
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:39:28
everyone knows that, im asking do you know how many MB are needed to reach visas scale (1700 transactions per second)?
actually I just googled that and can do the calculation, if btc does 5 per second and bisa does 1700 then btc needs to be 340 times bigger, so roughly 680 MB.
you see, no need to get all feisty

Awesome, happy to here there is no bad sentiment towards it. as a bitcoin holder I'd like to know its a possibility in some peoples view
@_date: 2019-07-30 21:25:28
i dont know, but I'm sure if well defined someone can come up with an answer.
what do you think is the MB answer to get to visa's bandwith?

calm down, talking about issues and technical matters of bitcoin doesn't require every person making a statment or question to start a fork to prove something
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:04:33
I'm not forgetting nor do I "don't care about decentralisation"
I am simply asking a 100% calculatable question.
going from 2 mb to 32 to 680 is *increasing*the block size, why would you think I would want to delete it?
have you heard of a concept called "theoretical discussion"? sounds like you haven't, you should, because it is one of the processes that surly lead to the creation of bitcoin.

yeah its bein going off for a lot of years, having a day job really makes it hard to also follow the debate and especially the technical parts..
it just seems if I can buy a few terabytes of storage for my pc for real cheap, and my home Internet is so fast, that it shouldn't be a problem, or at least one could calculate the needed storage on a graph and say "if we go with 10MB,we should be fine for 10 years at todays block creation rate"
@_date: 2019-07-30 17:10:27
hmm, thank you very much! it seems a bit beyond my understanding, it seems more reading on the technical side is due

no I dont know, but I assume that with block size bigger than transaction pool, miners will be marginalised, not in a bad way, but if every transaction manages to get in the next block then there is no need to propose a high fee for my own transaction. it wouldn't be zero but it'll be small

most have 4g and a smartphone, even in remote areas, some have a dumb phone.
inflation there is aroind 8% annually (Wikipedia) yet people I talked with had no theory why or if they had it wasn't economically sound in my view.. intersting.
maybe some Indian can tell us more

lightning is not the best solution as opposed to block size. this will age well
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:12:13
it'll be interesting that's for sure
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:49:44
haha awesome reply
