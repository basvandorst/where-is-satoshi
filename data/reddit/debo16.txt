Next dip, I’m in there fam. And if it never dips again for the rest of time, fantastic, I still have some.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:34:48
Up 9% on the month, 45% on the year.
Big picture.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:28:04
Does anybody else just sit there trying to fall asleep and start thinking about things like “If I had bought 10 BTC in January...”
I swear I’m torturing myself and can’t fall asleep just thinking about the opportunity.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:32:43
I learned.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:58:12
Feels shitty. I had a stop loss set at 9.6k and BTC just barely scraped it and it triggered and sold all of it then rebounded to 13k already. Nearly a $10k swing. Feels shitty

Except in 2011, my brother was telling me to buy Bitcoin. He was always eccentric and had his issues but he told us all to buy Bitcoin and we laughed him off as being kooky. He didn't end up keeping any BTC either...
Live and learn and buy bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:34:34
I take it you’re extremely wealthy because you know EXACTLY what bitcoin will do
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:03:24
Me last night. I panic sold. Thousands of dollars just down the drain. Don’t be me. Hollllllllllld.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:12:19
I sold most at 9.7 last night. I’ll say, it hurt. Time and time again, I make a series of smart moves only to erase my momentum in a 30 min panic.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:12:53
That was my missed earnings point. I even told my wife it was up a remarkably substantial amount and she told me it would probably be wise to sell it to protect earnings... I got greedy and should have listened.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:02:20
Haha, I still made 10k in 2017, so I’m not TOO beat up and I can take my loss with that grain of salt. I’m just looking forward to the halvening and the buildup this winter
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:59:46
Not gonna lie, I'm so hoping for this dip to continue. I have a transaction that's going to clear in the next couple days. WANT MORE BTC

Minicrash when all the negative press about China banning trading on exchanges this fall. Recovered pretty quickly.

Because it was 2011. He's still alive lol. He is now the proud owner of 5 feral cats. Still no BTC though I've tried to get him back on it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:37:21
I'm sadly still trying to recover money. Lost about 5000 usd on btc due to panic sales. Hands are firm now

Let's go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over.

Not too painful. He had an incredible life experience and a great wedding and honeymoon with his wife. What’s the point of currency if you can never spend it? Bitcoin gave him this
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:14:45

Pay your taxes and don’t give bitcoin users a bad image.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:50:31
That was a great bad decision!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:30
I was in the same boat. Late nights, wife pleading for me to let it go and come to bed, sold at 17k. This big drop has been relieving to watch.
Wanted so bad for it to make it to 20k, but very okay with cashing out and waiting for all this to end
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:31
I’m not complaining if it’s stable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:38:24
I’m so glad to see the price has fallen. Bitcoin was NOT healthy rising so fast so quick. Some people probably made off like bandits, but I’d much rather see conservative growth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:24:25
This was me in July. It’s a slippery slope and you’ll get hooked! Enjoy the ride!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:38
That’s assuming all 300+M Americans buy it. It has an impact, sure, but if all 300+ bought in, we’d see it skyrocket
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:30
But I’m talking even more so. Even greater exponential rise than what we saw over Thanksgiving. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:19:26
Peace of mind for 10 minutes of BTC growth. Take that trade every time.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:22:28

Do you say "two hundred and two thousand **comma** one hundred and eighty five"? They'd say the same thing. It's just written differently.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:24:17
When it hit $3599.99, I was just staring at my screen hesitating. Few minutes later, it spiked back up and I sold ETH and bought BTC at $3750. Just a few moments is all it takes...

*If yew don't speak Aynglush, you can giiiiit ouuut*
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:15:41
The only thing I could find was [this thread]( detailing the usage. Most of Europe uses the decimal point (.) instead of the decimal comma (,). I don't know, we're debating a pretty weird *point*, I think.
No idea how they speak it. I just know that both are right and neither are wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:30:54
[Not everywhere uses the comma](
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:26:04
Looks pretty solid to hold $3600 at a minimum. Once it hit $3599.99, it was such a spike in buys.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:54:56
Remember. Still +10% on the day so far.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:33:28
Constantly trading is how you end up with tons of processing fees. If you're an outstanding trader who always makes the right calls on when is the high and when is the low, by all means trade all day. I'm going to guess nobody is that clairvoyant though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:40:40
Immediately tried to buy the dip but servers unresponsive.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:52:28
Red candles bad, green candles good. Bottom of red candle best time to make green candle!

I have to honor my stop loss with a family to support. I do believe in the halvening though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:11
I'm with you, friend.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:13:43
I told my wife we needed to save an extra 10k to prepare for a cross country move next year.
This was last week. Already almost there.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:59:20
Nice! I tried but Coinbase problems. Saw that dip and IMMEDIATELY tried to snag it. Alas. Same as before.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:54:16
That's not what I said. I bought BTC because I believe in the purpose and design of BTC. But I'm no fool, I'm not going to watch my portfolio take losses that are preventable.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:26:34
I had a couple price alerts set up. Saw it dropped below $6500!!! Today wasn’t supposed to be a buy day, but here we are!!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:33:04
I did invest more than I was ready to lose, which is the cardinal sin of BTC I know! But I did so knowing the forward momentum of this past week and immediately put the stop loss at the point that was my original investment plus the processing fee.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:18:05
Congratulations, you are now a mod of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:59:54
Tea leaves.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:58:18
Looks like it’s sustaining 8,000 too.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:07:34
I get that. But that’s the risk involved in protecting assets. I could be really aggressive and shoot for the moon, but I’m more than content with just making it to space.
FWIW, already bought back more now that I think this 10.7 support level’s been identified.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:14:15
If it's a government system, by nature it won't be easy to navigate lol.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:28:31
I'm right there with you. I had 1.68 and sold at around a $1000 profit if i recall correctly. My profit would be $5000 right now had I held. I'm going to make the slower march back up to 1.68 and beyond! Believe!
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:54:21
That was me in 2017. Don't worry, you're taking the right course of action. You're enabling a more successful future. This isn't picking up pennies on the ground. This is hundreds or thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:13
I panic ran to my computer so I could BUY BUY BUY. Missed 8700, but caught 9000.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:44:04
When you see bitcoin dropping, go to the Winchester, have a pint, and wait for this all to blow over.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:53:00
Hoping everyone sells, I need more at lower prices!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:57:31
I’ll beat that. Ten thousand AND ONE PENNY
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:48:51
What if we panic bought?
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:37:57
Bad timing lmao
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:46:45
Coming back to admit you were right! Value is the same but now I have .06 less in BTC. A tough lesson, but we try to get better every day.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:25:40
I’m in the Army and when I tell people about the gains, they say “Wow, congrats on the great investment. I wish I knew how to get into that.”
And then I teach them a little. I don’t understand what kind of job OP works at that this is acceptable or appropriate behavior.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:12:02
I was a little bummed when I saw it dropped after I bought above $4900 but then I remembered I only bought .03 BTC ($150) for my weekly buy and my position only changed by $13... Oh. Oh well.

My brother first told our family about bitcoin in 2011. He raved about how great it was and everything about it. He is an alcoholic with a drug-riddled past. We all made jokes about BTC and him. My brother is troubled, but he's not usually stupid. Every time I think about BTC and the past. I get a little sad because if I had just thrown $50 I had sitting around doing nothing in my bank account, I'd have around $100,000 just from taking a chance on my brother's word. None of us understood BTC at the time and dammit we're paying for it now. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:19:10
Can't believe it took me this long to sell. I bought in around 3300 for for around 2 coins. Cashed out with my $500 profit today. Could have been a 2500 profit had I sold at the tip. I think it will get back there, but always buy low sell high. Don't think we've found our next low.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:14:00
A little bit bittersweet for me. I sold my 1.5 BTC earlier in the week because I predicted another dip. I'm proud of BTC for pushing back up there, but feeling that sting of selling too early. Oh well, still net that sweet sweet profit!
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:23:33
Are &gt;$40 swings big news for you?
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:24:16
I actually did panic sell at the top. It was a pretty good feeling. Then I bought back in a much smaller amount and lost it. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:30:38
Dipped my toes in the waters and made my first BTC purchase ever when it hit $1980. Bought $500. Have 10k in savings but didn't want to touch it. Oh well, won't ever go broke selling at a profit.
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:53:28
God I love making money with BTC. I’ve missed this feeling.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:33:39
I think people will start selling once it nears $3000 since thats the highest it's ever been and people will be cautious that it can break through. Then yes... correction.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:51:07
And BTC rising is more money.
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:03:24
"The correction"
10% and like 1 day long.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:36:58
I think it will be more like “Some say it COULD be the money of the future!” [cuts to some CFO of a bank] “We’re not so sure.”
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:14:05
WHEW LAWDIE LOOK AT THESE CANDLES
