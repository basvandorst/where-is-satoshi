I didn't realize the wealth I had when I bought 60 coins at $1 a coin.
I lost the wallet code.
I lost it.
And then when I heard 3,000 but people said "It will correct SO HARD" I waited.
Then 4,000... I just bought $100, and setup autobuy every 2-weeks for $100 on payday.
If it goes low, oh well, if it goes high, oh well. HODL WAS THE KEY ALL ALONG I FEEL SO GODDAMN STUPID I LOST THAT WALLET AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

chickened out and never used them.
site gets shut down
wallet code was linked to account

I figure if I go with my work stock matching program and this, even if I leave this job I have investments that I can take with me. I just feel really foolish that I vaguely glanced at a post that said 3,000 and read a few comments that said to wait so I waited and now its at 4,000. A double whammy for sure, but better late than never.
It also seems a good idea is to just invest smaller amounts more often, so that prompted the auto-buy, so it feels like just another deduction on my paycheck.

Would you say that just setting up an auto-buy on payday for a set amount and just letting that pile up for years and years is a bad idea? I'm still kicking myself for waiting at 3,000 for a drop to start on that.

I waited when people said 3000 would correct.
No longer! I buy tonight!

I intend to invest over time enough to own at least 1 coin, if not more.

240k would easily pay all my debt, buy me a small house I've always wanted, and I'd likely just keep the majority as coins wnd HODL
But yeah, the feds seized the website. They have all the accounts and whatnot.

Well technically they aren't lost, but saved in a wallet stored on a SR account, which I never used because I chickened out. So the feds have it.

$100 to spend, so I am now $100 worth of bitcoins richer in 3-5 business days!

I am kicking myself in the head so fucking hard right now.
I had 60. 60 COINS IN A WALLET.
THAT I NEVER USED.
I got them when I was maybe 18/19 years old, I was going to buy weed with it on SR, but I chickened out and just left them since I didn't know how to sell them and I assumed I'd use them eventually.
And I lost the wallet. Which was linked to that account. On that site. Which is seized. 
And now its worth 4000 a coin.
I just setup autobuy $100 every 2 weeks on payday because I might as well invest in something that could explode again like when I had 60 coins for $60. I feel like I lost a winning lottery ticket.

I had 60 coins, left in a SR wallet, never used. Lost the wallet...
I also bought ~$300 of coins at $4300, sold em at 4700 after a paycut and transfer at work...
Then it hit $7000...
