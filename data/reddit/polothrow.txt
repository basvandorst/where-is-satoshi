Tether runs on the Omni ***bitcoin*** protocol. Tether transactions are fundamentally bitcoin transactions. It was designed to have a dollar-backed cryptocurrency (i.e. *uncensorable transactions*). I figured it would be safe to use tether.to, which runs the redemption and issuance process of tether, and also not have my transactions censored, but I guess not.

Of course they would. They would only make fees several times less while still increasing miner revenue. You *would* be able to spend many of those outputs. Segwit alone can't solve this; you aren't going to be able open a LN channel for the outputs smaller than it costs to open a LN channel (transaction fee).

I was trolling, but your btc are not lost. If all else fails, the transactions will probably fall out of most nodes' mempools within a few days, at which point you can resend with higher fees. If you can get the recipient (or your change address) to send another transaction with enough fees to cover both, then you could probably get the original confirmed pretty quickly.

Did you read the article? Jeff Garzik said he would make SegWit2x compatible

This! People who think we'd be just fine to forever have 1MB, 2MB, 4MB, or even 5KB blocks don't understand basic economics: the 1MB "fee market" is not free, and cannot reach equilibrium because of the supply cap. Therefore, economic activity will move away from the non-free market (BTC) into more free markets with no arbitrary supply cap (e.g. ETH, XMR). Basically users are screaming "WE'LL PAY $10 for even one transaction, please let us in" and miners would (otherwise to the consensus rules) be happy to accept because it costs less than $10. But since it's only 1MB, users will outbid each other until ordinary transactions cost ***$100***.
Mining would be more rewarded, increasing security, with larger blocks because fee revenue would *increase*, not go to zero as some (ahem, constantly insinuate. If you want a real fee market, you have to accept larger blocks. Whether you chose continuous hard forks or something like EC is up to you. Segwit/L2 and larger blocks are not mutually exclusive. They depend on each other to make bitcoin *usable*.
