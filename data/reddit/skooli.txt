Very interesting.  You're right, the price drop could be correlated with this BitStamp problem.  Hopefully we will get more info soon, or maybe we will just be left in the dark like with MtGox.

Get real bro, you don't care about anyone's financial hardship, so stop acting like you do.  All you care about is demonizing Bitcoin, and price is your only ammunition right now.  You are the biggest jerk on here.  People sat at significant losses when the price dropped from $30 down to $2 as well.  Some listened to trolls like you and sold thousands of bitcoins for $5 each and they regret it a lot.  So those trolls that scared people away back then contributed a lot to financial hardships suffered by those today.  But you don't care about facts or reality, all you care about is demonizing Bitcoin.  I wonder who pays you to spend 12 hours a day on reddit trying to annoy people.

Yes I agree, what you say is very true.  Most smart people dont want to buy at an all time high or during the hype cycle.  They are more likely to get involved when the price is "low". So the bubbles are a good thing really.  $285 seemed high before when we were used to $50-$100 prices.  But now that the all time high was $1200, $285 looks much more appealing to newbs.  Sucks that we have to deal with this volatility as it feeds the hungry trolls, but its good for the long run.

Here is a tutorial for cold storage using electrum: 
Your coins will be backed up by a 12 word seed phrase.  Just write them down on paper and put it in your safe, make copies if you like but if anyone gets your word list, they get your coins.

The spirit of Liberty is strong with this one.  I agree bro Bitcoin is about freedom.  You come off as a little crazy, and trolls will have a field day with it, but I agree that Bitcoin is about opting out of the current scam system.  Even if it fails, I feel good about my decision to support Bitcoin.  Its better to fail while striving for liberty and greatness than it is to sit on the sidelines and be a coward and slave to a scam FIAT run tyranny.

Do you mean you gambled it on satoshi dice or just gambling by trading?  Either way its just money man.  Life goes on.  Think about it, even if you lose every cent you ever had, you will be alright.  You won't starve.  Sounds like you made some bad decisions, but even if you lost financially, you gained knowledge and experience.  You can't put a price on that.
Think of people hundreds or thousands of years ago.  They didn't have money either, they probably had to live in a cave, and eat squirrels for dinner every day.  You are far better off than them no matter what, so don't get too down on yourself.

Most of the mined coins are scooped by VCs in agreements with large mining pools so have little effect on price.  They have already been bought up before they were even mined.
The main reason for dump, is lot of fools who wanted to get rich quick bought in during the hype, now they are dumping for a loss.  Similar to how many dumped thousands of bitcoins after the first bubble in 2011 that went to $30, and then crashed to $2.  A lot of people sold off then only to regret it years later.  Similar thing happening now.  Let trolls have their fun and claim victory.  I love to scoop up some more cheap coins.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:16:58
Well I think you are right its a possible threat, but we don't know how ASICs and mining will evolve over time.  One thing I have heard is that sidechains may help at preventing this.  By having sidechains in competition with the main chain, it puts a check on miners from taking over the system and increasing supply past 21 million and stuff like that.  Its because I guess sidechains offer a way out while preserving the Bitcoin value.  Andreas Antonopoulos talks about how the sidechains change the game theory, and help put a check on and prevent mining centralization problems: 
Edit: unfortunately the youtube video seems broken.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:36:21
Well I do believe people will get rich if they buy Bitcoin and many have already, but that is not the only reason I hold it.  I hold it for ideological reasons.  I hate the Federal Reserve scam system, and banker bailouts.  I like freedom, sound money, and a permissionless currency.  
I believe they will make profits if they hold Bitcoin for the long term, then spend it on goods and services.  However if they expect to get rich over night, there is no guarantee of that happening.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:14:46
The timing is a rather strange coincidence.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:53:00
True it all starts with the miners.  But there are also some pioneers who are accepting Bitcoin for goods and services and holding onto it.  They are also spending and using it as much as possible like a real currency.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:40:52
lol, nice.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:33:22
Why would you say that? What was crazy about what I said?
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:39:41
I think its possible.  I believe something like this used to exist on the dark web, but I don't know how legit it was.
You could use things like colored coins to represent shares of stocks, meaning volatility in Bitcoin price wouldnt matter much. However this can lead to centralization, but it still has advantages because of tansparency on the blockchain.  Also its much easier to physically hold the stock, instead of paper stocks most people don't even hold them, which leads to lots of fractional reserve scams. 
Patrick Byrne CEO of Overstock.com has talked about these problems with the legacy stock market a lot. There was a big legal battle between he and others from Goldman Sachs and others because he says they were shorting and attacking the stock of his company to artificially kill the price. He basically says its all a fractional reserve scam, and he tried to get the paper stock certificates for his company but they would not provide them. He is teaming up with the people from Counterparty in the Medici project.  They are going about creating the first crypto stock.  However they have a team of lawyers to handle all of the regulatory aspects, so it may take a while to get going.

Why would I buy your coins for $1k when I can buy them for cheaper other places?
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:17:55
But a higher fee would be incentivized over a smaller fee if the coins were double spent.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:46:18
Ohh I see, well paid trolls do exist, and all it takes is a google search to find countless examples of it being proven in the media, but it was mostly tongue and cheak anyways.  However look at your posts and you spend hours and hours on trolling and demonizing, and harrassing everyone.  Its pretty amazing and sad that someone would do such a thing.  Makes more sense if they are getting paid for it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:42:56
I use it all the time to buy stuff.
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:18:23
I think some have contracts with large buyers before hand.  They get a fixed price for the coins they will mine in the future.  Its kind of like futures contracts for farmers.  They want to take some of the risk out of it, and VCs and others want to buy up the coins from miners before the coins are even minted.

Well I think it solves many problems, some of which we are not even aware of yet.  For one it will help with scalability. Also there are problems with Bitcoin with things like lack of privacy, or slow confirmation times.  Sidechains can solve problems, or offer new features and improvements.  You will be able to use your Bitcoin with these new features for the first time.  It helps with innovation also.  
Right now its hard to get changes made to the core protocol.  But with sidechains you won't need permission to innovate.  Instead of going through the politics of changing the main protocol, you can just create a sidechain and no permission is needed. There can be a free market of sidechains competing against each other and the people decide which ones to use.  Also right now if you want to take advantage of a new feature in an alt-coin its not very practical, because the network effect is so low for these alt-coins. Sidechains seem to change the game, and help bring Bitcoin to the next level.

Its people scared because they bought in for the wrong reasons.  They bought in with more than they can afford because they thought they were going to get rich quick.  It didn't happen quick enough for them so now they are dumping for a loss.  Similar thing happened in 2011 when the price went to $30 then crashed to $2.  A lot of people sold off all of their thousands of Bitcoin and left the Bitcoin world, only to regret it years later.  History repeats itself, we are seeing same thing happen again.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:52:57
Exactly.  I already have 2 friends who never got into Bitcoin before set up Circle accounts today so they can get in for the first time.
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:22:34
Unfortunately I don't, but have just heard some chatter here and there about this sort of thing.  It seems to make sense.  Also I think large buyers put a premium on newly mined coins.  They know for sure that they are clean from illegal activity and stuff like that for one.  Also its kind of nice to have a fresh block of mined coins, they may sell for a premium in the future.  Maybe freshly mined coins have a numismatic value in a way.  Same as probably people would pay a huge premium for the coins mined in the genesis block, just because its cool.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:41:48
Sounds similar to the story of the guy who had over 3,000 bitcoins in 2011.  He bought them all the way up to $30, then when the price crashed to $2 they got mad and sold EVERYTHING.  They could have been millionaires, but they were in it for the wrong reasons, to just get rich quick.  The sooner we shake those people out, the better it will be for Bitcoin in the long term.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:45:00
Depends if those coins are lost or stolen.  If lost, then it may increase the price by making the available supply less.  But either way its a bad PR hit, so price may go down short-term anyways.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:35:24
I really agree with you.  In a world ruled by lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act... but he may be a little drunk too :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:37:42
Trolls don't care about that, they just want to feel like they are winning.  When Bitcoin goes to $5,000 and then drops to $2,500 they will also claim victory and tell us how the price is down 50%.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:50:30
But many people lose thousands of coins on old hard drives and stuff.  If they hadn't lost them, then many of those coins would find their way to exchanges lowering the price.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:25:15
Mining on PC isn't practical anymore.  They have ASIC machines now that mine super fast, making it impossible to compete with just a PC.
A lot of people lost money at MtGox.  It is because they trusted a third party to hold their money.  With bitcoin however, you can hold your own coins, and take the trust completely out of it.  Get a wallet like [electrum]( or a mobile wallet like bread wallet or mycelium.  They will give you a 12 or 24 word list that you right down as your backup, its called a seed.  Don't lose it or you can lose your coins.  
If you want to buy Bitcoins with your bank account, then check out Coinbase.com, or Circle.com depending on your country of residence there may be other options.  Also localbitcoins.com is kind of like a peer to peer exchange where you can buy or sell to other individuals using a variety of methods including meeting in person.  Just be careful and don't do business with criminals or undercover cops.  Some people use localbitcoins to launder money and do scams, so just be careful not to get caught up in that.  If a deal looks too good to be true, there may be a reason.
Also for better security look into cold storage on your funds, or also hardware wallets like Trezor.  Trezor is awesome because it allows you to spend and keeps your private keys offline so its really basically impossible for hackers to get at it.

@_date: 2015-01-05 17:13:37
Ohh I didn't even notice the video in the post.  But yes I actually have seen that cato video before.  He didn't take into consideration that mining pools are made up of different entities which can leave at any time.  Also he didn't address the fact that a mining outfit controlling 51% has no incentive to damage the system in which they make profit on.  Also if there was a 51% attack, I think its possible for the system to be rolled back and fixed, and even block the attackers from participating in the network.  So there is not much incentive to attack it.  I have heard Andreas Antonopoulos say something of the like before.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:55:07
Yeah, so in a scenario of compromised ECDSA, possibly a fix could be written into the code somehow to not allow those coins to be spent unless the user can somehow prove ownership on the blockchain prior to a certain date.  It could be done with another hidden key I guess.  
Then they would maybe tweak it a bit, so that after a certain date if the coins were still not moved, then all you would need is the regular private key.  That way if someone didnt hash their key on the blockchain they could still get their coins back. Does this or something similar sound possible at all?

Depends on how severe the regulations are.  As a community we fought back and played good defense.  We did the best we could, we got them to push the regs back further in time.  Hopefully there will be another comment period and we can push back even more.
Everytime we push back, the regs get less and less severe.  There are negatives and positives to the regulation.  For one its going to inhibit innovation and growth.  But the fact of a looming threat of regulation is already doing this to an extent and keeping businesses from starting up.  So if the regs are finalized and they aren't too horrible, it will spur businesses to start up because now they have more clarity and know all of the hoops they must jump through to stay out of prison.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:02:23
Bitcoin is a bit of a risk, so I just hope he is not the type to get scared and dump it if the price drops a bit. This is a long term game.  Everyone's portfolio is different, but I woud consider putting maybe $5,000 in and wait to see what the price does.  If it drops, then you have a good chance to pick up some more for cheap.  If it goes up, then good you have some profit and you can assess the market at that time if its worth it to buy more.
Coinbase is a good option to buy.  They are a well established company with hundreds of millions in VC funding.  They are licensed and regulated, for whatever that is worth these days.  I would just buy smaller amounts at a time, maybe in the 500-1500 range.  Then I would transfer the coins out to my own wallet before buying more.  You don't want to trust others like Coinbase to hold your coins for very long.  The whole point of Bitcoin is you can hold your own coins you don't need anyone else to hold them for you.  People trusted MtGox before and they got all their coins stolen.
Check out electrum wallet and cold storage, or hardware wallets like Trezor which keep your coin safe from hackers.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:12:31
Yeah its pretty technical to understand.  But theoretically we could have sidechains now already.  From what I understand they would work by destroying your bitcoin, and having cryptographic proof of destruction.  The act of destroying the Bitcoin simultaneously creates a coin on the sidechain.  Its an interesting idea.
But as it stands now you can't switch back from that sidechain to the main bitcoin blockchain.  You would be stuck on the sidechain, and that bitcoin you destroyed is gone forever.  This is called a 1 way peg.  But they are proposing a change to Bitcoin that would allow a 2-way peg where you would be able to switch back from the sidechain to Bitcoin, thus preserving the Bitcoin's value.  Maybe you already knew that.  
But the implementation of sidechains will have a lot of interesting consequences, including possibly allowing an escape plan in case Bitcoin gets overtaken or corrupted.  People could escape Bitcoin chain into a sidechain, while preserving their Bitcoin's value.  This changes the game theory completely, and changes the incentives for anyone trying to corrupt the system.  It seems like it will be a really good thing, but its hard to completely wrap your head around it.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:41:47
True, but its kind of good.  Because then people will stop being dummies and putting all their funds on exchanges.  Also for traders they can start to demand security solutions like multi-sig, proof of reserves, etc...

I am not sure but my experience in the past was often when I sent larger amounts there was no fee at all when using QT/Core.  But that was with older versions.  Also I heard that fees depend on size and amount of "bitcoin days" of the coins being sent.  If the coins are old and a large amount then I heard you don't always have to pay a fee.  
I think its like if you have 1 bitcoin that is 1 day old, then you pay no fee.  But if you have 0.5 btc, it needs to be 2 days old then you pay no fee.  Anyone know if this is true?
