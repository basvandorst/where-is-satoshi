Well, wiki just says the big lawsuits are still pending. I guess we'll see. If it were me, I just wouldn't be sub'ing for a full year.

Just a friendly heads-up...
Every time you say "fiat currency" when you mean money, people see [this guy]( in their mind's eye, and cringe a little.

Conducting business that's genuinely anonymous and safe, always, without any lapses in judgment or process, is hard.

What's "in time?" The answer to your question is to contact them, and if they refuse to deal with it, speak with the legal authorities presiding over said method of fraud in that region.

Frankly, I'm not sure I'd want my salary paid in bitcoin. My income is a fairly stable, reliable thing... and I kinda prefer it that way.

I have to imagine anyone doing tip-worthy street art is likely to spend a lot more time and energy being protective of their work.

Good point. 
Big population of tech savvy people that think they can be the ones that use enough technology to stay safe, maybe?

I was wondering if grooveshark is legit now, but the wiki makes it sound like that's still undecided, with various lawsuits ongoing. I wouldn't buy a long term subscription, in case they're abruptly shuttered.

Even the NSA has to deal with varied degrees of trusted sources. They can only (completely) review so much of any given stack. They simply couldn't vet every line of every application, and every schematic for every part of every device, with total control of all production on both, for everything they use. They trust, to some degree however small, some outside parties.

The button on their donation page says "credit / debit card". The difference is largely transparent to people taking payment.

Let's be honest. Most people *using* bitcoin aren't making real money on it.

That was more 80s and earlier (wood enclusre TVs). Payphones a-plenty, though.

Holy shit. I never knew who wrote it... it was just everywhere. Nicely done, sir. You contributed something to my youth.

I'll do the tldr... ”Technical analysis" is, at best, occasional self-fulfilling prophecy. At worst... fucking hokum.

Erm, looks like Adelson was the CEO until 2010, when Rose stepped in. But anyway, I think you're right that he was there all along. Who knows, maybe he'll pop in here and clear it up.

Yeah, clearly that wasn't the best play, but the underlying reasoning seems sound and it doesn't sound like he cashed out entirely. It's hard to harp on anyone for trying to mitigate risk a little. ;)

Ah... a true believer. I'd be happy to find you a potential triple top breakout in my frosted miniwheats for a mere $100. We'll work out who the 'sucker at the table' is, later.

Not to be insulting to anyone, but I feel like he probably isn't high profile enough to seriously alter the price of btc. Right?
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:49:35
Once upon a time, it was probably a very good idea. Now the math wouldn't work out.

What everyone should have mentioned is that "technical analysis", which is *not* an analysis of fundamentals (though they sound similar), is really more of a cross between holistic medicine and astrology.
