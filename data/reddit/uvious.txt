He wouldn't be forced to abandon anything, there is no malicious intent to sidetrack a persons life for selfish reason.
Most people hope to accomplish great things and theres nothing wrong with opening someones eyes towards such possibility by making them aware of something that has far reaching potential, any good friend should.

With a subject as complex as ECDSA, will we ever see an explanation that can pique the interest of someone who has little to no computer science knowledge? 
This post cleared up (well, kinda) a few questions I've had about bitcoin addresses, however, its made it more apparent that this technology needs to be presented in a less intimidating manner.
Thanks Though.

This should be highlighted in the main post.
Also, research funding in the crypto space is yet unexplored territory, as a researcher yourself, you would be doing a great service to the community by gathering the feedback of this thread to work out a framework of how vital research can be funded via blockchain technology.
Nonetheless, Thank You :)

Say you're someone with skills that don't really benefit bitcoin, you believe in the protocols potential, you have a small cache of money that you wouldn't mind using to seed fund ideas that are appealing.
BitAngels makes an announcement that gives them a bit of credibility..."Wow..i just may be able to fund a really great idea and it may affect lives some day! no more would i need to aspire living in silicon valley to be a part of the worlds next big innovation, bitcoin does really dissolve all the barriers and bullshit that walls the average joe from being a part of meaningful change!"
So you visit the website, click on "Angel/veteran entrepreneur application" and are whisked away over to gust.com where a polite greeting awaits to hamper your hopes...

Your individual net worth or joint net worth with your spouse exceeds $1 million (excluding your primary residence).
In each of the past 2 years, your income has been in excess of $200,000 or your joint income with your spouse has been in excess of $300,000 and you expect the same income level this year.*
Theres likely to be a number of reasons why this is fair and whatnot, however, cant help but see this as very limiting.

Self interest is at the core of all our motivations, if we can change the world in the process, why not?
Would credit the community with being highly aware of your statements already.

According to Kevin, the bitcoin community rallies harder to get more people involved despite the bad press, hence the spike.
The "pratfalls" in this case would be an ecosystem that will never prove sustainable, regardless of price.

Do "speakers" really charge that much to present at these things? 
Does this community still have a fetish to hear buzzwords like "disrupt" "revolution" live? after being willingly bombarded by several videos all over the web that regurgitate the same message over and over again? 
Talk is cheap...companies like media bistro thrive on reaffirming the investments made by amateurs who see bitcoin as a path to massive swaths of wealth.
