Did you actually read the article? It’s reffing to a single company using lightning network.

Not disagreeing with that. But perhaps people should bother to read the article they are commenting on?

FTFY: Dude, its fine to use Coinbase to buy and sell but you should never use an exchange to store your coins. Check out a few of the wallets mentioned in this thread or look into some hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor

Working on a similar thing myself my dude! Ignore everyone who says X already exists or it's the same as X. Everything I've seen so far looks like utter ass except yours. I think people underestimate how much of a difference a decent UI/UX can make! Keep at it!
