I used to mine from my dorm back in 2012.  I was only earning something like .01 BTC every 4 days with my bad CPU miner though with slush’s pool.  So it was really worth not it and I quit after a month, having earned something like $3.

ICOs were basically 100% of the ads I see.  Probably because they know I click on them all, and usually comment at how shitty I think their coins are. 
I am all for alt coins, but it astounds me how many copycats think that *“let’s repeat bitcoin all over again, except this time it’s not open source and we pre-mined half the coins to our for-profit company”* is a valid model that thousands of others buy into.

Bitcoin core v16 is scheduled for a May release and will have SegWit support be the default.  You can build the v16 repository already.  That will help somewhat but really we need Lightning Networks to get fully adopted, and it isn’t easy yet for many people to see how.  
I disagree with the runaway climate change sentiment.  It’s a shame that it is happening but it’s more annoying that it does not have to.  There’s no need to keep increasing miners indefinitely.  We could have just maintained them where they were at 2014 levels. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:53:09
Oh shit. I didn’t even know that they had physical locations.  There’s virtually none in upstate NY so I always thought they were online only. 
I had their venture card and liked it a lot... there were fraudulent purchases once and it was super easy to reverse.  Also another time, an overseas hotel I stayed at charged the wrong currency and they fixed that right up for me too.  So I was happy.  But for my credit card now I’m using the chase sapphire reserve so capital One is back to just a checking acct.

He did.  He went on. 
If miners leave, the difficulty will adjust down, and it won’t really hurt Bitcoin at all. 
Fewer miners does leave susceptibility to a 51% attack but there’s still such a large network that I’m not concerned. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:02:32
Absolutely it does.  What I am asking about is specifically how it *prevents* inflation.  The world certainly values our military, but the private sector operates on its own whims.  ForEx markets move as they see fit.  I fully expect that with the dismantling of the EPA and nearly emptied funding of FEMA, and the insolvency of federal flood insurance, we are a time bomb before billions of dollars of Florida coast get ruined by the great 2020 hurricane.  Insurance companies can’t handle the payouts and we will see a multi billion dollar bailout, funded by freely printed fiat.  
This is just one example.  There are dozens of possible “too big to fail” scenarios that will make the private sectors and forex markets diminish the value of the dollar. 
We just passed a tax bill that will collect 1.5 trillion fewer revenue dollars that would go toward paying our debt.  Will it pay for itself? Time will tell, but it might not.  
The world may need our currency but they won’t sit by idly forever as our government prints it off freely and doesn’t manage the debt ceiling.

Well sure you can say it.  You have that right.  And correct, saying something is worth $100bn does not mean it is. 
But if someone *pays* that much for it? Well, yeah.  Then that’s the price.  If there’s an exchange that regularly buys and sells at these prices, then that’s what it is worth. You might not like it but that’s how market value works. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:03:00
...yes.  And it has always been planned, and will always be okay.  It makes no difference.  
Supply &amp; demand will always dictate how many miners there should be.  There will be a “market value” for them, and that is perfectly okay.  
Large mining operations pay very close attention to their electricity bills.  Like I said earlier, if it is not profitable to mine, some will exit.  Simple.  Fewer miners makes it more profitable for everyone else.  
Think of it this way with an extreme example; if tx fees were minimal and rewards were nonexistent, imagine that every single miner in the world quits.  What would *you* do?  Fire up an old GPU miner and start getting rich off of 100% of the (small) tx fees, of course!   As would I.  And as would thousands of others.  And as such... the number of miners will always “settle” around a quantity that is acceptably profitable to them. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:25:59
I disagree. Every line of code is completely open source and agreed upon by the community. 
Unless you’re talking about people with a lot of money practicing market manipulation, but it’s not more than a conspiracy theory.  The exact same opportunities exist in other financial markets and its proven to be barely more effective than random chance.

I disagree strongly with the others here.  It is absolutely wasteful.  The network is good and strong but I feel like it’s excessive. 
There’s nothing we can really do.  It would be good if we could reduce the miners by half.  There’s a lot of speculation that bitcoin mining might help fuel the renewable energy sector. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:51:34


There is virtually no requirement for coins to get harder to mine.  The difficulty adjusts upward based on the number of active miners.  If newbie miners stopped joining on board, then the difficulty would remain absolutely flat.  And if transaction fees decrease, perhaps mining isn’t as profitable, and some may exit.  This makes the difficulty drop. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:09:05
Increase in miners DOES result in increase of blocks per minute, but only temporarily.  Because a difficulty adjustment will follow in the next blocks, to handicap it, and adjust the rate as needed until it settles back to “normal” of one block every ~10 mins. 
As for 1 CPU... maybe that’s a little extreme, but you’ve also got to realize that the difficulty would be set to extremely low / nonexistent.  So that 10 khash/sec might be enough to actually cover it.  But I suppose there is a lower floor minimum, maybe 100 CPUs is a better example of a still-paltry low amount of hashing power that could more than support it.  
Difficulty would plummet, and the 100 CPUs would still churn out 1 MB blocks every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:33:52


I disagree, almost all of the mainstream news was extremely bearish and skeptical.  It was all of the *non*-mainstream news, new crypto blogs, and your friends' facebook statuses that were talking up the 1000% gains.  There would be 1 person sitting at a roundtable on CNBC bullish on bitcoin, while 3 others tell her to stay away.


I don't think new exchanges influence a new influx of cash.  New cash only comes from new investors, or existing investors who are ready to up their game.  New investors did not suddenly say "oh boy a new exchange?  now I *have* to get in!"  Existing investors were possibly encouraged by the new exchanges and happy to have competition, but they would have added cash regardless.


Yes.  I agree with you.  But I don't see this as relevant; having lived through virtually every all time high, even back to the initial $35 craze, they all felt the same.  ATHs get burst through, people buy rapidly, correction, lull period, slow creep return.  $20k behaved the same way, and considering how fast we charged through $7k up through $17k, I think people saw $20k as the next milestone to the moon. 


Yup.  This bear market is going to last for quite a while.  I fully agree.  There needs to be same major breakthrough to turn it around, we are on a slow bleed.  Until some company pulls forward with some remarkable bitcoin credit card or something BIG, we fall.




Disagree.... BTC advocates are nearly 100% of people that put money into BTC.  Yes, there are a tremendous number of day traders and speculators.  But I think ultimately they are all crypto enthusiasts, or else they'd stick to the classic investment vehicles.  Day trading on traditional securities is still alive &amp; healthy.  I'll bet most crypto day traders do keep a bit of crypto stashed to the side and would like to see its long-term health.


Yes but this is kind of 'no duh'.  Prices only move when volume happens... in virtually every stock &amp; bond &amp; futures contract in history.  More volume = more movement.  Right now the HODLers stopped re-upping and they're just chilling out.


Agreed. There's an old saying in finance regarding semi-strong market theory of information: "If people know the price will go up tomorrow, then the price will go up today."  And also the reverse is true.

@_date: 2018-01-08 21:26:32
No problem, I will try to help explain it where the videos may have failed...
Transactions are queued up in the mempool.  The mempool is our collective queue of all transactions.  Blocks have a fixed size limit of 1 MB so they can only hold a capped number of transactions.  There are currently 122 MB of transactions waiting in the mempool.  It will take 122 blocks to clear them all out *if* new transactions can stop being added (but they just keep coming).  Every tx in the mempool can set its own fee.
A miner's job is to scoop up the top 1 MB of transactions with the highest fees and solve them into the next block.  There only ever needs to be one miner for this to happen.  (But for security and decentralization reasons, the more the merrier!)
We want blocks to be mined on a fixed schedule of once every ~10 minutes.  The 'difficulty' is an arbitrary setting that automatically adjusts in order to keep this schedule.  'Difficulty' has nothing to do with mempool size or tx fees.  It exists purely as an obstacle to make blocks harder to mine, just so that we don't mine all 21 million BTC in minutes.
If you had only one miner and then 10 more miners join, you don't want all of the blocks to suddenly be mined out every few seconds.  So the difficulty is built-in to the code to automatically adjust based on the total hashing power of the network.  It makes blocks harder to mine by increasing the length of random hashes that need to be brute-forced.
If no new miners ever join, then the difficulty remains stagnant.  But it does not affect the ability of a miner to clear out the mempool.  The same transactions remain in the mempool, volume is the same.  
And if a large number of miners exit, the difficulty drops.  But the rate &amp; speed in which transactions are cleared from the mempool is unaffected.  
There is no requirement for the number of bitcoin miners to continue to increase, no requirement for the hashing power to go up, no requirement for electricity consumption to climb.  But it does, because everyone &amp; their brother wants to be a miner and join.

I hope so.  It’s a fun time to dream. I used to have 100 btc back in late 2012.  But I had spent them all on about 25 hits of LSD, I was pretty sure.  But when BTC was on the 2017 run, I still dug out my old hard drive to fire up the wallet and check if I had been smart enough to just leave one or two measly BTC in there.  It was a wild thought for a couple hours while the wallet got verified. But nope, my ass was too “smart” to ever discharge an old pc without emptying all the crypto off it first, even if it was only worth $5.

Poor analogy.  In the case of agriculture, water has a linear relationship with output.  More land + more water = more crop yield. 
In bitcoin, that linear relationship is not there.  Number of blocks mined per minute &amp; transaction volume is not related to electricity consumption.  Strictly technically speaking, all mining could be done by one CPU.  
More miners simply gives us more resistance to a 51% attack, but that’s it.  A 51% attack was never executed even years ago when the network was much smaller.  If mining was back at 2014 levels we’d still be in the exact same place right now, but with far less wasted energy.

Right now the USD is worth about .89 EUR.

At what point do the guns kick in?  Really, I’m curious to know. 
Let’s say it falls farther.  Other countries stop trusting our currency, and were defaulting on debts, and the rest of the world wants to offload their USD.

But that's exactly the kind of sentiment that damages dogs at shelters everywhere.  Most people won't look, because they see comments like this that reinforce the belief that shelters are nothing but pit bulls (which are awesome too btw).  It's just plain not true.  I follow some local shelters on facebook and they are *constantly* posting pictures of border collies, beagles, purebreds, and all sorts of breeds.  Plenty of them &lt;1 year old.  They are not that rare.  Awesome breeds are available all the time, luck does not play that big of a role. Especially if you are patient and willing to wait &amp; check for a month. Don't dissuade people from looking...
We all know that shitty people will adopt a new 'oh so cute' breed, then after a year they get tired of them and drop them off at the shelter, because they aren't willing to actually care for the dog.  Where else do these dogs end up?

I’ve written my congressman many times on different issues, I’ll happily join a big campaign to get them to vote no on the crypto ban. No guarantee that it will work, and regulation is a super real possibility.  I definitely don’t disagree that regulation could be the end of bitcoin.  But I do think that the way you say it would play out is silly.  A crash would not prompt the ban; tax evasion would.  And if people could deduct major crypto losses on their taxes, then the government might not want to open that possibility.

The mempool is like a traffic jam on the freeway.  
The cars at the front of the freeway are moving along and exiting.  These transactions are cleared out at a fixed rate (approximately 1 MB per block, roughly 6 blocks per hour).
There are new cars getting on the highway constantly and getting clogged up.  
In the past 24-48 hours we have had a huge surge in transactions being added faster than they can be cleared out.  
But eventually they will be cleared out.  If the rate of new transactions being added can stay lower than the rate of transactions being processed, we can have a net decline, and clear out the backlog. 
No additional hashpower is required.  The hashing difficulty is strictly adjusted only to keep blocks mined on schedule at the appropriate pace.  It has nothing to do with transactions or mempool backlog AFAIK.

This may be an unintentional problem with the way you phrased the comment, but let's be real.  To say "always".... are you implying that you've never met anyone who hasn't regretted adopting a shelter dog?  How many have you met?  Lol the vast majority of people love their rescues.  My rescue Australian Cattle Dog is absolutely playful, energetic, smart, active, and awesome.  
I dislike the narrative that dogs only end up in shelters because something is wrong with them.  Overwhelmingly, it's because something was wrong *with their original puppy buyer*, who was unwilling to care for them.  They come in all sorts of varieties and personalities.


It's just very sad that the dogs in the shelters will either live out their days in captivity with no family to love, and in most cases they will be euthanized.  It breaks my heart.  Meanwhile, each puppy store (and there are dozens per state) is churning out 1000s of puppies a year as a commodity, as fast as they can, and people are willing to spend $3000 + $2000s in first-year vet visits surgeries and specialized puppy care needs.  They have every opportunity to save a dog's life and reduce the number of strays in the world, but instead they choose to exacerbate the problem by encouraging higher puppy production.  
If demand from pet stores decreased, then over a macroeconomic time frame, the number of breeders in operation would gradually slow down, and we'd have fewer dogs that ultimately end up in shelters in the first place.

Thanks for being reasonable.  I see your point and it definitely is valid.
Like so many other people here, I've owned hundreds of BTC since 2011, and I don't even get the slightest bit bothered by +/- 30% swings.  I've seen dozens and dozens of them, haha.  I suppose I am more relaxed from my perspective, because whether the price is $12k or $19k I am still way way way positive in returns.
You're the first person to say that the reason we are supposed to hate Coinbase is because everyone believes they *caused* the recent dip.  I had not known that they were our designated scapegoat, so that makes sense.  I disagree with it of course, I like Coinbase very much, but now I see the justification.
In my humble opinion, Coinbase can &amp; *should* go ahead and add support for Namecoin, Monero, and every other altcoin under the sun.  Even BCH, and Bitcoin Gold, and any other shitcoins.  I don't think they're slinging hundreds of millions of dollars to trade for themselves, so I don't think they are responsible for where the price moves.  I disagree with the sentiment that adding BCH support is what singlehandedly corrected the price of BTC, ETH, &amp; LTC simultaneously.  
But I appreciate you informing me of what the Coinbase haters believe.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:45:21

They aren’t.  I don’t see it that way at all.  It’s just volume.  It’s like viewing a massive traffic jam on the highway, and saying car manufacturers are responsible.  It’s just the raw quantity of transactions that’s got us in this mempool mess. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:39:03
Regarding 'people lost tons of money', I personally believe that to be tenuous at best.  BCH was selling for ~$200 iirc at the time of the August fork, but when Coinbase added support it was worth $2k+. I would assume most people made a lot of money through this, but because of opportunity costs &amp; present values, I understand that it is debatable to say people lost out on potential money they could have made.  I think the majority of users who had BTC in August just logged into their Coinbase accounts and found several thousands of free dollars.  That's pretty sweet.
And 'no warning?'  They publicly announced [in August]( that they would be working on adding support.  I also have a direct email announcement from them in August saying BCH support is being added...
And insider trading is only illegal if there is *actual trading*.  If internal Coinbase employees profited by buying lots of BCH first before support was added, that could be a problem.  But that's just conjecture; we don't have any real info that Coinbase employees traded on this inside info, do we?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:00
Yuck.  You’re technically right, but it just isn’t a concern, flat out.  Bitcoin can be backed up.  And it is infinitely divisible.  As long as there is still a fraction of a coin out there, it is recoverable.  
Not to mention that failed hard drives and “thunderstorms” do not fully erase hard drives; if someone is motivated enough to spend some money on professional data recovery, they could recover their wallets.  There’s a great hacker convention video where a dude talks about physical ways to destroy hard drives and how they were still able to recover some data even after surprisingly strong fires, gunshots, baking, magnets, and more. 
But regardless... yes, every bitcoin will eventually disappear, but are we talking thousands of years? 
Every bitcoin will disappear in the same way that every copy of James Cameron’s movie Avatar will disappear.  I can’t say that you’re wrong, but it’s *really* not the best opposition point, there’s about 1000 more pressing arguments to be made against bitcoin and that’s just not it.

But supply and demand is what fuels this all.  Think macroeconomics instead of micro.
Imagine if the number of pet store sales plummets by 75% in 2018.  These pet stores view their dogs as inventory, commodities, and profit.  If the market for buying new dries up, the pet stores lose money.  They don't want unsold puppies.  They order fewer puppies from their breeders.  Breeders can't turn as much profit so many of them exit the industry.  Fewer dogs in circulation means fewer dogs wind up in shelters to be euthanized without a family.  
Yes, the excess dogs that were bred in 2018 would be homeless.  A necessary evil, sadly.  But the effects on 2019 would be spectacular moving forward.
Even if you're an excellent pet parent who bought new from a pet store, you still helped fund and feed the whole industry.  
More important than the vote you cast on election day, is the vote you cast with your dollar.  Every dollar you spend is your vote saying "this is who I support, this is how I want the world to be, and this is who I want to have power in it."  So it is part of the problem.

Everybody has a target price of what they think 1 BTC is worth. 
The market price at any given time is a reflection of the consensus between all of these different target prices. 
More people have been joining the market with a higher target price and that drives the price upward.

I’m exhausted of hearing that the US dollar is backed by the military.  Can you explain what exactly that means?  
Every time I hear it, I picture some scenario in which the global economy says *“we don’t regard the USD as very strong against other currencies”* 
and our military somehow says *“no we will bomb every country on earth unless you call our dollar valuable?”*
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:47:08


Okay, so the dollar can’t fall in value because the military will invade literally every country &amp; entity, public and private, that doesn’t want to value it highly enough.  Got it...
So it leaves me with a question, right now the GBP and EUR are worth more than the dollar.  What is the limit on how strong they’re allowed to get before we invade the UK and Europe?  
Foreign exchange rates fluctuate constantly, beyond the power of what the us government can dictate.  If the us hits a recession and the dollar weakens, then our buying power is less, globally.  I don’t see how the military backs that.  I don’t see how the military can prevent an economic collapse if people begin to lose confidence in the dollar.

... in what way can military strength give the dollar its value?  That’s silly.  Foreign exchange rates are based on the private market moving the spot price.  If it becomes clear in the coming decades that we will never pay off our national debt, do you know what happens?  The creditors holding that debt sell it off.  People sell their dollars for their country’s local currency.  Does the United States just say to the world “Keep acting like our dollar is still valuable or we will shoot you! With our military funded by the same dollar!”
Venezuela’s economy and Bolivar has completely collapsed.  Everyone in the world, domestically and abroad, agrees it is worthless.  As a thought exercise, pretend Venezuela is suddenly gifted with a military that is equal in strength to the United States’. It is now “backed by men with guns”.  Tell me, in detail, the steps they could take starting today to convince the world their money is valuable, and why their soldiers &amp; civilians don’t instantly convert their paychecks to anything else they can possibly get.  It’s pretty hard to get your troops to follow your orders if you pay them in Monopoly money, no matter how strong their equipment is.  It’s pretty hard to import fuel, energy, and other resources if you’re only offering other countries a collapsed currency.

Oh yeah, well I suppose it varies based on exchange and their rules.  So yes, leaving any fractions of a coin behind on an exchange that prohibits small withdrawals is bad news bears.
your best hope would be to add funds to the account, and then transfer them all back out... might lose money in the process depending on fees.
I don't like being unable to control my fees personally.  On the purchase of bitcoin from an exchange, I totally get it, the exchange wants confirmations.  But to send bitcoin from an exchange wallet to another BTC address?  I don't see any reason they should care what fee you set.  In this type of transaction there's no loss to them if the tx takes 6 blocks or 6000.

That’s just military strength.  You’re absolutely correct that no other country can boss us around because we have the best military on the planet.  That’s very clear.  China can’t strong arm us into doing any bullshit thanks to our military strength. 
But I still don’t see how that’s related to an economically strong dollar.  Foreign exchange markets move in price just like all other securities markets.  Right now the dollar is regarded as quite strong and the economy is doing well, but if the economy hits a recession and the dollar grows weak, the guns don’t really play a role.  
Saying the USD is “backed by guns” seems akin saying “we cannot possibly have another Great Depression as long as our military stays strong.”  Unless I am grossly misinterpreting your point.  I fully agree that having a strong military is critical to our defense and survival, but I don’t see how it protects our financial economy in any way.

I'm a firm believer in BTC and agree that BCH is shitcoin.
I am not here to promote shitcoin cash.
Don't even know why you're dragging them into this.  
I play around with shitcoin cash purely because it was gifted to me by Coinbase as FREE MONEY, that I am just day trading with.  I do not believe in the longterm future of shitcoin cash, and if you read my comments, you'll see that I am mostly very negative toward it.  It is my FREE MONEY that I tinker with for fun, nothing more.
This is a thread about why we hate Coinbase.  I've had an account with them since 2012 and I've been a very happy customer for all of that time. I like them as a good exchange and think they have done very good things for the world of Bitcoin.  For **over 5 years** we championed them as the best place for newbies to get started to buying their first crypto.  It seems like a distant memory but there was nowhere better, more secure &amp; stable, based in US soil, for us to buy after Mt Gox.
I was asking questions about why we are abandoning Coinbase and saying that they're literally Hitler.  From my perspective they have offered good service to me for many years and I am happy with them, and I think that withholding BCH from users who rightfully were entitled to it would have been the WRONG thing to do.  I am pro-Coinbase.

I don't speak for anyone else here but myself.  I have seen that subreddit do virtually nothing but be the purest definition of 'haters' for the past 4 months; nonstop posts about and why BTC needs to die.  It kind of rubs off that we eventually bite back.
I own both coins as a result of the fork, though I don't believe in the long term success of BCH.  They cling to the original whitepaper of Satoshi as if it was an infallible Bible, never to be improved upon or modified.  As if s/he had 100% of everything **perfect** the first go around when they developed the Satoshi client - as a proof of concept!  
BCH's refusal to suffer even a temporary period of high fees &amp; transactions while we await widespread SegWit adoption so that Lightning can be built on top is shortsighted.  If BCH wants to handle 10,000x more volume, they simply intend to have 10,000x bigger blocks (80 GB? to download every ten minutes, even in regions with poor broadband?).  It's not a long term fix but they resist change.  
The current BCH 7-day-avg-volume of 60k/day is providing low fees &amp; fast confirmations at 8 MB block sizes. The payment network Visa achieved 47,000 peak transactions per second on its network during the 2013 holidays - 4 BILLION per day. We can't just increase block sizes by 67,000x (times 8 MB) in perpetuity if we want to overtake them. It is essential &amp; imperative that we find a solution to have off-chain instant transactions.  Thousands of other cryptos offer tiny fees &amp; tx times.  BTC is building a totally new alternative, while BCH shits on us constantly for being in a temporary slump.  Think long-term, macro scale.  High fees &amp; mempool are a temporary blip on our projected timeline.
I am skeptical of the whole BCH thing because the fork was strongest opposed by miners whose ASICs would not be compatible with the new coin.  They had a lot of skin in the game and resisted the fork.  We had nearly 90% of the best &amp; brightest people/developers/miners in the network support the change based on CONSENSUS.  Not whether or not their personal hardware would still earn revenue after the software improvements go through.
It's like a Rockefeller company who owns a coal-powered electricity empire, vehemently opposing any type of alternative energy research, on the grounds that coal was what was outlined in the original 1904 Municipal Electricity Policy.  We don't need to worry about long-term sustainability when we can just keep increasing coal usage forever!  Fuck Lightning networks because they are still in a research &amp; testing phase -- might as well give up!
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:36:48
BCH is at 8MB blocksizes already and the volume is an absolutely tiny baby compared to what 'primetime' as a widespread currency would look like.  BCH will easily require 2GB blocksizes if it even wanted to handle transactions for just one US State.  ISP bandwidth and infrastructure just can't take it.  What will BCH raise block size to when it wants to be a global currency?  The only permanent long-term solution is to get off chain.
I agree with a temporary block size increase, however.  That was part of the initial SegWit proposal.  But CoinBase already promised:  SegWit support is coming in 2018: 
So we might get our dropped fees soon enough.

My brother bought me a bitcoin for Christmas a few years back for $90.  I gently tried to talk him out of it because I thought the price was stupidly overpriced and he was wasting money on me.  
I had about 70 BTC when they were ~$3, sold them when they set a new ATH at $33, breaking the old ATH.  I was talking big in the IRC channels telling people how stupid this recent price run was lol. 
My bro had been listening to my conversations about it all year and finally decided he wanted to make a Coinbase account and buy me a bitcoin.  I was like “aw geez... that’s super kind but you missed out, it’s too high now.....”. But boy am I glad he went through with it. 
Bitcoin went on its famous run up to $1100 and I had managed to sell around $700.  I treated my brother to a fun night with the money.
Guess I should have held, hindsight is 20/20, but there’s 1 million stories like mine. 
I don’t know where I was going with this story but it fits the theme of the comic.  Times really haven’t changed.  $14,000 feels just as surreal as $90 felt back then. 
Some day we will be at $150.000 and $14k will feel as long gone as $500.

You’ve got 62 possible characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z) that can be in 52 spots. 
You’re looking at 3,224 combinations for brute forcing. 
That’s an interesting conundrum.  I could write a script that outputs every possible address well enough, but I would get stuck on the part that tries to load it as a valid private key.  I don’t know of an API or anything that can check that.  (It certainly could exist, I just lack experience on that).  
If you’re able to make 3224 attempts at importing a private key on blockchain then maybe it could be feasible (after 1612 guess on average)

Your comments about “let’s just wait 2 years for something that might not work!” Sounds identical to someone clinging to fossil fuels saying “pfft, let’s just cling to this pie-in-the-sky alternative energy sources that might not even work! So there’s no point in investing them!”

There’s a quote somewhere out there about history repeating itself...
We’ve been on fiat since 1970. Check out any inflation graph in that time. 
Are we the first fiat currency? No, there have been over 500 of them in history.  Their average lifespan is 28 years.  We are approaching 50.  
Every time the debt ceiling gets raised, the value of the dollar drops.  Every time a hurricane hits the coast and we have to extend billions of emergency debts that we don’t have, the value of the dollar drops.  Every time we get involved in a foreign military conflict over a silly twitter war... you get the idea. 
In my lifetime alone, we’ve had two major events where banks have nearly crashed our economy.  It’s astounding how close we came.  And yet people think the dollar is infallible. 
With Brexit in the EU, and France’s election *nearly* causing them to withdraw, we might have seen the Euro collapse. 
But not the US Dollar! Our bankers have finally learned their lesson, and we are impervious to every other failure in history, and our elected officials would *never* install a cronie in the Fed who makes mistakes.  Right? 
Major natural disasters are *not* getting more common, so we can cut FEMA’s budget, I’m sure we will be just fine if 200 miles of Florida coast gets demolished and the monolith insurance companies can’t pay out.  We will just worry about that later. 
I’m sure a $1.5 trillion tax cut won’t affect other countries’ perceptions about our ability to pay off our mind boggingly massive debt.

Mainstream adoption will be when money transfer services are relying on bitcoin/blockchain without the users even having to know it. 
It is not mandatory for them to understand the tech, or even care.  Understanding the tech can help faster adoption, but ultimately that will be the burden of software developers &amp; the private IT sector. 
Millions of people every hour use their credit cards; they don’t have the slightest need to understand the precise tech behind how transfers are made, where banks conduct currency exchanges, what an ACH Bank Deposit specifically does in detail, what a chip reader at a credit card terminal is actually doing.  
We can have a surface-level understanding that these things *exist*, but ultimately it’s not necessary to know what a SHA256 is or what SegWit does in order to swipe a bitcoin-powered credit card. 
That’s when we know bitcoin is really gearing up.  When a startup makes a viable bitcoin credit card, and merchants begin to accept it because the fees can be much lower than what AmEx or Visa charge.  And users can sign up for the card without ever needing to even *know* it is powered by bitcoin (although I’m sure that would be a great marketing focal point).
Also, this is being crazy hyper optimistic, to-the-Moon best case scenario, likely impossible:  the four major credit cards handle about $40 trillion of transactions each year.  With 21M bitcoins to be mined, could we potentially see a $2,000,000 per bitcoin (~$42T market cap) in order to support &amp; replace this?  Almost certainly not, but boy is it fun to consider!

That’s where you’re wrong kiddo.  Segwit and lightning networks are about to roll out and transform BTC in a big way.  Block sizes would still be at 1 MB but Luke Jr is estimating that we’d barely need 10 kB.  
People are betting that these changes will deliver on the hype.  Startups around the globe have been gearing up for years.  We’ve had Bitcoin ATMs in production that are now being mass produced.  There are companies working on bitcoin credit cards.  Baby, we’re just getting started.  These will be more common 5 years from now (lots of legal red tape is finally being cleared).
Once we have lightning network on the nodes, we could see transactions happen just as quickly as credit cards.  
And we could have fees that plummet to dirt cheap, we’re talking 0.1% or less.  Every merchant would love to accept a BTC card, compared to those bastards at PayPal that charge 3.5%+. 
And do you know what kind of market cap credit cards have?  Visa handles something like $17 trillion, MasterCard does $14 trillion. Recalling from memory.  Bitcoin still is a baby and needs to grow several times over, if it wants to match these giants. 
That’s why the price is surging. 
(And at the risk of damaging my credibility with a tinfoil hat theory, I think there are also billions of dollars worth of bitcoin being moved around by some global superpowers including Russia, but that’s largely unfounded)

Pets.com can be massively in debt. Pets.com can file for bankruptcy and never get a second chance. 
Bitcoin does not have that.  Sure, there are leaders and big players.  But if they fall, others can take their place.  There is no centrally audited statement of revenue. 
Bitcoin always has a huge potential.  It will persist through a massive crash, and eventually slowly creep up. Because people will realize that the tech behind it is still promising.  
Bitcoin cannot file for bankruptcy.  Bitcoin does not carry debt.  Bitcoin will always keep on chugging along functioning happily on its own tech, totally independent of whatever its USD exchange rate is. 
I think that is what makes our “bubble” very different than when people compare it to beanie babies and dot coms.  Our “bubble” is one that can *certainly* pop, but it seems likely to always reinflate.

It’s a great situation and a good party they have over there right now. I just feel it’s shortlived.  I saw that post of the year’s worth of storage earlier.  But that’s only at current volumes and block sizes...
I can only assume BCH aspires to grow many orders of magnitude larger in 2018.  We might see 16MB, and 32MB blocks.... and hard drive space will still be acceptable.  
But these are short term visions.  I try to view long term. I am thinking 10+ years, and even 100+ years.  If you want to create the next “gold standard” we need to have a very far-reaching vision that can last a dynasty.   
I don’t know when BCH will hit its critical threshold but at some point in the next few years, it is likely that the bandwidth of your internet lines in Guatemala cannot actually download the 100GB every 10 minutes that BCH aspires to.

Bullish in short term, because I still think it will go up from its current price, like I said (twice, mind you) I'm a day trader with my free BCH.  Longterm it will crash and burn.


Which you no doubt saw, as you carefully overlooked and cherry-picked dozens of my negative comments in search of one that was a speculator's day trading context.  Any onlookers here can easily find many anti-BCH posts in my recent comments.  I've got a BCH limit sell order sitting at $4k right now and have every incentive to pump those people up into buying up to that price.
In any case I am done with your arguing.  I'm not a troll.  In all likelihood I have been using BTC longer than you.  Not that it gives me more credibility, I understand, but that's why it offends me to say I'm trolling.  
I just like Coinbase and I find it unfair to say that they caused a correction across all of the major cryptos just because they added BCH support for their users.  Redditors here seem to be under the impression that there was a panic like, *"Coinbase added support for BCH?! Oh no!  Everybody panic sell ALL crytpo!  ETH, BTC, LTC, it's all gotta go!  Crash the market because Coinbase added BCH support!"*  And I think that's crap.  That's all my original 'concern trolling' comment was asking; is this *really* what you guys believe?

It’s always a risk.  The trick is finding a website that has built up a solid reputation from many users that you feel you can trust.
Shapeshift.io is not a coin tumbler but it functions as one.  You can change one crypto to another entirely, and then change it back.  Send them BTC and receive LTC, and then repeat in reverse.  Your original coins will get lost on some other chain, and you receive a fresh batch in return.  Minus fees.

Theoretically, downward.  It does not add significant burden for a miner to process additional transactions per block as long as there is some nonzero fee involved.  A miner should accept any and all transaction fees, even those that are fractions of a cent.  A saturated marketplace with many miners should drive the transaction fees downward.
What is happening is collusion, because there is an incentive not to accept the lowest transaction fees.  It only works if the majority of miners agree to not process anything above a minimum fee.  Again in theory, an independent miner could then come in and scoop all of the small fees up.  But we are not seeing enough competition among miners.  Mining is prohibitive now without large equipment investment, so it is not happening.
There is money to be made for anyone who wants to enter the mining game and accept *all* transaction fees,  which should drive them back downward.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:04:53


Let me stop you right there and point out that it already succeeded. Unless the ambition is to replace fiat entirely, in which case it will fail. 
As long as there is a need for one party to send large sums of money to another with near-negligible transaction fees - and there always will be - then there is a demand for Bitcoin. 
As long as there is a market for people wanting to securely send money anonymously, worldwide, instantly - and there always will be - then there is a demand for Bitcoin. 
And as long as there are unstable economies failing, with citizens looking to run on the banks and convert their currency into more immediately available than gold - and there always will be - then there is a demand for Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is already a global success and can only continue to grow in popularity.  Even if the BTC/USD spot price plummets, that is not a failure.  Bitcoin is here to stay.

Currency exchange rates are moving all the time, of course.  “The dollar has collapsed” does not necessarily mean totally worthless.  For example if we just hyperinflated the USD by printing money to pay off our debt, it would devalue the dollar by about 80%.  1 EUR = 6 USD kind of thing.  It’s still possible to function just fine, it just means any company that buys or sells internationally will be having a tough time.
My point is that there’s more than two options.  It isn’t just USD keeps current value OR is completely worthless.  There is a whole spectrum of valuations inbetween there that we can likely see.

@_date: 2018-10-10 15:41:06
I disagree, but I always enjoy having the discussion.  It depends on how much SHTF we are talking.
We've been through economic collapse before.  The Great Depression was really, really bad.  Overwhelming unemployment, long hungry lines at the soup kitchen, the masses were dirty &amp; hungry and utterly poor.
And yet, society did not degenerate into a murderous wasteland with blood &amp; ammo as the new currency.
All around the world, even today, we point to examples of collapsing economies (Venezuela, Greece).  And furthermore, there are examples of countries with *hundreds of millions* of people living in extreme poverty (India).  
Yet none of them has turned into a Mad Max anarchic wasteland.  By and large, most every person just wants to live a safe &amp; peaceful life with a full belly.  There are so many stages of Recession &amp; Depression before it ever hits the point of murdering your neighbor in cold blood for a tomato.  
That being said, the most likely scenario IMHO, is a period more similar to the Depression.  Our unthinkable $21T debt will eventually be defaulted, probably after another major disaster destroys $2T of Florida coastline that FEMA can't cover.  
The exchange rate of the USD takes a plummet, and the costs of every imported item (&amp; the products produced from them) increase in price.  Especially oil, and everything that depends on it.  Meanwhile the values of our exports plummet, consumer spending halts, businesses begin to close up.  Unemployment skyrockets, and those who are lucky enough to keep jobs will certainly not be expecting a raise to cover the increased cost of living expenses.  And as tax revenues are decimated, social relief programs struggle to cover the growing number of poor.
This is the point in time where you liquidate your gold, silver, bitcoin, or any non-USD valuables into whatever currency on Earth is still stable.  And you get on a plane to that country and leave the rest behind.
When it comes to refugees, there are the ones that show up hungry &amp; penniless, and then there are the ones that show up with a chest full of silver &amp; local currency.  I plan to be the latter.
The economy back home will slowly recover as society adapts to a lifestyle less dependent on oil &amp; cheap imports, and more dependent on local agriculture &amp; sustainability.  Other countries see the fantastic labor rates they can get by outsourcing labor to the US, and slowly, very slowly, the money comes back.

In truth the answer is nobody knows.  “Collapse” comes in all sorts of flavors.  Although it’s possible, it’s unlikely to be a rapid crisis.  Instead we will get a slowly weakening dollar which leads to inflation, unemployment, and a weak dollar.  It will make imports more costly and we might have to give up two day amazon prime shipping, but the country produces enough food and energy within itself to provide for the people without foreign trade.  Hyperinflation will fuck people’s retirements but there’s no requirement that we will need to kill each other.

I perform digital forensics semi-regularly and can confirm these tools absolutely exist ([FTK]( is the 'Adobe Creative Suite' of its field).  They work rather well, especially on NTFS drives, which are Windows standard.
Reading data from newer HDD's works just as well.  You simply hook it up to a read-only SATA cable and load it in.  Like you said, deleting data without overwrite leaves it on there.  All of the data on a hard drive is stored in fragments throughout, and the Master File Table (MFT) is the index that keeps a record of which blocks contain what data.  When you delete a file, all your PC does is tells the MFT that those blocks can be considered free space again.  They may or may not get overwritten by random chance at some point in the future.
Reading the HDD bit-by-bit is just as easy on modern drives as it is on older ones, except for time required.  It can take hours to fully read and scan a 1TB drive.  And you can read every block and usually go through it with a hex reader.  The toolkits like FTK will do their damn best to assemble an entire windows explorer folder tree of the drive, pulling together fragmented data when possible.
The really scary tools out of mythos are the ones that can detect data even after an overwrite.  It has been tested and shown that with intense &amp; sensitive magnetic traces you can discover whether a bit was a 1 or a 0 before its current state.  But this is not practical among private use.

And security.  How else could you anonymously and trustlessly send someone that much money?  If you want it off the grid, you either have to be a government, or else you’re creating enigmatic shell companies or something.  Beyond that, if you’re Pablo Escobar, maybe you have to board a flight with a briefcase full of $190M in cash.  Good luck with that!
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:02:54
Right but my point was there is a cutoff limit to using cash.  You can't feasibly use cash for $190M on short notice.  
Where could you even come up with that much cash?  Certainly you couldn't just withdraw it from ATMs or the bank teller - and besides, that would leave a paper trail, setting off alerts for the feds.
So already we have to assume that you have this pre-existing cash stockpile sitting in a storage unit like Walter White.  That could have taken decades to accumulate discretely there.  
Now we've gotta find a way to ship it halfway around the world.  Certainly you can't just UPS it.  You'll have to deliver it by a private plane most likely, and hope that the customs &amp; border protection people somehow don't find it as soon as you land.
And you'll have to do this *yourself*, because you can't just hand some cronie $190M in off-the-grid bills and put him on a 22hr flight and send it away.  You'll never see your money again.
There is always a legal option, you could just conduct the transfers through various banks, and cooperate with the federal agents that ask you what you're up to.  But you'll pay hefty fees &amp; besides, they may not allow that much money to leave the country.  Particularly if your excuses are illegitimate.
I could come up with a dozen more reasons why cash is a terrible option for transferring $190M across the globe.  Cash is superior to BTC for every day purchases and common transactions.  BTC is far superior when transferring large sums.

Namecoin is the biggest casualty imho.  Such huge potential.  It was not designed to be a currency, but rather a blockchain alternative to our current DNS system.  (Yes redundant)
Currently ICANN -a pseudo-private public entity, based in the USA- controls how global internet domains are handed out, and licenses them through their registrars.  Namecoin could replace domain registrations for far cheaper, and provide them securely to the world.  
Currently the major DNS servers like your ISP or Google could potentially act maliciously and edit any DNS records to have domain names point to wherever they’d like.  Or seize them.  
Namecoin could have prevented this, and also useful for providing user friendly domain names to .onion links. 
Ultimately their development team was lacking, the user startup instructions to browse .bit domains requires a full node and DNS configurations, and they didn’t have a solution to the immediate squatting problem that arose.  Tragic because it is really a blockchain solution that could and should see global adoption.

please go into more detail.  gold is king as a store of value.  what you are effectively saying is that within 3-5 years there will be more humans on earth interested in buying bitcoin than there are buyers for gold.  that is a tall, tall, tall prediction.
Gold has historically been safe during economic recessions and depressions.  Gold is not an investment, it is as a hedge against disaster.  The relative lack of volatility is what makes it so well-suited for this.
If the US dollar begins to weaken or we hit Great Depression 2.0, I rest comfortably knowing that hundreds of millions of people will be clamoring to trade their USD for my gold &amp; silver.  I want it to be stable in value in my safe until that day.  I guarantee there were plenty of clever Venezuelans that owned precious metals before the Bolivar collapsed.  They were probably able to sell it and start a new life in a different country.  
I just don't see bitcoin mania replacing the thousands of years it took for gold &amp; silver to permeate every country and culture into being considered the literal 'gold standard' for something that will likely always be valuable, at least for my lifetime.

I bought about 100 btc when it was around $2-3
I sold it at around $9 and thought I was a fuckin slick rick, haha.  In my defense, at the time, it was total fucking mania.  Really no different than buying $1k and selling $5k.
Anyway, the price continued to climb to $1200, and I watched from the bleachers,
It tumbled, tumbled, tumbled, and I was glad not to be a part of it, because I was a total chicken little - 'The sky is falling!' - at every price $20+.  It was cathartic in some way being vindicated, even though the price was settled WAY higher than I had bought.
My brother had bought me 1 btc at $90 as an xmas gift that year.  I felt SUPER bad about it and tried to talk him out.  "You're wasting your money.... but thank you so much anyway..."  It was a generous gift, but I knew deep down he was way overpaying.
Anyway I held that btc and sold it on gyft to buy a gamestop gift card and bought an xbox one at launch, with change leftover.  I was happy for that.
Idk where I was going with this but that was basically my story.  Did it feel different?  Not a bit.  Think in terms of percentages, and it was basically the exact same.  People tell me I am insane for having sold at $9, but they are incapable of relating it back to real terms, the equivalent of having bought at $4k and selling at $18k.  
The USD-BTC raw quantities make no matter in this regard, because even back in those days, people were investing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars into it.  People pretend bitcoin mania did not hit until 2017 but it was very very real in 2013.  
Anyway, yeah, it's just about all the same, and it hurts just as much.
As a side note, in the past couple years I invested about $12000 into Ignite Restaurant Group (IRG), and lost every penny.  I've since learned a very costly lesson about cutting losses short and not being emotional.  Like every gambler eventually says, "What I wouldn't do to be down *just* 50% again..."

I wish I could type with a polite tone of voice, but I cannot.  So all I can say, in a non-argumentative way... were you actually there?  Because I was sitting in the freenode IRC every day, and on the bitcoin forums, and even on this subreddit, and it felt very much every bit as real.  Regular people invested $20,000 then, and they invested $20,000 now.  It makes no difference how many btc it bought.  There was still a lot of money at play.
It very well may feel different if you were at a different time financially in your life.  If you were only 19 playing around with $500, then it is child's play.  And 6 years later, it can feel like the real deal at magnitudes larger.  But it is just perspective.
That is simply my take on it, I'm not downvoting or arguing, like I said I wish I could say this with a polite tone, I don't want to come off wrong.  But there were just so many people invested then.  Even a $1000 bitcoin required a huge market cap back then.

There’s bias at play here.  As you age near retirement, it becomes more important to diversify in more low-risk assets.  Young people are plenty interested in gold, but they have less wealth and it is more sensible to put your investments into a growth account when younger. 
I agree BTC beats gold on a 5 year return but things get a lot more hazy on a 50 year outlook.  I have a lot of confidence that gold will have more value over a long enough timeline. Crypto is here to stay but it may not be BTC in particular.

The problem is that the increased prices won’t go away.  And that’s fine, I guess.  You’re right, retailers have raised prices by 4% to cover for credit card fees, but if we were to switch to better payment options, it’s really unlikely prices would drop again.  Especially since it will be a slow transition.

The you need a lesson in how the current ACH system works.  It's shit for every party involved, not just consumers, banks hate it too, but its a necessary evil.  
You know, the ACH system that makes all of your checks &amp; account transfers take 4 business days, and they don't transfer on weekends or Martin Luther King Day?  It's the only way for banks to have risk-free transfers between institutions.  It relies on a third party clearing house to settle up all of the payments before distributing them to the recipients.
Using blockchain to instantly confirm &amp; send transactions would be a godsend to them.  ACH costs big fees to the banks.  They could transfer huge chunks of money at relatively smaller fees, 24/7/365.  Banks would love to adopt some form of blockchain tech and they've been looking into it for years.  It may not be bitcoin in the end but I'm confident that it will be a blockchain.

I’m not trying to be difficult but it seems like there is an inherent flaw that whatever anonymous coin washer provides this service can skip town with your coins.

One possible explanation --
I keep most of my assets in my brokerage account, in US stocks and equities.  I hold BTC, as well as (physical) gold and silver, but it's a smaller portion of my portfolio.
This morning I noticed *many* stocks I was following got wayyy undervalued in the panic.  My father-in-law and I were both in a fritz watching the pre-markets, then the aftermath.  We both lost a lot of money at the opening bell.  But we saw a lot of opportunity.  Many securities we've had our eyes on, and ones we currently held, were getting beaten beyond belief.  We wanted to double down and buy more because it was clear that people were overselling.  
I needed more capital in my brokerage account fast.  So did he.  It was clear that so did everyone else -- I couldn't log into Scottrade from the resulting DDoS, he couldn't log in to Vanguard.  We couldn't make phone calls, the lines were so backed up they were dead.
Ultimately he was able to sell tons of bonds that he held -- which were holding up pretty well -- to free up some capital and buy in some more stocks.  I eventually got in and sold some different positions that I was still ahead in, and doubled down on some beaten securities.  
This was all only 3 hours ago, and since then, the markets recovered and I made 18% (on NASDAQ:IRG, if you're interested).  I did, however, keep my BTC thru all of this.
**Anyways, tl;dr - One possible cause could be that investors, in a panic to get liquid capital for re-investments at low prices, sold their BTC.**
but that's just an idea and it's tough to say for sure why markets behave the way they do.

The answer for *who* for literally all businesses is “entrepreneurial background”.  You hire your technicians to develop the technical side, you hire attorneys to handle the legal components, you hire support staff and administrators for the externalities, and you hire managers to handle your hiring.  
The business model is the same for most banks - commissions on each trade, primarily.  Investment vehicles based on deposits for others.  Managed services and advisory fees, if you go the route of mutual fund or brokerage.

A large portion of the bitcoin farms have moved to Iceland.  
Iceland has the cheapest &amp; cleanest electricity on earth.  100% of their power comes from geothermal activity; they simply drill a bore hole about 2 km down into their volcanic crust, pump in sea water, boil it, power some steam turbines, and the only outputs are purified de-salinated freshwater, electricity, and salt.  
The electricity is so damn cheap it's near free.  80% of the country's electric output goes to aluminum smelting, it's one of their major industries.  Other countries will mine &amp; import aluminium powder, smelt it in Iceland (a very energy intensive process), and then ship the aluminum products back out.
There are many enormous bitcoin farms operating there, where electricity is extremely cheap, and ambient air temps can help with cooling, with zero negative environmental impact.

Semi-strong market theory says if the market knows the price will go up tomorrow, then the price goes up today.

that's a little disingenuous.  the Upbit hack is being investigated by New Zealand Police, with specialist staff from the force’s High Tech Crime Unit and the Canterbury Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB).
by all means you can get away with it, but it's silly to say "you'd have to be dumb to get caught".  you'd have to be very smart to successfully pull it off.  at a minimum, all of your procedures and policies will be audited for wrongdoing, and *someone* will be held liable for those.  they will absolutely find out *how* the funds got stolen.  and once that person gets thrown under the bus and is facing their own charges, they very well might sing.  
people are unpredictable.  some developer was promised a handsome jackpot for letting the breach happen, but soon finds themselves at the shit end of an investigation &amp; blamed by the company they are covering for.  they find themselves &amp; their family &amp; friends under severe scrutiny while they sort out very scary consequences.  they have no way of secretly cashing in on their stolen funds, all accounts are monitored for suspicious payments.
that's when they snitch.
it would be very difficult for any insider to reclaim their $50 million that was stolen.  you'd have to be pretty dumb to try.

exactly.  for precisely the same reason, the USD is not perfectly fungible either.
Obviously it's much more fungible than, say, bartering with livestock.  But it is not 100%.
e.g.,:  There are serial numbers on the notes, and some of the serial numbers in circulation are tagged as having been robbed from a bank.  This makes a very *mild* argument that freshly minted notes direct from the Treasury are more desirable than circulating notes.  therefore not fungible.
coins would have a better argument for fungibility since they aren't designated with serial numbers, but they come with their own issues of rarities and grades that can affect value too.
I'd argue that bitcoin is less fungible than cash to a certain extent, since blockchain analysis can happen in realtime and passively, as opposed to checking serial numbers on banknotes

No way, the primary use is for underground markets to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to anywhere on earth with anonymity.
I find it funny that bitcoin found its early niche in darknet markets and illegal activity for buying drugs.
It has now grown into the *real* illegal activity, which is moving stupid amounts of money around the world.
Bitcoin will never be used to buy a cup of coffee, as we all like to dream.  It will be used every time you hear in the news that Paul Manafort had over $212M hiding in Russia; it will be used every time a corporation wants to move their overseas revenues back home domestically without paying 30% in taxes.  It would have been an ideal choice during the Nixon era programs to help receive money from the Saudis in secret in exchange for protection, had bitcoin existed then, and these types of programs are still happening around the world.
There are also very legitimate uses, happily operating within Uncle Sam's vision; Wall St loves bitcoin.  Particularly the commodities exchanges are really growing into it.  Even the banks, you'd think they'd shun bitcoin, on the contrary they have many analysts publicly pouring praise for it.  They are regularly brokering deals with huge amounts of money and paying big % transaction fees on them.  Bitcoin fees are cheap.
Think about it; how else could you possibly send someone $100,000,000 in secret to anywhere on earth within 10 minutes, secure without fraud or theft during transit?  Have a guy board a plane with a briefcase full of money?  Wire it through different banks on the books?  Exchange your country's currency for theirs?
Bitcoin's primary use is just getting started, and in order to support this new niche, it needs to grow even further.

Except allow their exchanges to profit considerably from the flux of people migrating.  
The coins would be lost to the suckers who trusted Coinbase to protect them, but I don't see the leap to "Bitcoin would be over".  There's so many variables.
The massive move toward censorship and outright theft by the government would probably raise more alarms than ever.  I can only imagine the compelling case it would make for people to want to own BTC themselves.  It's a wake up call for everyone globally that your money is no longer safe unless you hold it.

Here is the entire article without paywall:
Coinbase is facing a new lawsuit alleging that its employees and other insiders reaped huge gains by trading on nonpublic information that the cryptocurrency exchange planned to support transactions in a Bitcoin offshoot called Bitcoin Cash.
The [**class action suit**]( filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, appears to be the first filed in a federal court alleging insider trading\-like claims over Coinbase’s announcement that it would handle transactions in Bitcoin Cash last December.
According to the complaint, insiders drove up the price of Bitcoin Cash, also called BCH, by executing buy and sell orders moments after the move by Coinbase—one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.
The activity caused the value of the cryptocurrency to spike by 200 percent in the minutes after trading opened on Dec. 19, the complaint adds. That led Coinbase to temporarily freeze trading, and remaining Bitcoin Cash purchasers were forced to pay “artificially inflated prices that had been manipulated well beyond the fair market value of BCH at that time,” it alleges.
The complaint also says that, while Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly acknowledged suspicions of insider trading and [**pledged to undertake an internal investigation**]( “to date, neither Armstrong nor the company has disclosed the result of its purported investigation.”
The complaint was filed by Green &amp; Noblin in Larkspur, California, and by The Grant Law Firm in New York. The named plaintiff, Jeffrey Berk, is an Arizona resident who alleges that his buy order for BCH was executed at roughly double the price as when he submitted it.
Coinbase did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about the lawsuit.
Although the complaint makes insider trading\-like allegations, it cites California’s Unfair Competition Law and common law negligence as causes of action—likely due to the fact that BCH is not currently regulated as a security. The Commodities Futures Trading Corp. has said that Bitcoin is a commodity.
BCH was created last year by what is known as a “hard fork” of the Bitcoin blockchain—the creation of a variant of the original software. According to the complaint, Coinbase initially suggested it would not handle transactions in BCH. The company later said it would begin supporting some transactions in BCH in January 2018 but then abruptly changed course by opening trading on Dec. 19, the complaint alleges.
In a [**subsequent blog post**]( a senior Coinbase manager wrote that employees were notified about a month ahead of time that support for trading in BCH was coming. Those employees “were explicitly prohibited from buying and selling BCH,” he added. “All employees were also barred from sharing this information with anyone outside of Coinbase.”

1. Price dips
2. Miners exit
3. Difficulty adjusts downward
4. Mining becomes more profitable
5. More miners join back in
6. Difficulty re-adjusts upward
7. Price continues to fluctuate independently from number of miners
conclusion: there's always exactly as many miners in the market as there needs to be
newbies forget that we survived for many years with prices in sub $100, sub $1000 ranges, where there was hundreds of millions of dollars in the network.  And the network was more than strong enough to resist.  We've grown several orders of magnitude since then.  
Also don't forget that the worst thing someone can do in a 51% attack is simply double-spend some coins they already have.  It can be caught and rectified too.  They can't steal your coins, but it would be hazardous to accept them in a time when a 51% attack is likely.

But I’ll admit this time feels different.  I sold at $11k and feel good about it.  I’ve held for years and am happy enough with the big profits.  If we start to dip below $8k... it will be a long long road to getting back to the hype levels we had 2 months ago.

I have a degree in economics, finance, and MIS.  My general opinion on the matter for the past 7 years has been that blockchain is absolutely the future foundation for a lot of our technology.  Bitcoin itself as the de facto token may or may not be a part of it.  I think we may absolutely see banks start using a blockchain tech for transferring deposits and payments, but I’ll bet they develop their own US govt blockchain to do it.

Traders know the value of a stop loss order.  Sometimes you need to cut losses, even when it’s painful.  
I learned that lesson the hard way, two years ago when a stock I was holding kept crashing.  I figured after about 50% loss, I was in it for the long run.  Couldn’t bring myself to actually sell, in the off chance it recovered (it seemed possible).  And when it completely hit zero, I kind of wish I’d have just stayed at a 50% loss.  Lesson learned.  That was emotional investing.
If your current BTC holdings are still worth thousands at this moment, consider avoiding the same mistake I did.  waiting a few years might not recover the loss.  If we dip sub $1k, you might be wishing you sold at $5000.

the network is currently at 47,295,462 THash/s.  [(source)](
51% = 24,120,685 THash/s, or 24,121 PHash/s
Bitmain/Antpool is the largest mining network in the world, most poised to take over in a 51% attack.  Bitmain officially owns and controls at least two large mining pools: AntPool &amp; BTC.com.  They hypothetically could makes moves in unison.  This doesn’t necessarily mean that Bitmain, itself, controls all the hash power directed at its pools. Even if the Chinese mining giant owns the mining pools, it’s possible that most of the hash power attributed to these pools comes from individual hashers. 
* [Antpool hashrate]( 4962.22 PHash/s
* [BTC.com hashrate]( 6958 PHash/s
This gives them about 25% of the network hashing power with ~12 EHash/s.  If about half of the miners globally (who are NOT mining on either of these pools, specifically) drop out, then they could indeed do a 51% attack.
The true part is weighing in operating costs of electricity versus profitability.  If the price dips, miners will leave, but this increases profitability for everyone else, resulting in incentives to stay/join.
There's also a consideration that tx volume is very high during big price swings, often resulting in increased tx fees, which would factor into profitability decisions.  
Finally, many of these powerful mining operations were funded on mining contracts with debt &amp; obligations to uphold.  They may still be mining no matter what the price is.

Mining does not HAVE to increase.  The number of miners in operation at this moment is enough to support any volume.  The network barely needed a few THash/s collectively, like we had in 2012.  The rest is just artificial difficulty scaling because we can’t stop people from becoming miners.  But it isn’t necessary.

I don't speak for /[u/Chiefesoteric](/user/Chiefesoteric), but I think he was saying that bitcoin cannot 'go to zero'.  It's nigh impossible for every single miner &amp; node to quit within our lifetimes.  Someone, somewhere, will still be running a mining node for the next 100\+ years.  Probably a lot of someones, in fact!
I can't foresee bitcoin ever dipping into single digits ever again.  There will always be many enthusiasts who would happily acquire a handful of BTC for the price of a sandwich, just as a novelty.
Considering that we still have hundreds of thousands of users still clinging onto IRC channels and other similar old tech, I cannot feasibly see a way for bitcoin to be completely wiped out.
Because bitcoin is not a company, it cannot go bankrupt or have bad management or issue a controversial statement or have a bad fiscal year.  It is eternal and impartial to the world around it, and evolves on a global standard.  Therefore I think it had potential to *always* remain cyclical, for enthusiasts to get back on board, and re\-boost its popularity.  Even if there is a spectacular crash, that doesn't make it useless.  Slowly, people will return to using it, and just say they won't make the same investing mistakes again.  Repeat ad infinatum.

...every single day in this subreddit, man.  Wake up.  Tens of thousands of people bought in at $13k - $19k.  Billions of dollars invested at those price levels.  Look at the downvoted comments in most threads.
I made a lot of money last year and am personally glad, at this moment, to have sold at $15k in exchange for a bunch of gold bullion.  The person I sold to is probably one of those “nonexistent” people who has a bit of regret for buying it.
Anyways, I’m not bearish, I’ll probably buy back in some day, but for now I’m happy to have sold when I did.

I can issue a sell command and liquidate all of it in an instant at the current market price.  The funds will probably sit "locked and pending" for a day or two while the bank transfer goes through, but the sale price is still locked regardless. 
This is only on values up to $10k with my current account settings. I imagine if you're trying to liquidate $400k you might have to plan ahead a little more carefully. It's certainly possible but you probably need to contact someone at the exchange and bank to help you facilitate it. 
That being said, the ultimate dream is that one day the entire sub-economy that accepts Bitcoin has grown to the point that converting back to USD isn't necessary, and we operate with two currencies.

Care to explain how that is different than producing physical currencies?
If the US mints a quarter in 1965, and that quarter gets ‘spent’ tens of thousands of times as part of transactions across 50 years, does that mean the quarter was useless?  
I can see why it would seem like the quarter was just a zero sum to anyone who earned and then spent it, but it served highly useful utility and was worth its cost of production.

They *do* have an algorithm for this.  If you submit any ad that includes a trademarked name, then it is stuck pending a manual review until it is approved. 
Perhaps bitaddress just hasn't been added to the list of trademarked names yet. As someone else said, contacting them would sort this out.

I’ve done it with bitcoin core, but no, it wasn’t easy.  You have to restart the wallet with a -zaptxes command to allow yourself to double spend, and if you’re not quick about it, it will find the old tx in the mempool and you need to restart.  You also need to ensure you are spending the same exact coins with coin control features.  It’s almost just worth it to wait 2 months like OP. 
It would be great for core to include a simple option for right clicking a tx and requesting a re-send with higher fee.

Bitcoin is designed to be used as a currency. Period. 
It does not matter what the exchange rate is.  And that’s not it’s purpose.  It is a currency, and it is designed to replace those quarters. 
What we are striving for is a system in which every aspect of what a quarter can do, a bitcoin can do. 
“Investors” are a nuisance to bitcoin.  They help get exposure, and their losses will deal a critical blow to publicity.  But that isn’t the end game. 


I think we are on the same page, but arguing different aspects of the same issue.  Bitcoin is meant to be used as a currency.  The USD-BTC exchange rate does not need be important if we could only get a stable valuation.  I don’t care if 1 BTC is $1 or $1,000,000.  If it can just stay calm then we could actually develop a sub-economy on it. 
(And as a side note, yes, people invest in physical currencies by the billions; the forex market is very alive and well)

Here are the actual statistics regarding this topic.
599 fiat currencies have been tried throughout mankind's known history, that have failed.  The ones that haven't failed are of course still in use today, and there are about 24 or so.
Of the 599 failed paper currencies, researchers found:
-- 30 percent, or 184, ended with monetary unions, dissolution or other reforms, like the creation of the euro in 1999;
-- 15 percent, or 94, ended via acts of independence (such as former colonial states gaining their independence and renaming or issuing new currency);
-- 27 percent, or 156, were devastated by hyper-inflation caused by over-issuance of paper money by governments and central banks (sound familiar?); and
-- 28 percent, or 165, were destroyed by war -- deemed invalid through military occupation and/or liberation (think Confederate dollars).
And there is this: Most paper "fiat" currencies last 38-39 years -- the U.S. went off the gold standard completely in 1971, or about 43 years ago.

Yes, something that was driven down our throats in finance school was about the semi-strong market theory.  *“If people know the price will go up tomorrow, then the price will go up today.”* That was a mantra that was constantly repeated. 
That’s the reason we saw crypto price soar already.  People were basically betting that crypto had already succeeded and priced it accordingly. 
Eventually a considerable amount of doubt has been cast and so the price got balanced out considerably.  Even $2k bitcoin is still a pretty strong market cap bet that it will be moderately successful for commerce.  Not full economy scale, but many times larger than what we are seeing now. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:03:42
The less miners there are, the more profitable it is.  The more miners there are, the less profitable it is.  This is because we are sharing block rewards among all miners in a pool.
Ultimately many of them will exit, but only down to a certain sweet spot where the others are incentivized to stay.  After all, if too many exit, then suddenly there's money to be had by joining back in.
Unfortunately, I think the ones that stick it out through the end will be centralized in areas with cheap electricity &amp; no govt regulation, and a lot of the most powerful hardware and largest mining operations.  Centralization is bad for the network integrity, but it won't fall apart.

I’m not trying to be condescending. I’m trying to change the views of so many people who think gold is absolutely worthless beyond “shiny rock”.  As far as having properties ideal for a currency, the precious metals family of elements has been unparalleled for millennia.  (Until bitcoin, that is.)
Immutable, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, intrinsic value. 
That makes it valuable. Gold is well-suited to the task of being a currency for more reasons than “ooh shiny” as you originally claimed. 
Also, it’s not a shitty flaky rock.  It is literally not one of those three things.  It is a malleable and ductile metal.

you're completely correct, BUT, you can make economic disincentives so that it never happens.  Monero just recently went through this as it was discovered that bitman ASICs had been built for Monero.  An updated build moved the blockchain and rendered all of the ASIC hardware unusable.  ASICs have a payback period on investment, and it sends a pretty strong message that the community intends to change the chain every time you build a new one.
nonetheless, it is a game of cat and mouse.  but it's a game where the cat needs to pay a ton of R&amp;D money to play.

Probably most? Mutual funds are a very simple concept and can be explained in one paragraph without a full background on cryptography. 
“Investing $5,000 is not really enough to buy a fully diversified portfolio and manage the different components full time.  So you can pool the funds together in our *mutual* fund with thousands of other investors, and we can take the collective millions of dollars and invest it with much more power in a broad selection of securities.  We skim 1-2% of the returns per year, and then proportionally distribute the remaining returns back to your account.”

When you sell Bitcoin on Coinbase it goes directly into your bank's checking account.  So yes it is easy. 
The problem (ADVANTAGE) of Bitcoin is there is no regulation. The stock market has trading hours, the SEC, and a killswitch that shuts down markets in periods of extreme collapse.  Bitcoin could hypothetically plummet in value within seconds if everybody panic sold.  Coinbase doesn't allow for limit orders.  So yeah you could be screwed there. 
But if you're just looking at gambling with $100? You will probably be fine. 
It will take you up to a week to get verified, and I am sure their service team is swamped with requests right now.  So by the time you buy, the price will be totally different

I've been using Bitcoin since 2011 and lost about $90 of coins in Gox.  I was notified during the class action suit and placed my proper filing claims and was reimbursed.  So I have past experience to say that if the exchange totally robs my coins, outright steals them, I will most likely be reimbursed.  Being based on US soil makes me trust Coinbase much more than Gox as well. 
I have a Bitcoin-qt client running on my computer and could, and historically have, store it there.  One time my hard drive got corrupted and I was lucky to have made regular backups.  But it made me realize that I am much more of a risk than I previously realized. 
Anyway I am currently keeping them on Coinbase because I am doing so much buying and selling that I want it to be readily liquid.

Maybe the US dollar is relatively stable in your lifetime (except for 2008?), but it will not always be.  There's a rule in financial markets that if people know *definitively* that the price will go up tomorrow, then the price will go up today.  
As long as the following statements are true:
* there will always be a demand for one person to transfer currency to another person anonymously
* countries somewhere on earth face economic collapse and the residents of those countries start looking to convert their wealth into something else
* e-commerce continues to grow to new record highs every year but businesses want to minimize the transaction fees that credit card companies collect on this
As long as statements like these continue to be true, there will always be a demand for Bitcoin, or something exactly like it.  We've just been waiting for that tipping point when it gets widespread adoption.  It's extremely unlikely that any time in the near future you will be paid in Bitcoin, or pay your mortgage with it.  But go look at the national debt clock right now, and tell me how confident you are that we can just ignore it forever... Or watch what happens to the value of a dollar during the next stock market crash or housing market bubble....

Download the Bitcoin-qt client for windows. 
Install. 
Wait for the entire blockchain to download and catch up. Expect this to take up to a week+ (yes really). 
In the meantime buy Bitcoin from some exchange. 
Once Bitcoin-qt is caught up, generate a receiving address, send coins to yourself from the exchange. 
Wait for transaction to verify. 
Make a backup of wallet.dat (you can copy the file right out of %appdata%)
Store it somewhere forever. 
You can restore the wallet at any time on any computer by overwriting the wallet.dat file on that PC's app data folder.

It's going to be much harder to break now.  Due to psychological factors of the markets.  There are a lot of people who bought at $2700+ and then immediately saw the crash.  And as the selloff was happening, of course, there were many people who saw their opportunity and were thus buying, all the way down.
During a dip like this, everyone who bought in at a price above the current $2440 is worried, and many of them are thinking "Fuck this.  As soon as it gets back to (price I bought at), I'm out."  
So this makes a much stronger barrier now to get back across $2800.  But once it starts getting close, it will surge through more powerfully.  An ATH means you have fully left the "I just need to make my money back" crowd in the dust and everyone is currently winning.

That's called 'arbitrage', a financial term used when the same security is priced differently in two different markets.  Arbitrage opportunities occur every time a stock is sold or currency is exchanged; however, computers with near-zero latency ping execute trades to capitalize on them and close the gap.
Bitcoin is different.  Hypothetically you could buy bitcoin on one exchange, send it to another, and sell it off at a profit.  But the time for transactions is not instant, and the exchange would require confirmations before you can sell the block.  From the time you place your first buy order, transfer, and then the sell order is confirmed, it could be several hours, and the price can be very different then.  Arbitrage is a lot harder with bitcoin.
Surprisingly, there are still a lot of opportunities available.  Buying in USD, selling in CND or GBP or EUR, converting those currencies, presents a good chance to make guaranteed arbitrage dollars.  But you need to find a way to make much faster transaction times.

Let's assume the price is still $2500 flat, to make maths easy. 
If you buy $100 of BTC, then you own .04 BTC.  Congrats!
If the price increases to $3000 and you sell your .04 BTC, you own $120.  That's a return of 20%.  Cool beans, that's very respectable!
The percentage based returns are the exact same no matter what quantity you bought.  
So, if you had initially bought not $100, but $100,000! That would be 40 BTC! And you would be selling for $120,000 if the price increased to $3,000.  That's still a return of 20%. 
Sure in raw value, one is worth a lot more, but whether you are investing $1 or $1,000 your returns would be the same. 
Now a lot of exchanges may have a fixed purchase fee (commission), for example $2 + 1%.  In this case, it throws off your % returns slightly.  Buying and selling only $10 is not worth it because you're hoping for 25% price swings just to cover costs at all. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:51:57
If you're truly okay with losing the $100, then you don't have much to lose.  But maybe you hold it for a couple years and find you had a lot to gain. 
$100 is such low risk anyway... the price is currently $2600.  Even if the bubble is a sudden HUGE drop, goes down to $1000, I mean you'll still have like $40-$50 left.  Not exactly a major risk.  Everyone is so caught up in "buy the dip" right now that I think it will be hard for the price to really fall below $1k.  A lot of people will be waiting to force it back up.

coinbase has an instant exchange address, in accounts &gt; USD Wallet &gt; Instant exchange.  If you send btc to this address it will instantly convert it to USD based on coinbase rates and put it back in your account.  Personally I plan to keep holding at least through mid-August, probably far longer, but I find that address is the fastest way to get coins to cash.
Alternatively I am a fan of the website JM Bullion if you'd like to buy physical gold, silver, or platinum.  They accept bitcoin and charge a rate very close to spot (no cc fees).  So I have been buying up gold &amp; silver occasionally with my bitcoin as price rises.  This might be a good idea if you're selling a very large amount and want to try to obfuscate it rather than use coinbase, who is tied heavily to your identity and potentially the IRS.

If you're in the US, coinbase.  Be prepared for it to take you several days to get verified though.  You need to scan copies of licenses, proof of ID, verify a bank account, etc. 
It's probably for the best. I know Bitcoin has a lot of anonymous and illegal uses so you may not want it connected to you.  Some exchanges require less validation; there may even be someone selling cash for Bitcoin on Craigslist in your city.  But those come with risks and lack of protection from Uncle Sam if you lose your wallet. Coinbase is responsible for your wallet, although if their system crashes while the price is crashing, that would be a problem.

A degree in macroeconomics would be a good start.  The entire system you're looking at is called Keynesian Economics and I recommend you read the Wikipedia article about it.

Where's dogecoin
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:22:42


Namecoin.  Namecoin, namecoin, namecoin.  The blockchain (not currency) that has been around for several years now and it can't get any exposure to save its life.
Namecoin is a decentralized, P2P blockchain solution to the current internet DNS system.
Brief overview of why it's fucking important (to me).  As we all know, websites (servers) have IP addresses.  These are difficult for humans to remember.  So we have domain names.  Much easier to tell people to visit Microsoft.com rather than 131.107.0.89.  
**Who controls the domain names?**
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers -- ICANN. A private, US-based corporation that got market timing perfectly and invented the domain name system.  Not everyone can just register a domain name.  You need to go through a registrar, like GoDaddy or NetworkSolutions (or 1000 others).
What does it take to become a registrar?  It can exceed $180,000 per year through application fees and capital requirements.  $10,000+ in fees are payable directly to ICANN.
ICANN controls all the policies (not laws, just their own policies) governing who can register what domain names and why.  For example, the rights to owning a .edu or a .gov or a .mil address are determined by ICANN.
Domain names are a product that has nearly zero marginal cost to produce.  The big registrars like GoDaddy pay their $10k fee every year, and then they hope to sell 4k domain names at $10 a pop.  Each additional domain name costs nothing to produce.
ICANN has a tremendous amount of power.  They don't do a whole lot.  Just ensure that regulations continue to behave properly toward them.  They control the ledger of what domain names are registered to whom.  All DNS servers need to resolve against ICANN's database in order to resolve every domain name entry.
Other countries (Europe in particular) has expressed disconcern that this private US corporation gets to control how the modern internet behaves.
This is what Namecoin solves.  Namecoin is a blockchain ledger that associates .bit domains with IP addresses and other DNS records.  It is **not** a currency.  (It could potentially be used as one but it is poorly suited due to transaction limits and block sizes.  But you can still buy/sell/send namecoins the same as btc if you desire.)
Namecoin is mined simultaneously with bitcoin.  The same miners that are mining bitcoin are currently producing namecoin with a negligible increase in processing costs.
Currently, in order to browse or resolve .bit domains, your DNS server needs to be running a node of namecoin.  Most commonly, people have their DNS servers set to their ISP's.  Google runs some good free DNS servers too.  But neither of these have expressed any interest in operating a namecoin node yet.  It just hasn't gotten much exposure despite lack of trying.
Tor websites- .onion domains- suffer from being difficult character strings that are difficult to remember.  Tor websites do not want to register their personal info with ICANN for obvious reasons.  They could use .bit domains to solve this.
When you register a website with namecoin, a fraction of that namecoin is permanently destroyed, so it is an inflationary currency too.  21 million namecoins will be mined, on the same pace as btc.
Namecoin, at current prices, would enable someone to register a .bit domain name for about $0.02 per year.  Totally private, decentralized, away from the control of a secretive US entity that has too much authority.
I recommend every business buys and registers their namecoin .bit domain, just to reserve it.  Squatting is a bit of a problem, but the bigger problem that first needs to be overcome is getting someone like Google to incorporate a namecoin node into their own open DNS servers, which would bring support to millions of people without them evening realizing it.
Namecoin currently floats around $2 USD per NMC.  At one point, it was over $6.  And if the day comes where Google decides to add support to this, or foreign countries' ISPs, then it will suddenly become big news.  Hell, if coinbase even started adding a market for buying &amp; selling NMC, the price would probably surge once it gets more exposure.  Setting aside $200 to buy yourself 100 NMC could pay off very big in the future.  Or it could lose $200.  Your risk, not mine.
But namecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies out there that *screams* at the huge potential it has. 
Just my two cents.  (Or, my 1 .bit domain)

No.  It's literally a pump and dump scheme.
And yes, I have been here for many years, I know full well all of the assholes that always say that about bitcoin.  But I have carefully pored through Ethereum's website.  It talks about Ether's use in paying the network for transactions.  *What kind of transcations?*  What companies are currently using it?  In what world is it possibly cheaper to pay $200 per ETH to have a network of computers run your computations rather than just having them run themselves?  
Can someone point me to a real-world business, company, or application that is relying on Ether?  Exactly how many xyz does one Ether buy me in processing power?  Is it hashing power?  Can I host a service like Spotify using Ether?  Can I host a simple Wordpress website on Ether, complete with MySQL &amp; PHP?  At best, I can barely imagine hosting a simple service like *Pastebin* on Ether, let alone something like reddit. At current prices, would it even be cheaper to do so?  
I'm not convinced Ether is worth anything.  And if it is, then its main competition is massive &amp; inexpensive server farms like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Console, that let you easily scale up &amp; roll out virtual machines and use Google's machine learning tech and all sorts of awesome tools.  All for a few dollars per month, with 24/7 support in every language.
Ether's documentation is vague, the website fails to list specifics on how I can actually *spend* and use it.  Its cause is noble; Ethereum's creators certainly did not intend for it to be a pump and dump, but the market has the price overinflated by about $200 right now.  Its actual practical world usage is competing against Amazon &amp; Google which charge pennies for a much better network than Ether currently offers.

Back in the days of $2-$3, I used to enter bitcoin raffles frequently where you could pay 1 BTC for a 1:100 chance to win 99 BTC... they used to be my lottery tickets, whenever I mined enough shares with my gpu running on my college dorm's electricity... my way of having my pc make me free money.  they were some simpler times.
of course, once the price started hitting $30, I sold everything and told everyone in the IRC channels how this was a ridiculously crazy price jump and was completely unsustainable.  
I shouldn't be mad because I made a grand or two on my coins, that's nothing to be ashamed of, but I do occasionally look back at my wallet's transaction log and reminisce about how I once had 200 BTC.

Just curious, have you ever downloaded or installed Bitcoin-qt before?  You'll be best off finding the getting started guide on their website. 
The file wallet.dat is the actual store of your bitcoins in a format that is readable by a Bitcoin-qt client.  On Windows, this file is stored by default in your AppData folder, but you can custom specify a different location.  AppData is normally a hidden folder found in your windows User directory. 
I always access it by using the run command (windows shortcut is to press the windows key + r) and then typing in %appdata% and it will open into AppData/Roaming.  You'll find your Bitcoin directory in there with wallet.dat inside

*So far*, no.  It is a growing concern that many global governments have somewhere on the radar, and without a doubt this recent price hike will bring it to the forefront.
Currently the IRS treats bitcoin as an asset and not a currency, and as such there are no taxes on it.
You will know that your taxes are due when your coin exchange starts submitting 1099-INT or 1099-DIV to the IRS (and to you).  So far the laws don't allow it.

it's because there are countless people who have severe FOMO and have been watching the price static at $2700, who have been praying for 3 weeks that there would be another price dip to buy in at.

False.  Monero is useful for far more than washing coins - just cut the middleman out altogether.  There's never a need to wash Monero because it is always fungible, untraceable, and impossible to determine the sender or the amount.  
Bitcoin has the infrastructure to be used as an actual currency to buy the proverbial cup of coffee.  And don't get me wrong, I still remain just as strong of a BTC as I always have been since 2011.  But until the coffee is priced as a fixed rate in BTC and not as a floating exchange to the USD, it will always be a process of converting to fiat.  Even with lightning networks this is a great inconvenience when compared with cash or cashback credit cards with airline miles.  BTC is supreme for moving LARGE amounts of money globally and that's where I believe it's niche will always be.
Monero already owns the darknet and will continue to.  It is unparalleled for use in private transactions.  People are using it for far more than speculation; it is actually going to become the defacto privacy currency.  This means that it can stay forever in the inconvenient realm of conversion to fiat.  Because the use case for Monero is for buying things that *cannot* be bought with cash or credit card.  To deny that this is a huge benefit that gives it some permanent sticking power is shortsighted.

I watched CPU mining die in favor of GPU mining, and then ASIC mining conquered the market.  Nowadays even ASIC mining is already falling to the wayside in favor of cloud mining (which is still ASIC, but massive scale).  
Very large datacenters are being built in places like Iceland, where the geothermal electricity is so unbelievably cheap it's nearly free, and the cold arctic air can help cool the overheating chips for free.
Go see what Gensis Mining is up to.  The mining game has already shifted power away from individual ASIC miners, and moved to the massive operations with thousands of integrated ASIC miners who can strategically share work without repeating nonces, have a definitive advantage over you in cost and custom development.
Don't get me wrong, I've been running solo-mining on my home server for 4.5 years in the offchance it wins me the lottery.  No, it has not.  It almost certainly never will.  But the only reason I keep it turned on is because it doesn't require continued added investment, since it is powered already on anyway.  Sinking additional money into mining at this point seems very fruitless unless you go really big, or create a new kind of chip.
**tldr** ask yourself this million dollar question:  if owning &amp; operating a bitcoin miner is more profitable than the upfront cost to buy one, *then why tf would BitMain ever sell theirs*?  It's estimated that the S9 costs between $300-$500 to produce.  Common sense would say that Bitmain should just produce and mine on their own, but instead, they sell the miners for $1200 to the public.  I suppose this could pay off long term if the price of bitcoin goes way up in the future, but in that case, you still might work out just as well as if you'd bought $1200 of BTC instead.

As a percentage of transaction total, it is *dirt* cheap.  $1.26 to send $400 is a cost of 0.3%.  You will not find any secure method on earth of transferring fiat for that rate, especially without foreign transaction fees.
If you are only sending $3, you can readily expect to pay $0.009 as a transaction fee.  
This is all assuming you run your own wallet and keep a copy of blockchain on your own client.  I can't speak for web services that charge their own fees on top of transaction fees.

You have to be patient and wait many days for it to update.  It will eventually catch up, and this is mandatory before you can retrieve those coins. 


If you download Bitcoin core onto a new computer, it will still take equally long to download the entire blockchain and catch up.  And once it does, it will be a blank wallet with a zero balance.  You can copy your wallet.dat file from the old computer and overwrite the wallet.dat on the new install, but it will still take quite a while to verify the new blockchain and still catch up. 
Sorry to say you are really at the mercy of just waiting for this.  I would advise you download and install an updated version of Bitcoin core on top of this however.  It won't affect your coins, but the newer clients can accept more simultaneous connections and also have nicer progress bars and estimates for how long is remaining.  
Patience is the name of the game; be happy that you stumbled upon $500!

It doesn't matter at all what other coins trade at.  They are all separate markets and share different purposes.  When you value any other security, such as a stock, you look at that company's market share and revenues and determine if the price matches the foreseeable performance in the future.  
It makes no sense to say Amazon is overpriced at $1000 a share just because other stocks like Ford don't even come close.
On this note, I will toss in that I think Ethereum is stupidly overpriced and is just being bid up by everyone else trying to get rich on a crypto.  Ethereum is designed for companies to buy processing power on the network for their apps and there is currently such a tiny market for this actual intended use, that the price is way too high.
I also believe that Bitcoin is currently high because it is now far larger in market capitalization than PayPal's total value, despite the fact that PayPal handles 15x as many transactions per minute and has complete adoption.  Bitcoin is worth more than the cumulative global supply of silver, which is a good traditional market for store of value.  Essentially, at $2500, the market has already placed strong faith that bitcoin will definitively replace both of these things, even though it has a long long way to go before it sees the same kind of popularity as PayPal or silver bullion.  But hey, if it does, then fuck yeah! Don't forget the price is also much higher because there aren't many ways to short sell bitcoin, so bulls have much more power to bid the price up, whereas bears can't really drive the price down.

tax brackets work based on incremental income.  i.e., only the income you make beyond $412,000 is actually taxed at the highest rate.  All of the 'first' dollars below that are taxed at their own bracket, it's not like you pay 39% cap gains taxes on the full sale.  just 39% off of whatever is in excess of $412,000.
in any case, if you're looking for a long term safe store of value, I highly respect your faith in bitcoin, but you should really diversify.  Like many people here I am a huge believer in the btc, but when you're dealing with over $500k +, it's very silly to put it all in one basket.  
Do yourself a favor and find a website that accepts bitcoin as a payment for bullion and buy $100k of gold and $100k of silver.  Keep the rest in bitcoin if you like.  Silver is a lot safer than fiat and has a market cap roughly equal to bitcoin currently if you need longterm store of value.  You won't get rich with 5,000% returns on silver but if you're looking to be safe during a hyperinflation government economic crisis, silver is excellent.  You can buy $100,000 of silver paid in bitcoin and not pay a single penny to Uncle Sam.
I'm not saying sell all, or exit the game, no no no not by any means, but for common sense sake you should really diversify if 99.99% of all your assets is being stored in something that has a 60% volatility swing in a month.

Currently it is just .bit domains, possibly it could be expanded to include other TLDs as long as they aren't already controlled by ICANN.  For example I don't think nmc could ever be used to register a .com; there would be a conflict if someone registers google.com using namecoin and points it to somewhere else.  It couldn't be adopted in that way.
But possibly namecoin could be expanded so that someone could register a .asjd domain that isn't in use by ICANN?  It can't in its current form but a UASF could remedy that.  
Like I said though the biggest challenge that nmc has faced for years has been adoption by pre-existing DNS giants.  It is hopeless to ask most users to download their own node and configure their network settings just to browse .bit domains.  But if it hits that tipping point where Verizon or Google adds in native support, then every company might be in a mad dash to register their .bit equivalent.  Maybe.
ICANN actually got some criticism for this when they expanded their TLDs by hundreds in recent years.  Adding on things like .xyz, .me, .games, .home, etc.  Major businesses were now effectively forced to register hundreds of new domains just to reserve their trademarks, and this was seen as a cash grab by some.  At this time, I would prefer if namecoin avoids any such criticism and just sticks to .bit.

Now whenever it gets angry, it smashes the lives of its investors

I still look back through my transaction history in my Bitcoin core wallet and see the 350 BTC received/sent transactions and it makes me cry a bit.
After the first $30 bubble burst, I never expected it to get close again, so I sold as soon as it hit in the $20's!  Made a nice profit and thought I was so smart...

You can’t mind BTC profitably but you could do decently well with XMR (monero) if you have a decent GPU.

Your problem is with zebpay, not with Bitcoin.  They operate a business that profits off of transaction fees, that are in addition to miner transaction fees.
Go download Bitcoin core onto your computer and be in charge of what fees you choose to pay.

The U.S. has a population of 319.4 million while the global population is about 7.2 billion, according to the Census Bureau. That works out to a 4.4 percent share of the world's population.

Fuck your title OP. I refuse to watch your video if you're going to clickbait the title like this. 
Just tell me the law and what it affects in the title, and then I will watch the video to learn more.  The fuck you gotta try to be deceptive and trickery for?

No.  Politicians are as clueless as rocks when it comes to technical subjects like this, and will sell their opinions on the matter to whichever lobby is funding their campaign.  It's not about doing what makes sense strategically, but instead about whatever benefits that individual representative most at that time.

Are you asking what the advantages to a business accepting Bitcoin are?  Minimal transaction fees as compared to credit cards or PayPal, as well as no possibility of chargebacks.  
If you're asking for business models revolving around Bitcoin, you could try being an exchange or a bank.  Maybe an education or training class, or merchandising.  Whatever other business models exist for fiat money.

All the time, perpetually this has been a nonstop topic of discussion since 2011.  You will find many people of all sorts of mindsets, very many of whom agree with you.  
Here is something similar happening in our economy right now:
In states with "legal" marijuana, all sales have to be a cash-only business.  This is because despite the state laws for legalization, the fact remains that weed is still illegal at the federal level.  Several states in the union are in open defiance of federal law, and the federal government is currently just letting it happen as something of an experiment.  But the fact remains that it is illegal, and at any point in time, the DEA *can* seize all assets from any dispensary in a legal state.  For this reason, banks will not store the cash from a dispensary.  Dispensaries need to have huge safes with armed security because they largely operate on cash because some institutions don't want the risk that it can disappear at any time.  (Psst... bitcoin is an excellent, secure store of value for these businesses as compared to keeping $1M cash in the back vault)
Bitcoin shares some parallels.  Perhaps this barrier will prevent widespread adoption because some banks or other businesses don't want the potential risk of a government seizure of all assets on a whim.  It's a very real concern and shouldn't be minimized.
Or perhaps the government recognizes the difficulties and backlash that would be faced with any such seizure, and will choose to let it slide.
The point is, just because something can be used for illegal activity doesn't necessarily preclude it from being used by a much larger or wider audience.  
Bitcoin will always have value and I believe it will be a permanent part of humanity for many centuries.  The exact USD $$ value of a coin, however, is wildly unknown.

Oh. Well now I know my perspective is truly fucked. The scotch tape holding on the "bit coin" note would have to be several inches thick if it is proportional to the coin :-/

Yeah I had a ton of hope last month digging through an old hard drive, hoping my wallet would still have the 35 coins in it from 2011... nope, smart me would never have allowed me to just leave $40 sitting on a hard drive before decommissioning it like that!  Sadly my wallet was long empty

Monero is the only contender to overtake bitcoin some day. 
Also Namecoin will someday hit its tipping point for decentralized DNS, although it won’t be worth thousands as a currency

Good point; Gold has come down from that 1900 peak. We will see BTC drop back down to $50 or so soon enough. :)

I hate this. I've explained bitcoin to countless people. I try to explain the concept of fiat value and how the coins do actually represent work done as well. 
They just cling to this... "BTC have no value... They are just computer downloads" or some crap. These are the kinds of people I simply cannot convey logically how it works.

That almost looks like a giant chocolate, one of those coins with the gold foil.
