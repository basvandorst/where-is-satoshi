$500 half off sale

Don't forget you may have to pay estimated tax.

Ah, but we can make it relevant.
Anyone used oculus rift with minecraft? We can now use our oculus rift to mine bitcoins in "reality" instead of using our miners.
@_date: 2014-09-10 04:15:27
This is really good news.
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:31:01
I came into the comments just to see if anyone else commented on this. Not disappointed.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:13:35
Of course I can. I'm an expert.
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:58:35
I think OP got mixed up.
@_date: 2014-10-26 05:05:55
It's kind of brilliant, actually.

He again wouldn't, as his philosophy is to only invest in things he understands. He doesn't really ever invest in technology.
Any time Berkshire is investing in technology, it's going to be one of his two successors who made the decision, not him. Maybe they'd invest in a bitcoin company. No idea.

You do realize you're being a fence for stolen credit cards using that?
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:24:16
And we wonder why it's hard to get new people into the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:59:23
Watch out with these--you can only use them for tickets, not for fees.
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:18:39
You went to Jared!
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:03:09
Oh. Thanks for pointing that out. $500 verify
@_date: 2014-08-24 22:20:06
I see you don't understand what the word "borrowing" means.
Even on the gold standard, a government can issue bonds in exchange for interest to investors. You can go out today and buy a 30-year treasury bond--you give the government real fiat in exchange for a promise they will pay you back with interest.

Me too! Flight out is on Sunday, I'll stop by and join the cause (even though my money is actually out of gox--I was one of the lucky ones when some of the transactions were still flowing).
@_date: 2014-09-01 05:46:04
Sorry, he transferred.

I run 10,000 nodes?

With an announcement?

My first crash was the $30 crash. Man, that was terrifying. Both the crashes after that, I was kind of excited waiting for the crash.
This crash though, was a little scary for me. Usually the price goes sky-high before crashes, so having a down slope into more down slope was terrifying. I held, though. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 04:23:52
Just withdrew 3.3 BTC from MTG, no problem.

The speed of light is only perceived as absolute in a vacuum.
I'm not an expert, but my basic understanding is that a photon traveling through a medium (air, smoke, etc) hits and is absorbed by various atoms in that medium, which then release their own photons moving in the same direction as the original. In this way, we don't see light covering distance at the speed of light because there is a small pause between the photon being absorbed and the new photon released.
You'd be better off asking though.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:57:00
Eh. It'll be a value.

I know this one!
"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:49:13
I have to admit, I'm really surprised it took this long.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:06:46
So is the war over now?
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:08:44
It's sad it had to come to this. I'm not sure if he's incompetent, evil, or just stupid, but there's so many ways he could have handled this fiasco better.
Japanese prisons sound pretty rough, but at least they're better than US prisons. Hopefully he'll come out a wiser man than he went in.
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:28:17
Who made it angry?

If you predict collapse every year, you'll be correct when it happens!
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:43:13
Those are generous odds. So if I make 2000 wallets and send them to this guy, he'll put 4.3 BTC in them?
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:33:36
Yes, if you're going to get a financial advisor, you really need to get one with a fiduciary relationship.
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:00:51
This is really good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:27:44
Well, I guess you could always just page the info onto your magnetic strip.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:14:23
Nah, I bought some more at $250, so you're good.
@_date: 2015-10-25 08:13:24
So is this the small jump before the big jump or the small jump before the crash?
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:18:18
How this thread is normally--when the prices isn't spiking--is like that. Greedy, but mostly people who actually think bitcoin is a good technology and want to discuss it.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:27:06
By "destroy," I presume you mean "Nashx will keep the money for itself." Because there's really no way for anyone to know otherwise, and I can't imagine you would actually just destroy the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:06:42
Yep. Every time the price spikes, it just becomes an echo chamber of greed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:55:35
Me too. I saw the price at 80, and immediately started to transfer in $1000. Well, I can always take it out again if I don't get to rebuy at 50ish.
