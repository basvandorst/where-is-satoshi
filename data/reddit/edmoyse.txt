And did you buy your btc, or mine it?... basically I'm interested why people would actually *use* btc in brick &amp; mortar shops as opposed to investing or spending online

I think I might try to live exclusively off bitcoin for a month - could be fun... although I imagine my diet would be extremely limited

Interesting - how come you want to accept BTC?  Based in SF?

On the other hand, is a 0.00845 BTC coffee expensive?  How about tomorrow?... whereas a $3 coffee is much easier to judge.
What's the advantage of BTC as a currency over and above its value as a payment system?

Good shout - although I may starve waiting for the delivery

Hey, I'm the friend also working on this.  Nope - you'd be able to discover the nearest merchants to you + their bitcoin wallet address, then actually make a payment to them directly (ie no scanning of QR codes)

I hear a bitcoin sandwich is twice as tasty.
Was it with a mobile app, or something like shiftpayments?

Do you spend it more than cash/card though?

What kind of business are you?
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:24:37
Yea - they've got it coming.  Nice - love the bitcoin community!  
Do you actually buy things out in the real world too?  I know for merchants there's a big incentive because of the transaction fees... but I just don't know if there's enough consumer adoption yet to make it worth the merchant's hassle

Bitcoin's got to win!

But on the merchant side, they'll have to get verified to prevent someone pretending to be Starbucks.

e.g. buying a coffee at your local café

Looking into it ;)
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:04:04
Agreed - getting businesses on board could be tricky.  The way we're tackling this is making our own merchant app - so businesses get the advantages of a) converting to FIAT and b) changing wallet addresses.
Businesses never have to even open Wyre for it to work.  That's the advantage to them over BitPay/Coinbase... we know first hand that the person on the checkout often doesn't know how to use Coinbase/BitPay.
For businesses that don't use our merchant app, customers will still be able to find them, but will be prompted to scan a QR code at checkout.

How come?
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:52:50
Yea - that was a pretty big problem for Foursquare, but users don't just "check in" using Wyre.  They actually make transactions in bitcoin - which would make spoofing very expensive for them...
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:18:10
ok, no worries - just curious whether people are spending it to support btc or just because they have it or not spending it much at all (just exchanging it).  
@_date: 2014-09-27 20:04:27
Agreed - it's the product of speculation.  Adoption definitely isn't mass yet, but it's definitely rising dramatically - I've been surprised by the reaction of companies like PayPal and Square - it's great news for Bitcoin!

Hey, I'm one of the guys who made this - would love any feedback you have.
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:59:51
why not just spend cash/pay by card?
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:49:16
Absurd reasoning... BTC is a store of value, not an exclusive measure of wealth.  Redistribution has and will happen over time.
