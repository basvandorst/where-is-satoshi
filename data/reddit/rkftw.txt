Can it go back to the 2014 days so we can all pick some up? :)
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:44:42
It's always the best time to buy

That’s how I felt yesterday when I woke up :)
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:00:53
Cashapp is even worse IMO, don't buy bitcoin too much or else get hit with a ban lol.

I bought early, just saw the market rate in happiness :)
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:52:50
SAVED whenever I go there lol
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:04:46
I still have hope 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:05:51
It's been going down for the last few weeks :(
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:51:03
I knew it but it might come crashing down again in a heartbeat
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:31:44
Only 4%? I’m honestly up to buy some through coin star lol
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:01:15
Good to know whenever I travel to Europe some day :)
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:45:37
One click to half a billion dollars is insane 
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:57:27
Just invest in an amount you’re ok with, start little by little.

Only in Canada RIP
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:18:04
Good luck with barely any electricity as well 
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:01:25
The trend has been down since November and even went to $3500/600 recently, that’s what I meant. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:03:39
*The world may never know*
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:45:18
I personally would have waited until it went lower but nevertheless, good luck. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:45:36
Just keep holding

Have you tried adding money and then buying BTC? That’s one method that works for me 
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:11:09
I’ve been buying from SquareCash (personal use) ever since I got verified. It’s much easier than coinbase and it gets confirmed rather quickly. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:34:07
Have you gone to the BTC section through the app? That’s what I meant originally. The first time buying through the app is when they ask for ID verification which takes anywhere up to a week to get passed. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:26:00
You get your BTC instantly, have you tried verifying your identity for the first time buying BTC? That was the case for me and it only took a few days for them to accept me. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:47:12
You missed out for a good minute 
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:40:18
Did it let you buy BTC instantly? Maybe because I didn’t do it at first so that’s why I included my verification process. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:12:27
If on mobile, you should try cashapp. You only need to verify your identity and after that, you can buy BTC without the wait. The only bad thing is that you can’t receive on the app 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:28:22
Wish the best if it’s true OP
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:38:55
Good luck man and remember the motto.....
