that will be like going all in on nokia/blackberry stocks in early 2006 or something and saying i will lock it up for 10 years 
good luck with that.

I have been thinking about this , I mean , people lose stuff . we are fallible by nature . what exactly happens to all those lost bit coins ???....what if someone manages to lose like a million bitcoins or something due to an over sight (know its absurd but it can happen , like for  instance a bit coin hoarder   could end up in an accident or something and maybe die without sharing info ) ?....and considering there is a limit , isn't it detrimental in the long run that something can just become useless cause its in an eternal abyss?......iam sure if a fiat owning billionaire dies or loses his life due to an accident , his wealth doesn't get lost or anything , his natural heirs can access it ? , but what about em bitcoins ...just curious about its feasibility in the long run

@_date: 2017-09-15 13:13:13
see here mate , a whole bunch of people had placed orders at ~2950 mark during the Bull run , this has got triggered en masse and its gone up a bit due to this . but trends are still downwards . ofcourse i could be wrong .  
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:05:16
The ultimate ambition of Buying Bitcoin on the cheap is for Luddites like us , 
 whose main  concern is not to make this world free from the constraints of a centralized entity  but something as facile as being able to buy bitcoins super cheap so that they can turn into overnight bit coin millionaires and post memes after .
the Chinese govt  are probably more worried about capital outflow , keeping the dissenters in check , making sure the yuan doesn't get compromised and the likes .
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:33:59
China is not the US of A mate , when the govt says soemthing and warns you of somethign else , people panic and do everything that will get them to comply with the govts demand , coz the repercussions will be severe , people are wired differently there , tomorrow monring , once the average trader in China realises what has happend , the first thing hes gonna  do is sell evertything while he can (until the month end ) and certainly not buy or hodl some more.

@_date: 2017-09-15 07:55:19
exactly , with Bitcoin expect the unexcpected , but trust me , 
the Chinese and peoples emotions are huge control handles , it was on a massive Bull run thanks to the above two and right now its on an even bigger Bear run again thanks to the two . 
never underestimate peoples emotions , and combined with the Chinese ban on Bitcoin exchanges , things could get really messy really fast . and you know the best part of this is all , the November Hard fork (something akin to amputating your limbs coz technology is there to reduce the suffering )  that's when the shites gonna really hit the ceiling.
just some pointers really , coz the general vibe u get from this sub is naïve platitudes like "HODL" and buy the "dip" .
time for some sane voices to filter through midst the din.

its a perfect storm innit , CHina , Daemon , Hard fork (still cant understand why we need this shite ) and now this . 
bitcoin is going down to sub 2000 levels , all you long term HOLDers in the temporary millions should have sold (and still can) and buy in later after the cloud has settled.

@_date: 2017-09-15 09:04:02
I think they have sold out , there is no other explanation , who stands to gain by btc crashing and burning , the banks Ofcourse , what if they budget like 10 million dollars in destroying btc , they benefit in the long term .
This hard fork seems like an inside job to destroy btc really 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:56:46
wtf is china having this kind of influence ???.
what's the point of a decentralized currency if one country can manipulate it to this extent . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:09:17
the truth . guys dont just hodl like machines. ofcourse , hodl only what you can afford to lose , but this is a proper bear run and its only the start , if its a loan or your life savings or something thats really dear to you , please recoup while you can and live to fight another day , i have a gut feeling that , once China wakes up (its 3am there now ) and realises the rumours are true . they are gonna absolutely get rid of it all and its a friday tomorrow too , so could easily hit 2200 or there abouts by the month end (which is the deadline ) . so be warned guys and dont just HODL for the sake of it . only hodl what you can afford to lose. and if you are a day trader , simple mantra get out when u see 15 - 20 % of your investemnt disappear. not worth the risk .

lol is that sarcasm . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:28:38
All this is true if Bitcoin continues being profitable i.e. Continues on its upward trajectory , if btc were to hit 2 k and beyond you might expect Putin to close the file for now  . 
Russia has bigger things to worry about and sink its ever decreasing billions  on , and it's not a fast sinking  btc 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:58
hmm seems like a resistance was reached , and people getting up in the states looked at the price and bought some . 
could be some support that takes it up to 3300 but could come down real quick too . 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:44:09
GAWD , yea we get it , its beautiful .
but lets get real guys , the reason bitcoin is where it is , is not because it solves the worlds problem  or because its gonna bring a revolution of sorts . NO, its simple , people are speculating the shite out of it , and thanks to its unregulated volatile state , its perfect breeding grounds for a bunch of whales to work the market and make  easy money . 
thats exactly  what is happening right now, the sooner u guys see this , the better. 
and yes , i believe in bitcoin .

easily 1700 $ levels and below if things stay the same. and god save everybody if it hits 1700$ coz , bitcoin will completely lose its integrity . 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:13:50

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:35:09
wow if you dont have the patience to do simple research and find the trustworthy exchanges or platforms , then i dont think bitcoin is for you , look at it this way , you lost what , 270$??? , you could have lost way more considering whats happening right now, exacerbated with an attitude like that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:39:34

@_date: 2017-09-15 09:24:30
Or due to his intransigence , btc will crash and burn ( considering there is a stupid hard  fork in November which is like taking a chainsaw to the balls ) and the entire market will get wiped out .
How can a state actors manipulation ever be healthy ??? Btc will lose its integrity if what you say is true , and the bear run will completely overwhelm it . 
Perfect storm really .
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:41:13
yeah , absolutely , the Bear run staring at your face is just fake news . go ahead buy some more bitcoins . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:45:10
hmm try selling some of em , it might be a long while before we see 4000 ever again , rather sell now and buy after the dust has settked and BTC hits bottom . (could be sub 2000 by the way things are going ) 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:38:10
exactly , and the funny thing is , they would be worse than china , iam sure putin loves the idea that some of his cronies can siphon of their ill gotten wealth just like that. if there is one thing these dictators hate , it is capital outflow and losing control over the capital . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:16:53
And then it will crash and burn inThe November hard fork , or maybe everybody will double their btc with equal amount of "Bitcoin beta " or what ever they call the abomination .

could be , but maybe just maybe , your average chinese trader would have clued in to the fact that his over lords have decided to ban cryto 
 exchanges and the deadline to cease all transactions is the month end????,,,,maybe after hearing this above news you would buy some more , but iam guessing the immediate reaction would be to recoup what you can . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:36:52

Be careful of what you say 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:41:49
nobody has a clue buddy . 
seems like the bad news is out , and we are on a bearish trend of sorts (inspite the spike which i attribute to market manipulation by the bankers , and also a lot of 2900 buys getting triggered along with a bunch of shorts ) 
based on whats out and the Chinese trying to get out while they still can(its mid night there so you could see some movement downwards in a few hours ) ,the price should go down , but then again it could bounce back , i think 2900 has a lot of resistance , and if that gets breached , 2600 or 2700 is anotehr round number where you might see a bounce back to the existing value . 
its all about timing buddy , and riding the wave and buying and selling  . huge potential to make a killing in day trading .
huge speculation going on right now , with a lot of uncertainity and market forces in play . 
if you have money to burn , you can play i guess.
not the best time to speculate on your life savings though 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:57:24
the bits and pieces you lose on trasnfer fees and what not might wipe out your profits , and worse , if bitcoin dips further then it might become a bit of a mess.
dont do it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:18:25
Don't go blindly in now , it's just the start of a bear run , perfect storm really , China , daemon on national tv deriding Bitcoin , November hard fork , ... Things gonna get real messy real fast ( hope most of the long term holders in the temporary millions  sold at the 5000 mark and bought in later  ) .
Could easily get to sub 2000 levels and then some more , patience , and basically having bullets now and not pulling  the trigger is what many experienced hands are doing . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:16:53
And then it will crash and burn inThe November hard fork , or maybe everybody will double their btc with equal amount of "Bitcoin beta " or what ever they call the abomination . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:27
that is valid , yes , if the future was a bit unclear and the dip seemed random , yes buy in small increments. 
but right now , its pretty clear , the Chinese banning of exhanges is not a rumour anymore , there is a deadline in place , and even worse ,a hard fork (which is like the worst thing u could do right now thanks to a bunch of deluded control freaks) is in the horizon , its so obvious , theres gonna be a massive bear run . this is not your standard FUD either. 
so isnt it easier to wait , and not blowing your load in small increments and having nothing to shoot when it gets really wet . ?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:40:40
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:58:52
only if the trajectory is upwards , if it hits 2k , then believe it or not , btc has a higher chance of hitting 1 k and beyond  . 
,  its a perfect storm really , Daemon calling bitcoin a scam , china trolling everybody under the bitcoin sun , and to add insult to injury , a bunch of deluded control freaks forcing a hard fork in november , just so bitcoin can completely get wiped out as long as their egos get satiated. easily 1700 $ levels and below if things stay the same. and god save everybody if it hits 1700$ coz , bitcoin will completely lose its integrity and crash and burn . Russia is many things but it aint stupid to invest in a sinking ship and even if they did , they will just fill in Chinas role of endless trolling and manipulating for their own agendas and certainly not with BTC best intersts in mind   .
wake up and realise as qucikly as you can , that the last three weeks of Bull run was a huge bubble , bledy newbs buying into the "get rich quick scheme " and a bunch of asian traders buying btc like no tomorrow . super weak hands the lot .

o my sweet summer child , if only we could read crytpo like that and if only crytpo was that predictable . we would all be rolling in the millions. history will not always repeat itself and trying to read patterns in the crypto universe is a fools errand really. 
but one pattern has held true for a while , China , they can make or break bitcoin and the yhave done it several times already . along with the Daemon guy announcing on live tv that bitcoin is a scam and the the completely unecessary hard fork in novmeber . things could get messy really fast . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:31:03

Beijing time and not what you think .
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:42
not at all .
its like a proper bear run now , (its just started ) and I think it will be proportional to the bull run , 
a perfect storm really , CHina banning bitcoin exchanges , Daimon calling bitcoin a scam in national tv , the completely unnecessary hard fork in November . it kinda adds up . 
once the 3200 resistance is breached , its only one way ,and that's down , could easily reach 2000 and beyond , bitcoin relies on emotions to an extent I have not seen anywhere else . 
SHort it if you can , or better SODL and buy in later and still be in the green . my reserved advice. 
I myself bought in at 3800 and quickly realised I caught it cold , and sold it at 3300 .(iam glad I did ) 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:50:42
If it goes to 2000 , then the question becomes if it will go to 1000 $ , Bitcoin is some thing that thrives on momentum and right now it's the wrong sort of momentum . 
Iam afraid if it goes further down it will lose all its integrity , the idea of a state actor manipulating it for its own agenda is not gonna do it any Favours either .
But what I absolutely don't understand is , considering the negative vibes and the govt crackdowns , why the fuck are they going through with a hard fork in November ????, isn't that like the worst thing you could do right now , a bit like " ok guys , seems like the Chinese and Daemon have done the groundwork , now let's complete the job and run Bitcoin to the ground " 
I mean like seriously wtf is the point of this hard fork and why are we allowing it ??
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:50:56
if only it was as simple as that , the assumption that nobody should sell if they dont want to see their investment tank is flawed in its premise . thats not how it works , people need to sell to see their gains , if everybdy just bought  and HODL , then how in the world is anybody supposed to make any money out of it , besides there are many day traders and speculators who have bought into bitcoin for the quick $ , and as principled investors , they do their resaerch and look at the trends and have stop gap measures in place (usually set at 15-20 % of your investment gets wiped out and the trends point downwards ),and if things go south ,  they quit , and live to fight anotehr day.not everybody has disposable income that they forget about for a few months and sleep in peace.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:10:39

Haha , u should go to Russia and see the state of the country , USA is many things ,  weak ain't one of Em  , and once it gets a hang of Russia's scheming and its using if Bitcoin as a tool for world domination  , then u can bid adieu to it . Uncle Sam has till now turned a blind eye to bit coin , if it ever were to feel an itch of sorts , things could get really bad . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:19:37
just a platitude mate . ofcourse if you invst like 10 k and there is a major bear run , and you see your investment tank due to a state actor conspiring against it , the right thing to do would be to cut your loses then and there and recoup what you can , not act dumb and say you only lose money if u sell and watch your capital disappear in front of your eyes . the HODL only works if you can afford to lose your investment and not your peace of mind or sleep , if not , then please recoup what you can .
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:04:53
and a whale dropping it all as we speak . 
crazy this is .
it seems if u have like 200 bitcoins , and you sell em , the price plummets and then a bit down the line , you buy the 200 bitcoins bak , the value goes up again . 
also feels like there is a cue , so as soon as a signal is given , everybody dumps and vice versa .
there is a really big whale/whales doing this in tandem and manipulating the shite out of it and raking in the $$$$

how absurd , its a bear run you are inviting just coz you want to buy em cheap . if this gets worse , once the chinese get out of their beds , shites gonna hit the ceiling. and the recent bull run , it was all thanks to the good publicity and a bunch of newbs piling in , and most importantly the chinese buying into bitcoin wholeheartedly . and now , if you have crap like the Daimon guy calling bitcoin a scam on live tv and A would be super power in China banning bitcoin , then it is a recipe for disaster , ofcourse you can buy ur cheap bitcoins , but it will be of no use to anyone . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:08:11
Sold it at 3400 , realized i caught it cold . O well , 500 dollar hit but I live to fight another day . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:04:02
I think they have sold out , there is no other explanation , who stands to gain by btc crashing and burning , the banks Ofcourse , what if they budget like 10 million dollars in destroying btc , they benefit in the long term .
This hard fork seems like an inside job to destroy btc really 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:05:16
The ultimate ambition of Buying Bitcoin on the cheap is for Luddites like us , 
 whose main  concern is not to make this world free from the constraints of a centralized entity  but something as facile as being able to buy bitcoins super cheap so that they can turn into overnight bit coin millionaires and post memes after .
the Chinese govt  are probably more worried about capital outflow , keeping the dissenters in check , making sure the yuan doesn't get compromised and the likes .
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:15:47
i bought at 3600 , a whole bitcoin , sold at 3300 , (am a day trader btw ) shites gonna hit the fan  when the chinese wake up from their slumber 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:38:15
all men must sleep 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:03:40
depends on the chinese reaction when they wake up , if they start panic selling , it will surely exacerbate the bear run . and worse , if the US gets up a few hours later and finds out a bear run is on its way , all the newbs and day traders will pull out with what they can and send the bitcoin to a downward spiral , things could get worse really. we might be in the cusp of a massive bear run. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:22:59
i think if that happens , then few years down the line , there will be a shite load of unsold lambos coz bitcoin will be no where to be seen . 
to put it simply , if bitcoin tanks to 100$ or a two digit figure from the highs of August , then people will not go and hoard more bitcoins , what will happen is bitcoin will lose its allure and most importantly its integrity . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:27:10
o my sweet summer child , if only we could read crytpo like that and if only crytpo was that predictable . we would all be rolling in the millions. history will not always repeat itself and trying to read patterns in the crypto universe is a fools errand really. 
but one pattern has held true for a while , China , they can make or break bitcoin and the yhave done it several times already . along with the Daemon guy announcing on live tv that bitcoin is a scam and the the completely unecessary hard fork in novmeber . things could get messy really fast . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:13:50
Wow , talk about completely missing the point , 
A bit like saying mobile  phones  are dirt cheap now , almost as cheap as pagers back in the day so Ofcourse all mobile phones are gonna turn into pagers overnight .
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:18:25
Don't go blindly in now , it's just the start of a bear run , perfect storm really , China , daemon on national tv deriding Bitcoin , November hard fork , ... Things gonna get real messy real fast ( hope most of the long term holders in the temporary millions  sold at the 5000 mark and bought in later  ) .
Could easily get to sub 2000 levels and then some more , patience , and basically having bullets now and not pulling  the trigger is what many experienced hands are doing . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:41:49
bro, shites gonna hit the fan when the chinese wake up , just be warned .i know everybody says to hodl, but still , what goes up will come down 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:14:08
once the chinese traders realise whats happened , i.e the rumours are true , they aint gonna hodl shite or buy some more , they will throw em bitcoins away like a sack of spuds.  this is just the start of the bear run . dont blindly go heads in , whenever it hits a new low , there is a slight resitance and it comes a bit bak up only to sink further down ,and yep only invest what you can afford to lose but the writings on the wall . bitcoin is gonna lose a lot more before it stabilises coz the chinese have it by the balls right now . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:29:46
mother RUssia , they have got our backs ofcourse. amirit?
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:50:42
If it goes to 2000 , then the question becomes if it will go to 1000 $ , Bitcoin is some thing that thrives on momentum and right now it's the wrong sort of momentum . 
Iam afraid if it goes further down it will lose all its integrity , the idea of a state actor manipulating it for its own agenda is not gonna do it any Favours either .
But what I absolutely don't understand is , considering the negative vibes and the govt crackdowns , why the fuck are they going through with a hard fork in November ????, isn't that like the worst thing you could do right now , a bit like " ok guys , seems like the Chinese and Daemon have done the groundwork , now let's complete the job and run Bitcoin to the ground " 
I mean like seriously wtf is the point of this hard fork and why are we allowing it ??
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:52:45
u did good , better live to fight another day , and the stress is just aint worth it . its a perfect storm really , Daemon calling bitcoin a scam , china trolling everybody under the bitcoin sun , and to add insult to injury , a bunch of deluded control freaks forcing a hard fork in november , just so bitcoin can completely get wiped out as long as their egos get satiated. 
easily 1700 $ levels and below if things stay the same. and god save everybody if it hits 1700$ coz , bitcoin will completely lose its integrity . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:55:11
wtf did i just read. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:57:31
am pretty sure china doesnt run on mining . 
what they want to do , is stop the capital outflow . 
wouldnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that bitcoin is antithetical to a centralised govt controlled  entity of sorts. 
people are taking their wealth out of the country through bitcoins.
China has,or for that matter any govt body has  more to gain by banning .
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:23:26
o gawd , iam telling you . this is just the start of the bear run . this sub is in need of some sane voices too , way too much of blind optimism.

@_date: 2017-09-14 22:28:45
sodl and buy later at sub 2000 levels, 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:41:49
bro, shites gonna hit the fan when the chinese wake up , just be warned .i know everybody says to hodl, but still , what goes up will come down 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:22:10
are u sure it was pizzas u ate there ? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:42
not at all .
its like a proper bear run now , (its just started ) and I think it will be proportional to the bull run , 
a perfect storm really , CHina banning bitcoin exchanges , Daimon calling bitcoin a scam in national tv , the completely unnecessary hard fork in November . it kinda adds up . 
once the 3200 resistance is breached , its only one way ,and that's down , could easily reach 2000 and beyond , bitcoin relies on emotions to an extent I have not seen anywhere else . 
SHort it if you can , or better SODL and buy in later and still be in the green . my reserved advice. 
I myself bought in at 3800 and quickly realised I caught it cold , and sold it at 3300 .(iam glad I did ) 
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:29:22
theres a whale right now dumpong bitcoins like no tomorrow , 
very volatile and certainly no consolidation

and rinse and repeat .
is this what bitcoin has come to . 
and people while being sheep , are also clever sheep , they wont facilitate the bubble again and worse , bitcoin will lose its integrity . 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:27:07
I don't get it  , 
are people this uninformed . 
we are at the start of a bear run , China banning exhanges , Daemon on national TV calling bitcoin a scam and worse , the totally arbitrary November hard fork . its a perfect storm people , just coz bitcoin was at 5000 a week back , and you wake up and see the dips , don't go all in thinking that it will go back up to it ATH . 
take a step back and realise , that its a huge bear run now , bigger than the bull run it was in for a while . 
things are heading south now , so your misplaced optimism is startling . ofcourse bitcoin is here to stay but there is a time and place to invest In it, and right now having a loaded gun and not pulling the trigger is what many experienced hands are doing . watching and waiting for the bottom to fall of .
wait for the month end (the deadline for Chinese exchanges to terminate transactions ) if its still heading south , then wait for mid October (the Chinese govt reshuffle ) if immediately after things look optimistic , then invest a bit , if not , then wait for the November hard fork , coz thats when shites gonna really hit the ceiling , we could see sub 2000 $ and beyond in that time frame if not sooner . 
please don't listen to the naïve idealogues with their HODL and buy the "dip " platitudes. look at trends and the emotions involved and most importantly the Chinese Govt, bitcoin is something that is influenced greatly by emotions and the Chinese and the recent price bump is partly due to the newbs who bought into the hype and the dream of a :get rich quick" scheme and the Chinese buying up bitcoins like no tomorrow,
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:16:58
fuk off 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:14:27
that is valid , yes , if the future was a bit unclear and the dip seemed random , yes buy in small increments. 
but right now , its pretty clear , the Chinese banning of exhanges is not a rumour anymore , there is a deadline in place , and even worse ,a hard fork (which is like the worst thing u could do right now thanks to a bunch of deluded control freaks) is in the horizon , its so obvious , theres gonna be a massive bear run . this is not your standard FUD either. 
so isnt it easier to wait , and not blowing your load in small increments and having nothing to shoot when it gets really wet . ?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:38:10
exactly , and the funny thing is , they would be worse than china , iam sure putin loves the idea that some of his cronies can siphon of their ill gotten wealth just like that. if there is one thing these dictators hate , it is capital outflow and losing control over the capital . 
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:56:04
I sold at 3300 , bought in at 3800 , but logic and bear run is staring at my face , no reason to act dumb and HODL now . will buy in later , I have play money now , took a hit yes , but live to fight another day 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:28:58
hmm seems like a resistance was reached , and people getting up in the states looked at the price and bought some . 
could be some support that takes it up to 3300 but could come down real quick too .

and bought in again after the cloud has settled this year end or after the hard fork .
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:19:37
just a platitude mate . ofcourse if you invst like 10 k and there is a major bear run , and you see your investment tank due to a state actor conspiring against it , the right thing to do would be to cut your loses then and there and recoup what you can , not act dumb and say you only lose money if u sell and watch your capital disappear in front of your eyes . the HODL only works if you can afford to lose your investment and not your peace of mind or sleep , if not , then please recoup what you can .
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:45:16
haha , yeah right , maybe in the books , but China really does have HK by the balls , but yes you can say that to yourself if that makes u feel better.

i do understand that mate ....iam many things , but iam not dense . but to see the principle behind an entity getting compromised , and for a country to have this kind of power over it , its saddening really . bitcoin came along promising that  it would prevent this kind of manipulation from state actors. i dont really care whether it hits the sky or sinks , but to see it so blatantly being used by a state actor with ulterior motives has lead me to come to the conclusion that bitcoin is just another brick in the wall.

if only it was as simple as that , the assumption that nobody should sell if they dont want to see their investment tank is flawed in its premise . thats not how it works , people need to sell to see their gains , if everybdy just bought  and HODL , then how in the world is anybody supposed to make any money out of it , besides there are many day traders and speculators who have bought into bitcoin for the quick $ , and as principled investors , they do their resaerch and look at the trends and have stop gap measures in place (usually set at 15-20 % of your investment gets wiped out and the trends point downwards ),and if things go south ,  they quit , and live to fight anotehr day.not everybody has disposable income that they forget about for a few months and sleep in peace.

China is not the US of A mate , when the govt says soemthing and warns you of somethign else , people panic and do everything that will get them to comply with the govts demand , coz the repercussions will be severe , people are wired differently there , tomorrow monring , once the average trader in China realises what has happend , the first thing hes gonna  do is sell evertything while he can (until the month end ) and certainly not buy or hodl some more.

its a perfect storm innit , CHina , Daemon , Hard fork (still cant understand why we need this shite ) and now this . 
bitcoin is going down to sub 2000 levels , all you long term HOLDers in the temporary millions should have sold (and still can) and buy in later after the cloud has settled.

i think if that happens , then few years down the line , there will be a shite load of unsold lambos coz bitcoin will be no where to be seen . 
to put it simply , if bitcoin tanks to 100$ or a two digit figure from the highs of August , then people will not go and hoard more bitcoins , what will happen is bitcoin will lose its allure and most importantly its integrity .

All this is true if Bitcoin continues being profitable i.e. Continues on its upward trajectory , if btc were to hit 2 k and beyond you might expect Putin to close the file for now  . 
Russia has bigger things to worry about and sink its ever decreasing billions  on , and it's not a fast sinking  btc

i feel things are really sketchy and major manipulation happening , better to wait it out , the current raises , feels like a proper pump and next up will be the dump
