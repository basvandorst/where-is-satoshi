Just a vision:
You have an app, just like Apple Pay or google pay or Samsung pay or android pay. 
Call it Bitcoin Pay. It’s actually just a wrapper for opening closing Lightningchannels. 
Create new Bitcoin Pay wallet: 0$ 
Add funds to it: transfer fee applies. If you don’t mind waiting the fee is much less. 
Now any money there is “useable” aka sent via lightning network. 
One you run out, you top it off some more from cold storage / ledger and pay the transfer fee. 
That’s it! 
What a glorious and nice wallet!

This is false. Alts are simply an experiment and will get absorbed into BTC somewhere down the line. Don’t fall for Alts are superior crap. BTC is the dominant coin and has been forever. The alt fuckers only ever dream of the flippening but it has NEVER happened so BTC is still Supreme

Yes, Bitcoin is overloaded. It shot from, what, 2000$ to $19000 within a year. We are sure our amazing developers are going to fix this as soon as they can. This doesnt mean the protocol is messed up, its just having a hard time scaling at this level.
I'm sick of BCASH users saying "lets abandon ship, fellow kids". No. And IF, big IF, we were to abandon ship, BCASH would be the last one to go to. Why?
It's a shitcoin compared to already well performing, faster, cheaper, more decentralized coins. 
tl;dr - fuck off bchashers.

Oh. It stands for The Red Pill and is an edgy reference to The Matrix where Morpheus gives NEO two options (pills) whether to stay in dreamland (blue pill) or wake up to reality (red pill).

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:07:29
Well grounded post. Just want to point out that some of the criticisms may not be valid at a future date. The protocol is still being developed and while we may perceive Bitcoin stepped into the stage as a finessed fighter ready to knock out current king (fiat) it’s not really the case. 
Instead it’s a very very new and infantile technology that has a loooooong way to go. We are still in alpha stage. 
At this stage I see a lot of old money economists defend fiat and the fiat world and how bitcoin will fail. This is hilarious because 1 that sort of change does NOT happen overnight so any get rich quick guys, sorry. 2 bitcoin is not ready. Quirks are being ironed out. This whole “bitcoin consumes too much electricity” is a valid concern now but it’s a problem that has the potential to be solved via increasing miner efficiency or hell even core protocol changes. It’s not a “oh hell man I went to the store to buy a loaf of bread and it’s half yeast, what the hell is this shit?” Well it’s not bread yet. Don’t buy it. There’s no company you’re going to sue cuz they pushed this “defective” product on to you. Don’t buy it. It’s a collaborative project and nature of such projects is that it’s slow moving and has decision making overhead. 
Basically I feel Bitcoin breaking into mainstream was sort of a mistake as it attracted people who assumed it was this finished product and they’re used to writing reviews that might help their fellow consumers so they see bitcoin as an unfinished product which is sort of is. 
Sit back and wait to see how the project goes ahead. It may not break your expectations but it’s built on hard work and interest of thousands of individuals. It’s very much an experiment at this moment so treating it as a battle hardened veteran is ... wrong. I understand a lot of fiat lovers are annoyed by the fact that btc backers think fiat is gonna be killed by btc. Fair enough. But not today :)

Curious. Are you being sarcastic?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:29:32
Here’s your answer, Luddite. This (high fees slow tx) was not built in. Bitcoin is not a product you buy from a company. It’s a work in progress. At this current snapshot in time we have high fees and slow txns because adoption is just crazy. Devs ARE working on a solution. Just because the lines are overcrowded today isn’t the death of bitcoin. Yes we could do better but give the fucking devs some room to breathe. It may be magic internet money that just works for you but for people on the infrastructure side it’s a lot of work and headaches so that it can work for you. 
Yes there are faster coins. Bcash isn’t on top of that list. If you want faster and cheaper find one of the hundreds of altcoins then. Bcash is corporate bullshit avoid it like the plague. 
Did I mention FUCK BCASH?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:31:42

I'm a non-native English speaker so I've tailored it for a similar demographic. Here's my attempt.
- Money that uses the internet as a bank. 
- Anyone with access to the internet can send or receive Bitcoins, almost instantly.
- You can open as many accounts as you want, free of cost, at the click of a button.
- Bitcoins can be spent, like regular money, at places which accept them. That list is expanding. 
- transactions are secure and transparent. 
- bitcoin owners are themselves shareholders of the communal 'bank'. 
- no one can restrict where you spend your money

I'm not up to date on the specifics but I heard the total amount of BTC that's missing is 600k right?
That's enough to crash any exchange. 
What if it's a planned move by a government/bank in fear of BTC's successful adoption rate. If more people join, they will soon be out of a business so they can potentially 'nuke' exchanges to falter trust on BTC. 
Off course this eventually works better for the masses as it helps spread out BTC. But the price rise might take a while considering trust has been shaken. 
Just some thoughts. It could be anything. It could also be this.

Hi, I'm a newcomer but didn't see this answered yet, so pardon me:
Why don't people just withdraw their BTC from Mt.Gox and sell them elsewhere (localbitcoins)? 
I would do this were I in similar situation because I know my localbitcoins has people willing to buy BTC. 
EDIT: I just realized that maybe people who put money into Mt. Gox were only in it for day trading (i.e. - making a quick buck) rather than caring about owning actual bitcoin. Yes?

Bitcoin is decentralized because most miners use ASIC factories? What? Sorry but I cannot see how you think bitcoin is decentralized when regular tom and jerries cannot mine independently on cpu+gpu. Miners now have become huge corporate entities. 
I’ve been a bitcoin supporter since the beginning but I’ve always feared that ASICS have now centralized mining to only those who can afford it. Yes it would be awesome to be truly decentralized but it’s far from it.

Hey there! 
Yea I guess a handful of us exist ;)
You put an interesting proposition. Out in the wild, the only currency is FIAT currency but some of the guides are pretty savvy when it comes to using new technology (fb/skype etc). Maybe these guides could accept bit coin and they in turn take care of your trekking package and pay off locals in FIAT money. Which is what they do anyways (take a 1-time all inclusive dollar payment). The only problem is that since BTC is so new, there wouldn't be anywhere for them to spend it (which is good too as price is steadily increasing). 
For now I was thinking of setting up an informal exchange point for BTC to NPR and vice versa. 
You are always welcome to visit. It's harsh but I think that part is masked a lot by what you see/experience up there in the Himalayas.

From another third world country (Nepal), hugs. Maybe you could initiate something at the local exchange shops and persuade a couple to accept bitcoins. That way incoming tourists can carry less fiat and straight out exchange their BTC for local fiat and you have an option to buy that BTC from them.

I just want to brainstorm some names. We could use the names for any arbitrary amount that makes sense right now. It's purpose would be to reduce the price of the product to something quick and easy to calculate.
eCoin/iCoin - like eMail or iMessage or something. Right now 1 BTC ~ $550. So 1 eCoin = 1/100th of a bit coin. so 1 eCoin = $5.5. Have a cup of coffee, pay 1 eCoin. 
Toshi - And when the value deflates, we can progressively move to Satoshis. 
Chip(s) - Nice and round and you can buy things with them. Or play online poker. 
Malta - I just want two fork on the table.
jaBoTiCaba - Umm just has BTC in it. Also has a shamanic ring to the name. P.S Its a real word.
Peanut(s) - "Like my shirt? I got it for peanuts."
Sorry couldn't help it. Thanks for reading.

basically it means that if you want to get out of work fast, and you keep looking at the clock every minute, you're gonna have a bad time. Just focus on work and it will end before u know it.
same with btc - if we give too many shits about the price right now, we're gonna have a bad time.

Checking in from Nepal. BTC here is almost nonexistent. Only ONE seller on localbitcoins. We have a super small community over at However I doubt if the government will allow BTC to flourish as it puts already existing traders at risk. 
For example, currently, you can only buy a max of 25,000 Indian rupees (USD $317) with government consent. Obviously with BTC you can easy circumvent current policies. 
People are buying more for speculative increase in wealth.
Anyhow, I am super excited about adopting this new form of currency and have high hopes for the future of world-wide commerce.

Your concerns are valid. You decided to invest in an emerging technology. You placed your bets and the hand you've been dealt might not be satisfactory. 
But why does any of that have to dampen the fact that Bitcoin is capable of so much more. People are already calling bitcoin a failure because why, because it's prices are momentarily plummeting. That's not a valid reason why bitcoin is failing. It would fail if there was any easy way to double-spend. It would fail if someone sent someone else some btc and it never reached him. 
I'm sorry if I ticked you off with my rant. I feel it's unfair to put so much pressure and expectations on such new technology and not give it the breathin space it needs. 
Tl;dr - LEAVE BITCOIN ALONE :((
@_date: 2013-11-15 12:06:32
As BTC grows in popularity, and price, we will see people trying to use it for their personal profits. But what this YiFu guy is doing is taking something public and making it exclusive. 
This is a very dangerous time for BTC because if him and his cronies are successful, we are robbed of our own wealth, in front of our own eyes. 
They will take the system and use it for their exclusive profit. 
How do we protect ourselves? Through a mutual understanding in our community. A code of ethics that miners and buyers and sellers alike will need to follow. Why to follow? To ensure that our power is not usurped.
I do not have the list of ethics to follow but I do have a faint idea of what it could contain. Maybe everyone can participate to create this list.
Let us suppose the population of earth is 100 people. So far everyone is using fiat money. BTC is invented. Now 7 people use it and want it to spread to the entire world. But 2 people want to hog BTC for themselves, knowing that it has potential to be accepted worldwide, and also knowing that if they can control the currency, they can control the world. So they advertise to the remaining people in the world saying that a superior form of currency is available and they are the sole providers. They push the 7 people using BTC off the table, and snatch all their BTCs and sell them out to the rest of the world. Being the only seller give them immense power. 
How to stop them from taking over? If the rest of the world somehow knew to check with the original 7 people before listening to the 2 idiots. The original community should be the source of all knowledge and information on bitcoin and not the 2 jerk wads trying to get rich by selling everyone out.
I know that we hate centralization of power, but in this case rather than an individual or an organization, it could be an entire community. Cause without this protective "mother hen" to watch over the interests of the BTC users, there may come some malicious users who just take everything into their hands and lay claim to it. 
I am half-serious as I am half-joking when I say that we could create a country, without geographical constraints, running on a Bitcoin economy, where the citizens are anyone who uses the currency.

Why does Mr. Satoshi require that amount to be richest? Is his bitcoin stash public information?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:39:14
I really don't know. 
Exchanges are places where the classic supply and demand negotiate the price. How much one is willing to pay for a BTC, or mBTC, depends some function of its speculative value and its perceived value. With Bitcoins it is further complicated by the fact that there aren't many places where you can spend them, although that's certainly changing by the day. 
So if you want a Bitcoin, why do you want a Bitcoin? How much are you willing to pay for it? Usually, and the exact numerical value may be different for different people, the answer is x amount of dollars and depending on your NEED for it, up-to x+y amount of dollars. 
Now lets switch to seller's perspective. 
At what price would you be willing to part with your Bitcoin? If you bought it at $900 and someone (the buyer above) is willing to pay $1100 for it, you might sell your BTC to him. That's fine if you are the only seller in the market (you could even 'auction' it off to the highest 'bidder'). But when there are more sellers, then there is price competition. You might be asking for $1100 but there might be another seller who needs the money urgently and offer it out at $1000. 
And finally, the speculative side that affects both sellers and buyers. If 'good' news is afloat about bitcoin, then buyer feels he needs to buy NOW. Seller is hesitant because value is expected to rise. After all if he sells for $1100 today, and next week, buyers are willing to pay up to $1800 for a Bitcoin then you lost your opportunity to make some bucks!
Now lets consider an example of 'bad' news. China tells its banks that they can't trade in BTC. Why is this bad? Because if the banks could trade in BTC, then it would have a higher 'velocity', which is the rate at which money changes hands, which means people are using BTC for trade, which they are doing already, but on a bigger scale! Your bitcoin is now more valuable because it is accepted more. 
Imagine you had a green rock and tried to use it to trade it for a juicy goat. You'd be hard pressed to find someone to accept your offer. But if suddenly green rocks began to be used as an acceptable form of currency, your options increase; your utility increases; your green rock is now more valuable.
So basically the more people using Bitcoins to trade things, the higher in value it climbs. But China said NO. And my interpretation of this NO is that they don't want to muddle up an already working fiat system with the new Bitcoin system because it probably requires them spend more money to integrate it into their economy. That doesn't mean they rang the death knell for Bitcoin. If anything, the fact that they have considered BTC a viable form of currency in itself is good news! But again that's my interpretation of it and many BTC owners disagree. Which is why they're bailing out. 
So sensing a deeper crash, they are trying to sell now so that their profit does not diminish further. So whereas in a bullish market a seller is kind of hesitant to sell even for $1100 when he bought it for $900, in the complementary bearish market, he will try to sell as fast as he can so he makes at least some profit (ex: at $950) or to minimize loss (ex: at $850). In this kind of market, the buyer will have lots of choices to buy from since people are willing to part with their BTC so easily that they will have to offer a cheaper price than their competitor to get rid of their stash. This results in market price of BTC to go down.
I can't tell you when to buy because it is impossible to predict when good news will come by to make the market bullish. I can only tell you that I believe in the power of the Bitcoin and its network and it has potential to solve so many problems in our fiat run world. 
As with any investment, you should do your homework and read up on the product and more importantly be willing to risk something to achieve a higher (perceivable goal).
For now, I'm holding onto my coins :)
