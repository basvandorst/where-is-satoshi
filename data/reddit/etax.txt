You do realize that it's unwise to make declarative statements about someone's entire career after reading two off-the-cuff blog posts?

There will always be thieves and idiots just like there are in the dollar economy.  Over time people will get used to internet currency and the idea of blaming it for the stupid things people do with it will seem as outlandish as blaming the dollar for Madoff.

Open your eyes.  The views on this subreddit are anything but uniform.  The debates never stop.  This is one of the most contentious forums in existence.  Dozens of devoted critics such as yourself spend hours a day playing devil's advocate, or just being cranky and useless.  Do you really expect people to just say 'o sorry yer right ok bye'?

Why does the media look at the world and see nothing but fashion?

He's not a supercilious snob, more like an alpha bro trying to 'dominate' the internet.

You got your panties in a twist over the 7th word in the title and totally missed that this post is about bitcoin.org.

People who want total privacy can use monero.  I have heard that it will soon be possible to pay with monero to any bitcoin address using shapeshift.io but it seems the dev is dragging his feet a bit.

More to the point, community is not even an adequate basis for an alternative currency.  Don't forget, communities have an inside *and* an outside, and the outside is usually much much bigger.  They're held together by people who identify with each other, and the flip side is that anyone else who has a different style is going to feel alienated and stay away.  
A means of exchange is almost the opposite of a community - it can bring people who have zero in common, and might even detest each other, to the same table.  That's one reason money is so fundamental to civilization - it gives us a way of bypassing all the messy, ridiculous social dynamics that come with collectivism.  Just lay down your cash and be on your way.  Bitcoin has this property - it has brought together businessmen, traders, communitarians, criminals, tech people, drug users, gamers, entrepreneurs, artists, etc, etc - because it is not fueled by identification, but by utility - utility that Dogecoin does not supplement. 
edit: grammar

Almost every major crash in the exchange rate has been triggered by Gox incompetence.  They are truly a cancer, baked in by the network effect, that severely impacts this currency's stability, year after year after year.

Noobs: for the love of god, stay away from mtgox!  They have screwed up royally again, and again, and again, for YEARS, and have not improved.  They are using a trading engine written in php by an amateur programmer who originally just wanted to trade magic the gathering cards. Their continued existence is a testament to the network effect (they were the first btc exchange, back when btc were 10 cents apiece and virtually unknown, and it is still amateur hour over there).
Will you be one of the "fortunate" ones who receives your btc in "only" 36 hours - or will your account be randomly frozen, locked, or drained like some of the less fortunate in this thread?  Why not just skip it and opt for a competently built platform like bitstamp with a real time trading engine?

Deflation cuts both ways.  Yes, my money could be worth more later, but just think - back in september 2011 I sold just six dollars for each bitcoin.  Now i can buy a subway sandwich for just 0.01 btc.  So for me that's like buying a 6 cent sandwich.  At some point it's hard to resist the temptation to spend as your purchasing power skyrockets.

You can pay for stuff and send people money on the internet without giving up sensitive information like your name and credit card details.  So you can participate in an economy under a pseudonym, just like you socialize with people under a pseudonym here on reddit.  It's money for the internet.

Yeah, to me it sounds like he's leaving room for ID verification by a central non-profit, ie. The Bitcoin Foundation.  I'm not reassured at all.

If you're not a high roller campbx is your best bet.
