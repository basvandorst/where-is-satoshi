Received about .25 BTC in changetips.  Bought the rest using money that wasn't doing much in the stock market.

Since nobody really addressed your original question:
Yes, gambling sites typically generate new addresses for deposits, but once you send the money there, they typically empty it out and put it into their "hot wallet".  Similarly, when you withdraw funds from a gambling site, the money comes from a hot wallet. Coinbase can easily detect if you are using a gambling site because they have a database of these hot wallets.  (They probably have people internally who send money to all the gambling sites to see what the hot wallet addresses are).

I believe hive supports litecoin.  But you should stop wasting your time with shitcoins.

Not all investments are on a rising trend.  And baseline is not inception.

I make a new reddit account every 2 or 3 weeks.  No affiliation.  
Edit: I see that it is your life's passion to look at people's post history and point out how old their accounts are.

I wasn't aware that right wing gun nut pussies traded bitcoin.

It already exists.  Multisig wallets.

I've heard nothing but bad things about Xapo.

I can't wait for openbazaar so I can stop using PayPal once and for all.

The guy partnered with Xapo, which is your first sign that he's not a very smart person.

Not sure what you're asking, but all bitcoin transactions are stored in a public ledger called the block chain.

I asked my dog and he confirmed as well.

Precisely. It's not exactly easy for a gambling site to accomplish this though.  They would need their own built-in coin mixer that obfuscates the source of the coins. If a gambling site did this, they could market it as "Coinbase-safe" and draw a lot of users.

Sounds like you know the answer already.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:54:22
Lol, you mean the same pattern we have seen dozens of times before?
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:05:51
Which would defeat the purpose of creating a new account every few weeks to maintain privacy.

I beg to differ.  I think that merchants who adopt bitcoin, like Amagi, deserve the recognition because of what they are doing to support the bitcoin ecosystem. I am aware of them because of the AMA they did a few months back.  You probably heard of them long before that because you sit at your computer all day reading r/bitcoin.  But there are countless other redditors who are new here, who want to learn about bitcoin.  I am spreading the word.  If you dont like it, throw me a downvote and move on.

Gun toting homebrewer?  I can read you like a book, son.
Use a fucking exchange.

Johnny, what's the temperature like between Xapo and all of the venture capitalists?  Are they pissed off that you guys started off on the wrong foot, have an abysmal reputation, and continue to make the wrong moves?  What happens to everyone's wallets when you guys burn through the funds and lose investors?

He is saying that BTC was highly overvalued in 2014, primarily due to manipulation.  BTC is still on a rising trend in the long run.
You should smoke a bowl or something. Relax. This isn't a technical analysis like the crazy folks over at r/bitcoinmarkets.  It's just a simple observation.
