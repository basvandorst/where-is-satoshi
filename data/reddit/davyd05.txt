What the op seems to be saying is he'd rather pay more for a product or service, because pay pal and cc's will front the initial wait time due to their overwhelmingly evil fee structures which have been dialed back a bit by governments etc as of late.
Or likes an included fee in the price that covers both currency conversions etc and such instead of waiting .. for 6 confirmation aka 1 hr IMO I dunno where were getting this 6 hr wait business. I didn't experience that at all when I bought my Trezor months ago.

1. That is 100% illegal and if they do it I hope they rot in Jail, cause its more likely they'll enforce what they never enforce on fiat financial criminals on these guys
2. If there are no bitcoins.. and they're just trading place holder in their accounts, then there is no real bitcoin for them to buy. 
( blockchain.info blog statement relates to this in the sence that they claim that they dont control your priv keys hence thought you wallet is with them, they can't move your coins for you)

Its the risk of what the 19% unknown hashing power is owned by, also that if they hit 51% and were hacked it creates problems that have large ramifications. 
Perhaps soon we wont have to worry about 51% attacks but for now its safer to just spread the hashing power out minimize pool hacks attacks.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:32:27
No offense but that is equivalent to saying the car doesn't turn on when I turn the key.
From my experience with miners, and setting up .conf files or .bat files, when they are not properly configured the command prompt window just flashes by. 
Therefore something in the conf. or bat. files or whatever setting/file you edit to customize to find your miner is not configured correctly.

that has happened a couple times already and recently
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:07:10
nope.. they're not losing money.. cause the price is rising lol had it not they probably wouldn't have had enough time to ROI on the recent round of miners. 
In the end it was still easier to speculate in October then become a miner.
Not everyone is making money but they speculate with further price rise perhaps running at a lost is worth it for some time frame. Also they add to network stability.

simply put wider spread understanding of bitcoin, right no bull scream to the moon. Bears scream whatever fud. However the price should be secondary to the utility bitcoin will provide to society. 
In other words ONLY TIME, kinda like a hangover :D

Well, they could and at the least they do put it in a mysterious enough fashion that some viewers will be checking it out. 
It would've fit better in a show like Fringe perhaps a technical representation that is.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:36:44
I don't mind this many post and threads to be honest.. it needs to get seen and burned into the minds of people. It would be safer if they had only 24% at best. 
I think out of all of this new and old pool operators and such will be motivated to perhaps provided innovations to keep the hash rate de centralized. 
Also the developers of the coin itself and miner programs.

The last two episodes and possibly before that have bitcoin references. The Jan 6th episode has a scene where the partner android is asked to scan a "bitcoin" (usb flash drive is what it looks like they used) and replies that there is $427,000 on it :D *** Minor SPOILER for fans of the show *** the $427,000 was loaded on to it at a bank by a poor soul who had a bomb strapped to his head.
Though they don't speculate on the price at least in the future potrayed by T.V bitcoin is the best way to transfer money!
@_date: 2014-12-30 12:51:16
sorry dunno any that pay , most give cashback and won't cover the included fees in prices etc.. but w/e I am sure I'm missing something.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:58:38
Only thing I can agree about is the fee's are too high, but impart that is because they to have low volume but they should start to think about competing with rates offered by other Canadian exchanges

It's like going to an ATM withdrawing cash from ur cc ( incurring the fee ) and then buying bitcoin, this is just a streamlined process...beats the $5.00 foreign currency exchange fee CIBC would hit you with for depositing $25.00usd (being a Canuck) to Pokerstars...it hurts when you miss those fee's.

this is a proactive step by them, at the least there allowing you to point hashing power you bought anywhere you want which I would agree should be inherent.

guess it being above 800 isn't high enough for you...it will raise stupid fast when general adoption occurs and if. You should just be glad you have a chance to earn fiat, and swap it to bitcoin before the adoption phase.
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:42:22
I see it as both intermediary tx system, a public ledger, a bank for the globe by the globe (as long as we get proper diversification hopefully through moments like these bear markets and crashes) there are only going to be 21 million btc what is the amount you'd like to have when it is full saturated is the question killing the average investor. I believe currently most investors of a longterm and or bullish nature believe we've yet to scratch the surface of a decent sized user base. This is where I believe to the moon derives it cultists ( I've practiced it). But bears and some of my friends who don't follow closely think people are stepping away from bitcoin...I personally think more and more are being pulled in and with price drops re think about stickign a toe in the market. 
So really relative to your budgets is what your willing to commit to help it find its value and others see how it functions. It's current value is skewed by the range of price paid, which will average out of a long time hence I am sure "hodlers' want to think in 2+ or at least 5yr time frames.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:38:58
gabblox your looking at the 4 day time frame I believe
either way we gotta discourage and hope people swap over ..the newest miners should be driven by the incentive of ROI if the market de stablizes and also the continues wealth it creates for them when it grows :D

I guess so but it was the vehicle for the transfer of usd, I don't think they depict it dead on for what crypto is but the idea that your wallet is a bitcoin, and it is somewhat suggested when he scans it that it could have any type of currency on it, but the bitcoin is what held or protected it. I'll let them have artistic license with it :D

It still has great potential our issue is global exchange access with quick fiat in and out processing. But a monopoly held by banks mean they get the best of the deal and won't just roll over and give up market share. 
However let's get real adapt or be left behind as infrastructure ramps up this process will be easier.. perhaps even companies facilitating exchanges will be able to protect against price volatility.
The future remains bright. Innovation to the rescue.

McDonalds sells cheap hamburgers
random local restaurant sells relatively cheap hamburgers
you are the person who supports a corporate vampire sucking money and wealth out of your society just saying.
just so you know generally its volume of sales that allows them to be able to charge less. Them being corporations like walmart amazon mcdonalds etc. economies of scales and well the fact walmart can be the sole demand in some areas gives them advantage when telling the producers or manufactures the price they'll pay.
I don't boycott any of these places but I also don't use them solely.

I use to think they we're ripping us off, but perhaps they use this money to keep the exchange safe, and or help them deal with the Canadian government.

You need to ask them why they don't want a share of the pie. As far as I know signing up for Bitpay or Coinbase ( offering btc payment methods but not holding the coins ) has so far in the case of Overstock and Tigerdirect boosted web traffic at the least if not generate many new sales and possible future sales. 
The idea of not having to worry about direct credit card fraud or charge back disputes.
As soon as the coins are in the hot wallet from a bitcoin sale they can be swapped for for fiat via whomever is the btc processor they choose, which I believe is quicker than regular credit card processing.

No excuse for being a douche bag to a lady, perhaps jaded memories of the girls they found attractive during high school knowing nothing about things that interested these boys...jog forward in to the future, apply same standards learned from tween girls to a adult women. Add the smugness of the guys acting like they are early adopters whether it be true or not and we have a perfect shit storm for the human instinct to breed jumping out.

6 hours to wait for confirmations can be an issue for some. It was just a rough outline to what I see. I see the majority of people hoarding, if bitcoins become worth 5 digit prices I'd assumed people would use a quicker to confirm crypto to do quick purchases, ex. gas and coffee on the go.

I alluded to this somewhere on bitcointalk but I think the endgame of this movement is to no longer have to reinvest BTC in to FIAT...the systems are broken, fees out the ass on every corner.
Eventually if we have system set up to buy and sell with btc no one who trully understands crypto currency is going to be transferring bitcoin back to made to fail fiat currencies.
I also think it would be likely to see Bitcoin as the "gold standard" of crypto and people spending Litecoin or a better suited altcoin for daily or frequent purchases.

I checked it out.. its a toss up. The current book orders are way off, or so inflated the fee's of Virtex are swallowed easily.
As a Canadian you have to swap the money to USD ( At the moment) which I think is more then a flat $5 bucks on a bill payment at CaVirtEx 
I do give it to them on layout, style but there not saving you money to justify buying here besides maybe on when you expect a quick swing and want to get in...they seem to be quicker.

Buy $20000 / $32/btc = 625btc
Sell 625btc * $2 = $1250
Buy $20000 / $1200/btc = 16.67btc
Sell 16.67btc * $450 = $7500
can you see from these numbers it is actually less volatile then it was in the past?
