I think he's doing the compound interest calculations as the deposits would've happened over 40 years. Hence getting to $1.9 million and then getting the $95k annual payout. If it was $600k lump sum it would be worth about $4.5 million after 40 years.

Services like Venmo will not always be free. Eventually they will have to find ways to make money. It's fine to be free when you are trying to get market share and have VC money. Whether it is selling user information, charging fees to users and/or merchants they will.

If you're younger with a lot less money and more time to recover from your losses I would be dumping all extra money into crypto with a 50/40/10 split between btc/eth and then some smaller coins, or 50/50. I'd slow down when btc hits $15k. Then start slowly switching my investments to something closer like 5% being crypto and the rest going to more traditional investments.

Of course. Bitcoin is going to hit $20k again. Easily. And, soon. Anything under $20k seems like a no brainer as long as it is also money I'm willing to lose.

To be fair, I got approximately $20 worth of BTC in in 2011, it's now worth about $17,000. I'll be happy if the $1,000 worth I've bought over the past 2 years sees 1/2 that growth in 8 years.

Hold on, you can deposit USD on regular Coinbase then transfer it to your pro account to avoid buying fees on BTC?

$100 is a small transaction when you realize there are billions moving on the main chain every day.

I'm pretty sure the institutional money is buying smaller cheaper blocks as well as larger ones when they become available. They buy what is available. You can tell institutional money is making a push because there are large accounts that keep growing. I don't remember the exact numbers. In 2017 wallets with 1k+ coins was only about 20% of circulating Bitcoin and now it is at 26%.
Obviously big transactions are probably institutions but their not going to pass up small buys if that is what's available.

I've bought a little bit of ETH and Litecoin after BTC crashed last year. ETH is still down and Litecoin is about break even. Meanwhile, all of my BTC purchases are now up. BTC is the safest bet.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:03:54
No joke. All I see when I look at my buy transaction history are missed opportunities to be up even more. I'm still up but I'm a little disappointed that I started to ease up on my buying when Bitcoin was around $4k.
However, once I can start spending my crypto more easily I expect my buying to ramp up a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:49:37

Assuming that 16m still keeps entering the system. I suspect a lot of people that aren't bored of BTC will start selling. Right now more people are buying because of hype and because it's easier thanks to apps like Robin hood and CashApp.
Bitcoin will easily grow past $20k, probably even $50k, and all of us buying now will see a good ROI. However, seeing 200 times your investment is likely gone.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:40:53
A bit curious about it myself. My phone had an alert come through. It already rebounded about $900. Must be a really big sell.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:09:40
If I just bought it's going down. If I wait to buy it's going up.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:09:10
It is probably a combination of things. I feel Coinbase introducing automatic buying helped stabilize BTC a bit. Then you had Facebook announce Libra and all the press that got. So, people see Facebook, a major company, coming up with their own "Bitcoin". The talking heads can't help but mention Bitcoin when talking about Libra. People see that BTC has been on a steady climb since April and it hit 20k before so it seems like a good value.
People start to buy and the price keeps going up. People see the price going up and they want to get in before it peaks. 
Bitcoin also seems to increase in price when there is times of financial uncertainty. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff happening between the US and Iran. Bitcoin allows for countries with sanctions to pay and be paid outside of sanctions. I wouldn't be surprised if there are some rich people using it for business. That would also increase demand.

$3.79/gal is a little high but about right for Socal. Having $1.50 in taxes per gallon raises the price even though it was sold to the public as not having an impact on the price.

I was noticing it last night as BTC was nearing $12k. The sell offs just didn't has as dramatic effect and weren't as large.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:54:42
I feel the same way. I did some bigger buys but then I would wait longer to buy again. Now I feel like this is the new bottom.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:53:51
Probably, it might have gotten higher. Maybe it could have kept growing and caused more hype causing more growth. The price is set by the amount of available bitcoin and the desire to have it.
Some people look at how much new BTC is being mined, how much it's current value is and how much money must be spent to keep up with that bitcoin purchasing. If the amount that was spent recently is way lower than what is needed to purchase the all new Bitcoin then the price is too high. It's not perfect but it definitely let's you gauge things.

It's always a possibility. Generally it's against the communities best interest to steal or create a theft backdoor because that would quickly make bitcoin worthless.
I would be more worried about a government or someone interested in making bitcoin fail creating an issue that devalues bitcoin. What ever was created would have to be very sophisticated to avoid detection and the review process. That would require a lot of wealthy and a trusted contributer being corrupted. Those are not very easy things to do.
Overall, it's highly unlikely and even if it did happen it would probably be fixed quickly. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:31:15
People would argue but I think if you encrypt, and it's decent, then it's fine. If you had a substantial amount of money in bitcoin I'd probably pay and use a backup service like Carbonite, Crash Plan, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:48:30
While I'm more optimistic long term this is pretty common with gambling. It wasn't that long ago that you could profitably bet on horses. Then the Government found out so they ruined it. This is pretty common. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:45:46
They stopped buying and selling on their site. Although I never had a problem converting my coins to cash so I don't know what caused that.
Circle basically allowed people to buy with credit cards. They ate any charge backs. So they just stopped buying and selling.
I think they always said they were still planning on doing something more with cryptocurrency. They never said what though. I was starting to assume a new coin or a backend internal blockchain for their transfers. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:10:10
Well you have many eyes going over the code and a lot of people are aware of what shouldn't be there. A failed attempt would result in a devastating being blacklisted. There would likely be multiple failed attempts before a successful one. You would need multiple reviews to fail and corruption of respected developers for it to happen. It's not impossible but highly improbable that it would happen.
I would be more worried about a silly bug causing problems. Any major entity trying to destroy bitcoin would probably be more invested in less obvious methods. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:26:00

I've been buying little bits every dip. Nothing too crazy. I'm still holding onto some cash at the chance of a bigger dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:28:44
Pretty much. A lot of people are seeing risk and all I can see is the reward for hanging on and buying more. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:39:59
By the end of its journey it will be fine as a currency. Right now there is a lot of speculative investments by people that don't understand what they are getting but don't want to miss out. A lot of scared money.
 There are a ton of traders. I know a guy who dropped $500 after the crash and has bots trading for him and he claims he's averaging about $25 a day but I haven't talked to him in about 1 month.
Meanwhile, it's a fine currency for small transactions. It works great for money transfers less than $5,000, particularly international ones. You can see the major banks fighting back with things like Zelle.
It kind of makes sense to think of it as a commodity but I've never used a commodity like I use Btc. Of course, maybe I was using my commodities incorrectly. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:58:49
I'm definitely in the $100k camp. Maybe not in a year or maybe even 2 but sooner than later. I've been buying throughout the dip. I was a little bummed it didn't drop lower. I was prepared to buy more. I also buy and use bitcoin for purchases when I can. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:49:33
Not enough dips. I'm literally sitting on money I want to through into cryptocurrency if you consider my debit card as my bank account, but I want it cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:42:03
So far I've purchased BTC in May of 2011, January of 2014 and late last year. Each time the previously purchased BTC was at least 100x its purchased price. In about 3 years!
Now, I'm about to make a more serious investment. So... That probably means BTC is going to tank hardcore back down below the original purchase. However, there is still plenty of room for growth.
Today I transferred some money to someone and it was done in seconds and the fee was pennies. Even yesterday I did 2 large transactions and they were quick. Now that transactions are cheap and quick I expect a lot more good things. All that is really needed for it to be a reliable and easy to use currency is increased acceptance and decreased volatility. The price will have to increase significantly if it becomes commonly accepted and decrease volatility.
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:49:56
Steam had a very valid statement when they stopped. It's less valid now. 
Basically, large fees and fee fluctuations, extreme volatility in pricing and long transaction times. Most of this has been improved recently. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:34:32
I'd rather have lower fees so I can actually use my bitcoin than a high price. Now it just needs to stabilize. Bitcoin isn't about being a good investment for your portfolio, it was designed to be a replacement digital currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:47:22
Ugh, I just want to say that I have coins stored in a wallet that would fall under your zombie address. This could amount to stealing if it were successful. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:38:55
I'd add to the already good points. Money transfers (especially large ones) are cheap ways to transfer money internationally. If you are a selling there is no charge back process. Having multiple wallets can be useful and it is easy so segregating your money is easy.
Most important to me is that you would not be at the mercy of the banks. All transactions are regulated by an algorithm with very strict rules. There are no real surprises.
Also, it's basically private. You won't have someone collecting data on you without your knowledge.

The 600% increase was the byproduct of bitcoin being over-hyped because of some good news. Now it's correcting. Since then Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has gotten stronger. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty. Bitcoin and crypto has always been very volatile.
 You're not too late to start investing. Many, like myself, believe there is a very bright future for cryptocurrency and that Bitcoin is the best / strongest one. If you just want to get started join an exchange and buy a small amount. Be prepared to lose it all or have it significantly devalued.
If the wildest predictions are true a small $25 portion of crypto could be worth thousands in a couple years. If it loses all value then it was only $25.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:20:24
God, I hope none of that is true. This has likely been going down, will go down and stay depressed for awhile. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:23:24
The real way the get greater bitcoin adoption will be to get all the machines that accept Apple pay and Google pay to get a bitcoin/lightning version. 
The other problem is still things like returns. Especially with how volatile BTC is. If some pays with BTC and it dips you won't want to give the cash for a return and if it spikes you won't want to give them BTC. So all bitcoin sales would only be for store credit or final. We might be smart and understanding of such a policy but as adoption increases so does stupid customers.

Net worth can be a shitty estimate. Most people's net worth is built upon over generations. I've built 3 successful businesses for little money and a 4th for myself. My net worth isn't awful but not great or nearly as great as the people whose businesses I built. I also didn't build their businesses alone but after the financing my input was the main reason for their success and why my departure has stagnated their growth.
Money really is the most important thing to building a successful business. The second part is to constantly be looking for opportunities to pay someone else to do the work you tell them to do. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:01:57
I use it to purchase. Of course, I primarily use it for gambling. I'll pick up some gift cards on occasion. I also use it to transfer money. I would prefer it as a currency.
The only reason it isn't used as a currency is lack of overall acceptance. If I could use it the same way I used Android Pay but even more widely accepted I would drop my bank accounts. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:54:17
I almost did. When I saw the price I went to back out to buy more and after adding some more money it shot up $100. Then I figured I'd try and hold out a little longer. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:07:05
Yeah, I bought $4000 yesterday and then sold it at a small profit. I then sold a lot today.
I'm not an expert. However, your in about the area. I was thinking for current value but on the very low side. I have a bot set to buy everything I sold and then some before it hits 1K.
Unfortunately cryptocurrency got over hyped. I don't think it's weird to think that 1 Btc could be worth $50k it's just not going to be in 2018 or 2019.
All that said, the fad has increased adoption of Bitcoin for the most part. This correction will also reduce volatility. Personally, I feel the volatility is the last serious issue Btc needs to overcome. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:34:14
Yeah, I bought a couple in 2011 for $20.00 minus about $1.50 transfer fee. It was so inconvenient to use and such an inconsequential amount of money I just let them sit. I know I have the info for them somewhere and I'm looking but I'm in no hurry to sell them. My only regret is not selling them at the peak and then buying more at the dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:32:29
I've been buying small amounts as it dips. I'm trying to time a lump buy when it hits bottom. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:52:49
It might.
I think it is better to expect it to keep bouncing between 7k and 10k for the next few months until it settles in summer. O certainly it calms for a bit it will probably shoot up higher than $20k again. Assuming nothing completely damning happens.
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert.

I use Coinbase or I transfer to Venmo or Circle then send it to my account. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:51:56
Honestly, for me it is primarily online casinos and card rooms. If I see a place accepts it I'll buy something with it. Once Steam stopped accepting bitcoin then I stopped using it there.
Occasionally I'll use to transfer money to someone but services like Zelle and Venmo have really taken over.
Also, I've tipped bitcoin at a place when they printed their QR code for bitcoin. They said I was probably the first person to use it and it was gone when I went back.

Synology is a hardware NAS with really nice software. It is quite nice and very customizable. You can also have cloud like functionality and even have virtual workstation like desktops you can log into. If you had that you wouldn't want another PC to be a server for storage.
You could setup Synology's software to back up as much or as little of as many devices as you want. 
You could also build your own NAS and there is plenty of software that you could use to get nearly the same functionality. 
There are also lesser devices like the Western Digital My Cloud line that could be used. 
You can backup from anywhere with those setups over the internet or your local network. You'd basically be running a private Dropbox from home. 
If the devices lost support you would still have them and could use them. The problem is you would still be responsible for the security of both whether they are supported or not.
That is why I say it's better to just pay for a quality backup service like Carbonite or Crash Plan. They encrypt your information on their end. They also have revisionis built in and they're information is stored far away from you. You could also just have their service backup you NAS.

Maybe I'm missing something. I'm not sure much has changed but the price has dropped below $10k. As it stands I'm not sure there isn't much for a quick rebound design above $10k and so far it looks like it is improving.
While the bitfinex and thether fraud is a concern. I don't see anything immediate happening. SEC comments are just that for now.

If they're blowing it all on cryptocurrency then they're dumb. However, buying a bit now could be nice for after graduation. I've always thought that if you're taking out a student loan then getting the bare minimum and starting a little business is a good idea. Why not also invest a little in cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:24:00
Agreed. I was given .0162 bitcoin at CES by Circle. 5 other people were there with me, they all got the bitcoin and transfered to me. I had all but forgotten about them. I was more focused on finding a wallet that had $50 I purchased in 2011 along with a wallet that had some coin I mined when I stumbled upon them. It was $1,500 after I sold them in the dip.
I was convinced bitcoin was worthless in 2011 when I couldn't get my coins to do what I wanted. When I was handed about $20 worth of btc I looked at it as a goof.
Since finding my bitcoin it's been easy (by comparison) to use. Buying, selling and transferring it into my bank account is easy. Now the fees are cheap. My only fear is that with its new high profile it gets regulated to death. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:26:50
It's a medium to high risk and medium to high reward investment. It should be a small portion of investments.
Its perfectly fine to invest a little more now if you already have some 'stable' investments. But yeah, it's likely still going down from here and not going way up anytime too soon. Might as well find other areas to invest until it starts to go up again. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 01:11:53
Crypto is still highly speculative. You're talking about putting a large sum of money into something that could easily half the total amount. Student loan money is a very cheap loan and its not the worst thing you could do but spreading it into something like a side business that can generate revenue would be better because you'll learn more and have something to show/experience if crypto doesn't live up to the hype. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:59:01
Is there data to make you think this or is it more of a gut feeling?
I see this drop slowing at about $6.5k and maybe dipping below $6k. It may drop again afterwards but I'd imagine another rise up to about $8-9k before that happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:06:20
People are buying and selling for a lot of reasons. 
The stock market was on a rally today. A lot of uncertainty. A lot of people bought not knowing what they were getting. Paying taxes. Exchanges are going to start allowing more coins. Illicit purchases are moving over to other cryptocurrencies. We'll see how it goes. 
March has been a bad month for bitcoin always. Either you believe in bitcoin's possibilities or you don't.
Don't blow money you can't afford to lose but maybe skimp on some luxury items and buy a little. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:37:34
Yeah, but you want it somewhere that isn't going to be damaged with your computer etc. You could even get a cheap server and use that.
Personally, I pay for a Carbonite backup for all my devices and I have a Synology setup.
Also, you have to worry about the security of your Nas. I've done work where people have WD Cloud drives or Synology devices that were hacked and then doing things like running seed boxes or mining cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:13:53
That is where I would guess this drop stops before it goes up again. There may be another drop after but BTC isn't going to just plummet to less than $5,000.

I haven't reviewed how it is being done so maybe I'm wrong.
I imagine something like Stegonography is being used. Basically, when you store values you reserve an amount of space like 32, 64, or 128 bits and most data is actually built from multiple of these chunks. Well, some data chunks don't always require the full allocation of data. You can write additional data in those spaces. It's like writing information in the white space of paragraphs in a book.
The computer also doesn't display this information because it sees that the paragraph ends and instead of looking for new information to display it looks for the beginning of a paragraph before it writes back to the screen. 
Now, lets say you filled the white space with another story. That would be where these images are being hidden. Instead a program looks only at the whitespace and only displays the area between the end and begging of paragraphs and not the beginning and end.

Btc is overly inflated and overly filled with investors. It's not worthless. A lot has gone on in the last 7 months so it is more valuable than it was a year ago but still overvalued because investing in it become a trend. I have no idea where the bottom is but it's not $0. Hang tight it will rebound.

Not going to happy. Asian markets are starting to buy pretty heavy and only increasing. US banks and investment groups are working on investment options and we'll start to probably see those coming into play by the end of the year. Buy em' while they're cheap.

I'd say $6k is a pretty stable long term value as long as no major bombshells are dropped on bitcoin. Right now it's on a 2 step forward and 1 step back increase in value. Everything is building to 2020 in my opinion. The Olympics in Japan will make or break bitcoin, in my opinion.

Yeah, I was pretty happy. I bought $500 on Sunday with the plan to sell the principal yesterday but I decided to hold out another day. I sold a little bit ago and am happy to have made some bitcoin.

Hahaha, for a currency to come this far in 10 years with no Government, or large entity, backing it. Bitcoin is very impressive. It's barely scratched the surface of mainstream consciousness. If anything this last year is the real beginning for real world adoption.

I seriously doubt we are at the bottom. People are expressing a lot of negativity. Those people are hanging on the crying investments and unless some new money enters bitcoin then they'll keep losing faith and selling. Just buy what you can afford on these dips if you think Bitcoins future is brighter than right now.

Not really. You only really want it there while you trade. However, a few hundred dollars isn't going to be a high priority wallet.

I usually do but as it kept climbing and I saw a news report I thought, "This is it. My last chance for &lt; 10k BTC for the rest of the year. Now I look like a fool.

Well, I bought a few coins in May of 2011 for an inaccessible online poker account with a few hundred dollars in it. BTC was trading around $15 a coin at the time. I forgot about them. I was also given about 8 bucks worth, .01693881 btc to be exact, in 2005. I found them back in February after the crash. I've sold and rebought some since then.
Overall, I guess about $18,800 if I cashed it all out now. So, I guess I've made about $18,400 over 7 years. Although, I probably just lost $400 while typing this. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:53:10
It's worth more today than it was a year ago. I guess it depends on where you start measuring.

Are any of these actually worthwhile for the users or are they scams? I was under the impression most browser bitcoin mining was done without the knowledge of the person who installed the extensions. Otherwise it was usually worthless to a normal person.

I was waiting for a dip for about a week and half. Gave in yesterday and bought at peak. Almost instantly it started dropping. So, to the dip buyers. You're welcome.

I still want filthy casuals in here with us. If anything institutional money is about to enter in. This slump is the calm before the storm. The big money is holding out sitting on the sidelines waiting to pounce on the next upswing.

You're ignoring the mechanisms which have allowed those services to explode. Specifically funding of a larger backer and the ability to lose large sums of money to increase their market share. If anything Bitcoin has grown in spite of those things and with downward pressure from those entities. Bitcoin isn't a trendy new app, or a new flavor of Coke it's a bottom up grassroots movement that shakes the foundation of the existing powers of banks and government. It couldn't grow at anything but a slow pace.
If Bitcoin could've paid its way into grocery stores, retail outlets, big box chains, and given away millions of dollars in free money plus had a flashy app to make it all easy it would have the market share of those other services. There just isn't anyone throwing that money around in the name of bitcoin. The only money you'll find getting invested is to try and take advantage of all the opportunities that it's future could hold. 
Even things like Apple or Android Pay took time to be adopted and haven't fully been adopted. While Bitcoin is still primarily a blackmarket currency it is still one of the best ways to make international money transfers. Of course, now banks are trying to push alternatives that are currently free to use so they don't lose that business and can hopefully charge for it later. There are plenty of place that accept bitcoin as payment but you have to make an effort to find them.
It is very volatile. It makes it great for trading and it has a lot of potential so it's probably a good long term investment. So far it has been incredibly secure which is pretty astonishing. It will stabilize as it's liquidity and adoption increases. Stabilization will increase exponentially with adoption.
Until then, yeah it's got somethings it need s to work out but it's getting done and solutions are presenting themselves faster.

Those people are idiots. The shock of the correction has people nervous. It's highly. Improbable. 2018 is going to be a very slow year. I hope it is. I want more cheap coin. 
2019 may be good but 2020 is really where I think we see Bitcoin take off. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:47:15
Almost certainly. I haven't used it yet but I downloaded it immediately upon hearing about. It.

I used to play online poker to pay my bills. It had been under attack by the US Gov't for awhile. Depositing and withdrawing funds had become inconvenient so I would keep a decent amount of money online. April 15th 2011 the US Justice Department basically seized all the money on these sites.
I had already heard about Bitcoin at the time but wasn't very familiar with it. I also had a couple dummy online poker accounts that I stored money in but the had no billing or payment information linked to them. I sold those accounts to someone for Bitcoin at a great discount.
I really got into Bitcoin for a few months. I would mine while I looked for a real job. I liked the idea of the freedom from the banks and government over my finances. I had bad experiences with both. So, I would mine and see if there were ways for me to use my Bitcoin to play poker. 
I had difficulty finding a way to cash out my bitcoins. After getting 'real' job I didn't spend as much time trying to mine. I did some lite coin mining. Overall, I had basically lost my wallet and had pretty much given up on it. 
Eventually online poker rooms started accepting bitcoin. It made my funds easily accessible. I didn't need to keep large sums of money on shady poker sites and could have my money back in my bank account in a couple days. 
I had tried to find my old coins a couple times. I didn't really try until after the ATH in December. I found them in February. While it has gone down since I found them. It's really grown my love of Bitcoin. What I thought was lost money is now worth more than some people's annual salaries.
I can't wait for the day that cryptocurrency is at least as accepted as Apple or Google pay.

$25k is very possible. I'm not sure it will hold at $25k but I would expect run ups and crashes for the next few years.

It'll probably pick up tonight. Right now the Asian markets are buying big. They go to sleep the market drops. They wake up and it rises and the western markets get excited so they keep it alive a little. Then interest peters out and the Japanese and the South Koreans wake up and start buying again. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:38:12
Did they ever give out BCH for people that had Bitcoin on their system before/during the fork? I read they were going to buy never heard anything after that. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:52:57
Banks are the problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:58:36
Known scam.

That feels more like a subtle burn on Bitcoin than a compliment. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:24:42
A possibility but highly unlikely. Adoption is picking up in Japan and South Korea at a pretty quick pace now. Western Banks are at the early stages of taking it seriously. I have an in-law who is in a pretty high position at a major bank and we talked about cryptocurrency for a bit. They didn't give any specifics but were in agreement that now is a good time to be buying and that they have been personally buying.
There are 2 caveats to this. 1.) there was a time when even the smartest people thought Enon was one of the best investments until it was awful almost over night. 2.) This in-law could hate me and have been lying.
