People have left, and are still walking out.  In a community based on debate and consensus to adapt, well that's been prevented in here.  No longer can you see the weight a comment holds to the community.  There is no proactive community filter, there is however a single entity filter that remains biasing the discussion and content in here.   There is plenty other places to discuss hot topics that don't have overbearing moderation, and the number symbolize how the general population feels about that.   I think judging the Bitcoin community on number in here is misleading.  Google trends for Bitcoin's regional interest, competitiveness for Bitcoin terms, unique visitors to Bitcoin news outlets, software downloads, transactions all give a better indication.

I might be looking at it from a different perspective, but I am seeing a group who lobbies for bitcoin at the core.  An organization such as this will always need revenue for marketing and operational costs, as well to reimburse qualified individuals to carry out the tasks effectively.  At the same time, I don't believe in any context that they should act as seniority in the community or decision wise for anything that has the potential to affect the ecosystem as a whole.     
   
At the end of the day Bitcoin already has representation by the merchants accepting it, companies providing services, ATM's and clubs, but a unified foundation that focused on marketing Bitcoin with a consistent image in regions of interest probably wouldn't be the worst step toward reaching the ideal segment effectively.

Very interested in seeing this play out.  With mining operations scaled to an extent as today, it seems as though the barriers to entry minimize the involvement of small scale operations.  How does one prevent cost effective operations from capitalizing on the removal of barriers.  Can't fathom the outcome, very glad there is qualified individuals who can think outside of the box.  Looking forward to the future.

Not sure why everything has to be extreme. Let them do their thing.  If they find a model that is sustainable it will ride.  If they cannot, they will not succeed and someone will create an organization that picks up where they left off.  Just my two bits.
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:23:27
My guess would be that peoples opinions and priorities change.  Can't hold it against them forever.  If you also thought the way you did 2 years ago, it would suggest you are not learning, and not adapting.  Things change, it's just the way it is.

Is there a good resource to learn about settlement layers?

Very cool representation!  Thanks for sharing.

This in the window of every retailer with a Bitcoin ATM.  Scale with supplies from Alibaba... Few colors, different LED &amp; LCD options, yes, yes.  I hope you keep this in motion!

Have fun! I hope you guys have some great conversations.

lol. I wonder if that's a 10 million dollar Porsche.

You could also probably make your own iPhone, the thing is, sometimes people would prefer to pay for an end product than invest time they don't have into learning how to &amp; building the final version.

Wonder if anyone can recall the sponsors in previous years, it's a brand reminder, doesn't mean the event didn't happen.  I think the lack of any data in regards to Bitcoin awareness, attendees and those who were watching on TV makes us think that it wasn't successful.
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:44:19
Happy day!
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:34:18
Bingo!  Well said, thanks for clarifying.  
@_date: 2016-01-02 22:16:08
Can't wait to read the whole thing!  Hope it comes together nicely, I am sure there will be some great points in here.  best of luck with the paper.

Was referring to the changing price of Bitcoin.

Tarnished Bitcoin? To who? The Bitcoin community? Willing to assume that not many people who don't know or use Bitcoin will ever see the video.
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:56:52
WTF YO get you very far lately?
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:36:26
Clearly you're mistaken.  Bitcoin's use has been documented the fastest growing in areas without stable financial markets.  You can see it quite easily from the public statistics provided by the remittance and merchant apps... Bitcoins a great on ramps for these people.... but hey fuck it right?   You're not talking about it, but you're responding to a comment of which that is the topic.  Amazing, I should have known you were referring to your own little bubble, my bad!!!!!  
   
You also realize that the definition of a third world country isn't "poor", right?   Because that seems to be what your suggesting but I imagine after a quick google, your tone will change to something else again.  What topic are we on now?
@_date: 2016-02-11 04:15:07
The person who made it?  You realize that someone made it, not Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:40:25
Hope you kill it! Best wishes!
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:32:14
You don't understand the points being made.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:28:06
How?  You seem to know what you're doing.  You seem to have the answers, so why not expand.  What do these videos do to enhance this sub? Do they share news?  Do they share quality information/ Insight? What is the point of them?  And how on earth, did you arrive, at it being because of your skin color.  Man, if you keep using that as a scapegoat, you're going to keep telling yourself, in your own head, that everything you're doing is perfect, and it's simply race that won't allow you to progress.... This is clearly not the case and a sure fire way to avoid learning, adapting or understanding what you can do to improve your content.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:22:11
O yeah?  What a video to share.  "Bitcoin sucks, Etherium is better, and Bitcoin needs centralization to be awesome".  How much of that shit you smoke this morning?  You're fucking nuts.  What a waste of a video taped drive and 3 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:20:53


LOL.  So, instead of correcting, or working to educate the author, instead you share on Reddit to see what response you can provoke?  You are acting so helpless, but it seems like you have the perfect answers.  If the article is misinformed, inform. Get up on this sub, and inform away Millrat.
@_date: 2016-02-09 05:13:37
I don't think that happens when people win at the casino.  And, is fair lying?
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:50:58
Cryptsy was running a scam from day one. They were taking financial incentives to bring SHITCOINS to market so developers could profit based on false assumptions and fake demand.  Cryptsy was a scam since day 1. Many people suggested cryptsy was a scam from day 1.  Many other people argued this to keep their capital flowing.  It was a matter of time from day 1.  The assertion that Cryptsy was "hacked" and not an inside job is an actually hilarious at best.      
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:45:47
Once again, speaking about circumstances you know... nothing about.  What a surprise! Nothing new in this neck of the woods.
@_date: 2016-02-11 05:19:43
I am curious how big you think the ecosystem is, or who it is that is going to be receptive of this negative message?  Do you truly believe random people come in here to look at these videos?  Nobody thinks it is anything worse than they did previous.  This video did nothing to change anyone's perception. If someone thinks Bitcoin is a Paypal knockoff, they also did previously to the video.  This isn't even close, not even a fraction of something that would be bad publicity. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:13:23
it is
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:12:56
Still following the same path!  I guess people just don't want to learn or adapt.  It's super easy.  Let me put it this way.  No matter what youdo, you are not going to be good unless you are open to advice. Clearly your head is too thick to listen to any. So,in the same fashion, you suggest that people hate black people instead of taking criticisms and considering, hmm maybe there is some substance to this.  Alright buddy, well done.   That mentality wont get you far.
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:57:38
It's not spam. It's suggestions, which you are asking for.  
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:38:08
Here's some good tips on presenting.      
I think  is dialing in your presentation skills so the audience is receptive of the information.  Andreas and a number of others in this community are great people to watch, there's a lot of truly skilled presenters in this sub.    
As for the BTC information, no shortage here.  Make sure you're touching on the benefits that offer utility to the audience, don't get hung up on a bunch of technical jargon that means nothing to them.  A lifestyle approach to how Bitcoin will tangibly enhance their personal lives, lots of examples, and of course encouragement to download a wallet and conduct transactions as you walk them through it.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:57:51
Why get defensive?  Simply pointing out the fact that you seem to stir shit up to provoke emotional responses, instead of adding value to the majority of conversations I have read.   Recount why we're having this discussion.  It has nothing to do with my credentials (which are decent) by the way.  I questioned your motivations for your original post, your response has been that I am uneducated, and a question of my credentials.  Why not just join the conversation instead of the baseless, defensive responses.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:17:26
What a great ZCASH promotion. Place yourself beside Bitcoin and wish for the best.   The fuck is this even on here.  "How Bitcoin can save us"  "What needs to be done for Bitcoin to reach fungibility" - There is 1000 positive spins an article like this could have, but I guess the Milly is here to stir shit up on the regular anyhow.  
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:41:49
If you are confused about finance on a global level, yes, your comment.  When you realize $50 USD is a good month of work in some parts of the world, yes, you probably would not suggest that.  Have a good day in your bubble.
@_date: 2016-02-21 22:04:06
You're not going to earn many buddies by tossing a race card.  No, people don't like your spam.  People don't agree with your point of view. Happens every day.  Happens every day to everyone.  Black, yellow, white, grey, purple, pokadotted.  People have opinions, others don't agree. Fail to sympathize with opinions, and SPAM reddit to try and get hits, now that might be what people downvote you for (noway right??).  Has NOTHING to do with race.  Has everything to do with your videos suggesting 1. Centralization is the only way for Bitcoin to thrive 2. Etherium is better.  You make this content, and you spam it in r/bitcoin.  What the fuck, honestly, do you expect? Suggesting skin color has, ANYTHING to do with people not agreeing with your point of view is ridiculous at best.   TELL ME: What value has your videos brought to the Bitcoin ecosystem?  Have you potrayed a lifestyle, added educational tools, or ANYTHING that ANYONE would deem useful content to take time out of their day to watch?  Does sharing etherium videos, and ideas about how centralization is Bitcoin's destiny REALLY enhanced this sub at all?  Please, enlighten.
