Ah, in the same way people are mining Earth for Pokemon.

I don't think I understand memes or bitcoin.

I hear you. I will be interested in bitcoin when it is used as a currency, I don't really care about it as an investment commodity.

I think that "Average Joe" will think this is a scam, or some sort of malware.  I would be very hesitant to visit some website I wasn't familiar with.  Religious groups also sometimes use this method to trick people into reading propaganda.  Just saying, don't be surprised if people end up throwing the coupons away and thinking you're a jerk.

In college, I applied for a credit card in exchange for a Subway Sandwich.  I regret it to this day.

Sure or a burger or shoes.

I have never seen a place where I could spend a bitcoin. There is the occasional Bitcoin ATM in the major cities, but it seems like the consensus is: Bitcoin is a commodity to invest in, and can be bought/sold for "real" money. 
I'm still holding out hope, but we're still not close to a point where I can consider it a currency. It's frustrating to me.

Also, IMO, if you have a currency you should to be able to spend it to buy things.

Careful, someone might bring up espionage or election manipulation
@_date: 2019-12-27 03:03:46
...In that...it's not realistic to expect either one?
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:36:05
Does anyone still try to use it as a currency, or is it only an investment commodity now? Seems like the posts on how to spend it have decreased to nearly none.
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:03:39
Nice! What are you gonna spend it on?

To me, a unicorn is a mythical creature that is imagined to have great power, but doesn't actually exist. Also it has a huge weird fanbase. Is that what he meant here?
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:24:34
Yeah you can invest in that. Also some people use gold to make circuits and helmets and jewelry.

Well, it's dangerous and insecure to update your browsers, better to stick with what has always worked. /s

I assume they are talking about how easy it is to "spend" the currency. In which case, I applaud the effort.
The main reason I've never bought bitcoins is because I've never seen a place to spend them. Bitcoins are an investment commodity way more than they are a currency.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:54:44
So, you are arguing that bitcoin is not a currency (I agree)

ITT I've lost track of who is trying to discredit whom.
