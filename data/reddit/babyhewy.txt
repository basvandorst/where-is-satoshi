I just want to buy bitcoins easily, the process is so frustrating... There is not much support in this market which is why I imagine the price fluctuates so much.  It seems so easy for money to just disappear in the land of bitcoin and that is a major downside.  Meanwhile the price fluctuates while I wait for support to resolve my issue...

I just tried to transfer from dwolla to gox and I'm having the same problem, still no word back from support and I have no idea where my money is

I will have to try that next time.  Problem is my money is lost... I transferred it from gox to dwolla via bitinstant and it got lost in transition. So unfortunately I no longer have funds to even buy coins until this is resolved.

When will transfers from dwolla be available?

More specifically- what can I do to turn these dollars in my dwolla account into bitcoins asap?

That doesn't help as my funds are waiting on dwolla still, but thanks anyway.
Tried messaging u/bitinstant but have gotten no response on the matter.

Wow that was fast.  Awesome thanks so much!

Please come up with a better phrase...

I'm assuming I have to get verified first?
