I have a cryptosteel but I am not a fan of it. Its hard to open sometimes, the rivet binds, you need a screwdriver to get the end cap opened, and the letters aren't always legible. The letters also don't come in a permanent container so now they are all mixed up in a Ziploc bag...
I pre-ordered a Steely ( after meeting them at the Denver Day for Crypto conference. The letters are laser engraved so they are very easy to read, the letter s slide into the device with no issues and you do not need any tools to set it up. They also offer custom engraving, so you can add some custom artwork. The letters also come in reusable plastic containers to help keep everything organized. That link has a discount code they had at the conference so hopefully, it works so you can save $10

Some of the best advice I was given when I got into crypto was: Be your own bank! Educate yourself and use best practices to reduce your risk. 
It’s best to minimize attack vectors on your crypto by storing them in a hardware wallet like a KeepKey or Ledger and to use something durable like a Steely Cold Wallet( to backup the recovery / mnemonic phrase.

I am just sharing my experience about the cryptosteel and will plan on sharing my experience on the Steely.
I'm glad that your unit is working fine and I might reach out to their support team to see if this is a manufacturing issue for my unit.








I agree about the pricing, and I hope that these can become more affordable. I would also like to see them bundled with some hardware wallets.

����make sure you back up your TREZOR with something like a Steely (

You can check out  they make something similar to the cryptosteel. I met the owner at a crypto conference about a month ago and got to see their prototype.
