I made a small investment in bitcoin. After reading this thread I heard that there is a chance that it will go to 17k then dip to about 13k-15k. Do you think that I should pull out all of my investment at 17k then reinvest it again when the price goes to about 13k-14k?
Sorry I'm new at this.

But on the bright side if ever you pulled out your investment at 11% you really didn't lose anything (Except for the opportunity to get higher amount of money). Your investment should have already accumulated interest from it. Just wait for the sudden dip and reinvest again.
Just my 2 cents
But I do think doing this kind of technique is better.... Gonna try this once it hits 13-14k

I'm actually waiting for the price to hit it's highest point so that I can pull out my investment then wait for it dip down to atleast 13-14k so that I can reinvest it. But I've been monitoring it since the sudden price hike and it has been weirdly stable at 16k+ until now.

I'm just making educated guesses that it will be at its highest point basing on the graphs fluctuation. I've been watching it fluctuate since the price hike and it has been as high as 16,773.04 after that it went down again and never went up to that amount. Of course my method isn't safe because there is still a possibility of it going up and exceeding the said amount. Which is an opportunity lost to people who pulled out early.
