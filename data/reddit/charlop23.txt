Bitcoin has indeed been on rising stride lately hitting a high of over $13,500. This is remarkably high owing to the fact that the bearish trend has cropped into the market for over a year now. I'm still confident of altcoin, and peculiarly an altcoin like XDMC, whose project has been trending on the partnership secured with IBM and WIZZLE. The project happens to be on an IEO lately on OOOBTC and PROBIT Exchange where the tokens is going for 6 cents with up to 30% discount and other incentives.

That's quite annoying, I bet you wished you had waited for one more day before making that purchase. That explain why i use the strategy of buying in bits. Even in my trading strategy, I set multiple orders across several prices to reduce my losses.

 It's understandable that there are several shitcoin in the cryptosphere which may have been the reason for the disappointment and frustrations. One need only a good move to recoup all the losses and MPCX  IEO is the opportunity you have been waiting for. The IEO is live presently on OOOBTC, PROBIT and MPCX platform. This project is backed by IBM, WIZZLE and other great organization. This could be a life changing offer to get the tokens for 5 cents only.

Btc has been giving many holders reasons to be happy due to the increasing value in recent times. I hope that this would be long term as many people are still scared of joining the moving train, scared that a bubble may be imminent.
