LTC was also under valued as fuck. This changes nothing with BTC..It still takes as long to move bitcoin from place to place, THIS LITERALLY DOES NOTHING. People just hyped because they are so bored they want something to be happy about. my thoughts. 
Are you checking the price? Almost down $100 in 3 mins. hmmm Right after this LOCKIN... lol
Maybe i am just salty i did not buy in at $1750 a couple days ago :P
But no hate from me, just salty haha. 
Thanks for your input tho

Well usually i notice "bots" using the same strategy on ALT coins to manipulate the price. That very well could be whats happening.

In theory you have made money. You still made the purchase. If it comes down to it and you really want your money. You might have to contact your bank, tho banks are working with the gov and usually can shut down your account for buying stuff like bitcoins. 
I mean shoot. You could get all three transactions worth of bitcoins then sell the 2 you dont want and make money. lol, this could work out in your favor despit the headache

Because you own less than $1000 btc.. if im wrong, screen shot your balance sucka!!!
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:34:23
No , you probably should not , unless you can sell, make a profit, keep the profit and reinvest back in. my opinion
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:33:34
Well now you are a target regardless because saying that must mean you have over $1000 lol

No there is not, think of it as a "Class" you paid for on learning a lesson in crypto currency, double check EVERYTHING. Do not save passwords on your computer. Use good ol PEN AND PAPER!!

Fear of missing out. aka everyone see's the price rising fast so they buy. More than half these people do not even know what is actually happening. They are all just sheep repeating each other while the wolves actually know whats up. Segwit is smoke and mirrors you dummies.

This is just hype. Segwit means NOTHING. Cool... all the miners are mining it differently. The coin does the same thing now as it did before. This is FOMO hype buying. It will drop.
