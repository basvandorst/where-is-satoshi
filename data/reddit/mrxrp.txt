bitcoin.clarkmoody, just use group by and set it to 50cents or a $1 - or take a look at the order book on bitstamp for a visual representation

The markets are very unnatural, and movements of BTC aren't making sense.
If you took all the fiat put in to bitcoin, and all the fiat taken out, I'd be shocked if the remainder (e.g. funds in bitcoin) wasn't more than the current market cap, and not just a little bit more, a great deal more.
Every bitcoin sold, is one bitcoin bought, and a large percentage of those selling are wanting to buy again at a lower price. Only two things can happen, a major crash or a major rise, and with the amount of buy weight (consider those bids not on the book, those on the dark market, those waiting for a execute when fully filled order and so forth) it seems like it can only go so far down before there aren't enough coins left to buy, forcing a jump.
IMHO this is the death throws of people trying to manipulate the market to buy back in cheap, it'll fail and the price will pump. Opinion of course.

never panic buy or sell as price is changing up or down heavily, if buying wait for it to go back down, wait for a day where it's x% higher than the lowest point in the previous days and then buy. Similarly for sell. I tend to pick 1% for day trades, and 3% for long term buy/sell.

I use a basic bank account out of choice in the UK, and easily route £20-£40,000 per month through it from internal and international transfers, and sending out SEPAs, cash etc - no problems at all.

I trade in 5 to 6 figures, personally I finished buying already, am considering putting some more funds in, and am currently sitting tight until btc is above $250 again, which may well be the end of the year, but I'm confident enough to hold a large amount of stock (for an individual) in a few different currencies (BTC long, XRP long, LTC mid, IFC mid)
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:44:09
four figures, i only ever sell to buy more riding the price changes. I look longer term than most. People see $250 to $90 and panic sell, forgetting that even $90 is an 800-900% rise in under a year, in fact year on year, project that forward a year. Keep selling though.. it's good for those with a view longer than weeks or even a couple of month.

sad, price is too volatile unless they are dumping to usd immediately, they don't have the profit margins to take any negative change in value..
all we really need to do is make a new blockchain with zero rewards where the price is matched to the currency it represents 1:1, then trusted gateways can take over the transference between old and new gateways - that increases the fluidity of money with no risk. simple to do as well.

False, every bitcoin sold is one bought by somebody else, if what you said was true, all they are doing is redistributing more evenly amongst new buyers.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:50:19
just be aware that anything over 300 isn't on trend for another couple of months yet, you could get in cheaper by having some patience.

I said $1000 will be within a year from march of this year, so march 2014. I still hold to that assessment, +/- 10%. If I'd said 100 (let alone 250) was possible last year, you'd have scoffed too, just as if I'd said $10 was possible the year before.
to me this is cheap bitcoin, and everytime somebody bumps or dips the price I increase holdings by 5% or more and sometimes take 5% or more profit out by fiat.

Yes, mtgox just changed their API though so many charts are showing inaccurate / partial / wrong data until they upgrade to the new api.. (a huge part of the current pricing I'm sure!)
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:02:37
for long term:
x = Fiat in to BTC - Fiat out of BTC
y = price * coins mined in a day
if x higher than y, bitcoin goes up in value
if y lower than x, bitcoin goes down in value
for short term:
what goes up quickly also comes back down quickly, if the current price looks like it's way off trend or too high too quickly, then odds are high it'll go back down to lower than the current price.
teach yourself, use logic, look at past trends and patterns, and don't make rash decisions there is no "left behind", you can buy BTC at any time, you may just have to pay a bit more - your fiat investment will still go up over time regardless of when you do it. So it's all about picking the right time.

don't do this, I lost 200 BTC a few months ago by neglecting to use the escrow. Never do this, even if you trust the other person after many trades, DO NOT DO THIS.

It already is, have patience and time, bitcoin is doing phenomenally well considering most techs have a 10 year adoption phase to get widespread.
Just work out the growth percentage wise from 2010-2011, then 11-12, 12-13, it's ~1000% year on year.

exactly, even a tertiary glance at any chart on 3 month or longer time period makes things quite clear

Awesome opportunity, I'm going to offer you the chance of buying the first billion dollar bitcoin, interested? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:59:58
can agree with you selling, but feel 150 may be a bit low.. perhaps 225-250 on a low exchange like btc-e, we'll see though, could be a race over 500 then back to 250-300.. or could just pile over 1k! who knows. Looks ready to dump though.
@_date: 2013-07-04 13:28:34
The price is low..
