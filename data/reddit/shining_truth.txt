I have to say I TOTALLY AGREE with the warning of this post.  Here is my personal experience...
Two days ago I purchased a single contract with Genesis Mining, the smallest they have, just to see what it's all about.  Their smallest BTC mining contract costs $285.00 USD and runs for 5 full years.  I received 2 payouts exactly on time, 1 each day.
But guess how much the payouts were?  The 1st was 0.00002280 BTC and the 2nd was 0.00002227 BTC.  At then BTC prices, those two payouts were worth slightly under 16 cents USD each.  The contract is paying just 16 cents a day.
Now, how many days are in 5 years?  5 x 365 = 1,825 days.  If the contract pays 16 cents per day for 1,825 days, we will have received $292.00 USD.  But we don't get the original $285 that we spent returned to us.  They keep it.  So we are left with just $7 profit over a period of 5 years.  That is a percentage return of 2.4561% over 5 years, which is just 0.4912% per year.  You get a better return from government bonds, which are safer too.
So what is the deal with Genesis Mining and other miners?  What are they trying to do?  Simply, all they do is take investors' money, use it to buy new computer hardware to increase their mining capacity, and keep the coins they mine.  Over the period of the contract, the company simply slowly returns the investors' money back to them.  The end result is that the company borrows money from investors virtually interest free.  They borrow money from investors to buy more hardware to earn more coins, but don't share their gains with the investors.  They keep all the gains for themselves.   They just return the investors' money to them, which is nothing more than an interest-free loan.
Would you want to lend money to a company for no gain at all?  Oh, yeah, there is that $7 profit over 5 years.  Yeah, like that is fair compensation for financing their expanding operations.  Until such companies share their profits with investors more equitably, just stay away from them all together.  They don't care about their investors.  They are using you for interest-free loans.

Yeah, that sounds right.  They start you off at 16 cents a day, and then gradually shrink it to 15, 14, 13, etc.
We are much better off just buying the actual coins themselves.  BTC is expected to hit $20,000 by the end of this year, and that well known BTC capitalist guy - I forget his name now, but everyone into BTC knows who I'm talking about - is calling for BTC to hit $250,000 per coin by 2022.
Yeah, just buy the coins.  And don't finance scammers wealth.
