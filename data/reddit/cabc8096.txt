thanks, i tried that but got this "Parse: Error Parsing Transaction".
some transaction accelerator also don't recognize that txid. i most likely will wait until the internet has to this thing.

Hello, i can't find my txid on blockchain.com. i know the tx are low as f but back in the days there was no fees (0sat/byte in 2 min confirmed), I'm in no rush or so, i just want to move my btc to another address so that i can sell Roger's Trashcash for some BTC. here are my questions, why i don't find my txid and should i'll be concerned? And should i let my BTCcore running 24/7 to not get drop out from the mempool? 
txid 1e8db72ac43861f83957ee92206703151a4482a5d7d7b57af8df1bf41f540e29

what? no it's not a scam, i did buy some back in 2012, it's totally legit, expensive but legit.
edit: btw this exchange is about 10 years old and still here, i mean "VirWox is a scam!" really? As far as I know Virwox is the best way to buy Bitcoin without ID since ever.

I kown i mean i tried some (free) accelerator, and once again Thanks for your help on this but i got this "Error validating transaction: Transaction a9a53747843df28ebfdd363acd9ddc9c886d1eea74689799f49a57b6d87cccda orphaned, missing reference 0000000000290e541ff41bdff87ab5d7d7a582441a1503672092ee5739f86138" and that don't sounds good ^^, i will try the "sendrawtransaction" command, btw is there a way to cancel a unconfirmed transaction from the command line in core?
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:40:52
i can see it in my transaction history but as unconfirmed, in the screenshot you can only see the miners fee because i send it to myself. And yes the fees 100k€ transaction but i only pay 0,01€ lol
