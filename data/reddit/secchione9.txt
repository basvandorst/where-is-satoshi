We're still trying to get details nailed down for the transfer to China.

We were doing a wire. And we were working with US Bank.

What would it say if there is a regular seasonal bump?

I've looked in to it but haven't dove in yet. Do you just fund your Purse account and start shopping?

Is there any kind of reward system for hosting a node?

Are the TX fees paid to nodes?

In the senate committee meeting with our Utah bitcoin bill I had a similar process. Sen. Debakis went off all about how it's used for drugs, how there have been millions lost in exchanges, ie all the problems everyone brings up. My answer was a respectful, "All of those same problems happened with banks times twenty last year, so the problems you are describing are the same with any money system already in use."
He didn't like me very much. The bill still passed out of committee.

It's planned for the interim session of 2016.

Call your state senator and tell them you support it. We expect some pushback in the senate.

I'm not dumb. The House rep that is running it told me we were done and finished, so I posted, then he comes back and says never mind. I thought he was a little crazy when he told me we were done.

They might. It's worth a shot.

Call your state senator and tell them you support it. We expect some pushback in the senate.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:09:59
Update: found from the rep that ran it we have to pass it through the senate first.

We're working with the Deputy State Treasurer on this and have his support.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:20:46
Yeah, it's going to go pretty fast. I'm crossing my fingers.

So far there hasn't been any push back that I have heard about. Our local bitmob will be actively participating in the session and educating legislators. Since, as has been noted, the bill is pretty soft and there isn't a fiscal impact, we're not expecting any real opposition.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:43:43
Call or email your state senator and tell them to support the bill.

Seems like the halvening got priced in during the last breakout. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:23:43
We're working for it. Gold and silver already are to a certain degree. We met with the State Treasurer's office and they said if they have enough people wanting to use it with state properties, they'll push for it.
