I got spammed with like 20 messages with "Oh Noes!  MtGox cracked, move to Trade Hill!!!"
But I don't trade btc, and never used mtGox.  
I do have a btc wallet, with all of like 5 btc, or something, but haven't even run the btc software since I first made the wallet, around a year ago or something.
I did feel like those messages were some kind of spam, really, just trying to promote this tradehill.  I had to come to reddit to verify the veracy of the mtgox crackery.

I was e-mailed like 10 times to inform me of this, and recommend I move to another trading site.  I thought it was spam, to get me to move to this other site.
I see now the crackery did, indeed, occur.
I own all of like 10BTC, anyway.  Not too worried.
Also, I don't recall having ever signed up to mtgox, and mtgox seems to have no record of an acct with the e-mail addy to which I keep getting these repeated messages, so I'm a little confused about that.

I am not a MtGox user, but had to change my gmail password today.
I got like 10 messages about mtgox, with recommendations to move to tradehill.
I do have a btc wallet, but haven't done a darned thing with it since I created it.  
I think I have like 5btc (no idea what that's worth), and haven't done any exchanges, buying or selling of btc since the week I created the wallet. Not mining, and haven't run the btc software since that same week, really.

That's kind of what I thought, but when I go to mtgox and try to login, it says there is not acct with that e-mail address (the gmail).
I can only imagine that whoever was sending these messages grabbed my e-mail from some other btc related site, perhaps?
Then again, I was also one of these who had to change my password...but, perhaps that has something to do with receiving mass e-mails re: the mtgox disaster?

The weird thing is, I don't recall ever using mtgox, and the mtgox site says there is no acct with my gmail address.

I had to change my gmail password today, because "there was suspicious activity" on my account (no further explanation).
Then I got like 10 messages about MtGox with recommendations to move to tradehill.  I never used mtgox.
I have all of like 10btc somewhere, and haven't played with that since the week I first created a wallet. 
Haven't even looked to see if they're still there.
