Every implementation will sooner or later have a critical bug that will be exploited. Let's assume this happens once every 4 years.
The question is whether you want:
A) A bug that takes down the whole network once every 4 years
B) A bug that takes down half the network once every 2 years

Running a full node is only useful for people that are sure their computer is not hacked.

No, it does not. I am pretty sure that the person sending the LN payment with his phone cannot receive a payment.
There are many problems that need to get solved including efficient routing, watchtowers, etc. LN is far from working for the average user. Will probably take another 1-2 years.

It just keeps your node in sync with whatever Blockstream broadcasts. Certainly not a decentralised blockchain anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:20:53
I fully agree with you. Making Bitcoin usable is much more important than having everyone running a full node.
Even Satoshi already assumed most people would be running SPV nodes.
What makes Bitcoin censorship resistant is a sufficient amount of people using it, such that any opposition is political suicide.

Thanks for clarifying my post. Also, here is what happened when blocks were full the first time in March 2017 (see lowest graph):
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:41:50
I believe Moore's law wants to speak to you.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:34:09
Technically you are correct. However, the message I wanted to convey is that blocks were full, leading to insane transaction costs and a significant loss of bitcoin market share in the cryptocurrency space.
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:43:31
Not if you only query 1 address per session. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:58:43
Making it obsolete and useless makes it fragile. See quote from Merkle.
@_date: 2019-02-10 10:11:13
If we want more full nodes we have to increase adoption. I would run a full node if it is an economic node for a business doing more than 1000 USD revenue per day. 
For everything else an SPV client and double checking with some online block explorers is more than enough security.
@_date: 2019-02-23 16:08:17
The wall was that bitcoin dominance crashed down from 86% to less than 40% within a few months when blocks were full.
So even if you personally managed to get along with the full blocks, other people did not think it is a good thing.
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:47:42

The real question is: Which solution will work by pushing a single button on your phone.
@_date: 2019-02-09 21:49:19
There are different levels of verification. Using multiple block explorers is one of them. 
It is up to you to determine the risk level at which you want to run a full node.
For me it is pretty high. And I have a full node that I occasionally run, but usually not for verifying my transactions.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:55:20

@_date: 2019-02-24 11:37:33


What a nonsense. Even to reach this size in 10 years time it would require 200 MB blocks. And in 10 years you will probably be able to buy 100 TB storage without problems.
Anyway, what we need is some reasonable scaling BEFORE blocks get full again.

@_date: 2018-03-14 21:59:33
Big part of bitcoin's privacy comes from the fact that it is impossible to distinguish between the address you are paying to and the change address that is under your control.
By consolidating change addresses it is easily possible to tell which ones were the change addresses and which ones the payment receiver.
Together with more advanced blockchain analysis this undermines privacy.

Thanks, finally had a chance to watch the video about Litbox. Sounds quite interesting.
I still believe, however, that the average person is not willing to do more than installing an app on their phone in order to be their personal bank.
And this in turn means the requirement for some (centralised?) services that make sure that LN channels are properly handled when the phone falls into a toilet.

My understanding is that credit card companies do not allow merchants to charge extra for credit card payments. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:28:44
Decentralization is when you can spend bitcoin at many merchants and not only at a handful of centralized exchanges.
Whether there are 1,000 or 10,000 nodes does not make a big difference in this picture. (As long the nodes are in multiple countries)
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:09:33
More importantly, it is inhabited by something that works faster and cheaper.
But not decentralized.
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:19:05
Next step the narrative will change to "we told you that LN will never work in a truly decentralised way".
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:23:59
Yes, great news. Broken exchanges will be bailed out with taxpayer money. And bitcoin can be officially used for money laundering.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:03:46
Satoshi never assumed there would be non-mining nodes.
When he talks about nodes, Satoshi means mining nodes.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:20:53
A bad day for decentralization and privacy in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:02:18
With "the rest of the LAN" Satoshi means the computers doing the mining computations. The node connected to the outside world is a mining node (even though this node outsourced the actual mining to the server farm).
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:03:27
The negative way to see this is that 50% of bitcoin is a corporate chain from an oligopoly of a few exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:58:10
Why does that reduce UTXOs?
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:56:03
Exactly. Bitcoin should be a digital store of value with government controlled on- and off-ramps. 
Good that Satoshi found the right individuals to teach him. /s

Smaller blocks prevent bitcoin from being used for purchases. Individual purchases are difficult to control for governments.

Your wallet is just a storage for private keys. Your private keys are your proof of ownership of bitcoins and can be used to transfer them.
An address can be derived from a private key. If someone has your private key he can simply calculate the corresponding address.

@_date: 2019-05-23 11:36:27
The actual question is about the minimum transaction value bitcoin should be used for.
Currently the fees are approaching 5 USD.
This makes the minimum viable transaction value around 500 USD assuming 1% fees.
Millennials are already priced out.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:04:26
Behavior and policies of blockstream has been one of the biggest dangers to bitcoin. 
Anyway, bitcoin will live longer than blockstream. Unfortunately it will take lots of time to heal the damage done by this corporation.

Non-mining nodes are passive and do not influence the network. If they don't forward certain blocks, it doesn't matter to the network.
If you could influence a peer-2-peer network that easily, the music industry would have taken down bittorrent a long time ago.

It is really sad that even 5% minority chains are still stable. I assume the problem is legal issues with attacking a minority chain.

Lightning will not onboard anyone with multi-dollar onchain fees.

I agree, I am also using it. However, only because I opened channels at a time with a few cents of fees.

irony or sarcasm :)
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:45:35

Problem might be that the fees for onboarding people onto the LN are already too high.

Blocks will be full and blockstream can sell their own products like liquid.
Also it is easier for governments to control a smaller network that is not used for purchases. They just need to control the exchanges, which they already do.

It doesn't. The market knows this since ~2009.

It is getting dangerous if people have a vetted interest in full blocks. Be it because of financial reasons or because of working on alternative projects.

@_date: 2019-05-17 12:50:59
I agree, but it is dangerous to assume a transaction cannot happen anymore after two weeks.
In particular if you send a transaction to someone else you need to double spend in order to make sure a dropped transaction does not happen in the future.

Dollar cost averaging is nonsense. Bitcoins volatility is between 3% and 6% independent of the time scale. 
In terms of transaction costs it is probably cheaper to buy in 1 or 2 big chunks.

Bitcoin needs some onchain scaling. 
Otherwise we can't even onboard people to the lightning network.
And no, it doesn't have to be 16 MB blocks
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:16:49
It doesn't really matter whether fees are 1,2,5 or 10 USD. All of these numbers are too high to even onboard people onto the lightning network.
And this is at a time without any significant hype going on in the media.
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:42:18
A good rule of thumb is: if you see it in a post on reddit, the market has priced it in.
The halving is known to people since 10 years.

Many excuses have been made why scaling two years ago was not possible.
Promises were made to do some moderate scaling after segwit activated. Yet, 2 years later, nothing happened. 
Meanwhile internet speeds, processing power, and memory space have been growing more than enough for additional scaling.
There are too many people with an interest in bitcoin being congested.
