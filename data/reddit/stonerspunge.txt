The whole internet is filled with fucking idiots, and it is responses like this that make that category grow larger. You can have a decent conversation with someone without treating them like garbage because they disagree with you. If you don't agree with it and aren't going to talk to the person without belittling them, downvote and move on. No sense in being immature about it just because you dont understand why someone got offended by something.

Don't forget this is Reddit. People will say many things when they are safely behind a screen. I don't fully agree with you, but I am sorry that this does offend you. I will always have that in the back of my mind, so I will be more careful if I use it.
I would like to apologize on behalf of the backlash you get from fellow Dogecoin subscribers. Many are likely young and naive.  Come to the subreddit so the rest of us can fix the tainted view you may have from all of this.

I've never made the connection that it was actually a Japanese dog. To me, the "broken english" doesnt have anything to do with race, but more to do with that is how I think a dog, who doesn't normally speak, would speak. Missing important parts of speech and what not. 
I'm sorry that you were offended and you have every right to be. I feel that this is one of those things where I feel you are digging too deep. Today you can find insult in pretty much everything if you look hard enough. 
I'm assuming you wont see this, but in case you do... Know that we "Shibes" don't mean insult in what we do. I would actually recommend you spend a few hours in the subreddit. You will find nothing but kindness and joy towards eachother. All the users are constantly reminding eachother to be generous. You might find that this Japanese dog is actually being well represented.

There are sympathizers because noone needs to be called a panzy or a fucking idiot because they find something insulting. It's fine to disagree with someone, but it can be done in a much better manner.

It doesn't matter whatsoever what you think their value is. It's decided by everyone else that uses it. 
You are being far too abstract with this. Everything you are saying about Bitcoin can be said about fiat. It's all stories we tell ourselves and the trust we all have put into them. The point is Bitcoin works because the story is being told by Bitcoin and everyone has agreed on that because it's transparent and it works. Until 2+2 doesn't equal 4 it will work

That doesn't make sense. A check isn't the money itself just a means of transferring the money. Your check metaphor would be akin to giving someone a USB wallet and telling them you have $5450 worth of Bitcoin on it when you might be lying. The bitcoins are backed by the block chain, not just your word. The Bitcoin has trust, not you. Just like your money has value but your checks do not.

Like I pointed out in a separate comment... This metaphor doesn't make sense
