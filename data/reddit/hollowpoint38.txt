He was actually correct about a fair amount in the article he wrote for Newsweek.  The LA Times wrote about this here:

I'm asking your personal opinion.  I know what a lot of people say but so far no one has made any kind of coherent argument.  Just vague sloganeering and stories about central banks.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:05:51
Here's what I want to know:  
Does he actually believe this bullshit or is he just trying to pump his shitcoins for an exit opportunity?

This.  All these butters talk about how BTC *is* the new currency yet they constantly price things in 'fiat'.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:46:34
And that's the difference between a 'currency' used to buy and sell, and a gambling instrument, which is what most people are using it for.  The only reason they're buying is the hope that others buy too and push the value up so they can eventually cash out.
There might be a few die-hard "this will change the world" guys left, but they are drowned out by the constant scams of exchanges, ICOs, and other actors.  Most people's goal is for BTC to go high so they can cash out in 'fiat' and not have to work.

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.  I don't want to type a paragraph in case that you are.

I agree about buying BTC with debts, but using a CC != debt.  I use my CC for every single purchase I make, I get a cashback bonus, and I pay it to zero every month, therefore incurring no interest charges.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:58:44
Yeah but that gets risky because them claiming their CC was stolen involves them making a sworn statement and a police report is filed.  So they can be facing fines and jail time just like they can for writing hot checks.
You still owe the bank with buyer's remorse on CCs.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:39:09


Heard of the stock or bond market?  No one with common sense just hoards cash and keeps it in Checking.
Wanting a return on your available liquid is normal.  Throwing all your money at crypto and crossing your fingers is not.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:19
So I should be able to use Western Union with my credit card to send cash without paying any cash advance fees and the higher APR?
You do know that zero banks allow you to do this as a CC purchase and will push it through as a cash advance, right?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:53:15
So is a check, if you want to get technical.  Typically when we talk about debt, we mean something that carries over into a following month and that you pay interest on or interest accrues on.
Swiping your credit card and then 20 minutes later doing a transfer from checking doesn't count as debt.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:28:30
That'd be funny if he does.  A "tech revolution" is a huge event.  I wonder how BTC and other shitcoins play a role in this.  I'll wait.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:20:26
ETFs are mainstream and are not typically available in 401k accounts.  Also, half of Americans have no retirement accounts.
Back to BTC, this thing will never have "wide adoption" because it won't be used as a currency.  Every post, every headline is about "how much profit can I make from 'investing' (gambling) in this?".
It's not about the price of goods or anything related to this being used as a currency.  It's a store of value and a speculative instrument.  Not a medium of exchange.
When the Washington Post is featuring stories about cryptocurrency and NBC has headlines about it, it's mainstream.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:50:01
When's the last time bars of gold had "wide adoption" by anyone other than gold buggs?  When was the last time gold was deflationary by nature?  When was the last time the trading of gold was unregulated and involved in ponzi schemes?
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:47:26


Can you elaborate on this a little more?
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:27:11
Bitcoin went mainstream when CNBC started doing segments on it and it hits the WSJ.  
Most people don't own any stocks outside of retirement accounts.  Are stocks not mainstream?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:48:43
Well, it's pretty crafty if you can buy with a CC, get 2% cash back, and then you have something that is (theoretically) convertible to cash.
It'd be like a free cash advance.  This is exactly why if you send money Western Union with a credit card, it goes down as a cash advance with the fees and APR associated.  If not, it would allow you to send money to yourself and get around the cash advance fees and rules.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:44:26
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:38:18
Yeah, definitely don't do that.
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:34:57
But there is a whole lot of gold here.
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:35:31
Good choice if you did.
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:33:26
What about now?
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:24:12
I can't stand tax protestors and Tea Party people.  They have no problem using the services and benefits taxes provide but they lie on their returns and hoard their cash to not pay.  We refer to then as dead beats.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:43:15
Yeah so my comments are mainly to high net worth people, people with investments, and a lot of discretionary income.  A wage earner in the Midwest at some restaurant is not what I mean.
EDIT: since you edited.  $60k?  Lol.  Yeah dude, thats not a lot of money.  That will get you a rundown studio in Southern California and an economy car to drive.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:36:12
Ok yeah you're a wage earner.  
If you had investments etc you'd owe the IRS money like I do for the dividends and interest I get off of my stocks and bonds.  You'd file a Schedule C if you were a sole proprietor self employed.
Since you're just a wage earner the chances of you being audited are low if you do all of your crypto things offshore and you live in a low cost area.  IRS prioritizes wealthy individuals and business owners for audit.

Face is not a concept used in the US.
I know being from the deep South means these concepts may seem foreign to you.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:52:17


That's US tax code.  And that's the amount that can exceed gains.  Other countries allow you to carry back losses to previous years.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:14:04
Yeah no one cares about a big house if it's in a hell hole.  Walk outside and you're still in a hell hole.
$240k gets you a parking space in the Bay Area.
And you're a tax protesting Tea Party guy so I don't need the lecture about judging you.  I hate tax protestors.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:56:01


It takes the IRS about 3 years to really get on you.  When they do, it's like a freight train.  Some states, like California, have the Franchise Tax Board which is worse than the IRS.
So guys can think they're clear, and then in 2021 they'll get notices.  Ignore the notices and the IRS plus the state will start taking money out of their bank accounts and charging a "convenience fee" for doing so.

Lose face?  Sorry we're not in Beijing.  And it's a shitcoin sub and I'm talking to a tax evader who works food service. I'm not worried.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:24:22
OP mentioned the planet, so it's a little unclear.  I wrote what I wrote for clarification for other readers.
A whole lot of people in here are not financially literate and don't understand how the tax code works in their home country.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:43:10
So you do pay taxes.  Then what do you mean about not being audited?  You said you work in the "restaurant industry" so I take it you're a wage earner and you don't have any investments that are paying dividends and interest?
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:23:28
So you muck around with your taxes every year?  Ok...
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:33:06
Haha Houston Texas.  Yeah dude, no way I'd live there.  You couldn't pay me enough. And it's a Red state.  Yeah climate change is fake right?
I'm happy with my life. I hate tax protestors.  No problem using our services and taking advantage of things like our defense structure but then you try hard to not pay your share.  That's a dead beat lifestyle.  The fact that you brag about $60k annual just gives it more comedy.  But in reality, tax protestors are pieces of shit.
