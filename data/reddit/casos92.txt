How do you guys fund your bitstamp accounts? Is it possible to use a US bank account?

My fantasy football league invested our prize money into crypto, and I'm holding it in my coinbase account.  I'm not going to win the league so I won't get any money but what will the tax implications be for the person who does win?  I don't want to be taxed so I'm thinking the best thing to do would be to make whoever wins set up a coinbase account, then send them the coins and have them convert to fiat if they want to.

I definitely agree that investing is the wiser choice, I just don't think FDIC insurance should be a big factor when deciding what to do with your money. 
 If you want your money to grow, throw it into some mutual funds, if for some reason you just want to sit on it and have minimal worry of losing any of it then I don't see how keeping it in a checking account is unsafe.  For FDIC insurance to pay out there would have to be a substantial economic crisis.

I see this mentioned a lot but how often does someone need to to make a claim to the FDIC? The banks would have to go under which is pretty unlikely.  You are much more likely to lose money investing it than by keeping it in a bank account. Of course, you can gain money from investing it so that is definitely preferable, but if you just want to sit on your money and not worry about losing any I don't see how keeping it in the bank is any more risky than investing it.

Was it the private key on the back? If so wouldn't users be weary of the coin producer knowing it?

I moved my coins out of coinbase into electrum around 8:00pm PT last night. How do I verify that I now have BCC in addition to my BTC? Electrum shows my BTC but doesn't say anything about BCC.

Thanks!  Do you know if theres a way to check on a website?  Similar to how you can look up a wallet's BTC value on blockchain.info

5dimes has some serious issues with leaking customer information. I would not recommend using them.
