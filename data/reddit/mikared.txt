I think one problem is that Bitcoin has been framed in a really political way. While it's cool if it aligns with someone's political views, emphasizing it in that way makes it seem more exclusive and intense.
There needs to be more focus on the broader problems it's solving and how it can be an efficient and economical solution.

Also, BTC is great for nonprofits to raise donations since they lose much less in fees.

Though I'm always hesitant to name specific companies.
I'd say to at least research the track record and reputation of any exchange you chose. Location is also an important consideration.

I love this idea in theory, but I question how sustainable or scalable an all-volunteer organization is.
I think transparency is most important. It makes sense that those helping/working for organizations get compensated, but it does need to be reasonable.

I agree that Coinbase provides a pretty easy user experience that's nice for beginners.

**Pop-Culture Index or “what’s hot, what’s not”**
The idea is to empower individuals to predict future trends before they become popular. Trends can be be split by language or geographical regions.  
Fashion and Music have underlying financial motives and value and can be easily quantified via social and other channels (detailed below).  
With this index, people can front-run culture and become trend setters, rather than followers.  
In many predictions, users are powerless, and merely bet or guess. But with music and fashion, users can participate on every level and even promote their own items if they fit within the requirements. For these reasons, I think this is more interesting and interactive.   
  
  
**Fashion:**   
Listing a trend: Designers (or anyone with a design idea) can upload photos or designs of trend ideas, such as:   
1. The designer’s upcoming seasonal line  
2. A specific trend idea  
3. A design or prototype of an article of clothing  
Types of votes: Using data set, quantify the success level needed then allow users to vote successful (hot) or not  
Timelines: The timeline will be 3-4 months, which is long enough for a full fashion season.  
Quantifying real world data: what real world data will be used to justify voting.  
1. company sales metrics   
2. website/search terms for items   
3. social media metrics  
  
  
**Music**   
Listing a song:  
1. Band name    
2. Album or Song Title   
3. Available recording   
4. Name of Record Label   
Public listing of song for data extraction (youtube, soundcloud, website/search)   
Types of votes: Using data set, quantify the success level needed then allow users to vote successful or not   
Timelines: Period of time allocated for success (3-6 months?)

This could be a useful application for the Common Core debacle

"Explaining Bitcoin in depth would take multiple pages, a primer in cryptography and some dedication on your behalf. "
This (exaggerated) statement is a major reason, in my opinion, why Bitcoin hasn't entered the mainstream. 
Just like how I don't really care how my debit card works, I'm sure a lot of people would be open to using Bitcoin if it wasn't required for them to comprehend so much tech talk. A lot of good resources are beginning to come out aimed at engaging a wider audience, but my guess is it will take some more time for BTC to be mainstream.

Good luck!

Not sure if this helps, but Global Impact does provide their annual reports on [their website]( 
"In 2014, Global Impact achieved an overall administrative and fundraising expense ratio of 12 percent, a fraction of the 35 percent deemed acceptable by the Better Business Bureau and a guarantee that more money reaches the people who need it most."

I understand what you're saying, but I think it's reasonable that people get compensated a fair wage for their work. 
Just because it's for a good cause and nonprofit doesn't mean people should work for free.

You might want to go to [I'd suggest researching exchanges that are easy to use if you're starting out.

I think providing some info on WHY they should accept Bitcoin and how easy it is would be important if you're doing this.
I'd say either have conversations in person or leave the card with your email so they can contact you for information. Or even leave some really basic resources.

I was also going to suggest Coinbase for a beginner

This warms my heart. I am super passionate about saving elephants and Bitcoin, so this is pretty much the coolest thing ever.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:57:30
I wish I had better advice. If you feel comfortable writing a letter and explaining why and how they should accept Bitcoin, go for it.
If not, maybe ask a friend or someone to help you.
Good luck!

I actually worked on a project that used board games to teach folks how the Bitcoin network works. It was rule set in which players use a "blockchain" instead of a bank to play banking games (like Monopoly). 
It was pretty fun.

I actually think this would be great for teaching adults about core concepts. It seems (at least based on those 2 pages) super straight-forward and visual.
Great idea, but it might be too complex for *some* children. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:21:13
I guess just email them explaining why you think they could benefit from accepting BTC. Keep it brief and succinct, and maybe include an easy step-by-step on how to do it?

It was for Monetsu - a BTC company (
You can download the not-quite-finished version if you scroll to the end of the homepage or go here: 
You have to provide your email though.
Edit: Jeez, another typo. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:54:46
I think all (or at least most?) people should accept BTC.
With that said, you should totally email some game developers you like asking them about it. Why not? :)
