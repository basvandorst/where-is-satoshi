Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that the IRS has determined that bitcoin will be considered property, not a currency. For most investors, particularly those who have been in the bitcoin game for a long time, this is a favorable ruling; accrued long-term gains and losses will be taxed at each investor’s applicable capital gains rate (15% for Max) as opposed to at ordinary income rates (this would be 25% for Max). Bitcoin miners and investors may see a huge difference in marginal rates as a result of this distinction. Nonetheless, active traders with short-term capital gains could still be taxed at their ordinary income-based rates, so it’s a good idea to consult with a tax professional.

Over leveraged investors will get wiped out if there’s a big dip but as long as new money is flowing in and more mainstream adoption, I see the prices continuing upward

Stocks allow you to choose which stock you sell. I would take the coin with the highest cost and pair that with the sold coin to calculate the net gain/loss. Defers higher capital gains on the coins you hold.

Likely to see items priced in satoshi’s. Each bitcoin (BTC) is divisible to the 8th decimal place, so each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 units. Each unit of bitcoin, or 0.00000001 bitcoin, is called a satoshi. A Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin.

Pretty much, they will be a crypto backed lender which allows you to exchange their tokens for a discount to the interest rate. I checked the site again and they raised the price to 7 SALT.  Their tokens are trading at 33% of the $25 value they credit you against the interest payment

I had a similar issue with US Bank and resolved by calling g my bank and advising them these were authorized transactions. If that doesn't work I would consider another banking institution for your crypto investing.

This is a sign you should do some research rather than ask someone to read a crystal ball for you.
