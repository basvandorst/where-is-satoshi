I’ve been using the Crypto.com to hold my BTC, MCO and CRO. So far very pleased with it. Super simple and easy to use and fees are very low. I’m no expert when it comes to crypto currency though. My card is on its way right now :)

Crypto.com wallet is super easy to use and has very low fees. That’s what I use :)

Yes I agree the war on drugs is terrible. Not saying the country is a saint. No country is.

The overall crypto market cap is still really small, leaving it more susceptible to volatility. He’s not posting lies...

I never said it was the best, although I hold it in high regard. The US could be the best country, but I’m not going to make that claim as I haven’t fully explored this. I was just responding to you saying it’s by far the worst country ever. I find it interesting you say “how could someone say the US is the best”, yet your willing to claim it’s the worst. The US has done more good than it has harm, but not arrogant enough to say we are perfect. I don’t think this is worth going around and around about though.

Did it not happen?
Edit: I’m not saying there isn’t corruption in the US government because there certainly is, especially the last decade or so. But that being said we have done a lot of good in the world, and things very likely would be much worst if it wasn’t for the US.

Worst country ever... ya definitely worst than Russia and China ��. Countries that are responsible for millions upon millions of deaths as a result of communist regimes.

If you stake the card you can get 8% return and without the stake you get 6%.

You don’t incur fees converting BTC to fiat... I’ve found purchasing crypto on their wallet has the the lowest amount of fees.

I second this! I’m in the US so I have a card which makes it even better. But their wallet makes buying bitcoin and other crypto’s very simple.

Stop making these kids puppets to push agendas. Just a propaganda strategy

Social media is a much bigger impact on mental health...
