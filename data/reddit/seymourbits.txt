this is a fairly optimistic article on Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:00:18
Not sure if this has been mentioned yet but you should definitely check out the search engine Spendabit at  if you're eager to find more places that accept Bitcoin... they have a huge searchable database of products from most Bitcoin merchants including a lot of really unique smaller merchants. It's my 1st stop when I'm going to make a purchase. GL.
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:51:26
Yes, but I find the data to be fairly outdated and incomplete.
@_date: 2016-06-01 01:57:43
I've been following this Bitcoin search engine project for a while now (mid-2014 I think) - and I'm always impressed, very nice job. Now, when will Brazil and South America get officially supported??

That was George Bell, former CEO of Excite... he told me the story personally over diner... "there's no market for search" is what he said to Larry and Sergey. Seems ridiculous but at the time it was all about portals. Who knows what would have happened if he did buy Backrub, it may have been lost and we would be in a universe without Google.
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:39:54
Also try  - they index products from a lot of smaller Bitcoin-accepting merchants too. Should be able to search for some pretty good Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals there

Because it fits the of classic patterns of subtle propaganda to influence an objective, in this case: get out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:00:26
Let's see, someone who made "hundreds of thousands" in Bitcoin, somehow already did not have a reddit account until yesterday, then boasting "I'm out!" about selling at the top right before the 10k tipping point and making a specific point to say he is going to make sure to pay all taxes, because "he is not messing with Uncle Sam", yes I'd say you are correct with your conspiracy.

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:23:59
Thanks BashCo, that's good to know. I was on my edge of my seat when it was about to go to the "big leagues" first page. It's really more for everyday peeps vs the experts here anyway, who may think it is dumb. Lessons learned, have a good day.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:34:13
I wondered this myself, as it was interesting. This may be the reason (from Community guidelines):
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed

Yes... This is exactly how we will get through to the other 99.999% and help save them from the upcoming financial apocalypse! This show is not actually directly aimed at Bitcoin veterans like us, though there will be some inside jokes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:20:43
It's a power thing. If the world adopts Bitcoin (as it appears it is heading to) then fiat recedes into a lesser state and then they start losing the ability to print endless "money"... This is disruptive to their economy and they fear that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:06
Thanks! What's that monkey on the right doing?
As I was finishing it I saw another natural 0 to the right of him... a sign of 110,000 perhaps? :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:55:13
I wonder if the same shenanigans can keep a post off the front page too? I ask because my 3D animated Bitcoin project post yesterday came so close:
But then it fell down just as it was about to move to page 1. I think could have been the time of day too. Now I kind of wish I waited until the morning. Ah, artist problems...
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:59:32
Thanks! Since this show is most beneficial for those who are unaware of Bitcoin vs us here, I'll try reaching that one... Do you have any other suggested subreddits that could be a good fit?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:15:40


Very kind, but apparently you missed the clue that "it" was a "redditor" for only a few hours, oh observant "redditor for 2 weeks". FTFY
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:21:11
Which one? Are they still around? Probably not.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:23:37
I tried me_irl, based on your mention:
It seems so be doing well so far. That's a cool subbreddit, thanks for the intro... very "pure", almost like a game, and I like whatever ranking system they use as it looks like decent submissions have a *chance* to stick around beyond just a few hours. Still haven't figured out what "irl" means yet though... maybe "I really love"?

Well, [Spendabit is still around]( ... So I guess at least *some* people must be using BTC as God intended.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:16:00
Point taken. Consider that Spendabit is primarily a USA engine but expanding every day, including in your area.
Try actually searching for something, say, "socks" and see what comes up:
Do you actually need more than 5,480 different choices for socks?
Your numbers are actually quite encouraging though. Think of how many product results Spendabit will have when the adoption rate hits just 1%... socks-wise, that is.

You are indeed hopeless. However I will make you the following offer:
Choose a number of years from today (within our reasonable lifetimes) and if Bitcoin is $0 on that date I will pay you the entire price difference between the current price and $0. If Bitcoin is over today's price, you pay just the amount over the current price to me.
Agreed? You have thousands of dollars to gain, right?

Bitcoin is picking up the pace as a medium of exchange... Spendabit lists over 3 million products from hundreds of Bitcoin-accepting merchants and growing. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:37:22
The value of anything is what people will pay for it at the moment. A Picasso is only worth millions because of the current perceived value, otherwise it is fire kindling. Try selling your "beloved" gallon of gasoline to a tribal leader in the Amazon or to a EV owner for that matter. The current value of a Bitcoin is 3553 USD.

From the hardware and date info provided you can deduce he mined ~1000 Btc, worth near $4 million today. Whether he was a long term hodler or not is undetermined, as is the exact profit but it should be significant.

How about a 4K TV, for example: 
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:20:31
I think I was fairly close on my 1,000 Btc call on the aggregate number of coins you mined? I based my estimate on the hardware you were using and the very early date inferred by the $5 target price.
Love hearing early adopter stories like yours. We all wish we held more of those early coins but know it was resolve like yours in getting Btc accepted that has made the difference. Keep up the good work and check out  for spending, if you don't already.

I have a replaced laptop hard drive (OS shenanigans) with Btc that I seem to have forgotten how to access. Maybe someday it will come to us :)

And this illustrates exactly why Bitcoin will succeed: Because on one side you have thoughtful, logical hypothesis-driven points based on observed facts and on the other you have terrified, manure filled drivel intended to obfuscate and confuse the uninformed. The light will win and the dark towers will fall.

You're confused. Gasoline, like all things, has perceived value. No more value than a gallon of water. Less to you if you are thirsty, but more if you have access to and desire to run a generator. "Society" processes the demand against the supply in a "market" and that's where "price discovery" comes in. The demand for Bitcoin: a decentralized, digital transactional cryptographic currency is a price of 3,755 USD, up over $200 from my last post.

good news guys! see a new post from Coinbase below:
This morning we discovered a phishing attack that came via email, requesting users to click to accept New User/Service Agreement.
This prompted users to sign in to their accounts and authorize a malicious application to remove bitcoin from their Coinbase Wallet.
We found this malicious application relatively quickly, and we shut it down. Only a small number of users were affected, and we will be reaching out to them directly.
We will be reimbursing the affected users the bitcoin that they lost, while we continue the investigation.
To stop this from happening again, we are reassessing our API/application approval process, as well as re-visiting the limits of money that can be sent over an application. Lastly, we began to talk about how we can proactively reach out customers and educate them on how to use their Coinbase Vaults as a more secure way of storing their bitcoin.
We appreciate the feedback and patience with this matter.
The Coinbase Team

Dirty stuff?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:36:41
The best argument against Bitcoin that I've heard is that a key characteristic of a successful currency is to have some small amount of inflation in order to incentivize the spending of it.
Ironically, spending your Btc was a far more popular ideology in the early days, with those legendary pizzas experiments and such.
Nowadays, nearly everyone now wants to hodl and I suspect spending Btc at places like  occurs more out of fear of loss rather than any of the other legacy reasons.
