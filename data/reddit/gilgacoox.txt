I think your definition is wrong. Bitcoin Maximalism is based on the idea that competitition in certain markets is harmful to the ecosystem when the considered good is already perfect or close to perfect!  When we look at money,  crypto currencies like Bitcoin are already close to perfect, especially if you consider the scarcity property (the amount of value tokens is fixed  - you cannot improve on that).   Bitcoin maximalists believe that improvements to crypto currencies can and should be achieved without creating new value tokens. Concepts that are considered suitable are Proof of Burn (Counterparty) or Side Chains for example.
The 2nd idea is that the choice which money we use is a coordination game (game theory) and that Bitcoin as the currently "best" widely adopted money is the schelling point of that game. Bitcoin maximalists think that all market participants should agree on that and that any other currency that creates "money"  out of thin air is not legimate

Why don't you create a prediction market if your contract is fullfilled? You can hash sensitive contract infos.    Fairlay.com is the biggest Bitcoin prediction market and let's you create these markets. There are also Prediction Markets on Ethereum - though not live yet and with higher fees.

This is just your keynesian view. The deflationary spiral you are talking about (during the great depression for example) was mostly caused by the debt money system itself.

I hope this is fake. I will stop using Poloniex and consider it a scam if it is not /u/mike-poloniex.
