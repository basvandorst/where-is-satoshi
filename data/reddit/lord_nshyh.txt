I understand where you're coming from, but I have to disagree.  Had this been closed source, it may have never been found except by someone paranoid to monitor ALL network traffic, every single last socket, on their personal machines/VMs.

As someone who loves investing, please, make eBay stock bearish so that it becomes temporarily undervalued in the market.  Then people will buy and make a nice sum of money once the value goes back; all thanks to your "hacktivism."  TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.

Agreed.  I am going to wait, but this is awesome.

I was referring to the "asking the robot" question.
People are fed up with the US government shamelessly exploiting and murdering citizens.
