"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." Thomas Jefferson in the debate over the Re-charter of the Bank Bill (1809)

Mother nature's ultimate evolution goal is singularity, and bitcoin is preparing our monetary system for the singularity.
If i interpret Rai Kurzweils articles right he basically says we need more money because the economy will grow exponentially.
But more money printed from the FED != more money for technical evolution.
But if all wealth flows into bitcoin and to silicon valley instead of the banks, there will be alot more real investments into technologies leading to the singularity.

Not needed, dont need to earn interest on this ;) anyway, good luck with the password, if you dont remember anything then most likely it wasnt some super long super strong password?
Otherwise maybe you write it down somewhere?
Just use that wallet recovery service and give him all your regular passwords and names of family members, birthdates etc.

Wikipedia describes Nassim Taleb’s Black Swan Theory as follows:
“1) the disproportionate role of high-impact, hard to predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance and technology, 2) the non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to their very nature of small probabilities) and 3) the psychological biases that make people individually and collectively blind to uncertainty and unaware of the massive role of the rare event in historical affairs.”

The OS doesnt really matter if you use a device just for bitcoin, you get laptops for 100$ which are good enough to run bitcoin, so if you are holding bitcoins worth a few 100$ or more just invest into a "bitcoin laptop" and maybe harden it a bit (wlan only set to public network mode / firewall blocking everything) and dont use it for anything except bitcoin.
