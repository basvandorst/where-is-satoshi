I carry one around with me and slam it down on a bar counter occasionally. It's remarkable how many people ask if it is worth thousands.

Hey boo, here you go:

    def HOTP(
        secret   = None, # secret value known to both server and client
        interval = 1     # number incremented between each token generation
        ):
    
        """
        Generate and return a hash-based one-time passcode.
        """
    
        key     = base64.b32decode(secret, True)
        message = struct.pack("&gt;Q", interval)
        HMAC    = hmac.new(key, message, hashlib.sha1).digest()
        o       = (HMAC[19] if sys.version_info &gt;= (3,) else ord(HMAC[19])) &amp; 15
        HMAC    = (struct.unpack("&gt;I", HMAC[o:o + 4])[0] &amp; 0x7fffffff) % 1000000
    
        return HMAC
    
    def TOTP(
        secret   = None, # secret value known to both server and client
        interval = 30    # number of seconds between each token generation
        ):
    
        """
        Generate and return a time-based one-time passcode, changed at an interval
        of a specified number of seconds.

            interval = int(int(time.time()) / 30)
        )
    
    print(TOTP(secret = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"))

Aw yea!
Actually they work well for the weather and the lights confuse the neighbours.

Thanks! We weathered the storm. Bitcoin truly *can* do anything.

I'm a miner and support core and SegWit. Let's not have unverified dodgy shite like SegWitx2.
