You should look at the Segwit2x mailing list. It is full of Core developer comments.

With normal transaction patterns, the current segwit will have blocksize of a bit less than 2 MB. Segwit2x will have blocksizes of a bit less than 4 MB.
Both is not a real danger for decentralisation. Just too much FUD being thrown around.

No, because our master BashCo decides what's the truth.

Litecoin has 1MB blocks every 2.5min. This is similar to the expected blocksize with segwit2x.

Most etfs will follow the chain with most PoW.

I thought Gavin Andresen is supporting Segwit2x...

So what? It is a problem of bitcoin if this is possible and not a reason to complain about law enforcement or companies.

It is a good time to invest now in a time of uncertainty. After the hardfork in November the price will go up.

Core developers are an incoherent group of people. Several of them actually contribute to Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:35:16
The main developer of Segwit2x is a Core developer.

You mean because it is very important to always pick a side and stick to your sports team?

Past performance does not predict future performance. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.

You mean like neutral facts? I never saw any pros here.

Open source projects are way older than bitcoin.
If the "consensus by developers" existed for such a long time, why has it never been used to make a cryptocurrency?

In future people can still chose to run the client they want. 
And if you disagree with future decisions of the btc1 developers you are free to chose a different implementation. 
Freedom of choice.

The title is not a sentence.

Checked. My reading comprehension seems to be ok.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:12:06
The majority of people with cypherpunk ethos support freedom of speech and open discussions.

Doesn't sound very welcoming. Nevermind.

I see it as leaving the overly conservative scaling blockers behind.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:30:20
Why is the age of my account related to this?
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:04:01
My post says "with normal transaction patterns". You quote theoretical limits that will never be achieved. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:43:15
I don't understand. Are you getting some extra benefits for having an older account?
