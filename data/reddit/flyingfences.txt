Unfortunately, you can't use it with TOR because it uses UDP. You'd need to funnel it through a proper VPN.

I don't have anything in particular, but the devs have been commenting in this sub for quite some time and that's the gist of things.
@_date: 2016-04-05 03:32:41
Sort of. There's no actual "mining" in the sense that you're thinking of. It's more like bittorrent in that it's primarily just data being shared between nodes; there's not a lot of computation going on. Every so often a checksum of this data is pegged to the bitcoin blockchain to say "yeah, this stuff is legit". At least, that's how I understand it.

So nothing revolutionary in the works (in terms of anonymity) but there will be TOR support (or something like it) some time down the road.
Plus, it's open source, so someone could fork it if the OB1 devs aren't going in a satisfactory direction.

It's a completely decentralized network - a la bitcoin or bittorrent - so it's impossible for any party to control and impossible for any party to eliminate. People running individual nodes can be targeted, but the network as a whole is invulnerable to interference.

The first release had to be something that the venture capitalists were willing to have their name behind. If it was obviously all drugs from day one, nobody would have funded it. Now that it's functional, they're going to start working more on the anonymity features while the existing release helps them build good reputation.

Frankly, it doesn't matter. If you use MG, you're not actually giving them control of your money in any way. Coinbase, BitPay, and similar companies act as intermediaries. Customers pay CB/BP in BTC, and then CB/BP pays the vendor in USD. With MG, customers pay BTC to a wallet controlled entirely by the vendor, who can then exchange them to USD as he sees fit. MG, as I understand it, has no control over the process, they simply provide the code for vendors to run on their servers to automate the transactions and verifications.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:39:38
Yes; as I understand it, it's up to the vendors to exchange or not.

Alphabay is hosted by someone, somewhere. If that goes down, either as a result of the site operators taking it offline or as a result of a government attack (like what happened with SR), then it's gone. OpenBazaar is a decentralized network, like Bitcoin or BitTorrent, so if one node goes down the rest of the network is not compromised and business can continue as usual.
Also, vendors don't have to pay that $200 vendor fee, the other fees are also gone, and your wallet is hosted locally so you retain control of your coins so that there's no possibility of an exit scam.

The OB dev team has included a "dual stack" option whereby you can connect to the OB network both over Tor and over the "clearnet". I haven't looked too deeply into exactly how it's structured, so I may be wrong about this last bit, but it should be possible for dual-stack clients to bridge the gap, in a manner of speaking, so that clearnet clients can interact with Tor-only stores.

It's not there yet. The 1.0 release is basically just a network for finding other people hosting OB nodes. Your IP address is visible; you have to keep your server online to keep your store online. It's basically just a proof-of-concept in development at this point. The 2.0 release, due out some time this year last I heard, is going to fix those issues and others and is actually intended to be a usable platform for secure commerce.

How big would the blocks need to be in order to handle that many transactions on-chain? Hint: it's a lot bigger. SegWit+LN literally only improves the situation.


Maybe not, but you can get pretty damn far. You also seem to be operating under the assumption that SW+LN in their current states are the only off-chain scaling solutions that we will ever need. In their current form, they can sustain the level of activity growth projected for the Bitcoin network for quite some time. Eventually other scaling solutions will be needed, but those will come with time. We will have *years* to develop them once SW+LN are enabled.


You do realize that *anybody* will be free to create LNs and sidechains, right? Saying that *only* BS will be making money from LN is akin to saying that *only* Jihan makes money from mining. It's completely ridiculous.

The argument isn't that carrying capacity is quadrupled; the argument (which you're carefully avoiding) is that the block size is quadrupled. People running segwit-enabled full nodes have to wrangle four times the data.

Development on the 2.0 release - which re-works the OB network in major ways - has been going at full speed for the last year or so. During that time, effort has not been wasted on integrating new features into the 1.0 release that is going to be superseded by 2.0 in a few months.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:57:09


Right. Available download bandwidth is very rarely the bottleneck in any connection - it's almost always the upload bandwidth of the data source. If your source is bouncing off its rev limiter then you're not going to get the data any faster no matter how high your download speed - unless you draw from more sources.


As more and more nodes (read: potential sources) reduce the number of other nodes that they will serve, your (and everybody else's) probability of getting a connection to any one of them lowers. As more and more nodes reduce the number of other nodes that they will serve, your (and everybody else's) download speed suffers. And so, as some nodes cut down connections to retain bandwidth, large swaths of the network suffer.
Block propagation isn't just a matter of block propagation - it's a matter of block propagation *in a timely manner*. Any node that takes the whole ten minutes to download the block is going to be a whole block behind the rest of the network. If, as happens from time to time, several blocks are found in quick succession then those nodes will be several blocks behind and will take even longer to catch up. Sure, that's fine for the occasional payment; but, that's no way to run a business. In order for Bitcoin to actually be *usable* as a currency, it has to sync at a decent rate. Any community (physical, geographical) that cannot stay properly in sync with the blockchain cannot *practically* use Bitcoin.
Actually that's a great use for Blockstream's new satellite scheme (see, they're not all evil). Nodes can use the sat stream to receive the blocks quickly and then use their slower internet connections to verify the blocks. Still, though, that's placing far too much reliance on a service that may not be available in the future. It's not a tenable sole solution.


Oh, to be certain there are more probable vectors. However, that is no excuse for opening up the door unnecessarily and just hoping that nobody will come through it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:59:47

That would be fine for my individual node, although it would still put a bite (heh) into any other uploads that I'm trying to do. My worries are still twofold, though.
First of all, there are still people with a weaker connection than my own. I am not the ideal benchmark of permissivity.
Secondly, a network is stronger, healthier, more resilient when its nodes have more connections to other nodes. As more and more nodes have fewer and fewer connections, the network becomes weaker and the possibility of bottlenecks and interruptions grows. Certainly, it is acceptable for a handful of nodes here and there to run in such a minimal state when the alternative is not running at all. But, my concern is that more and more nodes are so marginalized and put at risk by each block size increase. If one node in a thousand needs to run with only a couple of connections, then so be it - that's probably about where we are now. As Bitcoin sees increased adoption in developing economies, however, I would not be at all surprised to see that number jump an entire order of magnitude if 8MB blocks are imposed upon the network. Of course, infrastructure development will eventually enable all of these areas to handle 8MB blocks, but I have a hunch that if we allow 8MB blocks now then by that time, as the third world is just starting to catch up and get back in the game, there will be comfortably first-world people saying that the network can handle even larger blocks and advocating a fork that again kicks down the developing communities.

That 128kbps is the *download* requirement. A healthy network requires that its nodes have multiple peers from which they download and to which they upload. The upload requirement for a node syncing 8MB blocks to a handful of peers is several times that.

You are showing that you are the scammers if you are trying to claim that a shared history means a shared current state. How many merchants accept BCH? How many services run on BCH? How many exchanges trade BCH? How many people want to use BCH? How many wallets can hold BCH? How many miners are even backing BCH? BCH is nearly completely useless. Trying to sell it to clueless newcomers as if it has *any* of the benefits of XBT is misleading at best. When some poor schmuck gets sold BCH instead of XBT and realizes that his shitcoins are useless, that will reflect poorly on the entire crypto community.

"Network speeds" aren't one number for everyone. It's a distribution - probably a fairly normal distribution. Some parts of the world have very good internet. Most have decent internet. Some have very bad internet. Some few still have none at all. Yes, the median of that curve will shift higher over time. Yes, that trend could allow those who are on the network now to handle a higher throughput in the future. Of more interest to me, though, is the trend of more and more areas moving from slow to decent internet or from none to slow. Over time, those areas will become able to participate fully in the Bitcoin network *if* the requirements for participation remain constant. If, however, the requirements for participation in the Bitcoin network grow at a rate that keeps pace with the growth in typical internet speeds then those areas that are currently unable to participate will never gain the ability to participate.
My personal view, guiding my positions in this scaling debate, is that the highest priority of the Bitcoin community should be to extend access to as many people as possible, to "bank the unbanked" as we used to say; this necessarily means not raising the participation requirements above their current level for as long as is humanly possible. Of course, we must be careful not to grow at the cost of usability - the carrying capacity of the network *does* need to grow. The challenge then becomes finding a scaling solution that enables throughput growth without inducing participation requirement growth. SW+LN achieves exactly that, which is why I support it.
So, to come back and answer your question as concisely as possible: it would remain a relevant attack vector with the potential to disrupt a different, new set of nodes that are currently not on the network at all.

@_date: 2017-08-20 21:53:15
The block size *can be* quadrupled at any moment though. We're talking about security and practicality. If an attacker can spam the network with blocks that are near 8MB, thereby taking a large subset of full nodes offline, then that is a weakness in the Bitcoin protocol. The protocol should be crafted to be resistant to attacks, not to open up the network to new vectors.

The more you restrict the size of the witness data, the more you restrict the number of transactions that can be included in the typical witness block. The aim is to provide the greatest possible witness payload without overwhelming nodes on weaker connections. The most complete study that I've seen so far indicated that most of those at-risk nodes can handle up to about 4MB blocks. So, setting the absolute cap at 4MB - and therefore the typical size markedly lower - allows the largest permissible payload.

I see nodes all over Latin America and Southeast Asia.
I am in in support of segwit . I see it as necessary. Clearly, a 1MB hard limit does not allow the network to function properly for first-world users. We need more capacity. As significantly-higher on-chain capacity hinders access in developing economies, we need an off-chain solution. segwit enables off-chain solutions and is the only ready and stable solution that does so. (Additionally, it is constructed in a manner that allows nodes to ignore it and continue transacting purely on-chain if they must.) We need segwit and there's no way around that. So, we have to set the segwit block cap at some level. If we set it too high then we exclude too many users from its use. If we set it too low then we exclude too many transactions from its use. At the time that the current segwit cap was settled upon, a study was circulating that seemed to show that 4MB was the upper limit that most nodes can handle. So, a maximum setting of 4MB - and therefore the typical size somewhat less - is a "sweet spot" from my perspective.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:34:32


I will vocally advocate for a higher block cap when it becomes both necessary and manageable. Currently it is neither necessary nor manageable.

Which makes them worse than the miners in what way? They are literally only giving another option. Without LN you pay whatever the miners stipulate. With LN you can choose between paying the miners directly or paying any one of a whole host of LN operators. It creates a much larger market for transaction processing, bringing fees down considerably. In addition to lower fees, it also enables instantaneous transactions, whereas on-chain transactions will have to wait an average 10 minutes (or longer) no matter how high you raise the block cap.

You can't refer to all of China as "you guys", it's not polite.
In all seriousness, though, there's been a debate raging on for quite some time in the Bitcoin community. It's about the size of the blocks.
In the beginning, there was no block size limit. Each block could include as many transactions as necessary. Some people started flooding the network with spam transactions, overloading what few and paltry miners were participating at the time. The code was changed to implement a 1MB hard limit on block size. The problem is that 1MB blocks can only hold so many transactions, and in the past nine months or so, those 1MB blocks have been getting pretty full.
There have been various proposals to increase the carrying capacity of the Bitcoin network. The simplest and most straightforward is simply to raise the cap. The argument in favor of that is essentially that miners' hardware and internet connections are a lot more capable than they were six or so years ago when the 1MB cap was introduced, and therefore should be able to handle larger blocks. The Bitcoin core development team has summarily rejected this proposal and refused to implement such code. Several forks of the Bitcoin codebase - most notably Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT - have been born. These forks are currently compatible with the Core, but will hard-fork and branch off if a large enough portion of the miners adopt them.
Another proposal is the implementation of what is known as sidechains (also referred to as "lightning network"). Basically, the idea is that a bundle of coins can be sealed off from the main blockchain and then transacted in an isolated chain. These sidechain transactions do not need to be included in the main chain, and therefore do not contribute to filling the mainchain blocks. Once the sidechain has run its course, it can be merged back in. The biggest problem with this proposal is that the technology does not exist - the code has not been written and certainly has not been tested. The core developers by and large support this approach, and many of them are actually part of a company ("Blockstream") looking to develop this technology. Consequently, there are rampant accusations of core devs intentionally crippling the Bitcoin core (by not raising the block size cap) in order to force people into their own, proprietary solution to line their own pockets. Are these accusations true? Who knows?
Another proposal is what is known as Segregated Witness ("segwit"). It essentially doubles the capacity of each block by adding what could be explained as a second, parallel chain tied into the main chain. Each entire block in the secondary chain is verified essentially as on transaction in the main chain, meaning that you get 1MB main chain + 1MB parallel chain = 2MB total capacity per block. The convenient part of segwit is that due to the way in which its transactions are verified, some miners can choose to completely ignore it if they so choose and it will still work perfectly fine. The Segwit code was merged into Bitcoin Core a few days ago, and will be activated once enough miners adopt it.
Today's proposal concerns a large group of Chinese miners who have been meeting together to figure out what to do. Chinese miners represent a large portion of the total miners - I think it's because electricity is cheap in China or something. Today's proposal suggests that this large collection of Chinese miners (which represents a controlling majority of the hash power) has agreed to all switch over to Bitcoin Classic (2MB blocks) within thirty days. 28 days after that critical point has been reached (and maintained), the Classic blockchain would hard-fork away from the Core blockchain. Since the vast majority of the hash power would have switched over to Classic, the Classic chain would be the main chain, and the Core chain would fall away into obscurity. God knows what will happen to the price at the time of the fork (which is part of the reason that the Core team has tried to avoid it).
Today's proposal goes on to say that the Chinese miners will work to activate Segwit *after* the Classic fork has been reached. They then say that *after* both Classic and Segwit have been adopted, they will support further development of sidechains.
We'll all just sit tight and see what happens. Buckle your seatbelts for the rollercoaster.

Projecting much? The goal of most companies is to offer a product that people will want to continue to buy. Most companies do not prioritize single-sale profit over long-term revenue.


Price fixing is only profitable if there is nobody else undercutting your prices. Old companies colluding to artificially inflate prices creates a market opening for new companies to undercut them.

Yes, but they'll only get banned once they actually start sending the blocks, once the fork takes place. At that point, if your node is connected to a lot of 2X nodes, you'll suddenly be without most of your connections, as will everybody else in a similar situation. It will be a sudden blow to the interconnectedness of the Bitcoin node network. It would be better to avoid them well in advance so that the network isn't damaged at the time of the fork.

Currently new coins are generated an a fixed schedule - each new block (about every ten minutes) includes 12.5 new bitcoins awarded to the miner who generates the block. Once we reach 21 million blocks no new coins will be generated. From that point on, miners are paid solely via transaction fees (currently about 60 cents per transaction, but this is much higher than the historical average and much higher than future predictions).

Nano S has a display on the device itself so you don't need to trust the integrity of the computer into which you're plugging it in order to determine whether to confirm. The lack of display on the first-gen Nano opens it up to a couple of attacks:
* If you have any sort of PIN set up (as you should), you need to type it into the host computer, which could have a keylogger. The Nano S has you inputting your PIN directly into the device, not the host, securing it.
* On a Nano without the display, all of the transaction details are displayed on the host computer. An attacker could, in theory, construct an elaborate phishing attack that presents itself as one thing but in actuality is authorizing a completely different transaction. The display built into the Nano S enables it to display transaction details directly on the device, ensuring that you are looking at the correct information.

Transaction fees are high right now because the network has reached its maximum throughput capacity. There's a debate going on regarding how to solve this. One camp wants to raise the block cap; the other wants to activate segwit thereby enabling off-chain (but still secure) scaling. Once a solution is agreed upon the network will be less congested and the transaction fees will therefore fall back to a decent level.

It's been a few years since I set it up, but it should be pretty straightforward. Coinbase will ask for a routing number and an account number - these should be the same numbers that are printed on the bottom of your checks. (If it's not a checking account then you might have to contact the bank and ask about that.) Once you have provided those numbers, Coinbase will move a small amount of money between your bank account and theirs and then ask for you to tell them what that amount was (you'll have to check your bank statement or online banking); this is their way of verifying that the account number that you gave them is actually yours. Once you have verified ownership of the account, you will be able to buy and sell.

In short, scaling is a process, not one step. We can't just flip a switch and have all the capacity we'll ever need. However, SegWit+LN paves the way for future scaling; so, in a way, I would say that it will eventually be able to emulate VISA.

It's not 25.5 vs 49.5; it's 25% honest segwit miners + 25% attackers = 50% on the UASF chain vs 50% on the legacy chain. If the honest miners are any greater than 25% then the attackers will also need to be greater than 25%, meaning that the UASF chain has &gt;50% and the legacy chain has &lt;50%, so a reorg is possible.

The thing is, SegWit doesn't really have any value for LTC at this time, aside from enabling LNs, which aren't quite ready for a big showcase. LTC just doesn't have the volume to require it.

A few weeks is nothing. Adoption of any technology takes time. A lot of people are still using older versions of their wallets and other programs.

I'm not really sure of the details. I have no idea why they use different OSes, but I think I can explain the multiple languages.
1. Different markets and exchanges probably have different trading APIs in different languages.
2. Many more complex programs are coded in more than one language. Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, and a well-coded program may use different languages, each where appropriate. For example, a trading program may use one language for communicating with some trading API, another language for the main "brains" of the program, a third language for some graphics output, and a fourth for scripting.
