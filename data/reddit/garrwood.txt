Assuming you used the correct deposit address it just takes a while to credit. All exchanges are under heavy load with the growth - delays should be expected.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:37:02
Meh. I'm no expert by any means - no one is in such a 'new' market, but I've made money on both sides of 75% of these peaks, which is more than a majority of people on this sub can say. Holding is all fine and dandy until the trend flips 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:47:07
I agree. I didn't say anything one way or the other. It would serve you well to read prior comments.
Happy holidays, friendo.

What he said. It's nearly impossible to hold anything other than swing or long positions because you can't reliably trade. Nearly every exchange is experiencing trouble from the high volume, though.

@_date: 2017-12-23 05:35:59
Meh. I think it had to breach* 15.1 on that upswing for me to consider it a trend reversal. I think the bear market continues for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:07:20
The next 12 or so hours decide if this is a true head and shoulders reversal, or if it's just a dead cat bounce and we enter a prolonged bear market. Just my 2C.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:15:26
Logically speaking, the best time to buy BTC was $0.01
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:46:41
Like I said, I'm pretty sure breaking that last resistance near 15 was the last shot at a full reversal. Seems downward trend continues from here - at least that's what my positions are based on.

This was literally bound to happen with mass volume influx. If you want to use crypto as a fiat replacement, there are other coins in the space that play that role.

There's still good discussion, just not when the price goes on a wild swing rampage like the last week.
Also, "dumb memes" is subjective. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:13:36
So sell and keep your bitching to yourself.

It already tried to correct once and got us over 4k, and it refuses to stay under 4k mark for more than a few minutes. Going to be a long night regardless. Coffee* brewing haha
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:56:09
How low CAN it go? 0, technically. How low will it go? Hard to tell with ATH's as there are no real resistance levels established. Based on the orders currently in the books, I'd say somewhere around 3,500. This is the fun part.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:34:51

This is why I only automate when I absolutely have to.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:47:41
Or short small positions to reinvest more long-term, but what do I know anyway? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:09:28
Enter BTCUSD for most exchanges, or XBT for kraken. If you're European, EUR. 
I would read the whole thing 3x.

^ Unless you know what you're doing, the best bet, especially for a long-term investment like cryptos, is to dollar cost average and HODL. Things become cliched for a reason, and that advice being preached so frequently on here is not the exception to the rule.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:44:48
There are a ton of supports it would have to break through to get to 2000. One can dream, but we will never see those numbers again imo.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:52:20
Yup. People converted to FOMO buy the ATH hype and brought alt prices down. I just dumped more into ETH because of that as I'm sure others are doing as well. 
What a fucking fun few days it has been - even by BTC standard lmao
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:07:44
Not trading huge positions on big swings like this, so that helps a little haha.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:59:19
Had one margin trade set for the bounce off the support and then it crashed. Doubled down on that maaaassive support wall at 4150. Moments I live for right here.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:10:27
$300+ price drop in about 5 minutes with a big support catch in the $4100 area. Just people panic selling/sell walls.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:55:29
Perfect! Then I can 5x my profits again. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:58:28
We've already dipped past 4k three times - still trending up.

Right? lmao
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:39:34
Just hold and you'll be fine. These swings are normal. The overall trend is always up.
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:29:14
Kind of hard to record something like that. I've just been watching charts since 2013.
I could also be totally wrong - just something to keep in mind that I figured I'd put out there. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:04:41
4250 and 4130

The time to sell has passed imo, but it's basically throwing darts blindly right now. Don't gamble on large positions on moves like this, unless you are okay with your money being gone when you wake up tomorrow.

Frustrating as fuck. I stayed up all night trying to figure out how I could get in on that drop, went to work on 45 minutes of sleep. 
I tried switching my bank account to a new coinbase account, but it was saying my bank doesn't support instant verification (even though I had just done it the day before ha).

@_date: 2013-12-06 01:52:46
I am losing my mind not being able to buy while I wait for this first transaction to clear.
I should save myself the stress and stop watching the ticker...
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:07:08
At one point it was $850~. If I wasn't still waiting for my first transaction to go through I'd be investing as we speak. I think I'm going to miss out on this scare :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:58:18
Don't make uneducated purchases based on speculation - you will be disappointed 90% of the time.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:36:36
It's because there's so much inexperienced money in what is a pretty new concept. The person that invents a well designed, instant trading application will be a very rich man.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:01:48
First transaction should clear tomorrow, so next time the price drops to sub $950~ I'm buying in.
Edit: Damn. We're under $950 again.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:33:27
Only invest what you can afford to lose, OP! But don't worry, mad blowies will ensue in 2014.

Yo I fucking love Flume!
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:09:57
Yeah. China is a huge market so this whole roller coaster is just due to all the recent speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:06:52
The slight hiccup is a mix of the reaction from the Chinese government and the news of Baidu no longer accepting bitcoin.
Have faith.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:22:50
Yeah I would definitely be day trading on these swings if I wasn't using coinbase (4 day wait between transactions). Have any recommendations? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:08
The EXACT same thing happened to me yesterday. Thank god my funds cleared today and I was able to buy at $700~.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:40:51
Yes please, sell so I can buy cheap!
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:08:30
I have money invested for long-term goals, but this recent roller coaster in price screams easy profit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:56:09
95% of this sub. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:25:48
Missed my chance for the $850 dip this morning because of coinbase's bullshit rules on first transactions :(. Next crash, I'm going all-in.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:49:48
I feel as though it will drop, but nowhere near the low you are claiming. We were at $200~ before the speculation - it won't drop below that. I bought today at $820 in case of a rebound, but I'm saving my larger investment for the possible drop.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:56:48
