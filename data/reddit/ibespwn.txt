This might be one of the most level headed posts I've ever read on this subreddit.

Do your own research on the scaling debate. It's easy to lap up what they serve here, just as it's easy to lap up what they serve in the other subreddit.

It's a classic divide and conquer. Some groups are actively trying to divide the crypto community.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:51:18
Seriously? You read something that confirms your biases and just accept it as fact? Ridiculous. Do some research yourself, don't just eat what people spoon feed you.

Big blocker here, stoked to see competition in the market. Let's hold them to the open source release. Asics should be developed by tons of manufacturers to ensure no one monopolizes or centralizes.

This sort of action is what led to the split between subreddits. 
A predicted avoidance of the 2x part of the segwit2x plan and continued inaction on the part of Blockstream with respect to scaling led to the BCH fork.
Miners or others may be spamming the btc network to exacerbate the scaling issue bringing it to a head.
Censorship has caused the two sides to be pretty extremely divided.
I lean towards big blocks but am wary of the mining manufacturers (mostly Bitmain) gaining control. I'd like to see Blockstream out of the picture and several independent, competing teams producing implementations of Bitcoin and constantly vying for dominance. We need more game theory incentives, not fewer.

^ voice of reason here. Both sides are corrupt and terrifying.

Good call.

What governance does a non mining node provide?
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:02:42
Yes, I'm a small scale miner (have 1 s9 and some gpu miners with some more Asics on the way) based in the US. I'm not really solidly on either side of the debate, but it's clear external forces are dividing us on arbitrary lines. I question the truth of the claim that increased block size leads to centralization, though.
I actually think LN will fail due to a lack of adoption. If it worked, I could see the benefits, but I think US regulations will make it impossible for regular US citizens to be able to run their own LN service.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:22:44
That's validation, not governance. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:47:12
No spin? That's comedy gold right there.
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:01:55
No. No one would. No one is proposing it. It's a terrible idea, and if that's the irrational fear that drives you, it truthfully explains a lot.

If you're non mining, it doesn't have any meaningful impact on whether or not blocks propagate through the rest of the network. It only affects your node.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:36:03
Some parties control who is allowed to post perspectives in this forum and others control who can contribute code changes to the repository.
Many of the individuals and organizations I listed on both sides are granted way too much credibility for their position, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:17:38
And an exchange won't be affected significantly by increased block size leading to a slightly more expensive node.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:57:19
What are you implying?
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:19:48
Agreed. Both sides are ridiculous. Which is why it's obvious that we're being divided by external forces.

As long as people worship Blockstream, Craig W., Jihan, Gregory Maxwell, Theymos, and other celebrities in this space, fragility will always exist. Reject authority in all its forms.
