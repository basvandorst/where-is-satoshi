The velocity of BTC is obviously smaller than USD. But so what?
BTC is better than USD in some important ways; likewise USD is better than BTC in others. They are different tools for different jobs.

This is a silly argument; It begs the question "Why spend *any* money on *anything* when I could just buy bitcoin and watch its value increase? 
If you accept this argument then *all* currencies are infeasible so long as bitcoin is increasing in value.

Maybe Bitcoin was always this valuable and people were just slow to realise. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:43:21
The key word in that definition is 'exaggerated'. Was the promise of the internet in 1990 exaggerated? Or did the internet exceed expectations in many profound ways that were never thought possible? 
Consider the expectations of Bitcoin may not be exaggerated at all; possibly they're severely understated. In which case Bitcoin is hilariously undervalued. Even if you assume a 90% probability of failure Bitcoin may still be the bet of a lifetime.

No offence to Ian; his tool is fantastic but SSS is the wrong way to do this. It relies too heavily on non standard software, introduces risks such as keyloggers, malware and bitrot and the resulting shares are difficult to record. You want to use "one time pad" secret sharing as described here:  and here: 
It can be done with paper and pencil; thus your keys never touch a computer and like SSS is provably secure. Also the resulting shares are themselves mnemonics thus easy to record. It's just a better way.

You didn't read what I linked. The method described is *not* SSS; but One Time Pad.
OTP addresses all of your concerns. It's as easy as adding numbers and simple enough to describe in a will. Requires no software, computers or standards. Can be done entirely with paper and pencil. And far more secure than what you recommend.

DO NOT DO THIS. This method of sharding is not secure and vastly decreases the security of your wallet. I am embarrassed for hodlinox that they have recommended this method. Satoshi is rolling in his grave.
Taken from the bitcoin wiki: [Some people get the idea to split up their phrases. Storing 6 words in one location and the other 6 words in another location. This is a bad idea and should not be done, because if one set of 6 words is discovered then it becomes easier to bruteforce the rest of the phrase.](

This is exactly why Shamir Secret Sharing is not appropriate. Without a standard implementation it becomes very difficult to leave sound instructions for another individual to recover your seed. Explaining polynomial interpolation in your will is not a solution.
Instead I recommend the method described here:
It really is very simple; works well with 24 word mnemonics, is perfectly secure, can be done with paper and pencil and can be described in a simple recovery procedure. Don't split your seed as you have described; It will vastly decrease the security of your wallet!
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:03:32
**DO NOT SPLIT YOUR SEED INTO PIECES AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED!**
Instead use the method described here:

You could say the same thing about gold, stocks or real estate; but if Bitcoin is used as the store of value, Bitcoin *becomes* the cash, thus no problem.

Economists have long studied what properties an ideal currency would have, namely; divisibility, durability, fungibility, transportability, security and scarcity. Lots of things have been used as currency in history; salt, goats, grain, beads, shells, silver, gold, paper etc. and measured against those six valuable characteristics Bitcoin scores very high.. 
Thus: Bitcoin is an amazing currency with valuable characteristics that humans needed for centuries.

This is a poor argument. There are many many assets people hold that do not generate wealth. Gold, real estate, art, classic cars et. al. Do you have a problem with people holding these assets?
As for the costs of energy; Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts until the market reaches an equilibrium where the marginal transaction fee is equal to the energy required to verify the transaction. Nothing perverse here, just free market economics.

You won't 'instantly' wipe your account. You may not even notice your TREZOR is missing! Just because there are 'literally no reports' doesn't mean the device is 100% secure, there may be unreported thefts (or even unreported exploits) and if not there is always a first.
It's disingenuous to promote the TREZOR as the end-all-be-all of bitcoin security. There are *many* ways the device could be compromised from malicious employees to hard/soft bugs, fake devices, phishing attacks to outright GCHQ installed hardware backdoors in the Cortex M3. Not that the glacier protocol is perfect but IMO it does try to address the biggest flaw in TREZOR (or hardware wallets in general); that is I have to put my trust in a single entity (SatoshiLabs in this case), and $2.4 million is *a lot of trust*.

The last 30 years have been the most prosperous in human history; the trend cannot continue. Consider 10% apr has a doubling time of ~7 years. So your 35 years until retirement means 5 doublings or a increase of 32 times. Do you think the economy had room to grow 32x? Can Apple sell 32x more computers? Or British Airways fly 32x more planes? Or GM build 32x more cars? Or Exon pump 32x more oil? Or McDonalds sell 32x more Big Macs? If they do they will destroy our planet. There are limits to growth, arguably we have already reached them.

I see many problems with this scheme - it's far too complicated with numerous points of failure. USB keys are fallible, SSS is not standardized and susceptible to bit rot, random linux distributions and encryption softwares are untrustworthy and difficult to setup etc. For example "AES(Twofish(Serpent))" is a *terrible* idea. I get security in depth but it forces my heirs to maintain 3 pieces of software; any one of which could be bugged, unavailable or infected. Makes me wonder if I can trust Casa's service?
I would do it this way:
1. Use dice to generate seed.
2. Use a Raspberry Pi with Armory and a Trezor to generate addresses, in parallel, a la Glacier Protocol.
3. Use [One Time Pad]( to split the seed.
4. Use Cryptosteel or similar to record the shares.
Recovery is easier too:
1. Add dictionary indexes mod 2048 of two corresponding shares to recover seed.
2. Get a BIP39 standard compatible wallet.
3. Enter the seed.
Keep it simple!

Chargebacks are a big problem for certain businesses. For example the "Male Product Sector" (lol) has chargeback rates of 20%: 
And 1% of your sales is huge. Profits are maybe be 5-10% of sales so chargeback of *only* 1% could be 10% - 20% of your profits. Nothing to sneeze at.

Look at it this way; If you own 1BTC, that's 1/[16,351,763]( of all BTC today.
If you owned 1/16,351,763 of all the gold in the world:
[($8.2 * 10^12 )]( * (1 / 16,351,763) = $501,475
