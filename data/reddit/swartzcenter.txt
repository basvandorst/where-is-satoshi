I’m trying to withdraw IOTA. But I’m reading that many are having concerns with Bitfinex. And that many are worried they will lose their funds.

People are accusing Bitfinex of being associated with Tether hack. The CEO of Tether happens to be the CEO of Bitifinex...
In 2016, Bitifnex went under a DDoS attack and users lost 36% of their portfolios to pay for the losses.
I want to withdraw my funds.. It has been over 6 hours and it still says processing...

I’m not transferring to Fiat. 
What you’re saying is that I shouldn’t be concerned about the Bitfinex attack... and my funds will be fine. 
Yes or no?

Probably would be better if this started as an online store... store fronts in general are not doing well nowadays.

Buying bitcoin is a great investment vehicle for your future. 
While £10 may seem small to some it may be a lot of money for others. With that being said, it is important to make sure the amount of money you are using to invest is an amount you are willing to lose. 
The first thing you should do to get started is open up a Coinbase account and start the verification process.

Yeah. That’s probably the best play.

Depends where you work...
If you’re questioning it... it’s a hard no.

Don’t use Bitfinex. Their exchange is affiliated with the Tether hacks. Do some research before you send money there. It could take days to see it in your account.

What other products do you think would be good for a store front?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:14:19
Misread. My bad.

Use GDAX. It’s owned by Coinbase.

Good point. The notion of the dip is very psychologically based which makes me feel uneasy.

This happened to me when I got my iPhone X. Email the exchanges directly and ask them to disable your 2FA. 
They will ask for ID and proof of identity.

You sound like my grandpa. lmao
