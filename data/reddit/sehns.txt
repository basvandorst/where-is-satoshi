So by this logic, it would be justifiable for an American sharing a facebook video of Muhammed to be extradited to Syria?

And to top it off, the OP put the punchline in the title.

As someone who's lived in the US and Australia for many years I'd say the service in Australia is actually consistently better, there's none of that weird vibe you get where they are sizing you up on whether you're going to tip or not. edit: And not some ice queen the entire meal who suddenly becomes your best friend when the bill comes.

Its almost like the banks have had hundreds of years to develop a global network! Give crypto 10-20 more and I think we'll have something pretty good.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:25:21
Considering its a top 20 big cap coin, It goes without saying really.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:55:07
It might.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:25:22
You are missing the point. Coinbase does not have a resolution process. The email does not provide you with any options to make a case. You are simply told 'bad luck'. The point is, they need to have a procedure in place for legitimate customers to go the extra mile to verify themselves and mediate the risk. There is currently no such process. This, combined with the fact that they are basically making a profit by keeping your BTC when the market doubles during the 7 days pending, makes it very unjust.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:57:33
Coinbase if you're listening - Give us the option to use 2FA for every transfer.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:35:33
When I try to create a new account I get "an error occured, please refresh the page" - there's no way to refresh the page.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:07:33
Right - and I guess it's the banks fault that it takes 72 hours to get a response from support (if you're lucky to get any response at all) and all the other problems Coinbase is having.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:38:00
Finally, someone gets it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:41:28
I'd just buy more. At least i'd know I can buy without it being cancelled 7 days later.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:53:17
Yes, it would be a shame to see BTC become the Yahoo! Search of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:25:18
If they can resolve the resolution process on fraud ~~(which I know a lot about)~~ then it would be a great service.

No nutritional information :(
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:55:12
Can we all please get it out of our head that coinbase is some bootstrapping startup? 
They have $6.8 million in the bank, not including revenue and some of the biggest VC's behind them in Silicon Valley. They are a corporation. Their support is unacceptable. 500 emails a day could easily be handled by about 5 seats working a 24 hour shift.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:05:42
Yeah that poor multi million dollar company. Such a victim. In reality, it is dead simple to write up a bunch of training material (or have your existing support staff do it) for 90% of the enquiries, and hire an offshore support center to manage it. There is absolutely no good reason to have support take longer than 24 hours to get back to you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:14:42
I cant listen to that guy talk for more than 30 seconds without getting a headache. Shut the fuck up already.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:49:00
I respectfully disagree with your first point, extra technical information to the uneducated listener is going to spook them. 
However your example is solid because you're breaking it down into terms that people understand (relating the blockchain to a ledger, computer power ensuring accuracy, etc)
That being said when you are being interviewed in front of such a large audience its nerve wracking and quite difficult to keep your composure and your wits about you. I think OP did a great job.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:04:51
What banks are you using?
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:32:18
1. Then why was I not already called
2. Why is there no mention of this of the cancellation email
3. Why do I have to go onto reddit to find out this information from a guy called 16rjg4 with an attitude
4. Their support queues are backed up for days
5. Why are you being an asshole?
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:08:53
They have commented multiple times here in that they are hiring more staff. For Example: [Here](
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:11:57
Some questions for you:
- How many BTC did you purchase, at what price
- Was it a first time purchase
- Did you complete the extra identity verification steps
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:42:50
Great language you've got there. You're doing the Bitcoin community a real service.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:23:41
They cancelled the transaction 7 days after I had already completed the purchase and paid from my bank. They are negligent in the way they are performing their risk evaluations, as they are not giving the customer due process (or a case file) to prove their identity. Fraud is a big problem, but there is no recourse process for legitimate customers.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:51:32
Despite the massive circle-jerk thats going on in here, we should give them some credit where credit's due for actually giving you a warning. Pretty much every other bank out there just cancels your account and often doesn't even tell you why.
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:00:53
Like the public uproar about the last few wars? or the banks causing the financial crisis, bankrupting the poor and destroying the middle class? Those events impacted a lot more average americans than Bitcoin, causing a much larger response than we would see from bitcoin. And even then, government/big corporate didn't batter an eyelid. Public uproar doesn't work anymore. That's exactly why we need Bitcoin more than ever. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:39:15
You and the downvote brigade are right. This multi-million dollar all-star vc backed company doesn't need a resolution process for legit customers at all! Just go on reddit and use the search bar and hope you get lucky! Of course! I'm such an idiot! /s 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:46:23
Heh, you're right.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:48:27
FWIW, I have sent Coinbase an email with my drivers license and a long rant (which I am feeling a bit sheepish about now, actually) and I'm waiting for a response now.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:25:49
Yes. Nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:21:32
I realised that bitching about it wasn't going to solve anything, and realised that my anger was misguided. What i'd like to see is a more constructive push to get coinbase to improve for future use. As a community we need a reliable service that isn't the 'next paypal'.
Also, I got downvoted to oblivion. ;)

What you are describing is referred to in the industry as 'friendly fraud' - It's the real customer with his own credit card, but he then calls the bank and tells them that the charge on his statement is fraud. This can be circumvented a few ways. Friendly fraud makes up a small portion of ecommerce payment fraud - it's generally just people with stolen credit cards. I work in the CnP Fraud industry and if you'd like some free advice on how to help protect yourself against credit card fraud, send me a PM.

@_date: 2013-11-06 04:53:14
Ah perfect, thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:20:02
7 days.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:45:14
That would be nice, but as someone who works in fraud/security/risk i'm still in absolute disbelief they do not have the correct procedures in place for legitimate customers. It defies comprehension. I'm not the only person who has lost money because of this.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:47:28
I am worried my mail to support will go answered also.
It's one thing to not have a resolution system in place for high risk transactions, it's another to not return support requests for those customers. It's like twisting the knife.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:29:50
It will be refunded in a few days, but this is not the point. The point is that they do not provide due process for legitimate customers, and now I am out the $800 I would have gained from purchasing my bitcoin 7 days ago. I lost $800 because of coinbase, and they gained $800. Call it what you like.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:10:10
Yeah i've emailed them along with a scanned drivers license and waiting for a response.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:50:27
Amazing how you still get downvotes. This is a perfect example of what really pisses me off about Saying anything negative even if it is your own experience and adds to the conversation still gets downvotes. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:43:56
Fuck it, have an upvote.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:08:49
Shit I guess i'm the only one around here who expects a company with this amount of talent and money behind it to be able to figure out that 'scale' problem. It's not like they haven't had time or didn't see it coming.
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:19:53
heres what happened to me:
1. buy coins with coinbase
2. 7 days pending
3. bitcoin doubles
4. at the end of 7 days - transaction declined due to 'high risk'
5. go to reddit to complain
6. get downvoted to oblivion
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:51:58
Right, the messaging definitely doesn't help the situation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:59:50
Reduce fraud? Yeah that sounds good but is complete, utter bullshit. Bitcoin is powerful enough on its own merits, we don't need to start making shit up.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:59:22
How exactly is it unfair to blame Coinbase? They are responsible for their product and support, not the bank, not bitcoin, not you or me - why is there such a circlejerk for coinbase on here? This a company with $7mil VC backed behind them and they are valued in the hundreds of millions, if not a billion. Why does everyone on here give them a free pass for their shortcomings?
