For the moment Mistertango is the only one afaik that has native bitcoin support, another alternative is Revolut which has a bitcoin wallet but does not support yet depositing of Btc from your own wallet

Mistertango seems to be the only one working in the EU at the moment

If you are in Europe check my post history. I don't want to seem that i am promoting a service by posting it again and again

Not really the support but an official release from the dev team

If you pay 7 sat/byte is more than sure that it will be included in the next blocks. Average fee is higher because different wallets are still overestimating the required fee

THIS! most of the facebook ads about cryptocurrencies i've seen were clearly scams, i presonally see this as a good move, however some hr should be targeted towards cryptocurrency ads, and the legit ones to be allowed.

Mistertango has a working debit card and accepts Bitcoin deposits

China banned the 0 fee trades on cryptocurrency exchanges in late 2016. Until the begining of 2017 chinese websites had no trading fee at all so a lot of wash trades and volume generating trades happened.

The usual KYC/AML stuff like photo id/passport, proof of address

I am using both Revolut and Wirex, and i would recommend you to go with Wirex especially if you are from the UK. Revolut does not accepts deposits from BTC or any other cryptocurrency, but it is good if you are withdrawing fiat from exchanges. Wirex however is working absolutely well, accepting cryptocurrency deposits, there is no waiting list or delay, cards are ready to be shipped once you order them, also since you are from the UK you will get real debit card not a prepaid debit card.

Sure. What about the passphrase? In the image it can be clearly seen that the wallet is locked

You need to get your BTC private key from your blockchain wallet and import it into a USDT wallet
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:13:09
Wirex just added DebitCard purchase you need to be verified to do that though

Been using it for several months now and so far had no issues with them. Also you should take note that cryptoback is given only for in store purchases, when you pay with it online you don't get cryptoback.
Anyhow sorry to hear you having problems with it, hope it gets resolved soon
