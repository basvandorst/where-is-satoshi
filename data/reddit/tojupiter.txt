Another ideia: let the input be any field, and calculate everything else that's possible. 
This would let the reader have a better **visual understanding** of what it means for a step to be irreversible. 
Especially interesting to observe that encoding steps are reversible, such as obtaining an uncompressed private key from a compressed one, and vice-versa.

**Bounty Hunter**
People freely post ideas that they want to see implemented. Whoever posted an idea do not own it.
Visitors can freely downvote ideas (to get rid of spam), but can only upvote with their wallet - by sending btc to an address associated with that idea, at any amount they desire.
Whenever someone implements an idea, people can crowd-judge whether its btc prize already deserves to be taken.
This would attract a lot of btc from the broader bitcoin community into MIT-related projects.

Every university/school could be airdropped. People can donate any amount to specific entities. The funds donated are locked until: (and/or)






Biggest donors could add an image (e.g. the company's logo) to the Donors Page of that entity. Maybe only after the funds are released.

**Crypto-Wealth Race**
A Hall of Fame of the wealthiest crypto-portfolio to date amongst the airdropped undergrads, like those investment simulation competitions.
Everybody starts with the airdropped amount and let this site know when and how much they converted to other crypto. People can't change the history of their wealth, only tell the site at a certain moment that they have just converted coins. 
The site automatically tracks what their portfolio is worth at any given moment in the future. To be fairly accurate, it could calculate a weighted average from sites like cryptocoincharts.info.
There could be two categories:

**Show me love**
An easy and automatic way to associate people to public bitcoin addresses that only they will be able to withdraw from. An association which is not opt-in, but is "already there".
With this, people would be able to tip each other very easily. Someone you don't even know made a good point on a discussion in class and you think they deserve a tip? Now you can give them a tip for that, either anonymously or not, and they don't need to wear a QR-coded hat.
There could be a ranking of the biggest donation receivers and donation givers, a ranking of classes/situations where most donations happened, ...
If heavily adopted, it could become a recommendation tool, e.g. teachers that get lots of donations are probably the best ones. Any kind of in-campus decision-making could be aided by this tool.

it would be nice to have a radio button to alternate between the **compressed** and **uncompressed** formats (easily shown graphically, too).
This would make the tool more complete, and prevent some confusion from the fact that bitaddress.org generates addresses from uncompressed keys, and the default key format on brainwallet.org is also uncompressed.

Agreed! They'll issue more (with no USD backing) at some point, and shit's gonna hit the fan eventually.
It's not a cryptocurrency, it's an identified ledger (no user privacy) maintained by the central bank. 
It should be able to pick up some momentum, though. If the government decides to pay public workers with it, they might go ahead and circulate it instead of just insta-cashing out every month.

idea: **The rise of a tipping culture.** 
We'll watch the explosion of **frictionless microtransactions** in the next few years. People won't just "like" a post in facebook, youtube, 9gag, or upvote a post in reddit, but there will be tools to efortlessly attach a microdonation to each like/upvote action on the web.
What keeps people from microdonating to content they read/watched that was cool/funny/useful? One day, the main bottleneck preventing any microdonation from happening will be just the *intention* of donating. To me, that sounds like a good definition of *frictionless*.
When this culture of tipping gets mainstream, there will be a revolution on amateur content creation and many absurd ideas will become quite profitable. We'll see kids getting rich off a meme they created and got wildly popular. Or people being able to make a living from activities such as just being insightful on reddit on their areas of expertise.
I believe this tipping culture is showing its first steps here at reddit, and cryptocurrencies are definitely playing a role in it.

In Brazil people love to buy with credit cards because you can get a lot of frequent flyer miles this way.
The fees charged are much lower than 20%, I'd *guess* around 3% to 5%.
It's very common practice to get a 5% discount if you pay cash. Some merchants extend the discount for debit cards, but most of them keep it to just cash. Specially for small businesses, the cash discount is given to avoid paying taxes (so not just to avoid credit card fees).
Although there are a few online exchanges in Brazil (5, maybe?), Bitcoin here is still pretty much a speculative asset, and we're still very far from a wide adoption for commerce.

I don't buy the "I'm not a hoarder" BS. Why buy **now**, then? He even carefully wrote "I'**ve started** buying" pretending he's not actually trying to time the bottom. Of course he is, but by saying it this way it doesn't look like a bad bet if the price keeps going down ("see, I'm still buying...").
I guess he already bought (a lot!), or this blog post wouldn't make much sense. He sits on the board of some companies and needs to be transparent about whether he is an **investor** in the currency or not.
And enough of the "I really believe in the network/technology, but not in the currency" crap. They go hand in hand. He already knew that, and he was just waiting for a good buying price.

**A "We don't cash out" badge/seal**
... to be used by the businesses that accept bitcoin and try to either keep them or directly spend them to cover their costs (salaries, etc) without converting to USD.
Actively incentivizing this behavior might in the long run allow our first observable experience of fiat fading to a secondary role.

That fee is 1%, which is not huge. But I agree with you Abra should start with a much lower fee, and ideally **proportional to the teller fee** (eg a 25% cut of the teller fee, down to a minimum of 0.2% of the whole transaction). 
Allowing the holding/withdrawal of other liquid crypto (XMR and ETH) could also help on the goal of minimizing fees.

I don't think it does. the volume of eth-fiat is just too small. 
people coming back from eth to btc would only cause an increase in the fiat price of btc if the price of eth in fiat had some inertia (but it with a very small volume, it doesn't). This inertia would mean a correction in btc-eth would be absorbed in part by a btc-fiat correction and in part by a eth-fiat correction. But in fact, 100% of the btc-eth change is absorbed by a correction in eth-fiat.
When we get a lot of people turning their btc in fiat (after making a profit from eth-trading), then we even get the opposite effect: a (small?) decrease in btc in price in fiat.

Tether seems like a very good fit for Abra...
It would solve the volatility issue while still solving the "can't touch the customer's money" issue by storing the private keys to these tokens inside the app.
The user only sees fiat balances, and can use tether-integrated exchanges as outsourced KYC/AML links to the banking system.

I've watched the hearings. 
Coinfox summarized the article from Coindesk, which in turn based its article solely on JusBrasil's lousy job of summing up what was said during the hearings.
**What Rodrigues said is that he doesn't believe Bitcoin should be regulated *for now*, especially because when you do so you kind of give a stamp of approval on the technology being regulated. According to him regulation should come at some point, focusing on the intersection with the 'real' financial system -- i.e. over the exchanges.**
Brazilian politicians and regulators are light years behind in terms of understanding the technology and its ramifications. Even the main topic of whether to abolish cash was discussed at a frustratingly shallow level.
When it comes to AML and KYC there's a strong tendency in Brazil to just conform to international guidance. I foresee the country following suit on whatever gets decided in the US and Europe a couple of years later.

BTW, I have no idea if 'officialy declaring from a forum post' counts legally, but it reminds of this:

This means OKCoin believes shit will hit the fan, and their legal person or team advised them to 'officially declare' they are not involved in any way.
Authorities will come after complacent players, and this is a way to avoid legal trouble down the road. Besides, an eventual investigation of "how exchanges benefited from the scam" could end up revealing fake trade volumes, and so on.
