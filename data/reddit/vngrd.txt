I'm missing something? because I couldn't find anything about shrunken heads on Etsy
I could send that to someone, with a "proposition he couldn't resist"

Thank you kind stranger -  for your effort will not be for nothing.
Have a wonderful day while I work on becoming just a little better, each day.

5 years ago we didn't even have bitcoin, but someone found a way to make it a reality...

On BTCbeg the user u/SirEDCaLot siaid something I really liked:
"We need to reform the trust model involved with exchanges. Right now exchanges work as a black box. They say they hold coins in cold storage, they say they employ strong security, and we have to trust them at this.  There are ways for an exchange to prove solvency without compromising security. For example, if Gox had said "We are solvent- we are moving 700k coins from [wallet1] to [wallet2], just watch" and that transaction showed up on the blockchain, confidence would be INSTANTLY restored. There have been some math-heavy suggestions to do this without revealing the number of coins in question, and periodic accounting audits by trusted 3rd parties never hurt either.  The bottom line though is to prevent this from happening again, exchanges need to prove their own trustworthiness. Fortunately the major exchanges seem to understand that (see joint press release yesterday) and I look forward to seeing them implement it."

I'm always eager to learn - especially when it comes to grammar - please do tell me of my mistakes, because the auto corrector is clean on my side.

The post is not about how we're all going to live off of ramen from now on - its about how we can fix this, and make so that it wont happen in the future

Imagine a Kickstarter for Fringe science experiments , where they collect fund using bitcoins, that like the Future right there!

Thanks, should I give myself a Reddit silver?

Didn't Litecoin was supposed to be the "I'm Going To Build My Own cryptocurrency, With Blackjack and Hooker!" to the Good old Bitcoin?

We had quite an argument about this yesterday on r/bitcoinbeginners here:

Fiat money is still the status quote, on the other hand bitcoin is a new idea, and all those theft news make it seem like a big bad idea to simple minded (remind you - the wide demographic) people.

Always happy to see new faces, last week I've written short post exactly about how I started with bitcoins - check it : 
 tell me what do you think 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:52:34
I've written about it a few weeks ago : 
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:01:55
Because learning how to write is the reason why I started this whole thing. English is my third language, and I've decided to get my grammar and writing as best as I could. Than I figured maybe someone will be interested in what I'm writing about. Always happy to hear opinions - dont be shy
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:51:14
TIL what's Fiat money... shame on me
WikiBot! “fiat money”
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:00:10
It doesn't seem to help I've got to say, but again in bitcoin we don't have any kind of enforcement... 
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:08:01
Feel free to shoot me anyquestion here or on BitcoinRAVEN
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:11:00
I agree, more people should know about snapCard , especially those who still think that bitcoin is only good for pizzas and other coins
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:10:01
than again, in the end, in all boils down to the human factor
