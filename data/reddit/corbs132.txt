I just withdrew my balance after reading this, went through in less than ten minutes without a hitch. I guess at least if cryptsy's on the way out I don't need to worry about it.

Is there a non iphone way to do a bank transfer?

Excuse me, did you downvote me for adding to the discussion? Someone's a bit self righteous. 
I didn't say bitcoin couldn't provide for an adequate number of transactions per second, I said the litecoin could handle more. Which it can.
To add to that, transactions require less confirms, so money is transferred quicker.

it has an extremely fast confirmation time, so can handle more transactions per second.

This would be better titled "Adam Back joins Bitcointalk". This isn't anything special that he's stuck in newbies section.

serraz and kha0z are cool dudes, but i don't think they run btc-e. they are simply mods on the chatbox.

you can just withdraw your btc somewhere else

I'd love to use this, I just can't find hard numbers on it

Banning would be against why I like bitcoin in the first place. If you don't like him, downvote him.
