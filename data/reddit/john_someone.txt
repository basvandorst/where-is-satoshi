Does a restaurant care when 0.1% of customers double-spend the $20 they paid for a dinner? Not really, and the customer will probably find himself on a "Do not serve" list. Do I care when I buy $500 in BTC, in person? I do, and I really should wait for at least a couple confirmations.

Could you ELI12 tree chains, please? Almost all the talk nowadays is LN or sidechains.

This essentially collects the whole bill in one person's address, right? I'd imagine true shared payment would be collecting all the money in a multisig address, and paying the vendor from that.

Isn't LN just a gradual improvement over all the off-chain services? Basically the same thing - you commit some amount of BTC, somewhere off-chain stuff happens, and you can at any time get money back into your real-bitcoin wallet. But when LN goes on-line, you get all that without having to put unconditional trust into changetip operator. 
The changetip bot will be useful even then - just the underlying system gets some tweaks.

The patent OP is likely referring to: 
The present disclosure is directed to security settlement in financial markets and cryptographic currencies. Particular portions of the present disclosure are directed to a cryptographic currency protocol and to a cryptographic currency that includes a positional item. The cryptographic currency protocol supports a virtual wallet that, in various embodiments, is a security and cash account for storing and managing the cryptographic currency. Opening a transaction via the virtual wallet to transfer the cryptographic currency is a strong guarantee of the availability of funds in the virtual wallet because, e.g., funds are not transacted unless the commit phase is successful.
