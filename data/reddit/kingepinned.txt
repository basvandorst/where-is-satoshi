You are naive to think he bought 10,000 bitcoin specifically to buy a pizza. Im pretty sure this was a low percentage of the total he owned.

Sorry I can't help you with that :P. I use Multibit although there are better ways out there for longer storage like paper wallets.

1 out of 5 would consider using bitcoin then. The way it's word  makes it seem like a bad thing but that's decent considering public knowledge of bitcoin and its benefits are pretty low. Give it time

This insolvency thing is crazy. They dont owe anyone any ETC and that is all they lost.
They have never and will never support that coin.

Kudos to what you're doing, a good gesture to Bitcoin and the reddit community. 
However I'm sure some of the girls over at could do with a tip. More redditors may then surely reap the benefits of your billions when they all start shaking it for bitbills :D.
