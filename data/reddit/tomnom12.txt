hey you do you..

consider the worst case scenario here, your investment doesn't work out and you put yourself as a young person in a $35k debt to kickstart your life... I dont know your finances but if your saying you can pay this loan off then I would just invest what would be your weekly/fortnightly/monthly payment of this loan into bitcoin and accumulate btc that way.. the difference between doing it this way compared to taking the loan is if you sink $20k into btc and decide against it as an investment later on you can stop injecting your money into it.. if you have a loan it won't matter what you decide. you will still have to inject your income into paying that off.

.... for it to be not speculation you need to have facts backing you lol you cant just say i have no doubt because as i said thats a belief and fits the definition of speculation
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:18:17
I'm done trying to explain the difference.. what you just said clearly shows a strong belief which has blurred your vision.
btw id love for btc to have such a strong future, I just wouldn't call it investing.
@_date: 2019-02-03 04:19:00
thats literally speculation
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:44:59
I feel like these kind of comments are what drive people to exchanges like quadriqa.. like telling someone who has no idea to stay away from arguably the easiest and safest exchange because it goes against your beliefs and the fees are too high sounds kinda dumb when the other options out there are just plain risky which a new comer wouldnt know.

investing implies profit, speculating would be implying that btc will reach his desired goals with nothing else besides a belief.. this is specualting.. its not like there is a guarentee that btc will become so valuable that he can use it how hes envisioning

crypto is global, trump can only reach so far. Not to pretend that the strength of the US dollar/market (essentially what most of the world does foreign trade on) doesn't effect the crypto market but i dont think its anything close to the major trend setter.
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:55:45
i honestly won't care what btc does now. I made a nice dca purchase at $4k btc.. sure could of got a better price but honestly not worried short term.. if the bear eurphoria continues and we break below $3k I will have to simply see what I can afford when that rolls around
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:26:21
if you believe bakkt and wall street will 'kill the bear' then yes you are waiting on the US, but the rest of the world still goes on even if they dont.. personally I dont follow internal US politics so my opinion here is basically worth as much as bitconnect

if measuring by time, bitcoin needs to create a new low after said date
if neasuring by market cap I honestly don't know as I haven't checked numbers. So pick a side for longest bear market and back it with data, don't just repost some crypto media article.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:23:32
Heads up.. I don't live in america... couldn't care what your media reports. Also when talking finance, you should be fact checking because the last thing you want to do is follow the herd in such a high volatile, high risk market. I would love the title of surviving the longest bear market in crypto history but to get that title we need to go lower and I'm not even sure we will see that since all I see is everyone screaming for $1k - $2k bitcoin.. kinda sounds like the idiots preaching $50k - $100k bitcoin this time last year
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:44:11
very easy to argue bears are in euphoria.. especislly with a statement like that
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:49:25
2013 to 2015 is a measurement of time. you just claimed you were measuring bear market by market cap.. got numbers to prove 2013 to 2015 by market is still a comparible figure to the current bear market? 
@_date: 2019-01-26 07:13:16
I have seen a couple posts about surviving the longest bear market in history but it seems people seem to forget it has to actually do what you are saying for that to be true..
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:42:25
yes i must say i have enjoyed this thread hahaha big thanks
but yeah typically for me the longest bear is measured by time from ath to atl so yeah if 3150 or whatever it was, is the all time low for this season then we are done, i will obviously take that back when/if we break new lows
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:41:24
not sure a tax free currency in one country would do it, i think this is genuinely just bitcoin playing a game called "find my true value". No one knows what that is as there are many scenarios that point to extremely large valuations (like a btc backed currency or the currency pegged to trading btc against collapses) and many that point the other way.
honestly this is why the whole "invest what you can lose" thing works.. because you might lose it OR you might have stumbled upon the perfect hedge against the rest of your more 'traditional' investments.
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:53:43
are you comparing the 2014 bear market by market cap then? if so.. inflation adjusted.. nice
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:45:40
im saying the US wouldn't risk approving an etf by default and therefore would decline...
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:08:55
what you did do is assume a media outlet would report facts, and for this to be true btc needs to create new lows before this article you posted has any merit
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:33:09
ok I'm not familiar with who you are but now I feel like i should be hahaha
Speaker where? I'd be interested in watching that.
The only thing that became very apparent was the etf's proposals being withdrawn due to the shutdown. No government would default approve such a risk and therefore denying just for the sake of saving their own backside seemed so likely. Only made sense to withdraw and let this settle.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:02:06
assume two things here:
1. crypto markets are driven largely by specualtion (see previous comment of bitcoin playing find my true value) which essentially means the market is purely demand vs supply (ignoring any manipulation claims)
2. the platforms waiting to launch have to launch with sufficient liquidity meaning they have already bought. 
the way i see it is that unless bakkt and vaneck etfs majorly miscalculated the demand for the service they are about to launch (pushing buyers onto other means, otc or exchange) then the service they are meant to provide wont drive bitcoin out of a bear market.. it will merely just give bitcoin a tick of approval. Whether that tick has any impact I'm not sure.. again though I'm not savvy on how these large players work so my opinion here is worth nothing.. just an opinion
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:04:16
i never said it wasn't the longest bear market.. just asking you to stick to the facts.. as i said i have no idea what the market cap looked like for btc during 2013 and 2015.. you are the who mentioned market cap
if you are measuring by time then bitcoin needs to break its current low for this bear market for said article to be true
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:58:48
yeah the volume is what I'm looking at too, although I have seen a couple OTC desks say they do struggle to fill their buy orders sometimes.. again that could be fabricated to create demand so I remain patient for volume on usd exchanges not usdt
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:13:34
if you are taking stats from highest high to lowest low and btc doesnt create a newer low is your statement still true
