Both those companies contribute to degradation of society and are as guilty as some of the big banks for ruining people’s lives. 
If bitcoin pushes a long term transition to smaller, local businesses because Walmart can’t afford the transaction fees with their ridiculous low margins, good. 
Of course this is unlikely, but a guy can dream.

Sorry, that might have been confusing. 
I wasn't saying it would go to 8.5k. I was saying that it will dip, there will be a correction. Like the small one we just had after the 20k spike. 
BUT! In the log term the smartest thing to do is to hold. After any correction there should be a more normalized sustainable growth period.

Memes aside.... Hodl.
Remember when It "crashed" back down to 8.5k? Yeah, that was less than a week ago. You can't time the market.

This is not fake news. 
This is just an opinion piece with people who do not believe bitcoin is what those in the community believe it is.

This is entirely too good.

Fake news is propaganda designed to purposely mislead and manipulate the consumer. 
Poor reporting is not knowing anything about the topic you are reporting on and saying incorrect things.
Not everything is fake news. Not all media comes from a place of malicious intent. Sometimes people are wrong, and we should be more accepting to those who are wrong. Yelling at them for how stupid or ignorant they are is not productive.

**That** is the long term you need to think about. 
Think about the people that sold as it started to crash back then. Do you think they are happy with their decision today? 
I hope it crashes hard. Down to 5k or something. I'm buying more if it does.

I came here to ask this. Trading volume has skyrocketed.
Gdax is even lagging.
And.... literally as I type this it jumps $300

I would say this is a bad idea. 
You don’t want to be involved in other people’s money. It gets messy and ruins friendships. 
The best thing is to point them in the direction of learning themselves. 
You especially don’t want to be involved in family members’ money. It tears families apart.
