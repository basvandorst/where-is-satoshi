How would the IRS have any idea if you spent them?

Except by our President of course. Tax evasion "makes you smart".

This dang dial up internet takes too long. This internet thing is never going to catch on!

Pretty unfair way of doing comparisons. Btc market cap is still ~20% of JPM's. For now.

Probably just wait. Coinbase not only charges you high fees for using a CC, but they also make you pay an above-market price for the BTC. Not really worth it when you can do it for free on GDAX.
But don't get mad at me if BTC runs back up to $5000 over the next few days. No one really knows what is gonna happen with the price.

It's much easier and would also let people invest in it with their 401k's

Buying directly from Coinbase has crazy fees. You should instead deposit USD to Coinbase and transfer it to GDAX (the exchange that Coinbase is using). Once it's on GDAX, you can place market buy orders and pay a 0.5% fee, or place limit buy orders and pay no fees. It takes like a week to get the money from your bank account to GDAX, but once it's there you can buy BTC with zero fees.
The only fees you get will be the transaction fees you get by sending bitcoin to your wallet, which should be minimal.

This makes sense, but is there any proof to GS already being in bitcoin?

Not really "simple as that". Companies can price shares at whatever the hell they want. The underlying market cap is what matters.

My bad. $28.5M/pizza still good value.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:15:29
I wouldn't blindly buy a share in 2 companies without knowing what the underlying market caps were first

The solution is to obviously never sell

What's wrong with google news? You can tweak the settings and block certain sources and set some sources as preferred.

You can deposit directly to GDAX it doesn't matter. GDAX and Coinbase are linked and it works the same for both of them.
A market order is where you buy the lowest available sell price. A limit order is where you offer to buy at a price below the lowest available sell price. E.g. the lowest Bitcoin sell order is $3874.11 and you offer to buy at $3874.10 and then wait for that order to get filled. The price is constantly fluctuating so a limit order just below market price should be filled quickly.

It will continue to crash and shoot back up, but barring any major technical issue or major govt intervention every crash should continue to be smaller (% wise) than the one before it.

Yup. People say the same stuff every time a world changing technology comes out.
When electricity became a thing, people said it was too dangerous and too expensive to install. Gas lamps worked just fine. Everytime a fire started because of electricity newspapers covered it and spread fear.
When cars became a thing, people said they were too slow, too dangerous, too impractical with dirt roads and gas stations being rare/expensive. Horses worked just fine. Everytime a car fatality happened newspapers covered it and spread fear.
Same story different decade.

Not yet in the US. But I'd recommend buying BTC now because the price of BTC will skyrocket once an ETF is approved.

This sounds like a lot but he got two pizzas so it was only $23.5M per pizza. A steal if you ask me

Getting above a trillion dollar cap won't be easy and definitely won't be happening "soon". This is 5-10 years in the future minimum. If ever.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:59:40
Yeah, seriously. If he's a troll making shit up to hurt the value of bitcoin he needs to be IP banned asap

Here is a medium article explaining the technical aspects of Bitcoin. It's the simplest and easiest to understand explanation I've come across. Some of you might find it useful:
