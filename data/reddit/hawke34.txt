A Turing complete decentralized state machine has hundreds of use cases. And many of those use cases require tokenization.
Ladies and gentlemen, the naivety of a maximalist on full display.

Definitely, 92% of the token market is ETH based... ERC is the future standard of these types of assets. Ethereum Enterprise Alliance is foaming at the mouth to standardize this (but must implement Plasma first)

Bitcoin isn't the largest actually -- Eth has 1.4x the nodes (probably due to higher mining reward atm). Security though BTC is best (but it's a tradeoff with scalability).

You realize the two are linked, right? ICOs help bring publicity to BTC and vice versa. People here who think Bitcoins fate is separate from the entire emerging global blockchain industry are pretty damn delusional.
People here acting negatively about ICOs and altcoins are part of the problem.

VC startup numbers are just as bad failure wise. Why would blockchain be any different?

This isn't true. The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit, global open-source organization. Vitalik is one member of a team of developers that evaluate EIPs together.
Stop spreading lies.

Interoperable virtual state machines. Think WAN/AION/ICON alliance type standards applied cross chain. There's also Polkadot/Cosmos/Ark style bridges that do the trick.
I'm guessing the EVM will probably handle most of the under the hood top state level smart contract work given its speed and architectural decentralization (and the application of endogenous/exogeneous sidechains + second layer scaling solutions).
BTC will still be used ofc be used but it's not really built the same way as these other chains.
