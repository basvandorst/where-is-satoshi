If you're in Gauteng (South Africa), there is an ATM in Midrand...

Not sure if it is related, but I noticed a while ago (2-3 weeks) that the 'regular' sellers on localbitcoins.com of BTC for ZAR have all but disappeared. Previously, it was possible to exchange ZAR for BTC quite easily (at a premium, admittedly) using cash deposits, but as of a few weeks ago, those traders seem to have been replaced by ones seeking Moneygram or Western Union transfers, or if they do accept cash deposits, you are now expected to agree to conditions like this:


* DO NOT START A TRADE WITH ME UNLESS YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED MY TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TRADE, WHICH YOU CAN FIND BELOW.
* I will NOT trade with you unless you can provide me with your full name and surname as per your I.D. Document, and your cellphone number that has been RICA’ed in your name.
* If you are involved in any illegal/fraudulent/criminal activities, do not initiate a trade with me, I know all the scams as I have worked for the police and I am in direct contact with the fraud departments of all the banks. I will report you to the police and localbitcoins.com.
* you are confirming that you are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms and Conditions
* I will NOT trade with you unless you can provide me with your full name and surname as per your I.D. Document, and your cellphone number that has been RICA’ed in your name. This is a common practice followed by professional bitcoin traders to prevent fraud and money laundering.
* you agree only to trade with legally obtained funds that belong to you
* you confirm that you are not taking part in any fraudulent activities, money laundering or any other illegal activities by transacting with me and that you are not involving me in any fraudulent activities, money laundering or any other illegal activities by transacting with me on localbitcoins.com
* you agree to take full responsibility for your transactions with me
* you confirm the details provided upon registration with localbitcoins.com are true and accurate
* you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of localbitcoins.com and any local, national and relevant laws when entering into a transaction with me on localbitcoins.com.
* if you involve me in any fraudulent or illegal activities, I will open a case of fraud against you with the police, I will provide both the police and localbitcoins.com with all your contact details, including your I.P address, I will inform localbitcoins.com that you have involved me in fraudulent activities, and I will assist all relevant parties, e.g. Banks, in making sure that you will be prosecuted.
* I reserve the right to:
o Request proof of your identity, Photo of you holding you Passport. I.D. or Driver’s License. (No edit of the pic) so that I can see you and your face on your ID.
o Insist that your bank account name must match your identity document. If I find the payee’s name does not match your real name, you will be reported immediately and the trade will be cancelled
**TL;DR** It has become significantly more difficult to buy BTC with ZAR in South Africa lately - especially (anonymously) with cash.
