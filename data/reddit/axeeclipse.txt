Probably coinbase since they have a track record of selling out

They're all in on it. These "whales" are them. We just have to be strong to defeat them. Only as strong as the weakest hand
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:29:34
Mine are in a/c and not at max capacity.  I treat my workers good.... even offer health, dental and a 401k.

The EXACT reason why we  buy 
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:34:12
That's was for cryptoz
@_date: 2018-08-26 04:28:45
You should stick to cryptos

I gotta get them to use my LN nodes lol
@_date: 2019-03-04 00:14:35
Catching up to the node count for skycoin
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:28:46
In fact....I have a LN node haha so I would say I'm biased towards Bitcoin for achieving the point of sale goal.  But if Graft succeeds as well itll also help out BTC and other coins for more adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:41:32
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:27:45
I see some skycoin in there :D
@_date: 2019-03-02 00:52:26
My last conversation with them was in August last year I believe.  Last I heard they were contacting the graft team about it. I also forwarded information to the team as well.  What they have or are doing with that I have no idea.
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:47:51
Look up the Graft Newtork
@_date: 2019-03-01 22:56:08
I've been in contact with Kroger corporate since I first heard of them complaining about the high Visa fees. I've been in contact with them since last May. They are interested in the Graft network at the moment which utilizes their existing POS systems (Verifone) . I am not affiliated with the Graft team though. So we shall see how this all plays out. BUT they definitely  wish to cut ties with Visa in the future.
@_date: 2019-03-01 01:52:50
My Dad says crypto is about pump and dumps and it's all smoke and mirrors. Hardcore gold fanatic. I dont have anything to owning physical gold though......but crypto is not smoke and mirrors IMO
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:14:21
Finally....someone speaks the truth
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:26:13
Idk where you get that info but the team is still working on the project. Verifone has also recently verified they are still partnered with Graft as well.  I have no skin in the game, I dont own any graft, but i cant let you go on and spew out incorrect information. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:36:22
Graft will be Visa's doom hopefully 
@_date: 2018-10-26 22:00:57
Lemme guess.....your girl didnt win
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:10:49
In Texas we had a case of a no knock raid on a wrong house. Home owner shot and killed a cop, and it was justified as self defense.  Results may vary

Shoudl try out CX for graphics design
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:49:46
Graft will be using Verifone and Ingenico. No need to buy a different terminal.
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:57:35
I have the same 5.11 pack ya got
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:56:06
I figured :/
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:44:43
Insert the Graft Network  ;)
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:12:59
Crypto wont be spent until an easy means of spending (product and govt regulations) favor using crypto. Projects like Graft and the like are working on that as we speak. Verifone and Ingenico are on board waiting to bring crypto acceptance to every type of retail (brick &amp; motor and online stores).
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:10:08
Hope theres space by the $ sign for a - sign
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:01:09
Did you see that blur pass over your head?........well that was the joke
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:31:27
Once Graft gets going,  it will solve all the crypto payment issues. Bitcoin will be its first crypto on the network for payments along with the actual graft coin. Then eventually every crypto asset will be able to be used.

Someone had to make that car, someone has to help refine his gas, make his tires, import the vehicle ect....his insurance company is enjoying a nice premium........now he is supporting a local business owner that pays his/her waiter/waitresses salary....I'd say hes contributing well to the economy.
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:26:47
Wait until the Graft Network is up and running in a couple months. Be able to use current POS terminals as well as a card and NFC ect
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:48:50
Graft Network will allow anyone with the verifone or ingenico POS terminals to accept bitcoin. Also they are going to be implemented in online payments systems as well. Exciting times ahead. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:27:18
Anyones BTC deposits SLOW AF? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:20:35
Are they partnered with verifone or ingenico? That's what separates that from Graft because Graft IS exclusively partnered with them.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:52:41
Yup....best project in the space right now!
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:40:59
