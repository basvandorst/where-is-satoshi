Yeah nice set-up! Well done 
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:18:17
Yeah probably wouldn’t quite meet Australian standards!
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:41:28
Will be interesting to see how that one plays out.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:33:37
Nobody  like argue with that!

Veeeeeryyyyy niiiiceeee!
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:42:23
Wow. Does anyone know if this footage has been verified?
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:47:03
That's a rumour - Facebook won't say what it's doing. But one thing is clear - they aren't ignoring blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-08-28 10:28:25
Interesting reading! Google trends historically a good indicator of price movement.
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:04:30
He joined the board last December. So yes he has left very quickly. Could be for any number of reasons though.. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 11:51:09
Wishful thinking, but you never know!
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:28:24
Sorry guys, I posted this without a link earlier. Let's try that again!

Google “police seize bitcoin”. There are many examples across the world of authorities seizing bitcoin as proceeds of crime.

I am still trying to work out if Robert Kiyosaki owns Bitcoin. In one interview he said he owns 5BTC, then in another (which seems to have been done since) he said he only owns Ethereum and Ripple. If anyone can help clarify this it'd be appreciated!

Does anyone know where we can read more about this?
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:46:31
Strong, simple message. I like it.
@_date: 2019-03-13 10:21:07
@_date: 2018-10-29 20:26:24
That’s always a wise thing to do
@_date: 2018-10-09 05:28:23
The prices are in Australian dollars!
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:31:23
The word conspiracy wasn’t added by Micky, for the record. It was used to describe the video segment the article is based on.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:15:57
Sounds like ShapeShift lost a lot of fans over KYC 
@_date: 2018-10-09 03:20:47
We'll know tomorrow ;)
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:44:59
If you read the article you will actually see divide the doco will explore is between the world’s crypto ‘pioneers’ and the bankers who are now starting to move in. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 05:41:06
Given that I wrote the article, I may have to disagree with you on point a.
As for “pure speculation” ... Have you actually read the article? It poses a question without speculating at all! It just runs trough the points raised in the 1988 article. It’s up to the reader to take out of it what they will.
I feel you have jumped to outrage, without giving any thought or consideration. Your use of the word “trash” was typical of the trolling age. Disappointing.
Your final point, about the original cover having “8026” on the coin is interesting, and I am looking into it. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 10:03:47
This may be true, but Digital Surge shouldn’t be singled out. Most existing exchanges ask for more ID than Digital Surge.
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:33:00
@_date: 2018-10-21 05:33:09
What are everyone’s thoughts on this?
@_date: 2018-10-09 04:55:30
Nobody really knows I guess...
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:36:39
Digital iD requires licence input. 
Most crypto exchanges require that AND a selfie
@_date: 2018-10-21 06:18:14
So you don’t believe any of the theories?
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:59:06
Fair enough 
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:51:02
Yeah, possible
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:31:25
Don’t be like that Turtle man.
@_date: 2018-10-09 05:56:14
Yes. That does appear to be a key difference. A better version has evolved!
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:56:00
Thanks for letting us know! I can find you a prize if you like?
@_date: 2018-10-09 06:45:04
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:29:54
What makes you say that??
@_date: 2018-10-09 04:08:51
Yes, you're right. It certainly isn't inaccurate.
@_date: 2018-10-09 04:54:06
Trash? It’s reference to an article that predicted a global currency 30 years ago. It’s interesting. Love it how everyone’s first instinct is to troll.
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:32:24
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:30:49
Well, yeah, that’d be nice bro.
@_date: 2018-10-21 06:07:33
Wasn’t meant to be satirical.

A couple of young lads having a crack!

Wozniak and Jobs seemed to have had a very simple business model - Profits will come if you make things that make life easier for people. In the full interview he says that's the key to mass adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. M.

You tell us...? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:15:54
We write for an Australian audience primarily, so left "Australia" out the headline. You're right though, we probably should specify, especially when posting in a global forum. 
Your feedback about our name has been taken on board. However, we feel it is our job to make "micky" become a trusted name in crypto news. There are hundreds of websites with the name "coin" and "crypto"... We are going to be unique, for better or worse. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 06:10:00
Hey guys - it has been brought to my attention by another redditor that the image on this Economist front page has been doctored so that the coin says “2018”
Can anyone help confirm this?
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:57:06
Didn't they just get a licensed crypto exchange in the region?
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:53:51
This is probably not surprising given you can invest $10 in Bitcoin, but you can't invest $10 in UK real estate.
It will be interesting to see if this changes, with the tokenisation of assets. 
Eventually, you could essentially be investing in BOTH crypto and real estate at the same time. This is probably possible already. Does anybody know of any examples?
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:42:09
Well aren’t you a lovely chap.
@_date: 2019-02-23 23:34:56
If you read the article it talks about how purchases wouldn’t have been made on exchanges.
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:17:22
Keep trolling, legend.
@_date: 2019-02-26 09:36:42
Wrong. The Bitcoin mining game was introduced a few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:29:55
Congrats :) If you're in the US, I'd hodl that BTC if possible. When you convert it to USD, it's a taxable transaction - 25% capital gains tax, iirc (I'm not a tax pro, so take that for what its worth).
@_date: 2019-04-26 06:05:47
Did you read the word ALLEGEDLY? This kind of posting really irks me.
@_date: 2019-04-26 06:06:19
Yep. That's because it was posted in Australia.
@_date: 2018-11-01 11:49:49
Welcome your comments on this guys. It’s a massive call!
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:22:17
I think Pomp has tweeted a link on his Twitter account. I’ll have a look 
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:48:41
Excellent question. It’s an ETP,  and there is a difference. We are working on an article to explain this after clarification from the product provider. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-11-05 13:06:58

@_date: 2018-11-01 11:57:17
I think there’s a lot of people who hope you’re right! (And probably a lot who hope you aren’t)
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:28:26
I notice you've commented on a few our posts. Email [admin if you have any issues. Your comments about Vladislav Ginko are completely untrue. As I said on a previous post you commented on, feel free to contact any of our sources yourself if you have doubts.

Yeah I don’t think you’re alone on that one

Interesting take
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:45:26
Hey. Appreciate you reading and responding. We like to think the headline wasn't misleading and hope the finer details were explained in the body of the story. Regards - Ed
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:56:56
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:21:28
Yes, that probably should have been mentioned. Apologies - Ed.

But they really are this time ;-)
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:00:17
Hey mate. An image in the article shows it is the most read article on the Time website, but we should also have mentioned the social media traffic. Fair criticism! Will take on board.
