Anybody with concrete answers?

Some more questions :) Thanks in advance to all, who can contribute to a clearance of the things:
a: There are fees for every movement of coins. Buying, putting to the wallet to be safe, putting back to a market to be able to sell, selling. In all steps there are considerable fees. What is the best way to handle it?
b: Which is the best wallet, in which I can store btc, eth and different altcoins at the same time? (for now I own only a little less than 7 eth, so a hardware wallet seems a bit expensive. And what, when I would have one and loose it -&gt; everything gone)
c: When I buy at lets say 20:00 and there is a backlog and my transaction is processed at 22:00, do I get the course of 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock?
d: When I buy on Coinbase, I buy FROM Coinbase, right? (Like from the bank). When I buy on poloniex or bittrex I buy ON the market-plattform from a private person, is that right?
If so, speculating with a skyrocketing altcoin could be dangerous, because in the end there would be noone to buy it. But with btc or eth this danger is nonexistent, because of institutions like Coinbase, who even buy at the highest price, right?

Is the price changing according to the bitcoin-course every 10 minutes or how does it work?

Thank you! Some things start to clear up.
I have a bunch of blurry questions left for the next days :)

Moving from Coinbase to Kraken?!
Do I first need to change all my cryptomoney to fiatmoney, transfer that fiatmoney to my bank account and than again put fiatmoney by sepa to Kraken and buy cryptos?
Or how does that work? 
As you see, I am a bloddy beginner, but already annoyed by Coinbase being down whenever I want to do something...

Do you mean like if Coinbase goes down and loses my coins stored there? How would that be possible? In my farmers logic I hold and posess  them until sell them. Is this thought wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:36:31
To which ones?
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:32:50
Where did you buy golem and the others? On coinbase it is not possible.

How do you do limit orders on polo?
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:56:03
Why is that. I give them money and they give crypto. They just store it, like a bank I thought.
Ok, how can I take cryptos down from Coinbase? ( I am really embarrassed to ask this fundamental question)

Ok. Just didn't figure it out yet. I am an illiterate un those things and barely start to grasp the whole blockchain-thing, the bitcoin, the altcoins and the respective technologies behind them. Trading is yet also tricky for me. :/ What is my private key, how to send coins, how to place orders, how to store my coins, how to use other blockchains than coinbase, where to find less commission than there, etc.... ui...
