Good points. I have to reassess my setup, never assumed I would NOT remember my 24 word seed for any reason but like you say you cannot tell with health and memory when it might fail a person these days.

You dont make a permanent physical backup, you just memorize it and burn the written down seed. Its not really difficult memorizing 24 words, thats about the first thing I did years ago when I got in to crypto. Choose a easy mnemonic to remember it if you need. (this is the point you miss) 
Airgapped computers still expose the seed, yes its safer than non airgapped computers but still susceptible to a host of other social engineering attacks like someone bugging the airgap PC, someone watching from behind, etc. You have to constantly access the airgap PC each time you want to access your coins which increases the surface area of the attack. Whereas with hardware wallet you just need to create the wallet and memorize the seed once and you are done. 
The very existence of a paper wallet (i.e keys on a bit of paper) is super insecure and prone to a host of attack vectors.

A hardware wallet like ledger ensures your private keys never leave the device or are known to anyone else. This is a big difference that literally helps me sleep better at night. I have heard a first hand story from a mate who got hacked with funds on his computer electrum and it set him back several years in life and the worst part is he is still not sure what led to him being compromised.  
Paper wallet can never allow that level of security. 
On a ledger you can even create decoy accounts if you are really paranoid so even if you are forced to give up the pin you can send the attacker into a fake wallet. 
There is really nothing more secure than a hardware wallet + memorising the seed words.
