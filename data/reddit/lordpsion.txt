I run my full node off a very small [utilite linux box](

I tried to link a bank account over 2 weeks ago. After 10 days I still didn't see the deposits in my account so I sent circle and email. They got the deposits in that afternoon and I was able to link my account.
Send them an email...you are probably in the same boat.

Yeah, I attempted to put armory on a different port and it did not like it. Then I thought to switch bitcoin-qt to a different port an it would only accept up to about 18 connections, as opposed to 60+ on the standard port.
Oh well, I just run armory once a week to keep the chain up to date. No biggie to reset the router then.

I have an ubuntu workstation running bitcoin-qt on port 8333. I also have a windows box where I run armory for my wallet. Port 8333 is forwarded to the ubuntu box on my router. My full node works fine until I open Armory on the windows box. Somehow Armory screws with the NAT table in the router and steals the 8333 redirection therefore making my full node no longer visible to the outside world until I bump the router.
Basically, Armory is doing some strange stuff. May just be the competing full node client.

This is a fantastic write-up. I would really like to read a similar account from the bcash side. I know that side has enthusiastic advocates as well that could try to describe the situation in a similar manner from their perspective.

This is interesting. Doesn't this present double taxing on the crypto though? If you have to claim it as income, it is taxed initially. Then when you sell it, you have to pay capital gains on the sale.
This doesn't quite make sense to me. If I were to compare it to fiat income. I get taxed on the income initially, however when I exchange fiat for anything else I don't have to pay tax on it again (aside from sales tax charged when I purchase something).

I would say that if you want to actually add value and resale possibility to your home then install a proper central heating system. I am not certain, but I would think that mining equipment isn't going to add any value to your home since it is removable.
