Shit I hope the wallet inspector doesn't find me

I feel like out of all alts it has has the most potential. I've kept it at like 15 percent of my portfolio.

No this is Patrick

Thanks man, it took a solid 4 years to build up but I'm pretty stoked with it. Tons of my friends have scores in the mid 400s so it feels good to know I'm ahead of the pack in that department. 
But yeah exactly, it's not like it's financially paining me to carry the balance and I'm on the brink of starving or something, there's just something so mentally painful about giving ~80 bucks a month to a bank for using money I have already if I pressed that sell button.
Idk what I'll do, I have a week or two before my due date comes up so I have some time to think.

Good morning from Jordan

Lmao some of the comments in here remind me of the 2018 crash. Anyone who is panicking needs to chill their tits. If you feel like you're overextended, sell enough to make yourself feel comfortable because this price action is gonna keep happening in the future. Otherwise, maybe stop looking at the price and do something else.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:18:08
Depends on what percentage btc you have and what percentage stock you have relative to your net worth. I'm one third stock, one third crypto, one third high interest cash accounts. I like it that way, seems to be a good balance of risk and reward.

por que no los dos?

ah okay. I though you were selling drugs lmao
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:39:35
Wow who'd have thunk, one of the most volatile assets is being...volatile. All while heading in a clear upwards trend.  
If these kinds of price swings make you angry, anxious, or upset you're either way over invested (mentally or financially), have nothing else to do with your time, are a kid, or a mix of the three.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:50:06
perhaps one of the biggest would be posting about it on a public forum.

Do you have a checking account dog? If you do its not that hard to set up an account on an exchange and go at it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:24:56
yeah fml lol.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:47:37
I cashed out around half that with my bank (USAA) and nothing happened to me.

Any time man
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:26:59
Thanks man, this really helps to put things into perspective.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:12:18
Very good point, the interest is real while the gains are on paper
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:49:42
damn this is lowkey intense

Bro this is small potatoes

9 AM where I'm at. Gonna be a good day.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:40:40
Eh, doubt it. Pretty sure we're gonna cool off for the next few days before another big step up or down.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:18:54
No but it got damn close, and we haven't hit 10k yet so the comment still stands.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:47:29
First/business is only worth it on long flights/premium airlines. I flew business class on one of emirates 777s and it was amazing. Full reclining chair, cocktails made to order, steak that rivals nice steak houses, your own personal flight attendant. 10/10 would recommend.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:56:37
I'm getting ready to sell like 4 percent of my BTC stack and convert all my alts, I've made more in the past week than I did over the past year. I rode eth up from 40 dollars to 1400 then slowly down to the earths core. 
Hated/hate myself for not selling, not gonna fuck up again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:33:48
Iran isn't a "terrorist regime". Its a dictatorship with hardly any respect for human rights, sure, but its not a "terrorist regime".
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:09:57
Just like December of 17 was the last time we'd see it under 20K lmao
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:26:20
Yeah I always pay it on time to avoid that 50 dollar late penalty. I'm just in between having graduated college and looking for a job so I don't have a source of income besides ~250 dollars a month of stock dividends. 
I guess theres a balance with everything, I think I'm just going to pay a solid 50% of it off and hope for the best with crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:29:09
only at half chub now, i need some price action
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:14:20
My crystal ball says we'll go through 10K in the next 24 hours then back down to ~8.5K. I'm kinda ready for a correction tbh, this constant action has me anxious about a big pull back

yeah that was sarcasm lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:59:06
I still kick myself for buying pot off the darkweb back around 2011-2012. I was buying Qs every two weeks for like 30 btc. Must have spent at least 500 btc.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:43:18
See I've heard that but it went like 60 points higher over the past year by keeping a small balance on my three cards (~100 dollars each a month, always paid on time). 
That being said I racked one up to 8000 to pay for school once and that caused my score to drop like 40 points when it took three months to pay it off. As soon is it was paid off though the score went back up to where it was.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:14:34
Back in 2017 I was 100 percent ethereum. After the crash I converted half of it to btc and sold half for cash, still making a nice 1000 percent profit.
I'm so glad I did. I was able to fund my education with the cash and now I have the equivalent of the exact same amount of eth dollar wise. There are definately other good projects out there but nothing like btc.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:12:35
Never forgetti
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:59:03
Yeah man I got you for sure, that's the side I've been leaning towards lately, but when I'm increasing my net worth by a large margin by doing nothing, much larger than the interest charge on the credit card, it's kinda hard to justify selling in my head.
Maybe I'll go somewhere in the middle and sell a bit and decrease my balance to 1k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:58:13
Use limit order next time. Market order means you sell at the price when your order is processed.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:52:26
Is there any actual proof of institutions buying? I haven't been active in the crypto space much since the 2018 crash.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:56:17
If its only 25 bucks I wouldn't worry too much about timing.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:50:55
I'd sell everything except the ether for bitcoin. Maybe even the ether too. BTC is where its at now and where it will be at in the future, but IMO ether is basically the only other crypto with  potential.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:45:13
No, I'm thinking it'll be back before too long. 2019 will probably be the last year we see it though.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:32:20
oof ouch owie my money
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:55:36
Yeah that's my thing, my credit cards are the only debt I carry (used crypto to pay for my education) and my credit score is pretty good for being 24 (~740). I hate getting charged 80 bucks a month just for carrying a balance though so idk
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:04:05
I'm seeing 11300 on coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:06:40
yeah you gotta be careful to not get blinded by the hopium/doom cycle
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:57:09
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:48:45
Question, if you all had around 3k of credit card debt would you sell some of your btc to pay it all off? Or just pay the minimum and take the interest? I'm leaning towards paying it off as I have enough to cover it from crypto and other investments, but idk. I hate debt but I'd also hate selling early in a bull run if that's where we're at.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:01:12
I didn't think about that, I opened up the credit card (Chase/United Airlines) for the sign up bonus since I was getting like a quarter of a percent cash back on my previous card. Maybe I'll take a nice trip and use the bonus then try to get into a card with a lower rate.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:58:25
Because people are selling
