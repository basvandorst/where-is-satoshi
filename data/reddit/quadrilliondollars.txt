Coinbase's vault is very safe, and in general, they store &gt;98% of bitcoins offline. Don't believe all the FUD in here. It is a thousand times more probable to lose your bitcoins if you store them yourself, unless you are an expert and go great lengths and put a  lot of work to secure your bitcoins, and even then, many things can happen to make them inaccessible forever (like by simply losing/forgetting/getting stolen your private key).

He did great on that interview, he just failed to make clear that can not be Blockchain without Bitcoin, and he kept referring to permissioned bankchains as 'blockchains'. There are no "blockchains" but only one and that is inseparable from Bitcoin. 
So there is still confusion out there in that regard sometimes. We just need to keep making clear the differences between a Private Permissioned Bankchain and ***the*** Bitcoin Blockchain.

Coinbase is very safe, and its Vault is even safer with &gt;99% btc cold stored offline. For all those saying: "If you don't hold it, you don't own it" I tell them that there it's much more probable to lose your bitcoins if you store them yourself... unless you are an expert, very organized and safely keep multiple back-ups. And even then, you are at risk of theft if somebody find any of your back-ups or brute forces them. Having your coins in Coinbase Vault is OK.

We have mined 15.7 million = 75% of total. So 3/4's of all bitcoins that will ever exist are already mined. From those, there is a 'popular average' that estimates the lost/inactive forever coins at around 3 million. I consider that amount to be believable. And that is not 'priced-in' yet, but eventually will, increasing the value of the remaining "live" coins. Anyway we slice it, the value of bitcoins will be increasing over time, it is not a matter of 'if' but more about 'by how much'. Check these interesting stats:

@_date: 2016-06-22 15:59:12
The probability for bitcoin to increase in price is much higher than the possibility to decrease, this tidal wave can't be stopped by anybody or any government, they just can slow it down at best. Coinbase is a great option to buy and hold your coins, even tough a lot of people here are against leaving your coins there, the truth is, there is much more likely for you to lose your coins than them losing them, they store &gt;99% of btc off-line in cold storage, can't be stolen or lost. I recommend using their Vault free service.

Only fools would be selling gold or bitcoin now, this is a perfect time to buy them (also silver). Gold will skyrocket when the honeymoon with Trump is over, so just a matter of time, and will be a very short time, at that. At the latest, the stock market will crash in January, just after Trump inauguration, since all pretenses for a robust economy will be pointless then. 
Also if the Fed raises rates again, even just o.25% like last December, will have the same effect but multiplied as it had just entering 2016: Gold will go up really high and the stock market will crash again entering 2017. Mark this post.

Wow, what a shitstorm for DB. On Friday their stock bounced up from all-time lows on a simple unconfirmed rumor that the DOJ would decrease the fine from 14 billion to less than 6 billion. Since Monday is holiday in Europe, expect a large drop in all banking stocks on Thursday (and on Monday in the US). Shit is ever closer to hit the fan. And today we have the Chinese currency enter the IMF currency basket , that will have a large effect also:

Oh, they are. They just got a breather because Obama told the DoJ to cut the fine to just 4 billion so they could afford it, they don't want to rock the waters by any means before the election of Hillary. Once the elections are over, whoever wins, all bets are off, and even the Fed can stop pretending (will stop because can't sustain it anymore anyway) and will launch QE4 and maybe even negative interest rates and 'bail-ins'. In Europe already they have NIRP and the plan in place to go ahead with the 'bail-ins', starting precisely with Deutsche Bank.

Their money's value is vanishing (government devaluing/weakening it so they can export more -'see currency wars') and they want to put in anywhere else (real state, other currencies, bitcoin etc), but with the government controls it's easier to take it out of the country using bitcoin. Most of them sell the bitcoin once outside for other currencies, but some hold. So if the trend continues and just a fraction of them hold (do't sell btc back), bitcoin will continue to rise in price.
