This is the reason why I dreaded the growth of BTC and alts being too fast. I wanted slow growth where it gave people the opportunity to actually learn about the coins they're investing in. Nowadays people get in the market because of FOMO and nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:35:59
Honestly, all crypto exchanges are garbage. They make so much on fees but their customer service do not exist. I really hope coinbase and other exchanges get taken out by some other companies that actually have customer service in mind...

It was long overdue for a major correction. You rookies need to go through about 10 of these to really understand how the whales manipulate the market. Did you really think it was just gonna go up forever? It went from $2000 to $20,000 in 3 months, growth like that isn't good... Now I have my 12yo nephew and my girl's high school dropout cousin talking about bitcoin SMH.

My girl loves sales except when it comes to crypto. I tell her it's good time to buy, she tells me Hell No!  She's only interested in buying when the price is high. FOMO is strong on this one.

Yeah let me rephrase that, the Rothschild created the "modern" finance and banking system, especially the privately owned central banks.

So basically the younger generation sees college as a scam and the older generation sees college as a golden ticket to financial freedom. Imo, college was worth it until the early 2000s. This day and age, you come out with so much debt, you're probably better off just working for that 4 to 5 years and gathering skills. Being debt free is the most important thing in becoming financially independent, not how much you make... They certainly don't teach important things pertaining to life in college that's for sure. One thing though, life is a game and you have to play it right, is college right for you? Ultimately, it's for you to decide.

I would say mind your own business and stop acting like you care. Most people only care about themselves. More people die from peanut allergies than measles in the US. Do you go preaching to people not to eat peanuts? Give me a break with your fake sanctimonious empathy.

Science isn't what you think it is... Like everything in this world, it's driven by money. Whoever controls the media controls the mind. 
For example, if someone gets cancer what is everyone's next step? Get chemo right? Why is that? Because that's what the media and the doctors tell you to do. So how much does it cost and what is the remission rate? Who the fuck cares, the science says it's the right thing to do. 
Also if vaccine actually worked, why do people that have been vaccinated worry about others that have not? Since you are vaccinated, you shouldn't worry about whatever disease that's going around correct? You should be immune so do not worry what others do. People that argue about vaccination are basically all saying vaccines do not work. Think for a second. If immunization worked, you really shouldn't worry about others. Before I get labelled an anti-vaxxer, I believe in vaccination but not 100 shots before you turn 18. The modern vaccine protocol is garbage. 
If I told you healthcare system is flawed and it's purposely designed that way, you'd say I'm nuts or say I believe in pseudoscience so I'll just stop here.

If you know anything about Askren, he is a marketing genius. Yeah the last fight didn't go according to his plan but if he were to win that fight, he would've gotten the title shot. From virtually a no name to a title shot in two fights. That's from mindfucking with other fighters. 
Most UFC fighters are dumb as a rock but Askren is actually smart. It's good that he promotes crypto.

I was big advocate of precious metals until I realized, you'll never get the market price. Only place you can get a decent price is Ebay and even then you'll get way below market price after all the fees. It's good to have a little but it's not worth it to have most of your investments in it. Trust me I was part of the silver and gold community on Youtube for many years. Most of those guys are good people but 99% are ultra misers. That's good and bad...

What's your 7 year return from gold and silver? And how would you exchange your precious metals for fiat? Been there done that. Gold and silver prices are suppressed and you will never get fair prices from them since everyone wants to low ball you. Try selling them if you have any. Then you'll realize they're not worth all the hassle.
