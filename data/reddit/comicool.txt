I don’t know any locals in town x though so I’m gunna need some service to connect me with those recommendations. Sure I could use google to search, but I can do that now, and it’s super annoying and time consuming. It’ll still end up being some big Silicon Valley service that can find me the best restaurants with a touch of a button and the most well known service will prevail. 
Unless you are saying there is going to be an open protocol service for searching where I have to pay for the bandwidth for each search?

Think about how user friendly and easy Uber is to use. Think about how the real time map works and how it links you up with a driver. Think about the UI the driver has. Think about all the features of Facebook and how easy it is to connect and interact. All this stuff takes work and servers to maintain.
Even though there is a protocol, someone still needs to create and maintain a great front end to make it easy and fun to use.
For example the internet is run on TCP-IP which is a protocol for connecting information and nodes. It doesn’t automatically make it easy for you to find a taxi driver or connect with you.
Your suggestion is no different, creating a service that connects people in with a great front end user experience takes effort and people need to get paid for their work.

I admire your idealism. However in your world if for example I want to search for local restaurants that deliver food, I am probably paying nodes that participate in running the traffic and invest in building and maintaining the protocol and they probably pool together to score more chance of traffic and will become huge. So nothing will really be better.

Unfortunately people will think about it, and they will think about it more when it adds up, because it’s their money, and it will add up as everything is run by these protocols that you have to pay for. It’s not something you can just ignore. This is where user experience comes in, and paying every time you want to access information is bad user experience, so some service is going to show ads or a commission to sellers, but for users it will be free, and easy to use and so it will be popular and we will have gone full circle.

Uber shot to popularity because of its ease of use and the fact that you didn’t have to pay the ridiculous rates that taxis charged. Also many taxis companies are big and act themselves as middle men with call centres and bookings.
Now you are saying when an open protocol is created a taxi company is going to fund development of a front end on it, take back power from Uber and do well? Maybe if their user experience is good they will take market share back. But nothing is stopping that from happening now without a blockchain solution.
Either way people will flock to the solution with the best service whether it’s built on a blockchain solution or not. The solo taxi driver is going to have to pay for marketing and a pre made front end solution to get business or drive around picking up people off the street.
I think you underestimate the value of “middlemen” or people working as a team. And at the end of the day everyone is trying to make a profit, even an onion relay that earns money for transferring encrypted data is a “middleman” and one that does it well and people know about through marketing and exposure and has the capacity to support lots of traffic is going to get the most business.

Don’t worry wait a bit longer and hopefully it’ll crash to today’s price, then you can be happy and buy on the dip

During the next correction he price might drop as low as the price today! It’ll be worth waiting for later so you can buy it cheap at today’s price.

You should check out Dogecoin. That’s the attitude they have there

If your lucky it’ll DIP as low as today’s price

Firstly relax regarding China taking over control of the global economy, it wont be any worse than it is now, bitcoin or not its going to happen. Also have trust that during any times of darkness, our Japanese saviour Satoshi Nakamoto will rise from the shadows and lead the fight against the imperialistic power that is bitcoins.
