the amount of sheer ignorance this community has in believing that you will be rewarded for simply holding through turbulent times. not adjusting for real world factors and simple truths and facts is just beyond idiotic

I for sure agree he was involved with insider trading but the quote applies nevertheless. stupid money in, smart money out

the only reasonable answer to this question is the amount you would save in paying short term capital gains rather than holding for longer than a year. personally I think you're an idiot if you didn't day trade last week because while the HODL'ers made their 5% when it went from $12&gt;$19K&gt;$15K I damn near doubled my money continually buying the dips and then selling them off hours later only to repeat.

you literally just described what speculation is. point being the futures have had no effect yet because they haven't even started. take the rumor going around today about South Korea banning exchanges now. while the FUD may have affected the actions of some, in reality the South Korean ban has no effect because it doesn't exist. any news about anything can cause what you're describing. but I guess we'll just have to wait and see

dude my mom asked me about Bitcoin today. yes this is uncharted territory. it's gone full mainstream and the price increase this week is pure speculation. if you don't see that then I don't know what else to tell ya

honestly I think it will have the complete opposite effect. stabilization of price and heavily reduced volatility. introducing Bitcoin into the futures market gives it a lot of credibility and hopefully prevents the market from the vulnerability of the various types of crashes in the past (China ban, Bcash pump and dump, Mt. Gox, etc). but then again, who the fuck knows. either way...HODL

you're best bet is to invent a time machine, go back and read how to securely store your bitcoins on a hardware wallet or at least set up 2 factor authentication through your Coinbase account. also, tell your past self not to put money into Bitcoin when you don't have a job and can't afford to lose it. good luck

because if you need a credit card to purchase Bitcoin then you shouldn't be investing in Bitcoin in the first place.

how can you say it's affected the price when it hasn't even begun trading yet. it's the speculation of the get quick rich idiots that has caused the increased volatility in the past week. the actual effect of futures has not set in yet bro
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:47:32
personally I don't think it will affect the price of Bitcoin whatsoever but will bring credibility to the market in general. if anything I think volatility will decrease. but then again who knows.

Jesus Christ, didn't think people needed this info first but here you go....
1. if you absolutely need money in your account within hours you can wire large deposits for ~$25. this is worth it if you are depositing thousands at a time
2. attach your debit card to Coinbase...same fee as credit card but you should never borrow money to buy crypto
3. deposit money through your checking account and wait the few days until it gets there to make trades. if you need to make a trade bc the market is sky rocketing right now chances are you already missed the surge
4. for fuck sake, use the actual back-end of Coinbase (GDAX) to make your trades to avoid these fees in the first place
5. if you're looking for smaller amounts to trade with use Gemini to deposit $500 a day from your checking account and have access to that money instantly 
6. DON'T USE A CREDIT CARD TO BUY CRYPTO. why do you think you're not allowed to buy lottery tickets with a credit card, it's crazy this isn't regulated yet.

you're all retards.

love the idea of a news feed. public platform to criticize your friends with weak hands. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:44:50
if you think about it it's actually a good thing when you lose money
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:23:34
here's a better tip, if you're using a credit card to buy crypto you're an idiot
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:32:57
ill be honest, this cleared up a lot of questions I had
