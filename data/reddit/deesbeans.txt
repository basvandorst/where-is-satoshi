People like you have been trying to understand the market since there was a market. TA is bullshit and if we could predict the future we all would be rich. Shill your nonsense to the BCASH or xrp forum.

When I invest it's what I am willing to part with. I traded my fist in for a better currency I'm long term on this. I'll probably sell a few when it hits around 500k just for some invests in real estate I want to develope.
@_date: 2019-07-17 17:43:26
Hey boys I'm a big time Bitcoin holder for a few years now I've been investing. I also do alot of real estate that's what has allowed me to invest in Bitcoin. Real estate is good but it is hard to find awesome deals. And it's slow but it does pay good returns for a monthly cash flow.

I would assume when the did the skecty BCASH thing. It is one of the reasons Bitcoin crashed after.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:49:49
Short term wise you are 100% correct. Bitcoin needs slow adoption not overnight.

What's it's value then ? What's it worth to you?
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:22:35
How is that you have nothing to show for your fist money it's backed by nothing. It has inflated so much. How long until we become venazula or Zimbabwe? Every fiat currency will eventually fail.

Yes you can buy commodities with Bitcoin. Log into APMEX you can literally buy gold silver palladium and platinum with Bitcoin. You can buy anything you want with Bitcoin. You clearly have done zero research and have no understanding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:56:21
So what's the lie then ? Is a halving not deflation ? I don't understand your argument. 50 to 25 to 12.5 to 6.25 what do you call that ?
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:16:15
Well duh
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:38:02
I love Trump but I disagree on this one. But from his perspective he's biased he is the government of course he wants the US dollar to be the best it is the best for out country. Bitcoin is better.
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:55:52
I've done extensive research hence why I am here and hence why I invest 25% of my income in Bitcoin. If you hate bitcoin so much why are you here ?

It's not based on any of that it's based simply on stock to flow. Aka supply and demand. Just like gold look it up.
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:08:53
Sounds like your investing way more they you can afford to lose. That would be the only reason you would feel that way.

Probably because he already loaded up on it in ten years no one can afford it with fiat anymore
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:29:57
Another shit coin shill most likely. how's the security of the network. XRP is fast but it also is all pre mine and owned by ripple.
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:21:12
So you think what the fed is doing and our national n debt is good ? You also think that fiat currency is a good thing?
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:04:46
In what way will the institutions screw it up in your opinion ?
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:58:57
The dollar is backed by nothing. They just keep making more and more until eventually it will be worthless. Bitcoin has value because it is a global currency not just a single country. There will only be 21 mil. It has scarcity and it can be send anywhere without limitations. And it has never been hacked or counterfeited yet.
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:02:31
FYI I love Bitcoin and have been in a while. It does not take a genius to acknowledge the fact that liberals are corrupt and easily bought. So a small bit of research and you will see. Also just know I'm anti big government and I even work for them not all of us are bad guys.
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:34:31

@_date: 2019-07-12 03:49:09
Not an excuse dipshit. Think about it right now shitty fist is what most people use in the US if Trump came out and said fiat is dead long live Bitcoin while holding a sword in the air we would have literally global collapse of markets. People would be destroyed overnight. He literally can not support Bitcoin in his position right now.

Oh and the hyperinflation because we don't have anything left to stop out dollar or any fist currency from crashing. There are countries now utilizing negative interest rates which is insane.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:26:18
BAKKT is already priced into Bitcoin right now all of this big dicks have been buying for a long time. Remember Jamie dimon when he said if you use Bitcoin he will fire you. Well after that dip guess who was buying Bitcoin ..... That's right JP Morgan.
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:35:32
Sounds like you lost some money day trading......
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:00:38
The only reason why we are not backed by gold is because the people who owned the Banks were greedy and took away the standard so they can lend more and make more interest. It will collapse in our life time. But while you still can.
@_date: 2019-07-31 11:17:37
I am a government worker, prior military, real estate investor and I have a few businesses. I invest 25% of my income into BTC. But to everyone put there only invest what you are able to and willing to lose. I put alot into BTC if it tanks nothing changes I can still pay bills and live. But but..... If it moons I'm set for life. Risk vs reward the ups definitely outweigh the bad. Educate yourselves, Invest smart, and HODL STRONG. Getting rich is slow and steady I promise.

Nothing just defeats the purpose of the safety deposit box. You can look at it from two perspectives. 1. It doubles your risk of exposure. Or two. It doubles your chance of recovery.

@_date: 2019-07-26 23:45:07
As time goes less and less are created the price deflates which give it more value. It's a deflationary currency that's what they mean by that.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:02:43
You clearly are ignorant the public hasn't even been in Bitcoin at all a very tiny percentage of people have. The institutions are just now getting it how could you say that it won't go up past 18k it and and will again 18k will be a bottom one day.
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:46:44
I am a firm believer of  tweets and medium articles. Stock to flow model. Based on the S2F model Bitcoin should be worth around 1mill in 2025-2027 timeframe.

I am a big Bitcoiner but I also like Trump and his business mind set. He is supposed to hate anything but the US dollar. He is government fist currency is government power. He couldn't support Bitcoin even if he wanted to.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:24:02
Go away bro you are still here coming at people you clearly hate bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:10:48
Way to go you ruined it.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:13:06
The difference is this. With fiat you trust the ones in power. With Bitcoin you trust yourself with your own money. I'm trusting myself. If you like others controlling your life then enjoy. XRP is a good coin for you.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:18:36
Bro you are fucked haha it's used as payment get over yourself
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:02:52
Haha well to be honest 1 million dollars isn't that much anymore. Depending on age you will need more then that to retire. Even invested well at a 1% return that's only ten Grand a month and that buys you a middle/high class lifestyle.
@_date: 2019-08-05 09:38:40

No you have it all wrong. I'm not converting shit. All BTC will not be sold or spent. Only fiat I spend.
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:22:03
You work and earn more fiat then you inject it into an exchange and you get bitcoins back. More work=More Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-08-07 09:29:58
300k house 2400sqft 50 years old cost 2050$ a month. 250$ electric, if not working health insurance cost 2000$ a month, car insurance 160$, wife mini van 465$ my shitty truck 225$, water/sewer 120$ gas, 40, internet/cable $150, vehicle gas, 120$, grocery's for the house 1500$, and 500 misc. So I would have room of 2k-2.5k a month. Too tight with a young family one medical issue or something serious I'm in trouble.

You guys will be fine in about 50 years to Islam so brexit is a good start to fight that. We will see good luck bud. If you need anything let me know for real.

If you only knew me you would learn to love me. The issue is this liberals will not listen to anything it's their way or nothing so why waist time? Most liberals are robots and can't think for themselves. I've done very well for my self because I'm not afraid to step outside the box. The moral of the story is if you are a liberal then you are a pussy boy sheep with no single idea of your own.

@_date: 2019-08-03 02:05:43
I don't have the time or energy to explain that liberals are actually the fascist side. If you read up on your history you will find out that the socialist Nazis were fascist. So saying a conservative is fascist just shows how ignorant you truly are. Do some research before you post some dumb shit.

Bees travel by light. If a bee is trapped In a glass bottle even with an opening on the bottom but the sunlight is at the top the bee with remain stuck trying to exit toward the light. If you flip the bottle over the bee will be free from it's open prison. Much like us in our current monetary system. We are the bee the current rule of law is the bottle. Satoshi flipped the bottle giving us the chance to be free if we so choose.

According to PlanB  stock to flow model has a 95% accuracy when it comes to predicting the price of Bitcoin. The price prediction is based upon how much stock there is and based on how much flow which would be the amount of mining each year. after each having the monetary reward gets cut in half so the stock to flow ratio drastically changes. Utilizing the stock to flow methodology you can predict an upwards of over 100k at the peak and then it should settle back down at a true value of 55k until the next halving in 2024.

Sounds like a catch 22. Leave it in and slowly lose it or in India lose all of it because the bank went under. Or pull it out put it under your mattress. Or... Or.... Buy Bitcoin ?? Answer seems clear to me.

You are better off buying Bitcoin itself 2k won't be enough to make a good profit with mining.

Not trolling bro the price would go up in fist of course but it wouldn't matter to them the cost because they can keep making more money. What do you have .003 of Bitcoin. Go to the bcash thread if you can't have a good discussion.

What's makes you think your mansion wouldn't cost more at that point?

Worst case or best 100-300k about a year after may 2020 based on stock to flow ratio.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:02:40
What's odd to me is that it goes up like 500-700$ then 30 minutes later settles right back down. And it's happened quite a few times recently. I haven't seen it quite like this before.

Money is power and they currently hopefully not much longer have that power. What do you think their plan is to stop Bitcoin from taking over.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:34:04
You'd have to literally submerge the book or straight blast it for over a minutes. You can put out a house fire with not much water believe it or not. I've seen training scenarios where a guy uses a 2.5 gallon water can sprays the ceiling then closes the door and the fire for the whole room goes out.
