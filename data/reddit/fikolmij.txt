First and foremost we need to optimize the data we submit to the blockchain, advances like Segwit do this.
Secondly, when 2 billion people are using it then a bigger block would be feasible, but our priority has to be optimization before bloating the blockchain.

System Preferences -&gt; Network -&gt; Configure IPv4 Manually.
You are likely on a 192.168.1.X range (if not change 192.168.1 to necessary range) network, so settings like:
IP Address : 192.168.1.100
Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0
Router : IP address of your Router
DNS Server : IP address of your router

BTC is not about a price, it is about a technology. A world changing technology that if you believe in you should hold.
If you are a non-believer then sell. 
Personally I am holding as I believe in the tech, I am a part of the first real self deflating currency the world has ever seen. Which means in 10 years 1 BTC could very well be worth 1 million dollars, but at the same time 1 million dollars might only buy you a loaf of bread.

Easiest way might be to specify a static IP on your computer. DHCP and port forwarding can be a bit finicky.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:38:35
What IP address is your router?
It would suggest that you are not on a 192.168.1.X range, some ISPs do use different IP ranges.

Don't complain cos you don't know howto use it. Just sent a transaction for only $12 in fees and it got into the next block, if you are willing to wait an hour or 2 you could get it in for alot less than that.

Just had a quick google, it would appear Arris Time Warner use the 192.168.0.X range.
IP : 192.168.0.100
Subnet : 255.255.255.0
Router : 192.168.0.1
DNS : 192.168.0.1
Then set port forwarding up to the ip address of 192.168.0.100

Depends on how you go about the attack and the tools you do or don't use as to whether it will record the correct password. But once open does it really matter? You can export the private key and move it to another wallet/computer of your choosing.
I wouldn't bother attacking the login screen as you will probably need to do this with exterior hardware, but as mentioned above if you used the boot cd option remember to take a full copy (clone) of the drive in case it has been encrypted. Using the boot cd if successful will take a matter of minutes.

Getting so wound up over the name BCash is pathetic, the masses choose the name for things, not the company/owner. Never seen Ronald McDonald give me the finger for calling it Maccy D's or James Dyson flipping me the bird for calling it a Hoover.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:23:34
Just export the private key on the old machine, import the private key into Electrum. Same for the old key you have found.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:12:41
I think you are probably on the right track, being in IT personally I would use the Mac to store my wallet, with nothing else on the system to cause a possible hack. As such I would look at performing a dictionary attack on the wallet.dat building your own dictionary from the passwords that are known.
Getting into the Windows machine is probably going to be trivial at most, just google "ultimate boot cd windows 10 password reset" obviously changing the version of Windows as required.
Hope that helps some what, good luck.

The deception is disgusting, camping on btc subreddit and bitcoin.com is about as malignant as you can get. But should we expect more from a convicted felon?
Until such a time as they release both the subreddit and the domain I cannot trust them and will make sure every single person I know is informed as much. The ones I feel sorry for are the people who don't have a friend to give them this information.
This sub really should have a sticky explaining this to anyone new to crypto currency. Surely we could help resolve this, but the mods just sit back, let it happen and remove most attempts by the community to help the newer buyers.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:15:07
No idea who you are talking to here, I've been out ALL day at the footie.... My posts were trying to help OP, nothing more. If you've got a bee in your bonnet about something make a thread for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:34:10
The main reason I am against BCH is because they are camped on a domain and subreddit inherently linked to Bitcoin and brand leeching and deceiving people new to crypto. BTC which we all know is the ticker and preferred abbreviated form of naming Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash. If they are so serious about being a proper crypto standing on their own feet, then move out of the btc sub and bitcoin.com domain. Until then you are a scam.
Personally I believe the world needs more than one crypto and Bitcoin Cash is as good as most and could fill a spot, but until they step back from trying to impersonate BTC I can't support it in the knowledge it is deceiving good honest people.

The exchanges used to call it Bcash, until Roger and his cronies little tirade. Everyone I know calls it BCash in conversation, because it is easier to say, very much like a nickname. The people who SMS and email me call it BCash because it is easier to type. Get off your high horse and accept it, it's only Rogers cronies who persist with the full name and get their knickers in a twist over anyone who doesn't.

Nothing to see here, even at $5000 per bitcoin (the supposed median), it will only have risen 500% in the preceding 12-18 months. Pretty sure my scumbag bank won't be offering me 500% APR on my savings.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:04:55
Way down????
How do people still think like this?
Only 85% up on this time last year, and only about $2000 up on the cost of making a single bitcoin. Yup the price is way down... /s

This is just another straw on an already broken backed camel. Roger Ver had no business accepting a segment to talk about Bitcoin, the guy is deluding himself. 
There is plenty of space in this world for more than one crypto currency, but his methodology is hurting all of them. Getting Ver to do a news segment on Bitcoin is akin to making Colonel Sanders do a segment on how amazing a Big Mac is.
Grow up Mr Ver.

Of course it can, but remember 99.99% of all money laundering is currently done through centralized banks with their full support in fiat currencies.

Easiest way is probably to extract the private key and import into Electrum. Job done.

Someone has seen the light.
As with any currency they should be measured against single units of their counterparts. Number of Bits/Satoshis to the Dollar/Pound/Euro/Yen etc.
This would have made Bitcoin a much less scary prospect for those new to it all and those still to come.

It has been dropping consistently since Thursday when it reached it's peak of around 230k. It should also be pointed out that Coinbase do not fill the mempool, their trading is done on their platform not on the blockchain.

People will be betting on whether Bitcoin goes up or down. For every bet that it will go up they will also take a bet that it will go down so they (CME/CBoE) won't be risking any money of their own.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:56:20
It's getting pathetic, they are akin to a confidence trickster. This sub could do with a sticky warning people that and bitcoin.com are NOT Bitcoin and that they are conning people by claiming as much.
There are even posts laughing at people who have mistakenly bought BCH instead of BTC, this is not on. If they believe so much in their system why do they have to parade as something they are not? 
This deception has to stop, it hurts all crypto currencies and should be shut down by the community as quickly as possible with whatever means we have available. Personally I think the world has plenty of space for more than one crypto currency and BCH is as good as any, but gaining market share through deception is low and call me naive but I expect better of people like Roger "I'm a millionaire" Ver.

Nothing a VPN wouldn't sort out... They can't shut down the dark web or torrents, they have almost no chance to shut down any part of crypto.

The point that 1 Bitcoin is worth 100m of any FIAT currency, then that FIAT currency is already dead. So why measure it against that??
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:45:54
If that was the case why is the unconfirmed transactions falling like a brick now then? Several hundred thousand users just left again and closed their coinbase accounts?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:25:28
Just wait, unconfirmed transactions is down from 250k a few days ago to 100k today. It looks more and more like it was under attack and not just load from new users. Another few days and the backlog will be cleared and you could probably sneak the transfers in for pittance if not free.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:38:09

Yup and had you asked someone who had been round the block a few times, you would know that come Feb it was unlikely to be worth half of what it was before xmas.
Anyone looking to turn a quick buck is looking at BTC the wrong way. 
This is a long term project, come the halvening and the institutional money slowly increasing, the wider adoption as apps improve, even at 11k I think in 24 months you will be laughing at the worry you put in here. In 24 years then who the hell knows...

Google for Bitcoin Vanity Address Generator, this can generate the wallets and even make them with a personalised Vanity address.
It might be best to have them generate the address (keeping the private key to themselves) and give you the public address so you can charge it with BTC. You could provide a sandboxed computer that generates and prints the address/key as part of the service.
