@_date: 2016-08-30 09:51:28
wtf what's your problem? Economic actors bring the money, take the risk and make things big. If this is "no effort" than ... don't know ... in what world are you living?
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:44:22
Who said that 4 MB was the absolute safe maximum? I thought 4 MB was the maximum for which EVERY expert agreed that it was absolutely safe, while many experts have been ok with 8 or 12 or 20 MB.
Also all this bip 109 ranting completely ignores that we have run for years at 1-10% of the blocksize limit ... but I don't want to revive and already finished battle. Just want to say that it's not as easy as you like it to be

Hehe, the internet is not good for us --


A bit ... I'm trying to get my head around this ... In my view social influence is a prestate of controll, and I'm not really sure in which state we are ... I'll continue with the next quote


Hm ... why do you refuse it? In my view there are more indications that blockstreams controlls bitcoin than against it. If you have something like 70 Million Dollar and 10 or 12 or 14 core devs on your payroll, it's not that hard to imagine a power grab. I find it harder to think that there is no controll in this scenario.
I don't say that there is a proof of controll or something like this. I just say that I'm shocked to see someone like you refusing to talk about the sheer possibility that there can be a power grab and - maybe most worrisome - attacking those who talk about the possibility. 


Ok, than don't talk like this (nobody should, but everybody does from time to time).


Yes, to some part that is completely right. Nodecount, blocks and so on - it all indicates that the "techhnological majority" is not interesting in forking to 2 mb. 
But my impression is that the majority is for bigger blocks. Just my impression. I made several surveys, I asked some importent people in germany's bitcoin space, the coinspondent did the same. It all over, over and over again, the same result: 70-90 percent are for bigger blogs. Nodes are another issue I'd love to talk about, but I don't want to stretch it too much. 
More important - you can't deny that the achieving of this majority was a result of censorhip, fud, closed door meetings, a troll army, many layers of truth-twisting, ddos-attacks, lies and character assassinations of other devs. Even if I'd support the outcome, I'll never support the method how it was achieved or the persons applying this methods.
That most people here support the methods is a big disappointment, maybe a sign that for most Bitcoin is just about greed and not about freedom.


Sure. If Lightning is out we should start a new coin with 10kb-blocks, a coin that will forever run on every laptop or smartphone (handy?) on the world. 
But reality is currently, we have this big big blockchain and as it is we need a bigger blockchain to change the world. You may hate it, but I can imagine a future where only big companies can run a node, but I still hold my private keys exclusively, can build transactions by myself and can choose the node to push my tx. It is no longer decentralized, but if this is the blockchain that rules the world's financial system, it is a big big step forward from current affairs. 
It's ok if you think bitcoin only in terms of decentralization and not in terms of scale and freedom. You like it more to stay in a tiny niche than to get big and less decentralized. Ok. But don't expect this to get a law. And don't let this blind yourself in regard to the people and methods that fight for your vision.


I don't think so. Someome else on the other sub made a post expressing why everybody needs to at least worry about blockstream, that nailed it. It's like "imagine ww3 was dominated by google". (btw - why does nobody talk about google-employees attending meetup between core (blockstream) and miners?)
Whatever - don't want to stretch this more than it deserves. If you think it is not ok to ask critical questions about the company which has undoubtly the most influence on bitcoin, this is your problem and not mine. I just don't get it. I don't think you are a hound of authority, so why?
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:57:56
Sure, that's maybe true ... the proposed sidechains are somehow like visa or paypal.
Are you aware of the fact that some people, even those, who want bitcoin to scale offchain, are here because they don't want visa or paypal or any other centralized system? 
I mean, hello, do you really believe this is a binary choice between 1mbblocks and centralization? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 10:51:48
Ah, semantics. 




I think it depends on the mechanism how a coin adjusts difficulty. With E** even 0.x % can cause a coinsplit, with btc you need at least some percent of the hashrate ...

nice to see some reasoning here

@_date: 2016-08-30 08:26:22
Are you related to anything? 
I don't think you are so stupid to not understand how "social influence on the protocoll" and OP are related, so I ask - why do you do this? 
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:58:52
explain why it is "nut job anti logic" to ask critical questions about a company obviously having undoubably reached a  major influence in bitcoin development!
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:57:18
Let's stopp this. You accuse people calling out the influence of your company of having "conspiracy nut-job logic", and if asked why, you refuse, because they have no logic.
This is like saying "I say you are stupid, but I don't explain why, because you are stupid."
You obviously don't want to discuss but to attack. Why? Do you love your employer so much that you want to attack anybody saying something bad about it? Or are you hired for marketing? If so, it doesn't work well ...
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:24:39
Let's ask the other way round - what core devs with influence are not hired by blockstream? My impression is that the majority of "important" core devs (e. G. partizipants in IRC-Meetings) are employed by core devs and / or are always ok with the ideas of blockstream hired core devs. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:59:30
ok. Do you have a monkey building sentences for you?
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:10:21
instead of claiming there is no logic you need to provide reasons. Especially because you work for blockstream
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:16:49
Yeah, all hail the chairman who protects us from evil voices of the crowd
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:54:42
ahh ... I just see someone aggressively and undisclosedly about his connection to a certain company bashing anybody who is against blockstream-no-onchain-scaling ... if you don't want to make it public, you can 'pm me.
Who are you? There is a list with people on blockstream's payroll, it's not that huge, and most people of blockstream have an well-known account here. So, if you are no sockpuppet - who are you?

Don't worry. I don't go away. We'll enjoy a lot of romantic hours of social media fighting 
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:41:18
was that the point? I thought it was that you, as the company's founders, gain too much influence by using investor's millions to hire core devs ... 
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:37:21


Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Roger Ver, Andrew Stone, Sergio Lerner, just to name a few who instantly come to mind (maybe I'm wrong, and since it is now seen as a sign of incompetence to believe I have no problem to delete people from that list)
But to some point the new "consens" was that everybody who liked the proposal was no longer a bitcoin expert, so naturally there have been not much bitcoin experts left who liked bip 102 (was this the number?)
Fact is, we did not try it, so we can say things like "most probably it was a bad idea" - but we can't say it is a fact that it was a bad idea because we don't know it. Who does so violates scientific reasoning and engages in personal attacks / propaganda (imho)


It still has nothing to do with GA believing Craig Wright. Nothing. Grexmex's disbelievement in Bitcoin seems to be relevant about his intentions.

@_date: 2016-08-16 18:05:22
Unlimited never programmed to hardfork. It was just programmed to be able to follow a hardfork if capacity needs it. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:59:31
Joe, bitcoin is the game of paranoids. We download 80 gigabyte of blockchain and verify millions of transactions just to be sure to not have scam transactions on our hdd. Why do you get angry if people want to verify social influence on protocoll development - and verify the myth (my opinion) of "nobody has influence"?


That's the subject of the this discussion. If you start with refusing it without reason you should stop contributing to the discussion.


The shit "I speak for the majority" doesn't get better if you do it instead of someone else. We simply don't know what users want. 


Sorry, my brainless mind says that it's worth a try to scale as much as possible onchain. Your logic is like "we can't make everbody a genie, so let's stop building schools"


This attitude ... you know that it is part of the problem and not of the solution?

hehe, I guess germany is the onliest country in the world where you can't buy bread without cash. If I pay with card something &lt; 10€ most of my friends and family members look like I'm an alien.
But, to be honest, this has nothing to do with some resistency against surveillance, but all with technological scepticism ... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:04:37
... right, this is, what I often tell people on *theothersub* and it is definitely a strong symbol of support for core. (while I think on the other side that most nodes are from companies, which don't mind about politics but would instantly switch if there was a fork)
You know what I mean. The supposed hardfork was heavily - and successfully - fighted by core devs and *somemoderators*, cutting the communities in two, burning houses, woods and cities and so on, tricking miners in signing a document to not run other software and so on ... 
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:10:36
are you paid by blockstream to damage the company's public reputation? If not, they clearly made a mistake to hire you
@_date: 2016-08-16 10:54:38
Thanks for the fix
@_date: 2016-08-16 08:34:00
So ... instead of just raising the blocksize-limit, you propose that we
- create a sidechain, which is a technologie that doesn't exist today
- trust a committee of federated entities
- create a new cryptocurrencies for fees on the sidechain (someone has to earn, and you don't earn bitcoins on a sidechain)
- wrestle with a strange wallet that shows double balances?
Not that I don't like the idea of sidechains (if it ever becomes real). But they are really a bad idea to scale and, more than it, to scale quickly.
Better ideas are
- persuade developers to hardfork
- hardfork without developers / miners
- simply use another coin
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:44:23


We never tried it out. Why do you think everybody agrees it was shit?


What does this have to do with it? 
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:06:25

So, I guess this conversation has come to an end, since you don't provide anything except a damage to blockstream''s reputation. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:02:58

Hm, that's the takeaway? They truly care about bitcoin because they are the founders? Wait, i have to search my logic ... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:01:27
Yeah, I got this with the fees, you are the third to remind me. But thank you!
This doesn't clear up things with merged mining or the algorithm to avoid mining at all but still be on a blockchain ... but ... don't mind.
Dash is in existence, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Eth***, Bambicoin, Extracoin, Zeusscoin, Mycoin etc. But I have never seen a wallet supporting sidechains. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see it by now. How can I use it? Is there anybody who uses it? Does BitPay accept sidechain-bitcoins? Is there an exchange supporting sidechain-bitcoins? Or do I have to change them against blockchain-bitcoin, like I have to do when I leave ChangeTip or COinbase, but just more complicated?
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:02:23
please, tell me, what is the "conspiracy nut-job logic"? Asking questions about a company which has a major influence on bitcoin? Why are you so pissed of this?
Please, tell me. I want to hear what you thinks this logic is.
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:25:33


you know that whenever politicians want to play down civil dissatisfaction with what they do they talk about "bad communication"?
The fact is: it's not just that devs did treat users and economic actors disrespectfull. It's that they don't listen to them, they they disrespect their oppinion.
And it's a fact that the economic actors, not the devs, are the one who took the risk of prison to make bitcoin big.  
@_date: 2016-04-18 13:05:57
Na. Sometimes it seems they cannot loose :)
It's just about the notes. In 12.0 they had long and understandable notes, while I think the changes are not as significant as in 12.1 -- that's what I meant. 
Unfortunately we built a atmosphere in which not completely agreeing with core is a sin, like communism or so. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:36:18
They started to work fulltime with bitcoin when it was small.
They sold Bitcoin when it was not clear if this is legal.
They risk to end in jail like Charlie Shrem.
They risk to end in debts after being robbed by some hacker / punished by regulation.
They make the blockchain visible (blockchain.info), give people the chance to easily by / sell bitcoins (coinbase.com, xapo.com, circle.com).
But they didn't contribute anything? Please widen your horizon. Without companies like them bitcoin would be nothing. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 10:45:52
Maybe. But I don't care. Choosing a side because winning is something for cowards, opportunists, loosers. 
@_date: 2016-04-15 14:56:30
This is the most complicated Upgrade of Core I've ever seen and the release notes are very thin. I try to understand, what it does, and it seems it releases a cascade of softforks.

@_date: 2016-08-16 10:53:12
ok, thanks ... I confused it with the merged-mining-problem
@_date: 2016-04-18 13:04:22
Thank you. I thought the first softfork enables the other three softforks to be launched in parallel?
@_date: 2016-08-16 08:31:02


Ah. In what currencies will the fees be? Sidecoins?
@_date: 2016-04-15 15:21:51
Yeah, this is extremely dissatisfying for transparency. 0.12.1 enforces several softforks and paves the way to lightning, but it's heavily confusing for most poeple.

It doesn't matter if it are 10 Gigabyte or 100 Gigabyte.
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:02:28
This is your answer? Fud, since 
- company was cofounded by some core devs &amp;
- project is open source?
So there is NO chance for anybody to get social influence on the protocoll? Bitcoin is resiliant by itself?
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:37:58
Yes, I'm also mostly neutral with a slight preference for carefully raising the limit. But what we've seen and heard of core and its friends in media during last months made it a moral duty to defend the other side.
I still don't assume bad intentions, just dogmatism, group-thinking, ignorance and a lack of empathy for the public. That doesn't need to have any blockstream-conspiracy to disqualify  core as it is today to take the leadership's role that is currently required to reunite the community. Core is good in leading to enhance bitcoin technically, but bad in leading when important decisions are to be find, made and communicated.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:40:18
In this thread people say libsecp256k1 is not proofed to be secure and a speed up to 700% needs a complete rewriting of the algorithm. This sounds very very dangerous. Can someone explain? I think this is a critical point.
Edit: the thread: 
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:30:35
Thanks. I accept your reasons and welcome your willingness to a real discussion. I'm sure, if we start discussing it, it will find no end. 
On some degree everything you say is true and I recommend everybody to think about that before claiming larger blocks. But everything you mention has its other sides:
- coffee: your right that you don't need to store a coffe-cup transaction on 10,000s of nodes. In the long run this kind of usage will disappear or move to altcoins / lightning, but you don't have to force this now. Everything changes.
- 100M trust fund: today it's a bad idea to move 100M with bitcoins. Volatillity, spread on exchanges and exchanges fees make this very very expensive. 
- move 100M when your country collapses: That's one of the best usecases bitcoin could serve. But why should it be the onliest?
- miners / fees 1: fees are not needed now. Currently the best support for miners is to make bitcoin more valuable. Many people think that the higher the transaction capacity, the higher the value and so the higher the block reward. The correlation of number of transactions and value suppports this.
- miners / fees 2: miner manage the risk of orphans against transactions. There is a natural fee market. Also they are free to not accept tx with no fees. The more transactions, the more fees.
- precedent: If the blocksize is raised in consens, it would be a precedent that the system is able to change itself if needed. Increase of the supply is a red herring. It's no option to let the system stay the same forever. That's a design to loose.
- store of wealth: Neither you nor me should want to decide what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is what people make with it. And it's a store of value cause people expect it is used as a payment system and it's actual use as a payment system support the demand for bitcoins. So if you want bitcoin to fail as a payment system you risk that it fails as a store of value.
- centralization: yes, decentralization is extremely important for bitcoin and it has to be carefully thought, which blocksize is able to support this. I think it's higher than 1 MB.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:04:58
All right ... no sense in debating with you. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:32:05
If it works, I'm totally fine with it.
Problem is: SG is very hard to understand, it's not clear how much capacity it adds, it's not written, it's not testet, it's not sure, if it doesn't cause damage to the system, it needs 3-6 month to get activated.
Simply put: SG is the less understood and more complicated solution which has he same effect as say bip202, but is not as sustainable as that - while bip202 could have been deployed in a week instead of half a year.
I fear that this roadmap adds pressure to the core devs to faciliate SG, which could be a very complicated issue that has to be done with time, while bip202 would have been a clear solution that give them at least 12 month to develop SG, thin blocks, IBLT and so on.
If core devs had accepted say bip202 it would have been a party, a strong signal to the markets, a sign of unity, a symbol of fast reaction and of developers listening to the community. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:40:40
I don't decide what Bitcoin was made for. I can define it for me, but I don't want to force my vision to others. 
No matter what you want bitcoin to be - I'm fine with it as long as you don't force it to other. 
As you said: future will show which vision wins. But we are in the present and shouldn't restrict visions now.  Neither me nor you, only time will tell. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:44:26
thanks. I still don't get it. RBF is in, it's opt-in, standard transactions are opt-out, and as a user I can choose to opt-in?
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:13:45
if so there would't be a correlation between empty/full blocks and the intervall beween blocks. But it seems like there is one. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:17:49
And note this:
"Without exaggeration, I have never seen this much disconnect between user wishes and dev outcomes in 20+ years of open source."
I like the calm and analytic approach of JG
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:29:38
I heard this so often. Can you explain, why? I heard several reasons, but none of them convinced me, especially for an increase to 2-4 MB.
- centralizing of nodes through too much upload: With avaerge upload capacity most people in Europe, US and Pacific-Asia can handle blocks up to 8 MB. In average people in south-america and africa can handle blocks up to 2 MB.
- Build a transaction with 2 MB, that needs 10 minutes to verify: libsec will decrease validation time to 2-5 minutes, and I'm sure it's possible to let nodes not accept transactions &gt;1MB (or something like this).
- orphans: the bigger the block, the higher the risk of an orphan. IBLT und Thin / Ẃeak blocks will reduce this risk. Besides, Miners can choose how big a block is. This would make increasing blocks worthless but will not destroy bitcoin.
- hardforks are dangerous: If a hardfork is only triggered by a majority of hashpower and has consens with exchanges / payment providers, the "smaller" chain will disappear. It could cause chaos, maybe a crash, but it will not destroy bitcoin.
You're welcome to add arguments or correct me where I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:19:08
Let them do it. What's the problem? If anybody wants to safe an information on THE blockchain, he can do it when he pays for it. As Greg Maxwell said: Bitcoin is digital cash, not a free ledger for everybody. 
With colored coins bank could safe every asset on earth on the blockchain with just 10 bitcoin. No matter how high "blockchain" usage gets - it will never add any value to bitcoin but just sucks it out.
Why, why are you so eager to let banks use THE blockchain for free? This is everything Bitcoin was not made for.
Disclaimer: I prefere bigger blocks, but that's the worst argument for them.
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:23:33
This is not the best place to argue about all the details ... As often I wonder how people preferring very different methods can agree on the goals. That's tragic part of most conflicts.
I agree with most of your points:
- extending bitcoins usage as a payment-system for coffee should not set the system at risk.
- moving 100M is easy, when you have bitcoins and hold them. It's not, when you don't (like currently 99.9 % of all people having / managing such funds)
- I'm completely ok when bitcoins becomes digital gold and altcoins are used to buy coffee (that's no my vision, but my vision is not important)
Can you go into details why bigger blogs hurt mining-decentralization? Because the orphans? 
Some points I don't agree:
- In my view bitcoins usability as a payment systems is an important reason for bitcoins current usage as a store of value. If blocks reach their limit, bitcoins usability as a payment system will implode and with it its value. While to some later time bitcoin will be a store of value by itself (without payment usage), it's everything but clear that it will ever reach this state when we cut out the payment system now. 
- the blocksize-debate has nothing to do with the 21M cap. Nobody will accept that, and if a miner's cartell chooses to enforce it, it has nothing to do with some decisions made today about the blocksize. 
- bitcoin's ruleset is not that blocks are capped at 1MB. That was a instrument to defend DoS-attacks originally implemented as temporary.
- I don't think 2 MB blocks now would hurt decentralization of nodes too much. If you look at the average upload-capacity of the world's regions and do some math you should assume, that there are enough people capable of running a node. With miner's centralization I ask you for more details. 
in short: increasing the blocksize is a limited method to scale bitcoin without risking the system at all. But nowaday the usage as a payment system is necessary for it's usage as a store of value and not scaling bitcoin will be a risk for both. So I think it's a bad decision to refuse to increase the blocksize on a moderate niveau to pay time to develop better methods to scale.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:42:34
please. 
Bigger blocks doesn't mean BIP101. (I for myself prefer bigger blocks but not bip101).
And wanting BIP101 doesn't mean you want an uncoordinated hardfork.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:54:04
I'm not "my people" or something like this.
If that's your apporach to a discussion, to prejudice and schematise  - please stop it. No matter on which side you are - it doesn't help a bit and increases the mess we're already in.
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:07:16
So now ... a blocksize-increase wouldn't change anything at all? We are running on the limit, but the limit is not because the block-limit, but because low fees and orphans?
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:37:54
so we'll have opt-in rbf, but the feature to make rbf optional "probably won't make it in 0.12"? Please, tell me I got it completely wrong.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:31:00
Yes, that was what I meant. I'm currently observing the ratio of the size of the blocks versus unconfirmed transactions. Usually it's ok, the more time between the block, the more transactions go in a block and no pool prefers to mine empty blocks.
So I'm puzzled about that extreme moment when some nearly-empty blocks in a row arrived while unconfirmed transactions were very high.
Maybe the miners didn't have the transactions at all and this is a problem with propagation through the nodes?
At least it demonstrates that a block-size increase wouldn't help alone to reduce unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:12:54
I thought the same ... But I watched the blocks some time. Some pools mostly reduce their space on 731 kb. But I've seen the same pool collecting more than 900 kb blocks and collecting 200 kb or empty blocks.
Since the full blocks appear more frequently when there is a bigger intervall and the empty blocks more often when there are smaller intervalls, it seems that
a) all the non-confirmed transactions are seen as spam
b) the miners don't see the unconfirmed tx at all
But all in all it demonstrates that bigger blocks won't help to reduce unconfirmed transactions

Sorry ... the community is voting for bigger blocks for more than one year. Not giving them at least 2 MB blocks is a punch in the face.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:36:17
2 MB now and SW in 6 month will help us to keep peace for at least 1, maybe 2 years.
With IBLT, libsec and weak blocks we could pave the way for a further consens for 4 or 6 MB Blocks.
This will buy at least 6-8 years to work on long-term solutions, may it be lightning, sidechains, unlimited, BIP101 or something else.
As I read about the scaling bitcoin conference I hoped for a near term solution like 2MB+SW. Besides the core devs technical brilliance they made the huge psychological mistake to not confess to some minimal raise of the block limit. The signs were too clear that this will result in the crappy situation we are facing now. 
The european union was build on one brillant maxime: A good compromis is when nobody is satisfied. Thats the mindframe we need now.

Who are you to decide what Bitcoin is made for? Bitcoin should be what people want to do with and what bitcoin is capable for. Not more. If you want to decide what people do with a technology you should look for a job at the government.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:36:25
Why this hate and fatalism?
We can't raise the blocksize forever, that's sure. There are scenarios, in which 100 MB blocks are possible on the cost of massive centralization, which is not what I prefer.
But we can raise it now to 2 MB and during the next years to around 8 MB. If you refuse to do so you are like a doctor who says: I can't kill the death, so there is no sense in curing people.

There is an reward for running a node: no other wallet has features like it, e. G. coin control with an graphical interface. Any node like core or xt or unlimited has major privacy features other wallets lack.

I'm amazed how gentle a discussion with opposing perspectives can be on reddit.
We agree that we agree on many points and disagree on some :)
- I understand your fear of building a precedent. Bitcoins big promise is to be change-resistant, so a policy of changing it when the mass wants to change is actually dangerous. So the analogy to the dept-politics are correct. But I think not changing at all is equally bad, so we should find a balance.
btw - what do you think of bitcoin unlimited? It gives users the choice what blocksize they allow. It solves the scaling problem not by some estimated demand but by empirical capability of nodes/miners and would not need further changes. Imho it can be far more conservative than other alternative clients.
- it hard to make some statements about the second point, cause there is no empirical data what bitcoin is used and if there were solid empirical data bitcoin would have failed. So I just can guess, and if it's wright what some people say, darknetmarkets and gambling are main drivers for bitcoin adoption. With constantly more transactions than blocks can get, this transactions will first need more and more time (in principal untill eternity) and more and more fees and second dry out. It's like if gold was not usable for making jewellery, coins and catalysators: the value is pure believe and not supported by operational demand. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:17:15
Ok, seems I got you wrong, sorry. Short answer on your question: The core devs are working on solutions for the problem of mining-centralization (IBLT, weak blocks), but it's not possible to solve this issue finally cause of basic block propagation mechanics and the mining-algorithm. The first can be enhanced, but not solved finally, the second is out of question.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:34:29
you're expecting miner would fill bigger blocks. Since they don't even fill 1 MB blocks that won't happen. 
Bigger blocks would just give some miners the opportunity to reduce outstanding transactions if they want.

The disagreement with core is spreading fast. First coinbase, than Jeff and Gavin, now paxfull. When the year's end's days are over, we'll see a revolt against core. 
As I said: not confessing to some minor block size increase like 2 MB was psychological stupid from core. Beside their technical brilliance they seem to lack a sense for public relation, community management and wider compromises.
Every government in the world is smart enough to find some kind of compromise, when the political opposition, the economy, the media and the public forums demand a change. Core did not, and if they don't get their mind, this will be their end. Expect popcorn, hardforks and crashes.
@_date: 2015-12-23 10:31:33
I like the faq. As a journalist I know how incredible much work must be behind it.
It also shows that the roadmap is way better than most people think. 
I don't think Lightning will be a solution very soon, and I think it would have been better in term of psychology and public affairs to raise the blocksize to 2 MB.
But so it is, core has decided how to go on, and with some luck we will survice 2016 without serious overload-problems. And if they come - with IBLT and weak blocks core will easily decide to raise the blocksize to 2, maybe even 4 mb.
Even if it is not what the community expected - the roadmap actually is a reason to look forward optimistically.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:39:57
That was not what I meant. It's well known and not special when randomness hits. What I meant are empty blocks while more than 10k transactions remain unconfirmed.

The question is not the best course of action. The question is how to reunite bitcoin again. Leaving bitcoin community split is the worst course of action.
And since there is a big faction that wants bigger blocks a compromise that reunites bitcoins needs to agree on some way of raising the limit. 
Like Aristide Briand said: An agreement is perfect, when every party is unsatisfied.

The OP just asked one question. Can nobody answer it?
I'm not a technician, but I try. Please don't destroy me if I'm wrong but correct me, that will help me to learn more. 
- the most important factor for mining centralization is the algorithm that allows ASICS (special chips made for mining). This hightens the initial investment to mining and increases the needed professionalism.
- in the end, "mining centralization" is just "pool centralization". It's not clear how centralized the hash-power is. It may be that all the miners that spend their hashes to a pool are far more distrubited than you think.
- The connection between blocksize and mining centralization are the orphans. If a miner needs too long to propagate a new block, there is a change, that another miner finds a block in this time and propagates it faster. So the block of the first miner will be invalid and called orphan. Now, the bigger the block, the longer it needs to propagate. This reason make 8 MB blocks extremely risky for miners, and no miner would ever fill such a big block as long as there are not excessives fees inside.
- the orphan mechanism increases the burdens to mining when blocks get bigger. It's a bit like regulation - it increases costs and as a result only big players are able to survice. 
- it is feared that bigger blocks would increase this centralization mechanism.
- Core devs are doing a lot to handle this problem:
- Now I'm technical way out of knowledge to tell you anything, cause it definitely will be wrong, but IBLT and weak / thin blocks are methods, to 1. increase he speed of block propagation 2. decrease the volume of data needed for a miner to propagate his block.
As I said: Whereever I'm wrong, please correct me. 
Edit: This chart  sho shows the number of orphan blocks since april 2014. It seems despite the growing blocks they didn't grow. So my thesis above lacks empirical proof.

Thank you for the review. I don't know if my readers are non-bitcoiners or newbies or experts. I think all of this groups, but I don't know and I wonder why you know better.
About the articles of Zhang Weiwu: He received much love for giving his insight into chinese politics / society, so I think I won't care too much about your critics. Overall I think you don't see the wonderfull structure of the text and the wisdom inside cause you are fixed on finding formular mistakes or violations of simple writing rules. Some of them have survived our non-payed quality management cause ZW writes in english, I edit in english, and than a natural speakers corrects it (you see: much work inside)
And I don't ask anybody who don't like the articles to pay (even if it's a bit unfair cause also bad-written articles transfer information and have hard work behind). BUT I ask why people who like the articles (there are, you won't believe it, many) don't pay. Not one, but 99,99 percent. Not sometimes, but everytime.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:16:08
from my post on Hi, the situation is not very clear. But common believement is currently that you can buy and sell Bitcoins for free as you do it privately. But when you start to do this as a professional, our financial authority claims you have to pay VAT. If we take this absolutely serious, every merchant who accepts Bitcoins should pay a second round of VAT when he sells this bitcoins. Also a market maker should pay VAT. 
Both makes this kind of business completely senseless and even as it was not enforced by today it extremely bad for the german bitcoin scene.

What I don't understand in the report is how did the bot conduct the trade. Every trade needs two parties, and if gox herself bought 10-20 bitcoins every 10 minutes it must have gained 10-20 bitcoins fiat-dept at some traders every 10 minutes. Looks like a very expensive kind of price-manipulation

Calm down everybody. It doesn't make any sense.
If the bot was more than simply faking the API it bought into existing asks.
Then mt.Gox had to add the FIAT of the buy to the account of the sellers.
Why should anybody with a brain do something like this? It's very predictable that this leads to the bankruptcy of the exchange. 
I don't think the report shows the real picture.

"about"-Page was an expression of quandary. Below every article you find a little "about"-box. As far as I know I receive more tips than most other bitcoin-media. But it's far from sufficient to cover only a little part of my income.
About similar stories: sure on my blog you find the "news" you find everywhere else. We need that to keep with the information stream, and I never had the expectation someone gives something for it and would never dare to ask for tips (it's a general problem of the media; they HAVE to revoice themselves for not been thrown of the flow).
But I think I present some stories, mostly in german, that you won't find on other sources (except they copied it from me without my permission). Like my explanation how to destroy bitcoins cryptographically correct :)

1. Writing is hobby and a profession. Publishing regularly good recherched and well-written articles is a full-time job. 
2. Tell me the model. I see three (non-)alternatives: A Paywall excludes most readers from the story and means, as long other magazine earn through ads, the death of any magazine. Building a business on ground of voluntary funds can work sometimes, but mostly not. Let not the reader pay but someone who wants an article to be published: writers loose their freedom and independence. Shamefully most texts today are financed through this method.

Both are top-rated.

Nothing against kraken, but bitstamp handles high volumina since two years and I never heard bad thing while kraken handles a very low volumen for half a year and many people complained about the slow support and more. How can kraken be ranked better than bitstamp?

Thank you for the reviews. 
I am a bit disappointed you didn't include bitcoin.de in your first review, especially when your partner is from Regensburg.
Bitcoin.de offers a very solid service and the best known support in bitcoinland since nearly three years. They have prooven themselve trustworthy over and over again and have played a great role not only to create a bitcoin-market for Europe but to raise awareness and acceptance in Germany.
Also they are continuously enhancing their service.

So everybody who thinks a hardfork to bigger blocks should fork off, because "your" Bitcoin does never hardfork? "No hardfork at all costs"?
Sorry, I'm out. I spent the last two hours to do the same discussions we had in 2016. Always the same arguments, there is zero evolution, only in hostility.
It is really boring, unproductive, a waste of time and makes me angry. 
We seem to be stuck at this stage, both blocksize-wise as discussion-wise and community-wise. So let's see how we can live with it.

nope, we did not give up on that issue. Currently we are working on two fields for realizing this:
- integrating both the fidor api as giropay / sofort to fasten our marketplace-system. Fidor API is technically complicated, but we are cloth to the goal. 
- building a real-time-exchange. This is something like middle-term and won't be realized before q3/4. For this we need additional licences and must restructure our whole platform. We are working on this parallel to all the other improvements we do (like other people engage themself in some hobbies we do this).
Both issue are not realized as fast as we like them to be. But this is no reason for us to not improve our marketplace where we see space. 
You can engage yourself in a user-discussion about improvements for bitcoin.de here: 
It's in german, but there is no reason to not post suggestions in english.

Sure, you can't have an opinion about truth and scientific facts. 
But you for sure can have an opinion on things like bu, onchain vs offchain scaling, on blocksize and more. There is a reason why we debate for so long, there is a reason why miners refuse to adopt segwit, and there is a reason why we have a immense backlog today. And the reason is not misinformation!
That you confuse one perspective of the debate with a truth in math, and the other with nothing but stupidity and misinformation, is exactly the thing I'm raging against. And it is exactly the reason for the split, because on the other side, "the side of the stupid, toxid, haters and misinformed", are just Bitcoin fans that want to scale good old Bitcoin transactions ... and if you invest your time to talk with them, instead of just reading about them on rbitcoin, you might realize that they are not so misinformed and stupid and toxic, but reasonable people with a good financial and intellectual stake in Bitcoin.

Yes, this is one of the reasons why the current consensus modell fails. Either the ecosystem doesn't talk, or it talks wrong, or it doesn't need to listen to each other. Result: no consens, but much fighting.


That's nice. It works for me, too, and I'm happy that the price finally raised (what should be unevitable after the halving). But it will not work as a globally used p2p cash system. Further adoption will only be possible on the cost of cutting other applications. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:19:35


Doesn't change the fact of sybill vs m0deration.


I don't give fault to developers, but to the process. Also coinbase made very clear what they want and was punished with a months long fud-campaign.


Is this the new term for "keeping to terms of an agreement"?
Anyway: Coinbase, Circle, BitPay, Miner at all made very early very clear what they want. And it was not SegWit. 
Anyway: we see where 2 years of trying to adjust the limit with the conventional consensus mechanism has brought us: a growing mempool, a splitted community, and the rejection of a year of work by the miners. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:18:12


Is this the new "I'm right, you are wrong, so shut the fuck up"?
Seriously: You think everybody who is not 100 percent pro SegWit has fallen on "alternative facts"? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:05:57


It's not that I introduced the term but I would define it as PoW-secured, publicly audible and cold wallet capable transactions.


Nearly. Demand is limited by price, but dependend from demand (usability and so on). Last 8 years proof that demand for bitcoin transactions is relatively limited ...

pfff ... why should China own Bitcoin? Haven't you been on boat "miners are not important"?
They produce it, like saudi produces oil or zambia copper. But they don't own it. They don't own the github, they don't own major sites, major exchanges, wallets, and they don't own the keys for the most bitcoins. 
so no, they don't own it. A bit more than Europe (which makes me angry on my European leaders), but I think less than the USA.
For China it is important that Bitcoin doesn't harm the own economy, but I guess they prefer that it is still popular in the rest of the world, as they export it with miners and coins. Incentives for USA and Europe are other, more complicated.

1. hm, don't know. Maybe, maybe not. But doesn't make the other argument less valid.
2. "Those people" - what do you mean? Bitcoin is resistant against a shutdown, sure. But this doesn't mean that a growing level of criminalization or something like this is not very uncomfortable for a lot of people, like investors or companies.

Not just the chinese government might profit from reducing fungibility. Every government. And many banks.
This has nothing to do with just China, see the MIT paper and all this companies offering blockchain analyses.
And many Bitcoin companies could suffer from increased fungibility because they got problems with authorities. Right now there is some kind of balance of anonymity / analyses that enables authorities to hope they can handle it. Increasing fungibility would increase the chance they stopp thinking so and just prohibiting it. This makes it controversial, even in the camp "pro privacy" or so ...

1. is just an assumption you make to make your side look better. Everybody does, but it would be helpful if you realized that this doesn't math the whole picture.
2. You still don't understand me. I don't argue against Schnorr and other privacy / fungibility enhancing technologies.

Don't want to discuss abou details, but "blockstreamCore" is meant to NOT insult all the core devs. (Not that this makes the word better, but it is NOT an attack on core itself. The opposite)
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:03:52


I agree that it SHOULD not be so, and that we SHOULD not divide. But it already happened, and it happens by posts like OP made - implicitly accusing everybody on rbt to ad hominem core - and it happens by posts you see here all the time on BU and rbtc. It is a constant effort of division, to make people who just happen to disagree with the only offchain scaling roadmap, to enemies of Bitcoin. This is the problem, not me talking of sides. 


Ah, nice that you see this. Sorry. Please, even if you don't agree with me or with most people on rbtc - don't accept this those kind of trolls mint the attitude towards the oder side (of the argument)

I did, and, you won't believe it, has been suspected to be employed by your company. 
Harasses and threats however I only got from "your side". From those people which believe that everybody who doesn't agree with this sub's narrative hates core or wants to destroy Bitcoin. On my blog I always get hate, if I just mention things like Lighning, SegWit, fees, bu, because it could go against this narrative. 
There are trolls and haters and lunatics on both side. And I'm sure this debate is manipulated and sidekicked by professional trolls, again, on both sides.
Saying that "they" - rbtc and bu and so on - "hate" core, hate and harrass and trouble every single core dev - that is nothing but hatespeech.
(and maybe one of the reasons, why they ad hominem you. No insult, no legitimation, just an idea)

@_date: 2017-02-11 14:39:12
hehe, but for the fun of it ...


They made Bitcoin big. Is this a problem?


I see it. And it lacks onchain capacity.


So, why was it used as much? Why did any other exchange in 2011/2013 collapse with just a fraction of the load mtGox had? Where has been the better exchange you build? Show some respect for a person who devoted its live for Bitcoin and paid a terrible price for it.


Why? Their hard work made the skills voluntary devs acquire valueable. If devs get nice payments as consultants, it is because the work of exchanges and so on. 


They would be more ok with a real increase. That is the whole point.


You did not read his statement about hardfork-increase vs SegWit. It was very clear.


So, these business' are shitty? They made bitcoin big, but as they don't consent with your opinion, they are "shitty"? 


Do you confuse listening to their opinion with "masturbating"?




Mike Hearn quit because he drowned in toxic shit people shit on him because they couldn't bear that he had another opinion than him. Do you want all these "shitty business" do the same? Would this make you lucky? 


I watch it very closely for some years. Do you think I know nothing because I don't agree with you? Do you think I'm "shitty" too?
I will not continue this discussion. This is beyond the level of ignorance, aggression, toxicity that I can bear to waste my time with. It is really sad how otherwise smart people can get blinded by groupthink and so on. I did never want to persuade you for anything. All I wanted was to come down from your flash and respect the opinion of others. You did not. And this makes me sad.

All these points are boring. We eaten and beaten and shit them for a whole year. This is absolutely 2016. 
And none of your phrases changes the fact that the current consensus-modell to adjust the blocksize has terribly failed. The fact that all this is an endless pushing of faults from miners to devs and so on should make exactly this clear.

you don't understand.
You can engage views and think they are arrogant or stupid in content. Yes. But this is not what you did here.
What you did was to brand the raise of an oposing view itself as arrogant. Do you get the difference? The one is on the content of an argument, the other is on the raise of the argument itself.

Even if you are right we are talking about a demand that does not exist because the technology does not exist. If it happens and becomes a problem, I'm ok with regulating it. But I don't want to choke legitimate usecases to regulate hypothetical parasites.
BTW: Either you use a node, or a third party service, which means that someone knows your IP and you are not anonymous. (I think with high data volume your IP can be easily detected even when using a node).
If you store the data un-prunable, the use of the blockchain as a datastore increases the work to start a node (the only way to do this possibly anonymously). Seems like it destroys itself - or keeps itself alive by increasing number of nodes. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:20:38


Oh, I do!
All you need to be a trustless node is to download new blocks. Currently ~ 4 GB / month. Everythings beyond this depends on your wish to tell other peers what you know about transactions. Nice to have, but not important for your own transaction verification node. Bandwidth is no bottleneck (I only see one bottleck, IBD)


Yeah, this is an opinion. It also is an opinion that every increase of the blocksize costs you monetary souvereinity. imho the opposite is the case, as small blocks push transactions to controlled offchain-solutions and reduce your ability to increase the fungibility of your coins
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:06:07
pfff ... no, it is not. It is against individuals which are assumed to use toxic tactics and lies to choke the capacity of the network. rbtc has never been against core as a group of individual developers. Assuming so is just another point to raise hostility
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:52:06
thanks. Other called me a troll, for asking for the list and for many other things I said which don't fit in the narrative.


Sorry, you did: 


and here again:


This is just the polite way to say: "I'm right, you are wrong, good side, bad side, STFU". 
I know, it is hard to accept the fact that what you think is absolutely true, is not always true, at least not absolutely, but depending on the perspective, and sometimes it is an insult to other people to pretent that his perspective on things is just a waste of neurons. 
And, btw, most things you read here about bu does match every definition of misinformation.

So we are back to 
1. everybody on rbtc is a pig
2. rbtc is the onlies place you can say good things on BU
3. everybody who says something good about BU is a pig
I'm aware that I overplay this. Dramatizing. But it's kind of frustrating to get with you to something we could agree about our attitude and behaviour, just to see to going back to "majority of rbtc doesn't know what they are talking about." I disagree. For some topics, which are not allowed to be discussed open-minded here, the folks there know much more than the crew here.

Ah, catching with words. Ok: SegWit was sold as an scaling improvement regarding the blocksize-limit. But as you say, it is no solution to the blocksize-limit problem - it somehow even makes it worse. While there are solutions - permanent fixes - or the blocksize-limit problem out there, but as your narrative doesn't allow to see the negative sides of segwit, it prohibits your mind to acknowledge any positive of bu.

And yes, I agree that there is too much hate for people talking good on Bitcoin Core and SegWit and Lightning. But on the other side I usually get hate if I criticize these things / don't agree with it. It's both sided, and if people like you would realize this, we would be on a good path forward. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:08:24
it depends on what you want to do.
If you have a fidor-account bitcoin.de has some impressive advantages with the expresstrade that enables you to buy bitcoins within seconds.
All of the three exchanges seem to be serious. Circle seems to act most restrictive and random with aml/kyc, as far as reddit tells. Kraken is in the US, what could become a problem to enforce your rights in case of legal problems / insolvency etc. 
If you want to save fees circle is best, followed by kraken. bitcoin.de is the most expensive (with 0,5% fee), but they are famous for providing the best customer service. Along with their marketplace-modell they provide the highest degree of privacy.
I personaly love bitcoin.de the most. Never had problems with them, I know the people that work there and they are the most serious and trustworthy people I ever meet in business (even outside the bitcoin space). I am also extremely impressed that they continue to work in such a highly legal restricted space like germany. Also I am impressed with all that improvements they continuosly provide. 
But all of them are good choices. In europe buying bitcoins means to choose between the best services available worldwide.

why? 
Core = ~100 contributors to bitcoin
Blockstream Core = ~10 contributors, either employed by blockstream or strongly supporting the course of these.
What is your problem when rbtc does not attack the whole core but only a part of core defined by their closeness to blockstream? Shouldn't you wecome it?
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:58:24


No, how did you learn that? I just said that cash is heavily restricted and that we should not expect that bitcoins is treated better.


So, why do we argue about this? Confidential Transactions are incompatible with AML/KYC, that's the whole point. 


How come it you think I "obviously" want anything? I just say that things like confidential transactions will break the current regulatory deal and are a big risk that bitcoin will be banned.

iPhone is made.
Better you'd say "e-mobility".
But as you might know, bitcoin currently has a similar traction like e-mobility. Lightning is like saying, e-mobility can't scale, we need to send energy through the air, and until this is done, we don't build new energy-stations to charge the cars. It surely would help a lot for the fossil industry.

cool! Nice hat you did this! 
Then you know that it is not the standard configuration of access to the blockchain to up- and download huge chunks of data anonymously.
Sure, you can use a full node and tor to implement data in the blockchain, but both assumes a highy sophisticated user and thus seriously limits demand.
(also your demand idea doesn't take pruning and IBD into effect.)
If you believe in some school of economics you can in theory say there is unlimited demand for data storage on the blockchain. But in reality it is not.

It was just a rough calculation, and yes, you are right, it might be to less. 
Make it 5 or 6 or 8 GB or, if you like, 20 GB. Or 50 or 100 or 200 kbit/sec. The bandwidth requirements to have a node that is able to verify a payment after you made the initial sync is ridiculous. Same goes for CPU. Absolutely no reason to not raise the limit immediately to 10 or 20 MB. Without any risk. 


Yeah, me too. This is why I oppose the current roadmap which considers onchain scaling as a problem instead of a chance / solution. 


Who asked for "infinitely scale"? I guess the demand for something like Bitcoin is limited. People have a dozen of options to pay at the supermarket or in the pub, I think bitcoin will forever be the least convenient of it. And this is ok. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to scale to VISA-level. (I guess if it ever needed, it would be worth so much, that everybody who invested today could buy a server-farm for his node; and likely it would be outlawed because it threatens tax regime and central banks). It would just be nice if it was allowed to scale to a level that satisfies the current demand. Or the demand of the next five years.
I guess if we had blocks max 8 mb, or, let's say 20 MB, it would be enough forever. Or for a very long time, untill a very insecure and rich future ... And if it is not enough, we still can use other coins and offchain solution. 


Hm? What do you mean? The more I learn about Lightning, the less exciting and relevant the system becomes for me ... 
 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:44:23


How many E-Mail-providers do we have?
All you'll need to host such a node as a datacentre is ... a datacentre ... and in the foreseeable future it will be enough to have a big harddisc and a good bandwith. I think everyone in japan could host a big node up to something like 50 MB blocks today.
But, yeah, in the far future, when Bitcoin is the world's money, nodes can be so big that they need datacentres. But in that case every kind of usable transaction layer would need datacentrer-hubs, so the difference in terms of censorship resistance is not so big. 
And even then there remains a big difference in the requirement to host a bank and to host a node. It will be far easier to host a node as a datacentre than to own a bank.
So, I'm not eager to see this scenario play out and I'm very open to alternative approaches to scaling, but I don't see this scenario as a failure.

Is it a final solution? No. At best two years, than another bump.
Does it make a final solution easier or less controversial? No, as a future hardfork either increases spam attack vector to 2x transaction capacity or kicks the utxo reducement incentive, it will be more controversial than now.
So. No brainer?

Yes, exactly this part. I even quoted it some time on my blog.


That's what Bitcoin does. 


That's what Satoshi Nakamoto did. 


I don't think so. 
Bruce Schneider said you can't pretend obersvation, neither in real nor in electronic live, but you can prevend mass surveillance by making it harder (using tor, fake names, encryption, etc.). Bitcoin in its current shape prevents mass surveillance, cause there are no names in the blockchain. 
I even think if you use some mixers, altcoins or joinmarkets Bitcoin in its current shape is able to prevent observation. At least you need many man-hours to observe the financial acting of an individual, and sometimes it's not even possible at all. 
After all, Bitcoin's privacy is good enough for a flourishing black market in the net, for ransomware and for the usual scammer every two weeks.  You never get 100 percent; most people who are not satisfied with less than 100 percent loose it all.

I read it. Nothing new, the same arguments I already didn''t eat. 
I wished I had RBF in my Wallet, really with a gui, last week. But than I thought about what would happen if we have transactions with RBF delayed for days. A merchant would never know if a transaction really was made. This would have been an interesting scenario to talk about instead of teaching people that "accepting 0-conf transaction is alway unwise". 
Maybe I have a problem with your "journalism". You pretend - maybe think - you are objective, but in fact you are very very biased. 
I'm maybe the opposite. I tell my readers that I'm biased and like bigger blocks, but then I try to be as objective as possible and I try explicitly to show the opinion of "small blockers" without comments. If a reader complains about me being objective, I think, ok, that was not good, and I change my article and say sorry to the readers because I disapointed his trust in my objectivism. (I write german blog bitcoinblog.de)
You, my "collegue", tell your readers that you are not biased but "factual". I think you believe it, because you think there is this one single truth. But this should every "journalist" know: The world is too big for one truth, and it is never true that one party is ever right and another party ever wrong. This world-view is incompatible with real journalism. 
Real journalists tell their readers when they have a position. They announce it as a category. Take a look in the herald tribune. It's no problem to have an opinion and be not objective, many journalist do this all day, but, and this is the whole point, they don't tell their readers they are objective. They say: Listen, this is my opinion. 
You are good in explaining things - loved your Segwit article - with a strong touch to defending everything core says / does. Stand to it and stop pretending you are objective. 
And, PS, you should have told your readers, when you discuss RBF, that it's also possible to use Chield-pay-for-parents or simply delete a transaction from your own mempool and try to broadcast another tx. Both works sometimes, and an optical interface for this in the wallet would have made a good job during the whole spam mess without killing zero-conf and making low-fee-transaction in a strange state between ok and not ok.

We have this kind of federated blockchains. BigchainDB works like this, also ripple. 
This is a great example of something I noticed: It seems to become "consensus" (of the experts) that it was an accident that p2p currencies have miners and that the "right way" to to p2p-transactions should be done without miners. 


I don't think so. I think if the transaction capability of the system is moved to federated sidechains / sublayers their owners will have much more controll about my funds and transactions than node-operators. Also I think all this solutions doesn't provide the same security than a onchain transaction (if they would, we'd never needed bitcoin in the first place).
Sorry for cherry-picking.
As I said: I'm ok with payment layers and so on, but I just don't think they are much better than nodes as datacentres, to some parts worse, and I think it's insane to break bitcoins capability as a payment networks because we expect to get some kind of payment layers in some future.

I don't know any study about bandwidth requirement referring to current technology (onliest is I think more than 2 years old). That there is none, but we think to talk about so called "facts" is another shame of this whole debate. 
You could either run core with --blocksonly, or BU with a complete choke of the upload traffic. Should be an interesting experiment. 


Why did you think? And when?


Nice that you agree. Honestly, I have no clue how fees will play out. Maybe at some point we have to accept that hasrate goes down, or that miners build cartells, or that miners offer further services, maybe some we don't like. How this plays out is not a technical thing, but economy. 


Hm. There are so many things about SegWit which are problematic. From technical and political points of view. A starer / summary: SegWit was explicitly introduced as a replacement of a hardfork increase, and both its economical regulatational rules as its technology make future hardforks not easier, but harder. So fear is that SegWit will just help to not increase limit with demand. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:22:12


you don't know really much about the system, do you?
Anyway: I'm totally not for letting people store whatever data they want in the blockchain, and if this happens on a massive scale I'm all for regulating it out. But I'm not for breaking the payment system as a side effect of regulating a problem that does not exist by now and is unsure to ever exist at all.

You assume a velocity of 7160. Fiat-money usually has a velocity of 1,5 - 9.

You can argue that the message is wrong, but not the existence of the message. Imho we saw more than two years "agreeiing on exactly how to accomplish it", and there has been no progress.

@_date: 2017-02-09 09:46:23
Sure I engage the argument. For example:


I argue that this can be translated into: Bitcoin doesn't make sense. You suggest to regulate Bitcoin to prevent some damage which you suppose results from its basis design. While it is not given that demand will ever reach a level which triggers this damage.


I wouldn't say "there needs", but I'd like to see them. But all proposals I saw by now are imho not capable as a substitute of onchain transactions. I hope we get them, but I think Bitcoin would be able to work without.


I don't think so. If a proposal enables the system to reach an emergent consensus about the blocksize, it would be pretty ideal longterm (this doesn't mean that BU has the perfect solution. But imho the perfect vision)

I'm disapointed to see Nick Szabo posting a red herring.
As a public database I'm sure people will pay hundreds of dollars to write some message in the blockchain. (Loveletters, constitutions, poems, prayers, contracts ...) 
But bitcoin is not a notary but a transaction network. A real fee market will outcompete transactions in favor of the notary. How much will you pay to sign your marriage - and how much to do a payment?
Without money the blockckain has no value and the notary is broken.

But if a transaction with a correct fee is propagated to some hundred nodes and the sender uses a smartphone zero conf works amazingly well.

Hei, that is one of the first answers here I think to be worth discussing. Thank you. 


With 2WP Sidechains I'm not sure, since Blockstream showed no idea to design them as a public chain. Private Sidechains are the same as the current system, maybe worse.
Lighning doesn't exist. Why Voting pools like stashcrypto are not used is something I wonder for month. 


The current system: you have no private keys, your money is not real, but a credit, and your bank has a monopol on transacting your money.
A world with nodes-as-datacentres: you have your private key, your money is real, you can build your raw transaction at home and you can choose the node-provider to let it broadcast.


What if Lightning transaction cost money? What if bitcoin-transactions cost money?
I rather think that nodes-as-datacentres would not cost money but find some way to do some advertising or sell premium options like chargebacks via rbf, fast transaction and so on. I mean, usually you need a datacentre to broadcast E-Mails, but usually E-Mails are still free and way more effective and decentralized than the old post system. 
**Edit**: That said, I don't want Nodes as datacentres and would be said to shutdown my node at home. But I'm a bit sick of everybody here pretenting like this is a no-go. It feels like a big lack of imagination.


I don't think there are currently plans for doing merged-mined sidechains. This requiered a natural token of a sidechain. 


It would be ok. But after doing a transaction on a sidechain - or accepting bitcoins on a sidechain - my bitcoins are not on the real blockchain. So I would prefer a modell where I can't access directly to the real blockchain but have my bitcoins on it.


I have to use multisig with LN, so I'm not the real and only owner of my coins. It is more secure than banking today, both lightning and voting pools, and I never said it is worse, but it is not bitcoin the transaction system. It's one more layer, one more step to start paying, one more act of complexity, and I think never ever will enough people use it to legitimate its existance. But maybe I'm wrong ...

how often do we need to discuss this?
If you want to know, go on the *other sub* or *the other forum* and read what people say.
In short:
- a softfork sw is not a scaling solution. It gives ~1.8 mb but sets the network on the risk of 4 mb. In fact, it's a step back for future onchain scaling.
- core's plan is crawling on the minimum limits. SW 1.8mb, later a hf to maybe 2 mb (if not 1.5) - **this is no plan for success**. It limits bitcoins potential massively. Chances are high that investment in bitcoin dries out (since there is no potential)
And, please, don't say lightning or sidechains. Neither of it is ready as bitcoin was ready in 2009. Waiting now for lightning or something else to provide scalability is like buying bitcoins from satoshi in 2005.

A first step would be to stop calling it "the currency of the internet".

Yeah. After the first (or second?) Scaling Workshop most "Big Blockers" have been willing, but far from happy, to accept some kind of compromise of SW + 2 or 4 MB Blocks. This was the general expectation; it would have brought enought time untill either LN is ready (and used) or there is a sustainable solution found.
PS: Calling Big Blockers "anti core side" is another conspiracy / propaganda talking point. Doesn't help. Some are against some individuals of core, but nobody is against core as a whole.

Finite is not the same as scarce
Demand is not the same as supply
Miners are not the same as pools
and cheap is not the same as decentralized
Can you define decentralism? E.G. what number of nodes defines a decentralized network? And at what cost to run a node decentralism fades? If you can't define decentralism, your dogma consists of two words you don't understand. Think by yourself!

good comment, important points about "scaling" and "scalability".


I don't think this changes anything in the efficiency, because the data remains the same. It may open possibilities to improve scalability, but it doesn't provide them (if I'm not wrong)


Yes. Thinblocks do, pruning does, blocksonly does, the new libsec does, a planned blocktorrent does, iblt does. There have been so much improvements of scalability in the past weeks, and there will be as much in the coming month. 
(while it's really sad that one, thinblocks, an upgrade reducing bandwith of nodes significantly, is only used by ~90 nodes)

hello! 
Only reason rbtc was made was to have a place where you can talk about things like bu without being randomly delayed or moderated. Accept this, or we don't need to talk. 
I agree, it escalated. It became toxic, for core devs, and for people like you (I like your comments, btw, I always read them).
But the sole reason, why rbtc exists, is that it became offtopic to talk about onchain scaling on moderated forums. Don't argue about semantics and details. This is a fact.
What I read here, in this sub, about rbtc and "them" and so on, is an insult to me. I don't ad hominem or insult anybody, and I don't think that this should be done. Ad hominem has never been helpful.

Thanks again ...


Yeah, maybe, but most people don't update permanently. There are bitcoin-users that don't hang out on reddit every day but just use bitcoin as a mean of payment.  For example I lost my playstore account for a tablet and are unable to update mycelium. But it's no problem, since mycelium works fine.


No. I don't buy this. In fact, this is the most stupidest argument in the whole debate and I really beg you to abandon it.
I don't know how to doublespend, my friends don't know. It's a hack. With RBF it's in the gui. 
In the 90ties there have been manipulated cards for phone boxes (I think Kim Dotcom was involved). But the cards did still work for the telefone companies and no-one said: it's already vulnerable, let's make cheating a standard in every card.
You don't hack your client to pay a beer or to download some file for free. But if it's in the gui, maybe many more people use it to cheat. Peter Todd will not use his hacking-tool to cheat on localbitcoins; but scammers will use the rbf-gui.


I meant if double spent is possible on the smartphone without rbf. With rbf you maybe don't need to connect remotely wih your pc, cause double-spending is part of the gui. But is the "old" double spent like Peter Todd made it possible with a smartphone? If not, 0-conf-tx are secure in real life.


Ok, thanks. 
Can you please explain why it's so necessary to implement RBF while there is a large resistance from the community and while you by yourself admit that it will lead to double-spending opportunities and chaos with non-updated software? 
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:03:02
Ok. 
I think "censorship resistance" mean that nobody in the whole world can prevent that I send a transaction to who I want, and nobody can take my bitcoins. This is a fact, no theory, and it is the reason bitcoin has a value.
I see it so: as long as bitcoin is not globally banned, it is censorship resistance. If it is globally banned, it maybe will survice, but it's value will shrink so much, that it's censorship nature will have no longer any use.

Ok, let's define currency:






According to those definitions a currency is a **medium of exchange**. A settlement network is not a medium of exchange. If Bitcoin can't scale - I don't believe this but accept the consensus here - than it is a currency on a very small scale, for the daily use of less than 1 mio people. That's ok. But it is not **the currency of the internet**
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:42:48
the current consensus mechanism for blocksize is to let some developers examine, discuss, decide and hope the ecosystem eats it. As the rejection of SW, Luke's proposal, the deadlock after ~2y of discussion and the split of the community indicates, this mechanism is broken to enable any kind of *meaningful* onchain scaling.
I know, there are people happy about this, in the name of "immutability". But for those who want Bitcoin to succeed as a worldwide p2p-cash this is a major failure.

I don't know who exactly, but representatives of the companies of the DCG made very clear, after showing a great deal of patience for more than two years, that they are unsatisfied with the situation and that it starts to harm their business. What's so hard to get about it?
I'm really sick of hearing over and over that SegWit is the better solution for scaling, that there are ZERO disadvantages and that everybody denying it is technically dumb. Pro SW is that it is a Softfork and that it fixes quadratic signature validation. Contra is that transaction increase in size, that the roll out is likely a mess and, most important, that it is nothing but a short bumb and not in any way a sustainable solution. So, there are reasons for and there are reasons against SegWit. Plz stop painting this stupid b/w picture and insult the leaders of important bitcoin businesses with the idea they did not examine pro / con and are just technically dumb.
This is the same hypocrises as to say Mt. Gox was "extremely bad from technical perspective." They have been by far the technically most advanced exchange for years, and there is nearly no one who was as brillant in a technical way as Mark Karpeless when it comes to bitcoin. I'm pretty sure Bitcoin would have not reached its current hights without mtgox. But yeah, they failed, so it's pretty easy to call him technically dumb. 
And, next point, DO SOMETHING: The companies around DCG do something. Every single of the CEOs risked his wealth and his freedom and worked extremely hard and much to give your bitcoin wealth. Is this not enough for you?
And WRT Trezor, Slush and so on. Coinbase and Xapo have been very clear they want an increase, Trezor made also very clear they liked an increase, Electrum is not a business, but one of its most sophisticated devs is in "a team not to be named", and BitcoinJ is the chield of someone who was very clear about his preferences ...

Yes, that's sad, but true. It's just a confusion on companies trying to use bitcoin for micropayment.

Yes, we differ in this opinion, but as I said several times: I don't wish nodes to be hosted in datacentres. I love hosting my own node.
I just don't want the maybe possible perspective of nodes becoming datacentres in a far future to be the ghost the breaks bitcoin as a payment system today. 
Unfortunately it does, and so we are back that the new consensus about what bitcoin is breaks nearly every promise we've seen in the last years.

But I can't judge this, so I leave it as a hypothesis. I'm just sure that relevance in current development is not perfectly equal to skills.

it's a misconception to compare thinblocks with the relay network. The relay network may be the better solutions for miners to communicate about blogs - to get their blogs to nodes - but what thinblocks does, is, it reduces the bandwith peaks of a nodes by something like 90 percent.

How many E-Mail-provider do we need to make E-Mails not to be trivially censorable by governments? 


Do we have any proof about this? Pool-concentration is imho not really concerning.


So ... do you remember why some closed E-Mail-protocolls failed? What you describe is more like Whatsapp (coinbase offchain or liquid sidechain) that bitcoin / Email the protocoll. 


I think you miss some point.
Liquid is a federated blockchain. The bigchainDB-thing is a federated blockchain. Also everledger seems to become a federated blockchain, and ripple like it was made is similar to a federated blockchain. A condition of being federated is that you need an invitation to host a node. Also I think federared blockchains are not really necessary and just a little step better then a shared dropbox-account.
But as long as the protocoll is open and everybody who is able to run a datacentre can host a node it is not federated. It is still open, and if people pay for the api of a datacentre-node we could even end up more decentralized than today.

There's no difference when you only can use bitcoin by sidechains. If we ever reach visa-level, be it lightning or sidechains or voting pools, there will be no way around big companies hosting nodes / payment hubs. 
The major difference is that with the big-nodes-scenario we can continue to use bitcoin as a payment-network, maybe forever without big nodes, while the small-nodes-lightning-model requires us to stop thinking bitcoin as a payment network NOW and waiting for LN, while we don't know if there will ever be enough demand for it.


What's the meaning of OTOH? Those sidechains would be private, you are aware of it? And where do you cut the line which transactions should use private sidechains and which can enjoy the public blockchain?


Realistically it is 50x the current capacity, so more like 100-150 tps. It's far from bitcoins current demand, and I don't really think that we will ever ever have this demand ... and this is a very bad reason to stopp catching the demand now (but let's not discuss this point, I made it too often and know I can't change your mind)


Do you consider a world where your bank is not able to transact your money without you building a transaction a dystopia? 
(but this is your assumption that only large cooperation can host a big node, while I think it more like E-Mails ...*)
*nearly every online-companie today has stopped to delete data, cause it is more expensive to crawl data to divide what is needed and not as to just save it. So I think harddisk will not be a problem, especially as we have things like pruning right now.

Lightning is not here. If it is here we can call bitcoin again the currency of the internet. 
In its current form it has not the potencial to serve as a currency for something like "the internet". Saying this in the sidebar is a false promise. 
In it's current design it is also not capable of processing enough payments that any acceptance at any kind of shop and for any kind of thing or any other service using bitcoin for any cool thing is simply not noteworthy because there is no transaction volume possible. 
Never again on he blockchain. If we find the killer app between today and the arriving of lightning, it will not be worth a note, because the killer app can't use bitcoin. No matter what fee it pays - there is no space for a killer app.

short version: they are not against SegWit because it enables Schnorr and so on. They are against SegWit because it seems to substitute a longterm adjustment of the blocksize parameter. It would be helpful for this debate when this is accepted.
Longer version: I agree, that this debate is f****d up. But let's not spin stories like this. And, if you and I like it or not, the decision to introduce more privacy in Bitcoin's protocoll is controversial. It introduces a new reason for the states to outlaw it. It changes or breaks the rules of the game of "anonymity vs. law investigation".

Hi, interesting.
I think there are so many differences in our perspective, what I consider a good thing. I'll try to explain it - this is no offense, just an explanation, why your correct with:


Most importantly: You think blocks should be full and we need a fee market. I don't think this is necessary at this time. We shouldn't need a mempool management at this ime. If someone sends a tx without fee, he has to wait.
This question has be discussed so much, but planning rbf as an instrument for the case of full block is imho not the best attitude towards the users. RBF will hinder the next version of core to be downloaded by many. I for myself will look for a version that identifies and blocks rbf-transactions.


No, bitcoin is a meritocraty or a oligarchy. Nodes and miners and companies decide. Devs only suppose things.


Hmm .... so it's already out there? To activate it miners need to find the support of nodes. Without nodes activating rbf it won't work. The risk is some peter todd connecting directly to one miner uses it to double spend, but the Peter Todds can already double-spent. So, if I understand correctly, there is no risk in not activating it. 


Maybe I'm missing something, but the only feature I get is to chargeback a tx with too low fee. It's not that I think this generally to be bad, there are some moments when it could be usefull. 
But in generel it's again a usecase that is only of major relevance if blocks are full. And here we are back in the old issue ... 
In my view, rbf is something that
- deepens the chasm between core-developer and community 
- is currently of a minor usefullness
- has properties of a softfork (cause it makes not updated nodes vulnerable)
- and has the risk to result in mass-double-spends in face-to-face-transactions

Maybe you didn't noticed, but cash is heavily restricted and more year by year. if you adobt the cash restrictions of france and italy to bitcoin it would mean that you are not allowed to widthdraw more than 500€ in BTC from an exchange a day. E. G. 
One difference law enforcement knows really well is that cash is physical. It's not easy to smuggle 100.000 € in Cash to Egypt. 
As I said: Bitcoin has privacy, but an extent of privacy that is to some kind "fair" against Law Enforcement. 
You obviously want to break this unspoken deal with confidential transactions and declare war on authorities by destroying every regulation they deployed.
And than you hope on the goodwill of Law Enforcement to be as nice to bitcoin as they are to cash, and you hope they are stupid enough to not learn what you already learned, that Bitcoin has other properties than cash, that make them less controllable etc.
@_date: 2016-03-07 11:49:58
Either it is a currency - something you can use to pay -  or it is a settlement-layer - something you can lock coins to use them for paying.

But yes, I think if ln is ready in 6 month, I'd still prefer onchain transactions and still would feel cheated to be forced in some kind of pseudo-ripple instead of the bitcoin I'd like.
But if it works I'd be ok with it, I think.
@_date: 2016-01-16 11:10:40


That may be an endless point of discussion. You are sure that it is so, but you didn't succeed in convincing the economy that now supports classic on a massiv scale.
Maybe it is because the need for ending mallebility, upgradeable script etc. seems not so urgent as the need to increase capacity limit (atm: last blocks all over 900kb and more than 8000 unconfirmed transactions). And while SW may be the better solution as a paket, regarding just the capacity increase a blocksize increase seems to be considered as the better solution by many actors of the economy.
Why? 
- it doubles capacity by activation. (as you know, SW won't do this)
- it doesn't force the companies to change their transaction system
- it is a hardfork and by this clear. e. G.: when we activate SW, and I send a SW-transaction to someone who didn't upgrade - will he be able to receive it? What happens when a miner don't updates? That's a lot of insecurity SW brings with.

good point. Bitcoin news have the same dilemma like every other news: they lack money. It's a hard and fulltime job to publish regularly deeply recherched and well written articles. 
But my experience as a editor is unfortunately no one is willing to pay for articles. For some of the readers it's even to much to make them click through more-pager. Bitcoin makes paywalls and tipping incredibly easy both for publishers and readers, but still no one spends.
Do you really wonder news are looking around for finding someone to finance them?

Gavin lead Bitcoin development for some years. I think it's out of question that he made something right.


Yeah, that's right. But ... since when? During the last 12-15 month - some month after a company was build - a camp building began. Name it "pragmatists" vs "decentralists" or andresen/hearn vs maxwell/luke, like you want to call it, but in the end the "decentralists" won and "pragmatists" like Gavin, Mike and Jeff left core development.
Assuming this is a win for core, loosing three very experienced developers, seems someway out of touch with reality.
I recently did some recherche about mempool-limitation and found an article of mike. He implemented it long ago in ex-te, and also ex-te implemented a protection against Monster-transactions. So I think he made some good things. 
Also I heard from some developers they stopped sending proposals and ideas to core because the atmosphere is too toxic and narrow.

Like your comment!


I think that is reasonable, but it holds some risks, like bitcoin being kept small while a fedcoin replacing it's function as digital cash.


Pfff ... If Andreas took position against GMax he would get a shitstorm. Daily business here. There are some very active people on social media that separate along idealogical lines. Day for day.


This was in 2013 / early 2014. I liked it. In this time we thought bitcoin is the better paypal / credit card. Now we changed quickly to the new mantra is "Bitcoin can't compete with VISA, it can't scale". 


He has his reasons that are "not wrong". If Andreas was right and some other cryptocurrency would fill that gap, everything would be fine. But currently the world still equals cryptocurrency with bitcoin and so it is that "cryptocurrencies" can't compete with visa.
Maybe the root of the problem is, that some people see bitcoin as something like an open, decentral and pseudonymous paypal, while other people see it as an open, decentral and pseudonymous EURO. The new consens is, that bitcoin is a bad competitor to paypal, but a good competitor to the Euro. 


Yeah. It simply won't happen untill either Lightning or some fedcoin arrives.  We have peak blockspace; cryptocurrencies are on it's limits; if you find a killer app tomorrow, it would be not worth anything. 
As I think it hard to imagine a userfriendly implementation of Lightning I fear in reality a fedcoin will serve the unbanked and keep them dependent on big companies.


I'm not sure. In reality it may end up with people not using free cryptocurrencies but federated blockchains. 


Don't worry. Everything is all right :)

in that sense as you usually suppose that something that is called "the currency of the internet" should be capable of being used to pay.
I'm not excessively eager of enforcing some x megabyte by a hf on the price of splitting the community. But saying, officially, we're nearly peak blockspace, and have to use transactions with renewable blockspace, is a tough statement.
It's like as we had started industrialization with climate scientists in controll. It's a strong regulation and a paradigma shift.

Read the quote and ask three questions:
1. What's the business modell of Blockstream/PwC? Yes: Sell Sidechains.
2. Does the current protocoll allow sidechains? No: It doesn't.
3. What does blockstream/PwC need to do to unlock their asset? Yes: change the protocoll.
I don't say that this is bad for bitcoin - maybe it's good - and I don't say that there is a direct conflict of interest - or that this kind of potential conflict of interest needs to do harm to bitcoin:
But when Blockstream/PwCs business relies on change of the protocoll, there should be some talk in an open community. This is some point blockstream/PwC needs to address if they want the community to keep following them.

Yes, it would. I think blockchain sync is currently the most pressing issue. I heard several complaints of new users that the syncing stopped at some moment, after days of doing so, and then they had to begin at genesis. 
Most plausible explanation is that it was a tiny tiny damage in the ram that came into effect after millions of signature validations. 
Just reacting on this, by don't forcing people to stopp from the beginning, would be a great start.-

Imho it was a mistake to miss opportunities two years ago. 
And imho there is a better option available, and some miner vote for it. Best would be a common attempt to make this option better, more secure, as it represents the best vision mid- and longterm (while SegWit represents no vision mid/longterm I'm interested in)

this may be correct, as long as it is banned in banned in only one jurisdictation and has a real usage, e. G. it's banned in romania and you can use it to buy thing on german shops you can't buy with credit cards.
But when Bitcoin is banned everywhere and in no shop accepted and not easily exchanged against other currency, it looses a major part of its usefullness while using it becomes more dangerous.

With no onchain scaling bitcoin will be no payment processing system at all. No low value, no medium value, no high value. Not with that capacity. 
But I agree that eth / dgc can take micropayments. Bitcoin doesn't need this. I also agree that a testing of a fee event is by itself not a bad thing. 
I just don't agree with the sentment of bitcoin being a settlement network instead of a payment system. But I repeat myself too often. 


Ok. I'm just free to say I prefer this or that over that or this without investing in anything of it. I like the idea of bitcoin, I write a popular blog about bitcoin, but my investment is small compared to that of others. 


Because eth are processed on a real blockchain not a sidechain. Because I don't trust the concept of a sidechain, and it's not integrated in any wallet yet and will not be in the foreseeable future. Because eth is here, right now, many dapps are developed. Because ethereum is the currency tailored for smart contracts. Why should I use anything else if I want smart contracts? With shapeshift you can change your bitcoins in ethereum in a couple of minutes. 
Bitcoin pirating ethereums code is quiet similar as Metallica releasing a new album and everyone praised them for beeing "nearly as good as in old times". Ok, bad comparison, but similarity is that bitcoin doesn't need ethereum-like-features, because it is a store of value AND a payment system and there is no reason to compete here while destroying one of bitcoin's main features ... 


Yeah, that's a good point. Good old real world problem that makes you needing a notary with or without blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:59:28
I did not invest in ethereum. I think eth currently is heavily overprized. 


So you think the payment-feature is just unnecessary garbage? 


Again: neither ln nor public sidechains nor voting pools are available right now. And cc is insecure and has privacy flaws. 


if you think so. The truth is people are currently paying very very much money for such registrations, and if it goes blockchain they are ok with fees up to 100 dollar.
But you like the blockchain neither used for payments nor for registrations. 


You misunderstood completely. Step by Step: 1. registration transactions have no problem paying fees like 100 dollar. 2. no monetary transaction pays fees like 100 Dollar. 3. bitcoin is not used for monetary transactions and looses its value. 4. bitcoin is no longer secure and no longer used by notary transactions 5. bitcoin is dead.


Please, stop this bullshit-personal-insults. I don't invested in ethereum. Just answer my question why anybody should first by bitcoin, take it on a sidechain and then build smart contracts, when he can just use eth?

Maybe you are right, maybe not. All we can do is speculating, what blockstream-pwc-core wants and aims.
All we know is their press release says they sell sidechains.
And we know that sidechains need changes in the protocoll. So we know that core-pwc has personal incentives to prefere one kind of protocoll change above another. 
This screams for a conflict of interest. And core-pwc doesn't even needs to talk about this? And you swap it away with some comments how greedy coinbase is?

My comment was just sarcasm on your quote. Why can't you praise someone's work without disrespecting other people's practices?
I love science. But I know that it is one piece of the whole. And currently Bitcoin is in front of proofing the world that it can't scale. If this goes on for some month, working at capacity limits, investors waiting for bitcoin to become real money will be lost forever. So, I love science. But there have been discussions, bips, peer reviews, simulations, conferences for more than a year; it has never been rocket science to extrapolate the transaction growth to find out that capacity limit is close.
So I love science, but this is a really bad moment to disrespect the practice.

Where have you been the last weeks?
It's easy:
- Segwit gives ~1.7 MB Blocks, IF the whole network uses it. More realistic are 1.5 MB Blocks during 2016. Some people doubt this is enough. 
- Segwit is complicated, it's a big chance to the protocoll, it demands exchanges, wallets etc. to do big changes in their systems
- even the devs are no longer sure, if a Segwit Softfork is secure. See here 
- Segwit gives 1.8 MB, but need to prepare for 4 MB, since that "real" blocksize will be possible with some kind of transactions. So, if you want in the future regular blocks with a capacity of 8 MB, you'll need a network secure enough for ~ 20 MB. 
- in short: the community wants bitcoin to scale, and segwit seems a more complicated and insecure but less effective method to achieve more scalability.

@_date: 2016-01-07 06:40:19
No need to circlejerk around "privacy is better than blocksize".
We'll need something like CT, no doubt, BUT
At the Moment privacy is "ok". It's strong enough to break financial mass surveillance and there are way enough means of mixing that it stopps personal obersavation.
So: 
privacy = ok
blocksize != ok
Further I see two problems / risks, CT could raise IF IT WORKS PERFECT
1. it's an invitation to ban bitcoin. You may not now, but currently most authorities are in a equilibrium, where many hardliners want's to ban it ASAP while their younger collegues argue that they can deal with Bitcoin because it has a fair share of transparency. CT risks to destroy this balance. 
2. CT could work far better than joinmarkets. But since joinmarket is at the moment the only known way to incentivize node, this comes with an disadvantage. In fact, if you implement CT now you will loose some nodes. The better solution would be to implement joinmarkets in Core. This would bring us more privacy AND more decentralization of nodes.

@_date: 2016-01-13 16:04:13
Thank you. 


I don't talk of relying, I talk of receiving. Old nodes don't know that they receive a rbf-transaction, right?


Sure, nobody is affected if he doesn't accept zero-conf, that's already known. But it's kind of uncomfortable to wait outside or in a café till a transaction is confirmed (what can last up to an hour). Thus it's common practice to accept confirmations without fee on localbitcoins. To be honest, I strongly disagree with the opinion that zero-conf-transactions should never be made. It's a trade-off, and it seems that rbf changes this trade-off, at least for old nodes, in a very bad style.
Also as far as I know it's nearly impossible to do a double spend with a smart phone / any mobile device.


I see it's a mix of technolgical problems and this reason:


If the real goal of RBF is to "compress" transactions - which should be a very minor use case - and you are willing to kill zero-conf on older nodes for it - this is a bad trade-off.

You realize that the price of "notary on the blockchain" will be the price of a transaction if we don't scale onchain?
How much are you willing to pay for your wedding-certificate / your land-registration? The way is that notary-transactions that add no value to bitcoin itself will outcompete financial transations soon. (Yes, raising the blocksize to eternity is also no solution. Better would be something like extra-fees on transactions with a messgae / op_return)


Since bitcoin does not look at the value of a transaction but at the space it needs, this fee would fit for every transaction. Nobody will use bitcoin for anything with it.


As I said: the fees will only be paid by notary-transactions like a registration that costs in real live some hundred dollars. It will never not be used by monetary transactions. 


Is it ready? Can it be used? How is it mined / secured? Sorry, don't followed it, since if I'd want to use a smartcontract I'd prefer to use fiat --&gt; eth instead of fiat --&gt; btc --&gt; rootstock. 


How is the sidechain secured? If not by miners but federated nodes, you don't need a blockchain at all / you don't need the blockchain to be a sidechain of bitcoin. No sense at all since a sidechain can't provide the security bitcoin provides.


As I wrote: hard disk is so cheap that most internet companies just save everything instead of selecting files to delete AND: we have pruning. Harddisk is no problematic variable for it.

I heard this so often, and it still doesn't get better. 


Arrg. Who said the world wants to use bitcoin at all? By now we just know that demand will soon be higher than blockspace. If the trend continuous we have 10 mb blocks in 10 years. No problem at all.


Why not? If nodes become data centres, that we have node centralization, for sure, but it will be far better than the current banking system, since you still can keep your private key and choose from which node you take the API. Also if we ever have such volume, nodes as datacentres will be only slightly worse than lightning-hubs as datacentres.


Ok, for the record:
1. increase the blocksize untill we can't. Chances are good that we can forever, since bitcoins will not be the world's onliest currency.


It's not important if I agree or not. The current state is: Bitcoin is not a payment system. Everybody who thought it is has been cheated. 


Second layers don't exist by now? I was fooled that bitcoin works as a payment system? I don't know how you feel, but I don't like this. 
As I said: I have to accept it or leave, since this is your new consensus and I can't change it or doesn't want to. But please be honest and stopp sucking people in bitcoin by promoting it as a currency / a payment system.

This and you cherrypicking things of my post that I did not even made, is why I don't discuss with you. 
These things have been discussed, several times, several forum, in depth and detail, and either you have seen it and decided it are straws, or you decided to ignore it or that they are not worth to think about because it have been the wrong persons who said it. I don't care.
It just is not true that there are no cons of SegWit like the "FAQ" or your "resources" pretend. They are nothing but advertisement. 


I did not talk about SegWit transactions being bigger. I talked about incentives. So half of your answer misses the topic. The rest:






And note: I am not against SegWit. I'm just against the advertisement.

again unnecessary hate without a reason against someone else. Why is this not moderated away?
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:27:54
this has nothing to do with the agreement

sorry to say this, because I like this funny attitude, but you, my dear Cosmic, would be a much better underground rbtc agent :)
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:21:21
SegWit makes transactions bigger, only in the range of a few byte, and it sets the incentive that it favors bigger transactions. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:35:32
this is no FAQ, this is a Shill. There are many other resources pointing out a more accurate picture of the pros and cons of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:26:32
For example AA who thinks that a node has to have the UTXO set in memory. Or bitusher who thinks that you need to upload blocks to eight peers to validate transactions.
The misunderstandings are not juts on one side, they are heaviliy and intentionally spread on both sides, and you, as only moderating away one side, are unfortunately - and, I think, without knowing it - part of the problem of a degression of the debate to the level of ground school gangs / Donald Trump. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:27:54
I know this sub very well, and "no bigger blocks" has nearly never been the angle to complain about SegWit. I'm sure you know this too - but why do you pretent to not know?

welcome to internet discussions. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:38:55
there is a difference between needing to store a private key / a seed somewhere, somehow, and watching a channel 24/7.
This is no arguments against LN. I just don't understand why you guys have to overplay the advantages of LN and make it some crazy mega super medicine against everything.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:25:42
No. I didn't talked about democracy. I talked about the politics of finding a compromise that's ok for all parties involved in holding bitcoin alive.
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:33:55
Yes, there could be a point in time when the incentive of miners to keep the system working - to not crash Bitcoin - is smaller as the incentive to break the 21m limit. At this point in time the exchanges will have no other choice than destroy bitcoin or raise the limit. I guess sometime in 2035-2040 this could happen. 
Something like this is what Peter probably meant and what a hysteric crowd heaviliy misunderstands ... 
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:46:11




This. If there are no cons, there is no tradeoff. You admit that there are cons, but you don't want to call them so, as it doesn't fit in your marketeer plan. Just say: "There are pros, and there are cons, but I think the pros outweight the cons" and everything's ok. 
But again you did not answer any of the claims I made. If you don't understand them, ok, if you want to ignore it, ok, if you think it is wise to answer them with things ("opt-in") that again have nothing to do with the claims ("opt-in" is the part of SegWit I actually like) I made - ok. Do what you like to do, but don't pretend you do anything other than advertismenet. 




If you had spent a thought on this you would understand it easily. I did not say that SegWit tx are bigger (they are, but insignificantly), I said SegWit incentivices bigger transactions. Reducing utxo == more signatures == more blockspace == bigger tx == less tx / kilobyte. 
This is not that complicated. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:17:53
since when is a poll an evidence? 
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:36:02
No, there are some technical merits, but also some technical disadvantages. Both have been pointed out, ignoring this is politic.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:31:53
depends on your point of view. For an investor, and for someone interested in sound money - yes. For the system to work - no. Sometime in the future it migh even be an obstacle for the system to continue working.

it was discussed, very often, and if you would open your eyes you'd see that there are some reasons against it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:34:04
repeating something doesn't make it true. While I think SegWit is over all a good idea, there are real and serious disadvantages, and these have been expressed here, in the other sub and on medium various times. Saying that there are only political reasons against is ... politic!
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:59:50
Miner don't want this. But if we keep onchain transaction volume low, the point will come when the miners and the ecosystem have to decide if we just throw away security or raise the coin limit. Good news is that we have decades of time to prepare for this moment.

Since when has your assessment of upgrades become a legit reason to kick agreements?
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:44:35
I hoped that you, as you are now paid to "fight misinformation", would be honest enough to learn about pros and cons of upgrades. And there are numerous cons against SegWit, discussed intensively on both subs. 
It is really not my job to educate you about the topic you are paid to educate people, but, yes, hints, not complete and just scratched:
- the discount favors not only UTXO reducing tx but also bigger tx, which is anti-scaling, and it favors transactions that violate your privacy by melting inputs
- an estimation showed that SegWit uses 1.8 MB space for a transaction capacity of 1.5 mb
- the only way to get 4 MB blocks is to build spam transactions. So for every "real capacity" you need to have resources to handle the 2.5 fold capacity due to adversarial conditions
- To not fragment the network SegWit nodes need to priorize SegWit nodes and do something that is essentially some kind of blacklisting of non-segwit-nodes
As I said, this is not complete but just a scratch of what has been actively and visibily discussed. It is disappointing to see you, as a paid expert who should educate people and fight misinformation, become part of the misinformation by ignoring such important discussions.

Does this mean that your exchange has to store the Bitcoin it stores in a lightning-channel by itself? And is this compatible with cold wallets?

@_date: 2016-11-21 12:10:32
ok. 
Please note that I don't argue against LN at all, I just argue against the claim "LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions".
If I got you right in case of a system crash I just have incentives for my counterparty to close the channel. As he could learn about my crash if I notify him to close the channel, I shouldn't, and just wait and hope.
If both parties crash, I guess we'll have to wait untill nlock times out. Than we have the most current transaction or the initial state of the channel?
Sorry. Am no expert :)
Do I need Bitcoin to open a channel? I thought I just need to create an address to receive funds ...

Hei thanks for clearing some things up, and I'm happy to learn by discussing. I for sure aim not to intentionally spread fud about SegWit. In fact I like it, I asked the BU team to implement it, and I've praised it in several articles. 
So, really, if you think I intentionally spread FUD, you should work on your understanding of an unbiased debate. 
I read so much about SegWit, there is so much praising (and not for ungood), but this is a detail I did not know and it changes a lot. I know - and explained - why it is like it is. But this doesn't change that it is. So plz excuse that I mention it. 
If you don't mind, I'll get through your points end defend myself where I can, happy to learn more.


--&gt; this is semantics. "Connecting" means actively searching contacts = outgoing connections. In my tests I had zero outgoing non 0.13.1 connections. If this was bad luck, plz tell me and provide statistics about the typical behavior of the nodes. You said one of your two nodes had one outgoing non 0.13.1 outgoing conn. So it is 15:1?


Discuss this with Peter Todd. He made the claim in the mailing-list, not I. I just quoted him. 


Got it. Maybe I was too "multiculti-flower-power-yeah-yeah-yeah". But you would say that a variety of connections should be welcome? Or do you think this is in general a menace to the network?


Ok. This was not a good formulation and is wrong. I should not have written this. Sorry.


Ok. You did not say how many outgoing connections your nodes have. I had, as I said, no non 0.13.1 outgoing connections. Can you explain how the nodes search for outgoing connections? 


Do we still need to talk about XT? It is the worst that I don't compare your work with a dead implementation?
With BU I need to manually choose thin blocks suppporting peers, which is the way I favour. If BU would have the rule of XT - which definitely would be effective in terms of bandwith - you can be sure I would complain about it. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:58:31
he did not say it is not important. He said it is no central property. This is a very different meaning.

@_date: 2016-11-20 10:56:11
Most funny question of the interview:


The whole idea of Bitcoin is to not trust banks with transaction confirmation but decentrally qualified miners. It seems the whole state of the debate has downgraded into something  that has no longer anything to do with bitcoin.
And another funny quote, Aaron redrumming the good old "as long as your doctor can't make you live forever he's not worth the visit" argument


And here this journalist, worried about trusting miners like satoshi planned, recommends users to trust banks:


@_date: 2016-11-22 16:43:25
And how can you proof that it is the newest transaction? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 13:54:39
great idea to ask this in a sub where everybody thinks that only stupid people oppose segwit
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:18:08


Thank you for telling us how to do our jobs. What qualifies you to proclamate what it truth and what not?


You seem to see what you want to see. Or, more precise: You see what you don't want to see and oversee what you want to see. Many people do. Not seeing how your wife is nice, but everytime seeing how your wife is bad. And so on. 
Look at the statistics. Google news, matches for keywords:
- SegWit vs Bitcoin U.: 18,000 vs 800
- Bitcoin Core vs. Bitcoin Cl.: 3,600 vs 600
- Lightning Network vs. xthin blocks: 1,600 vs 39
Feel free to suggest other metrics / examples. 
I for myself can tell you that I spent much more hours explaing SegWit, Sidechains, Lightning, CLTV and so on than Unl., Cl. and so on. I also spent hours to explain why one camp of this debate refuses to increase the limit (as I invest my time why the other camp wants).
I notice that in both camps the tolerance for a journalist doing so is not very high. The result is that now in both subs some people think I'm a biased journalist and bought by blockstream / Ver.
So maybe you start with validating your own assessment of what Journalists write about instead of complaining. 


Have you proof for it or is this just a wild speculation based on ... your ideas? If you have proof, it can be an issue. But as long as there is proof that there is s significant group of economic and development actors that wants to increase the limit, you need really hard proofs that some shady activities are a conspiracy ...

I'm just the bitcoin news guy, so I'm a bad source for reliable information about regulatory issues. But I can say yes, it's mostly p2p, but no, this is no espace from regulation :( 
[And, btw, if I don't explicity tell, don't take my opinions for the opinion of bitcoin.de. Regarding "THE TOPIC" most people from bitcoin.de are closer to you than to me, but the wonderfull thing on our relation is that they support me no matter what I write]
I don't know if you are aware of the upcoming EU-regulation. If you hold any kind of "credentials" to build transactions (one part of multisig keys e. G.) you will be heavily regulated. There is currently a loophole if you provide an online wallet that reconstructs funds completely from user's seed (and, maybe, if you store they keys like blockchain.info in the browser). But I don't think any exchange will be not regulated and I'm hard to think about an exchange design to escape regulation.
The interesting question is if exchanges can have one part regulated (exchange) and another part not regulated (LN-hub). 
But I guess it will be easier for non-exchanges to be a hub because they can simply stay away from regulation.


Don't really understand. You mean exchanges don't enable the trade with coins but with transactions / receipts?


You mean, if a hub don't know who I am because the IP is not part of the routing? If this is realized it would make many things easier.
What if you exchanges becomes your hub and you don't know it? Will this be more terrible than current blockchain analytics exchanges increasingly are forced to do (Bitcoin.de is not, but will most likely with the upcoming EU regulation)?

Thank you! I think honesty is the thing this debate needs most, even if the maximum we can achieve is that we will not agree and that this technical bikeshedding has been an incredible waste of energy ... 
Unfortunately Lejitz' paper explains why a gap between both part of the communities is something he considers a win (as it blocks every kind of attempt to change Bitcoin) - I respect this position and am thankful for it - but I fear the time will come closer when you immutability-fans will learn that immutability and scarcity alone is not enough to keep the crypto-revolution going forward ...

Isn't this a property of every software without an auto-update?
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:40:47
Cool. Got it, play around. 
Landscapes sounds interesting, but I have to try and play with it ...
Strange that the average number of inputs/outputs is decreasing. I don't think this implies a decrease in the size of tx, since more complicated scripts have become common since then. 
But yes, this is hard to understand. Since the value of one utxo is raising, you should expect the opposite. What do you think is the reason?
Looking at your UTXO charts: it seems that creation / consumption of UTXO for each transaction is more or less balanced. I don't understand why the UTXO-set grows.
Do you have something like a ratio of this two values? This would be very interesting and it would help to determine the growth-rate of the UTXO in relationsship to the transaction volume ... 
@_date: 2016-11-23 08:31:08
I don't know every word on "the list"
@_date: 2016-11-30 08:23:42
Thanx, this is interesting, will research this. 
When I thought about attacks, UTXO seemed always to be a weaknes for me, as it is the minimal state of the system. Also the subsidizing of UTXO consumption is my favorite part of SegWit, even if some libertarians don't like it ...
Can you tell me what happens with my node when the UTXO grows beyond my RAM?
As far as I know it is stored on HD, not RAM (my node uses less RAM than the UTXO size), so I don't think this really is a pressuring issue ... 
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:18:51
wow, this was the most coherent, troll-free explanation of a small blockers perspective. Thanks for that. I learned something (what rarely happens on reddit)
I'll try to answer it and give you my point of view. Maybe this helps to bridge the gap.
There are many things I agree with. An inflation free, well-secured, more or less infinitely scaling bitcoin without becoming centralized / governed is a good goal, and I agree that we will run into trouble if we do all this onchain. I also think that we should do our best to realize this *method* to scale. 
Other than you I however don't think this *method* should be enforced. I think it should grow organically. Maybe transaction volume will offload to altcoins or payment channels, maybe it will result in datacenter-nodes. I don't think this will happen soon, and even if, it will be a big step forward from the current system (since you still hold your priv keys and since mixing coins will still be possible). If the government of datacenter-nodes gets too rigid (demanding KYC for transactions, blocking tx) bitcoin will loose properties the market is well aware of. So the price will crash, people move to altcoins.
While I like your vision forward, I don't share your dystopic fear of the other path. I think the best future would be to reunite both paths: let it grow organically, improve onchain scaling, start payment channels, develop sidechains (if they ever will really work), develop better altcoins, make agreements about sustainable blockspace use, improve privacy, and so on ... I assume the cryptocurrency system as a whole has long become secure against "government regulates Bitcoin nodes"-attacks. Like Satoshi said: The technology to do it is here.
Another thing is the "conspiracy"-part. All what you say makes sense if you assume bad motives from Mike and Gavin. The "communication restriction" here, the "ideological purging" of the development team, the army of pro-core-trolls, the lack of cooperation with other development-teams, the complete resistence against minor compromises ... all makes sense if you think there is an ongoing state-level attack and mike, gavin and so on are the agents of this attack, and "your team" is just defending itself. 
I don't think so. AFAIK Mike did only propose a method to do black/whitelists like they are long done by other companies; he never tried to make them part of the protocoll / the consensus. Also this was a minor part of what he done, and unfortunaly a reason why many things he developed have never become part of bitcoin. And Gavin did compromise with Clazik far enough to make any kind of governance-explosion in nodes impossible. 
If I'm allowed to paint a counter-conspiracy-theory - I'd say that there is an ongoing attempt to purge bitcoin development, to character assasinate people that don't match the ideological preferences, and a large-scale manipulation with social media and a horde of fulltime trolls. I not even assume bad faith. But it makes me incredibly said to see the community splitted, good developers gone, angel investors stonewalled as trolls, early adopters raging on both sides, and everything falling apart in a never-ending quarrel, instead of changing the world.
The prize for Bitcoin development to take the one path you prefer is a horrible dividing, a political desaster, a brain drain, a destruction of the community. It would have been easy to choose a reuining solution, about one or 1,5 years ago, but it was not choosen, and now it's too late. We have to live with a gap, it will not go away.
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:12:13


Really? Think about what happened:
- Gavin proposed a floating limit. Some other dev said it will lead to decentralization, and that a limit - even as big as 100 mb - is needed
- Gavin proposed his first increase. Other devs said: Too big, leads to centralization
- Gavin proposed his second increase, with smaller limits. Other devs said: Too big, leads to centralization
- Then came Scaling, pw proposed SegWit, everybody cheered for SegWit + a small bump, maybe 2-4 mb. This would have had a strong consensus imho and would have laid the debate to rest for at least 3-4 years. Than we got only SegWit.
- Gavin and friends got lower, to 2 mb. Seemed like a fine compromis. But it was rejected.
- small blockers said, big blocks will affect block propagation and create bandwidth spikes that knock out nodes. An alternative team of devs developed a nice solution to improve both - it was rejected.
- miners and devs meet, agreed on segwit + a small increase hf. What happened? Miners did not run alternative clients, devs did not code a hf.
I'm happy when lejitz and other people are honest and I can understand. but it seems understanding is a one way road.
- team bigger blocks said they want no fee market. We have a fee market.
- team bigger blocks said they want blocks not to be full. We have full blocks for ~8 month
- team bigger blocks said we need to increase blocksize with hf to "plan for success". We did not.
I recently had a correspondence with a small blocker. He begged me to understand his position. I understood and we started to discuss his ideas of economics. Ok. Fine. Then I wanted him to understand that I'm upset about communication restrictions in main bitcoin media channels which prevent an open discussion and free market decision of the path forward. He did not understand and applied semantics to say "there is no c.ship"
So, no, I think it's your turn to understand. 
If your message is like that from Lejitz that you will not compromise, on no hf, I can understand and I can accept this. That's what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:27:37
to be fair I'd like to add my response:






@_date: 2016-11-24 11:46:12
Yes. 
Start with some devs who agreed with the miners to release the code for a blocksize-increasing hardfork in exchange for the support of segwit.
Stopp blaming the miners for instisting on an agreement.
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:35:46
it is also important for things like audits of exchanges or self-audits by users. 
And beside this: it is a property of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:00:32
So it is possible to independently verify a LN balance without trusting anybody like you can verify Bitcoin balances?
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:07:13
Hm, exchanges are already centralized hubs / gateways for fiat-btc and already heavily regulated (see irs/coinbase). I'm not really looking forward to see they becoming hubs for payments. This sounds like exactly the nightmare we want to avoid by keeping the conditions for bitcoin to remain decentralized. Or did I get something wrong?
About cold wallets: Yes, if exchanges take funds out of cold wallets into hot wallets it maybe is the same as if taking funds from cold wallets into LN channels. In the end they could store funds "cold" in a LN channel (at least I guess). 
@_date: 2016-11-19 15:31:39
That's ridiculous. There has been an agreement between miner and core that miners will activate segwit after core released a hardfork. Don't know why you blame roger 
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:20:47
I'm no mod there. I moderate another, smaller forum, that is mostly inaffected by this. 


I completely agree. This should be made a code of conduct for both bitcoin subs. 


I don't think so. Imho rbitcoin is much worse. Here you have nearly a dozen of persons whose name is enough to make any argument unnecessary because the name alone make every code / argument wrong apriori
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:44:12
so it's like the damned gavin said that the threshold should be low enough that no single party could veto it?
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:46:21
I'm not the author. Ask &gt; although I'm surprised that you find this noteworthy.
We (the bitcoin community, those voting for bigger blogs) spend so much time and energy to bikeshed about technical problems and about decentralization and a lot of devs invested a lot of energy to solve the problems (bandwith, propagation) thrown on us over and over again to fight an increase.
And now it is simply no issue and has never been? What a waste of energy and words and discussion ... 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:54:15
welcome to bitcoin! 
@_date: 2016-11-20 14:06:19
you're welcome :)
I don't think you have to worry about. In fact, BU takes core and adds some features 6-8 people in Core are vehemently against and has its own process of peer-review. That is all. 
I guess the majority of core contributors has no problem with BU and would simply continue contributing in case of a "regime change". Maybe they would even be contributing more, since BU seems to have a more open approach to development as core (but this could rapidly change if they get in charge).
Also, look at how many people contributed the last three month at core. Maybe 20-30. Deduct employees of blockstream and MIT, and you have maybe 10-15 developers left working for free, and not more than 2 to 4 are radical small blockers.
A non-significant part of those not-employed contributors to bitcoin are already in talks with the BU-team and don't engage in camp-building, but in bitcoin-building.
So, the number is not as dramatic as you think.
@_date: 2016-11-25 10:06:28


I don't argue about this. It's obviously good to not need a consensus change.
I argue about this:


is imho wrong. I highy doubt that a user interface can hide the fundamental changes that each of the options you outlines does to the user experience. 
Beside this: All your three options (LN, TumbleBit, Power Money) are at this stage hypothetical, while the changes in user experience are real.
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:51:49
Ok, sorry for the "you guys". We are all individuals --
I don't think "we" underplay the advantages of LN. It's a great feature, but it sucks that it should replace onchain scaling. That's all. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:58:52
yes, bitcoin should not need the social construct. This is the way the value of money was determined in pre-Bitcoin central banking "consensus" (believing your central banker would not cheat you that much)
Technical Nakamoto-consensus is the only important consensus. Imho it's only rule is that you can't take part in the system if you don't follow consensus. 
Since Nodes can be easily sybilled only miners are important for this consensus. Maybe economically important nodes like from exchanges and online-wallets too ... other nodes like mine are just noise
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:16:12
no problem. But plz don't expect it to be changed today.

Empirical data suggests otherwise. So does theory:
1. If fee pressure builds up, you choose small transactions. Without SegWit this means few utxo consumption and more utxo creation. SegWit changes these incentives which is one of my favorite features of it.
2. If you clean up your inputs, you are usually not in a hurry. So you choose low fees. If there is free space in blocks they got confirmed at some time. If blocks are full, they don't get confirmed. UTXO is not reduced.

WTF --- I witnessed chats between huyang and the 3U devs about several problems and solution with mining with 3U. So please, stopp this ... 
With the same reasons I could clame that Bitfury just pretends to mine with core while using 3U because 3U has better broadcasting properties and it would be completely reckless to use another implementation or centralized gateways.
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:47:46
Ok. My nodes currently eats something like 0.5 GB RAM while the UTXO-set is 1.5 GB. Can we assume that a third RAM of UTXO-set is ok?
If so, my PC with 8 GB RAM should be able to deal with a UTXO of 24 GB, and with an investment of 50$ I could upgrade it to 48 GB. Seems like we are far away from this bottleneck. 
Heck, even my old Laptop with 2 GB RAM should be far below the required RAM for the current blocksize. 
But last time I tried to sync I gave up after ~1 week ... I guess this was because it was too much work for the CPU to compute every signature in the historic blockchain - or because of the RAM that is needed in this process? 
@_date: 2016-11-30 08:29:44
Thanks, very interesting. This is what is needed.
Do you have further data about the behavior of the UTXO set? On your side there is a chart about creation and consumption, very interesting, but I can't see details (do I need to login?)
Is the UTXO growing with the size of the blocks? Is it growing faster when blocks are full (I think this would make sense)? Is there some correlation with the number of transactions? Is there a quote of creation/consumption for each tx on average? These things would be highly interesting ... 
UTXO is somehow paradoxical, because less utxo = more blockspace, and the other way round.

YOu did not see what Gavin saw. Magicians trick people. 


Wright's proof have been fabricated, but they have been great. Beside this did Wright have nothing to do with the debate (except that nullc was obsessed with him)


Now you don't even explain why. You just say what you want to see.

He is prominent and loud and able to write well and has a New York based new employer. It's natural he gets this. 


Yes. Right. He was wrong. People are this all day. Maybe even you?

Maybe "failed" is too much ... I know how to do multisig with Electrum or GreenAddress ... the problem is that you can only do it with other people who use the same wallet ... when multisig would work as it should, exchanges would need just a notary to have nearly 100 percent security.

I don't think so. Most people agree that I do a great job FOR bitcoin in german internet. 
Before this stupid blocksize-war and its trolls toxicated the atmosphere readers explained politely when I was wrong, I changed my text and everybody was happy. The discussion was polite and constructive and nice and helpful untill the idea came out that your are an enemy of Bitcoin if you don't agree to your mindset uniformity. 


The points I admitted I expressed not entirely right I asked my editor to change. But since I don't agree with everything nullc points out and since some people here think it is not ok to quote a public statement of a dev, I have no hope that this will satisfy you. 
You know, I guess arount 5-10 percent of all published articles are fact-safe against experts. But you did not care if the articles pointed out things you like. 
You know, I recently wrote this article
If you liked, you'd find as much reasons to say it is wrong as in the other article. But since this is all pro-segwit, nobody of you complained. Look at all the articles out there about SegWit.
Example, coindesk:


Wrong. Plain wrong. But nobody of you complained. 
And here, again coindesk:


Wrong. Just wrong, as is pointed out so often. Where is your complaint?

Wrong. Why did nobody complain?

While I think SegWit is better than nothing, agree to the fear of the hardfork and don't agree (can't comprehend technically) with the fundamental critique of SegWit, in all fairness you should have noted these quotes that answer your questions:




Maybe this can be fixed in a hardfork (when it is done), but maybe it can also be used as a further argument against a hardfork and make it even more contentious. 
Another (minor, psychological) point:


I think the ViaBTC boss wrote that he fears that an activation of SegWit will further delay the needed hardfork to bigger blocks and result in nothing more than us having this discussion over and over again in one or two years. (while there are other ideas which don't)
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:16:28
Multisig is a great concept, but with the current setup it is unusable. This is the reason even the exchanges can't build multisig-wallets by itself and need bitgo.
If we are lucky multisig will be enabled by decentralized middlemen-solutions like openbazaar. But without middlemen it seems to be unusable. Thus I consider it mostly a failure.

Oh Jonny, you tried for a year to puke a hole in BU, you were always wrong, and now you think you have something and run around demanding attention.
I'm sorry. It is a bad habit to answer persons, not arguments, so: sorry. But everybody who knows your behavior on some other forum knows that it is a waste of time to discuss with you.
Ok. Arguments. Not for you (you will not understand anyway) but for other people:
- if the majority of miners shares the same EB (let's say 70%) the "attack" is at worst an incentive to join the majority. It illustrates the brillant game theoretical mechanism at work in Bitcoin.
- In case the majority shares the same EB, all what happens after this attack is that the attacker loses his block reward. Maybe he has the luck to make another random miner hash in the emptiness for some blocks (maybe). Nobody loses as much as the attacker.
- as was pointed out, the worst case is that for some blocks two chains are mined. This will resolve quickly thanks to AD. As incentives force miners to learn and apply some hash-spit-detection-algorithm (to not waste hashes on a dead chain), this likely will not happen often. But, yes, if, then the worst case is, as you point out, a double spend attack on breadwallet. As breadwallet is not used by exchanges or other big economic entities, this is the most expensive attack of a miner on a private entity. 
**Edit:** What Jonny is right is that there is more research needed in the game theoretic mechanism of Bitcoin U. This quickly escalates in many difficult scenario, and while there is a strong reason to believe that "nakamoto consensus" will still hold true, it should be worth the efforts to research those scenarios. But assuming an attack, ignoring / misunderstanding the responses and running around telling "Bitcoin U. is dead" to a forum that wishes Bitcoin U. was dead is the dead wrong way. 
Let's research, let'd discuss. But stop making this a political game (and yes, Jonny does)

Who's we? r/bitcoin?




Except it doesn't exist right now.




Except that it doesn't exist right now and most users would be crying for joy if they would still be able to have tx confirmed in 10 min. 


No. A minority of wallets is ready right now, LN is not ready (at best in a statet that is a complete desaster for privacy and decentralization).


No. The missing piece is that a couple of core hold the promise they gave the miners in an agreement: release a core version with code for an update. Miners clearly stated that they will not activate segwit untill this is done. 




No, really? Like we could do two years ago with Bitcoin? Amazing.

Circle is, like any other Bitcoin business, including blockstream, a company that has to make profit by taking an input and delivering an output to the market. It's model failed to do so, imho. Usually you would hide this under another round of investment funds. But with this capacity of Bitcoin this has become a no-go for layer-one companies. I guess bitPay will be next to realize this.
If we had no companies like circle or coinbase and so on, just holy core devs, we would never ever get to a point where the FED would even notice Bitcoin. Bitcoin would be software, no money.


This is the whole point. Thank you. If Layer-1 remains small and Layer-2 does not evolve the banks will have a party on the devs.

Actually I wanted to stop discussing here, because I can't change minds and the path is already choosen (and I'm not hostile to this path). But since you looked several times on my comment:
1. 


Yes. More or less. Not just me, a lot of people. And latest fee event proofed it again (plz don't start the discussion if spam attack or not).
Some other people get what they want (no hf increase at all), but are still complainin about not being understood.


Yeah. Nice you say it this way and not "See, you are wrong and I am right".
I don't want to waste our energy with shedding about the details. You go it mostly right, I think, but I don't see why this is no compromise and understanding by team "big blocks" and no compromise and no understanding by team "small blocks."
Just one thing:


I know, the agreement is highly interpretable. Antpool did never signal classic, only f2pool let the miners vote for signalling classic. In the end the pools stayed to their main promise (not running core-incompatible software) while core did not deliver a release with a hardfork. Surely you can discuss the semantics, endlessly, but in the end what counts is if miners think the agreement was honored enough for them to run SegWit. 
This makes the pressure on Roger Ver to "not block SegWit" completely silly. If there should be pressure on the miners to "think about their interpretation of the agreement" or on some devs to "hold what they promised in the agreement". 
3. 


I guess it's too much saying that your selection of this detail means that you are ok with the other wishes?
Why no fee market? What is the incentive? Currently the incentive is a reward with 12,5 bitcoin. If it happens that the price doubles in a period of four years, what may happen for the next 8-12 years, the incentives for miners don't change at all. 
If this formular is broken, we can discuss a fee market. Demanding a fee market now it is just a projection of some future problem into the present and harming adoption (ironically setting the furture incentive on risk).
In the long run we surely need fee income to sustain mining. But I think a strictly set blockspace limit is one of the worst methods to achieve this. Since putting tx in a block means work, there is a natural fee market (don't start with discussing peter's paper, look at 0-tx-blocks), and imho an organic growing number of tx under the conditions of a natural production cost based fee market is the best way to secure and scale miner's income in the future (while a strict limit depends on the assumption that users are willing to pay very very high prices and risks ending with a limited number of users paying a limited amount of fees). 
If you look at charts like production cost / transaction (blockchain.info has one) you see the madness of this economic approach. 
If you further think about it, the biggest menace to miner's future income is not an limit increase, but lightning. I can only sustain mining under crazy conditions (which would equa to a doubling of the price for at least 4-5 reward era -- see above: no fee market needed at all)

I'm not here to discuss this with you (I could, for sure, e. G. that you just handwave away one of my favorite parts of SW, its influence on UTXO). I just wanted to answer your question:


You got an answer, and if you want to discuss it, don't talk to me, talk to people which are against segwit and "block" it. 
The fact alone that we can discuss this makes SegWit *without* a blocksize increasing hardfork contentious. I guess with a hardfork it will be still contentious, but for other reasons. So maybe the only way to get it is to eliminate the capacity aspect (and search for new, real onchain scaling solutions, again)

As far as I know, the smart contract is no problem and could be soon implemented in payment channels ... the problem is to build some kind of routing that doesn't map IP and Bitcoin-address (what would be a complete desaster for privacy). The devs invest a lot of time to build some kind of onion routing, and while I'm sure they will succeed in it, I think they will need some time to do untill we have a LN that is ready for use that is no fund-tunneling between large hubs. If you add the need to build this into wallets and to add it as a payment options for payment providers and websites and so on, the guess of end of 2017 really seems optimistic.

I don't think you should be happy that companies like Circle quit.
- A nice online wallet like circle provides makes Bitcoin more valuable. That's gone.
- Without Circle most US-people go either to LocalBitcoins (risking to be caught by LE) or to Coinbase (IRS ...). 
This event says clearly: there is no point in making Bitcoin usable as a means of payment. Worse: It says you can't use Bitcoin for it. 
And, most horrible, is that neither Lightning nor Sidechain will be ready to fill the lackage of capacity as it exists. In fact, I don't think they will ever, but that's another discussion. The result is that there's the risk that using digital currency means using Bitcoin to settle Dollar.
P.S.: I did not answer your doc, but I hope to soon publish an article about this point of view. I hope you'll like it (imho it will offend both subs, so it maybe will be downvoted)

I don't think companies like Circle have any duty to engage in protocoll development. They give Bitcoin a value by making it buy- and sellable. Both devs and exchanges give Bitcoin a value, both on its own way.

Thanks for staying polite (unfortunately with some debates the climate has degraded to a state we have to be thankfull for being able to talk without insulting, accusing and lying).
General question - do I need to lock funds to receive BTC via LN? And do these funds have to equal the funds I receive? (I thought this was just FUD / an old version of LN).
(1) If my final balance of the channel is less than my initial balance - if I send more than I received - I have no reason to worry. Sure. Either the channels resolves and I win, or the counterparty resolves the channel and the tx is made like it should be. 
(or did I somehow misunderstood you? It's not easy to talk about something that does mostly exist in theory and is damn complicated)
(2) I think you got the problem I talk about. I receive money, my nodes crashes and my backup is only my address. Now I need help from someone else (a server? A LN hub?). And you don't worry about this?
(I'm sure there will be a lot of trustworthy entities to do this, and maybe we can use IPFS or Ithiiiiierium to save tx or you can connect your node to a server, dropbox, harddisk to save it ... but it's no bitcoin transaction -- to hammer down on my point :)

I'm aware of the attacks on nullc, but like ydtm is not entire rbtc, nullc is not entire core. Like some posters on rbtc make the whole forum look bad, nullc's public behavior makes the whole core devs look bad.
Just count the number of people nullc attacks, and the number of people rbtc attacks. You'll be surprised.

Funny thread and unfortunately by itself an example of the problem. It states that the division of the community is a big problem, but does everything to faciliate this division.
It states:


and then segregates parts of the community away as traitor of "the real thing":


So, the danger is to divide the community - but business are willing to sell out privacy and thus the enemy. Good job.
And it goes on


and next sentence it segregates one former member of the community as a traitor "of the real thing" away:


And, worse, it widens this conspiracy into all who do not agree with SegWit


And yeah, now it really starts. It calls the name of all those traitors of "the real bitcoin":


Ok. This post does not just call everybody "on the other side" a traitor to the real bitcoin, but it introduces the category of **Bitcoin politicians** to tag out everybody who is against SegWit. If you are against SegWit, you are by definition are Bitcoin Politician - in fact, it leaves only two choices: pro-core and "Bitcoin Politician" ...

I know how Lightning works. Sorry, no lightbulbs :)
At least I know how the smart contract in it works (channelling is a big sphinx for me and I hope they find a robust onion routing because everything else would be a desaster for privacy)
In fact, I was a big fan of Lightning and am still in some regardsm, since I completely am aware of the dozens of advantages offchain transactions can have over onchain transactions. 
But there is one thing that made me unsure about LN. Up to the point that I get upset when someone tells that "LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions". The backup. 
If I generate an address, write down the private key and receive Bitcoin on this address I simply own them with my key. 
If I RECEIVE money via LIghtning on an address I generated and 
printed out the priv key and then my computer crashes and I loose my LN-transaction - can i recover it without help of the counterparty? If my LN-balance was prior to this transaction 0 Bitcoin - after the crash it will be 0 Bitcoin I think. 
Sure, since the counterparty doesn't know my computer crashed and will loose money if they cheat, they most likely will just finish the transaction (release it at some time on the blockchain). But this is more paypal than bitcoin. Bitcoins are not stored in keys, but in transactions. 
Or is the tx flowing around in the network, in some kind of mempool, and I can just login to lightning and get the latest transaction for my address? Maybe the design of the network can help.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:37:58
That's right, that what I'm talking about.
Number of transaction, block reward and hash rate are independent variables. But together they build the fundamentals of the systems. And one of the conclusions you can draw of them ist: energy consumption vs. number of transactions.
And if this conclusion is not sustainable (like paying 8 dollar for each transaction) you have to think about what varibables could alter in what way. And, to return to my point: the small blocksize limits the possible alteration of one important variable in this formula.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:28:10
Will there be a difference between core- and xt-adresses? As I see it, there is no reason why a transaction / a client could just see, where a transaction comes from. 
There can be some confusions with verifying adress-balances, but I don't know a reason why the clients should have general problems with transactions after a fork
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:23:30
I don't get your problem.
Block reward value and energy consumption are directly dependent (there could be some volatilities, but at the end of the day miners have to pay their energy-bills and with every ressource price and production cost are coupled)
@_date: 2015-08-18 17:34:23
Yes, I think so, too. But it's an very interesting point about the outcome.
* Bitcoins before the fork will remain bitcoins
* Coins mined after the fork with xt will become xt-coins
* Bitcoins after the fork with core will be Corecoins

@_date: 2015-08-20 10:07:48
It makes as much sense as to compare anything. This are two fundamentals of the network and it doesn't matter if they are related or not - they describe together how much energy / money is needed, to process a transaction.
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:00:09
Maybe the best would be your girlfried could use bitcoin and you already have bitcoins. Than you can transfer in seconds for less than a cent.
e. G. e-coins offers a bitcoin debit card. If she has an account, you can just send bitcoin to her account and she can pay with a 0% fee in shops (withdrawl on atm is more expensive, 2,75% or something like this).
Also you can convert bitcoins with zero fees to several gift cards in the us.
Buying bitcoins is on [Bitcoin.de] very cheap for 0.5 percent.
WIthdrawing in the US via coinbase is something like 1 percent I think. Maybe there are there options (bitstamp)
For Europe there is bitwa.la to send bitcoins to an sepa-account. Maybe for the US there is something similar.

@_date: 2015-08-20 11:57:28
No. Secure transactions are the main purpose of mining. If every miner would mine 0tx the network wouldn't work.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:32:03
It's very simple: When the price of a bitcoin is higher, the miner get more Dollar / Euro for maintaining the network. It's not the fault of the software or of the transaction, it's just the reality of the system.
It is the same software, it is the same reward in bitcoin - but since the reward raises in dollar/ Euro the miners can put more energy in the system to mine.
So the energy-consumption of one transaction rises with the price. 
Your analogy is incorrect: resting in the shade of the tree is a sideeffect of the tree's existence. In Bitcoin, the production of new coins is the main cost-factor and the processing of transactions is the main purpose. So you can compare those numbers.

So you mean, you could feed xt with an old blockchain? But than you won't be able to add new blocks bigger than 1MB (set that the bigger chain already processed blocks bigger than 1MB)
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:50:25
I don't say they are in relation or depend on each other. They just build together the system.
Sure there can be offchain-transaction, and if this is the way you prefer - expensive onchain-transactions and inexpensive offchain-transactions - than it is ok. But you could also just use paypal.
I think a transaction systems needs a fair relation between energy consumption and number of transaction it processes to be sustainable. That's everything.

I'm sorry for those inconveniences and will explore what happened. 
I don't know paycenter. If it's some kind of a mastercard there could be a problem with chargebacks, but that's a guess out of the blue. 
The sad thing in german money business is that in some cases neither bank employees nor bitcoin.de are allowed to tell their customers everything they know. That is a major source of customer's frustration.
I know the support-team of bitcoin.de very well, and their policy is definitely not to lie on customers or to close accounts without good reasons. 
Since fidor is a online-bank (directbank) and their pre-paid-card is just a minor product, I don't see paycenter as a direct competitor. So I think the most reasonable explanation is that there have been some kyc/aml problems with paycenter. Maybe the problems just happened on the side of the bank of the recipient -- I don't know.
I will give you an update if I learn more about it.

Allerdings könnte es sein, dass er sich dabei gerade um Kopf und Kragen redet. Ein PR-Agent, der sonst mit dem Verkauf von Varoufakis-Büchern beschäftigt ist, hatte den Griechen jüngst noch gepriesen als "den wahrscheinlich coolsten, charismatischsten und intelligentesten Finanzminister, den es je gab". Wie cool der sich selbst fand, hat er am 16. Juli, zehn Tage nach seinem Rücktritt, enthüllt."*

Yes, that's ok. Problem with blockstream is, that is has soo much influence that it will always be a risk. Even when the risk of some corruption or conflict of interest is &lt;1% it's still a danger, cause blockstream managed to built an atomic bomb. Only a change to other implementation would disarm that bomb.


Sorry, that's bullshit. There are things like rootstock, if you would have listened to the presentations of segwit you'd know that it allows more scripts, and more. Also I don't had a problem to use Ethereum for Smart Contracts. Bitcoins doesn't need to be the one and every solution, and I prefer to have open and decentralized Altcoins than private and centralized sidechains


That was a quote from your post. I prefer bitcoin to be just what it is - digital cash, a p2p payment system. I don't need it to be the core of an internet of money nor do I think this would be good for bitcoins true destination.

I don't understand. Do you think he is wrong in what he says about the sentiment of chinese mining pools / chinese community? 
(If you think he has *technically*  not much of a clue, you lack to realize that the technical discussion ended. **This is politics.** Chinese Miners have influence about bitcoin, they earned it by the rules of the game - they have the hash-power - but they feel, **they can't trust core any longer.** Why? Because Core is not able to deliver this simple compromise to 2 MB. In China compromises are part of the social-political deal. [they should be everywhere but maybe get lost by US-worldpolitics].  A group that is unable to agree on a compromise is a bad leader*. Cores "strategic partnership" with pwc doesn't make it better.)
*please don't repeat the argument that core are no leaders. They build the properties of the main software and with this economic reality.

That's not true, and if it was true it would make no sense.
I talked with someone from blockstream about that issue about 8 month ago and he said to me they don't know by now how to secure sidechains. 
With Liquid they installed a - private - network of some kind of nodes that verify transactions and blocks. It's more like ripple than bitcoin. So yes, the current design takes fees from miners.
If pb1x was right, it would be a flawed concept. There's no significant incentive for miners to mine both sidechains and bitcoin, since there is no block reward and fees have to be lower than in the mainchain. Such a design would result in an incentive of miner's to do a 51% attack on the money of blockstreams customers instead of securing the sidechain. Also I think such an design would transport the income from blockstream to miners and be not welcome.

They are more or less nerd products. 
I love linux, but it's not a successfull "customer product". There is a reason why windows and iOS are more successfull and why neither my girlfriend nor my parents nor any company outside IT will ever use linux. The administration of munich tried, but it was a big failure. 
It's ok if bitcoin is the linux or bittorrent or myspace or diaspora of money. But don't wait for it to go mainstream. The economy will move on to some other cryptocurrency with a community and devs that are not in complete disrespect to the needs of users and the economy. And if investors get this, bitcoin will stop to serve as a storage of wealth and fall back to single digits.
But it's ok. Bitcoin doesn't need users, cryptocurrencies don't need bitcoin to stay at the top forever, this sub will be happy that all those that are not in line with ideology and core leave and mike hearn will be happy that he was right. Everything's ok.

I don't get it. What makes you sure that 2 MB blocks / a hard fork to it has any influence on the decentralization of bitcoin?
I'd agree that 8 or 20 MB could reduce decentralization. But 2 MB will not.
Keeping blocks on 1 MB threatens to reduce Bitcoins usefullness as a store of value since it will hinder everything bitcoins value relies on - it's growing adoption.

If you surf their webseite it are 9 or 10 plus Luke-jr as a consultant. Someone calculated that Blockstreams employees made 60% of all commitments.
Anyway - we follow a roadmap of an employee of blockstream, we implement a new crypto-algorithm made by employees of blockstream, and it will be employees of blockstream who will do the main work to realize the roadmap, while blockstreams president often speaks in the name of core.
At least this should be disconcerting. I try to understand why you try to downplay this. 




This quotes were made at the start of liquid. I asked if anybody knows if it really worked.

Can you illustrate this with quotes that present camp big block in the darkest possible shape?
Oh - sorry - I should reader closer. You already have. Thanks.
(explanations) This version is extremely oversimplicated. It's the old flawed game of thinking Bitcoin to become he world's onliest money and, untill this happens, ignoring what bitcoin actually needs. The real debate is not if Bitcoins scales in the end with LIghtning/Sidechains or with Nodes-as-a-database, but **if we need to increase blocks NOW**, or if we can wait untill some solutions are rolled out **that don't even work in theory** at the moment.
Small blockist think for some strange reason, that we should wait as long as possible to increase the blocksize and, if it happens, put in an artificial limit to the capacity of bitcoin to enforce a fee market (even while they admit that 2 or 4 mb would be possible without risk).
Big Blockists want to increase the blocksize NOW. They started with 20 MB and 8 MB and are now down to 2 MB. They think the network needs to hardfork to increase capacity, and that this better happens early than later. 
Small blockists have some support on Bitcoin developers and - maybe - long term holders. Big Blockist have a support of nearly every company involved in bitcoin, including the miners.
While I think the classic-2mb-now-approach is not sustainable, I think it to be the solution we need now. But Core (=small blockist) doesn't want to do it, for reasons, that are not completely disclosed, but serious enough to risk that the network goes broken in the coming hardfork. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:00:37
Yes, demand is currently nearly 1 MB full blocks.
It's really time. Either SW comes fast, clean and brings enough capacity - or we get classic. This or that, we will have more capacity in a few month.

You can produce many things artificial: cheese (without milk), bitcoins (as litecoins, dogecoins etc.), art, clothes ... the duplicate is always cheaper and sometimes even better (artificial cheese has better properties for cooking, litecoin has more capacity than bitcoin, monero more privacy), but in the end the value remains with the original.

Instead of calling me dumb, you better learn what thinblocks does and about the difference between "bandwith requirement" and "throughput volume". Hint: a bridge that carries 1.000 people with 70 kilogramm might not carry 70 cars with 1.000 kilogramm. 
You'd realize that thinblock's effect is far more than "reduce the bandwidth requirements to operate a node by 50%."  In fact it solves several of the major problems with bigger blocks. To read a core / blockstream developer missing this and trying to play thinblocks down is disappointing and not a good sign for the future scaling by core.

I guess the "correct" answer will be that you should shut up since you don't understand :)
If I understand it correctly, with SW a transaction will not be propagated (by updated nodes) and not be integrated in blocks (by updated miners). 
Don't know what happens if a tx is propagated by non-upgraded nodes, implemented in a block by malicious miners and shared to nodes that miss the witness to proof it.
But the "correct" answer to that my be that I don't have a clue, should shut up and trust the devs.

This is real scaling. It reduces the bandwith-requirements to 10-20 percent and the cpu requirements to 50 percent. 
In combination with libsec256k1 cpu and bandwith should be ok with 10-20 MB blocks. 
Why is this not in core? I want it as fast as possible in my node and I want the miners to run it.
Thank you

Maybe because everybody who is interested already nows: SegWit increases capacity to 1.7/2.0 mb, is more secure as a softfork, fixes malleability, enables special scripts etc.
Some people don't want to know in deep, either cause they trust core without thinking by themself or because they distrust core without thinking.
Some people know all this and think SegWit is the best way to scale.
Other people know all this and think SegWit is fine, but it's not the best scaling solution.
Those people already explain why they think so.

All right, that was what I already did learn. (I even wrote this in the opening post, but reddit ist not that kind of forum where this is read after one day).
So, two possibilities:
1.) 4 MB capacity is too much in regards of bandwidth and SegWit will fail
2.) Monster transactions have been the only reason we can't scale to 4 mb. But as I see it, Gavin eliminated that danger with some lines of codes.
So the real choice at the moment should be: 4 MB Blocks or Segregated Witness. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:13:35
All right. Questionsmark for questionmark.


It's sarcasm and a joke about the sentiment here that only those who write code have anything to say in this debate and that everybody else, even the CEO of one of the biggest bitcoin-companies, should fuck up.


Many. The promote 2 MB blocks and help to built balances against the autarchy of core. Everybody should know and everybody with a sense for policy and economy and an interest in bitcoin should support this.


Free money for free people. Transactions without a middlemen. Worldwide transactions. I'm not interested in bitcoin as a system that can only be used by 0,0000001% of the world's population and not in bitcoin as a system dominated by a small group of developers around a single company. I'm also have a minor interest in a settlement system for sidechains or offchain-transactions.

@_date: 2016-02-07 14:05:11


Naa ... read their website. They validate transactions by several globally distributed nodes of their own.


Ok, I shoud have been more precise: Liquid provided similar advantages than ripple but is less (?) open source and less decentralized. Is that correct?
@_date: 2016-02-03 23:37:12
Yes, I got this. SegWit multiplies the blocksize by storing signatures in an outside paket.  
I don't know exact numbers, but I think the 1.7MB is just for the simpliest transaction with one input. Transactions with 4 or 10 inputs make more I think (but am not sure).
The thing I'm talking about: Some people (Pieter Wuille?) said, with SegWit it's possible to make a 1 mb block carry as much as a 4 mb block, if the transaction have a crazy multi-sig-format (15 from 15 or something).
So, with SegWit and 1 MB blocks the capacity an attacker can use to lets say spam the network or break the Great Firewalll of China is 4 MB. 
But from another dev (I think maaku, sorry, loosing oversight) I heard more than 2 MB is impossible, because the Great Firewall (I also think I heard more than 2 MB is dangerous because it can knock out nodes because of too much bandwith).
Maybe there is something in the structure of SegWit, that helps to not knock out nodes, or to tunnel the Great Firewall ...

A consensus of who? Obviously not of large parts of the community and economy. If it was, we would not been facing a hardfork.


Thank you, but it was not a good, but a rhetorical question. 


The major goal of my post was to get over this sentiment and make clear why Fighting SegWit is **not** an attempt to discredit people but a technical concern.


Spamming the network with 4 MB / block, shut down nodes with weak cpu, shut down nodes with low network capacity. All that things about the validation- and network-capacity of nodes that have long been taken as an obstacle to inceasing the blocksize. These factors are **not** changed by segwit.


It would be great if it didnt come at the cost of worse scaling.


Since when have the easiest and most obvious solutions become the worst solutions? 
You do wordplays: Increasing the blocklimits is at least a temporary solution to scaling. Like a chemotherpy can be a solution against cancer while it doesnt "scale" human live. 
With the blocksize we can over the next years scale to 8 times the volume as today. As SegWit imposes a capacity of 4 MB blocks in 2016, we could **now** scale to 4 MB blocks. 
Nobody knows if there will ever be enough demand for it. And if we need a solution in ten years, we'll find some. e. G. "Stash" (stashcrypto) is similar to lightning / sidechains, but far more advanced and nearly ready to go. 


No, we have. Onchain we can *now* scale to ~4MB (see SegWit) and with some fixes and some enhancements in IT-infrastructure to 8-16 MB in the coming decade. 
It's not clear if we need more capacity. If we need more, bitcoin will be worth much more and used much more (what can be a part of the solution)
Also, there are decentralized offchain solutions like stash (stashcrypto) that work without needing changes in the bitcoin-protocoll, or the ripple-protocoll (that works similar as lightning). Both can, if demand grows twenty-fold, implemented in some kind ... 


Yes. Agree. But we are *now* not at the limit. If we were, SegWit would not be possible. 


All right. Nobody should be harrassed and insulted.
But it is ok to support alternative implementations like **** and to criticize SegWit?

So yes, this is not only about technology, but about politic. Many many people in bitcoin-space think you / core / blockstream don't listen and are not able / willing to do a compromiss. 
If you were, you would just deploy 2MB blocks now. This would end the civil war and make the fork non-contentious. If core was interested in the security of bitcoin and less in in politics, it simply would do this. Listen.

Bitcoin IS the amazing thing, not just a cornerstone for other amazing things. But it seem too many people are tricked in to thinking that bitcoin can't scale and we should never uply the consensus-sensible update-mechanism of a hardfork. 
Abandoning the payment system of bitcoin will be the biggest cause of instability. Why should anybody invest in "magic internet money" that is slower than a bank and more expensive than western union? Bitcoin's worth was made on the premise of usage. 
This is what you don't get: The way we are heading for is not the way of stability but the way of instability. It's not the way of preserving value but of destroying value.

Here's an interesting analysis of chris pacia


There currently is no need to handle large scale transaction volume. So why should this be an argument to not make bitcoin able to handle the current need for transactions? And everybody knows that the capacity will be at limit soon. That's everything.




There are many working solution to issue assets on the blockchain. The reasons they are not widely deployed are 1. the regulatory situation is unclear (the legal position of those assets) and 2. the blockchain doesn't have enough capacity.
Technically they are all ready to work. 


I'm ok with this. My opinion has less weight than that of a developer, that's good. But that is not any kind of counter-arguments to my arguments. 


Yes. That's something I long tell people. There is not THE vision what bitcoin is, and it makes me sick to hear people say "Bitcoin is a settlement network" or "bitcoin is p2p cash" or "bitcoin is not for your morning coffee" or "bitcoin is just for the rich" or "bitcoin is just for micropayments" (said the ceo of 21.co). And so on. Bitcoin is what people use bitcoin for. 
What I meant: Maybe we get that scalability-shit together, be it with the blocksize, be it with lightning. That would be the best, than bitcoin could CONTINUE to be p2p cash. But if we don't get it, Bitcoin will not be doomed, but just stop being p2p cash and become digital gold or a settlement network. If there is enough demand for it, it will survice. That's not what I want Bitcoin to be, but as you said: What I want bitcoin to be is not important.

Nobody is going to jump on a ship that's already overcrowded. Not the whole world, but nobody. Growth has come to an end for now.
Even with unlimited blocks or lightning the world maybe will not completely jump into bitcoin at a sudden. Maybe 8 MB blocks will be enough forever. But we just cut our moderate growth now to be prepared for the whole world.
That's like if facebook said after 1 milllion customers "we are full now, but in two years we will be ready for the whole world". 
No sane businessman would think like this - which maybe is the reason nearly not a single business supports core's roadmap. 
It would be so easy to just support the demand we have now and we will have in half a year and in a year and in two years. But the policy now is to not support this growth because we can support endless growth someday when magical lightning network is finished.

Sure, it's an innovation and there are some slight differences with Ripple. Sure. 
But if you put your bitcoin into liquid, they are no longer censorship resistant. While ripple, not the "ripple-the-company-ripple" but "ripple-the-open-source-protocoll" could be censorship resistant. 
And since ripple and blockstream are under the same jurisdictation ripple's a good canary to see what will happen when men with guns knock on blockstreams door ...

Bitcoin did proof fork-resistancy for more than a year and we see how many discussion we need to just maybe take one fork that has been considered necessary and obvious for years.
If we don't fork, bitcoin proofs that it is the myspace of cryptocurrencies. It proofs that it is no mean of payment and this has been the major reason for investors to give it any worth.
If you are interested in bitcoins value you should welcome the necessary work to scale it.

With SegWit 2MB blocks mean that the network has to be capable of processing a spike / attack of 8 MB / block. Maybe this is too much.
Also 2 MB blocks mean that there is no fee pressure and so the plan to implement SegWit as a softfork could fail.
Just two guesses.

All I said is that: 2mb will be too small in 1-3 years, and than we need bigger blocks. We shouldn't do this with on hf after another.


When did I want to fire the core team? It's a weird spin to claim that criticizing core and promoting other implementations are the same as firing core.
Classic doesn't want to fire core. They just want core to continue their work with a bitcoin with a blocklimit of 2MB. If any core dev can't do this, for whatever reasons, he resigns by himself.

7.) Some core-developers change to classic
8.) some core-developers say: "My solution or nothing" and change the algorithm. That new core/pwc-coin will be one of the top-10-altcoins
9.) Lessons learned: 
- a small group of developers that is in some strange ways affiliated with two companies (blockstream/pwc) can't force bitcoin in an unwished economic change. 
- The Nakamoto consensus works in regard to protect the network from being captured by some decelopers
- Bitcoin is stronger than before. Price finally rises to new hights.

If you think I wrote this list to pull FUD in the air, I maybe can't help you. The goal of this list was to show that there are a critics of SegWit that are not a result of distrust against core (or an attempt to do a coup).
I learned that SegWit terminates the problem with huge transactions validation. Great. 
If someone expains to me why the other points are wrong, I listen and tell that to people that criticize SegWit.
But i don't see it. For example: On another thread maaku told me that SW + 2 MB blocks are currently too much.
So, if I'm not wrong again, with SW we can have max. 2 MB allday capacity, while with increasing the the blocksize we could have 4 MB allday capacity. That's why I think hat it's not a solution to scaling but a trade-off.

Bitcoin Capacity is subsidized by hash rate increase these days. 
The blockchain grows with a daily rate of 110-135 MB. If blocks would appear one each 10 minutes, the average blocksize would be 0.8-0.95. 
Yesterday for example average blocksize was 0.6 MB while the blockchain did grow for 133 MB, which equals a blocksize of 0.92 MB by 1 Block / 10 minutes. So, on peak the increasing hashrate makes 1/3 of the daily capacity.

Two years ago everybody was sure we will fork. One year ago most people in this sub have been sure we will fork. And now this whole sub rages against everybody who wants to do the obvious and fork bitcoin into scalability. 


So, here we are. 20 MB blocks are a bit extreme, but to think they are a death penalty for bitcoin is highly exaggerated. Bitcoin was run for years with a blocklimit far above the assumed capacity and nothing happened. But the "moderation policy" made you ignore such simple reflections.
In the end even Gigabyte blocks should be a possibility. That would lead to bank-like nodes in datacenters, IF bitcoin is super-super-successfull, what is not ideal, but way better than the current system and not much worse than lightning and sidechains.


Yeah! C'mon. If you wanna play tinfoil-conspiracy you should widen your focus and think about one company that mysteriously get around 75 mio funds and employs more than 10 core developers who at a sudden all fight bigger blocks (and thus bitcoin to become big). I don't believe in any conspiracy theory, but since you seem to like them ...

Sure. But everybody agrees that bitcoin was made to make centraly controlled solutions unnecessary. So what's your point?


Agree, that we'll find other solutions. Even if not, bitcoin will not be doomed but exist in some other way (I would prefere bitcoin to be p2p electronic cash, but it's also possible as slow-and-expensive-moving digital gold)


Colored Coins already exist. Or counterpary. Or factom. You don't need sidechains for issuing assets on the blockchain. As long as there is no solution how sidechain-transactions are secured, it seems as a over-complicated but under-secure solution to use sidechains for assets.


Yes, with the result, that 2MB Blocks are possible now. Regarding to the core devs, who wants to deploy SW, even 4 MB Blocks are possible. That we don't have them by now is more a reason of politics than of technology.

Coinbase enables you to buy bitcoins in the US, transact it to your own wallet and enjoy financial freedom. 
Coinbase achieves it to not be shut down by law and causing losses for their customers.
Coinbase has never be hacked and so didn't cause losses for their customers.

Xtreme Thinblocks fixes an old flaw of the network: every node gets and relays every transaction twice - first, when it's propagated, and second, when it's part of a block.
With thinblocks a node gets and relays just the header of a block plus the transaction he does not already have. 
This reduces bandwith requirements significantly and eliminates the upload spikes when a new block is propagated.

Nice Idea, and in theory you're right. In reality there is a thing called 51-%-attack. If a hardfork happens, the classic-miners will immediately be able to destroy the core-chain. Even if they don't - which sane investor will invest in a coin that lives on the goodwill of it's enemies? 
Or ... will there be merged mining for core and classic? That'd be an interesting and really really dangerous scenario. **Edit**: No, merged mining will not be possible. So, your whole scenario won't work. If we have fork, corecoin will most likely be done in hours. Sorry for all who try to doublespend.
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:08:19
Can't resist to answer this. After I started it escalated to a great length.
Maybe I should first say that I tend to think that a hardfork is currently not really doable and has great risks. Unfortunately. This makes all what I say somehow irrelevant. 


good point. But polemic. 
It depends on the demand for Bitcoin transactions. I don't think it is endless - it has grown linearly at a relatively low pace, even when tx were free - and I don't think that any kind of blocksize increase would ever make Bitcoin a money my mother will use to buy bread. Bitcoin has its specific use cases, but buying coffee seems to not be it. 
So, no, I'm not sure if it really happens that letting layer-1 grow will lead to complete centralization. 
There are techniques to make nodes way lighter, build several levels of node-weight and there is technical progress, both in Software development of Bitcoin as in general hardware capabilities. If you take every factor into account (software development, hardware progress, transaction volume) operating a node has become easier since 2013. (in 2013 I needed something like 4-6 days to start it, now I need ~12 hours; in 2013 my computer "feeled" it, today it is like nothing).
So it's not unrealistic to say that, at some time, wild guess, maybe in 10-20 years, 100 MB blocks will keep archival nodes on a acceptable level of decentralization while enabling devices, that are today dependend on SPV / third party nodes (cheap laptops, smart phones) to trustlessly use Bitcoin with pruned / light nodes. (parity of eth3r3um is a nice example that this is possible). 
100 MB blocks are 30 Mio tx / day. I don't think Bitcoin will ever have this level of transaction demand. "The worse money win", im time of gold-silver-coins people used silver to pay, because gold was a store of value. Bitcoin will never be as direct as cash (you need internet / a device), never be as good as "bad money" to tell for your daily financial activies. This is why I think it might be possible to scale layer-1 to a level serving the demand for layer-1 transactions without getting in a centralized dystopia.
Layer-2 will be needed to serve for e. G. micropayments, more complex contracts, real-time-confirmation and so on. 
I understand that this kind of future has no consensus. The consensus is to restrict layer-1 activity. Ok. 
But that you call me a centralist is polemic. Even your most horrible dystopia - that layer-1 becomes so big, that only big datacenters can assess it directly - is way better than paypal. Bitcoin is an open and permissionless network. Everybody with a datacenter can be PayPal, everybody who has his key and his inputs can permissionless spend Bitcoins. Even if you have blocks that big that only really big companies and institutions can host a full archival node, you need only one of them to be an open explorer / propagator that still everybody can use Bitcoin permissionless. That's a big difference.
You can even think of a future in which local communities share a node, in which a full node becomes the standard in all kind of institutions, in which it will be a "feature" of places, like free WiFi is a feature at nearly every public place in scandinavia.
This scenarios are not just "paypal". Especially when you compare them with a scenario of small layer-1 only for power money, where only big companies and institutions can use Bitcoin as layer-1. In the best case (Lightning) normal users use "not full" Bitcoin (can't do cold wallets e. G.), in the worst case (circle, coinbase) they use it like paypal with another currency.

This gets more ridiculous every day. Welcome to the place where obvious lies are upvoted.
The truth: Only GreenAddress, Electrum and ledger support Core (while this is just half-true in the case of electrum). 
Neither multibit nor armory decided a side. Mycelium seems more to be with classic, but didn't make anything official (or did not decide by now) 
While there are several Wallets supporting classic
- coinbase
- blockchain.info
- xapo
- breadwallet
As Slush support classic you can suppose trezor also supports classic.
So, really - "basically all wallet developers"? I'm waiting for your excuse for spreading misinformation.
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:16:19
Mh ... Yes, it's highly questionable that blocksize can scale to visa-level. That doesn't explain why we shouldn't press out as much capacity of the blocksize as is possible, but that's not what we are talking about. 
Sidechains ... I wrote an article about sidechains and had some e-mail-conversion with a technician of blockstream. In the end the concept was everything but persuading to me. Two major and by now unaddressed problems with sidechains:
- you need up to 24 hours to move a coin from the main chain to a sidechain. That makes it nearly unusable.
- there is no solution on the question who does mine / secure a sidechain. The blockstream-technician said to me, they don't know by know how to solve it.
Maybe - I hope - Lightning will solve the capacity-problem forever. But I'm not so sure any more and I think it's highly danerous to set your eggs in a basket that is not made already. So I think we should - we must - expand the blocksize-limit as much as is possible. And that's way more than 1 MB.
About the potential conflict of interest: What if at some time some sidechain-feature pwc wishes is only possible if we change the protocoll? How can you be sure that there won't be ever any trade-off between an advantage for Bitcoin and for Sidechain? How can you be so sure that:
best for sidechain = best for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:21:53

And, worse, they implemented one of the best security standards for bitcoin with the dangerous result that they have never been hacked. And, as a bonus in malignity, they developed several other services and features and persuaded a lot of merchants to accept bitcoin. 
Really - everybody who cares about bitcoin should boycott coinbase. For sure. Bitcoin doesn't need any economic acteur.  We should boycott every exchange and payment-provider. Write Code or STFU

I didn't said you get paid for this. I just said the practice to someone about whose project you write proofread your article is a practice used in corporate publishing and not used in journalism.
In most countries journalists don't let the people they interview read the interview. (in germany e. G. it is a bad practice to do this).
In every country that has a free press that deserves this name journalists never let people involved in a project proofread an article about this project. Nowhere. Maybe in china, maybe in Eritrea. But not in countries with a free press.
As I said it's no problem you did this. Many journalists earn their money by doing corporate publishing while they do real journalism as a matter of heart. But when you do this, if you are paid or not, you stop acting as a journalist. 
And my impression was Bitcoin Magazine was a journalistic medium and you wrote journalistic articles.

Sure they can. But imho this would make them *technically* more an altcoin than classic. 
Also people like Jonas Schnelli and Pieter Wuille have said they don't support this, so the last ressort of the support to core, the developers, would cease.
Edit: Also, the outcome would be the same. A CPU-minable Bitcoin would be in the hand of botnets (Hackers/Governments) and Supercomputers (Governments) from Day 1. Nobody would invest in such an insecure coin.

It's not easy to get the words for what's on my tongue ... 


Yes, absolutely. There are trolls, that dominate discussions (bitcointalk became imho terribly dominated by them when it's about blocksize), there maybe are sockpuppets, and cencorship doesn't help. The only valid metrics I have are the commenting readers of my blog (maybe they are a bit biased), the statements of companies and of miners. e. G. Slush's pool made a voting.


Thank you too. During all the fighting we shouldn't forget that mostly we want the same but prefer different methods.


Now the difficult part begins. 
To be honest - there is some truth inside. My subjective impression is a frustration with the communication, a frustration with no scaling, a frustration with all that trolling, censorship, character assasinations and more. It's not easy to stay objective. 
As we see your impression is the opposite.


Sorry for cherry-picking from your post. You can turn this question around and ask: Have there been really convincing arguments for core to not just do the 2 MB Hardfork and end this civil war? Do we need Segregated Witness so urgent that we risk the break of the system just to have it now and not after a hard fork?
In my view no one else than core can end this conflict. If classic steps back, the dissatisfaction will stay. 


Good to know the differences. It's without doubt important to work on both fronts. (I don't need to say that I think now it's time to simply scale)


So, we risk a split because core just says "we don't want to hardfork in 2016"? That makes me angry. 


Yes. That may be a good thing, but it is a psychological desaster. A large part (I think so) of the community fighted for scaling. And now we get a solution in which scaling is only a side effect. Even if this solution is great - it's humiliating.


No, it's no longer a technical issue. It's - I think - a political failure of core to not do the compromise Bitcoin needs. 
There are a lot more reasons to state that this issue has become about the leadership and the governance of bitcoin. I don't want to go into details or start with examples - everybody knows the situation - I just want to say I welcome it heavily that we have different implementations with different goals. In my view it's a shame that core still has 90% of the nodes.
Sorry for the long post.

Bitcoin will never be able to compete with those minimal-block-lightning-coins we will see when (if) lightning network will ever be ready.
Also Bitcoin will never be able to resist state attacks as well as more anonymous coins like Moonerow


Those who argue for bigger-blocks-now, come hell or high water, have lost all concept of just how revolutionary bitcoin is. 
Why so polemic / toxic? Big Blockers know the revolutinary potential of bitcoin, they just hate to see it reduced to 250k transactions / day and don't understand the reasons. 


However, if the market cap were to grow to a 100 billion dollars ...
will never happen if we restrict transaction volume on 250k tx / day. Since early 2016 the highs of both price as transaction volume stagnate because one of it is artifially limited. 


If the state wants to attack it attacks the exchanges, the payment-providers and maybe indivudal nodes. It will simply ban bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin will survive, but if, two things will happen: 
1. price will crash so hard that we could easily use some other coin with smaller block size. Problem solved. 
2. transaction volume will decrease heavily, so running a node will become easier. Problem solved.

Yes, good answer. 
MultiSig seemed to have failed to reach an audience beside exchanges using bitgo's wallet, because its implementation is simply unusable for most people. Even exchanges prefer to pay a fee to bitgo than building it by itself.
The idea that lightning will reach a mass market after the multisig-failure is horribly failing to touch reality. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 14:55:36


Multisig is a great technology, a great option, something, that makes the difference between fiat and cryptocurrency. But in Bitcoin it is simply not usable. It is usable if both parties use the same wallet, but not wallet-independently. 
Remember what Gavin Andresen wrote in 2012:


Sounds good, right? For years later, what do we have? A multisig-system that is unusable for everyone except bitgo ... darknedmarcets accepted the exit scam because multi-sig is not usable ... It's a failed system, failed because of ignorance for usability. Sorry for the rant. It's just sad to see. 


I have a hard time believing this after seing the failure of multi sig. Maybe - I hope - it will be easier to implement than Multisig itself, because in concept Lightning is wonderfull, but I don't see clear reasons to believe it. 
**edit:** here we have some kind of misunderstanding:


I did not talk about reaching mass market. I talked about assuming Lightning would enable any kind of mass market missed touch with reality.

In the 90th several banks tried to do it. Doing the same like digicash - banks releasing digital cash - but with a blockchain you don't need the banks to prevent double-spending.
If santander is stupid, they use ethereum to transact Euro between their own customers, maybe by adding some code to the token-contract that makes it only readable for people with a santander bank account or people having some secret key of a consortium of banks. This would most probably a failure. 
However, if they use Ethereum in the strongest way - building EIP20 Token - the Santander-Euro will be tradable on exchanges. Must be. The token will also be mixable. Must be. And like banks can't refuse to take cash, Santander will not be able to refuse mixed tokens. They will verify identity for withdrawl, sure. 
If you don't get the difference between token on ethereum and ripple, the I don't know what to tell you. Go long Ripple? :)

one of the main things I got from Scaling Bitcoin was that in Bitcoin you collect more data you need, like transaction history. If you'd just save the blockheaders and prune the transactions the network would not only take weight from the nodes but also be more private. 
Satoshi outlined pruning in the whitepaper. Did he just not think about starting a node or not care? Or was he just wrong?

I ask a fu***ng question and got answers. If you want to see how this plays out with normal people, look at the answers of belcher or Matthew-Davey and my answers. This is how it should be.   
On slack I got an answer with the fee policy. Absurdly I was accused of not understanding anything as I defined the answer and needed to waste more than one hour to explain in little baby steps why tf the blocksize limit is needed to enforce an indivudual node's fee policy.


If you think so ... I don't care. I don't waste my time to discuss economics with you. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:51:03


Why? Do you think decentralization only has ideological value? Do you think the market doesn't value decentralization? Or do I get you completely wrong?


At first, most likely. But it's possible that lacking merchant acceptance, price stability and liquidity will make one of the forks a minor altcoin that is unable to fulfill the usecases the market demands from bitcoin. Which one is hard to say.


That's an illusion. Even if you permanently ban hardforks.


It's funny that you accuse the big-block-side of "manipulative tactics" and link at the same time to a quote that most likely was not by satoshi but part of a manipulative tactic itself. (I read every post of Satoshi, and this mail doesn't seem to match his style)


I guess as long as bitcoin remains a good store of value, provides monetary autonomy and sufficient financial privacy it will survive the leaving of a group of hardliners who consider bitcoin a failed project because it ignores the veto of the tiniest minority and prefer to go back to fiat-slavery instead of having what they consider pure bitcoin ideology. 
This is a "Either my way or the world should blow up" mentality that in the long term does nothing but harm.


What survey did show that the hundreds of people do this? I only know such statements of 2-3 core devs. 


rbtc will only cheers the quit of 2-3 well known core devs. The will cheer loudly if ~ 99 percent of core devs join camp big blocks.


I don't understand why we talk about this. 
If miners bumb to 2mb, core devs can say yes or no and let the market decide about what is the real bitcoin. If the market doesn't comply to core devs, they can ragequit like Mike Hearn, can build an altcoin and say "this is the real bitcoin" or can join the new bitcoin. 
Not joining the market means increasing the chance of a permanent split. If the devs see no fundamental technical problem with slightly bigger blocks like 2 or 4 mb - like most core devs already said - it is heavily unresponsible to do so for reasons like ego ("not my way") or policy ("never fork against a minority").
There is no doubt core devs do a great job at working with bitcoin code. But why do we have to discuss this? Do you think they should be kings over the market? And that we should implement some government that rules the market to be regulated to not kick of core devs?


All our discussion for nothing? A majority of hash power is the ONLY possiblity to impose new rules. They can never do this without support by the market. I thought we agreed about this.


 
Yes, I'm happy to see it and looking forward to its final release / implementation. You'll see me promoting the use of segwit after it is released, for sure.

- this was not my assumption. I over and over said: Yes, the fee policy is a hard relationship, thank you to show. Don't know why I'm constantly attacked for this. (btw only a fee policy higher than the miners creates a relationship, but I think you don't care)
- in slack it was more like: "Hu, blocks are immediately completely filled", which is a absolutely hypothetical controversal economic theorem ... it is absurd that you accuse me here after I repeatedly said "this is a soft relationship".

Hei, can't agree ... 


No. It's not. Or do you know any precedence when Nodes made blocksize increase or prevent an increase of the blocksize by blocking bigger blocks?


No. Miners are the check. Nodes are fine and usefull, they help you to accept payments and they spread blocks and transactions. But don't pump them up ... if you cut off nodes, bitcoin lives on. If you cut off miners, bitcoin dies. If nodes become evil, nothing happens. If miners become evil, bitcoin dies. And this is how it should be. Nodes can be easily sybilled. Miner's can't. This is the whole idea of bitcoin.

As far as I know, the MIT finances Wladimir van der Laan, Jorge Timon and (formerly?) Gavin Andresen. Blockstream funds a lot of core devs and proudly says they do. So I guess it's ok to also fund a team - Roger says he doesn't, btw - that engages in making bitcoin scale better onchain. Instead of complaining I'd rather like to see more cooperation. 
About MIT: There was a very interesting paper about how to zero-knowledge-proof identity on the blockchain, which had some very KYC-stupid scenarios / possibilities and was publicly damaged by an AMA from the developers which was the most idiotic AMA I've ever seen. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 22:18:49

@_date: 2016-10-24 12:28:54
The point is, it is not an attack, it is the outcome of market forces. Calling it an "attack" is socialism.
But, on your question: BU makes the user-handling of market-decisions easier and legitimates the outcome as valid (while current software defines this outcome as an attack)
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:52:26

I don't say this post is completely wrong, but what is described is not how Unlimited fails, but how the market fails. I guess this kind of argumentation was used over and over and over again to cheer for socialism, regulation and statism. 
Maybe he's right, but please be aware that this means that bitcoin needs some kind of anti-monopolism-reguation, like the EU has installed.
If he makes a point, than, that we need a government-like institution to keep rules that protect the network against the centralistic forces of the market. If you have been sick of bitcoin being promoted as pro-market and anti-governmentm, you should cheer this post.
**Edit:** and you should ask yourself, why Proof-of-Work was invented in the first place. Other than nodes, miners can't be sybill'd. And you should ask what happens if TODAY the outlined scenario happens - that the major exchanges, the major pools, the major masternodes and the major payment-providers cooperate to push away the home-user-nodes ... guess what? They break the blocklimit and push out everybody else. They don't do this because they see the risks and have not enough incentives to do ... Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't change this at all. The described attack would be possible TODAY, and Unlimited doesn't add anything to it ...

Cool --- the most rare words in the internet :)


Maybe, maybe not ... we just know if it happens ... my assumptions are based on the assumptions that most nodes are business nodes and don't act ideological, but follow the easiest, less disruptive way ... it's one thing to announce you reject bigger blocks and another thing to do it if it implies trouble and work and risk


We nearly agree. I just don't like your wording since it implies a power structure and an enforcement mechanism that doesn't exist.
But yes, you are right: miners are part of an ecoystem without weapons, a market, and no player in this system can permanently act against the majority without removing himself ... 
There are several scenarios where miners might remove themselves. Reducing the blocksize or blocking certain transactions are one, damaging decentralization by significantly increasing blocksize is another (which is why the nightmarish-scenario of the OP is not much more than fear of the market) ...
But a bumb to 2 mb blocks would imho not result in miners being "fired". More likely the nodes that reject this blocks will be "fired".
Also it's unclear how the removal of miners work. Maybe it's not as easy as you think, "just changing pow". It could also happen that investors and node operators and markets and exchanges just move to another blockchain (which is imho the easier way to do)


You always have. But I got your point: they don't leave you the choice to reject the outcome of the market for a longer time than x blocks.

sure --- the interesting thing with cb / thinbl is that it decoubles bandwith (to some part) from blocksize and to transaction volume (while without blocksize is a fix peak in bandwith) 
-- found this an interesting idea as I thought about bandwith-dos-attacks, which is good to to discuss relationships between transaction volume, blocksize and bandwith ... but unfortunately your fanclub is more interested in smashing this down ... 
most interesting for me was that the (really uncomfortably toxic) discussion on slack revealed that a lot of people lack the capability to differentiate between technological "facts" and economic ideologies (would be interested how you think about this)
**PS** congrats to the release of 13.1. Unfortunately I have to say this over and over in this climate, where a free mindset is more and more considered as an attack: I'm happy to see how SegWit plays out!

@_date: 2016-10-17 15:12:23
Yes, this is the kind of question the community should have discussed instead of technical bike-shedding about how many MB can go through the blockchain.


I guess some people still believe in cheap and instant onchain transactions. The centralized payment providers can't serve all usecases, especially in media there is an unserved demand for cheap instant microtranactions (I'm a journalist, and I think my whole industry was broken by the absence of it).
However, even while Satoshi said that cheap transactions are one reason for Bitcoin, I don't believe this and I think rbtc does not, too. Maybe you should adjust your question.


More or less I agree with this, and I think the tragedy of all this is that rbtc would agree too. If I want to have real monetary autonomy I need to do a major part of my financial transactions with bitcoin. I don't want to change bitcoin in paypal/Visa money and become dependent of banks and intermediaries again to buy a coffee. I want to be able to buy it with bitcoin itself. 
Just speaking for myself, I want Bitcoin to provide the opportunity for migrant workers to use Bitcoin for remittance, for me, as a westerner, to transact privately whenever I want, to serve as a medium of exchange, when other money doesn't work, to serve as a money for blackweb, to be a medium for capital flight if needed, to be a way for the surpressed to receive money if the bank don't allow it, to be money I can save with a password and spend in every country of the world ... so much ... in short:
**Bitcoin should be a money for everybody, usable when the legacy money fails like it does nearly everywhere.**
And now I guess we can transform your question: 
What's the point of Bitcoin as a low volume payment network?
You can't say "Bitcoin is monetary freedom but just 1 MB every 10 minutes". Cutting the transactional supply at ~250k a day can be translated into "would throw that all that away to make bitcoin into another version" of restricted money. It destroys Bitcoin as a free and autonomous monetary instrument for the whole world and makes it a tool for the rich and the criminal.

Don't retarget the goal - we talked about agreements.


Yes, comment, but not agreement / disagreement. All I wanted you to notice the perspecive of this chinese miner to so many things. I wanted you to know. I was not interested if you agree or disagree (like I don't think it is interesting for you if I agree / disagree)


Ok. We simply don't know, have no simulations, no research on this issue. We are running blindly in something whose effects are not testet. If for good or for bad - most probably Lightning will heavily distrub the relationship between fees and miner's income. Raising the onchain fees as high to replace the transaction-fees lightning sucks away will, I guess, damage usability of the system (just a guess).


Do you have any insight about a constitution giving the miner's the role to "only provide security"? It's a technical system, and whatever the agents in it can do, they can do. Requiring some kind of constitional balances kept by social-ethic norms is just one thing: politics. It's even worse than politics, as it is not based on any societal consens or philosophy, but just on the idea of some indidiuals and easily sybillable social media agents.


He, yes, because Roger has more Bitcoins and a way more extrovert personality (at least as I). But if you send bitcoin, the rules for you and roger are the same, right? And if you start hashing, your hashes are worth the same as from viaBTC, right?
Sure there is social power. Everywhere. As a human we never can escape them. But you should not confuse the social powers around bitcoin - which are always based on silent and flexible ethic agreements - with the powerless structure in bitcoin itself.


Exactly. The consensus mechanism has an instrument to change the consensus under specific conditions. Like a constitution sets rules how to change the constitution.

Here in Europe we are still allowed to use cash. What is an "value transfer network independent of governmental regulation" allowed for many centuries.


This attack is silly. The state only has to prohibit the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment and the exchange of Bitcoin for Fiat. This would crash the value and heaviliy reduce the usage of Bitcoin. No need to do any silly attacks on every single node on earth. 


A defense against an attack no state on earth will ever have to go if they seriously want to shut down bitcoin.
And if ... if the state prohibits node operation so node operators have to hide, guess what happens? Few people use bitcoins and blocks are small. Without a blocksize limit.


Ok, let's say the state needs to do this kind of node attack, because for some reason it is not able to succeed with the simple outlaw-attack, and let's assume the network processes big blocks despite its usage is prohibit, for some reasons, and let's assume bitcoin is so heavily used, that blocks are big, despite it has become unusable ... do you know what happpens? People move to another cryptocurrency with smaller blocks. They undo blocksize. End of the story. 
So, to make it short: you describe an attack no state needs if it wants to damage bitcoin amd that would, if conducted, lead to less usage and small blocks and solve itself, and that, even if the blocks would remain big for somee mysterious reason, be easily solved by moving transactions to another cryptocurreny. Am I right?

- people in charge may know that bitcoin is not the real problem, but if the see a cause the won't hesitate to tighten the regulation, cause bitcoin itself must seem unsympathic for the ruling class and it leaves them completely out of charge (banks, paysafecards, paypal, post-offices - there's always someone you can get your hands on. Bitcoin has nobody to ask)
But yes, maybe someone gets the chance to put bitcoin under a bad light.

What did I miss? My node neither increased the blocksize nor did it block bigger blocks.


C'mon. You started a discussion about miners vs. nodes and now you make them the same? To be clear: Miners = mining nodes.


When did we talk about sense and meaninfullness? It's about life and die.


So you agree that without miners the system is dead while without nodes it lives on (but not meaningfull)?


So my node as the only one that matters to decide if the whole network has bigger or smaller blocks? No, it doesn't.
My node is the only one that matters in very paranoid regards to decide if I got a legit payment. And even in this case my node can by sybilled by other nodes. The role of miners is to prevent that kind of Sybill Attacked. This was the reason PoW was used in Bitcoin.


And if those miner again become evil? Bitcoin dies in a loop of changing PoW. While it is completely irrelevant if nodes become evil, evil miners can kill the system.

Maybe. Writing is not science, and it should be clear that this text is an opinion, taking the whole event from some specific perspective, so I enjoy some freedom to exagerate a detail ... 
(btw, you might have noticed another article from me about fungibility and scalability with some very different result ... and I have written several articles with the opposite point-of-view. I guess changing one's mind is the only choice to stay objective in this game)


Handing out shirts with the message "I agree" is fun? Hahaha. If you think so, you have been maybe for a too long time a moderator in this sub.
Maybe it was an "accident".  Or a sign of "bad taste" from a group that calls a "free speach party" a "social fork". Maybe, maybe ... 


Yeah, maybe you had more chance to NACK as here in this sub, but THE BLOCKSIZE itself was no issue. From the website of the workshop:


The website continues:


As I said, I observed a great variety of scalability solutions. Everything was open minded - as long as "blocksize" remained offtopic.
It may be, like said,  "a dumb idea" to hardfork big blocks. But this is what was promised to chinese miners and that is where the problems begin ...

naa, this is mostly unproofen hypothesis, at least if we talk about blocks &lt; 10 MB. It's not a more important factor than the UI of the client vs. quality of SPV-wallets.
But after all it's about a trade off. 
Question is, is a level of decentralization needed with  +5.000 nodes? I like running a node on my own computer, I like being able to do so, but if this level of local "know to be paid" thing means that bitcoin can't fullfil its potential and has to refuse to serve some demand of monetary autonomy, you have to ask if it wasn't better if you had ~1.000 nodes of businesses + SPV wallets and more block capacity.
If I have my keys and enough nodes to get transaction incredients + publish tx, I enjoy exponentially more monetary autonomy than with banks - without a full node. There is a scenario where you have datacenter-nodes but still way more monetary autonomy for the world than today - and more worldwide monetary than with today's bitcoin. 
It's a sad fact that Bitcoin already refused to serve the full demand for monetary autonomy by limiting blockspace to 1 MB.
I hope SegWit + LN will change this.


Depends on the incentives to double spend. Instant (unconfirmed) transactions work fine in most situations (but honestly it's somehow pervert to use bitcoin this way, to waste blockchain-space for a transaction that was accepted before its confirmed)
Aaand ...


There IS not, but there WILL BE. Most probably.
I'm looking enthusiastically forward. There is no doubt LN is suited better for this purporse than onchain transactions. I hope LN will finally enable real micropayment. 
There are several reasons why LN is not bitcoin, why it could damage miner's income, why it could cause transactional centralization and so on. I love my transactions being auditable, e. G.
But I don't want to discuss this here and just say that I'm looking forward for payment channel networks. Even if I am puzzled if they can replace "real" transactions, they definitely have their purpose and will increase capacity.


Yeah, I hope this works as intended.

And I'm worried what happens when people stop investing in any EURO-nominated asset cause it's better to invest in Dollar-Cash instead of an EURO-asset with 10 percent interest.
My bitcoin assets however have stopped worrying me. I hope more people in Euroland will put their savings on the blockchain.

Maybe, if miners accept the idea that witness data should be included for free (with a discount). 
As it is going down to "miners accept discount policy" I think it would have been possible to fix the misbalance by just asking miners to include this policy?
But after all, if SegWit fixes this somehow pervert incentive structure (just look at what the daily payments of cloud miners do with the blockchain), it's good. If it doesn't create a structure where bloating the full archival node blockhain with witnesses become an option. (Maybe I was not completely right calling UTXO-reducing coin selection "sustainable" since they need much (prunable) space on the blockchain)
(After all, did ever anyone calculated the cost of a UTXO-bloading attack - it should be much cheaper and more serious than a 51-attack)

@_date: 2016-10-13 07:40:22


Yes, me too. 
I agree with most of what you said, except this


They did not. They just allowed their miners to choose to mine blocks with a classic version number while running core in the background. But I guess this goes against the intent of the agreement (like making a bigger blocks hardfork offtopic) while consenting to the letter.


Nobody asked you to agree or disagree with it. Nor was I asked or anybody on reddit. It is just a well-explained expression what a chinese miner thinks about the current situation.
What maybe was most important (imho) is his comment about Lightning taking fees from the miners. I think this part is not completely thought through by most people. 


No. Plz stop using those propagandistic terms. It can't be a power grab because bitcoin is a powerless system. If there is a power grab, you assume that there is a righteous king. There is no one. There is just a consensus mechanism, and what they (viabtc) do fits perfectly ino this mechanism.
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:51:57
Ok, last one for today, I have to leave ... 


there have been no blocks bigger than 1 mb. So unless nodes really reject the network to process blocks bigger 1 mb this is nothing but a survey. Maybe you are right, maybe not. 


Yes, if you define dead as state with no return, yes. But unless a miner comes back to a coin it doesn't really live. While it can live without nodes but with miners.


No. We have a lot of points to disagree with, but this is none of it.
You as an ex freelancer should know that there is only a rhetoric difference between a employee and a company providing a service. I'm personally in some twilight zone between both for years. 
So, no, this is no disagreement, it is just wording.


What evidence? Miners play by the rules. As long as miners mine blocks it is not important if nodes are sybilled. This is why we have miners. Any evidence seems like a construction.


How about some devs travelling to hongkong and making promises? How about miners have fear of forking the network in pieces? As we don't know, it think this is an empty question.


Sure. Right. Beauty of networks, beauty of swarms, beauty of marching in a line, beauty of following the majority ... 


Nice to know.


How does your preferred client behave in this regard? Does it give you the option to not follow the longest chain or to choose which chain to follow? And what do you think - how long would a coder need to implement this feature if it is needed?
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:42:18
Yes, it would build its own network Roger's Pool and ViaBTC and ~200 Nodes for some minutes.
Most probably they will switch back soon, since the "big" block cahin would not achieve enought "depth" to be accepted as the mainchain. But if the pools are willing to risk their block-reward, they can try it as long as they want. 
Maybe more users join BU, because they finally learn, that it does not more than giving a choice, and maybe some big pools like f2pool or antpool will join, because the blocksize has become, despite the hongkong agreement, "not an interesting topic." (see coindesk-article).  
Unlimited essentially gives Miners the choice to say: "Hei, we build a bigger block, who wants to join?" I guess, if it happens, first other pools will join, so that the big-block-chain will be the mainchain for unlimited nodes. Than maybe the nodes will follow, or they will not.

who is "we"?


Who is "them"?


What are the features "useful to the general public"? I guess you say decentralizatin. I'd say monetary autonomy for as many people as possible.
Bitcoin has two mechanism to vote about questions like this, that can't be sybilled: PoW (miners) and Bitcoins (Holders). Discussion on social media and nodes are worthless in this regard.


The exchanges, payment processors and miners ARE the community. If they fight the community, they loose the community and their customers.


Hu, like ikea fighting its customers to use smaller tables and winning if customers stop shopping at ikea? And than, after the customers left, making the tables even more smaller?
The truth is: when people leave the network, they join other networks. And than the other networks will gain value, while bitcoin looses value. This is the markets way to say: Stopp it, you are heading the wrong direction.


It's not an "attack", it's the invisible hand of the market.


No, rules don't make bitcoin socialistic. But calling the market's decision an attack might be the best definition of a socialist.
In fact, your comment is so full of sentiment against the market. You don't trust the decisions of the markets, you want to regulate, you want to define a "we" and a desirable state without consulting the market. I don't want to insult you, but it seems you are a socialist without knowing it.


If you observed the Eeth3reum-Hardfork, you might know that this is not true. Exchanges follow investors and miners follow exchanges. You can force developers, you can force miners, but you can't force the markets.


maybe 1.5 mb or somethink like this. We would have a vivid discussion how big blocks should, what the damages of bigger blocks really are, how they can be mitigated and we would most likely have some kind of public measurement of decentralization / conop. Not everybody thinks this is bad.


So, all the advantages of LN - immediate tx, nearly zero fees, more privacy - would be worthless? And if it happened, a decrease of nodes would not worry anybody? Because the markets increased blocksize to 1,5 mb it will accept blocksizes of gigabytes to transport every micropayment-transaction? Again, you don't trust the market to make good decisions without forcing it. You think if you don't regulate it, the market will stupidly follow the wrong direction and ignore all warnings. 


Again: what kind of collective entity do you mean with "we"?

You confuse a survey ("80% of germans don't like online surveillance") with a real, inconveniant action ("Use Tor, use PGP")
btc: as nodes can by sybilled the "majority of nodes on the network" is a completely meaningless term. This is why we have miners.


Me too ... but I don't know why we have to confirm this?


You can't accept transaction under this condition. As long as this state holds on it's dead. Your bitcoins are worthless as nobody can accept them.


I'd rather call the users the customers of miners. But let's agree there is a relationship between miners, nodes, users and exchanges that prevents miners to act on will. It's called the market. This is exactly the idea of Unl1mit3d. 
The whole "attack" outlined by OP is, in your terms, like "employees pressing their employer away", or like (in my terms) "ikea pushing its customers to tables too big for them to sit at so in the end nobody will have ever tables again." The so called "attack" is in fact an idea how a market could fail to prevent a visible self-destruction.


Im somehow perplex. Did you read any news from Deutsche Bahn the last years? In the context of unions and strikes you should know that you can't find a worse example. The events around Deutsche Bahn proof that you can't easily fire your employees if they don't work and that workers can do serious harm to a company.
But if we stay in the picture ... who design the seats in a train? Who decides about the train schedule? Who decides if you are allowed to smoke in the train? If you, as a customer, do not agree, you use some kind of "alt-travel", like flixbus or carsharing, but if you want to travel by train, you have to go with the rules of DB. 


As long as I want to stay on the same chain as exchanges and everybody else in the ecosystem - no. Are you able to decide you only accept blocks &lt;500k? Not really.
However what you say is again exactly the approach of Unl1mit3d: let the nodes decide and announce how big a block they will accept.


Sure it can. without miners you can be doublespended by sybill attacks, you can be cheated by malleable transactions and so on. There is a reason exchanges don't believe their own node but the miners.


Yes, I suspect too. But the incentives are, as Satoshi said, that it's more profitable to not be evil.


maybe, maybe not. This doesn't change the fact they *can* become evil and *can* harm the network and that the network *needs* miners not to be evil, while nodes *can't* do evil and *can't* harm the network and the network *don't* needs nodes to survive.

my last answer was too fast ...
some more points ...
1.) we agree that miners don't act in the nothing. They can't decide at will, but their decisions have to be confirmed by the market; they follow the market. We disagree in the influence of nodes. You seem to reduce the market on nodes, while they are just a part of it, and that part than can most easiliest been played (compared to investors and exchanges and so on). 
And you seem to have a problem to accept than no one beside miners can build bigger blocks.
2.) I think that's all. Have to go. Enjoy your evening
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:38:36
You don't need to get more clear, I know your (highly conspiracious) assumptions about Big Blockers and so on.
It's just that you did not post several arguments against a 2 MB Softfork, like you said you did, but only one that is based on a highly unclear assumption. That's all.
Since you don't seem to be capable (or willing) to understand why "it doesn't fix malleability" is no argument against a 2 mb hardfork that was never meant to fix malleability - like it's argument against coffee that you can't use it as gas, or that a car can't fly, or that a dog can't purr - I don't know what to add.
If you cut out the two "It can't do X" arguments you are left with one single argument against a 2 mb sf, and this argument is based on rough assumptions. That's all. Say Hello to logic.

Mhpf. They still have an agreement and AntPool expects from the counterparty to deliver what they promised. AntPool delivers by now by not running Cl****c and in the future with running SegWit. 
If you or other core devs do not support the agreement you can vote against the hardfork and make it impossible for your team collegues to hold their agreement. 
This would break the agreement, miner's would not run SegWit and would not have the duty to run software that is compliant with Core. 
So, essentually, if you decide to vote against the hardfork you vote against SegWit. You did not agree to anything, you did not sign any agreement or contract, but that's the reality and the outcome of the hongkong meeting. You can blame some core-developers for accepting that agreement in exchange of eliminating a direct Fork from Cl****c, but you can't blame the miner's for doing what they agreed to do.

Nice :)
Another good find is this:
My personal guess is this anoymous poster is satoshi
After all, Hal Finney, Wei Dai and Adam Back have been as close to Bitcoin as anybody can be. In their discussion in 1999 everything was there - PoW-minted money, a public database of all transactions, a limited monetary supply ... 
I never understood how Adam Back could not be completely enthusiastic after learning that Satoshi tried to realize what he discussed ten years before. (while Wei Dai presented a very consistent explanation why he doesn't care about cypherpunk's money any more)

The source of this is the blog of the kopp-verlag. In germany it's well known as a source of esoteric bullshit, conspiracy theory and many other things. Everybody knows that kopp is just a source of entertainment but in no way a serious source of information. As an "alternative" Media, it's a proof, how strong we need well-educated, fact-checking (and paid) journalists.
The linked article is really bad. It also claims that ISIS takes Bitcoin for kidnapping and that you just have to cut the Bitcoin-transactions to cut the money fans of the ISIS send to them.

I'd never finaly believe anybody is satoshi if he did't gave a cryptographical proof I could verify. But I imagine he could have reasons to not want to publicize such a proof of his act and it  puzzles me that four early adopter confirm him to be satoshi.

You should use bitcoin.de
They recently released an awesome trading api
They also partner with fidor. When you trade with your fidor-account your Euro-balance is saved by Deutsche Einlagensicherung (and you get interest on it + can use it as your giro)
Also bitcoin.de is the only legit exchange in germany, so you enjoy more legal safety than with any other options.
Finally they are auditing user's balances every year

"I don't care why anyone is using bitcoin. But if anyone using uncensored upvoting I care"???? WHAT? What are you doing in bitcoin-land? Not caring? 
You basically say that a bitcoin transaction is not as important for you as a reddit-upvote. What do you think about steem?
F**k. I shit on any reddit-up-or-downvote. I don't care, and if I care it's because I am boring and on procrastination. Monetary transactions rule the world. This is what I care about.
You basically say you just don't want censorship in bitcoin because you don't care. If you'd care - if someone sold your little brother drugs for bitcoin or something like this - you would instantly cry for transaction censorship???? Is this right?

That's not true. Bitcoins are not and have never been and will most probably never be protected by "einlagensicherung". Not on bitcoin.de and not on any other exchange or wallet. 
The good news: on bitcoin.de your Euro-funds are protected by the "einlagensicherung" cause they remain on your bank-account.
The good news II: bitcoin.de has been audited by an independent audit-firm that confirmed 1. that the funds declared in bitcoin.de's databases are the same as the funds the users declares, 2. that those funds are available one the blockchain and 3. that bitcoin.de has the private keys to this funds. This process proofed that bitcoin.de posseses the user's funds while it keeped the adresses of those funds secret. See more information:

Sure, the post was not meant to discriminate CSV. It's great to see it in bitcoin. But it illustrates a thing ethereum is good in by design while bitcoin is bad in by design. 
Security? Third Party Interventions? As far as I know CSV-like constructions with Ethereum are more or less riskfree, since there is not that kind of smart contracts complexity as in the DAO, and if you don't put 5% of all Ether in a CSV-like contract, you will have no chance to appeal on THE WHOLE COMMUNITY to intervene.
With the hardfork Ethereum surely took in another direction than bitcoin. Both have their strength and weaknesses. But using CSV to illustrate that Bitcoin is evolving faster / better than ethereum looks like a sign of desperation.
@_date: 2016-07-23 08:51:35
ok, i was a bit drunk and my answer was a bit over-emotional and confused.
But the sense remains the same, the morning after it: You say you don't care why anybody is using bitcoin, but you care of anybodys comment and upvoting when it affects you.
In the end this means that you are commited to censorship when it has an effect for you. 
You realize we are talking in a thread that complains long and angry about the case of another coin that censored ONE transaction after EVERYBODY agreed? And what you say is basically that you want to censor A LOT of comments because YOU don't like them? 
Since you basically say that is is good that we have this thread to talk about etheerium and not the other, well-meaning threads on rbtc - you say that you want monetary transactions unconditionally be uncensored, but you want communicational transactions be censored. Right? 
You get the irony? Something got terrobly lost. Seriously and not as an insult: why are you here? Do you have any commitment for any kind of freedom?
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:02:54
haha, CSV is the worst example when you compare btc with Etheereum. Why? because "Shitcoin" doesn't need any kind of fork to do what CSV does. It can already do it, naturally, and much more, and much more flexible, and much easier. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:34:00
Sure, that's what I say all the time. In turkey the hivemind is full on holy erdogan, in germany the hivemind is full for afd-nazis, in uk the hivemind is for brexit (what is imho something like suizide these days), in libya the hivemind resembled gadaffi by civil war(lords) and so on. Usually the hivemind is very stupid, but democracy is the idea that the stupid hivemind is never as bad as one evil man's mind ... 
And, to go to bitcoin (or ethereum): wise individuals decide which transaction goes through. Ethereum government decides that the dao hackers transaction doesn't go through, PayPal decides that wikileaks should not get money, the Bayerisch LKA says we should block every cannabis' dealers bank account -- 
you get it? you can't be bitcoin-minded and support rbitcoin. Supporting rbitcoin is the same as saying "It's fucklng stupid to let communication be uncensored". If you are for bitcoin, there is no way around that you need to be for rbtc, because bitcoin is the uncensored hiveminds transactions, and rbtc is the uncensored hiveminds speech. You can't separate this. It's either you are for uncensored things or you are for censorship. You can't do this strange dance "I'm really really for uncensored transaction and I love bitcoin but I prefer going to moderated rbitcoin because I don't like the rbtc hivemind." The Bitcoin-hivemind in deepdarkweb is far worse than rbtc. Bitcoin-hivemind in deepdarkweb is about cp and heavy drugs and carders and so on. It's dark. If you don't get along with rbtc's hivemind, because you think the stupidity and aggressiveness is too much, you should be the first to ask for censorship on bitcoin's hivemind, because this is the field where things get really dirty and immorality.
And if you are on a level, where you say, ok, I accept all this mud and scum and waste of humanity and immorality and so on, that you find in bitcoin-hivemind's deepdarkweb, because I understand that human history is a process of freedom and because freedom is never for free, but has it's cost and it's unleasig of human scum, than you will never ever have the idea that rbtc and it's stupid hivemind is a bad idea ...

If you like it more, ok. While there are a lot of things I don't like at the other sub, especially when it comes to some people from core - I had a discussion with thomasZ about this where I told him that the sub is not neutral - the attitude of this sub to the da0, etheerium and classix is beyond pathetic - it is highly manipulative. The other sub may express the stupidity of a angry crowd - this sub represents the intentional manipulation of the crowd. 
Edit: like what you like more. As a journalist imho you should be on the side of the crowd, not the manipulators, but it's ok for political journalists to prefer dictators above zealous crowds (Libya is an example, where a dictator obviously made a better job than the crowdstorm and warlords)

how would you define a failure? I'd happy to learn.
For me at the moment there is no failure, since Ethereum's mainchain does not take damage of the existence of the oldchain. Things are clear, and if the classic-chains gets dangerous, the mainchain's miner have more than enough hashpower to fork it easily to death.

You are sure it had nothing to do with "moderation" and backroom-meetings?


Yes, exactly. That bitcoin is unable to do a hardfork after something like two years of discussion is a really miserable message. 


What risks? The risk that some people don't follow the fork, because they belive it is bad to do it? And again - this has nothing to do with two years of anti-hard-fork "moderation" and "FUD"? Have you ever heard of self-fulfilling prophecies?

@_date: 2016-07-22 10:01:42

If you think rbtc is just about "big block fan fiction" your spend too much time here. rbtc may be often too monothematic and so on, but at least you have a discussion of good news of othercoins and the progress in otherclients. This sub here has an agenda of manipulation and defending it means you support the idea to manipulate the crowd (as my libya-analogy says, there are reasons to do this. But please don't pretent you are not doing it while doing it)

This articles don't mention Bitcoin in the context of the amok. The "Süddeutsche" - the newspaper who was first with the story - stated that the hacker bought a "theatre-gun" in the dark web he made "hot" later and by himself. They found it out because they found chat-protocolls on his computer. Not mention of bitcoin, and as he bought it not on marketplaces, it is possible that he did not pay with bitcoin.
So: There are no marketplaces in the darkweb, where you can buy weapons, and you can't by "hot" weapons on the darkweb.

Hm, they proofed they are able to manage a hard fork. Not everyone who can use cryptocurrency shares the "no-hard-fork"-ideology. I guess at best 20 percent of people (it may correspond with the share of goldbugs in society)
On top of it ethereum's smart contract system allows things like CSV, time-locked multisig, conditioned multisig, lightning and many many contracts without the need that core makes a softfork. For some institutions, like banks, this can be seen as an advantage.
Sure, eth has many disadvantages, and it is absolutely unbelievable that their wallet already needs longer to load than core. But who knows? You express the false security that ethereum violates the ideological foundation of bitcoin and thus must be a shitcoin. In the end it's money that matters, not ideology.
