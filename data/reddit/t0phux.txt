Keep them handy, if you read between the lines they said they are trying to convince GNOME foundation to just allow them to use their name, at the very end they say "And if we can’t come up with a mutually acceptable solution, we’ll be glad to look for another name." which is all that GNOME foundation want.  There doesn't have to be a compromise just because someone says they want something.  That would be like you having a shiny new car and me coming along and saying hey, that's mine now, I can use it whenever I want.  And then you go WHOA, that's MY car and YOU can't have any part of it.  But then I come back with hey, lets meet somewhere in the middle, how about I get it every other weekend.

Unlike some previous commentators, I for one am glad you came out publicly and not only addressed the issue but are attempting to find a resolution to it.  You are correct, it's not right for you to be punished for being too successful.
This is obviously a flaw in the BTC protocol that you should not be held responsible for, but that also puts you in the position to fix it to restore faith in your company and the protocol.
We as a community should be happy this is the direction it's going. 
As for what I would like to see, some kind of open source protocol all pools agree to use that prevents the capability to do a 51% attack, similar to what p2pool's use.  getblocktemplate may or may not be it, that's for you guys to decide.

When shit goes viral, companies usually back down if their in the wrong.  If this was hush hush and it didn't catch any traction, you bet your ass they would be fighting those trademarks.

That's defiantly what they WERE doing.  But they changed their minds due to a large amount of pressure.

It's not a FLAW of humanity, it's a FACT of humanity.  Creating a system that doesn't take into account human nature is bad design, plain and simple... Again, a flaw in the protocol that needs to be fixed.
Not sure why I have to repeat this so many times.

Dude that was written so poorly it sounded scripted.
