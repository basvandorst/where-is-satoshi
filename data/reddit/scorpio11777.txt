Back to 10K by Friday like they always do.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:27:32
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:35:43
So Bitcoin is worth $2.5 mil USD in 2057, glad to see a Chipotle burrito is still $5.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:23:51
This man knows.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:37:51
Will be back to 10K again tomorrow!
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:34:22
Winner!  No doubt.
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:20:29
A slow Friday\~
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:42:02
Where's the roller coaster guy?
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:54:10
@_date: 2019-11-15 00:07:02
Pump it!
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:43:10
Whole damn week without any memes.

@_date: 2019-08-10 01:15:44
The frog who bought at 13.8k would be above water soon.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:21:09
How much did the unicorn cost?
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:23:40

@_date: 2019-08-23 17:57:20
Another weekend 11K incoming.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:15:39
What's the weight of this whale?
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:33:03
11K weekend?
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:13:13
At Orlando universal studio now.  The incredible Hulk coaster is mild compare to bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-08-16 22:19:46
Let's have some weekend magic!
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:42:35
What goes down, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:07:55
How long does this take?
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:25:46
Is this donut or halo?
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:59:20
Q.  "Should I buy more?"
A.  "You say no but your body say let's go\~"
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:17:04
Deuce seven off suit, I'm all in!
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:04:24
I knew it!
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:04:55
Will it drop further in 2023 from $60000?
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:34:36
I'm still waiting for the next $13800 since that day...
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:17:39
Been obliterated!
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:51:59
This is hot!
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:30:26
1 is a lonely number.
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:38:27
No time left for pleasure?
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:12:55
Let's hope for 11K again by this weekend.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:13:07
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:18:27
Should invest in Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:12:45
I predict steady increase starting late Monday whole next week.
@_date: 2019-08-17 07:26:56
We need to say good bye to Vegeta.
@_date: 2019-10-28 22:03:54
A slow Monday...
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:33:30
Why did the format change on our daily discussion?
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:15:10
@_date: 2019-08-26 05:43:50
A wise old man who owned 2 bitcoins once said, "remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:29:13
When are we back to 10k?
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:40:27
Still on track for $15k on 8/15?
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:58:44
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:45:40
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:17:37

@_date: 2019-10-09 21:10:12

@_date: 2019-08-04 05:56:27
The only thing I understand is HODL!
@_date: 2019-10-31 23:52:31
In an alternate universe, we hit $16k today.
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:15:47
Better than betting on Saint Louis Blues to win Stanley cup in Jan 2019.
@_date: 2019-08-30 22:22:57
Future millionaire spotted.
@_date: 2019-10-17 05:07:23

@_date: 2019-08-17 17:05:02
So flat...
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:25:22
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:58:57
Vegeta as shock as you and me.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:31:57
You are one smart person.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:44:17

@_date: 2019-08-25 16:53:59
Let's finish strong next week for August!
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:24:19
I think August gonna be strong after the flat July.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:56:58
I can't believe we are actually hoping to see Vegeta(again).
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:49:57
Is not the Labor day weekend yet.
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:05:02
Nah, that's Jack telling ppl Bitcoin is unsinkable.
@_date: 2019-08-16 03:04:19

@_date: 2019-10-23 21:59:03
Where's Vegeta?
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:11:36
Are we going to clear 13.8k this time?
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:06:17
Almost there!  We are at the 7 yards line!
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:09:11
This needs 8600 upvotes!
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:58:23
I like curvy.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:45:15

@_date: 2019-08-21 22:23:18
Life lesson 101:  BTFD!
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:18:11

@_date: 2019-08-12 20:28:36
Any chance to moon this week?
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:25:25
So is this good or bad for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:36:31

@_date: 2019-12-07 01:39:54
Hardly any meme lately.
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:44:03
Go to Thailand.
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:28:17
This time is for real!  We got a upgraded equipment!
@_date: 2019-09-05 18:26:51
Like a phoenix?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:52:24
Is it a 12 incher?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:48:51
Vegeta, is that you?
@_date: 2019-09-02 06:56:17
How much for three?
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:08:37
Been a very steady ride for over a month now.
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:48:32
I thought today would be an easy 11k...
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:42:43
5 digits again.
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:44:36
Depend on if you want the basic or premium service.
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:59:08
10K no doubt.
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:08:54
At what point do we start panic?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:55:17
Next thing you know  
Shawty got low low low low low low low low
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:34:36

@_date: 2019-09-03 16:48:17
Here we go.
@_date: 2019-09-11 18:32:03
Bitcoin is going to shoot up this Friday.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:24:47
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:30:31
Would you take the red pill or the blue pill?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:54:10
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:46:06
Buying signal.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:37:59
Just setting us up for a couple days of +$1000 this weekend.
