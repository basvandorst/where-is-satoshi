To further illustrate the point, google "bitcoin to usd."  
As I write this, 1BTC ~ $438. Much higher than it was even a week ago - hell, even a couple days ago.

When you say "learn the system," what would you recommend that people learn, more specifically? And where could we learn it?

It's really great. Spreading the word and spreading cash! I don't have any bits in my Changetip right now or I'd tip you.

Not only is it great for Changetip, but it's also great for Bitcoin. Yesterday's tipping extravaganza initiated by seemed to have the desired effect of attracting a lot of new redditors to Bitcoin.
I'm not by any means savvy in economics, so maybe this is completely unrelated, but according to Google, BTC has grown 3.060% so far today.

I'm really excited for Bitcoin because of Changetip. One of the big selling points of Bitcoin is how quick and convenient it is to send money - particularly small amounts. Changetip has greatly helped that selling point.
Last night I was graciously given $2.34 in Bitcoin, and with Bitcoin's rise today, it's up to $2.41. So that's neat.

You, me, and hundreds or thousands of others! I think it's great.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound rude, but...that's hilarious.
