I think that's quite likely, yes.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:21:07
Indeed, thanks to them :)

I think the only way is to restart Statoshi/statsd/Graphite. My node was synced in 4 hours, days before I actually fired up Statoshi with Grafana, so the syncing bandwidth is excluded from the cumulative bandwidth graph.
@_date: 2015-05-12 11:42:46
Most nodes that stay up 24/7 run on unmetered connections. The connection to my node is capped at 3500GB/mo, so the bandwidth is not a problem at this stage.
What you are proposing could still be useful, especially for residential connections with a limited upload quota.

created the client fork that gathers the data and outputs it to StatsD :) The graphing backend is written by  There are many alternatives to Grafana, but few are as good looking as Grafana.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:23:58
I had some trouble getting the data into Grafana initially. Turned out the Graphite URL had to be set to 0.0.0.0:80 instead of localhost or 127.0.0.1

Nokia has nothing to do with Microsoft. Microsoft acquired Nokia's mobile division and Nokia continued on with their own product portfolio, mainly networking products and services. Nokia's set to release 6-7 Android phones this year, though.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:13:03
Yeah, I see why you are confused, even the Microsoft produced phones were labelled Nokia in the beginning. The deal they made was slightly complicated, with all the brand licenses and so forth.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:29:59
Nokia has never produced Android phones. The closest thing to an Android phone was the Nokia N9 with its MeeGo platform, a Linux-based OS. They partnered with Microsoft in 2011, and in 2013 the mobile division was sold to Microsoft. After that, Nokia has had nothing to do with phones, until very recently when they licensed the Nokia brand name to HMD Global. If there are "Nokia" phones running on Android in Turkey, then they are knockoffs from China. The Nokia X series was produced by Microsoft, not Nokia.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:08:55
How could you possibly have tried their UI when there isn't a single Nokia Android phone on the market yet? Besides, there's no "Nokia Android" department, the development of the phones is licensed to HMD Global, and Foxconn will manufacture the devices.

It's just a graphing "glitch". No drop in reality. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:00:46
As been said, it's got to do with the pruning. My RPi runs a pruned node, and it shows as Unknown (0).
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:35:03
Full nodes don't get anything in exchange, but it makes me feel I'm doing something good. The cost of having the laptop on 24/7 is negligible, a few €s a month.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:45:22
Nope, not anymore. I used to mine with an Antminer S5, but the energy bill went through the roof.
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:54:40
It's vnStat: 
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:59:48
No need for that, it's an unlimited 100/20 Mbps connection.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:43:52
The node is running Core 0.11.2 on a 100/20 Mbps connection. Last time I checked there were about 85-90 active connections.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:53:44
Thank you ;)
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:24:34
There will be a -maxuploadtarget parameter in Core 0.12:
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:58:30
About 90 connections last time I checked. 8 of those are outbound, the rest is inbound, assisting the network.
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:56:52
You are right. Well, then the January TX total is 935 GB ;)
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:48:31
5 Mbps is more than enough. You might want to cap the upload rate if you feel it's getting saturated. I only averaged 5 Mbps+ on a few days, usually the daily average is somewhere around 3-4 Mbps.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:33:44
It's a 100/20 Mbps fiber connection. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:41:38
The graph is actually the hourly averages for the last day :)
But you're still right, the highest daily average I have seen was roughly 5 Mbps.

I'm running the GUI, but since I never look at it I could probably run the deamon just as well. I mostly SSH into the computer if I need to look at the data.
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:11:45
2 Mbit/s average over a month adds up to somewhere around 648 GB. So no, he didn't mean megabytes.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:39:03
It's my old Asus U35JC laptop that I rarely use otherwise. 100/20 Mbps connection.

I consider myself lucky to live in a country where there are no caps on bandwidth, not even on mobile data. The computer will handle larger blocks just fine, libsecp256k1 improves validation performance significantly.
