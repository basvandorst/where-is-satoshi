If I were HODLing a coin and wanted to see its value increase, I would reply very differently. Maybe these negative types are all holding other coins and want to determine new BTC investors. I am all in on cryptocurrencies, but my friends are now unsure, and if they posted here and not me, it would have been the end of their BTC investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:28:59
I never complained?  Why are some people so jumpy here?  Miss out getting coin cheap?  Ahahahaha

Can you suggest one that allows Canadian money to BTC?

She is in Vancouver 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:19:39
This is all fine, but for an ordinary person easing into Bitcoin none of this helps. I guess this is why mass adoption is a ways off. I suspect his low deposit plus the ATM trying to maximize profits via low miner fees resulted in a long confirmation.  Too bad as it has turned him off from wanting to deposit more. I wonder how many others are falling into this camp?  This friend is part of a group of friends all considering getting into Bitcoin, and now they are all hesitant. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:12:42
It was a question?
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:07:53
I think the general consensus is that bitcoin is not really for purchasing etc. There are better coins for that.  Not sure why you are so mad at the world.  Bitcoin is not yours so move over and get used to it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:31:57
Frankly it is so hard to put more than a couple hundred bucks that she has said forget it. She does not care any more. Makes me wonder how many others are in the same boat and if many, what is the impact on the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:30:48
She tried but they limited her to $250 she said.  In order to get more she has to apparently spend more and then they may raise her limit. Why do they care how much she spends. It is her credit card.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:23:30
I guess that is an option if she wants to pay 30-40% more. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:36:11
So it would appear that ALL the ATMs in Vancouver are not allowing your to buy Bitcoins.  Localbitcoin is a bust as is paxful.  I think Bitcoin and the crypto space has a massive on ramp issue as my friend cannot find away to buy $5k worth.  Sure she can buy $250 on Coinbase but that is as good as she can get.  She has tried to verify with a few exchanges for weeks now and even that road is dead.  
This onramp from Fiat must be a MAJOR bottleneck for Crypto in general.  
Anyone else have a suggestion?
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:34:30

@_date: 2018-01-17 01:27:11
She tried 8 BTC ATMs from 4 different companies all down or out of BTC. She said she tried localbitcoins and no sellers.  She is incredibly frustrated as she has been waiting for the dip and did not foresee this issue.  She said she signed up for other sites where you can buy via credit card but they limit you to $250 or similar.  Why is this so hard?
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:48:24
The only Bitcoin variant on that list worth looking into IMO is BitcoinZ. They have something special going over there.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:11
How big of a dip do you think. I hope it dips below $10k and allow more to get in before it goes to untouchable prices for most.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:30:08
It is going to meander naturally but not go down in any meaningful way as naturally the price vibrates up and down every second  but the moving average over even just a few days is going to be a strong up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:01:59
I thought the same thing, but as I read the many comments from millions of newbies I realize the environment is changing and this I am not sure we will see a dip less a little ebb and flow. I thought it might drop to $7k, but I am doing it till even drop $1000 any time soon.  Who knows as this is uncharted territory. That said the overall graph of value is very exponential looking.

The best part is, banks by their very design are forced to exploit and take advantage of others which will only get worse as the system squeezes them.  The squeezing will only make more stories like this which will drive people to look for alternatives as banks just will not be safe place anymore.

That I agree.  I live in an area that weed is it just not a big deal.

I will add that I am seeing the bigger risk being Fiat and not Bitcoin per se.  I agree with most of the OPs views, however much of it can also be applied to the out of control Fiat space.  I watch "The Money GPS" YouTube channel regularly as he covers the reality of the Fiat space and it makes the Bitcoin drama and scams look like chump change. When I read his community page today (below) I see the makings of the US Dollar heading towards major issues.  It is why I am bullish for Bitcoin's future as what is the alternative to USD if it collapses? Yuan? Yen? Pound? Rupee? Other Fiat? Clearly the answer is none of these, so then what?   Cannot be gold for day to day transactions so then what?  People got to eat, companies need to transact etc.  Bitcoin and crypto is the only real viable offering and hence we may all get pushed into it whether we want to or not.

The latest post from the above community section states:

I am simply here to present the fact that clearly something is broken in the markets and the Fed is trying to cover it up.  . [

I have never watched his stuff but if you and others feel it is solid I would spend some time to review.  I was more pointing out that these as the top 2 really has to be scaring some away. In fact if you search bitcoin on YouTube and filter to the past hour or day you get video after video of polar views. One video will say there is a buy signal and the next will say there is a sell signal. So much divergence looking at the same data.  I am considering feeding into a stat tools and seeing if there is a pattern that matches the reality of what actually happens.

I really have come to believe that the next big boom of Bitcoin will not be due to those who believe in the financial freedom it offers, or those who are just want to get rich quick, but rather those rushing to the only viable option post the US dollar’s hyper inflation that is inbound.
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:42:03
What?  There are plenty of ways to loose. Ask all the peeps who bought in December 2017 and then had to pay taxes in 2018. Ouch. Many got burned bad there. You can also loose if you fiat of choice hyper inflates and the crypto of choice ends up not going anywhere. Lots of ways to loose here.  More ways to loose than gain.

I am not a fiat financial system expert, but no one is as the core of the Fiat system is centralized and thus what is really happening is invisible. The house of cards might keep on going for years to come or crash completely tomorrow.  It is hard to say.  Same goes with Bitcoin too.  What I do know is that if the top 0.1% keep sucking money from the rest of us and inequality continues to grow, change will come.

I am sure the pound has gone up and down over those 300 years but the trend has been down overall.  No disputing that.  The trend for Bitcoin has been up over the past 10 while also going up and down.  I would put my money on the upward trending currency.

The reality of Bitcoin is in many ways similar to the reality of global warming.  Will there be a big hurricane this fall that does even more damage than we have seen in the past? Maybe, however maybe this year will be a quiet one.  No one knows where bad weather will strike exactly as there is no model that can predict like this. None. Models can only see long term trends.  Will there be a big hurricane worse than anything we have ever seen at “some point”....most definitely as the data plots this trend and unless something drastic changes, this is likely a future reality.  Same with Bitcoin.  All the people forecasting big gains in this year or month are taking out of the ass as they cannot possibly know.  That said, the trend of Bitcoin over the past decade is clearly up and unless something drastic changes, the foreseeable future looks positive but it could also all end tomorrow due to an unforeseen event (death hack) or equally have an even bigger bull run due to an unforeseen event (US dollar crash).  The reality is, if not Bitcoin, then what as it is clear Fiat is no longer future proof.

What are you taking about?  You are drinking the banking narrative here.  Inflation does not benefit you or your family and friends.  It benefits the banks. The British Pound which is the original fiat currency has lost 99.8% of its original value.  Come on. That is ridiculous and unnecessary. Crypto holders know to hold is to gain but not really.  You only gain against fiat and the gain is a sign of fiat inflation.  Crypto is very new and once it stabilizes (and it will) it will become the global standard.  Hard to see from this vantage point but people like you made the same claims when the pound was first introduced and again when credit cards were introduced.  When you or your family get screwed by the current financial system, you too will be seeking alternatives. If this was not true, then why is Bitcoin worth anything?  Something is driving the price despite the banking system desperately trying to kill it.  
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:12:19
I never said put everything in Bitcoin?  You are utterly spewing the banking narrative.  It is ok.  History will reveal who is a fool and who is looking at the data and the facts.

It is not a very formal list but I have been looking into who owns every website I go to and flagging ones I no longer trust.  Pretty much everything, including Github. If it is centralized, it is biased and likely not in your interest.  I will consider documenting and sharing but really, the bigger skill is to teach people to question their media source. Look into them as you might discover something that really does not sit well with you.  Sadly, most really for not care and want some “trusted” authority the news.

Of course. I am looking at the data and the trend is clear. Bitcoin has lost more than 80% of its value and then continued on at least 4-5 times over the last 10 years.  It is expected for a new coin that has yet to see mass adoption.  The real thing you need to be thinking about is fiat inflation as all fiats end you hyper inflation as the system is designed this way.  It is one of the reasons why Bitcoin was invented.

Sure they are. They do not allow porn to be purchased with it. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:14:57
Exactly.  This chart makes sense as it helps sniff out exponential patterns.
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:22:42
Exactly. We need to not trust people, we need to verify with a secure trusted blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:23:27
Why?  Please explain as it is legit data and a good indicator of a possible repeating pattern.

Why you wearing a tin foil hat?  Fearful of the truth?
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:13:18
You are delusional. Why would we see different votes unless you have multiple Reddit accounts and used them to downvote, then, only you would see as Reddit is smart than that.

This is not for you as you seem to be a very short term thinker, but for those looking for the truth and not the lie they have been fed, this video yesterday really underscores the reality. I am by no means saying put all your money into crypto, but you are going to want to get your savings/investments away from the US Dollar or suffer the consequences as ALL fiats collapse into hyper inflation.  ALL  
Precious metals, real estate, crypto etc are going to weather the storm coming much better than holding on to Fiat.

Just admit you have been programmed to think the way you do by those who control your money. You are their pawn. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:34:11
Just to see how many times you will reply with nonsense :-)
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:15:20
Yet it helps sniff out exponential patterns.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:19:16
What post got downvoted?  Are you ok?
@_date: 2018-12-03 06:26:28
 So your bank is awesome and in no part exploiting you and others?  
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:20:04
It is called a exponential graph and is intended to be that way. You can find many with the log scale but it is hard to see the pattern as it simply looks like it is going straight up when it has been going up and down and the way up.  
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:02:41
You are missing the point. Surely you too have seen the bank in your pocket? Or are you just loving your bank? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:19:15
That is what I think many do not realize about Bitcoin. It is not really about money, it is about a decentralized, open source financial system as we all know, power corrupts, and therefore the centralized financial system is always going to be filled with corruption, exploitative and disingenuous practices.   
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:52:25
Looks like someone’s  emotional brain is running the show with the name calling. Childish at best and my post is not even negative votes so what are you taking about?  How are you so devoid of facts even when there are right in front of your face.  
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:13:21
You made the ridiculous comment about putting life savings into bitcoin. Who puts their life savings into anything. I am neither a HODLer nor a Lambo bro.  I am a miner who supports coins that are focused on decentralization. You might want to look into it and why it matters to even you.  
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:08:36
You did not read properly. I said I know there are plans to bring my transaction fees down, but I hardly transfer so it will make it actually more per transaction.  Obviously you have a plan. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:49:06
Looks like despite current price action, Bitcoin continues to gain momentum with the lightening network.  This is a strong leading indicator of where things are going.  Do you own homework and educate yourself as crypto is likely to go mass adoption at some point just like Virtual and Augmented Reality.  Give it time. If you think not, you are just not paying attention to the data.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:46:21
PayPal like VISA sure are helping others see that Bitcoin=freedom. Thank you greedy, conservative corps. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:54:08
It cost higher thank normal a year ago due to a number of tech and attack reasons that have been addressed. This said, if you feel your bank has your best interests at heart and costs you nothing, why change. Oh right, fiat funds wars and douchebag governments.  This is not about savings. This is about your freedom but that is cool. You clearly will be a late adopter.

BTW...get back to work. I am distracting you from your mission.
