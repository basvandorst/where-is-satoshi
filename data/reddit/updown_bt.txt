You can set a transaction fee in any wallet. Bigger fee — faster transaction processing. Typical fee for small amounts now is 0.0002 BTC. Your transaction was sent with zero fee, that's why we're waiting for it so long.

Yep. As well as the didn't inform us about IPs that was used in hacking activities.

It's just a bad coincidence. We're startup that using vps from libertyvps and unfortunately we don't have a machine-like memory to remember any IPs that was probably used in any case with any scam, to avoid getting it with newly ordered VPS.

Yes, but we're still not reached our goal of 15 BTC profits to make a donation (
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:51:55
Liberty changed rates, but didn't forgot to inform anyone that they can pay less now )
Anyway we're going to the other hosting provider.

The only strange thing that I can find in this story that Tom, article author, didn't try to contact us and ask us few questions through Reddit/BitcoinTalk/email, especially after his article about unfair bitcoin journalists.
Now we're waiting for an article about our connection to Satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:23:48
Our good will first and foremost! Quote history will be available soon, and payout statistics are easy to verify.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:19:33
We think that now is the best time of your life. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:28:25
Why? 
Our currency and commodity rates are from open sources.
Never heard of it. 
Yep, we're not script kiddies )

We can not confirm nor deny that we're russians, serbian, mongolian or californian. There are some very international person or team or group of animals behind the UpDown. Don't trust everything you can find. 
Our official answer is there: 
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:42:44
We're just waiting for your transaction to come.

Transactions processing is close to be instant. Probably you just didn't set miner's fee, so your transactions have lowest priority in the network. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:57:17
From the same date we've got first server for UpDown, 25th of march.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:09:55
You already got it. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:08:27
You didn't set proper fee, so transactions was processed damn slow. Now you can check wallet for your 0.1 )

We're have same meaning about Mt.Gox, this is awful story for Bitcoin, but there are no foundation role in this case. 
And we're not storing coins — payouts are instant. We have a very little amount at the time on our wallets. No big risks for investors. Everything made very clear — you can monitor all our wallets on blockchain, transactions history is available on the website.
