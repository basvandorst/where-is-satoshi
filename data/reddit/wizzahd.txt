Almost. It mines for the website owner. 
Reddit for example would give this code and then I guess give visitors an option: do you want to see ads? Or do you want to mine btc for us while you're on the site?
All of this is mentioned in the article..

If you visit the site you will see that any business can sign up and create a campaign. I don't like the idea of sporting a Starbucks tee either, but there are other companies that I wouldn't mind supporting (especially if they're going to pay me). 
If you're still against it, guess what: you're not the target market for this service.

yeah lots of people don't realize that this isn't "free." my water bill is included in my HOA payment, but my HOA's water bill last month was ~$1500. that's for 20 units in the building, plus a common laundry room and a hose. even though as a tenant/owner you don't *see* that cost directly, you still pay it indirectly because your community won't have funds to invest in projects or reserves.

Great sources of life advice, both ��
Not that it’s really relevant but if you have a shit HOA, it’s because nobody wanted to get involved except shit people. Just like government, if you prefer to sit back and “not be hassled and let other people deal with it,” then the ones who will assume control are needle-dicked, authority-craving sociopaths. Nothing will be done unless you get involved and work hard to make it­ not shit. 
For me, I was sort of nominated HOA president because I was the only one who gave a shit about things in my building. It’s been educational for sure. Fortunately my residents are all super chill, but dealing with the neighboring businesses, street trash, and local government has been less chill. Money is always a concern, especially in old buildings. I’ve done a lot of work to make our HOA distinctively unlike the horror stories I’ve heard about them.
TLDR: the reason your HOA is shit is because you don’t care. Get involved and make i️­t­ better. Also pay your goddamn dues.

Our HOA dues have gone up 15 bucks over the last seven years. We switched from installed meters I think five years back? I wasn’t living here then. But it­ didn’t change the dues. 
One advantage to the HOA for including utilities is that homes that don’t pay their dues are subject to having those utilities cut off. I­t­ probably sounds shitty, but the fact is that you purchased in a place with an HOA and you signed up to pay the monthly out. Normally there’s very little recourse to recover those dues from non payers, so being able to stop utility services is a great incentive.
(For context, in my situation I’ve got two delinquent units. One is $3k behind and the other 11k. On HOA dues of $225/mo. I️’m not talking about shutting someone off for missing a payment, this is years of refusal to pay.)

It’s not free, didn’t you read my comment? I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.
