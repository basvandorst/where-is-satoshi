A lot of you will already have seen the video I posted a few weeks ago about how I ignored all of these rules and paid a heavy price, [posting again for relevance]( - I hope it serves as a cautionary tale

ahh man, THIS IS WHY I MADE THAT VIDEO. Feeling a little satisfied not to be the only one, but I'm sorry this happened to you too. Keep hodling. I'm lucky that I switched straight back to bitcoin and am about to break even on the money I lost (instead of having ~30k profit right now) and start to get excited about gains again. We'll get there. You've already done far better than most with the gains you have :) The mistake will haunt you but we're doing fine.

good luck :)

My apologies, I just saw it as a tip (in a thread about someone giving btc away, I felt it harmless to give some btc away) but I didn't see the sidebar rule. Won't happen again!

my pleasure!

(and yes, all of the things you could possibly yell at me are already things I know or since learned. I know. I KNOW.)
Hope the next me out there gets something out of this.

Well, look, if your whole lives are invested in this thing, why aren't there more idiots like me around?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:56:52
it was indeed. I wanted to get something positive out of the situation by sharing.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:16:51
well I'm glad I can help facilitate your profit :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:02:20
wowzer. Thanks for sharing, that's rough.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:46:15
How did you know?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:43:30
You're right, I agree with you completely. I've spent all day reading 'you're so fucking dumb' comments on my YouTube video so a lot of that sank in. (Who'd have thought the internet could be judgmental?)
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:58:05
sure thing. An important thing that never connected with me was that, when y'all are saying 'let's go to the moon!!', it's mainly a hobby/interest you're excited about. If it dips again, people don't fall apart. Nobody has their whole life in this (or at least nobody should).
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:27:20
I'm doing that now; apart from anything else it gives me a reason to find optimism in the dip instead of just watching my value diminish
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:01:56
HAHA I DON'T KNOW

I have Bitpay, do I just post an image of the basic QR or post the bitcoin address here?
