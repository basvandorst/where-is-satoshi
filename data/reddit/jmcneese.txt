no, of course not.  i was just surprised, since most people are busy vomiting or drinking themselves into a stupor or jumping out of skyscraper windows when they lose huge chunks of money.  i would hope that if i lost a 70k investment i'd be as calm as this guy.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:32:39
the level of his/her physical calmness?  sure. but his/her online communication about it is quite calm.

@_date: 2013-11-05 14:29:49
fair enough.  sorry for your loss, man.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:51:52
i thought the same thing too.  the whole thing sounds a bit staged.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:15:55
you seem awfully calm about it.

20 years ago is the best time to plant a tree.  the second best time is now.
