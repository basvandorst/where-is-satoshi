Sorry guys. I can't post the convo in full or even in partial.  Below is about 10%.  This guy is a fucking nut.
As far as feedback goes. Let me explain.
I am a zero tolerance trade with very strict terms.
I care about detering scammers
I care about Banks
I care about procedure 
I care about my customers feelings.
Pretty much in that order.
I throw away 100,s of quality trades that do not meet my terms and conditions monthly. This obviously pisses some off as they are so close or don't understand a traders risks and think they are shopping at Kmart.
Traders like camrylopez and Ausbitcoins although are quite strict in their terms are more lenient with requirements, they are also more patient with their customers so when they get a irate they remain more calm and accommodating.
I on the other had nearly always call a fuckhead a fuckhead when pushed.  However during a trade I always explain in detail what is needed that some don't agree with.
As far as this fuck stain goes, I do have his funds and as he didn't complete the trade within terms I offer return in 30 days, all the way through that he has winged and threatened and winged and threatened and cancelled the trade on his own means. (No idea why)
So now it is outside LBC and the 30 day rule is squashed by himself and as he intends to cause harm to me I have instructed him that I will return when one of his threats presents (simple as getting a call from the police or his lawyer)
Between bow and then, this dude is a fool and he knows exactly what to do. I block every attempt he makes to contact me as it is utter B.S. to the top level.
I have no interest in this rant as I'm sure it is posted everywhere else.  I'm sure my customers and I don't give a fuck.
My feedback is based on being strict, not being a thief.
Enjoy your feed

RavenLocks: You are asking be to provide something that is impossible to produce. I just got off the phone with CBA and they confirmed they cannot issue a reprint. I've already been to my Branch where my account is held and they cannot help either. And if you think I'm just going to sit back and watch my father die I am sorry to tell you but I will as a qualified accountant will also be contacting the ATO to ensure greenglobal are complying with tax laws. I will also contact one of the professional accounting bodies to recommend they perform an audit of your accounts.
April 24, 2017, 4:36 p.m.
greenglobal : I've had this happen dozens of times. 80% come back with a reprint.
15% wait their time as they know they fucked up
5% have a ongoing rant thinking standard terms written in plain English doesn't apply to them. 
It is assumed that you are NOT the one that paid the deposit and have a 3rd person that won't give you access to the receipt.

RavenLocks: THE BANK CANNOT DO A REPRINT AND WILL NOT SIT HERE AND BE QUIET WHIKE YOU EARN INTETEST ON MY MONEY. THAT IS ILLEGAL!
April 24, 2017, 4:19 p.m.
RavenLocks: The bank cannot provide a reprint of the ATM transaction. IT CANNOT PROVIDE A REPRINT OF THE SMART ATM's RECEIPTS SO U R ILLEGALLY HOLDING MY MONEY. THAT IS A SCAM IMO.

RavenLocks: Are you deaf? Or illiterate?? I will say this one more time for you and I will give you 5 minutes to transfer $350 from your bank account to my bank account or release it from escrow as btc at the agreed rate of the trade.

April 24, 2017, 4:11 p.m.
greenglobal : I'm happy to return it. Just provide proof of payment (the atm receipt) and I'll be right on it.
April 24, 2017, 4:08 p.m.
greenglobal : Also. Why ask me. You should be contacting the bank and asking for reprint
April 24, 2017, 4:08 p.m.
RavenLocks: What do you need if even the bank can't provide this information?? Are you still going to say no refunds?? That is against the Law!! So please either refund my money or release it from escrow.
April 24, 2017, 4:04 p.m.
RavenLocks: can you please refund the money to my bank account? I will give you the details:
Now, I will be raising a support ticket to have my $350 returned in full as you have no right to hold my funds for 30 days (just because they are your trade terms it does not mean that Australian Consumer Law does not protect the individual (myself).
It is against the law to withhold my money from its rightful owner and I will also contact the financial ombudsman to advise that you are illegally holding onto $350 of my cash which was deposited at approx 14:35 $350 to cba smart ATM in Chullora for bitcoins. And finally, will contact the police to get them to retrieve the mobey

This matter is closed for 30 days. Unless you produce the receipt.
April 24, 2017, 3:51 p.m.

April 24, 2017, 3:51 p.m.
greenglobal : Read my terms
April 24, 2017, 3:50 p.m.

April 24, 2017, 3:46 p.m.
RavenLocks: Please can you release my btc or just transfer $350 back to my cba account.
This money is to buy medical supplies for my father who has months to live. The medicines he needs were supposed to be bought using this btc. Basically I cannot wait until 30 days have pass d as I don't know whether my father will still be alive without the medication. 
Please can you make an exception? I will give u all of my details like photo id, residential address, anything. I just have to get the btc converted today. 
My only other option is to contact support but I don't want to tarnish ur name. Please now that you know why I need the coins can you please release from escrow as a one off fir me? Or pls tfr $350 back to my cba account because the teller said he can see it in the account.
