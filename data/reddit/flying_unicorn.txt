I stopped watching Bill Maher about 8 years ago, when I was in college I used to think I agreed with him and he "got it".  Then after that I realized how full of shit he was and how wrong I was...

I dunno this headline sounds far fetched.  I mean I wouldn't put it past the TSA, but at the same time I just can't imagine it happening.

hmm, I was looking at capital one too...  I have a credit union i emailed them and they responded back that they don't have iban/swift numbers and the exchanges i've checked out require them for wire transfers.  time to start looking around.

Yeah, I'm in the US and interested in trading with USD.  I was looking at campbx just now because they are US based, but i guess they're out of the running for the time being.
What do you like about bitstamp and coinmkt?

How do you do international wire transfers with credit unions that don't have iban/swift codes?  It's the problem I'm having with Alliant Credit Union right now.

So apparently my bank doesn't have a swift/iban number which means i'm opining up another bank account.  Any recommendations for a US based bank?  Thanks for all your info.
