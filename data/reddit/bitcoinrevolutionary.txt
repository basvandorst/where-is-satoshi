If you control the funding and legal aspects of Bitcoin, you can have a natural monopoly on the whole thing. They can gradually build clout until its too late for anybody to challenge. 
The Bitcoin protocol is sound right now but it can be changed if everybody accepts a new release standardized by this foundation which can be done through a fraudelent legitimacy. 
I am challenging the authority it wants to have in regards to official code releases. Whoever controls those, controls Bitcoin. 
If this Foundation partners up with government, we are in for some bad news.

Fuck standarization. Fuck central authority. 
Let the people decide on the their own without your authority!

That has little relevance to Bitcoin as a whole if all other Bitcoin protocol releases lose their clout compared to a supposed "authority".
They can take over Bitcoin by controlling the message and "official" code releases.

Under its reign and authority. It wants to create the standard Bitcoin rests upon. Do you trust your money under their control and "official" releases?

Yes, Gavin, we feel left out when you talk to the CIA about Bitcoin in utter secrecy.

IIRC, he had sent a detailed report outside of the presentation. It seems I might of imagined that. I guess I am false until I find the comment.

The method of releasing code is not decentalized. The Bitcoin Foundation wants to create "standards". That means a monopoly on how Bitcoin works.

The Bitcoin Foundation wants to set the standard on the Bitcoin protocol. It wants to dictate its evolution. It wants to be the employer of all Bitcoin development.

Bitcoin's value solely rests on it being decentralized and not being controlled by a central authority like The Bitcoin Foundation.

Right now we can decentralize, if we're quick. If everybody just accepts The Bitcoin Foundation as the single control over Bitcoin, we're in for bad news in the future. It will become harder to decentralize. 
Tor isn't money. Bitcoin is much more powerful.

They will be controlling the code alright with Gavin running the show, coding the protocol and pushing changes upon people. 
This is a nightmare waiting to happen.

He never disclosed his report. We don't know what exactly was shared. 
The video was only an interview afterwards.
