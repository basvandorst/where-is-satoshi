Congratulations on being a prick?

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:21
Right when I was trying to buy a game
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:41:21
bitcoin.com is a scam
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:56:58
Same here
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:55:57
It's fine, but more or less there will be little/no issues
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:30:08
You ok?
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:18:05
So im probably good? all of my bitcoin was bought anonymously
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:17:26
Old addresses work forever
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:42
10/10 bait
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:03:36
Nice troll
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:30:20
Check out electrum
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:54:06
A search function does exist
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:20
Yeah soon you'll be able to buy a million bch for one btc because bch is a shitty pump and dump
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:06:40
ATM or localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:37
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:52:16
Ok thanks for the info, do you think a transaction Id would help? It's 6 numbers
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:41:32
what if I buy through purse themselves? Im assuming its faster and no risk of scam
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:53:57
Shitty troll account
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:47:49
I don't know what that is. someone else put a transaction number that looked like this one so I figured this one would work
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:29:14
Just sell Bitcoin on there for whatever card type, such as Amazon
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:52:06
You can't do any of that on Amazon. Also how is something gonna be traced that was bought with cash?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:35:48
please learn what purse.io is before saying that
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:01:50
Amazon cards is how I paid. BTW just finished a trade with them and they are legit
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:36:29
Yes let's take advice from someone who can't spell dumbass
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:57:42
Ok, I would check out coinbase.com you can buy Bitcoin on there with a credit card and then store it on there, or transfer it to a more secure wallet such as greenaddress or electrum
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:16:50
I buy at an ATM due to lack of id. I send it directly to the wallet I use, greenaddress
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:45:15
You use the card before you confirm the payment, the best part about selling is you get better value because you underpay them in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:43:56
Where do I get this? I'm using green address btw
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:21:08
Read the sidebar
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:02:58
LOL, that doesn't even make sense 35k for your computer to not get shut down?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:53:41
Yep I've been waiting 4 hours for a payment from someone
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:17:48
Because it's a digitalmint brand atm
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:06:11
I've been waiting on a transfer from one wallet to another for 12 hours, it doesn't show up in either wallet just wait
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:33:18
Electrum and greenaddress
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:53:48
Are you over 18? Also bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:55:55
It isn't illegal, but it's hard to buy Bitcoin under 18. Use greenaddress
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:15:51
Just send it. Mbtc is an easier way to measure small amounts of btc
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:42
I use green address, it's lightweight and is more secure than coinbase and blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:00:29
Well when I was trying to buy Bitcoin, everyone wanted id. It took me forever to get my hands on Bitcoin without id
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:43:14
 this is what I'm trying to buy, and there's an option to buy directly from purse for a 5 percent discount
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:38
How would I pay? I'm receiving money
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:45:11
Amd cards are better for mining
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:47:56
I don't know why I don't have it, I did a week ago
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:35:11
No I want to buy an s340 elite through purse.io with Bitcoin. There is a way to buy through them directly
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:50:25
Thanks, I'll just pay the extra to buy on newegg
