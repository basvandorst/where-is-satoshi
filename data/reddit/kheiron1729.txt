Problem is that modeling is self-correcting process. At first you draw an absolute simple line to explain your findings. Then you evolve from there. Stock market has been studied over years and years by hundreds of mathematicians. The rules are well-established and if you are quant, the game is in the speed.
Bitcoin is a new system. Rules are evolving and modeling bitcoin is very hard. The graph that OP posted is as good an analysis that can get. These sort of patterns are exactly what you should seek out.

Good call

I agree with everything you said. Except not with numbers. I don't think a fall down 5k or such is healthy and I don't think that's happening either. Those were early adoption days and people weren't sure about bitcoin at all. If you got in that early, kudos to you. I was skeptical myself (also didn't have spare cash to invest). Adoption rates have since shot up by magnitudes. There is no way we are in the same stage anymore. Bitcoin's volatility will decrease as will its price hike. I think the price ride should be smoother. The real challenges will be the consequences of this adoptions (possibly government intervention and such).

But it is an asset. An asset that is readily available to you wherever, whenever you want.

What about giving your kid an automatic allowance on steam for 100 Satoshi a week or so? Or possibly allowing him 1000 Satoshi per month with 100 Satoshi on steam as upper limit. Use cases exist. And there are a fuck ton of them. What we are missing that solid use-case that makes fiat look like a joke. More importantly though, we still in adoption phase.

Just curious. When did you first invest in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:03:06
I recently lost a lot of money as well on a failed business. So I know the feeling.
I mined a tiny bit of bitcoin in 2013 (it got lost). I have been watching news since. This always happens. Up and down and up and down. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes unlucky. You never know. But things have changed a lot. Bitcoin could have *actually* failed back in 2013 after silk route incident. Everyone thought nobody will use it now. Not even the drug lords. But it survived. And I still can't figure out how?
I don't think Bitcoin will die like that. Honestly, I still don't know what's so great about it. But there is for sure something there. It keeps getting back up. I think it's the idea.

Woah, what? This is truly a horrible answer.

Actually I'm working on an app that allows you to send bitcoins to your friends as long as they don't spend it all in one go (plus you see where the money goes). It could be an interesting way to introduce your friends to bitcoin. I'm almost, almost done. Anyone interested, DM me.

Hey! I build LApps. My app has been featured on a few magazines, but they were in prototype stages then. Since then they have gotten more stable. But now they look bland. I love your designs and maybe I can interest you in a collaboration. Let's connect. I promise it's worth hearing it out.

Oh. My. God.
How the heck did I not know of this thing!? My jaw is dropped. This is big!

Can you name one?

THIS IS SPARTA

Useful, but not very. Distributed algorithms talk extensively about client/service architecture. This is P2P.

This is good advice. But it's missing the most important thing:
Learn Networking and Protocols!!!
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:47:21
Alright, now you've awaken the monster inside of me. :)
I misconstrued your definition of distributed algorithms and didn't look very much into the link you posted above. Sorry, but dealing with distributed computing day-in day-out has that effect on one ;)
This is not distributed computing.
The inter-process communication here is through a set of well defined set of networking protocols. In the classic case, you are looking at a much broader spectrum. In fact, bitcoin even narrows it down further by restricting itself to P2P network protocols (for the most part).
Distributed computing is mostly used for running clusters of machines in tandem. It is used to run production servers for Facebook for instance. Or run computation on big dataset. In case of bitcoin, the bulk of the work is done by transmitting messages across the network. That is NOT distributed computing. It's simply networking.
Hope that clears it up.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:53:23
I still don't think distributed computing is a core component here. But to each his own.
BTW I don't suggest reading Andreas book. I suggest the developer guide and the wiki pages. The developer guide is brilliant in my opinion.

I can see you know your theory really well. But in practice things are a little different. You seem like a smart person. Try looking into DNS protocols. Unicast, multicast. TLS/SSL protocols. And I mean the actual protocols. No more. Just these would be a good primer and enhance your understanding of bitcoin more than anything you searched before. And if it doesn't, you'd have proven me wrong.
