To steal bitcoins, you must acquire a private key. Hence, one does not simply steal bitcoins... You must first obtain a users private key which then enables you to validly transfer the bitcoins to another wallet. I completely agree that bitcoins can be stolen, but the theft vector is not a bit of code representing bitcoin(s) but rather said key. I feel this is an important characteristic.

You're allowed to get mad and/or worry, but the scam bit is a knee-jerk reaction. There are many happy Coinbase users with a few posting in this very thread. The company is obviously young and growing so issues are inevitable. What about this particular issue or set of issues leads us to believe they have suddenly begun defrauding their customers?

There is no such thing as a bad or tainted coin. It is simply information in a public ledger. Any additional connotations are your own.
@_date: 2013-02-12 00:36:14
What are you intentions?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:58:02
As I said, I completely agree, but there is a distinction.  CashMoney can be stolen in any number of ways besides some password malware whereas bitcoins can only be transferred/stolen by using the correct private key to transmit the transaction to the public ledger. Maybe the distinction is muted, but it's still a unique characteristic and a trait native to a digital currency.

@_date: 2013-04-13 15:48:20
So, it's a scam because your transaction was flagged as high risk during an incredible volatile time and they've said they will refund your money? I've seen many similar threads by people unhappy with this process, but have yet to see an instance where Coinbase has not issued either the purchased bitcoins or a full refund. 
Why don't you take all your evidence of a scam and go talk to the police or a lawyer? I'm sure they'd tell you to read the [Coinbase User Agreement]( and to come back if you don't receive a refund. Currently, you are spreading FUD just because you're nervous about participating in a bleeding edge financial market.

Not worth it. That Java client is horribly inefficient and the site only allows you to makes transfers in excess of 0.01 bitcoin. You're better off trying to run a mining app from a flash drive, but even then it would hardly be worth it unless the machine has lots of cores or a capable video card.

I've purchased Bitcoin from Coinbase with nary a problem. The market is extremely volatile and while it's unfortunate your transaction has been labeled high risk you're just experiencing the same issues as others and have presented no evidence of a scam.
