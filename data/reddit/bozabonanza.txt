Well now they said they will only accept 0.005265 BTC, as apprently I was too late to make the payment????
They expect us to have 6 confirmations for payment within 15mins!!!!
This is impossible as the bitcoin network takes 10mins per block/confirmation!
I asked for a full refund, and will make sure to spread the word about the dishonesty of this company to everyone I know!
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:33:42
They are a bunch of thieves!!!!!
They only refunded me 0.00411200 BTC out of the 0.00601500 I sent them!
I'm sooooo pissed off right now!

And to save hassle for someone else... Anyone know of a reputable company that would actually provide proper service for a prepaid virtual CC where I can do deposits in ETH? Cheers! :)

Thanks Korea! :)

They contradicted themselves too:
Email 1:
Since the payment was not made within allowed 15 minutes and / or was underpaid, the system requested confirmation of the operator. 
Please pay attention! You are not allowed to pay additional amount for this invoice.
Initial invoice amount was 0.006015 BTC, you have paid 0.005265 BTC. 
We can credit underpayment or return to your BTC address. 
If you agree with crediting, please confirm this.
For return, please specify your BTC address. 
Please note that the return may take up to 3 business days. The Bitcoin payment gateway fee will be applied for both crediting and refund transactions.
Told them I made the full payment, and showed them the blocktrail URL. Then they sent me this:
You have paid after 15 minutes, this is why Blockchain released the currency rate and your amount changed.
We can accept only 0.005265 BTC.
WTF is going on!!!!

So true! They advertise 0% fees on Bitcoin deposit, yet they are trying to tell me that I did not deposit the right amount!
Here is the adress for proof:

People are getting arrested for not checking IDs when selling bitcoin in the US atm... He would have to have serious and solid proofs that this is not laundered money... ;)

ROFL I read the same!!! ;)

‘Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, which is slow and inefficient.’
So much fails in that article....
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:41:31
Good one ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:49:54
Why is the USA so backward towards crypto? :(
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:56:15
Do not use ADVCASH. They are known scammers.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:55:30
But will they be cheaper? Or just at that auction day's average price?
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:04:31
Didn't take them long to find them... :D
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:37:00
Well done! I guess he wants to stay anonymous if he is in the US... Unless he wants to get arrested that is... :(
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:07:27
We'll never know I guess... ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:10:31
I guess my question was more like what the starting price would be?
And the $200k deposit to play is pretty eliminatory for 99% of us... :(
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:27:59
Why wouldn't they? They need any kind of money they can get their hands on...
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:52:23
I guess it's for the best if they shut down? No?
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:54:00
Now that's a comment worth upping ! ROFL ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:08:49
Now we all have NO reasons at all to go and pay them a visit... "wink wink" ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:30:37
Coinbase is only one exchange platform, not the only exchange that exists...
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:25:46
17M coins X 12000 = Mucho money ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:54:01
Which is really unfortunate but necessary until we have more ways to spend crypto on/offline...
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:07:20
Ups and downs are the name of the game... ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:57:13
If you are a shopkeeper start accepting it today! ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:13:03
I think most of the popular exchanges combined have more than 50 million users...
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:19:50
They could have buried it for now... Then dug it up in a few months and made lots of cash :P
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:38:26
BTW are you French? ;)
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:37:52
Sorry to hear that. It sucks when you get conned by an online "business". I had the same happen with ADVCASH but I was lucky to get around 1/2 of my BTC back from them....
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:40:46
Electrum is starting to be one of the top wallets nowadays :D
