Probably. 
Good news for everyone else, i guarantee I sold at a low point.  Expect it to rebound.

Good.  I just vented.  Now I am deleting this post.

I was in the hospital all of last Dec and the first half of Jan.  When it ht 18k, I said that was my selling point.  But didn't have the ability to sell it then.

Also, I held off selling because I am going to take a HUGE fucking tax hit. State, Federal and Obamacare tax with over 400k in investment income is close to 29%.  I was hoping to avoid most of that.

I wasn't in the hospital for a vacation.  I was effectively blind most of the time, with a barely working cell phone that I had to hold inches from my face to read.  No laptop access, and didn't want to have someone digging around my house to get the private keys.  Which, even if I had, would have taken me several hours to combine the coins that I had spread over a couple dozen addresses. 
Was it possible? Yes.   But I had other things on my mind then, like if I was going to ever see properly again.

Listen asshole.  I said this already.  I held out hoping it would recover.  I very nearly sold when it hit 13,500 in late Jan and I didn't.  I got greedy.  I waited. I kept believing it will recover.   It didn't.  I FUCKED UP THEN.  Happy? That what you wanted to hear?
But where it is now, I can use the money.  I can easily spend $125,000 right now on shit that I kind of need.   Yes it SUCKS that I sold.  I'm not happy about it.  But I will be even more unhappy if it goes down to $2000 or $1500 or lower.

Bitcoin.  Some litecoin and ppcoin at the beginning.  But mostly bitcoin held for five and a half years or so.

I couldn't take the daily 10% dip anymore.  On a positive note, I guarantee it will start to go back up now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:26:42
It is a matter of perspective.  Past year I've been happy as shit having close to a million bucks.  I wanted to sell this time last year when it hit 18k but I couldn't.  Then it went down.  And I kept holding out hoping it would recover.  I would have stayed, but it is hitting a low that I don't want to risk it any further.  I can actually use the money rather than watch another 50% piss away like I just did with it dropping from 6500 to 3250.  
But yea, I am mentally oscilating between "damn I had a huge return" to "fuuuuuuck I had 2.2 million dollars"

If it keeps dropping?
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:39:01
I'm probably out for good.  I have a few coins that i use mostly for darknet purchases (more untraceable than the rest were).  Pay the taxes which are going to be huge.  And then wait to see what happens with the economy and start in lower risk investments like options and forex trading /s

No, but it was my selling point.  It would have left me with about 1.5M after taxes.  As soon as I could, i prepped to sell.  After it hit 18k I would have been completely happy selling even if it went higher.  It just didn;t recover.
