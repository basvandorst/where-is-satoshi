Time To Be Your Own Bank
You may have noticed that our pace of new feature blog postings has decreased to a trickle, compared to the frantic pace set three years ago when we started Coinkite.
We are incredibly proud of serving thousands of businesses and customers, transacting billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, but today we’re announcing that we are moving to the next phase at Coinkite.
We are winding down the web wallet part of Coinkite so that our team can focus on a number of new products that are more decentralized and embodied as hardware products. We’re still big Bitcoin fans, supporters and Hodlrs, and although Coinkite has been great adventure in the SaaS business, we want to spend more time where our heart is, hardware products, software-”not-as-a-service”, and other exciting new possibilities.
It’s time to focus on fulfilling Bitcoin’s real potential, and enable individuals and businesses to “Be Their Own Bank”.
Being a centralized bitcoin service does attract attention from state actors and other well funded pains in the butt, and as a matter of fact, we’ve been under DDoS since the first month we launched—over three years–yay. Plus we have put real fiat dollars into our lawyers’ pockets, to defend our customers from their own governments. This is not what we love to do, which is coding and delivering awesome services. 
What’s next for the team?
- Or you tell us, we’re listening!
- [Opendime.com]( Physical Bitcoin
- Completely standalone BTC terminal/hardware wallet with printer and QR scanner.
- Hardware products for authentication and security.
- General purpose stand-alone Bitcoin solutions.
- Hardened servers for hosting Bitcoin hot wallets  (sign up here 
Wind Down Plan
- Everything works as usual, but…
- No new user sign-ups will be accepted.
- No new API keys.
Please have patience with support as we expect extremely high email volume.
After 14 days:
- Tor access will end.
- API will be disabled.
- Prorated balances for annual pre-paid plans will be refunded.
- You will be encouraged to withdraw balances on login.
- New receive requests will be prevented (but existing deposits can still proceed).
- Zero balance accounts will be automatically closed.
After at least 30 days:
- All logins will lead to forced withdrawals.
After this point, we will look at how many deposits are still unclaimed and we will offer some sort of manual process to claim amounts. You will need to verify your email address, account name and also password before we do anything. We will maintain the HSMs to ensure access to the funds going forward.

Phishing Warning
Be aware that scammers may try to get you to log into a fake Coinkite to transfer (steal) your funds after this announcement. Please be very careful about emails which claim to be from us, telling you to do things, click on links and so on. We will update this blog post if there are any important changes. Check your memorable image before typing your password. If you forget your password, please start here:
