Me too. If there was a "shop" on the street next to a bank that sold bitcoins instead of calling itself a bank, then I would "shop" there instead of "banking" next door. Then I could take control of my own currency and I'd I needed to borrow money, I might go to a lender.

Fuck eBay and fuck Paypal and I can tell you why with a short quote from that article: 
"David Marcus, president of eBay's PayPal unit..... " 
"I think for us at PayPal..... " said Marcus in an interview with Bloomberg last week.
Bitcoin is better than eBay and they know it. eBay(read PayPal) are nobodies Pal's. They are the most ludicrous monopoly in the short history of human trade. 
They are not an oligopoly, and I think that distinction is critical. 
Wikipedia: 
An oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers (oligopolists).
A monopoly (from Greek monos μόνος (alone or single) + polein πωλεῖν (to sell)) exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity
If eBay(read again, Paypal) is interested in Bitcoin it can only be because;
1. They see it as a threat, or
2. They want to take it over and haven't figured out if they can, because if they could they already would have
3. It's pure PR

Yeah the comments seemed to be really weird, considering the article. But this is a UK article (controlled by the Russians) obviously derived from some sort of China state media release.

ebay(Paypal) will fuck you over every which way including how. They are an evil corporation and I think bitcoin is a way to bury them. 
While it would be great to instantly have such universal endorsement from such a "well respected and international corporation".... ["Paypal... handled no payments in 1998 but this year had 128 million active accounts and processed $US41 billion ($39.5 billion) in payments in three months."](

I just want to confirm that in the US "attempting" to buy drugs is the same as actually possessing or buying them in the eyes of the law? That's how "honeypots" work, right? 
I know it doesn't work that way here in Australia and I'm assuming that in order to prove this in court they would have to prove that this individual intended to exchange an item of value for an illicit substance? 
I would think that an actual drug dealer (with lots of bitcoins) could get their hardware seized but could use their phone call to tell someone the password to an online wallet (or if they could remember the address and password) to transfer the coins out and the court would be left looking at an empty wallet. Am I on the right track here?

What if a country (like Greece for example) launched their own crypto currency to replace their own? 
Perhaps they would start out using only government computers to mine, which progressively spread to the POS terminals and merchants. Then gradually replaced their own currency with a bitcoin like currency? 
It would be a great way for Greece to gracefully bow out of the Euro, and with the backing of a country (albeit with a debt riddled joke of an economy) perhaps they could get enough investment in it to start to pay back the money they owe to the Euro? 
Edit: And when I mean "backing of a country" I mean that the government would control all of the exchanges, and guarantee deposits in the same way that they "insure" bank deposits.

[Here's a link to a report of a report]( where Snowden says Pine Gap in Australia is a massive data collection centre for the NSA. The spike on that blockchain map looks pretty close to the location of Pine Gap (and there is nothing else out there). 
Thoughts? Harmless explanations? Tin hats for sale? 
Edit: [Here's a map]( with the locations he identified, transposed on the blockchain map. There are spikes at all the locations he mentioned (in Australia and New Zealand) with the exception of the Shoal Bay Receiving station near Darwin (no nodes appear there). 
And because my photoshop skills are not the best [Here's the direct link to the block chain live map]( which shows more accurately if you cross reference it. The node sizes are all pretty big (although my arrows don't point at the right ones maybe)

Not saying you are wrong, but there are a lot of explanations for a big bitcoin miner there. The big spike coming out of the middle looks to be near to Alice Springs. 
There are a lot of mines out there (actual digging shit up out of the ground type) as well as government (including US Government) installations like [Woomera test range]( and deep space labs.

It's an interesting idea, but I think it's got lots of holes. 
There would have to be a central database of everyone registered to vote with their unique identifier. 
This unique identifier would have to be communicated to the voter somehow, to enable them to vote. 
Lots of people would need access to that database. Meaning lots of people could potentially register voters and vote for them. 
Democracy wasn't built for billions of people, it was built for hundreds.

But the US and Australian Government run a deep space monitoring station there. As well as who else knows what. And it's interesting that all the other Australian/New Zealand sites mentioned by Snowden (with the exception of Darwin) all have huge node spikes.
