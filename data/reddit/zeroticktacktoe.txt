It is kinda. If you think that all of this was created studying human behavior during many years in stock market charted in graphics you can think that there is some logic, mostly is a representation of human behavior. And besides that the more people follows it, the more it happens and this is an important thing. Now, there is one thing that needs to be told. If people stoped to believe that this is a thing and realize that there is no purpose, future, or that is a shit technology and that there is no sense in buying it, so it will go way bellow the 8000.

My brother told me the first time and tried to explain to me about the miners, blockchain and stuff and the costs were around $ 300 and we thought, "oh too much, when it gets lower we enter", than one or two years later we talked again and it was $800 and we said "ohh it is too much, people are crazy". Than we saw it again and it was more than $1500. Finally I studied more about how it works, the 21 million limit and a video of Andreas Antoponoulos and I decided to buy it at $3800. The funny thing is that it wasn't that long ago, but I saw hard forks, bcash trying to replace bitcoin, so many bad news, fud!! I feel old!!! ( By the way, if I had bought at 300 I would sell it easy when it reached $1000)

Ok, so you should create a topic for you own announcing the end of bitcoin. Because honestly if you are here to open eyes of everybody then this is not a really efficient way. And if this is not you goal, you don't believe in bitcoin, you don't have a bitcoin why do you care??

Honestly, I don't think this was so manipulated or related to some event. They tried 3 times to go above the 14500 and couldn't passed it. In one of the times there wasn't  a wall, there was no buyers. So the sellers took advantage of it. The volume of tether being used in margin trade got lower after the end of december and this cause the prices to get lower. Besides that Binance is the large trader today and also a lot of people don't use tether anymore. So without the tether and margin trade no 20k bitcoins in short term.

If you could exchange tether by dollars at bitfinex that would be a problem because it could let to insolvency. But you can't, so as long they have the bitcoins and alt coins there  to be withdraw it is ok. 
Now for me the printing is basically a lot of people using margin trade. You deposit your tether and gains 3x tethers. Do you borrow this tethers from other person or does bitfinex lend you? If bitfinex lends you than that is why it is always increasing.

So, now it 9200. Lets see if in 30 minutes it will happen.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:45:09
I have an order for 8700. I imagine that is around the lowest it will hit. I access trading view to check other analysis and the 8000 correction is something really common there and is the price I imagine a lot of people has in their minds of the point of entrance. I was pessimist, until read the news that Binance, Bitfinex and Bittrex were not accepting new users and that in January, Binance, in one day accepted 250 thousand new users.

I thought it was OK if a bitcoin ETF was approved. But them I watched Andreas Antonopoulos and now I am completely against it. Andreas is great!!!!

He has gains really close to the SP500 in the last 10 years. So yes, it might have saved him some losses, but he didn't make anything more than the market.

I was thinking about it today, that the market crashed not because of the action of whales trying to short but because there was someone willing to sell bitcoins in order to attend a court order. It is good to know that whales have some power but not that much power.

The next audience is in September.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:01:14
I think during one of the swings he lost everything margin trading at bitfinex.

the problem is not the weak holders is the lack of confidence of people to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:25:58
With all this news informing that the trustee selling the bitcoins in the market dropped the price of bitcoin in 60%, I doubt he will sell it in the way he did.

It seems crazy but there are strange signs in the air. The debt of US government will increase in almost 1 trillion in 2018 and 1 trillion in 2019. China ( the largest holder of US treasury bonds ) will reduce the purchases of the treasury bonds in the next years which will lead to more increases of treasury bonds  yields and will reduce the amount of money available in market.  The S&amp;P500 felt due to the rise of treasury bonds yields last week. The increase of the yields will lead to a scarce money time and then trouble times for Wall Street. I saw one news today of recession in 2019.

In 2013 there were few exchanges, few people in the market and Mt. Gox was so huge that I imagine there weren't other options. Today is another game. See how many exchanges we have, binance, okex, bittrex, bitfinex, poloniex, bitflyer, kraken. It is more diversified. Bitcoin is also consolidating with great projects close to important milestones and reinventing itself.

I don't think he will sell it like he did in the beginning of the year. I wanted to know if there was any repercussion in Japan, with them having a large amount of bitcoins . But if he sells it in big batches and the prices goes to 2k-3k I wouldn't be sad. Imagine buy 5 bitcoins with 10k.
