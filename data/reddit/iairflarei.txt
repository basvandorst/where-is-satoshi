Fuel, ARN, TRX I think are pretty good ones. ARN has a pretty low volume amount. Big potential.

@_date: 2018-01-20 15:08:36
Yeah just leave it on exchange and use Gemini instead of Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:55:52

Use Gemini instead 
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:52:25
Gotcha so more nodes are being created by new people joint in or what? How does it expand?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:12:52
Wow this page has so much good information
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:54:08
It’s definitely going to keep going up after this big dip and January of every year seems to be the lowest month for bitcoin prices

Damn. Not sure how the economy will even out eventually 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:16:30
Usually I just do litecoin honestly. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:41:18
I would use Gemini you guys normally payments hit my bank account in one business day for withdraws and no withdraw fee. Best one to use in my opinion 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:49:24
What’s special about this router?
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:21:07
Heck yeah man let me know how it goes I’m curious about it!
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:23:45
It’s worth getting in it right now. January is the lowest month for crypto currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:17:56
Oh okay gotcha I was just curious cause I’ve never heard of one. So you’ve had good experience with it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:03:44
I’m saying to use Gemini to buy bitcoin instead because they don’t have withdraw fees or any of the fees Coinbase has but it does take awhile to get verified on Gemini tho 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:40:14
Bitcoins main selling point is that it was one of the most centralized crypto currency I think any other alt coins have potential to do the same at bitcoin has in the future. Only time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:23:18
The part about the different exchanges and stuff is great. I mean I knew about them but very well presented! It’s all neatly organized I like it!
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:26:08
I personally think trading is way better for making money than the mining contracts online
