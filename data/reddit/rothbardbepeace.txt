one value of bitcoin is that you can get capital from one country to any other with ease...and if using monero or some others in the deal you can do it without anyone knowing what is going on and without having to get permission...very useful for situations involving Iran, Venezuela, Cyprus and for ppl in other countries with taxing authorities similar to the IRS.

I think the value would plummet, but I do not believe it would plummet to nothing. It would be a great opportunity to buy as black markets would still use it...if only for intermediary between Monero and the sanctioned"legit" economy. Just as the value of crack and  heroin is not zero after 40 years of warfare ...and alcohol in the 20's...bitcoin would still survive and aid decentralized solutions to corrupt and inefficient governments.

people that HODL are actually doing there part to keep transaction fees low. If you are buying items or day trading with bitcoin then you are helping create the high transaction fees. 
The cool thing is that every drop in prices that has occurred because of a transaction fee clog up, has presented a wonderful opportunity to buy more btc for HODLers

I've been trading and working with natural gas traders the last 15 years. Some of the algo concepts I am working on for gas I think can be applied in some way to bitcoin.

Can he talk to people at the place he is sending money too? do they respond to emails?  I put .1 btc in 1-hash.com. The rates of return looked too good to be true, but I figured why not try? It seemed others were getting paid out and FOMO.
So it seemed to be working...they started allowing me to withdraw "profits" as they described on the website....so then I got excited...returns would make me rich in(pull out excel spreadsheet).
So then i sent .48 btc....very dumb, very naive
they took it. It is gone. They don't respond to any email. 
I have transaction ID and everything...happy to share the transaction ID and info:
these people are crooks and I was extremely gullible...hope you learn from my stupidity.
here you can see the .589 btc that was supposedly on deposit for me

it means gatekeeping...making sure that only verified millionaires get in early on investments is one function of the SEC.
Making sure that business that can threaten existing monopolies don't get lots of capital is another function of the SEC.
This is called regulatory capture and explains why Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and the old companies that benefit from current monopolies very much support the SEC and existing rules and fight disruption of that system.

Lots of things to answer there and I don't have time to give it the proper attention.
But I disagree that " a non-productive asset which is only attractive due to its speculative properties " is  accurate description of what crypto-currencies are.
BAT the currency behind Brave is about the decentralization of browser data tracking and everyone owns there data...only has to deal with ads they have opt-in for and the individuals get paid instead of google of Facebook. The browser hit 10 million downloads this month because it is faster and doesn't have as many ads....is it all working perfectly already ? no ...but it is interesting and I find the browser to work better on my phone that safari...I love that it is disrupting stuff.
Bitcoin is also used for some important things...there are over 200 countries/governments in the world...every year many of them place capital controls on their subjects. They all seek to profit off the individuals in the country by manipulating the currency and enforcing the currency monopolies. In many of these countries they get draconian and start confiscating bank accounts. Bitcoin offers protection to humans in these countries(Cyprus was a good example, Venezuala, Afghanistan, Iran, Zimbabwe are others). 
I think this a useful function and good for humanity.
If HODLing is a problem and it makes the currency useless what happens? the value goes down...as it has over the past year as the high transaction costs REALLY did make the currency useless. It is what it is.
If the value goes way down...then people who are stuck HODLing with it have strong incentives to improve it's usefullness. That is what has happened...Lightning network brought transaction costs way down and now prices have stabilized...cool. If you don't like it that is your freedom. I don't like everything in the world either.
as a personal code of values...I don't advocate outlawing stuff just becuase I don't like it. I only advocate outlawing stuff that I honestly personally think I would be willing to actually lock someone in a steel cage to prevent them from doing it. That is my ethical test I apply before supporting any law. If I feel I would not be willing to look someone in the eye and lock them in a cage I don't advocate outlawing it.
I pray that you find peace.

ICOs are great innovation. Lots of companies need to try and fail in order to facilitate brilliant new companies..  This unleashes a lot of disruptive competition for the gatekeepers and established powers and the .1%. It provides opportunities for the lower and middle class and upper middle to move into positions of power. It disrupts monopolies.
This is why the Jamie Dimon's and Warren Buffets hate ICOs fear bitcoin and choose to demonize crypto.
Yes many ICOs are scams...so are many SEC regulated companies. People need to get better at detecting scams and the only way they will do that is to practice and learn....that is what is happening...the rate of scams will go down in time as we develop expertise in analyising these things...this is a skill that a educated populace needs to have in a advanced civilization...it is too important a skill to be outsourced to the Donald Trumps, the Hillary Clintons of the world. We do not need corrupt politicians outlawing investment opportunities and deciding what buisness are allowed to raise capital.

Obviously at some point in a crazy bullrun...behaviors change and it gets to some point where selling gets big, but that will be a while.

As a percentage of the ATH that $170 would be comparable to $2610 this time around...it could happen. I'm kinda using that as my mental scenario for biggest dip possible...so that I don't get too leveraged too soon.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems the cycles are trending in the longer direction. Judging by the average(and growing ) length of time between the ATH and the next bottom...I am guess the bottom has not occurred yet....I think It happens in November. Obviously...your guess could be better!

LN is important to the near term success of bitcoin. Transaction costs were way too high to maintain growth in currency usage. However, I can see flowbrother's point. LN was a innovation that was going to come in one form or another. Critical mass of billions of dollars and talented human labor was focused on solving the scaling problem. Scaling problem is being solved...that type of thing is inevitable from a big picture perspective.

My opinion is that market making algorithms are getting more active in the market. While many of us here are mooners/hodlers. The professional market making community comes to every market that shows some promise of growing. 
I see that the price is at $6500 again today...seems to me that there is a growing presence of market making algorithms operating that will buy low /sell high with relatively low risk . On the one hand this is good for helping keep a solid bottom in place....on the other...it provides a bit of a roof for rapid advancement of price in the short term...which can lead to one of two things
1. lack of upward trend eventually frustrate/discourage some hodlrs and causes them to sell and we get new lows
2. stability leads to more dollar cost averagers joining the savings program...continued organic growth fuels price higher...market maker ceiling gets blown through at some point.
Because I am optimistic on this technology/movement, I think  is just a matter of time ... new bull market will start in 1-6 months.

I never liked Tether's concept. It was based on no-coiner opinions of why bitcoin was not a good investment( "that it was too unstable, needs to be more stable like the good old government fiat currencies")....that has always been a dumb criticism IMO. 
People wanting to get in early on picking the next world currency are not interested in a currency that consistently goes down in value year after year like the USD..they want something that will go up in value every decade against the USD. Bitcoin is pretty good at that so far. Tether is stupid.

Lower transaction fees helps increase transactions in long run. High transaction fees during the 2017 spike temporarily killed off 90% of the non-speculation related transactions.

I agree with much of what your saying freeradicalx, however I also think TPTB will do everything they can to prevent the value of treasuries from collapsing....they debt payments in the federal budget would skyrocket and take up the entire budget if rates rise to 10%...so they will have to keep doing more spurts of QE until that is completely normalized...and so the USD quantity is going to keep going up along a exponential  curve just as BTC has done...a lot of inflation can be masked with technology improvements...I don't know/how when it all gets crazy....but something will break ...maybe during the next real Bitcoin run? 
In the past, when we have had a 70 day period with 25 new ATH then we have been near a cycle peak in the past. ...whatever the price is at that point I will get skittish during this coming cycle..

I heard someone say that the whole purpose of bitcoin is to make it where evil governments cannot arbitrarily confiscate money. I know that bitcoin has weaknessess in that area and is extremely traceable...but if you accept that many governments tend towards evilness like Pol Pot or Sadam Hussein , Operation Northwoods, Saudi Arabia etc...then maybe it is best for humanity to focus on ways to increase individual soveriegnty as opposed to paying off  bad actors. Obviously pay the US government as much ass possible their bombs are always just meant for attacking evil...and US government is great and much good and pay the IRS ASAP....just sorta thinking of other people, not everyone is super lucky like ppl in the US.

It really does seem a lot of programming resources are going into improving some of the bitcoin infrastructure and making apps that will be more user friendly.

I don't see how they can track Monero very easily. Take it off exchange and then buy Monero with bitcoin ...not that I am worried about it. All my crypto purchases have been 100% losses or donations.

@_date: 2019-01-04 17:20:07
likely ...yes.
However...I also think it is true that if politicians currently still 1 billion/year in Uruguay and spend it all on Coke and hookers....then shifting 50% of that money to technology startup incubation facilities...zero taxes for companies less than 3 years old...free (housing and office space) rewards for the top 1000 young companies(voted on by a panel of college student body presidents? or some other semi random selection of people less likely to be corrupt).
Is this silly plan I am laying out susceptible to waste? yes corruption? yes 
stupid businesses? yes 
all sorts of other problems you see with socialist programs? yes
but would it be more popular and help more people than dropping bombs on afgahnistan or supporting coke and hooker industries? yes

Having extra money would only enable these activities...I pay into 401k in a depreciating currency because wall street lobbies for tax rules that essentially funnel $ into their coffers.  If I ever made more than enough to pay for any of my existing expenses and IRS stay-out-prison-bribes then I would be happy to cut more checks to the man.

Even if the government is largely successful in attacking crypto...there is a huge growth in the ideas of freedom since the 1990's when I started getting into libertarian books. Do you see the large proportion of crypto-millionaires and billionaires who are largely influenced by libertarian philosphy...even if they are infighting amongst themselves...the % of wealth and power held by anarcho-libertarian people is hug now compared to 25 years ago. The ideas being spread and proven to help people succeed is almost like science fiction type progress compared to back in 1993.
I understand how hard it can be have optimism when you look around and see astounding violence perpetuated by governments and morally justified by people who should know better ....and it used to be very easy for me to descend into a cynical pessimism when I saw the ridiculous stuff going on...but it did NOT help me...It only helps to go out and interact with people(even if they are communist or republicans)...I have found that talking and building trust by working together with these people without trying to show them how they are wrong has made a difference. I lost my fear and my anger and gained an ability to actually follow through on some concrete actions AND made friends and ended up convincing some people that thye had things to learn as well.

This is what finally got me to invest. I didn't like bitcoin when I first read about it in 2010. The ability to track every transaction seemed like exactly what the government would want?! so like NO.
But now I think "if I know they are implementing the system so they can track every transaction ever....it would be full on stupid to wait until everyone else invests" ...especially if part of their strategy for bringing about one-world currency is to crash the old system("out of chaos...order") obviously there are some problems with inflating fiat currency forever.
Still I don't really understand how in-control "they" really are...I don't know what is happening and what every person's motives are...but saving money in bitcoin on the whole...seems like a good store of value compared to a lot of things so I hope it works....I also hope the human potential of all the poor underbanked impoverished nations comes to some fruition in my lifetime...it really sucks to see all the poverty and suffering that goes on in many poor nations due to simple problems that could be solved.

Agreed, not only does it discredit him, in the long run... It helps discredit corrupt institutions like the NYT others who treat him as some great liberal intellectual ...who in reality seems to have zero concern for millions of poor people living under corrupt governments.

TA can mean a lot of things. 
If you buy DCA style when the price is below 80% of the 200 Day MA and sell around 2% at each new daily ATH after the price exceeds 2x the 200 day MA then you'd be happy.
Trace Mayer told people to do roughly that and it was good advice.

Huan at least is very aware of the realities of counterfeiting old currency vs crypto...krugman was speaking untruths that just happen to support the idea that government monopolies over currency is a good way to to.

Suppose the government/banking cartel only printed money to do two things:
1. issue loans for people to buy houses
2. issue loans for people to pay college tuition
At first this will seem like a nice thing. More people than before will be able to afford to go to college and buy their first house.
Over time you might see the prices of those goods rise. The percentage of the population that attends college will rise, the % than have their own home(owned by a bank) will also rise.
The people earning interest on the loans make bank. They lobby for more regulations and programs that benefit them.
The prices of houses and tuition will also rise. After about 70 years the average college tuition might be about equal to the average annual salary instead of 1/10 the average annual salary.
The  average 2 BR house in one of the 10 biggest cities in the country might be about 10 times the average annual american salary instead of equal to the average American salary....eventually  the bottom 60% spends all their income on taxes and interest payments and only the top 10% own a home.
So I think they are saying people who pay all of their income on taxes and interest with little chance of ever owning or saving money are slaves. I don't necessarily agree ...but I do think a sound/transparent monetary policy would benefit a lot of people and help limit corruption and decentralize some of the power.

low and declining volatility with rising MA for BTC price has  been a marker of some of the best times to buy bitcoin in the past ten years.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:22:47
 Currently we are in day 90 with no ATH.
In BTC price history, there have only been three previous times that the ATH has held for this long.
The three times included: a 1176 day gap with a min price that was 15% of the prev ATH. equivalent bottom for current mkt = $2,958
 a 632 day gap with a min price that was 7% of the prev ATH. equivalent bottom for current mkt = $1,262
 a 194 day gap with a min price that was 38% of the prev ATH. equivalent bottom for current mkt = $6,611
I would not be surprised if the current bear market ends up being close to the simple average of these three previous ones. This would imply a bottom of $3,600 that will occur on 218 day from the ATH = July 25th 2018. From that point it would take until October 17, 2019 to hit a new ATH....so that in itself will be a ripping bull market.
Obviously that is all based on a very simplistic and arbitrary assumption that the current bear ends up being the average of the three previously mentioned....it could be anything. 
In any case I am dollar cost averaging and will be quite happy if this bear market ends up being similar to the 3 worst in history.

I hear people saying "ya but they have plenty of capital ...the loans are risk free....the banks deserve to get great terms on loans from taxpayers because they have GREAT credit!!"
It is shocking to hear this line of "logic", because without the bailouts we are told they would have been bankrupt and they would not have been able to continue operating....so they have great capital right now because we loaned them money...and they can borrow on incredible terms because WE loaned them money...and we CANNOT borrow on great terms because we need to pay these banks a good spread so they can make awesome profits now and forever.

It is going to have a bigger affect on directing human focus and investment in better and cheaper ways to generate electricity.
Wholesale Electricity prices are dropping around the world.
Electricity prices were hugely dependent on location and time before. This is the first time i human history that electricity on top of a volcano in thee pacific ocean at midnight can be just as valuable as in Chicago.
Previously big government/utility monopolies severely limited electricity generation improvements....Utilities are crying now because business models are being destroyed.
Electricity prices will continue to decline. I have been in Natgas business for 20 years. The technology innovation in solar/wind/battery/distributed gen/hydrogen etc is going to radically change some things over the next decade and people are under appreciating it.

The link to watch capacity is not working for me. Anyone have a different link or method of monitoring this fundamental data series?
@_date: 2018-07-02 00:07:44
thanks...I was not sure. Still I currently have no way to even monitor an estimate of the LN transactions. I do think the growth of the low transaction cost network is crucial.

it will still be 10% on credit cards...3-5% on mortgages....the negative rates just means the federal reserve will be sending dollars to the big banks consistently....who then in turn lend it out to us little people at approximately the same rates they have been doing. 
A good way to combat this is to borrow to buy crypto.

free unlimited line of credit to big banks. When you have 100 billion dollar guaranteed LOC you can move markets and profit and if they scheme doesn't work you go back and borrow 200 billion whenever you want because there is a unlimited supply of credit available if  you are one of the too big to fail(TBTF).
Essentially if you make a risky bet and it doesn't work you get debtors prison/bankruptcy/wage slave status....if TBTF does the same thing they just borrow 2x more and make bigger bets and "pay it all back with interest....SEE GREAT DEAL for taxpayer!!"

the problem was that it was a crap currency for transactions....who wants to lose $10 in transaction cost on a $30 transaction? not me...now that trnsx cost are low again I'd think about possibly spending some and buying back more if it is convenient....not gonna just spend transaction dollars for the fuck of it.
I buy btc every couple weeks with the assumption that the convenient transactions and cool apps will spread around the world in the next 10 years. Not my job to try and pretend we are there yet.

still above the 270 day moving average...there have been a couple of times in the past when BTC hits 50% of the 270 day moving average. I expect it to happen again at some point....although it could be a long while. Basically the weekly accumulation strategy has worked very well at times like this in the past. With the lightning network growth and super low transaction fees ...I am doing the weekly purchase strategy from here on in...e until we get another ripping bull where price &gt; 5x(270 moving average)

and each of the two decisions "Rannasha" accurately describes is also affected by the miners belief in the future value of bitcoin. Not every miner immediately sells every mined bitcoin. Every miner has their own decision making process for that.

I don't think "rat poison" is really a threat to a actual government that has the biggest and most sophisticated military and financial system the world has ever seen.

It could always go either way, but this is the third big long running bear market since bitcoin has been traded. The first ATH to ATH cycle was 1 year. The 2nd was closer to 2 years. I would not be surprised if this one was three years or 1.6 x 2 years (golden ratio) 3.2 years...with the trough coming halfway through the cycle...meaning June of 2019. It seems to me the network is still improving, lightning network etc. This looks like a nice time to accumulate.

Bitcoin is definitely a "game" designed specifically for ordinary players. If there is another cycle similar to the last two then yes I think altcoins and other decentralized projects will have higher growth and returns a well..something like BAT or elastico etc.

you can replicate code infinitely...but you cannot replicate the physical network of miners...software set up to make transactions more user friendly...the entire software ecosystem set up to make new apps around it etc. so in that sense....each new coin or blockchain does not devalue btc

I don't know if high IQ is really that important...just started scaling out some 1% each day the Mayer Multiple gets higher than 2.5. Double scale out when MM is above 2.5 and the price is below the 5 day moving avg.
 Always scale back in when the Mayer Multiple is below 1.0...double scale back in when Mayer multiple is below .5. 
Mayer Multiple = the price/200 day Moving Avg. when the price is more than 2.5 greater than the 200 day MA the market is starting to get too popular and attract weak-FOMO-hands
This is not a crazy strategy.
