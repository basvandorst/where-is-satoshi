I'm a developer for Cryptsy. MattSmith in cryptsy chat on rare occasion. I am at our office every single day, even the weekends, to continue to bring up Cryptsy to a wonderful crypto haven. Something more than just an exchange. The old picture was of the old office literally 5 minutes down the same road the new office is on. The company was growing and we needed more space. We still own BOTH offices. One is empty yes, because Paul hasnt found anyone to sublease the old building too because he is still under contract to own it. Please, we can show you around the office and yes even buy you lunch if you come on buy. I prefer to know ahead of time but we'll be there from 9am-roughly 6 or 7pm every day.

I should comment the ip was 40.122.133.253 . Since I've changed my password I have had many failed logins from the ips 117.255.225.236 , 189.219.53.76, and 187.161.229.154

Same thing happened to me about a month ago, I filed a support ticket to BTC-E and they said it was on me to secure my account. Although it was a completely random password that was used specifically for their site only. I shrugged it off at the time but now Im very curious whats really going on.
