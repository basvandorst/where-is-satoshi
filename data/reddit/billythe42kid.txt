I believe it's shut down completely. I think many people are in mining pools / their own wallets now.
Classic story of crypto - if it's not in your wallet you don't own it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:36:26
Right now Monero
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:20:24
0.5% (0.005) iirc
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:40:42
I panicked and bought more. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:49:11
Agree 100%. Mainstream news isn't what it once was. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:23
Fortunately we're not robots and can understand things in context.

Sales tax.

@_date: 2017-12-16 23:12:51
Hardly. They're directly comparable. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:20
They likely don't know the difference. 
Cryptocurrency mining is profitable for anybody with a slightly modern GPU. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:35:49
Right now, Monero. My electricity bill went up about $1 a day, I'm mining about $12 in Monero a day (for now). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:49:02
I definitely expect to see 1 million bitcoin in my lifetime. I can see 10. I wouldn't be too surprised by 100 million. 1 billion would surprise me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:18:47
Not every coin, there's like 3-4 in the top 100 that are up.
But ya looks rough haha
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:02:31
I've got a 1080 in my pc, and 1070s in my spare pc and couch computer. You can also use your CPU for some coins. An i7 can make a bit. 
This tells you what is most profitable to mine:
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:50:27
I would agree except people have been screaming "BUY BITCOIN" for the last 7 years so..
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:12:01
Every computer *can* mine, only high end ones will be very profitable (and only by a few dollars per day). I have 3 going during the winter so I don't have to turn the heat on. 
tl;dr yes
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:40:22
That ignores inflation and other forms of wealth. The US dollar isn't going up. In 50 years not only will the USD be worth significantly less but the world's economy will be many times larger.
I needed says it will reach 100m in 60-70 years, I said I wouldn't find it surprising.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:45:09
lol hopefully one day!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:50:27
When billionaires/millionaires start buying lots of bitcoin the price is going to skyrocket.. 
I mean I'm sure many of them have some now, but if a rush ever starts...
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:31:28
I was playing a 90 min game of dota while the whole thing went down. 
There's smart money, dumb money, and apathetic money. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:54:21
With my bank, if I take money out / spend money / transfer money from my savings account I get a fee ($5, I seriously hate my bank) but with my checking account there is no fee. I keep most of my money in my savings account (since it gets interest while my checking doesn't) and transfer money online (no fee) to my checking account as I need it. 
With crypto I see keeping the majority of your money in bitcoin but keeping a small amount (idk maybe $100-200?) in something like litecoin or ethereum for small transactions (buying a coffee!). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:36:17
I make $12 mining Monero a day. Then I sell it for bitcoin. 
It's not THAT hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:48:23
For the moment I see Bitcoin as a (very high interest) savings account while Litecoin/Ethereum as the checking account. 
Lightning may change this :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:14:56
I for one prefer to use other cryptos when I can, but ya, I think a lot of people would use the lightning network. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:39:42
My electric bill went up about $1 a day.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:23:30
Huh? Most new highways are paid for by tolls now. Also if taxes went to the roadways they wouldn't have been in decline for so many years.
[Tax money just "disappears" anyways, so why pay it?](
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:38:50
Ya they're both garbage really. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:43:12


we'll see bro
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:44:41
Same. I worked with one guy that graduated top of his class at Beijing University. He is WAY smarter than I'll ever be. I thought it was awesome just to work near somebody so intelligent and accomplished. 
Some people just can't accept there are people out there superior to them in every way. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:37
Basically the story of Reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:01
I'll buy/gift it to you if you want to pay me in Crypto. I can give you my email / cell number / contact info so you know I'm legit.

Ripple is only -1% and it's 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:47:38
For some people it's a hobby, for some people they hope it goes up in price ($12 of bitcoin now might not be much, but in a few years it could turn out to equal $120 a day). 
For some people they look at it as a cheap way to heat your home in the winter. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:21:36
If rich people don't pay taxes why should middle class people?

The best thing you can do is go to whitetomine and find what is most profitable for you. If you don't care and just want to mine something:
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:12:32
I thought recently the fees were contributing more to the miners profits than the block rewards?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:46
Comments like this kept me from mining until recently. 
Mining is definitely profitable, and you can do it with your own computer now if you have a fast enough GPU. Obviously don't mine bitcoin, but there are hundreds of things you can mine and sell for bitcoin and make ~$3-4 a day. I put all my computers on it and make about $12 a day. 
I should have known better than to believe random comments on Reddit lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:48:37
Bonus points if you sell everything you mine for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:39:28
As far as I know many miners use Linux, I see no reason you can't use a mac. It is outside of my area of knowledge though, you may have to compile the miners yourself.

1. Medical isn't free
2. Private schools
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:39:55
Right now Monero. I change to whatever is most profitable though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:58
Right now I'm mining Monero (XMR) but I switch depending on what's most profitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:36:53
$65 a month, it was about $35 before I started mining. 0.12cents/kwh where I live. I'm in an apartment. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:47:10
At $1 I thought it was too late. At $35 I thought it was too late. At $100 I thought it was too late. At $1000 I thought it was too late.
I finally bought it at $5000. It wasn't too late. Still isn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:40:43
It's easy to get addicted. It's a fascinating thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:36:24
I did some more reading and it looks like it'll be handled the same way as Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:53:48
I would say paying in bitcoin kinda sucks, my last fee for a $50 transfer was $5. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:05:46
And the buys flooded in
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:34:52
True. Lots of us can't use gdax (wrong country)
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:25:17
I'm counting on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:51:37
When/if btc crashes the great alt moon will rise!
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:09:23
Don't worry, it WILL crash again, then it will moon again, and the cycle continues. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:10:28
Gdax will be in the same situation as Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:08:48
Depends on the cost of electricity in your area. Google around for mining profitability calculators.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:10:28
Canadians can't :(
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:48:05
How fast is their currency crashing though?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:46:42
When it hit $100 I thought "shit, I was too late"
Then it hit $1000 and again I thought "damn, I was wrong, but now it's too late"
Then I bought at $5200, thinking "I'll only buy a little, it'll probably crash down soon"
I'm slowly learning lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:54:41
Unless he sold, then he might cry a little. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:52:26
I tried a credit union once but they couldn't setup a wire transfer to the US for me and the fees were way higher. Maybe it's a Canadian credit union thing, or maybe everybody I talked to was clueless. 
Either way I kinda had to go back to an old fashion bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:36:25
This guy moneys.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:20:26
Oh, you can set it yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:34:13
I recently told a friend I think bitcoin is cool and worth looking into. He said "it's like 8 grand for one coin. I'm not buying that."
I tried to tell him you don't have to buy a whole coin, to which he responded 
"Then what's the point?"
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:30:41
Consider that a lot of people are new to the crypto game and not aware of this. Yes, they should read and figure it out, but the scammers are the criminals. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:51:48
All hail Lord Nakamoto!

You don't understand what he's saying. But to be fair he said it in a kind of complicated way. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:28:34
Some time between tomorrow and a year from now. Maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:41:46
They should buy ETH
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:39:01
If bitcoin goes up so will Eth, but not as much.
If bitcoin goes down so will Eth, but not as much.
It's like a buffer. You're probably fine going 100% btc. Personally I have 20% Eth just in case.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:38:32
10k by the end of the year? More like by the end of next week...
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:09:25
Different areas are going to have different adoption rates. I would love to see the geographic stats for the new coinbase users. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:17:41
Do you know if my coin is safe on gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:38:20


Ah, the golden days of the internet. It'll never be that way again.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:56:44
It will be eventually, because inflation. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:04:35
I'm 60/40 in BTC/ETH.
I think on paper ETH might be better than btc (disclaimer* I'm no expert) but BTC has the momentum and attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:55:40
I was asking about where to keep my btc and how to get them "split"
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:24:40
Which stock?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:44:01
4k and if double down
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:53:21


If your current heating is electric and you already have the hardware, yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:33:06
Imo blame the scammers not the victims
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:49:43
There is definitely a market for custom built gaming PCs. You just gotta hype them up on craigslist or ebay. Or, hear me out, sell your PC. Overprice it. If somebody buys it, build a new one and do the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:28:44
I really hope you're right.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:37:52
My wife told me it's too risky but I can do what I want with my disposable. I bought fewer games, fast food, still using my old snowboard, etc. But now I have BTC. And now she wants to buy some too.

"Damnit billy stop it with your fancy college words"
I wish I was joking :(
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:16:57
Same. I'll hodl until a correction. If no correction comes? Well I still have a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:34:27
I tried, said not available in your country ;)
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:52:12
I've been using Ethereum for all of my "small" transfers. Low fees and fast confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:44:12
Definitely safest, but not optimal. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:29
No idea, I still don't get how to determine fees until I get them. I'll figure it out eventually. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:40:06
Ya, comparing to gold makes more sense than comparing to companies. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:11:16
That's awesome, thanks for linking it. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:56:21
Depends where you live. 6 figures in Palo Alto is almost poor. In some parts of Cleveland it's rich. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:35:57
Very true. It won't be easy. I read they're considering "outlawing" btc in China.. that could get messy. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:02:05
From my understanding the ETH algorithm is memory bound instead of CPU bound, so an ASIC miner would have to have many GB of ram, which ends up making it less efficient to make.*
disclaimer* I read this somewhere and have no idea if it's actually true. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:08:03
Nooo, I want it to crash so I can buy more :(
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:50:27
I'm guessing a drip to 4000-4500 before it starts going back up. It's fun to speculate!
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:57:17
Plz plz plz crash to 2k or 3k so I can buy more lol
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:15:08
imo is a good goal
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:27:01
I mean, I'm already in, I just want in more. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:19:21
You are of course right. The higher end of 6 figures would be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:50:26
So.. I should keep commenting until it hits 10k?

I'll change it to the actual link.
I'm guessing it's been ghost removed already though?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:10:02
How would they know? Keep it in BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:31:38
Which is really interesting since so many cab companies said uber would never work.

Not OP but I buy from [Coinbase]( and use the Electrum wallet.
I'm going to get a physical wallet though.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:30:55
The first thing you need to look at is the cost per kwh in your area - how expensive your electricity is. It's about 0.14 cents for me. 
If you're lucky enough to live somewhere where the electricity is included in the rent you're laughing. 
Last I checked the Radeon R9 295X2 was the "best" for gpu mining ethereum, but that might have changed. The things you're concerned about are efficiency (MH per KWH) and hash rate MH/s.
I'd google around for a guide. Somebody else also mentioned they were able to get some cheap gpu's off of ebay (1080s, 1070s) for like $300-400 each, which is awesome. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:12:10
My last apartment had "free" electricity included in the strata fees. 
So really, my neighbors were paying my bills...
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:38:38
Maybe. That's why I'm ~~holding~~ hodlng. But I speculate it will do another dip before it hits the moon~
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:29:52
That was 2014, I'm sure that guy kept mining and did OK. 
But.. OK is not 50 mill haha
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:13:58
I'm guessing in about a month
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:40:17
I wonder where we would be today without the pizza. It made headlines, It got attention. Too bad we can't see alternate timelines!
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:09:24
Mine Ethereum, sell Eth for BTC, ???, Profit
There aren't any ASIC miners for eth (yet?) so GPU mining eth is much more profitable. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:59:18
Is that against the rules? I actually found coinbase on r/Bitcoin, and it was a referral link when I did. 
edit* it isn't even, it's a link to the coinbase app on google play which isn't a referral, since there are no referrals to google play afaik
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:37:32
I'm actually hoping for a crash lol
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:05:44
Fees too high
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:14:02
My thoughts exactly!
