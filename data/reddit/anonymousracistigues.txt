Horse shit.  Him and his gang were raking in millions by actively encourage copyright infringement on their site.  




Mega Site user entitled “video problems.” The e-mail described, “I’ve been trying to watch Dexter episodes, but… the sound doesn’t match up with the visual… I didn’t choose to use your site, you seem to dominate episodes 6 and 7 of Dexter on alluc[.org, a linking site].” DOTCOM forwarded the e-mail to ORTMANN and wrote, “… on many forums people complain that our video / sound are not in sync… We need to solve this asap!” “Dexter” is a copyrighted television series on the premium cable channel Showtime.


ECHTERNACH entitled “attention.” The e-mail contained a link to a news article entitled
“Pirate Bay and Megaupload Escape Domain Seizure by US.” The article discussed how, **“[a]s part of an initiative to crack down on Internet piracy and counterfeiting, the US Government recently took action against sites making available movies and TV shows.” In the e-mail, DOTCOM stated, “this is a serious threat to our business. Please look into this and see how we can protect ourselfs.” DOTCOM also asked, “Should we move our domain to another country (canada or even HK?)”** ECHTERNACH responded, “In case domains are being seized from the registrar, it would be safer to choose a non-US registrar[.]”

I think I should have put my money in TSLA two years ago when it was $30 instead of BTC at $200

It does a terrible job of it.  IRS is still able to seize assets. What this is saying is that if you have bitcoin, and you're accused of breaking the law, you can further break the law by hiding assets in bitcoin.  
If you want bitcoin to be seen as legitimate, don't advocate it as a means of committing financial crimes.

Not really mining.  Sounds more like selling CPU resources and being paid in bitcoin.  But not for profit.  He keeps saying not for profit, probably because there is no profit to be had.

If the money was earned illegally, then it isn't really his money.  The state should freeze it when there is a question of whether he has legitimate ownership claims to it, or if other people may have claims to it.
Let's use a simple illustration.  Suppose he was arrested for robbing a bank.  Two weeks ago he had $0.  Today he has $1,000,000.  Police arrest him, and he can't explain where that $1,000,000 came from.  Court freezes the funds until after the criminal trial because the state claims he does not own that money legally.  Why would the state want to give him access to that money so he can piss through it on an expensive legal defense and $11,000 a month in food?  Once the case is done, he's going to have pissed through all of that money, and the people he stole from will have no chance of recovering what was rightfully theirs. 
If dotcom cannot show that the money in question was already legally his and not illegally gotten through his criminal enterprise, then the state should freeze it during the course of the trial.  If he cannot afford an attorney or food during that time, the court should appoint an attorney for him and provide him food stamps.

Because it's not mining.  I have 25% of my CPU currently being used.  Think folding but more commercialized where a company could buy massive amounts of unused cpu usage around the world on billions of chips and pay those computer owners in bitcoin.  
I'm listening to the episode now.  They're also talking about having drones automatically pay landowners for using their airspace. So the bitcoin is used as a payment method. 
That is the idea I'm getting out of this podcast.

What the fuck does this have to do with bitcoin?

Does this qualify as anti-trust?

Bitcoin valuation is not really a "market cap" but a money supply.

What OP did

Then call it the money supply valued in USD.  Market cap  is the value of a corporation's shares.  Shares are not the same thing as currency.   What happens when people refer to bitcoin in terms of money capitalization is they do exactly as you did by comparing it to corporation market cap.  
Singapore has a money supply of 519 billion, that doesn't mean they are smaller or have a lower GDP, or anything else really compared to  Apple.

Fuck this asshole.  He is the last person who should be criticizing anyone.
