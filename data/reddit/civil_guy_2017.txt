Ive been buying bitcoin on Coinbase at $200 a pop with a $2.99 fee. Or 1.5%. 10 transactions would cost $30. Or 1.5% of $2000. That seems reasonable. And a $2000 buyin is $29.36.

Im by no means any type of expert. Found out this type of stuff at r/financialindependance. I wish i would have known a lot more before I picked up students loans and started having kids.  I would've done a lot of things differently.  A little financial independance will go a long way.

Its important to note, that in retirement you are limited to spending what you were when you were working. The idea is pretty simple. If the market averages 7% increase, and inflation averages 3%. Then if you limit your yearly withdrawels to 4% of your savings, your principal wont ever decrease and last the rest of your life.

So, lets say in june i took  my bitcoins off of coinbase and into an offline wallet. And i throw that wallet in my safe at home. Then there is a hard fork in August.  So now, since I had bitcoin during the hardfork i should have some bitcoin cash...how do i claim that bitcoin cash?

Dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:15:52
Sory about the webpage. Maybe try a different browser. All you really need is the graph on it though. It has your savings rate and the years it takes to retire.  Pick what you can save and it shows how long until you can retire.

Instead of investing 2k at once, buy 200 ten times over a certain period.

No. I actually would like more. The wife thinks four is enough. we'll see. We've had two. And were trying to adopt a few more.
If possible, i would have waited to have kids. But given my wife's health, we both agreed that pregnancies at an older age wouldnt be wise. We decided that we would stop having kids at 34. But, we got married at 25, and hadnt finished school until 27.  So we had from 27-34 to have kids. So we did. We took 2.5 years for the first and another 2 for the second pregnancy.
It would've been nice to work and play for 3-5 years, pulling in 6 figures together. But that just wasnt in the cards for us.
The biggest things i would have done differently. 1. No student loans above tuition.  2. Go to community college first (cheaper, and easier. Allows more time to feel out possible future careers without paying a large 4 Year college). 3. Get CDL right after high school. Truckers make good money. Find a route you can do while in school. So instead of working for min. wage at american eagle, you can work a job that pays enough to support a family. 4. Start an IRA and just put something in it every month...even just 1 dollar. 5. Get more/better experience within my career while in school.
I have an amazing wife, amazing kids and an amazing career that will allow us all the fruits of a middle class life. But paying more for my students loans than our mortgage sucks. 
Our new goals are: Debt free except for mortgage by 35. House paid for by 45. Semi-retire by 55. The good thing about having kids early,  Your empty nesters early. Id rather have an empty house when im 55 and at the peak of my earning potential when i have the health, time and money to enjoy it all.

How do people 'store' dollars? Are saving accounts in just pesos or could you specify USD? Or do people hold physical dollars?

I generally agree with what your saying, which is why im hodlng even though we could use a little cash right now.
However, even though there is only 21 million bitcoins, whats stopping one from creating another crypto exactly lile bitcoin to fill the need for it since the original is limited. (Im thinking bcash and litecoin.) If this happened it would limit the value of bitcoin?
I hope that makes sense. Im just trying to play through all reasonable scenarios.

Its not a patriotoc righteousness. Theres a reason walmart lets trashy people in their store. Money. China is walmart and the US are its customers.  China just doesnt have zero reasons to go to war with the US, it has trillions of reasons not to.
Thats why you see all of the shit they do. None of it is enough to ever really piss us off enough to do anytjing militarily, while they have whole divisions in their army dedicated to hacking the US and its corporations; stealing IP etc.  If theu ever got an upper hand economically, things may change drastically.

'I think most are trying to avoid that'...thats the point. Theres a misconception that china is waiting on pins and needles for the US to make a misstep so they can go to war with us. They want to avoid war more than us. Their economy depends on the US way nore than the us economy depends on china.

Or recognizing value. I dont need a porshe. But if someone was selling one for a hundred bucks, id buy it. It would be great value. If one believes that the real value of bitcoin will be higher than what it is now based on deflation, btc characteristics etc, then its not gambling. Just value investing.

I didnt KNOW this, but its the what I created to remember. Everytime i read an article and they say bear or bull, i had to google which was which. Until i thought if a bull thrust his heaf up to attack or a bear swiping down to attack. Then instead of googling i just imagined them fighting.

I think its obvious when one says that 1 btc is still 1 btc, theyre alluding to the underlying characteristics of btc that make it great. 1 zimbabwean is still 1 zimbabwean, but we dont invest in that because its a shitty fiat currency controlled by a government infested with corruption. Btc on the other hand is decentralized, etc.

I dont think i have enough available fiat to get it that low. Thatd be nice.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:36:52
Is there any good resoirce that explains the benefits of an etf. As far as a decentralized currency goes, it seems like an etf is just a way for large institutions to hoard bitcoin using other peoples money.

But due to inflation i would have less value than if i just kept my money in dollars between yesterday and today. Thats a guaranteed value loss with dollars, and a maybe value loss if I put my money in bitcoin. But im not talkijg about yesterday and today. Im thinking about yesterday and 2025. Where, i could beat i flation by 4-ish oercent in the market...or make mich larger gains with bitcoin...im hoping for somewhere in the 500-1000% range.  But all this depends on where i value bitcoins versus dollars...and I cant wait to use bitcoin as much as i do dollars.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:28:33

I always like to take a gander at the old google trends for bitcoin.  In the 5 year graph, the high was obviously in December of 2017.  When the price spiked to 20k.  Now were at 10-11K and the number is only 12. It spiked in May 2019 to a 15 on this scale. But that is crazy, to think that there was 6-7 times more interest when it only went to 20K and were at 10K now.  As the price pumps, the interest pumps.  I wonder how high it would go if the interest in the next 6-12 months matched the interest in December 2017.

My big price target is 1 btc = 1 btc
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:26:01
During 2018, I was DCA over the year. But as the price kept falling I kept kicking myself mentally for not selling some when it was at 20K.  So I made a plan  that when it started to go back up, I would sell a pre-determined percentage of my bitcoin.   And I could either completely remove it from my crypto holdings, or wait and if bitcoin fell back down a bit I could buy back in.  This way, I HOLD, DCA every paycheck, and I'm not trading on emotions.  I've already decided what I am going to do.  I won't be kicking myself for HODLing when it drops or rises.  
Well, we just passed the first milestone at 10K.  And I was feeling so good I was thinking, "it'll keep going up. just HODL onto this small percentage. If you sell you'll lose out on those potential moon gains."  So I went to bed.  When I woke up we were still above 10K, and  I decided to follow my pre-determined, emotion-free plan. I sodl that tiny percentage.  I'll hold on to the fiat for a while. If it bitcoin dips a certain percentage, I'll buy back in. If not, I have a mini 'Lambo' I've had my eyes on.
 I'm very bullish on bitcoins useful parameters.  I don't know if it will drop to 1k and be stable for a hundred years or reach a million by 2020. But I know that the characteristics that are inherent in bitcoin are valued by humans.

Isnt bitcoin a currency, which derives value from deing decentralized, finite etc. Which is made possible because it uses blockchain tech.
The reason 'experts' say that the blockchain is the real valie is because theu didnt create bitcoin and want to find a way to profit using the blockchain tech. Or am offbase on this.
