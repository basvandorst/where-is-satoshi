"I was in operations for years"..."When"..."20 years ago."
This conversation is had at least once a week here.

like being a doctor or any other skilled trade, coding requires you to continue to do it or your skills fade rapidly.  If you've been rockin the MS project and excel for 20 years you should not advise the proper way to write an application.

He was also a fairly good writer and seemed to convey ideas very well.  In the tech world those two skills lead to highly paid careers.

This is moronic.  They're proposing that goxcoin users give mtgox a interest free loan + trading fees(because who is going to sit on this shit?), so that mtgox can save face by repaying their btc balances early.  And what exactly do the owners/buyers/sellers of the goxcoin get?  That warm happy feeling of having a glimmer of a sliver of hope of actually getting re-payed the lost BTC?
They're asking for a bailout, plain and simple.  They came up with fancy wording to a community organized bailout.  Come up with a strong upside for the people lending gox their trust that they'll be paid back in real btc, than resubmit the proposal.

Man I don't want to hear it.  That's filer.  In my eyes When he got busted he was screaming at a wall with his sob story.

I own 0 btc or any other crypto currency. 
 I freakin love it. 
I love the technology behind it.  The possibilities. The challenges.  The land rush we are currently seeing.  Everything.  
I caught the tail end of the dot com boom in the professional world.  Watched the whole thing from my home pc.  Bitcoin feels like it's pre dotcom. Exciting time.

I find some of the regulations and the "IT WORKED FINE FOR 20 YEARS, NO CHANGE" thinking to be a pain.  I love the technology and resources I have access too.  Where some folks fight for new dl1xx kit I buy dl5xx and 9xx machines by the truck load.  It I mention resiliency and can tie it back its not even questioned.
I also love the "fast and reliable, not one or the other" thinking.

How do you know he still controls them? Last I checked they've never moved.
The guy invented something used by millions, and entirely convertible to real life goods.  Than walked away, while guarding his privacy during the implementation.  Sounds like the kind of guy to walk away from a few million in btc.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:49:58
Same.  We have some openstack products that we use for various things.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:38:30
If he really controls 1mil coins that'd be like adding 1/12th of USD to the economy.  That's not a good thing.  It'd be rapid inflation of value for each bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:15:15
The years of "mtgox is the default exchange" is how they have value.  It's the same reason you see restaurants and various other stores with "Under new management"  signs and not "we changed our name!" signs.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:15:05
Mark might just be the last of the great dotcom scammers.  Everything he's done up until now reeks of late 90s early 2000s internet scams.  It really fits with where bitcoin is in it's lifecycle.  It's right at the same place the internet and eCommerce were in 1998-2000.

Just so you know,  this type of time series data is the norm in other financial markets.  The fact only one person is doing it with btc seems odd.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:14:13
Know how many banks have actual money holding databases in the cloud? None.  Not a fucking one.
I work in financial services, Mainly trading platforms.  The security policies to prevent theft are there.  They've been there for years.  They're iso standards.  The problem is they're expensive, and hard to implement.  You're average coder in his spare bedroom with the camel book and a few aws instances isn't going to be able to implement them.  Until an honest to goodness exchange with real, experienced professionals and their own machines shows up on the scene this will happen again and again.

Proof even highly technical people can fall into using horrible platforms.  
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:25:11
If they're paying back users from user generated funds, they're giving Gox a cent.  Once those users are paid back they're no longer a creditor of gox.

He was saying not to sell them but destroy them.  Send them to a non functional address so they're unrecoverable.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:28:29
These big guys already have the backends and other platforms in place.  Its just a matter of adding a currency and some features.  
Source, I build and support financial information and transactions platforms.

My assumption is the guy has a career he enjoys.  With his intelligence that career probably pays pretty damn well.  
Bitcoin was his hobby, and Now it's his retirement.  If he goes cashing out now imagine the headlines....inventor cashes out, does he see bitcoin failing?!?!?!?

The more I read about mtgox\* the more I agree that Karpeles was just completely and totally incompetent.  He was a hell of a salesman but a shitty developer and businessman.  Everything i've read reeks of experiences I've had with salesmen turned IT pros.  The promises, the hiding, the almost cult warship, the obvious glaring flaws that are overlooked, the everything.  
\* I'm late to the mtgox party, but have been lightly following bitcoin.  
edit:  I was just reading [this]( business plan linked by two-bit idiot.  According to that "there are 40 employees responsible for the operations, maintenance and expansion" of mtgox.  If they really had 40 people looking after mtgox and never did a proper accounting they knew the books were cooked as fuck.

Why couldn't they seize all the coins?  To the US government they're just number on a drive or paper.  According to the US gov they are not legal tender.  
Also lets play the other side and the US gov sees value in the coins.  The government's of the world have never had a problem holding items as evidence.  Everything from firearms owned by people that witnessed a crime to property used in conjunction with a minor crime, a painting or car for example.

I've worked with many Japanese and many Asians over the years.  One thing is for damn sure, in tourist mode they all look pretty much the same to my American eyes.  
Not trying to be racist, it's simply that I didn't grow up around Asians so my brain does not register their features well.  I imagine it's the same for many non-Asians.

He imply he doesn't have in-house lawyers either.  He's moving millions of dollars/yen/* a month and doesn't have in house legal console?  Really?  I've worked for businesses that were doing 5 mil a year gross that had in-house accountants and lawyers.

most banks, trading firms and other financial industry types I've run into do not run any critical systems in a "cloud" of any form.  the regulatory hurdles and security hurdles simply don't justify the move from big iron to cloud.

Mark had 2 devs working for him?  TWO?  To run a multimillion dollar trading platform, he had TWO developers?  well shit, that explains a whole lot.  
// I work in IT for the financial sector.  Specifically on trading platforms and data delivery.  mtgox is a constant source of wtf.

That doesn't feel like the response of a guy that worked very hard to remain anonymous.
