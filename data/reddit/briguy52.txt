I'm pretty sure you just pay whatever it says when you click 'buy'. Whether you use transfer/credit card should not affect the price you pay.

I'm not Canadian, but I'll try to answer your other questions.
First off, not every platform accepts credit card. For example, Gemini (an exchange) only takes transfers whereas Coinbase (a brokerage) accepts both credit card and transfer. Of course, that costs them something, and so Coinbase charges you higher fees to make up for it. I believe Coinbase is $3USD for every trade, regardless of amount whereas I pay something like $0.25 on Gemini. That might make your 10 CAD/week idea impractical if you're set on credit card. I recommend just Googling up Gemini/Coinbase/and other brokerages/exchanges and seeing whether they accept credit card, and if so, what their fees are.
There's a lot of people that never take their Bitcoin out of an exchange/brokerage like Coinbase and Gemini. There's also a lot of people who insist that anyone who doesn't have a hardware wallet doesn't actually own their Bitcoin. I've been comfortable somewhere in the middle, buying Bitcoin on an exchange (e.g. Gemini) and then transferring out to a digital wallet (e.g. Electrum).

So a hardware wallet is a physical thing, kinda like a car key. It asks you to press a button whenever you send money (i.e. Remove money from your wallet). The big benefit seems to be that malware or hackers can't compromise your hardware wallet, since it's never connected to your computer or phone. 
For a software wallet, you login with username password. So it is possible that it could be hacked. It's still what I use, just because I'm still nowhere near owning an entire Bitcoin but I may switch some day.
Also, the main reason I got a software wallet (or any wallet) is that now you truly own your Bitcoin whereas anything on an exchange belongs to you, as long as they give it to you. Most times they do, but in certain scenarios (e.g. Pre August 1st) I couldn't withdraw anything from Coinbase because of the amount of traffic they had.

Good to know, will look into those. 
Also, is it common (or is it practical) to have more than one account other than for the reason that if one is compromised, you don't lose everything?

What would you suggest instead for a casual investor? Hardware wallets?
