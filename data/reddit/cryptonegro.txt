Dude the only reason you should buy more is because you have a fundamental understanding of what you're investing in. Stop coming to Reddit to ask total strangers what you should invest in and start doing your own research. The only way you will feel better is by knowing you made a sound investment in something you believe in. You can't expect me or someone else on reddit to give you belief in your investment. If you can't find a good reason to buy more on your own than don't. Maybe now is a good time to do some research into what the hell you are investing in

If your not happy in this market take some god dam personal responsibility for your own investment. Nobody forced you to buy and nobody is making you stay. Don't like the market leave.

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:54:05
You are by asking if you should buy or not. Nobody knows if you should buy or not so stop for a fucking �� and research your own dam investment
