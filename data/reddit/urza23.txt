Those who want regulation now are here just for "get rich quick" anyway and dont understand what bitcoin is about. I am much rather in live environment with ups and downs and yes also morally shady actions like BCash attacks,rather then dead "everything is sunshine" overregulated environment.
We need to find a way how to cope with these actions without state and regulations from bureaucrats. And crypto is amazing opportunity for that.

This is fantastic chart. Very clearly visible the effect what fees will get you in first block. So basically now everything above 20 sat/B is fine. So like 0.3 usd for typical transaction.

I hope the owner is using hardware wallet :)
Now when I think about it, hardware wallet might not be enough in this case, he needs to keep his identity anonymous

I am from CZ and I want to point out, that this is DESPITE politicians and regulatory offices - they are as ignorant here as everywhere else. Our minister of finance forbid selling bitcoins in postal offices, because he didn't know what bitcoin was and taught it is not good. It is only thanks to enterpreneurs and crypto enthusiasts, that are putting their skin in the game, that crypto is so successful here.

He obviously meant that he is growing trees over Cina mines so that their roots will disrupt their mining operation and force them to close it.
