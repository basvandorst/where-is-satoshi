I don't even understand what he is trying to argue. First he asks you how open market operations can remove dollars from existence (which you showed), then he stats that us bonds are something no one wants (which you proved wrong), finally he is just trying to argue that fed buying back bonds will wreck the rates. I don't know if he realizes what the demand is like for U.S bonds, I mean, the yields are at crazy low amounts.

Sorry I meant to say it was unlawful. I didn't mean to add the double negative. 
No for bitcoin cutting out the crap. The problem wasn't that the ownership wasn't crystal clear, it was that the banks didn't care. They didn't even bother reading the documents before they foreclosed the houses. It was a terrible thing. 
What are your bitcoin only businesses? I would like to see examples ones that actual started with no credit whatsoever. I won't deny that they are enjoying crazy good returns, but also keep in mind that many people enjoyed crazy good returns during the housing bubble. 
Finally, there maybe other models. However, I haven't found a better model compared to credit/debt.

Next month bubble pop? Unlikely, Top $1,000 before the eventual crash? Possible since it has hit over $1,200 already. Very difficult to predict when bubbles will pop, it is all dependent on up to what point people are willing to throw money into it. 
However, although many people on this subreddit will disagree with me, BitCoin is currently a bubble. The majority of BitCoins are currently not even being used for purchases, they are just simply either kept or bought and kept as an asset. People want BitCoins because they think it will keep going up and this demand causes BitCoins to keep going up. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy (due to limited supply).
 Once a good chunk of people decided enough is enough and start the sell off (no one will keep their bitcoin forever since there is no real economy behind it), the bubble will pop and the price will crash, hard.

That has nothing to do with easy money. That incident was simply because the banks and their law firms were forcing people to foreclose. The wikipedia article clearly states that it was "erroneous foreclosures and evictions" meaning it wasn't unlawful. The same exact thing could happen with bitcoins since even people who bought houses using cash and no credit, were evicted. Don't worry though, billion dollar settlements have been arising ever since. 
Also credit did not stop working for anyone not too big to fail. Credit is the reason why small businesses are alive. Credit is also why you can buy larger houses and better cars. Stop believing debt is always bad, it isn't. In fact, the majority of the times, debt is good and leads to economic growth.

Thank you, yeah that guy is stupid. Out of all the arguments he could have selected to talk against the BitCoin, he pulls the worst ones.

When it comes to currencies, people don't care about value, they care about stability.

I see where I went wrong. You are correct, it is an oxymoron.

How does that matter? The winner is still chosen by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The only difference is that the prize money is instead paid for by the Swedish Central Bank. Also before you try to discredit the nobel prize in economics by comparing it to the nobel peace prize, remember that unlike the actual science prizes, the nobel peace prize winner is selected by Norweigian Nobel Committee (a political committee).

Not to mention, who would actually place their bitcoins in banks? Doesn't everyone hold them in their wallets?
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:35:00
I doubt it. Since it is private companies and individuals accepting bitcoins, I think its just that they are just trying to create a market for all the bitcoins in mainland China. Nothing with politics or making statements, its all bout make money.

What about housing? How will that be paid for? Or should we just either all jumble up into gigantic apts owned by the super rich? Debt is good, debt combined with inflation actually helps a lot in lowering class differences. Debt is essentially using future earnings to pay for present needs/wants.

Where is the discussion thread you are talking about?

Still doesn't change the fact that no matter what, there will absolutely be a demand for USD as long as the United States is a country. As for BitCoin, there is no such guarantee and consequently it lacks the floor value other currencies enjoy. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:51:13
No it doesn't, the currency value is dependent on the demand and the supply of the currency. For example, the british pound technically has a higher value than the euro or the usd, but people care a whole lot more about the usd and the euro.

Physics and Chemistry is not the only thing that has improved our lives. Why do you think the U.S. was able to win the Cold War? It was a battle between two economic policies (communism vs. capitalism). A better understanding in economics results in many great improvements in the world. Better business decisions, better trade agreements, better decision making for the government (I know, I know, please don't laugh, it is still true). 
Watch this, it might be long, but it is an excellent talk.

It doesn't need to be banned to fail. If demand falls low enough, there will be a negative feedback causing an end to bitcoins. The difference between bitcoins and other assests/currencies is that other assets/currencies have a bottom which is higher than 0 to stop the negative feedback, bitcoin doesn't.

The winner is still selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences just like all of the other science prizes. The only difference is that the prize money is provided for by the Sveriges Riksbank.

cross post this to for a good debate

What, this makes no sense. U.S. is currently pro USD and the world  isn't anti USD... The world doesn't care if China or US likes bitcoin, the world only cares for what is best for them. If countries believe bitcoin is bad, then they won't use it, if they the believe it is good, they will use it.
