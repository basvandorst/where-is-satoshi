I see... Ok understand now (hopefully that was trolling)
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:45:13
On a pointless subreddit. Everyone here is expressing opinions. No need to be rude.

100 day moving average is a real thing. Think that if that breaks all the institutions will be leaving and btc will suffer a big dip.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:00:10
Damn brah... you were too true too fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:42:02
Brah stop telling yourself that... it’s getting sad. How would they even be able to do this... the market is too darn expensive for them to buy all those coins lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:43:04
Hahaha FUD?!?Was 10k FUD? LMAOOUUU

Banks usually try to hide loses or bad debt but ok. It isn’t like huge funds like Berkshire depend on this but Ok.

1. That’s great (if true). Never mind a nice uplifting story.
2. Something can’t be a store of value if it drops 30% in one day.
3. Bitcoin is a speculative asset. Congrats on your winnings!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:53:12
That’s great! I invested in bitcoin as well, and Ethereum.  Although I invested in it because it was going to get more overvalued. It tripled my 1k investment lol (seems small I know haha). I’ll agree with you that fiat currency sucks, the credit bubble is a thing etc. but that doesn’t explain why bitcoin shot up a couple thousand percentage points. No one knows where the bottom is. It could be much lower... telling people to buy without knowing the bottom seems irresponsible. Best of luck though
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:55:49
How much do you own?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:56:02
Explain how they could do this? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:54:09
Brah you didn’t get the comment. Don’t try to turn this around on him. Take the L.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:56:26
Aka Ethereum
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:54
Damn... troll a dude when he’s down lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:22:15
You can only create sell walls if you have coins. Hence they would have had to buy at more expensive prices (+11k) to sell at (9ish). Tell me how this makes money?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:24:17
Brah... HOW?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:30:42
True but they are extremely expensive and if I’m not wrong, leverage can’t be used in bitcoin futures.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:45:31
Sell!!! Bought at 6.2k and sold at 17k. Don’t lose all your money. If anything wait for it to really drop and buy more (if you believe in the technology)
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:02:06
Dude, what market analysis did you do to know that the bleeding would stop? How do you know that bitcoin won’t drop another 10% tomorrow or the next week. No one knows. Industries this young are volatile. If people had too much to lose and they got out, that’s not dumb in my book. Also, the tone of your messages sounds preachy. Not saying you are but it sounds like that.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:47:40
Dude turn some of those paper profits to real assets... at least pay off your mortgage and any credit card debt...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:26:13
Read something in economics called “sunk cost”. Once something has been paid it’s no longer part of your decision making, only the future. If you lost a bit... ok... don’t lose everything. Like I said find out the bottom and then buy. Heck, if you care, you’ll have more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:11:51
Why not sell and buy more later? Don’t lose all your purchasing power...
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:42:46
Bought at 6k sold at 17.8k. Tripled my money. No need to get burned to be present during the green.
P.S. kind of sadistic that you want to hear people losing money... guess you think that bitcoin only losing 15% was some kind of victory.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:29:23
1.  How is that the deep state?
2. Bitcoin was worth ~500 Billion dollars during the futures launch.... who has that much cash to manipulate. Not hedge funds 
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:01:34
Yeah 2% inflation a year. So $.02 a year per dollar.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:47:43
According to Wolf of Wall Street that’s how you survive lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:39
WHAT!?!?! Dude if you have more that 1k invested in this and you make less that 75k a year sell now!!! Who knows where the bottom is. You can always buy once it stops dropping...
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:10:53
For most people now, it is. Look at the frenzy over how many USD’s it’s worth. If people only care about the intrinsic value of bitcoin, why care about its USD value?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:17:27
Let me rephrase that. Don’t you think it was overvalued?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:15
If the price never goes back up there or if it takes years to do so... it’s actually pretty smart.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:53:45
WHOS HANDS!?!?! LELLL
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:43:39
1. Well then the profits of buying at $10-1000 would have to be shown in balance sheets. Don’t see that in their balance sheets.
2. Also, if this is true, then wouldn’t that mean that bitcoin wasn’t such a good investment? If it only went up because people were inflating it?
*Disclaimer: I bought at 6k*
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:09:32
*Face Palm* how’s that working out?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:28:03
Awesome then we are in agreement. Personally I believe in Eth more. There seems to be a more organized approach to improve the technology. Bitcoin seems to be tailcoating on the fact it was the first. But eh what do I know.

What SheepUk said. When the price goes up exponentially like now we reach mania... Seems like a lot of people buying now don’t believe in Bitcoin. If there isn’t a correction soon, eventually when it does happen it will be bad. When people see themselves lose 50%&lt;  of their money, those weak hands aren’t likely to reinvest...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:00
If there isn’t a correction soon, Bitcoin might actually turn into a bubble...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:51:32
Bubbles aren’t only for useless stuff. Look at dot.com. All those companies had value but the prices they reached were unsustainable and when the correction occurred it was bad...
