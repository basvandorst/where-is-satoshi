See I like this discussion. What I do is determined by the outcome of the ETF. If neither of my plans can work I have other investment options. This is just something I really want to an have wanted to invest in.

Very true. I ask for free advice but I still have my guard up. Thank you again for the advice and warning.

Thank you for your response and most importantly trying to look out for a fellow man. 
I do admit I am not the most knowledgeable about stocks. However I have made some good picks in the past. I only look to invest in long term growth. Day trading or being bullish just isn't what I am interested in. 
Honestly alot of what I have learned about stocks has been from the great communities on Reddit. I genuinely appreciate the feedback and discussion on subs like these. An people like you. Sturnly getting your point across with out coming across as an ass. Thank you sir.
I wanted to buy Bitcoin when it was below $100 but I just didn't. 
Now I'm looking for the best long-term investment I can make. If it dips to that low I will buy. But if the ETF passes would I be wise to buy as much as I can?
What is your opinion?

I agree that I don't even agree totally with my plan. I'm just not sure about the ETF going through. If it doesn't I'd like to buy actual Bitcoin an wait for it to rise up again. Then invest if a ETF comes around years later. Which I think it will. 
But if this one does go through I'd like to buy a ton of ETF stock because I think it will def rise along with Bitcoin. I've watch the coin for so long now but never invested. 
Currently I only have $2000 I'm willing to invest. I don't want a quick profit. I want to buy the most of what I can get an let it ride long term. 
So if I get the ETF for $10 a share, spending my $2000 I'll have 200 share. If I let it ride an it hits $1000 a share down the road I'll have $200,000 then. Long term.
Instead of buying two bitcoins an gaining only $1500 per coin when it goes through.
Pick it apart. Tell me what's right an wrong. I don't mind.
Edit because I'm on mobile an can't type right.
