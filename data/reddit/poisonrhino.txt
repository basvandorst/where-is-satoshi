I want to follow the price as the announcement happens so that I can see what happens. I am hoping that this will allow me to get a better understanding of what drives the currency.

Young Turks, a political movement that carried out the Armenian Genocide. Imagine a jew working for a foundation called 'The Nazis'.
She literally called herself better than any women that voted for Trump, because she disagrees with his political views. 
Go and watch the archived video of Cenk bashing Sarah Palin for calling blacks "not people". Then watch the apology, if you don't lose respect for these people then I am confused

TYT is garbage. The fact that Ana Kasparian works there is utterly disgusting. She lacks respect for not only her culture, but also Freedom Of Speech. She is the definition of bigotry.

No no no... The 21 club basically means that you own one millionth of the value that comes with 1 million bitcoins.

Yeah, I feel like I am hearing more and more people talk about bitcoin that otherwise would have no clue what it is. Media is grabbing peoples attention, and people are biting. 
The total market cap has rose $100 billion in a little over 1 month with no correction whatsoever.
Honestly I really wouldn't be surprised if at about $200 billion it stalls and corrects to $100 billion +/-. I will never try and time this market, but that is just the feeling I get in my gut.
Remember... It's impossible to predict future prices. If you succeed with your prediction it doesn't mean you are a genius. Winning the lottery doesn't mean you knew what numbers would hit.
