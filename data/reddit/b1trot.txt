anecdotal: my gf is interested in the idea of BTC, and interested that I'm so interested in it, but absolutely refuses to sit down at a computer and do the research that is required to understand the tech and eventually take the initial plunge. she'd just rather do other stuff.

This is the link that would come up every time I typed in "bitcoin" into my browser. This was when the price first hit $1000, and at the time I remember thinking how crazy that would be if this post was true. $1000 seemed like SO much money. I'm very happy I inadvertently kept running into this link because it was a great reminder of how things were in the very recent past. It's sometimes easy to forget.

it's quite obvious they saw how miserably the whole operation was going to go and called it off

awesome guy. did he give his opinion at all on all this forking nonsense? unless i'm mistaken, he seems to take the silent approach when it comes to discussing this sort of drama.

Good god that thing is horrifying. Ironically that's the thing that's going to be coming for btc hodlers

reddit bitcoiners don't take very well to newbies. which is very unfortunate for the entire community imo
