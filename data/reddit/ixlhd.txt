Got it working, Went into the bitcoin_conf file and changed dustrelayfee from 0.00 to 1.00. No idea how it was changed, all i done was restart the program cause it's been 2 days and i still haven't been able to transfer my bitcoin. Stuck in

I genuinely couldn't tell you how i got it that way but i went into the bitcoin_conf file and changed dustrelayfee from 0.00 to 1.00 (which seemed to fix it but after the restart i had to download everything from 2009 again), i am completely new to this whole thing.
All i want is for my bitcoin to transfer, i don't have a huge amount so i try as little  transfer fee as i can. 
My current Transaction fee: -0.00004224 BTC, i went by minimum allowed but this works out as barley anything. I can't abandon transactions for nearly two days and have no option to input more.

I got it sorted, restarted my computer, then had to re synchronize the program for some reason, 6 hour estimate left until it syncrhonizes.

Mine is taking forever, abandoned the last one (which was taking over a day) and started a new transaction.
For it to take 20 minutes it would cost 200(ish) euro.
so i lowered the transaction cost to the minimum and it's still unconfirmed for the last few hours. 
I will never use Bitcoin Knots again. 
(im new to the whole crypto thing so i'm making a lot of mistakes)
