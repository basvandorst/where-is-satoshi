Reaching general acceptance does have a need for higher usability and security is a huge concern. Obviously, butcoin/crypto can be real secure if you're really safe, but not everyone is and we need everyone to use it. :)

Just never sell, if you always wait for it to get higher... profit?

Sane person with an upvote reporting. lol Bitcoin has some of the most intelligent people and some of the most foolish. It is an interesting nerd investor clusterfuck in here.

Banking has reversible transactions and teams of fraud prevention. BitCoin has empathy at best. That is the difference. It also usually takes more than "instantly" to steal all of your fiat.
That said I love BitCoin and am sure people will come up with solutions to the problems it still faces.

1) get it right
2) go everywhere

Yeah, but it is still a heck of a lot more than nothing. You certainly know someone who had a charge back, canceled a transaction, or was a victim of identity theft and was in some way compensated. I know several.
I'm just saying. Neither is a perfect answer, there never will be a perfect answer.

TBH it may have, so what, it was probably to give them time to fix their code and be sure it was working great. Not all bug fixes are fixed *properly* overnight!
