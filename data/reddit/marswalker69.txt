Can you imagine? Buying ALL btc for just 210k? Theoretically ofcourse. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:58:28
Quasi repost from r/BitcoinNL.
After trial for growing weed and leeching electricity illegally a guy gets his illegally seized bitcoins returned. But only part of it, to the sum of the same fiat value of when it was seized. Roughly €19k. If he got them all back at current rates he would have recieved €4.000.000
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:57:55
I would not flash about your or her earnings in BTC on FB.

Finally! Now drop till $3k!!!

Is this not simply inflation on purpose?
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:30:24
..is not always a bad move. You just have to **hodl** onto the knife, until the **bleeding** stops and the wound heals and **grows**. But it will be painfull ofcourse waiting it out.

I cant wait! Hopefully drop hard as shit. Like 60%

 To put it simply, a hash function is just a mathematical algorithm that takes an input and turns it into an output. For example, suppose we have an algorithm which just adds all the digits in the input string together. If our input is 1234 we would get an output of 10.
1234 ==&gt; 10 
Simple enough. However, there are certain properties of really good hash functions that make them suitable to use in cryptography. Keep these properties in mind as they are vital to the operation of the Bitcoin protocol.
It should be very easy to compute an output for any given input, however it should be impossible (given current knowledge of mathematics and the state of computers) to compute the input for a given output even while knowing the mathematical algorithm. Consider, in the above example we can easily compute an output of 10 given the input of 1234, however going in reverse isn’t as easy. In this case there are many possible inputs that could add up to 10 (55, 136, 7111, etc). However, given the simplicity of our function one could still figure out the input relatively easily. Some cryptographic hash functions, on the other hand, are said to be unbreakable by even quantum computers.
Unlike our example, each potential output should map to only one input. If a two different inputs can produce the same output this is called a hash collision. Good cryptographic hash algorithms are resistant to such collisions.
 A hash function should be able to take inputs of variable size and turn them into outputs of a fixed size. For example:hello ==&gt; 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 goodbye ==&gt; 82e35a63ceba37e9646434c5dd412ea577147f1e4a41ccde1614253187e3dbf9
The output should be the same length regardless of whether the input has 10 characters or 10 thousand characters.
A tiny change in the input should produce an entirely different output that in no way relates to the original input. Example:hello world ==&gt; 98c615784ccb5fe5936fbc0cbe9dfdb408d92f0f Hello World ==&gt; a830d7beb04eb7549ce990fb7dc962e499a27230 Hello World! ==&gt; 8476ee4631b9b30ac2754b0ee0c47e161d3f724c Hello, World ==&gt; 6782893f9a818abc3da35d745a803d72a660c9f5
Bitcoin makes heavy use of the cryptographic hash function SHA256, which stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit. Incidentally, the SHA algorithms were originally developed by the NSA. You might wonder how we can trust something that came from the NSA. That’s certainly cause to be suspicious, however, the algorithms are part of the public domain and have been vetted and analyzed by cryptographers who know what they’re doing. The consensus is that they are secure.
Greetings, the internet.

Right. But thats still (if even ... ) a long time from now.

Just hodl. Bitcoin has always climbed back up and beyond eventually. Trust us! ☺️����

Hardware wallet. Nano ledger S. Easy to use. Safe AF.

I heard of bitcoin back then. I said to myself: Pff, what a pointless idea. This will never take off.
Changed my mind in march 2017. Better late than never!

Start by googling how to buy one. Like a Nano S or Trezor.  The manual off said device will help you further. Its like any transaction from adress A to B.

I will research autobuy from your website and try to stop smoking! Autobuy! Autobuy! Autobuy!
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:34:14
You should have HODL. You re unknowingly assuming that the price will never be back at what you bought it for by selling for a loss. Selling low only makes sense of you're sure btc is gonna die. Patience. HODL.
