The concern OP raised is a legitimate issue as to the minimum value a channel must transact over its lifetime to be useful relative to the transaction fees.  Similarly, the risk of channels being opened in a different fee environment than when closed, and thus becoming worthless.
CPFP is related but irrelevant to the discussion.

Thanks for writing this up.  Though there was enough information in the repo for experienced users to run tor facing nodes I struggled trying to get it running.  This guide looks great.

Banks are holding onto long term bonds beyond any apparent reason. Indicating it is one of the last asset classes viewed as reasonably safe or productive over the long term. To the Bitcoin maximalist this suggests that a new asset with different fundamentals might prove to be valuable in the eye of institutional investors.

I think the article addressed these concerns.  Transactions would remain irreversible except for those in this new address type.  In comparison, this sounds simpler for users/merchants than even RBF.  
This preserves the trustless nature of Bitcoin while enabling on-chain security better than that offered by third parties (2 of 3 multisig with a delayed cancellable signing - Eg. Coinbase)

Certainly changes the cost/benefit of making an attempt at theft.
@_date: 2016-08-13 01:00:42
One major difference I just noticed is that copay must rely on the bitcore full node software, whereas Electrum relies on bitcoin-core.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:06:36
Still an improvement.  Currently there is no friction for theft.

No scientific endeavor or major project could be undertaken without some sort of credit system.
Whether that is people coming together to fund something for equity, or assessing risk and charging interest accordingly. The amount of wealth a single person can put towards a goal is minuscule compared to the scale necessary for interesting progress.
As such I think solutions like this are interesting and worthwhile.

1. Settling transactions aren't formed/broadcast until time of settlement.  As such you can choose an appropriate fee without invoking any transaction replacement.
2. The post is about opening a channel with low value, and over time the on-chain fees dwarfing the value of the channel. CPFP cannot help this.

Does anyone here own any Onecoins?  Whats it like.  I'm curious what its like.  Can you trade them? Send them to people?
What is it thats sucking people in?
I might sign up just to see what they are pumping.

Credit can be a useful tool.  Maybe not credit cards per-say. 
Decentralized credit is a useful and needed tool.

How do you go about rejoining the multisig wallet?  I tried this in the following way which failed:
I found the invite code and tried it again but got an error such as "This key already belongs to this wallet."
If there is a way to do it without the invite code it is very not intuitive.
It might be worth posting the process for this type of recovery for people searching in the future.

I have all the private keys which made the multisig address.  The funds aren't lost, they are just obstructed by UI.
I need someone to help me manually sign a transaction, and navigate HD wallet key derivations. Not impossible, and possibly fun for the right person.
Edit: I added that info in the second paragraph, though, so its clear as you read.
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:07:22
You posed yesterday too! Is there an opinion behind the comments, or just poking fun at me. (deservedly)
I have never heard any negative arguments regarding multisig.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:16:27
I would be happy to do this if it would work.
Unfortunately Copay doesn't allow one to sign payment proposals with arbitrary wallets.  It's rather intuitive, and a bit hard to explain, but if the Copay instance hasn't "joined" the multisig wallet (using Copay magic) it cannot sign payment proposals - even if it is using the same seed/keys/address.
In addition I can only "join" the multisig wallet as one of the principal Trezors (due to the nature of my backups), so the UI is preventing me (or you) from signing as any additional seeds.
A workaround to this would be great!
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:40:05
I think we agree.  The tech is awesome (really, still mind blowingly cool), the UI needs work.
And it worked great. See above.
@_date: 2016-09-07 16:07:45
I disagree pretty much entirely. Though you may just be trolling...
Most everything we interact with on a daily basis is incredibly complex.  A car, a computer, ourselves.  Multisig is an immutable contract enforced by the blockchain and is an incredible piece of technology enabling immutable, autonomous execution of the contract.
UIs are still developing.  The tech worked perfectly here, the UI was just a bit narrow.  I love multisig (and HD wallets and Trezors).

Hey thanks for the comment! I'd love some help.
So I have tried that but unfortunately, due to my misunderstanding, I only have a backup of the Copay metadata from a single copayer.  As a result when importing it on another computer I can only sign the transaction with the primary Trezor.
If there is a workaround for this it is what I am looking for.
Creating a normal Copay wallet with any of the Trezors, similarly does not give me access to the "payment proposal".
Edit: This was a "copay dev" with a suggestion. Strange.
@_date: 2016-09-07 16:08:10
And indeed they did!

I've actually crafted a transaction using Electrum spending the coins.  Just need to sign it.  
So in other words, starting from xpubs I can generate the appropriate addresses etc and make transactions.  I just need a way to sign them.
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:26:07
I mean to say I don't plan on reusing them after I extract my coins as safely as possible!
@_date: 2016-09-06 01:21:25
Thanks so much, I was looking for something like this... This is a great start!
I know the extended public keys corresponding to the wallet. Any pointers on how to turn a private key into an xpub? With that I think I could find the right key.
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:18:47
I spent a considerable amount of time working with both Copay and Electrum and can confidently say that Electrum is the superior cold storage solution wallet.
**Electrum pros**:
- Multisig transactions can be signed and multisig wallets can be generated with a single transaction.
- Coin control
- Intuitive behavior
- Electrum server depends on bitcoin core
**Copay pros**: Copay is a good solution if you are collaborating with others (each person maintains a single key) or if you want to control a wallet with a single key.  It is built for simplicity.
 - Multisig transactions appear for peers magically (no usb drives)
 - Can multisig between a PC and a phone for 2FA transaction signing
 - (con) Bitcore Wallet Service depends on the bitcore implementation of bitcoin (con for me)
 - (con) Requires more than the original seeds to restore access to a multisig wallet
I set out searching for a wallet which would let me do multisig with trezor keys to implement a cold storage solution.  For this purpose Copay will **not** work at all.  Electrum is the only choice.  If you don't need this functionality and want to do multisig between parties or multisig between devices then Copay would work great.
As a note: Copay can only interact with Trezor through the Chrome app and Trezor Bridge while Electrum has native support. Copay also has more trouble when offline while Electrum remains functional but doesn't update balances.

Thats awesome. Its to late for me to test to verify this works but maybe it will help someone in the future.  Thanks for posting.
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:10:00
I'll play with this tonight.
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:12:57
Unfortunately no.  This was my misunderstanding.
In order for Copay to maintain a "simple" user interface, flexibility is significantly constrained. 
A copay "machine" can only join as a single Copayer.  The backup of the multisig wallet metadata also specifies the specific Copayer who made the backup, so any restorations of the Copay wallet metadata on other machines can only sign as the primary copayer.
Also, creating an additional wallet with the same trezor seed does not allow you to interact with "payment proposals" as they call them (multisig transactions sent magically through the bws api), sign arbitrary transactions, or interact with any multisig wallets your seed generated.  You must receive the multisig transaction through the app and sign it from one of the multisig wallets.
This caught me off guard and is why I am asking for help!  Thanks!
