It works.. I'd say just try it if you have a use for it.. it takes like 5 min to sign up  - they let you do like $2k/yr in transactions before requiring ID verification. The slowest part of the process is waiting for the btc deposit to confirm :p

There aren't any requirements.. or at least none that have officially been used to close any exchange's bank accounts.. they just close them without explanation or attempt to negotiate. 
The requirement seems to be that you don't run a bitcoin exchange :p

The fees are still a huge problem.. doesn't coinbase charge 1% on their non-exchange platform? That's already more than transferwise charge without even considering the fees to cash out on the other side.
There's also the issue that if you want to send money to a foreign country using bitcoin then it's the recipient that also has to open a bitcoin exchange account and go through kyc/aml that they might not be willing to do just so someone can pay them. 
And finally transferwise doesn't even do aml/kyc for most of their customers (or rather it's a very light kyc).. you can basically just sign up and send money immediately after a 5min phone call where they ask you some questions.. they do ask for passport scans eventually if you send a lot of money, but probably 99% of their customers have never been asked.

yea.. i'm not really sure why bitcoin atms haven't gone more down this route.. it'd be much safer since there'd be no cash to steal out of the atm so it doesn't need to be made out of strong metal and also no maintenance. If you do pin verification i guess its' no less secure than a normal atm.

You can be your own bank if you want.. it's just that probably not even 275k people in the world will ever want too. Most of them will be using some kind of intermediary.


basically they would only use it if they didn't have a more cost effective means of settlement.. in the current world inter bank payments are not always settled on fedwire.. the banks maintain accounts with each other and settle through those.. only when more trade flows one way than the other do they need to settle through fedwire or rtgs.. but maybe not even then.. they could settle up by selling other securities settled through some other system to refill their fiat settlement account at a partner bank.
probably in the cryptocurrency world there will be other mechanisms such as sidechains and lightning networks instead of just having hubs maintaining accounts with each other (although that will probably still happen too).

There are some exchanges that allow wire transfer purchases without showing ID.. I assume for the reasons you say.. they get the name and address along with the wire. National bank transfers on the other hand do not generally give the address and sometimes not even the full name of the sender.
Some exchanges that allow purchases using a wire transfer without scanning ID are kraken.com and cointrader.net and allegedly btc-e.com. Kraken's level2 verification which allows up to 2k/day or $10k/month (iirc) via wire transfer only requires self declared name and address on their form (no scans).  also has these limits so I guess there may be some regulatory reason for those amounts.
Exchanges mostly do require a government ID and residency proof (ie, a bill, bank statement etc) however coinbase has a system where they can verify you using credit reference agencies and by giving them your online banking password so they can check your name there (I think.. this may have changed). I think circle does something like this too although they sometimes ask for id scans as well.
IMO passport and utility bill scans are fairly useless for verification given that you can easily obtain both fake IDs and fake utility bills on the darknet market sites and also people skilled in the use of photoshop can probably just make their own.. I suppose that's why they started requiring id selfies along with the IDs.. however there's probably not much stopping someone from getting a fake id and then taking a selfie with it.. Perhaps the kyc teams at bitcoin exchanges are getting better at detecting fakes but I dunno.. there's only so much you can do and they're taking customers from all over so there must be an enormous variation in types of ID and address proofs that they're asked to check.. probably if you submitted 10 applications at least one of them would get approved.

I think coinbase and circle are basically the only exchanges with US banking access. Maybe ITBit will work as well.. really though I don't understand why you would want to do this.. Just use a SEPA account with kraken and it will be faster and cheaper. US ACH is not instant.. it's actually slower than SEPA.. it only works instantly on coinbase if you also link a credit card.

It will still work fine as a settlement system between payment processors though. There aren't 1m banks in the world. The fedwire and RTGS systems support the entire USD and GBP currencies using just a few hundred thousand transactions per day. 
The fact is that probably not even 275k people actually use bitcoin regularly today and it's entirely possible that they never will - not because they won't adopt bitcoin but because in order for bitcoin to go mainstream they will be using payment processors that hide it and do net settlement anyway. The market for people who actually want to use "bare metal" bitcoin is already saturated and won't be significantly expanding. The next phase depends on new overlay networks that are yet to be constructed.

In europe you don't really "link" your account to bitcoin exchanges.. you just send money to their IBAN account. If you can open an account on coinbase in germany (I think you may fall down at this step;  as germany is not a supported country) and your bank allows sending funds to their bank account then it will work.. it's possible that your bank will stop the transfer and call you about possible fraud.. if you explain to them that you did intend to send the transfer then perhaps they will allow it to proceed. 
You could try using  or  instead of coinbase and those will probably work.

You have many keys in your wallet.. some of them were used previously and would never be used again. If someone sends money to one of these old keys then it will be used again, combined with your other newer funded keys. When the old key is used with a new key in the same transaction it shows that they both belong to you. If someone knew that the old key belonged to you they now know that the new key also belongs to you.

I'd say deposit them to another exchange, perhaps btc-e and then withdraw them later. That way coinbase can't see what you're doing later and from their perspective you didn't do anything wrong, just sent the coins to another exchange. 
There probably aren't any bitcoin mixers that offer real anonymity.. either they're fronted by cloudflare or probably run by people spying on you and there's no way to know.. maybe run your coins through one if you want but realize that you are probably not protected from state surveillance by doing so.

Probably not really. I'm fairly sure there are no bitcoin exchanges there. If the intended recipient was willing to do kyc and open a bitcoin exchange account they would be able to wtihdraw from any of the main bitcoin exchanges (eg bitstamp) to their bank in St Lucia via wire transfer (generally bitcoin exchanges only allow you to withdraw to your own bank account, not send to someone else's so this does require the recipient to get an exchange account and do kyc - which they might not be willing to do). 
It's unlikely though that the fees would be lower than you simply wiring the money directly from your own account to them anyway. I would however expect the fees for doing a direct wire transfer to be less than 20% unless it's a fairly small amount.

The fees for using a credit card are 5% iirc.. the good part is that it bills in GBP (rather than USD like circle or EUR like cex.io) so no fx fees and doesn't trigger a cash advance fee.. the bad is that their market is not very liquid and trades at a premium to other markets;
Right now for buying the lowest ask is about 2.5% over bitstamp.. so if you take that 2.5% and the 5% card fee you're paying around 7.5% in fees to acquire your bitcoins. It's still more expensive than localbitcoins. 
tldr; If you want to buy a small amount of btc and don't want to use p2p exchanges like localbitcoins and only have a UK bank account and can't get a circle.com account (because even with the fx fees it's probably slightly cheaper) it may be your best worst option :)

The 80-page case report contained some IBAN numbers to known exchanges like Kraken.com , Bitcoin.de or Bitstamp.net belong. Must be reported, when bank customers received transfers of over € 1,000 of these IBAN numbers. In addition, should be tested if payments over € 10,500 per year, which are not salaries, could come from Bitcoin exchanges. 
So it sounds like any significant wire transfers from (and possible to?) known bitcoin exchanges will be automatically reported to europol.

Presumably they intend to spend them eventually. If they intend to make small payments in the future then I think it does make sense to have more small input transactions available.. imagine they suddenly need to make a bunch of small payments one after another.. if all their funds are all in large transactions then they have to wait for each payment to confirm and get the change back before spending the next one. With more inputs available they can just use a different one for each payment.

You can get an idea how many keys own how much BTC by looking at this [report]( It's quite hard to answer your question though.. I think the businessinsider article probably overestimates the number of bitcoin users.. or at least it must be being quite generous and including everyone who ever owned any amount of btc but maybe doesn't currently own any at all. 
It is easy to answer similar questions though.. for example if you owned 0.1BTC in one key you currently have somewhere near the 600,782 richest key.
If you have a key with at least 0.001 BTC it is around the 1,170,000th richest key.
If you have a key with a full 1 BTC in it, it's at least the 321,118th richest key.

I understand that.. however it obviously only works with exchanges that have partnered with you. If the accounts were issued in the name of the customer then they could directly transfer funds to ANY bitcoin exchange and other services such as currencyfair or other fx and e-money sites that refuse to deal with 3rd party transfers such as yours.
I realize there probably isn't much you can do about this limitation.. but it's something potential customers should be made aware of before they end up with their funds frozen on some other site.

Many tried but were cut off by their banks. There are several UK companies operating exchanges at the moment;
coinfloor.co.uk, coincorner.com, netagio.com, mimex.net, ibwt.co.uk
however without UK banking access they aren't really prospering.. they have nothing to offer the domestic UK market and in europe they compete with established exchanges like bitstamp (which is actually a UK company, although run from and banked in Slovenia) and kraken.com. 
mimex currently does have a UK banking arrangement however it is too early to tell if this will last.
I'm not sure how interesting the exchange startup thing is anymore anyway.. perhaps bitcoins startups should focus on trying to find other business models that don't involve converting bitcoin to/from fiat.. there's blockchain.info for instance and maybe maidsafe.. also both UK companies. 
People will always want to trade on the most liquid exchanges.. if the UK banks ever do relax their stance on bank accounts for exchanges it's a certainty that bitstamp and kraken (and probably coinbase/circle/whoever else) would open accounts here too.

I used them when they had UK FP deposits.. now that it's a wire transfer to Poland I don't really see the point.. there are other more liquid markets available via SWIFT bank transfer; anxbtc.com, btc-e.com or kraken.com all of which have GBP orderbooks.. or you could just wire the money in GBP to bitstamp and let them convert it to USD which they do very cheaply and trade there in USD instead.
coincorner.com (based in the isle of man) now supports credit/debit card deposits in GBP however there is a 5% deposit fee and their market is also very illiquid.. nevertheless If you want to buy a small amount quickly this is an option as deposits are instant and there is no cash fee or fx fee like with circle.com.
It's worth considering localbitcoins as well.. currently there are a few offers around a 2.5% premium over the average market price which isn't really that bad when you consider possible deposit and trading fees as well as the cost of bank wire itself.

My understanding is that sofort is basically a regular international swift wire transfer.. the difference is that sofort gets to MITM the browser connection to your bank - that way they can make sure you really sent the payment and then they notify the receiver (in this case Yacuna) so that you are credited before the swift transfer actually arrives. It doesn't save any money (might even cost more as I think sofort adds their own fees) but it is instant instead of 3-5 days.

There's no way for anyone to know if someone has &gt;50% of the mining power unless they tell you. The mining percentage graphs are all based on volontarily disclosed information or guesses based on leaked clues that could be suppressed if the miner wanted and was slightly careful.
Mining is already very centralized.. at any one time the top two pools probably have &gt;50%.. we're talking about 3 or 4 people - how much more centralized do you need to get before bitcoin collapses? 2 people or does it have to be one individual guy? 
Keep in mind that govt intelligence is quite capable of kidnapping / replacing all the pool operators at a moment's notice without anyone knowing about it.. the whole mining thing is well.. sortof smoke and mirrors.. however it does create a lot of plausible deniability where governments can pretend that they can't do anything about it.
I think the main thing that mining provides is a way to transition between different miners or pools leading the network.. they can come and go and it doesn't require a messy power struggle each time.

You can buy BTC using a credit card on coincorner.com - requires verification and there's a 5% fee, however it is instant and bills in GBP so you won't get stung for cash and fx fees like with circle. It also requires verification with ID and address scans.
localbitcoins.com right now there are offers 2-3% over the average. Works with faster payments and is usually very fast. Considering the hassle of using other methods if you value your time this is probably the way to go unless you're buying a very large amount. Have a photo of your debit card on hand to upload in case the seller asks to see it.. you can block out the 16 digit cc number they just want to see that the name on the card is the same as what shows on their bank statement. After you've done a few trades with trusted people who will verify your name they usually don't ask anymore.
If you are buying a larger amount ( &gt;2000GBP? ) then just send an international wire transfer to bitstamp/coinfloor/coincorner/kraken/anxbtc/btc-e etc. It costs around £10 to send a SWIFT transfer from most banks.. if you send the money as GBP your bank won't charge any other fees (don't use SEPA or you will get charged for conversion to EUR).

You're only allowed to link a certain number of cards or bank accounts.. I think it's somewhere between 3 or 5 they stop letting you add any more. It doesn't matter if you delete them afterwards.. once you exceed the limit the only way forward is to email support and ask them to increase your limit.

It was quite recent although when it happened it initially seemed like it was a permanent change and they just wouldn't deal with banks anymore.. however I guess they changed their minds.. they still had working deposit/withdrawal it was just that you had to use one of their e-currency wallet partners like okpay/egopay/perfect money instead of direct banking transfers. You can/could also withdraw direct to a debit/credit card as well..

Bitstamp like all bitcoin exchanges is fronted by a MITM DDOS protection service [incapsula](
They also send emails which are probably intercepted and you probably registered with a gmail address anyway so the NSA can just search through those to find out how much BTC you bought and where you sent it.

Nodes need to be able to leave and join the network. If they're not always there (noone has 100% uptime -and new nodes that never witnessed earlier transactions need to join in order for the network to grow) they can't know what timestamp is lower.. it's just whatever other nodes told them and they can't be trusted. Even if they were there the whole time the only timestamp they can trust is their own observation time which is different for every node depending on how close they are to the transaction origination.

Correct. As long as you sell less than $75k per year of goods then you don't need to register for GST and don't need to collect it from the buyer or remit it to the government. It's the same as personal ebay or yard sale sales.

You can buy smallish amounts on [localbitcoins]( or [bitbargain]( via UK bank transfer. The localbitcoins sellers usually only ask for a scan or mobile phone snapshot of your debit card with the number blocked out just as a sort of proof that you own the account that's paying them (the names have to match what shows up on their statement from the bank transfer) so it's not that intrusive. I'm not sure what proofs might be asked for on bitbargain but if you're buying £1 and they ask for something you're not comfortable with sending after you've already paid them then you can probably walk away from the £1 without too much worry. On localbitcoins you can chat to the seller before paying them too so you can negotiate in advance what proof if any is needed.

They give you the use of a dedicated IBAN, however the accounts are all in the name of [Global Transaction Services LLC]( who provide the service through mBank/BRE bank in Poland. 
The fact that the account is not in your own name makes it impossible to withdraw money from cryptocapital to another btc exchange or any other financial service that requires the payment to come from your own account. It's not useless, but the account name is a significant limitation on what could be a very useful service.

Cold storage sweeping can skew the numbers, no doubt - but people generally deposit to unique deposit addresses, so at least for some time they are represented (if they're actively depositing/withdrawing).. 
I also think it's unlikely there are millions of users hiding behind exchange cold storage addresses that don't even have at least 0.01BTC in one of their own keys.
More active bitcoin users are likely to hold several keys larger than 0.01BTC so if anything I think the number of active users is likely less than the number of 0.01BTC keys rather than more. The average number of inputs to a transaction is somewhere around 3 - so perhaps you can even divide the 1m / 3 = 300k which is similar to the number of bitcointalk users.

Sounds complicated enough without introducing BTC into the negotiations.. the localbitcoins ARS price per BTC is currently 4116 ARS per BTC.. in dollars that's $481 while the actual dollar price is around $347 so your 50000 pesos would only buy back $4215 worth of BTC going via bitcoin.. how would that compare to using the same blue dollar exchangers you used on the way in?

The government tax office starts requiring btc transaction ids be filed for each company showing inbound and outbound payments and justification for them (ie, salary).. so unless the company is prepared to lie and classify salary payments as something else it'll be even harder to avoid than now since all the payments are verifyable in the blockchain.

Australian individuals only need to register for GST if their turnover is &gt;$75k/year.. that's probably enough for most non-pro traders.
Foreign companies should be able to sell BTC to Australians on an Australian exchange without charging VAT so as long as one party to the transaction is non-Australian there's no problem.
Australian exchanges should be able to avoid trouble as long as they arrange their accounting such that it's always the trade counterparty that is selling and not the exchange and they can keep their traders out of trouble by setting fiat limits to keep everyone under the $75k threshold. Pro traders can trade on Aussie exchanges using a foreign shell company.

I would recommend [kraken]( for euros.. they have the largest EUR denominated order book and their bank (fidor in germany) processes SEPA transfers in &lt;24hrs usually. There is no fee for SEPA deposits (5EUR fixed fee for SWIFT EUR transfer) and a minimum deposit of 50EUR.

I doubt bitcoin would be of much use here.. firstly there probably isn't any bitcoin exchange in the Dominican Republic so they'd have to send a wire transfer offshore.. secondly bitcoin exchanges do not allow you to pay them from an account that isn't yours, so whoever owes you the money would have to open their own account at the bitcoin exchange to buy BTC to send to you.. this seems like a lot of cooperation to expect from someone you've just sued :p
If you can get them to pay you in cash you could try and find a localbitcoins dealer.. that would probably work however the disadvantageous rate of exchange you might receive from the dealer could well exceed whatever fees the banks or western union would charge to send the cash back.

Good question.. Mostly, the answer is that you can't! The options are you can make the property owned by a centralized custodian that then makes it available to whomever the blockchain currently designates.. or the other option is you can build DRM controls into the property that understand how to read the blockchain and refuse to work for anyone but the proper current owner. 
In the first case, why not just have the custodian maintain the owner registry? Since the entire scheme relies on the custodian being honest and not being overiden by the courts there is very limited benefit in storing the ownership information on the blockchain rather than in an excell spreadsheet. The risidual benefits that still exist are that possibly there will be tools that make it easier to manage such a scheme than an excell spreadsheet (although not yet) and that it's automatically made public on the internet (although regularly published excell spreadsheets would pretty much cover this too).
In the second case.. well that's perhaps more promising.. it may work, but people will still find ways to circumvent the DRM and 'steal' the smart property.. allowing it to be useful to people who aren't the owner according to the blockchain.

I doubt any of these methods are really 'anonymous' from a state security aparatus 
perspective.. but anyway;
you could sell btc for [moneypaks]( on [lbc]( or forums and use them to reload a prepaid card.
btc-e.com can send money to visa/mastercard including reloadable prepaid cards. ~5% fee.
[polish prepaid cards]( have their own IBAN/SWIFT bank account information so you can add money to them from any exchange that supports SEPA or SWIFT transfers. You can use any name.. there is no verfication.. basically an anonymous bank account but quite limited. You could sell BTC on localbitcoins for SEPA/SWIFT transfer to the card and then withdraw it from an ATM. These cards are reloadable multiple times but have a low yearly transaction volume limit so you might need to get a few different ones.
There are some [prepaid cards]( that can be bought and loaded directly from btc. I believe these can be used up to a low dollar amount without verification.

You can compare the [dogechain keycounts]( to the [bitcoin blockchain]( 
It seems possible that dogecoin could be more widely held than bitcoin in 3 months time. Even [litecoin]( is catching up fast since Nov.
The merchant adoption thing is also not so important.. all cryptos follow the concept of irreversible payment, so a wallet can easily debit one coin and pay out another in the same manner that bitpay takes in bitcoin and pays out USD. I imagine this could take the form of a firefox/chrome plugin that automatically enhances a bitpay checkout page with pay-through dogecoin/litecoin addresses that are automatically exchanged for a bitcoin payment to the original bitpay address.
What matters for price appreciation is what currency people save in (ie, consumer adoption).. the exchange friction is minimal and won't be the determining factor in where people save. Bitcoin does have ETFs, currency code allocation that are further along (maybe?) which could potentially channel a lot of savings from wallst funds though. Of course, if bitcoin is to succeed not because of it's users but because of wallst that would be rather ironic.

You can hardly argue that having to replace existing systems doesn't create an opportunity for new entrants.. maybe little.. maybe a lot.. but it's certain to create some opportunities that wouldn't otherwise have existed.. it may even happen to some degree in the retail POS space.. you can buy a bunch of new terminals from whoever supplied your last ones.. or maybe get one from someone else.. possibly one that also supports bitcoin? While coinkite does not currently support processing visa/mastercards I believe the hardware is capable..  once they have reached an agreement with a processor it will be turned on and their sales people can approach merchants as a valid replacement alternative. Another option people will probably have to consider is a software / ipad type solution which again will make it easy to integrate bitcoin. Imagine you're a bitcoin POS salesdroid.. would you rather your potential customer is just about to replace their POS system, or not? It seems pretty obvious.

It's difficult to make comparisons.. consider what happens if dogecoin's mcap were to increase by 10x.. bringing it to around the level of litecoin. The first dogecoin halving event happens in 9 days time when the supply of dogecoins will be reduced from the current 720000000 per day to 360000000 per day. This supply shock could possibly trigger such a revaluation. Obviously people are anticipating this since it is well known so maybe it won't.
At 10x the 47600 (10 btc proportional) level might be more representative (there are currently 57000 such keys) - so there would be potantially 57000 keys with as much buying power as the 270000 keys with one bitcoin.
It's also worth considering that bitcoin hasn't been worth as much as it is for very long.. there were still 220000 1 btc keys back in october when the btc mcap was around 1/4th what it is today. The mcap depends more on 'strong hands' with a belif in a higher mcap than on the number of users, but as dogecoin continues to grow I expect more serious people will enter the market altering the overall psychology of the coin. Right now people are mostly not taking it seriously but that could change suddenly. People used to tip 100btc in bitcoin back in 2009 too.

Back in the old days mobiles didn't have SIM cards (PCS/CDMA and old analog phones).. It wasn't really a good thing as it meant you had to beg the telco to move your number to another device.
I think it's actually more likely that SIMs will be used to store bitcoin private keys.. storing a private key on the phone's memory is actually quite undesirable from a security perspective. There's no reason that the existing GSM credentials couldn't just be stored on the phone too other than it's considered too insecure.

I have two coinbase accounts and I don't have a US bank account, so have no way to fund them.. I just created them to check it out. Similarly I have accounts with several chinese exchanges. I had two mtgox accounts.. and several blockchain.info accounts (for different phones, tablets etc).. I'm not sure how typical I am, but I suspect I'm not the only one who signs up for each new bitcoin service.. sometimes multiple times.

I like what Zippcard and Mardica have done.. it's quite clever because now that there are several companies selling BTC for visa/mastercard it's quite hard to see why a new 'challenger card network' shouldn't also do so.. I had actually thought of using a similar scheme.. just using a regular prepaid card mastercard company but offering a discount to bitcoin exchanges who used the prepaid card company as an acquirer for cards that were owned by the prepaid card company. Then the exchanges would advertise a cheaper deposit option through the prepaid company and their customers would all go open accounts there.
I think that eventually UK banks will start allowing some bitcoin exchanges to have accounts.. and it will be easy to make up reasons as to why previous exchanges were cut off.. but really I don't believe it.. they were cut off by some unspoken policy that will later be overturned and that's all there is to it. The only question is; has it been overturned yet? If not I do still expect Santander to cut off Mardica with a no explanation account closure letter.

It's definitely no. It's a SWIFT wire to Luxembourg.. the only saving is that you don't pay your bank's FX fees to convert to EUR because it's an all GBP transfer.. however for amounts under £1000 it may actually be cheaper to send to kraken's EUR account anyway as there is no deposit fee on their end for EUR SEPA transfers.

I think it uses SWIFT, so it incurs whatever fees your bank charges for SWIFT.

I find it amazing that these kinds of things are tolerated by the banks, but apparently it's a legit service.

Use one of the main exchanges. Either bitstamp.net, anxbtc.com or maybe coinfloor but they have less volume. bitstamp has no gbp market, but their bank converts gbp to usd at a good rate so it doesn't matter. 
I would avoid kraken for now.. their gbp market has less than 1BTC of volume today. You could trade in eur on their eur market instead but then you'll have to pay forex fees of 2.5% so not really worth it.

kraken only accepts US users from US states where there aren't any money transmitter license requirements (SC, NM, MO iirc). If you live outside these states (but do live in the US) you cannot trade fiat on kraken even though they don't take deposits through any american banks.

[cex.io]( claims to allow card transactions using 3d secure credit cards without requiring additional ID (I have not tried this myself). They do bill in EUR though so you get fx charges and their fee is around 4% iirc so you're looking at maybe 7-8% in fees (fx conversion + cex card fee).
[circle]( sometimes allows account creation without requiring scans but sometimes they don't. If you succeed you might be able to use a uk credit or debit card with it.. you just have to ignore the warnings about non-us cards not working and add it as if it were a us card..  unfortunately it bills in USD (so fx fees again) and also attracts cash advance fees.
On [kraken]( you can get tier2 'verification' just by filling in your DOB and address (no id scans needed). Now.. the only way to deposit to kraken is by wire (or sepa if depositing euros) transfer, but the fees for sending a wire probably start to get less than using a card around the £500 mark.
 - allows funding by wire transfer without verification. No euro trading or sepa access.. just regular SWIFT wires in USD (or CAD) for this one.
or as others have suggested, localbitcoins and bitbargain are good choices as well.. sometimes lbc traders will let you verify using a scan of your debit card with the numbers erased (just a trivial 'proof of name').. not always though and it seems like they are getting more paranoid and wanting more id these days.

From the [coinbase blog]( it practically admits that they were vulnerable.
We also looked into the technical details of the transaction malleability issue and *just this morning* added additional security measures to our software to further prevent such an attack.
I don't remember if any other exchanges made such a public admission, but then why would they.. they probably just quietly fixed it.

Yea.. that may work next friday when hopefully there are some large bitcoin discounts available.. but normally it's still cheaper to pay for things using a credit/debit card. Even if it isn't, 3% of $100 is $3.. if you're making an impulse buy &lt;$100 somewhere that takes cards it's certainly not worth your time to go and buy bitcoins just to make that purchase. If you already have some then maybe, but acually going out and buying btc only to immediately give them to the site that will sell them anyway.. waste of time.

There is a central ledger.. the company share register.. it's usually maintained by a registrar appointed by the company in question.. but as I said most people who owns shares in a brokerage account do not have their names on the shareholder register. If you withdraw your shares from your brokerage in the form of a certificate that will ensure that you really do own them and your name will appear on the share register. 
Instead most of the shares are owned in the register by some corporate entities that hold them for other people and brokerages.. and they trade them back and forth by updating their own private ledgers of accounts rather than the official shareholder register. as you can imagine this pretty much guarantees that somewhere someone will not own enough shares to cover what they've told someone they have.. maybe some trade feed breaks for an hour and a bunch of trades get confirmed on one side but not the other.. without even considering malice it's just bound to happen at some point. If you do consider malice - well it's probably easy to make something that happens anyway happen to a larger extent if it benefits you.
Most shareholders today have only  'beneficial ownership' - which is basically not ownership.. they own the benefits of owning a share (being payed dividends) and in theory being able to vote - but if everyone bothered to vote the brokerage might not be able to find enough shares to vote with and in a multi-level trust system all they're really doing is sending the votes to the next counterparty saying how to vote and the counterparty says "ok done".. there's no way anyone can tell if it actually happend or not.
There is a way to fix this situation.. in europe some counterparties (euroclear in particular) have signed agreements with the larger registrar providers (the companies that maintain the company shareholder registers) - allowing them to update the register with the name of the real owner. So instead of the counterparty having shares in their own name and maintaining an internal ledger they have control to update the owner on the main register for a certain block of shares.. it makes the system more transparent.. but it's not always used.

Withdraw the cash from an ATM and give it to a localbitcoins trader (or deposit it at your bank and use a bank transfer to send it to an exchange).. really the best way to do it is to use the gift card on other spending you would have made anyway, thereby leaving more savings in your bank account which can be transferred to an exchange.

Yes - when you send BTC the nodes that you are directly connected too will see the transaction as coming from your IP first. Because all your BTC transactions may be linked together by common keys in your wallet there's a good chance that you will eventually send a transaction directly to a node that logs your IP and can then figure out what other previous transactions might be related. 
They still don't know for sure that it's your IP but I guess if over the weeks they consistently see the same wallet keys originating transactions out of a certain IP or network then they could have a reasonable amount of confidence that it's your IP.
Receiving can also expose your IP if you are using a thin client as they tell other nodes (vaguely) what addresses they are interested in seeing transactions for. This happens using a bloom filter which doesn't exactly expose your addresses but again over time there's probably some way to pin you down.. especially if combined with information from the sent transactions.

Sure it was bad publicity.. was it 'totally fabricated'? No.. mtgox really did lose BTC to tx malleability.
You can believe Karpeles knew when he gave the interview that most of the coins were lost some other way.. but there are no facts to back that assertion.
Maybe he did but was prevented from giving the real reason by a gag order.. or maybe he just didn't know and assumed that it was all stolen the same way (ie, through tx malleability). 
To this day we still don't know how it happened.. maybe Mark still doesn't know either.

1. basically the 'channel' is a multisignature address that is part controlled by you and part by the receiver.. the funds get added too it and those adding transactions *are* broadcast and commited to the blockchain. The receiver will never sign payments from the channel to someone else. What isn't committed are transactions spending from this channel address to another address controlled by only the receiver. Those incremental payments are just kept by the receiver and only broadcast when they want to close the channel.
2. the funds in the channel are commited to the blockchain.. it's only payments out of the channel to the recipient that are kept secret until the channel is closed off.

bitmixer.io is fronted by cloudflare. they also (hilariously) have a 'code' where you can voluntarily tell them about other times you've mixed on their platform. Imo using this platform (or really any mixer as they are probably almost all similarly infiltrated and it's impossible to know which if any aren't) is probably more likely to draw attention to your transactions than improve your anonymity.

sure - pretty much any exchange (bitstamp/bitfinex/coinbase/kraken/zyado) can send SWIFT wire transfers to anywhere.. but only in USD or EUR (in the case of kraken/zyado) so your receiving bank would probably charge to convert between USD/EUR to ILS... would that be any cheaper than just sending them a wire in BRL direct from the brazilian bank?

Even if 21 did take over all mining it might still be decentralized in a way.. since the chips have 21's payment address hard-coded into them and the operators of the wifi routers are not earning shares.. just benefiting from some decreased initial cost of their router there's really no reason for the router/miner to contact a traditional centralized pool to get work.. they can just connect to the bitcoin p2p network and also provide a shedload of additional bitcoin nodes in the process. If each wifi router is just solo mining and assembling their own blocks it would vastly improve the decentralized transaction verification aspect of bitcoin even while concentrating the mining profits in the hands of a single company. In practice even this might be further decentralized if say each router vendor collects the funding to their own address.

The main attraction will be that because you have NASDAQ shares on the bitcoin blockchain they can be paid for using BTC and the exchange happens at the same time with no risk of the shares not being delivered or the BTC not being delivered. You can of course also settle in fiat out of band, but most likely a lot of people will choose to settle using BTC for convenience.

eh. not really.. Visa and Mastercard introduced Original Credit Transfers (OCT) several years ago.. they tried to make it mandatory for all card issuers to accept them back in 2010 - but a lot of issuers dragged their feet and I guess it's taken them until now to get enough support to make it worthwhile rolling out customer facing services (eg, Visa Money transfer and Mastercard Send) on top of this.
btc-e.com has been one of the earliest adopters of OCT allowing withdrawls to cards for several years now.. circle.com does as well.. bitcoin related services have been at the forefront of this for a while already.

It's usually better to not use SEPA.. if you do use SEPA your bank converts your GBP into EUR before sending it and then bitstamp's bank converts it to USD on their end when they receive the EUR.
If you send it as GBP using SWIFT then no EUR conversion happens and bitstamp's bank converts the GBP to USD.
The difference is that with option number two, your bank doesn't get to charge 2.5% for uselessly converting the GBP to EUR.

I went to look for one of them.. no trace of the shop.. just one anecdote but I get the feeling that those branch maps are a bit like coinmap.org - businesses that may have at one time tried out various money transfer systems but maybe don't anymore.. basically I don't get the feeling that the money transfer companies like unistream, contact, intelexpress or moneypolo  have a very deep relationship with their agents and possibly don't really know if they exist or if they actually can process transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:56:55
true.. however bitstamp doesn't charge much to convert GBP to USD.. some of the other exchanges charge percentage deposit fees for GBP (kraken, btce) so it's not as clear cut as you might think.
 coincorner has no deposit fees and has a GBP account.
 coinfloor charges a £5 deposit fee.
 kraken charges a 0.1900% deposit fee on GBP with a £10 minimum
 btce charges a 1% deposit fee and actually requires an okpay or 
moneypolo account to make deposits in GBP anyway.
 bitstamp's bank fx rates ~0.0482%
 anxbtc doesn't charge any fees, however when sending to hong kong my bank chose to send the SWIFT transfer through an intermediary bank that charged some percentage fee for doing nothing.
coincorner looks like the best deal in theory, but they don't have a lot of volume.. so bitstamp might still be the best choice actually.
edit: another option for GBP is netagio.com. They have two GBP deposit options.. one is a SWIFT transfer to trustpay in slovakia which attracts a 1.5% deposit fee. The other is a swift transfer to netagio's own GBP bank account in Botswana! (how exotic haha) which has no fee.

Coinbase does not have UK banking. They have a GBP denominated bank account in the republic of Estonia with LHV bank. Deposits and withdrawals are only possible via SWIFT. This is the same setup used by Coinfloor.
I've read (but cannot personally confirm) that it can cost £35 to withdraw from coinbase back to a UK based bank. Coinfloor is cheaper (dunno why). Deposits aren't quite so bad and can even be free with some bank accounts (eg, lloyds offshore, citibank gold).. but withdrawals are unlikely to be useful for most people unless they are withdrawing quite a large sum.

Basically Alice needs to sign a transaction spending the previous transaction to Bob. The transaction needs to be signed by the private key corresponding to the public key that previously received the transaction being spent. The private key is never broadcast, only the signature and public key are. The public key must be broadcast because there's no way using just the address to verify that the signature is valid.
When the transaction was previously sent to Alice most likely only the address is recorded in that transaction (although it is possible to pay to public keys too, but it's not normal). In order for other nodes to check and see that Alice is able to spend that transaction to Bob they need to take the public key, and check that it maps to the same address that the transaction was sent to Alice on. That process can only happen in one direction.. you can derive the address from the public key, but not the public key from the address.. so when Alice spends her transaction she must reveal the public key along with the signature so that it can be verified.

Basically they are probably operating illegally.. but so far the govt doesn't seem to care.. at some point once coinbase and circle are licensed they may start to care though and those other exchanges will probably get shut down unless they can quickly get licensed or maybe form some kind of partnership agreement with an existing licensee. Kraken only operates in the states that have no money transmitter licensing requirements.
In the US there is no such thing as a nation wide license to operate (well actually a full banking license would probably do it) which is why noone has acquired one. There is a federal registry of MSBs which probably all bitcoin companies have registered but it's basically just a simple box ticking exercise and it doesn't in any way help the registered company be licensed in any state. There are three states (MO, SC and NM) that don't require a license for a company to engage in money service business type activity.. Kraken operates in those states only.. other exchanges such as campbx and cryptsy are probably in violation of state licensing laws but so far noone has bothered to shut them down.

[Kraken]( lets you trade up to $2000/day $10k/mo with tier2 verification which is just self-declared name/address. For higher amounts you need to upload passport/utility bill scans.
[Cointrader]( also allows some trading without verification (same limits $2000/day $10k/mo).
You pretty much have to expect that at any point any exchange that hasn't verified you can freeze your account and demand a passport upload anyway though.. and most likely it will happen at the most inconvenient time. Lately even ones that have verified you may randomly demand an ID selfie of you holding your passport as well.

I haven't tried withdrawing to non-US cards, however I don't see why it wouldn't work. It does work on btc-e. You can also get virtual and physical cards from  - loadable via btc. Also pretty much every fx service (eg, instaforex) has debit cards and BTC reload now. Really though there are very few good use cases for such services.. sure I can't 'enforce' anything on anyone.. a lot of people do seem to have a hardon for using cards but most of them would be better off not using them. It's no problem to send wire transfers while traveling.. if you really need it to clear fast there's sofort banking.

It sounds like a lot of hassle to steal a small amount of money though.

I don't really understand myself.. but it says someone can issue a bitUSD in exchange for enough collateral in another cryptocurrency (called BTS/PTS - which I think is similar to an altcoin) to cover the amount 'borrowed'. The borrowed bitUSD can then circulate in the bitUSD economy.. ie, the borrower can spend it.. but if the value of their collateral in BTS gets too low based on market rates for BTS vs the USD then the BTS that were pledged as collateral for the bitUSD loan will be seized and used to purchase a bitUSD from someone else.. thereby extinguishing one bitUSD from existance.. so maybe think of it as a kind of derivative contract that can always be redeemed for 1 USD of value in BTS.. I wonder how the distributed exchange manages to track BTS prices in a distributed manner though.. infact I kindof doubt that it does this as I don't really see how it can when BTS/PTS are traded on normal centralized exchanges.. still that might be ok... at least the risk seems spread out a bit more than with a typical centralized issuer.

I don't think there are any others exchanges with ach ability.. this is mainly because of money transmission laws.. circle and coinbase are not proper exchanges in that they don't store any USD on their sites only bitcoin - that's why when you sell your BTC it goes straight into your bank account.. at least until recently.. coinbase appears to have obtained money licenses in some states and now has USD wallets in some of them so you can maintain a USD balance if your address is in one of the licesed states.. anyway most exchanges are based outside the US to get around these licensing requirements and don't have access to US banking ach.
You can withdraw using SWIFT wire transfers from most exchanges.. just ask your bank for your SWIFT information if you don't know it.. of course the fees for SWIFT transfers tend to be higher than for ach. If you're sending large amounts of money.. say over $5k then it's worth considering.. otherwise I think you're generally better of with coinbase/circle..
You could also look at brawker.com and purse.io - two services that allow you to buy amazon (and other) stuff online by getting people who want your bitcoins to buy it for you at a discount (ie, you give them less bitcoins than the thing cost). Not strictly a cash out mechanism, however perhaps you can use it to offset purchases you would otherwise have made from your checking account anyway.

Hungary supports SEPA but the end bank account may (probably) be denominated in HUF (Hungarian Forint) rather than EUR.. which means the recipient's bank will still charge a (guessing) 2.5% fx fee to convert the EUR from bitstamp into HUF.
Probably the best way to cash out would be to use localbitcoins to sell BTC for HUF.. the [lowest offer]( on localbitcoins is currently 71050.62 HUF which is USD 257, so possibly you could make a profit on the transfer instead of a loss.. of course that comes with accepting the risk of a stranger paying into your bank account. And for $8000 worth of BTC probably the hassle of dealing with multiple such strangers to cover the whole amount.

Yea.. you've got it.. It is functionally identical to having an unverified account with a bitcoin exchange that allows unverified users to trade crypto (but not withdraw back to a bank account without verification).

This already exists and has existed for years in the form of every bitcoin exchange out there.. deposit BTC.. sell for USD.. hold USD on the exchange.. it's no less secure than bitreserve.. they're all unlicensed financial companies that might disappear with your money.
I don't even think it's particularly desireable actually.. you're going to all the effort and paying fees to obtain BTC and then converting it back to USD and storing it in a bank.. except it's not even a licensed/regulated bank it's just some ltd company.
Maybe all it needs is someone to explain it to people in a new way but I'm very skeptical. The main use case I see is as a way to hold USD somewhat anonymously in an unverified account.. but given the significant risks I don't think anyone would want to store a lot of USD in an unverified account and for small amounts there are probably easier ways - cash in a shoebox?
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:33:12

The issue is really the fees. Circle charges a 2.9% iirc fee for using cards and since they bill in USD your bank will charge an additional 2.5% forex fee and in some cases another 3% cash advance fee as it's billed as a quasi cash service. These fees basically make it not worth bothering with imo. 
Some people have had issues connecting their cards but it's probably just their bank rejecting the circle test transaction. Basically you just need to call your bank and ask if they rejected it and ask them to please not reject it in the future and then re-attempt connecting your card. It's not that it's really hard (at least it wasn't for me).. it's just not really worth it.

I'm still very skeptical that this works.. The user could have another session on a different browser changing things (like the payee) that the arbitrator can't see.
edit: thinking about this some more.. these kind of attacks may well work against sofort banking in real life.. sofort I think probably uses Yodlee to do most of the scraping stuff.. and actually some larger banks have already implemented an API for yodlee and thus sofort to use that perhaps makes this more secure.. however if you use a bank where they still use web screen scraping I suspect in some cases it may well be possible to swap out a payee at just the right moment to steal back your own transfers.

I think what's actually happening is Sparkasse is calling customers and asking them if they meant to do the transfer.  If you say 'yes' they will send it. If you say 'No, I was hacked' then they'll reverse it. Sparkasse is not stopping their customers from sending wires to any bitcoin exchange accounts (at least that's my impression).
The problem is that this breaks Sofort's business model since it relies on people not being able to easily reverse wires initiated on their platform.

not really.. and actually what you propose probably won't even work either, as near every bitcoin service is hosted behind cloudflare (lbc is, so is coinbase, so is bitmixer, blockchain.info, bitfinex and even btc-e.com), so they (cloudflare/the nsa) can see _all_ your deposit addresses/withdrawals and could link them back to the source. bitcoin is not anonymous from the state.. it might protect your 'privacy' from neighbours or family but not from the government.

I think one major problem with this is that probably most online banking doesn't actually give enough information to verify whether or not a payment was really sent. 
If you check the statement it doesn't usually show the full destination account number - usually just whatever the user entered as the name and reference number. 
While it may be possible to check the information on the payees page and correlate it, I suspect that it's probably quite possible to change the payee from your own account number to the correct one in between the tls verification of each page.. 
So yea.. it's a cool idea, but until the banks actually modify their online banking sites to accommodate the concept I don't think it will work for most real world use cases.
Other thoughts; this is actually very similar conceptually to how sofort banking works.. basically you give sofort your login/password and they log into your account and actually setup and do the transfer. Several bitcoin exchanges do support using sofort banking for instant bank transfers already.. because sofort makes the transfer they know that it will go through and I guess guarantee it to the bitcoin exchange so that your account gets credited immediately instead of waiting 5 days.

The [defense attorney hinted]( that lots of BTC are missing from the silkroad.. [early reports]( of the silkroad bust suggested that the silkroad had far more BTC but that hasn't been mentioned recently. I suspect these will turn out to be BTC that were on deposit at mtgox. 
Conveniently these will not have to be repaid, significantly reducing mtgox's liability to the point where maybe everyone will get their money back. Also, the Tokyo court plans to return the mtgox BTC through kraken.com which will conveniently obscure where they came from as they will be mixed with other coins on the kraken exchange. It's entirely possible that the coins stolen from bitstamp and other scams will be returned in this way for example.
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:39:55
Sure you can.. most likely the fees will make it unattractive. You can also just withdraw money to any card visa/mastercard (including some prepaid cards) from circle or btc-e ($1000 minimum though on btce). Circle probably has the lowest fees for this kind of service so maybe you should just try it with a few prepaid cards and see if you can find one that works.
It's always going to be cheaper to withdraw to a bank account or more profitable to get cash from someone on localbitcoins. IMO bitcoin and debit cards are not really a smart idea. If you constantly find yourself in a position where you can't wait a couple of days to get money via a bank transfer you should maybe reconsider your general money management strategy.

Basically no. There are a few services that work with debit/credit cards.. [bittylicious]( supports GBP card billing, as does [coinfloor]( There's also [cex.io]( - which bills in EUR and [circle]( which bills in USD. 
None of these options will be significantly cheaper than using [localbitcoins]( because of high card processing fees, and in the case of cex.io and circle foreign exchange and cash advance fees.
There is no convenient way to buy BTC in the UK for less than about 5% - which is around what you can expect to pay on localbitcoins. There is also seemingly no chance of anyone building such a service because no banks in the UK will allow exchanges to open bank accounts.
The best option I've seen is to open an account with  [Lloyds international]( They offer free outbound SWIFT transfers. If you get a GBP account with them you can load money into the lloyds account using faster payments (or just use it as your primary bank account to receive your salary etc) and then send it to coinbase's GBP account in Estonia via SWIFT.

Here's a list of all the state MSB licenses paypal holds;
I imagine coinbase is basically copying that.
There are other exchanges that have been issued licenses by various government bodies.. coinfloor.co.uk for instance obtained a bureau de change license from HMRC. 
 "4.2 Coinfloor is registered with HMRC with registration number 12713897 under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 as a Bureau de Change."
ANXBTC in hong kong also obtained a money services organization license from the Hong Kong authorities.
 "ANX is approved for Foreign Exchange as a Money Services Operator (MSO) with a license issued by the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (License No. 13-09-01268). "

Using SEPA requires that your bank convert your money into EUR before sending it.. that means you get nailed with a 2.5% forex conversion fee on top of whatever the fixed charge for sending a SEPA transfer is. SEPA is a bad choice for UK users - and probably anyone in any countries in europe that haven't adopted the euro.
It's actually better to use regular SWIFT transfers and send the funds as GBP - either to an exchange that accepts GBP such as coinfloor (which has a GBP account in Poland) or to an exchange that will cheaply convert any GBP they receive to a USD account into USD (bitstamp does this).

Transferwise is a much better way to send money internationally than bitcoin if it's going between two bank accounts.. however transferwise only supports a few countries and it only works if both the sender and receiver have a bank account. Other companies like currencyfair or xe.com do the same thing and support more countries and actually I think xe has some cash delivery options too. 
Bitcoin can probably never beat these companies on a cost basis because it necessarilly means two exchanges say USD -&gt; BTC and then BTC -&gt; EUR instead of just directly USD -&gt; EUR.. two trades on two different exchanges is probably always going to mean more fees than one trade initiated on one exchange all other things being equal.
I think bitcoin will still gain market share in this space even though it's an inferior solution just because lots of people will end up having bitcoin accounts and it will become the universal way to do things.. gradually people will come to know about bitcoin and it works everywhere while transferwise and currencyfair only work in certain situations. It's like how people reach for paypal even though transferwise exists just because they are more accustomed to using it.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:08:10
I don't remember such an option ever being advertised on their site. The question is just who converts it.. the sender or the receiver. You can wire GBP to any account anywhere and the let the recipient bank convert it into the receiving account's currency. This often works out better than converting it yourself prior to sending as the recipient may have a more favourable arrangement with their bank with regards to foreign exchange fees than you have with your own.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:23:25
The main thing that's stupid about that is that if you have an OKPay account you already have access to btc-e and several other bitcoin exchanges.. infact OKPay will happily convert your money into BTC themselves.. so why use Coinffeine. Basically Coinffeine solves the wrong problem (BTC sellers not delivering coin) - when the real problem (solved by OKPay) is that buyers sometimes reverse their payments after the seller thinks they've been paid (because they see it hit their bank account or payment proessor).

You can't do anything with it other than convert it back to BTC for a payment. 
It's basically the exact same thing as selling some BTC on an exchange and holding the USD (or GBP or whatever) on the exchange to later re-buy BTC and withdraw it again (possibly to spend on something).  Except if it was held on an exchange you could actually withdraw it using SWIFT too whereas with bitreserve the only withdraw mechanism is buy BTC. It's the same as having an unverified exchange account with only crypto deposit/withdraw functionality.
It means you can hold money in an unlicensed financial institution instead of a bank or in bitcoin.. so you can avoid most of the advantages of holding your own money and miss out on any price appreciation in BTC while still pretending to use it :p /s

I expect all the other "anti"-ddos services are used for similar purposes.. they all necessarilly have good relations with govt cyberwar agencies.
I heard that BGP hijack monitoring systems have been configured to ignore alerts from known DDOS protection companies because they routinely re-route their customers' IP space.. which is basically the same thing as a hijack except with permission from the customer.. of course if they wanted to hijack anything else without authorization they could now do so without setting off those alarms.

  The site presents a challenge QR code.
  You scan the QR code with your phone and approve signing it.

  The site refreshes automatically logging you in.

I think you can still verify on kraken.com for tier2 status without uploading any documents (just enter name/dob/address info on their form).

Not really.. forex sites will usually be cheaper than bitcoin as it's just a single exchange of JPY to CAD instead of a two stage transfer JPY to BTC to CAD and paying fees on two different exchanges. It's also far more convenient as you only have to register on the one forex site and they usually have less intrusive customer verification procedures than bitcoin exchanges. Honestly if you just want to move JPY to CAD I would just use a forex site..
To make bitcoin work for you a bit better you can use localbitcoins.com to cash out on the remote end.. Usually the localbitcoins prices for BTC are higher than on an exchange so you might even make a slight profit on the transfer this way.. be careful that you're selling to a reputable buyer though as they might be trying to scam you by paying into your Canadian bank account and then reversing the payment after they've got your BTC.

It said on one of those pitch graphics in the kaminska article that they mined millions of BTC using their chips in 2014.. at $200+ per BTC, if true; they've already made back their VC money.. if they then find a secondary use for their old asic design in the consumer electronics market where people will be ok with running them even if they're very unprofitable (but still a low/unnoticeable increase in the electric bill) then maybe there's some value in that.
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:13:59
Not necessarily.. if the nodes solo mined then noone would really be in control of them except I guess for periodic firmware upgrades.
Since the device owners don't earn shares there's no need to submit work to a pool (ie, to prove that you're mining).. instead one of the millions of devices solo mining now and again finds a block and pays the fees and subsidy to the hard coded payment address which might belong to the device vendor. 
There could maybe be a bit of centralization such as a server serving an up to date list of unspent outputs checkpointed at a certain block height to spare the devices storing the entire blockchain.. mainly the important part is that they would be connected to the p2p network and would relay blocks and transactions (greatly increasing the number of available bitcoin nodes) and they would build their own blocks from the transactions they see on the p2p network rather than from a central pool.

I'm guessing that 35% includes the 'blue dollar' exchange rate. Basically Argentinians are allowed to take a certain amount of foreign currency on holiday at the official government rate (which is subsidized).. but anything more than that they have to use the real market rate which is worse for them. 
Looking at localbitcoins.com buying bitcoins is about 35% more expensive than the official govt rate of conversion.. so it's doubtful that any major savings can be made using btc.. basically people only sell bitcoins at the 'real' rate, not the (better) government rate.

They do; basically when you buy shares at a brokerage they are almost never registered in your name on the company's shareholder register ledger but kept in the name of some entity related to the broker.. or assigned to the DTCC's "Cede &amp; Co" entity.
There can be multi-level trust relationships like that where the shares in your brokerage account are owned through a subsidiary of the brokerage who has a contract with a custodian that could be some other brokerage who has an account with the DTCC. There's often no clear path between the numbers you see in your brokerage account and any actual shares in the company you supposedly own shares in. 
When you bought the shares they probably were credited to a custodian somewhere (although sometimes not), but the custodian might just immediately lend them out again.. or already be in a fractional reserve situation.
At any point in the chain someone may or may not actually bother to stock enough shares to cover their liabilities at all times. Apparently even the DTCC has sometimes failed to hold enough stock to cover all their balances.

I don't think it matters that much.. probably any of the main ones are equally terrible.. ie, lloyds, natwest, barclays etc. There aren't any 'good' ones afaik.. they will probably all close your account if someone reverses a payment on you. If you go with a really obscure one then maybe the faster payments will take longer.. perhaps up to 2 hrs to clear instead of a few min. I've also heard that hsbc is slow.
If you're rich then citibank.co.uk and international.lloydsbank.com have accounts with free SWIFT transfers which is very useful as no exchanges have bank accounts in the UK.
barclays has expensive (£25) SWIFT transfers.. so maybe lloyds or natwest (£10) would be a good choice.

I haven't used bitstamp recently, but it used to be that if you sent a wire transfer in GBP (eg, a SWIFT transfer, not a SEPA EUR transfer) they would convert it to USD on reasonable terms. You're still stuck paying your bank's SWIFT fee but that's usually a fixed amount (like £10-25) rather than a percentage. If you send a SEPA transfer then your bank will take around 3% to pointlessly convert the money into EUR before bitstamp then converts it into USD anyway. I think they've changed banks a few times since I last used them though so I have no idea how effective this is currently.
I would also recommend coinfloor.. since they do use GBP natively there definitely won't be any fx conversion (just don't use SEPA!).. but there may not really be much difference in the total cost to buy between bitstamp and coinfloor using a GBP wire transfer as bitstamps often seems to have slightly lower prices that may compensate for the GBP-&gt;USD fx conversion depending on how efficiently bitstamp's current bank handles that.
anxbtc/anxpro and coinbase also have usable GBP orderbooks.. anxbtc has a bank account in hong kong and coinbase uses the same bank as coinfloor in estonia.

Hmm.. there might be some other explanation.. is it a joint account? Perhaps your wife's name is on it or the associated postal address might be different than whatever you registered with coinbase? Just because the payment goes through an intermediary doesn't mean that the original sender information is stripped from the wire.

coin.mx tried pretty much exactly this using  to process their ACH traffic.. it didn't work out too well for them.. you might say thats because they didn't follow the rules properly and that might be true, but really probably the powers that be didn't want them operating and shut them down instead of trying to work with them.

If you withdraw your coinbase funds then they're no-longer in coinbase.. the main problem is that coinbase might decide that they're free to sell all your coins on the 'losing' side of the chain - then if that chain later 'wins' they would be insolvent or you would have just lost your funds.. or alternatively they might at least deprive you of the opportunity to sell your coins on the losing side.

It's not uncommon for localbitcoins sellers to ask for ID.. especially with bank transfer (rather than cash deposit) transactions.
localbitcoins does now have an option where you can get them to verify you which may satisfy the seller (ie, instead of sending the scans directly to the seller) and then at least only localbitcoins/netverify has your info.
If you're willing to go thorough identity procedures you probably might as well just register on a proper bitcoin exchange and benefit from lower bitcoin prices.

I think we're mostly talking past each other.. you keep mentioning in person meetups.. but localbitcoins transactions are mostly by online methods (at least in the UK). The worst thing that can happen is you lose your money and actually that is very unlikely to happen since the seller would lose their bitcoins in the lbc escrow. The main risk is in selling bitcoins on localbitcoins because there is almost no risk for the buyer. Considering the op was only buying a few dollars worth probably wouldn't be the end of the world even if the money did go missing.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:56:11
neither coinbase or circle are really viable options in the UK due to fees and they probably will also require ID which the OP doesn't want.. unfortunately there really aren't any good options in the UK at all and the best options are p2p bank transfer markets like localbitcoins and bitbargain.. I wouldn't recommend an in person meetup - mainly because it's inconvenient and a a waste of time but localbitcoins sellers have lots of options in particular national bank transfers which are normally very convenient.. the downside here is that probably noone on localbitcoins will sell to a newbie via bank transfer without ID which the op doesn't want..

Well I expect most people could live just fine on $500/day.. even eur60/day or at least 120eur/day for a couple is actually fairly generous.. the average salary in Greece is only around 13k eur/yr.. so 120eur/day (for a couple) is 3720eur/mo or eur 44640/yr (and that's post tax- to actually earn that you'd have to be making over 60k/yr) so really the majority of the population can still withdraw their entire salary as cash as long as they take it out bit by bit each day.

even localbitcoins isn't particularly anonymous.. it's fronted by cloudflare.. as is reddit and almost every other bitcoin related service.. cloudflare is in a position where they can see all the communication in plaintext.. including deposit/withdrawal addresses, usernames, passwords, converstations and any ID exchanged. 
They also front reddit, shapeshift, various bitcoin mixers and many many other sites and will be able to tell that you're the same person between sites.. sure theoretically maybe it's possible to use tor and vpns and a fresh browser (no history/cookies or unique identifying factors) but realistically almost noone is capable of maintaining the necessary opsec procedures to remain anonymous for long. 
There is no realistic way to use bitcoin anonymously.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:59:15
Fragmenting the opposition to the status quo just means that nothing will happen imo.
It may well be that nothing happens anyway.. for a while I thought that the blocksize increase was a small enough change and bitcoin still not widely adopted enough to stop the developers just forcing it down everyone's throats but that is starting to seem less likely imo.
At the end of the day increasing the blocksize doesn't actually help with mass adoption.. at best it buys a few months of cheaper transactions.. it can't be increased enough to handle day to day mass adoption so eventually (unless it fails) it is destined to fulfill a settlement role anyway.. even in a settlement role it might be nice if the limit were a bit higher, but it probably doesn't matter that much either way.

There are some things happening that will probably help.. cheaper SWIFT transfers would make using offshore exchanges more attractive and card billing is a real option.. circle is a bit too expensive but if there was something like circle that could bill in GBP for only a 2.9% fee that would probably be quite an attractive proposition.
It might also be possible to do some kind of deal with a bank where every exchange customer has their own account at the same bank and any bitcoin related transfers are settled as internal bank transfers inside the same bank.
I think part of the reluctance to invest in any extreme solutions like this is that eventually probably the clearing banks will relax their stance and allow btc related payments in a normal way.
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:46:11

Basically you would have to apply to their new Committee of Banking Transactions Approval for any international bank transfers.. I would assume that bitcoin purchasing would not be considered an acceptable reason. They can send unlimited transfers within Greece though so a local exchange does work. Some people skilled in fraud and with the right contacts to bribe will probably be able to get wires approved.. they can sell BTC to acquire greek euros, and then recycle them externally for a profit. Small timers can probably also do this to some extent simply by transferring the euros back to their own account and withdrawing them as cash from an ATM.. the more accounts or rather cards they have the more cash euros they can withdraw.

yea.. the two main exchanges for GBP - coinbase and coinfloor use bank accounts in Estonia.. you can send money there from natwest but it costs £10 per transfer. There are no actual exchanges (only p2p marketplaces) that support normal faster payments transfers.. lots of people have tried to start them but they always get shut down by the banks. maybe it will improve later this year.. or at least there will be options for current accounts with cheaper foreign swift transfers to reach coinbase/coinfloor.

well.. I wouldn't really recommend it.. it's far more likely to cause grief than linking your bank account to one of those other services.. but I expect it will work as long as you're careful.. maybe split up the buy between a few different ebay sellers and hopefully they won't all turn out to be scammers.
I guess one thing I would say is that if you pay as a gift (seller may ask for that since it reduces their risk a bit) you won't be able to charge back through paypal (so don't think you have no risk of being scammed just because you're using paypal). It can be charged back by the credit card if you paid that way, but of course that will destroy your relationship with paypal.

I would assume that the btc sellers are withdrawing their euros back to their (greek) bank accounts.. from there, there may still be some ways to extricate the euros from greece. Multiple bank accounts could possibly be used to withdraw the funds as cash (bypassing per account limits with multiple accounts). Possibly remittances abroad may still allowed under some circumstances ("tuition"? medical emergencies?)
edit: [an explanation of the capital controls in place]( - in theory you could put everyone in your family as secondary holders on each others accounts and multiply your cash withdrawals exponentially.. take a family of 4, each person has their own account and also puts everyone else on their accounts.. now they have a combined daily withdrawal total of 960 instead of 240 eur.

kraken.com allows purchasing by SEPA transfer with only a self declared name for up to $1000/day or $2000/day with a verified address (bill scan). SEPA transfers must be made from a matching account (ie, same name and address - which will be included in the sepa transfer details so there is no possibility to use a fake name/address really).
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:53:33
To use the exchange you need to send a SWIFT transfer to coinfloor's Estonian bank account.. this costs most people in the UK around £10-25. 
The market sellers have UK banking which is free and instant (although they constantly have to dodge account closures and reopen new ones).
The upshot is that if you're buying less than £200 to £500 then the 5% fee charged by the market sellers is less than the £10-£25 your bank would charge.
@_date: 2015-08-26 14:49:49

those businesses may have some frequently re-used addresses (reused hotwallet addrs, cold storage).. coinbase (or some data provider) could speculatively go out and make deposits to businesses they want to ban and watch where the coins go.. then when they see their own customers coins going through those same addresses - even though they go through one new fresh deposit address first they know with a reasonable confidence that actually that was a payment to some banned service.. how? Consider this;
&lt;coinbase customer&gt; -&gt; &lt;one time deposit address&gt; -&gt; &lt;watched address linked to banned service&gt;
If you know that the banned service always makes a one time deposit address then even though you don't know any of the one time deposit addresses you can easily find them by looking back from the watched address. If you see something like the above it almost certainly does mean that the coinbase customer paid the banned service. If they had paid someone else who then paid the banned service there would be at least one more unknown hop in the chain.
Now lots of banned services may not really like that coinbase bans their customers so they might take evasive action and try not to reuse addresses.. but it's difficult and if you don't care about 100% accuracy the suspicion engine can be extended for a few more levels of abstraction and probably still be fairly accurate.. also even if it doesn't work all the time if you catch a few people red handed, close their accounts and they complain about it on reddit it will help to scare the rest of the customers so that they don't do it.
there's also the issue that cloudflare does know all the deposit addresses for pretty much every bitcoin service because they get to mitm all the web traffic.. I don't know if this information is being channeled to coinbase somehow but I'm quite sure the intelligence agencies know what addresses correspond to which services.. possibly some of that intel gets laundered into the public domain somehow.. like to help with constructing and maintaining a good robust list of watch addresses.

It isn't a magic option you turn on.. you need to design it into your database schema.. and appropriate access control.. but basically for each table that is used by the application there is another table that gets an insert documenting every change in the main table including what was changed, the time and who did it. People do this regularly already for the purposes of auditing changes.. it wouldn't be difficult to require a mirror of such an auditing db to be stored with a regulator or counterparty.

No. Because cloudflare terminates the ssl.. their customers provide them with the ssl certificate/key so that cloudflare can do that. It's necessary because of how cloudflare works.. they need to be able to see the request content and also they inject their own javascript into the page replies in order to test various things. If you doubt this consider how it's possible to see a cloudflare error message on an https site (this happens regularly, so you've probably seen it). Cloudflare gets to see everything passing through it in plain text.. it does this to look for bots but it could just as easily log everyone's username, password, bitcoin address and passport/id uploads.
The services can make lots of keys, but when they send outbound payments some of them will always be joined together and thus known to be related.. unless they're very careful it's possible to map out these webs of related transactions with some confidence.. especially if you already know all the deposit addresses and just need to work backwards towards a plausible excuse as to how you found them :p

It won't be empty until someone spends it.. but if someone else scanned it 6 months ago they could spend it at any time until you spend it.
edit: oh.. sweeping is different than just scanning.. with sweeping it scans it and then automatically sends it to a new address.. that way there's no worries about other copies of the key lying around, but also it's not instant anymore as you still have to wait for the sweep payment to send it to the new address (ie, exactly the same as sending it normally).

No it isn't. Are you talking about using an fx transfer company like transferwise? You can't, unfortunately - but there should be no issue with direct SEPA transfers into your bank account (other than a 3% fx loss on converting from EUR to GBP).

No you don't use SEPA, use SWIFT - send it as GBP, it arrives as GBP (coinfloor and coinbase both have GBP accounts in Estonia ) the only fee is whatever the fixed fee you bank charges for sending a SWIFT and the 5GBP SWIFT receiving fee. It's the same fees on both coinbase and coinfloor. Basically if you send 1500GBP from Lloyds or Natwest you're paying a £10 sending fee, a £5 receiving fee so 1% to get money out of the UK and safely into BTC. The fees are fixed, so in your £10k example the fee would still only be £15 or now just 0.15% instead of still almost 6% with circle (2.9% cirlce card fee + ~3% bank fx for GBP=&gt;USD conversion).

Many of the mixers may be operated by LE or hosted behind cloudflare. Tor may help but it's very easy to mess up and log into a throwaway account without using tor and then you're exposed (only needs to happen once!). Even without that you still have the deposit receipt scan and possible bank surveillance footage that might provide a link if anyone really wanted to find you.
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:43:51
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:13:27
I don't know why you'd doubt it.. I obviously have no proof that any mixers are run by LE but there are some that are fronted by cloudflare.. blockchain.info, bitmixer.io and bitcomix.com are and others run on amazon or google cloud - again these could easily be monitored by secret court orders or nsa spying without the actual operators even being aware of it. According to the official narrative silkroad was infiltrated by LE.. setting up an LE run mixer seems like a great project for a new IT intern.
Most localbitcoins transactions are not conducted in person but by depositing to the seller's bank account.. normally they require that you provide a receipt from the cashier.. but even if there isn't one the sellers bank account deposit still has the time and branch information so that could be correlated. If you meet someone in person there's always a chance they'll remember something about you.
It's not that it's impossible to be anonymous with bitcoin.. maybe it is possible.. but it's certainly not practical.
It's definitely not as simple as 'just use localbitcoins' and really I doubt that most people are capable of it.. one slip up and you can be identified and it doesn't matter if it's now or years down the road as many of your bitcoin transactions can be linked together.. either via the blockchain, mixer or exchange logs. There are always unknowns too.. like maybe some bug in tor or something like heartbleed that allowed any site you're visiting over tor to inspect your browser's memory and see what other sites you're looking at (or logged into).. you can think you're being clever and something like that comes out of nowhere.

Yes, but they all have to follow the same rules. What those rules are can be manipulated by politics.. sure everyone has to agree to do it, but manufacturing that consent is basically what the psychologists and their political actors are all about.
In the 'legacy' system anyone can run their own part of the system however they want and negotiate gateway connections to other institutions that agree to do it in ways that they find mutually agreeable. It's much more chaotic and hard to control than a nice clean system where everyone follows the same rules.
The whole decentralized/centralized debate is too vague imo... it doesn't really get at what's better or not better about the advancements.. take uber for instance.. sure on one hand it's promoting individuals providing services to each other.. but on the other it's putting thousands of decentralized small taxi firms out of business and replacing them with one central middleman skimming all the profits. 
All in all I think we'll see only a continuation of the trend towards centralization of everything.. but maybe some aspects of that centralization process will be framed as decentralization and democratization.. and that won't exactly be untrue either.. it's just a different way of looking at it.

Most of the MSB licenses seem to be around £2500 or so.

The only reason to have a blockchain is if you _really_ want the system to be decentralized.. that's all it accomplishes and it does so at enormous cost - so if you don't need it it's not the way to go.
If there's a central party coordinating things there's no reason to mine anything.. just use an sql database - it's far more efficient. 
I'm sure banks will find new centralized ways to settle remittances that will make international payments more efficient but really that has nothing to do with bitcoin or blockchains.

Perhaps.. it's possible that shill accounts would be verified too.. especially if they were created by Bridges and Force as they might have had easy access to fake IDs either through their work (as cover documentation) or via the silkroad marketplace (lots of fake id sellers there). I guess now that they're in jail they won't be able to claim for any such accounts though.
edit: other thoughts.. the amlreq state may actually be people who requested verification but hadn't been verified when mtgox collapsed. so I think it can be both people who requested verification and accounts that mtgox demanded verification for.

Using SEPA always results in your funds being converted into EUR.. or rather more accurately stated SWIFT SHA (shared fees) transfers of EUR to and from SEPA zone states qualify as SEPA transfers and are required to be charged the same as national transfers within the SEPA region (ie, often free). Non EUR transfers never qualify as SEPA.
If you thought you were sending a GBP SEPA transfer before one of two things was happening; your bank was sending a SWIFT GBP transfer and just happens to billing it the same as SEPA, or they were converting the funds to EUR and the recipient bank converted the EUR back to GBP again.
There is no such thing as a GBP SEPA transfer.

Companies that sell BTC for visa/mastercard normally require a full identity verification of the user.. so while some may process prepaid cards (maybe  or  would for instance), they will still need to know who is using them (like with a passport or other id scan). This probably negates most advantage of using a prepaid card - and in general there's probably no good reason to use them - bank transfer options are preferable.

Regulation just means an MSB registration.. they cost £100 to apply for.. it's really not a major process. Coinfloor is.. afaik so is lazycoins and probably some others.

No that isn't my point.. it's fine to hold btc and spend it as btc with btc accepting merchants. What doesn't make sense is to convert every last cent into btc and then convert it back throughout the month.
It gets you a month's expenses worth of extra extra exposure to btc. If you don't have a lot of money you definitely shouldn't do it as you may end up short for the month.
If you're fairly well off (and spend more) the fees over the course of the year will add up.. say you spend $2k/month on your debit card and it costs 2% to get money into/out of your card.. over the year you've spent $480 in fees that were *completely* unnecessary and all it got you was an extra $2k exposure to BTC that may or may not pay off.. basically the price has to appreciate 25% per year for you to break even on fees (assuming a 2% in/out loss rate.. I'm not sure how realistic that is either).
edit: actually I guess that math is pretty wonky.. you wouldn't be exposed to $2k since you're constantly spending it.. I'm not really sure how to model it but the price would have to appreciate a lot more than 25% to even break even.

you don't have too.. the wallet file (wallet.dat in bitcoin core) is the important file.

If he wants to look at it that way I don't see anything wrong with it.. the terms (centralized/decentralized) are pretty ambiguous and bitcoin is a protocol that organizes the people to use it to perform transactions in a common way.
The way payments are processed outside of bitcoin go through lots of incompatible systems at different institutions with gateways to convert the messages from one format to another.. this is actually quite decentralized and often it breaks and payments get lost or corrupted. 
With bitcoin all the transactions are recorded on a common ledger. There's only one ledger and everyone can see it.. I don't think it's wrong to call that 'centralized'.

If you tumble the coins in a tumbler then they're far more likely to be associated with nefarious activity than the ATM coins. I mean it probably doesn't matter either way, but I don't see any advantage to tumbling them in your situation. Tumbling doesn't clean coins, it merely lets you swap coins with other people so that you end up with coins that aren't related to nefarious activity that you yourself were involved in. The coins you get back are very likely to have been involved in someone else's malfeasance though.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:05:39
imo  is pretty good. They don't even advertise that they accept BTC, but they do and their fees are reasonable.

The o1.em.coinbase.com [50.31.37.137] host is a sendgrid (smtp relay) server.. perhaps someone figured out how to use coinbase's sendgrid account.

There's no convenient way to do it and the only way to actually save money vs transferwise.com or currencyfair.com (which btw, you can set up automatically and maybe you should just use instead) is by selling the BTC on localbitcoins.com .. taking a risk that someone pays into your bank account using a hacked account - but on the plus side you get a 5% premium to the coinbase price that covers your buy in fees and maybe even leaves a bit of profit... there probably isn't that much risk if you're careful who you sell too (good reputation - and make sure their name is the same as the payment) and keep it to the relatively small amounts needed for student loan payments.
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:26:40
It works, but the fees are high.. like 20-30%.. if you look around there's almost certainly a better option.

try @_date: 2015-09-29 22:02:06
It's possible, but really unless you want to try and make a profit selling BTC on localbitcoins there's no point.. you'll get better conversion rates and less fees using an fx transfer service like transferwise.com or currencyfair.com.
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:43:06
If they even cared about that an obvious way forward is to convince some random patsy to run it and then monitor it behind their back.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:16:49
I think the difference is that they now take GBP instead of just EUR. If you open an account with [lloyds international]( or if you're really loaded [citibank uk]( they have free SWIFT transfers so it would be almost as convenient as faster payments, no transfer fee and also no currency conversion.
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:21:08
I do understand the distinction you make.. if you prefer to call it a debit card I don't really object to that. It's mainly the pointless double conversion and associated slippage/fees that concern me.
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:56:01
Yes.. that does sound like a solid use case.. however if "That's the whole point of this" then I guess I agree with you.. it just isn't useful to those of us without a BTC denominated income stream :p
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:15:52
I don't think there's any confusion.. it's just that it's easier and cheaper to just retain however much fiat you need before next payday in a normal bank account instead of converting it into BTC and spending it through a high-fee prepaid card.
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:11:37
BTC wallets are for holding BTC. USD wallets are for holding USD. Your bank holds USD so you would transfer USD from your bank to the USD wallet and then make an order on the exchange to buy BTC. When the order is filled the BTC will end up in your BTC wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-10 11:01:46
Yea maybe.. it's not a perfect solution, but I'd rather have a conversation with the police at the station.. I doubt they'd arrest you since it's pretty easy to explain what happened.

imo it's very unlikely that using bitquick.co or a mixer will actually protect your identity from the intelligence sevices.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:06:38
I had a quick look at the recently leaked mtgox accounts and there are 321k BTC held in accounts that had passed AML verification. 
Around 56k BTC held in accounts that have an amlreq state - I think that means that mtgox requested verification but it was not received and around 100k BTC held in accounts that are just plain unverified.
There's also the fiat balances to consider which I haven't looked at yet.

the name of the exchange you withdrew from might be useful.

I think you're assuming that this is because of your changing your password and means they require perpetual access to your account.. I don't think this is the case (but I guess I don't really know for sure either). There might be some other explanation.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:38:25
another option might be  they say they don't require id for wire transfers - within fairly large limits.
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:59:17
They've said that it's going to be an MSB registration
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:08:07
Yes here [klmist.com]( I doubt even 500k people really use BTC in any significant manner.
@_date: 2015-09-28 12:09:30
Requiring a credit card does restrict your options, but even with that constraint [247exchange.com]( would probably work out slightly cheaper for you. 
If you can get circle.com to work with an aus cc that would also be cheaper.
I've not tried it, but  also seems to have card funding now as well - might be a good one to try since they also have an AUD market (although to get AUD you need to use wire transfers to Hong Kong).
Looking at [localbitcoins]( there are some reasonable offers for cash deposit and online banking (lowest is only a 2.5% premium to bitstamp and many other offers under 5% premium).. for small amounts I would probably just use that, or for larger amounts use a wire transfer.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:47:06
Now that they accept BTC they need to be DDOS'ed in order to get them to accept being behind cloudflare so the btc transactions can be monitored :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:29:33
It's the *absense* of a fiat income stream rather than the *presence* of a btc one that would make it useful.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:14:11
Basically if you spend those 0.001 btc that were sent to your old address as part of the same transaction as one of your new btc addresses then those addresses become linked.. they can see that you control both addresses.. it helps various people who are trying to map out address to owner relationships.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:27:19
It's like using coinbase exchange instead of coinbase. You place orders on the exchange instead of handing them to a broker who may not even put them on the exchange at all.. they might fill them themselves from their own assets or route it to some other exchange

take out a 15 year loan to buy it? I've never done this myself so I'm not sure the best way to optimize it.
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:12:05
Maybe not.. but it seems likely given that this is exactly how it works in the US (fincen registration) and [Hong Kong]( and also given that they've developed these MSB regulations basically over the last year.. sure maybe they haven't officially said it's for bitcoin exchanges but it sure seems likely to me.
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:47:57
It's a prepaid card in the sense that you load money onto it in advance of payment.. it's nice xapo don't do the conversion from btc until the last minute but ultimately unless you had an income stream in btc there's just no reason to not just keep whatever you need to spend in fiat in fiat since that's how you get it from your employer.
It generally costs a few percent to get money into BTC and although xapo says there are no spend fees as long as it's in the same currency as the card and not an ATM withdrawal there will be some loss due to exchange spread on the sale.. maybe for most people the process of buying BTC and selling BTC would only lose 2-3% but still - what's the point? I can get 0% by doing nothing and 3% of my yearly spend is probably more than I'm likely to make on freak market movements between paydays.

Transfer the money to your personal acct and then from there to the BTC exchange.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:37:04
The main use is that someone can publish a static receive address - say on a porn website or in a magazine (static content) and then customers can pay to their own derived address instead of the published one.. that way it isn't immediately obvious that they paid a known address associated with some service. 
The transaction is still visible, but the connection from the known address and the one that got paid is kept secret. 
The funds from the stealth address could then be sent directly to an exchange in order to avoid association with your other keys.
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:06:08
It's possible to do this, but there aren't any good exchanges on the GBP side for cashing out small amounts.. mostly UK exchanges have bank accounts in eastern europe so to withdraw from them involves an international wire transfer which adds to the fees.. also you're doing two exchanges, BRL to BTC and BTC to GBP.. all things being equal that means 2x as many fees as a single transfer of BRL to GBP.. realistically there are probably better options such as money transfer companies that would do it cheaper and more conveniently, but I don't know of any that work in Brazil off the top of my head and perhaps using BTC as an intermediary wouldn't be a terrible idea in this instance.

Probably every country that hasn't explicitly said that you need a license yet.. if you're looking for legal certainty you probably should look for places that do have relevant licensing.
Incorporation in the UK is very cheap and easy even as a non-resident and a [Bureau de Change registration]( with the regulator is also quite easy to obtain. 
[Hong Kong]( and [Belize]( may also be good options.

Doesn't really protect your anonymity. localbitcoins is hosted behind cloudflare, so they can see where you send your bitcoins when you withdraw them from your wallet, your IP, any plain-text conversation with the counterparty or receipt scan that you might send to them. 
The IP and useragent stuff is probably more than enough to link you to your reddit acct and facebook etc anyway.. you probably signed up using a gmail account which is tied to your real name etc.. basically anyone who claims they're buying bitcoins anonymously has probably fucked up somewhere.
@_date: 2015-04-11 23:13:32
There's [speedybitcoins.co.uk]( and maybe [lazycoins]( [coincorner]( and [cex.io]( are two other options for credit cards but neither are great from a fee perspective. 
Another option is to open a USD or EUR bank account somewhere and move money there through transferwise or currencyfair before forwarding it to one of the main bitcoin exchanges via SWIFT / SEPA. For USD I recommend the [lloyds international account]( you can move money there using currencyfair.com and then send a free SWIFT transfer to a USD bitcoin exchange. There will be a USD deposit fee charged by the exchange and also currencyfair charges a fee but overall this is a very cost effective way to move money out of a UK bank account and into a bitcoin exchange.
for EUR I would not recommend lloyds as their accounts are not part of the SEPA zone, so you don't benefit from the free exchange deposits.. I'm not sure what is a good option for EUR within the UK.. allegedly firstdirect.com has a mainland UK EUR account with reasonable fees but I haven't tried it myself. There actually aren't that many good EUR exchanges right now anyway.. kraken and anxbtc and maybe itbit.. it might be better to go the USD route for the moment anyway.
Another option might be to use a lloyds international GBP account.. just for the free swift transfers.. and use it with coinfloor.. they charge a £5 deposit fee and you don't pay anything for the SWIFT so it's actually fairly efficient too.. the only problem is that coinfloor is often more expensive than other markets.
@_date: 2015-09-01 01:35:15

they're supposed to buy 100% of it.. they don't have a banking license, so operating any kind of fractional reserve is not legal.. as to where they get it, probably on other bitcoin exchanges or from other circle customers who are converting in the other direction.

There is no way to link a UK bank account to any exchange. You can use a visa debit card on coinbase.com though. Other exchanges work by sending outbound SWIFT or SEPA transfers (initiated from your online banking) rather than pulling funds from your account.

UK banks have been closing bitcoin exchange accounts for a long time now.. there's no way coinjar would get banked there. They could do what you suggest in some other country.. maybe somewhere in eastern europe - but that would not be convenient for Australian customers to make deposits.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:45:55
This is probably just someone overvaluing their domain, but domains are actually an ideal way to evade taxes and launder money.. say you have company A that has a pretax profit and wants to move it to company B.. an offshore tax haven entity.. tax haven entity buys a domain for $5 and sells it to company A for $pretax_profit. 
Now the domain brokers provide all the paperwork for you to file on your tax accounts proving a legitimate sale and you've successfully moved your pretax profit to an offshore business entity where it won't be taxed. I think a lot of the strange domain transactions you sometimes see reported are probably because of schemes like this.

coincorner are blowing their opportunity by charging too much imo.
The card fee of 5% is not competitive now that coinbase allows card buys for ~3% - but more importantly their exchange has no liquidity.. they need to address this imo or they might as well just close down.
If you want to buy on coincorner right now their price is £164 - this is actually more than sellers on localbitcoins are charging (~£161) and a full 5.2% above most other exchanges before even adding the additional 5% card fee.
tldr; it costs more than 10% to buy coins on coincorner.
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:09:26

There aren't many good options for the UK but honestly coincorner is not a 'low fee' way to buy BTC.. their market is thinly traded and as a result the lowest offer price is about 6% over bitstamp and if you buy using a credit card they charge a 5% card depsit fee.. in total you're going to be paying an 11% premium.
Normal markups on localbitcoins via faster payments are around 5% and there are currently offers to sell at around 4.3% over bitstamp. 
I wish coincorner the best but currently I would not advise anyone to use their exchange :/

Everyone can always see where the funds go in terms of addresses. That's absolutely necessary otherwise it would be impossible to check whether or not any given key had a spendable balance.
The only thing that isn't publicly known is what other key the stealth address was derived from (has the same private key as). 
This doesn't really provide that much privacy, but for example thepiratebay.org has a bitcoin donation address on their homepage... you can pay their public key but then if someone google's the address they'll know that you paid thepiratebay. 
If you take thepiratebay's public address, generate a stealth address based on it and then pay that - then noone can easily google it and find that you paid thepiratebay. Now.. thepiratebay might move the funds from the stealth address back to their published public address but theoretically the stealth address could still be an unrelated 3rd party that you paid and that then paid thepiratebay.. so still noone knows for sure that you paid thepiratebay..
so yea.. it doesn't do much.. but it may have some use cases.. mainly with static payment addresses on print media I expect. If you have a dynamic website you can just ask for a unique payment address and get pretty much the same level of privacy.

The only asset that can actually exist on a blockchain is an unbacked currency token - simply because it isn't tied to anything in the real world.. no land (like for a land registry).. no unreliable employees (company shares) etc etc. Using the blockchain to administer anything real doesn't really work.. at least not any better than a centralized solution as it relies on the actions of entities that aren't guaranteed to do whatever the blockchain data says.
@_date: 2015-04-16 14:25:57
right.. but say you wanted to deduct more than $1k per year you could make the sale price $150k and if you didn't have the money on hand, you borrow it and then repay it over the same term as the deductions.. basically arrange it so that whatever the deduction is is equivalent to however much tax you don't want to pay.
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:30:59
I believe those addresses are coinbase cold storage. There's this post  where someone accidentally sent 800 BTC to mtgox from coinbase. 
Mtgox returned the money to coinbase.. and it ends up (if you follow the chain) in one of those 66k BTC keys.
Of course it might be coins that coinbase is holding for gox? Who knows.

shapeshift.io is hosted behind cloudflare (like most exchanges). Because of the way cloudflare MITMs the browser connection Cloudflare can see everyone's deposit/withdrawal addresses and link the transactions together.. I consider it very unlikely that LE is not using cloudflare as a wiretap service. I expect they tap the few non-cloudflare using sites too. xmr.to for instance is hosted at amazon.. how hard would it be to tap that? probably not any harder. All these mixing services are probably compromised in some way.

There's certainly no way to do it currently.. theoretically the protocol could be changed to allow it although I doubt such a proposal would ever get the required support. 
There's no way to know if any coins are lost or not.. if you're going to randomly start seizing coins from people that haven't used them in a while that would destroy trust in the system.. 
afaik the only reason some people think lots of coins are lost is because they believe (delusionally imo) that satoshi's hoard is lost.. it almost certainly isn't..

The fees will go up a lot for onchain transactions. most people will migrate their transaction activity off-chain paying smaller fees that bitcoin banks or payment centers aggregate and net against each other and then occasionally commit an expensive blockchain tx to settle between the payment centers.

You need a registered office in the UK but that can be the address of the company formation agent (they will likely charge a fee to forward your mail) if you don't have any other UK address you can use.
The address of the director can be outside the UK - it's supposed to be your real home address.. if you don't want to publish that you can get a 'service address' which can be another mail forwarding type thing - but you still have to tell companies house your real address as well (it just won't be published).
I can't think of any other fees right now but there might be some I guess. You'd probably want to register for VAT as well and I guess there may be some fee for that. Also if you don't pay the VAT on time they may fine you and there are fines for late filing of your annual return as well.. but yea in general it's quite cheap compared to most other jurisdictions.

well.. okpay allows ~~anonymous~~ unverified accounts *I think*.. they don't have banking access, but you could deposit some BTC to okpay to get USD on okpay and then sell the USD on coinffeine.. completely pointless? yes, but coineffine in it's present form is pointless anyway given that okpay has direct BTC integration as well as instant deposits to other anonymous centralized exchanges that probably have better BTC prices than coineffine traders.

There are Manx banks (Isle of Man bank for instance) - but they all clear through the big 4 mainland banks (LLoyds/RBS/HSBC/Barclays I think). Basically even banks that are willing to support bitcoin businesses such as Handelsbank was with Safello - they can't because the clearing banks won't let them. Maybe it could work if everyone who wanted to use an exchange opened accounts at the same bank so that bitcoin transactions are only settled through internal account transfers without going through the clearing banks.

Once the blocks fill up people will have to bid more to get their transactions included.

imo there isn't really much role for blockchains in voting. You still need someone to initially issue/distribute the ballots to people and check that they're eligible, etc. Dead people, fake people or real people ineligible to vote is where the fraud will happen, not in the vote counting.
If you have to trust someone to issue the votes, and you do as there's no way to do that automatically - there isn't really any reason to have a blockchain.. the vote results can just be tallied up in a centralized spreadsheet and published for people to check that their votes were recorded correctly. The names can be anonymized for privacy.

eh. I've seen it when receiving wires.. I dunno about a "source" but if you read up on swift maybe you can find something.. the account owner's name and owner's postal address fields are definitely included in swift payment messages.
edit: It looks like the information is contained in the 50K field of a SWIFT MT103 message. 
From [fintrac](
Although the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) allows its members to choose between three options to fill out tag :50:, i.e., options A, F and K, only options F and K do provide the information that is mandatory for these reports.
so it seems like some financial institutions may still generate payments that don't leak your name and address (ie, using a 50A instead of 50K or 50F field) but probably no banks in the UK would do this and if you tried to pay a bitcoin exchange from such a bank it would probably trigger additional checks anyway. 
This actually also explains why transferwise and currencyfair are not allowed to be used since when you send a wire through those companies the sender's name and address is transferwise or currencyfair - instead of the real sending customer.

bitcoin-qt does not support http proxies. you would need too find something that can bridge between socks and http. ssh can provide a socks server (tunneling the requests to the remote host, provided GatewayPorts is enabled on the remote sshd). You can ssh over an http proxy using corkscrew or some other thing.. there are probably other ways to do this.. in theory it should be possible to have a local socks server that directly makes connections over the http proxy without a remote host being involved as well... 
also it's probably best to talk to your corporate IT people and make sure they're ok with this and maybe they could provide you with a better solution (such as access to a socks proxy, or maybe a dmz host that has actual internet access).
edit: found this; 
edit again: also 
also putty the ssh client can work with outbound http proxies (includnig authentication support) as well as providing an ssh socks proxy locally.. this is probably the easiest thing to get going.
Go to Connection -&gt; Proxy to configure the HTTP proxy part and then go to SSH -&gt; Tunnels and select Dynamic ("Dynamic" is what putty calls SOCKS) and maybe tick the Local ports accept connections from other hosts box if you're running bitcoind on a different host. Then go back to Session and connect to some ssh server on the internet that will forward your connections.

That firstdirect one honestly looks like a good choice.
Other ones I've found are;

[bank of cyprus uk]( -8eur sepa fee - can't recommend as they have absolutely shocking customer service (and only one branch so not very convenient anyway).
[lloyds]( - lloyds international offers eur and usd accounts - on reasonable terms (maintain 2500eur balance or eur 20/mo fee) with free SWIFT transfers. Unfortunately these accounts are issued from the Isle of Man which is outside the SEPA zone. So it's free to send EUR to kraken for example but kraken will charge the 5eur SWIFT receipt fee.. still the overall cost isn't so bad.. but other exchanges might charge a lot more to receive SWIFT than kraken does.
[orwell/ipagoo]( - unclear but probably no fees.. not available just yet but was supposed to be launching this month.

The bitcoin bank could still sell it's loans receivable in order to raise new capital for more loans and thereby leverage up their initial capital.

Circle do not themselves charge fees although the merchant side fees that they incur for processing cards by their bank are added to the payment that they take from your card (the 'processing' fee on the screenshot).

It used to be easier, however there are a few exchange that allow some trading without needing to send scans.. kraken.com allows a fair bit.. of course it isn't in any way anonymous as your name and address is included in the wire transfer.. which brings us to the main issue.. if there are no exchanges in Colombia that offer a good price using local bank transfers then you'll be stuck using a wire anyway so it probably wont be any cheaper than wiring your software provider directly. For small payments it's possible that buying BTC using a credit card could save a bit, but only on small amounts because you're looking at (with usd -&gt; cop conversion) probably over 10% in card fees.. for any significant transfer a wire would be cheaper. Getting rid of coins is far easier.. sell them on localbitcoins for a 25% markup :p
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:33:10
Possibly  - also kraken.com has the same limits for unverified accounts but doesn't accept accounts from most US states (note that your wire transfers contain the address that your bank account is registered too).
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:22:57
It depends where you are.. they aren't licensed as an MSB in any US states but there are three states that don't require one (SC, MT, NM iirc) and they allow customers resident in those states. If you aren't resident there you could probably form an LLC in one of those states and open an account through that.. if you really wanted.
The only way to deposit USD is by wire transfer to Luxembourg.. so it's not really that useful in America even if you could use it. The USD market on kraken only does around 10BTC per day in volume.. it's mainly used by europeans trading on the Euro orderbook.. which you could also use from america but then you're also paying bank foreign exchange fees to convert USD to EUR.. so yea.. basically it's possible to trade there from the US in some circumstances but for most people coinbase or circle are better options.

Well it isn't really possible to send bitcoin by SMS as actually you need a bitcoin address to send too before you can send anything.. you could send a private key and the receiver could sweep it I suppose.
It would be very easy to do inside a centralized wallet service like coinbase or circle  since they can just do an internal account transfer.  I think they already support sending bitcoin by email in that way.. it would be very easy for them to add SMS functionality.. maybe they will do it at some point.
Maybe you could formalize a protocol where one wallet sends an SMS that is actually processed by the receiving wallet asking it to SMS back an address for you to send the BTC too.. basically [BIP70]( over SMS..  I guess all of these things will eventually be done by someone.. how important are they? I dunno really.

It isn't very practical yet.. In the event that you stumble across a bitcoin atm the withdrawal fees will likely be higher than the 3% it would cost to use your normal debit card in an ATM.

That sounds very good. Are you sure they offer euro accounts?
edit: Having looked around their site I cant' find any reference to a euro account. They do offer SEPA but that probably just means they will let you send SEPA transfers from a GBP account - which any bank will do. £4 isn't a bad price for that, but unless you're sending from an EUR account they're probably also going to charge you around 3% in the form of a lousy GBP to EUR conversion.

The exchanges say that they provide a matchmaking service.. so the seller of BTC is actually the counterparty, not the exchange. The exchanges do charge VAT on their exchange fees.. just not on the BTC. In lots of countries private individuals are permitted to sell a certain amount of goods without charging VAT (eg, a yard sale).. so if they sell those via an exchange and it's still them selling it then as long as they're under their limits for selling stuff then it's fine for them to not charge VAT.
It's also possible to buy stuff from an offshore shell company trading on an EU exchange and not owe any VAT since technically the offshore shell company sold it not the exchange. If you arranged your EU exchange such that all EU customers are matched against some kind of offshore trading shell company then I guess that might be fine too.
In addition to those ways, some EU countries tax offices have on their own (not because of any EU legislation) decided not to tax bitcoin sales.. Slovenia (where bitstamp is banked) is one of those and another is the UK (where bitstamp is incorporated). They didn't change the law to do this.. the tax offices (HMRC) and Slovenian ministry of finance just issued guidance saying they won't tax it. This effectively makes it possible for incorporated entities operating in the UK or Slovenia to directly sell BTC (rather than provide a matchmaking service) without charging VAT.
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:02:49
Almost all banks support SEPA but it isn't actually a separate option.. SEPA is really just a SWIFT transfer that meets certain conditions (basically going to/from bank accounts in the SEPA zone and being denominated in EUR).. 
There generally won't be a different form in the online banking to send SEPA transfers (it won't say SEPA anywhere) and often the send fee is the same as regular SWIFT anyway (except for losing another 3% for EUR conversion). 
The only real advantage of SEPA is that the recipient wont get charged a deposit fee (which does happen with regular SWIFT) to receive the money.
Anyone who tells you their bank doesn't support SEPA is almost certainly wrong but it's not surprising that they don't know and yea it doesn't really matter anyway as it's not advantageous for buying BTC.

Forming a bank wouldn't necessarily ensure a bitcoin exchange could access faster payments.. you might get a banking license but that doesn't actually force the other banks to play with you.
Handelsbank was willing to provide a payment account for Safello to operate in the UK but apparently someone told them to stop it.
Finally, if you setup a new bank just to fight this fight and then as you say all the other banks follow suite and start offering accounts to bitcoin exchanges now you've just put yourself out of business as your bank loses it's customer base to the incumbents.

Yes, absolutely. It's a chicken and egg problem.. lots of merchants that have "started accepting bitcoin" have never had one single bitcoin sale.. so while the cost of accepting it may be low there's no material gain in terms of increased business or savings from merchant processing.
Retail staff turnover rates mean that it's likely that even if you do have a few bitcoin customers they will always be served by someone who's never had to do it before.. suddenly that low cost in supporting bitcoin isn't so low anymore as it takes a few min of busy staff time whenever someone asks for it.

I'm just guessing here.. but the reason they want a credit card is an alternate source of funds if it turns out that your bank is empty when they ACH it.. if your alternate source of funds is a debit card attached to the same account then that's obviously going to fail too.

The site acts as an escrow. The buyer commits BTC at the start of the deal and the site can see if you ordered/paid for the item. I'm not sure if that always protects the BTC buyer or not - there might be some edge cases.. but I think the more common case is that people buy the amazon goods with a stolen CC and then the buyer might have to deal with a cop showing up at their door asking why goods bought with a stolen CC were sent to their address. That has happened at least once but it's also fairly unusual.

All the sites mentioned by the OP are cloudflare customers (literally every single one of them is hosted on cloudflare).. as is pastebin.com - so communication difficulties between cantv and cloudflare can easily explain all of this. They've literally gone on TV saying that that's what it was.. come back in a week and if the sites are still unavailable then I'll certainly reconsider my position.

1) Open an EUR market and get an EU (SEPA) bank account. Zero deposit fees are a lot better than USD wire transfer fees.. also now that the US has circle and coinbase very few US users will be interested in international wire transfers.
2) This is something every exchange needs to be doing.. find alternate ways to verify customers that do not involve uploading ID and utility bills. People just don't like it. It's possible to apply for a credit card using online experian credit checks and electoral role checks - the same should be possible with bitcoin exchanges.

The p2p network exists to get transactions from end users to the miners.. but in a p2p way so that anyone can join and leave as an end user or as a mine.. without some centralized list of servers being maintained.. preserving open access.
Some spy sites try to figure out where transactions come from and connect to everyone they can.. the first person who sends them a transaction is presumed to be the origin.. usually this isn't the case but I guess sometimes they get it right.. 
It may be possible to combine this basic who sent it first method with wallet analysis.. associating transactions that look like they all came from keys that are part of the same wallet.. then maybe you can see that a group of transactions is more often observed coming from one IP first.. then even if some transactons come through different IPs you can discard those ones and assume that they really came from the other IP that time too.

all UK banks support SEPA. Generally it costs 3% in fx fees (not an actual fee but they just give you a 3% worse than actual exchange rate) to send or receive Euros from/to a GBP account plus a £10-25 fixed fee to send. Receiving is usually free I think (other than the same roughly 3% fx loss). For small amounts It's actually cheaper to use localbitcoins if there's a decent offer. A typical localbitcoins offer might be around 5% over bitstamp so anything under £500 is going to cost at least 2% (£10 to send) + a 3% fx loss + other fees on the exchange.

Phones already contain NFC elements.. unfortunately I think normal non-OS apps don't get enough access to them to do payments.. but if that were to change - the hardware is capable.. then a centralized wallet/exchange could sell some BTC and load it into a temporary single use visa/mastercard/diners/amex number and the phone could present that to the merchant over NFC. The user experience would be basically paying with the coinbase app at any merchant that takes NFC cards (which will soon be everywhere).

Have you actually done it yet? Are they sending the withdrawal as GBP or as EUR? If they're sending EUR barclays will take ~2.5% of it on arrival. You can do the same thing on kraken for only a 0.09EUR SEPA withdrawal fee, so cubits is nothing special if that's what they're doing. You can do essentially the same thing on any EUR exchange that has SEPA withdrawals.
If they're actually sending GBP then I agree that's a good price. For comparison kraken's GBP SWIFT withdrawls are 0.19% with a £10 minimum and coinfloor charges a flat rate £10 per transfer.
You almost certainly would not be able to send a wire to cubits for EUR0.90.. most UK banks charge from £10-25 for GBP SWIFT wires.
It has always been possible to access foreign bitcoin exchangse with SEPA and SWIFT wire transfers from most UK bank accounts.. the problem is the fees.

The fees aren't relative to the size of the payment in terms of money. It would still cost roughly the same amount to send more money. The payment is determined by the size (in data) of the payment message and other factors like how recently the money was last moved (eg, to prevent spam, moving the same money lots of times is penalized by requiring a higher fee). You could also chose not to pay the fee.. the payment would probably still eventually be processed although it might take a day or two.

I assume some enterprising businessmen would import the cards from somewhere and also arrange to fund them for cash, but I'm merely guessing. While Iran is cut off from SWIFT I don't think that actually stops them sending international wires - it probably just means they have to use a fax machine or phone or some other electronic? mechanism to instruct the payments.
Apparently the Iranian ATM/debit card network is linked to the ones in Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait so they can actually just withdraw money from their Iranian accounts in those countries or vice versa.. if they had a Kuwaiti account they could access it from inside Iran via an ATM and of course make SWIFT payments from it since Kuwait is still connected to SWIFT.

merchants don't generally accept bitcoin either, they accept bitpay. bitpay has said they don't plan to support litecoin, but if that were to change litecoin would instantly share almost as much acceptance as bitcoin.. same goes if bitpay adopt any other cryptocurrency.. just how tennable is the 'only bitcoin' policy when many more potential customers have altcoins and are pestering the merchants to support them? how long before bitpay relents or starts losing market share to some new payment processor that does take altcoins? Acceptance of altcoins is likely to be a feature of any new startup entering this space as it's a fairly easy feature to support and the incumbant doesn't have it.
litecoin growth is still quite strong.. if it continues in 3 months there will be more people holding 1LTC than 1BTC (and perhaps even holding 4LTC than 1BTC) at that point depending on how you look at things litecoin will have overtaken bitcoin.. of course bitcoin will probably still have a larger market cap, but people will probably have to at least start questioning how this is justifiable - especially when most of the fiat to drive that valuation comes from people buying small fractions of a bitcoin.. they could just buy a whole litecoin instead and get a larger piece of the action.. sure the actual price of the units is irrelevant but the percentages are not.
Of course after a lot of money has moved into litecoin this process will probably repeat with some other altcoin. I guess it might not be litecoin that moves first either could be some other one will jump to second place, but so far it seems like litecoin could be the next one to move. In any case I think it's unlikely that any of the current coins will remain on top for very long although they may all continue to enjoy some usage for a while.

I don't think any of the banks will close your account for sending or receiving money from the exchanges. The problem is that there are no exchanges with UK bank accounts.. that means the only way to send money is via international wire transfer out of the UK. That generally costs at least £10 per transfer.
You didn't say where you're from, but if it's in the US or EU you're better off keeping and using your existing bank account to buy BTC. You can send funds to your existing account using transferwise.com and then forward them to an exchange. It will be cheaper.

It's not allowed, and it probably won't work. Coinbase doesn't actually bill the card unless your bank account debit gets rejected. Your debit card is no good because it's assumed to be linked to the same (empty) bank account and thus not useful as a backup funding source.

bitcoin has had 4+ years and still almost nobody uses it.. the adoption rate seems to be fairly constant too (ie, no signs of it going viral *yet*).. Very few people have any bitcoins and if some of the large holders cashed out the resulting butthurt from the collapse in price might dampen general enthusiasm for the concept. Perhaps not though.. volatility attracts mad speculators.. cryptocurrency is here to stay but bitcoin might never scale up to the financial importance of gold or even a significant fraction of it.. I think Schiff "gets it" more than most of his detractors.. he may turn out to be wrong though.
One thing that does concern me is what happens when the next cryptocurrency trumps bitcoin..? Bitcoin was supposed to avoid this by having superior network effects, but these seem to have so far failed to materialize.. I don't think it would be at all difficult for some other cryptocurrency to overtake bitcoin in terms of users simply because there are so few of us.. on the merchant side bitpay has so far refused to adopt other altcoins, but if that were the only thing preventing competition it's not much to rely on.. certainly other payment providers will, and most likely bitpay will eventually too.. even without that, it probably wouldn't be very difficult to make a altcoin&lt;-&gt;bitcoin gateway and browser plugin to instantly enable altcoin payments on all bitpay sites even without their permission, similar to what people are making to enable bitcoin payments on fiat only sites.
If bitcoin is open to competition (which seems almost inevitable to me) it casts serious doubt on it's ability to reach some of the lofty valuations that have been suggested.. if more people come to this conclusion it may lead to some early hoarders selling out.
