Great time to buy silver. Go to r/silverbugs

You remind me of all the people that dismissed claims the government was monitoring people. It was all dismissed as tinfoil hat conspiracy bullshit... until we learned the government was spying... on EVERYBODY on the face of the planet.

Was the law of the kand for 42 years. Could be again in a second with the stroke of a pen.
@_date: 2014-08-09 22:12:04
Fuck the r/government.

False. It takes an act of congress to go to war. If a president declared war on a state the shit would hit the fan.

Fuck the central bank of Bangladesh. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:25:54
Too late?

It's not a conspiracy if it has been proven to be true.

I.guess it was repealed in 1975, but all it takes is a stroke of a pen. At the time this happened americans were literally robbed of their gold by the US Government to pay off the private bankers.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:37:35
Fuck New Jersey. That place is the biggest piece of shit in the US.
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:24:10
Legally you can't even own gold in the US. It can be seized at any time.
@_date: 2014-11-12 04:16:21
Thank you kind sir!

The point is they infiltrate social media and blogs (this includes reddit). It doesn't need to specifically mention bitcoin. The reason they would though is bitcoin is a threat to the global banking empire. If their source of wealth and power is threatened, they will do anything to undermine the threat.

I'm guessing OP.

Florida sucks too!
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:08:51
Yeah it has. It's  called counterfeiting.
@_date: 2015-05-28 01:42:18
America is a lie, and the people that believe it are fucking morons. Our representatives are all giant sacks of shit.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:10:11
Happy cakeday!
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:22:07
It can be.

He needs to get in the middle of the circle...

Same with many pharmaceuticals. Lots of them have terrible cure rates. Some lower than placebo.  Again showing the cure is sometimes worse than doing nothing.
@_date: 2015-04-02 01:36:03
Fuck that. Money is speech, that is blocking my free speech. This will get thrown out.

Proper nutrition and exercise go a long way to counteract genetics. Google epigenetics, you can actually change what genes are being expressed through proper nutrition.

As opposed to the federal government who actually have people killed.
@_date: 2015-04-30 01:22:36
10 years from now when bitcoin skyrockets someone is going to come home and find a hole in their wall...
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:07:58
You're not supposed to break down like that from old age. That's our shitty diet and poor physical fitness doing that.
@_date: 2015-03-27 23:17:08
Government agencies aren't always known for their competency...TSA, ATF, DEA, the list goes on.

The fall of the dollar is coming and when it does we are screwed. Just like britain was when british sterling was no longer the base currency. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:12:39
That's the UK, they are just serfs there anyway.
