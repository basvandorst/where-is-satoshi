Why are you paying 8$ for your transaction? You're not doin it right you should be paying a fee in bits! 
Why do you think we need to continue to reward miners at the current rates? they can make less, no big deal, they can mine something else, are you a miner? I am and you've gota understand a lot of miners aren't in just it for the money, there's some love there to. Not that blocks have much to do with that.  ...And by the way you still will use the network even at those hypothetical rates. Compare it to the 12 pound fee I have to pay to deposit foreign checks at my bank. Have you made a swift payment lately $25+ +!

so can we just hit the link and print these?
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:37:17
agree, but as a miner I'm saying why do I still need to be getting paid so well, its only going to heart my wallet balance, , not the network

People need to use bitcoin transparency features for theme to work!
@_date: 2015-06-09 09:33:24
Agree, if blocks fill up to much, less people use or transact bitcoins, blocks dont fill up so much, it equalises

Print a bitcoin wallet, with the code incrypted by a password, laminated it, duct tape it to yourself, jump on a boat, sorted.
Or better still tattoo the encrypted private code to yourself.

Both LN and larger blocks are both likely necessary at some stage. The order and timing in which they are implemented was the important consideration. We will get both soon, as devlopers have written in their game plan with segwit. Calm is the new cool.

@_date: 2016-01-01 23:54:15
Short time scale is not so relevant. When mining bitcoin in a smaller pool the payout is larger when a block is found, so there is no real insentive to go with the large pool. That is besides getting a payout in time for your next power bill or drug addiction and thats just silly.

@_date: 2015-08-19 07:06:39
Agree, but bitcoin is not currently closed to mainstream adoption and talking about misterious forks when people struggle technically already is off putting for them.

Its all in the interest and bond rates, when your greece and they go to 11% it hurts, when you're rates are next to zero like in japan, debt becomes close to unlimited. Rates are a reflection of reputation and reputation is. .. transient and comparative . Ie if bitcoin is percieved as a safer haven than bonds then government debt rates go up

I cant tell if this is for or against. Its just some grumpy dumb guy

@_date: 2015-11-03 17:21:33
Lol. When bloomberg says it will be 400 hundred in a year it hits that price within the day, its pretty obvious because just a fraction of those readers entering the market is enought to move the price that far. Bitcoin is still about one tenth of uber in market cap so 400 is not high really, also considering also its not a company
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:40:02
It depends if they are fractionally reserving the fiat or some how the bitcoin, anyways off topic. Why don't we all just agree to pump?

Beats the pants off the old dolar a day charity campainge
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:44:08
A fractional reserve would reduce the price, last bubble was speculative hype, but we are not at that level yet and we do have more users

Last time the price started going up like this, it did group and down wildly, but it surprised to the upside over and over again. There was the OMG the bitcoin price went up again moment, then the next day you looked it had gone up twice as much again. Then you buy cause you feel your stupid for not. Mass media report on the price all time highs, then the price hits the top of the spike the next week. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:32:27

What you do is put a public key on the item. This adress has a small amount of say bitcoin on it. This is like a rabate. So when you scan the code with your phone You can see if its there or not. When you buy the item, you email the manufacturer with the public key and the receipt, and your bitcoin address public key) or bank account for payment.

Well if you bought the fastest super computer in the world Taine-2. Then comissioned 100 more of them and had them online for the halving in 2016 you might do it. Seriously we are at 350 peta hashes and I dont even have my miners on! Anyone heard of boinc? No not realy, its only got 20 petaflops.
