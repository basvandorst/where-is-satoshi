Moore's Law has something to do with it.

He's the only person I've heard explain Bitcoin eloquently. There must be others but he's the only one I've come across. 
You can tell he has done a hell of a lot of work understanding the intricacies of the system (technically and socially) and all of the systems it will eventually impact. He is then able to use interesting anacdotes that are relatable to a layman as a way to help explain the eventual impact. To say he is contibuting nothing is pure nonsense. 
Also, as far as I know the book he is promoting is downloadable for free as a .PDF 
Why you mad?

I'm not sure why it was first planned to be implemented, but I think it was to fix transaction malleability. Lighting was not able to be implemented in the way it was initially designed without this fix. Another benefit of segwit was that it effectively increased the blocksize. And if I'm not mistaken, there was the added bonus that covert ASIC Boost could not be used alongside it.

I think you're missing the point. 
The idea is that people choose this option to help them save. It's not about forcing anybody to do anything.

I don't know how accurate this stereotype.
They have a real reason to believe in the technology. Bitcoin benefits the Chinese middle and upper class much more than it does the majority of their western counterparts. I'm not sure how the lower class perceive it. 
The CCP has strict currency controls, and it's hard to send money abroad. So the decentralised, censorship resistant nature of Bitcoin is a real selling point. 
And of course, there are more than a billion of them. So even if a minority of Chinese bitcoiners are interested in the tech, it's still a significant number.

Me too. And the mention of Ethereum during the 3rd appearance was what got me into Ethereum.
