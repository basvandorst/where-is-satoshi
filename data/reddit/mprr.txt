I don't believe I've mentioned Open Whisper Systems at all in this thread, let alone spammed for them. That being said, I do believe that the software produced by Open Whisper Systems—being completely open source—is a better alternative to Telegram or any other closed source messaging software that claims to be secure.


One of Bitcoin's core principals is having no trust requirement, something that cannot be said of Telegram or any other closed source software.

I feel your pain :p
That's actually something that the Sparkassen more or less have in common with Barclays: Go one county/city away and you can't deposit money or get account statements.

That's great, but does nothing to address the comment you are replying to.

* Telegram's source code cannot be reviewed by the community.
* The user must trust Telegram to use sound cryptography and to not contain any vulnerabilities.
* The user must trust Telegram to actually encrypt messages in such a way that only the sender and the recipient  can read them.
* The user must trust Telegram to not introduce any backdoors at behest of the government.
None of the above is subject to opinion. The above are facts, objectively verifiable.
Telegram already **is** the mainstream model. It's no better than Skype or any of the other examples I've mentioned in another comment. It just happens to come from a smaller company that successfully markets toward the part of the population that has become concious of their lack of privacy on the internet but lacks the knowledge to know that Telegram offers no improvements in practice.

Perhaps, but said the risk department of his bank cancelled the transaction, not that the transaction couldn't be processed somewhere down the road. Even if the local banks all use the same banks (Landesbanken) and by extension the Raiffeisen Zentralbank to route transactions, they nevertheless remain independent in their ability to create their own policies.
~~RZB has a majority stake in the Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI), but RBI is not involved in the processing of transactions of local Raiffeisenbanks to my knowledge.~~ I overlooked that OP is in Bulgaria. In that case, Raiffeisen Bank International most likely *is* the local branch, so of course they *are* involved in processing his transaction :-)

That's incorrect, although I can understand the confusion. Barclays PLC, which is headquarted in London, has a majority stake in the Barclays Africa Group, which serves Nigeria. So while technically Barclays in Nigeria is not the same as Barclays PLC in London, Barclays PLC does have control of the former and can dictate its policy for all practical purposes.
Sparkassen, on the other hand, are usually owned by the city or county in which they are active, with only a handful being privately owned. Raiffeisenbanks are generally owned by their members and are similar to credit unions in the USA.
To touch upon my earlier example, Sparkasse Berlin and Sparkasse Hamburg aren't controlled by the same parent corporation that could force both of them to block Bitcoin-related transactions. In contrast, Barclays PLC could definitely instruct Barclays Africa Group to institute such a ban.

Do you mean people that point out suspected vote manipulation when they see it or do you mean people that explain why Telegram is not a solution if you want secure communications? Or do you perhaps mean people that can reason and don't have to delete their comments when they get called out?
I have yet to see anyone in this thread refute the technical arguments brought forth against Telegram. All you and the other supporters of Telegram have managed to respond are personal attacks and what essentially amounts to "Don't worry about how insecure it is. Look at how many *users* it has!".
Maybe you should have taken out a banner ad somewhere instead of posting to reddit if you just want everybody to just look at your pretty screenshot and move on.

Using TransferWise would cost a total of 1% and family won't be forced to register with a Bitcoin exchange, which they may not want to. This is cheaper than sending the money by wire and most likely also cheaper than paying fees to two Bitcoin exchanges, not even taking into account the risk of losing more money to the spread between Bitcoin exchanges or volatility.
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:25:57


So we're in agreement then? :-)
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:18:40
I was going off of these two documents, but what you say is plausible and might apply to OP, too, of course:
- 
- 


I agree and I think another third-party solution (e.g. TransferWise at 1% true cost) is preferential to both using Bitcoin as well as using a wire transfer.


I *highly* doubt that. I have not yet seen any consumer bank that offers its customers rates that are even close to market, neither in the US nor in Europe. For that reason I think spending the USD in India with a debit or credit card would be similarly expensive to using a wire transfer, even if the card provider ostensibly doesn't charge a fee.
Unfortunately I don't think it's possible to verify either of our claims as Chase doesn't seem to publish the exchange rates they offer online.
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:41:48
Chase charges business accounts $40 for international USD wires and $45 for international wires in foreign currency. I couldn't find any price information for consumers, but it's safe to assume that the rates for them are equal o. That is also in line with what other banks charge for wires.
While a fee of even $40 would probably be acceptable at only 0.2%, banks generally offer such bad spreads to their customers that it can be considered another, if hidden, fee. In my experience the size of the spread that banks offer is generally around 2% to 5%.

It may be encrypted, but that doesn't mean it's secure, which is probably what your aiming at with your question (or at least it's the question that you should be asking). That's the one big problem with Telegram, Threema and all the other "secure" messenger applications that popped up in light of the Snowden revelations: They're all closed source.
Skype uses encryption. Facebook uses encryption. Google Talk/Hangouts uses encryption. And not a single one of them is secure in the sense that only the sender and recipient may read and write messages.
@_date: 2015-07-24 18:49:13
Of course they are, I merely wanted to point out something I found suspicious. I suspect that at least some of the accounts may have motives for commenting other than just sharing software they happen to like. Naturally, I may be wrong, and everybody is welcome to draw his or her own conclusions.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:17:21


That's misrepresenting the situation quite a bit. Here's why:
There are nearly 500 **independent** Raiffeisenbanken in Austria alone, with more than 300,000 organisations using the "Raiffeisen" name worldwide. While they may share the same name and logo and cooperate in many regards, they are autonomous and do not report to the same board.
So when you say that you "just got a call from your banker in Raiffeisen Bank", you make it sound like **all** Raiffeisenbanken are blocking Bitcoin-related transactions, which simply can not be deduced from a single bank making that decision.
Sparkassen behave in a similar manner: There are Sparkassen in Germany, Austria and even Italy, but they are independent from one another even within the same country. So while Sparkasse Hamburg may try to prevent Bitcoin-related transactions, Sparkasse Vienna might not care.

At the time of this writing, the file `Electrum-2.3.3.tar.gz`, which contains Electrum's source code, is identical on both sites.
The standalone Windows executables `electrum-2.3.2.exe` differ from one another, however. I'd assume that the binaries on the imposter site are malicious.
As it's a bad idea to execute software from unknown sites in general I didn't bother to investigate any further or compare other files.

Whether or not one can call whatever Telegram uses "strong crypto" is debatable. Several cryptographers seem to disagree and argue that Telegram uses outdated algorithms in an insecure construct. See the following, for example:
* 
* 
* 
That doesn't mean that the local storage *doesn't* have issues, of course.


The assumption that there are more valuable targets than a user's chat history on his phone does not make Telegram any more or less secure and consequently it is not a valid argument in this debate. The comment you are replying to literally says "Just don't tell anybody [Telegram] is secure".


How do you know that messages can only be read on a user's phone? How do you know that Telegram can't look at the messages, especially if end-to-end encryption is disabled, as it is by default?


How Julia authenticates with Coinbase has **nothing at all** to do with Telegram, the messaging part of the construct, so why are you even comparing it with WhatsApp? That being said, WhatsApp integrates the same recognised end-to-end encryption that TextSecure uses and does not use plain text in transit.


I am not aware of Tor being "hacked" by anyone. Of course that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Could you expand on what you mean or provide some sources for that claim?
In any case, I don't understand your argument. Are you claiming that because one piece of software was broken we should stop striving for security in all others and just assume that our software is broken and give up? If so, Telegram may be just right for you in that case!


Arguing is literally what Reddit is for, among other things.


What is patch 68? I was only able to find a ten year old security alert 68 from Oracle, so perhaps you meant something else? I'm sure others reading this comment would feel the same way, so please expand.
Again: Other targets being more vulnerable or perhaps containing more valuable data is **not** a valid argument in favour of Telegram's supposed security. I've already addressed that point above.


His original concern was that Telegram, which is a requirement to use Julia, is insecure and should not be advertised to potential users as such. You have done nothing to respond to that claim.

My "objective" in this thread was to point out a suspicious comment pattern I noticed and to make anyone considering giving Telegram a try aware of the fact that Telegram can not be considered secure despite what its developer claims.
How you think you were able to infer that I'll "find fault with any objective other than my own" or that I am "too lazy to do anything" from that alone is beyond me.


To the contrary! How secure Telegram is (or not) is *the* point, considering that that's one of its main selling points. From their FAQ: "Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security."
I think consumers increasingly want to be able to communicate securely and in private. Telegram advertises that ability, but its closed nature makes it inherently insecure and consumers deserve to know that. Its effect on Bitcoin adoption is secondary to that in my opinion.


Who says I don't? Air gapped systems are one of the simplest and most effective ways to isolate sensitive information :-)

I'd like to encourage anyone reading this thread to take a look at the history (or lack thereof) of the commenters praising this app. Some of them created Reddit accounts just to comment on this thread (while others (have only used their account to advertise Gems/Julia and their virtues.
