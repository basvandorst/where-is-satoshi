I feel like more and more podcasts and bitcoin positive articles are making their way to the masses and people are starting to share btc with friends to get them started!
and of course r/bitcoin reaching more people = more to read about btc!
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:28:32
thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:31:42
I'll give it a shot

I feel like its just a matter of time before 3D printers are in every home.
--&gt; place an order on amazon with Bitcoin. Amazon loads your purchase blueprints into your 3D printer... it prints out your stuff.

@_date: 2014-05-11 01:35:26
I can't wait to gather up enough to get my first full bitcoin!
fun times indeed!!

this place just gets cooler and cooler!

Let Green man gaming compare people that pay them cash to voice their hate of bitcoin
People who tip them with bitcoin to promote bitcoin
I bet btc is already winning, lol.
I'm not suggesting we pummel them with any more btc, I'm sure the tips they've gotten from total strangers already is very encouraging
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:45:35
I just tipped the game company asking about btc for gaming on twitter
 
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:55:19
hahaha what a great thread!
totally  turned my day around, thank you! LOL
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:07:33
this has a lot of great potential! very cool concept!
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:05:53
Huzzuh! time to visit San Diego!
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:31:54
thank you!

I've been asking when ever I get the check, or am at a cash register to pay for things at a store. 
Planting the suggestion like a seed to work it's way up the chain.
"What is this bitcoin that people keep asking about?"
"hrmmmm... lets call the head office and find out."
@_date: 2014-05-11 04:24:02
great mix!

Being in game dev for a number of years and watching games skyrocket once micro-transactions are implemented , I feel like social networking would see a huge boost (not that it needs one) from btc tipping.
I certainly feel the extra layer of excitement, sharing, and camaraderie in reddit now that I've finally taken the plunge into btc.
Well played tippers and appreciators
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:13:33
on it! :)
This is something I've been waiting to happen.

You can't find banks all over the world, but nearly everywhere you go people have phones!
This is a great idea!
Get people posting updates about their life and get btc tips/donations!
Encourage communication through donations directly to the source rather than getting filtered through a business first!
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:59:15
I think that btc would take gaming into a modern landslide of popularity. 
People are so into virtual 'game' money, why not change that to btc and take out the middleman of buying fake money and get right into something awesome!
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:26:02
These topics are what pushed me into the comfort zone of starting gathering up bits to build my first bitcoin!
Nice read!
@_date: 2014-05-10 05:04:03
haha this should be a tshirt
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:18:50
lol. right?! but they do get smaller and smaller
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:16:35
soooo... just keep generating and checking until you win?
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:28:06
ending a workweek with bitcoining is not a bad thing at all!
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:54:00
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:21:09
Exciting! Gratz! I'm working on this as well! 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:49:16
thank you! heehee
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:23:56
Thank you!
I've been using tips to add friends to the community!
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:56:48
The bits I get, I've been forwarding to friends that aren't into btc yet! 
But they are now! mwuhuhahahaaaa... 
Fun times! Thank you tippers!!!
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:36:02
I got my neighbor this time! o,0
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:04:58
Huzzuh! and thank you!
... i'm nearly to 1000bits (from tips) to gift a friend and get them into btc as well! 
This will be the 3rd person I've brought into the fold, mwuhuhuhahahahaaaa...
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:15:56
I'll give this a try being I just got into bitcoin yesterday!
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:26:56
Thank you! :)
I agree! patting people on the back with hard earned btc and promoting socializing and getting people excited about communicating is a great thing!
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:56:29
thank you!! :)
