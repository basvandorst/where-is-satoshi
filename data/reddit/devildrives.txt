Supply and demand. The market is you, I, and BTC. Truthfully, no money has intrinsic value. Actual gold doesn't even have intrinsic value. It only has perceived value. That perception is one of faith. You choose to give BTC it's value when you believe it has value. Just like a dollar. It's not really different from other paper. Except, people believe it has value. So... It becomes valuable.

Whether it's an iou or not, it's still called a dollar. It's got a percieved value and it's used as a medium of exchange. If it takes a digital form, it exists in a digital environment. I understand the monetary system pretty well. I don't use a dollar as a personal IOU. I use it to pay off my personal debts. 
The biggest difference between BTC and the dollar is what you mentioned. The value of a dollar is heavily controlled by the central bank. Where as BTC is controlled by an algorithm and the blockchain ledgers. Also unlike the dollar, it's value seems to be heavily influenced by market speculation. Trading dollars on Forex doesn't lead to the same volatility as BTC. Which leads me to be skeptical of it's real value. The possibility of it being a bubble, is fairly high.

If you think you can even come close to an accurate prediction, you haven't watched the fluctuations over the past month. Hell, you must have missed the last 24 hours. BTC is a meth head in a hobby shop.

It's a form of capital, is it not? Specifically, financial capital, right? Therefore, it's very alike to the dollar. You can use it as a payment in many stores, just like a dollar. The majority of dollars in the worlds economy exists in digital form. I swipe a card to pay for most things. That's a digital payment. I use a card to pay online. That's also a digital payment. I have faith that people will continue to accept the dollar as a form of payment. Therefore, it will continue to be valuable. The things you think give it inherent value, are not valuable unless you continue to have faith that it will be accepted by others as a form of payment. 
Yes, some of it's properties differ from the dollar. I can't put a dollar in a quarter slot. Does that mean it's a fallacy to compare a dollar to a quarter?

I wasn't sure if he was describing banks or BTC. The value of all money is pulled out of thin air. And didn't Doiche bank just get busted for laundering along side that other bank financing terrorists. He's just mad cause the gov. can't take a cut with fines.

Taking out loans you can't afford makes you culpable. Giving out loans you know they can't afford makes you capable too. It's not contradictory-just complex. 
Big problems are often a culmination of multiple screw ups by multiple parties.

Don't fret. Market corrections ensure steady, long term growth, instead of volatility. We want a dependable alternative to the dollar. Not an unreliable rollercoaster.

You are your own worst enemy. Stop selling it. All financial value is only as real as long as people have faith in it's value. You are the reason for price drops.

Their "job" is to be a central bank. Which is a private organization that only ensures market stability to the extent of it's own self-interest. It issues money in the form of loans and collects the interest on those loans. The interest rates effect the rates of inflation more than the markets themselves. Markets are driven primarily by the consumers or "investors". The money disappeared because both people and banks didn't have enough money to pay for the loans. The people defaulted and the banks defaulted due to fractional reserve banking. It was fraud on a grand scale. The federal reserve is responsible for the fractional reserve aspect of the banks going bust. The consumers were responsible for real estate going bust. Stock markets crashed as a domino should, when the economy takes a swan dive into the abyss.

They didn't "lose 9 trillion dollars". The economy essentially dropped it's own market cap by about 10.2 trillion dollars.
 
It's what happens when an over-valued market goes bust.

I wasn't able to find the Bloomberg article Mr. Grayson was referencing. However, I will echo that the specific Bloomberg article is not what's most important about the video. The video was filmed in may of 2009, and Mr. Grayson was referencing the federal reserves lending practices from the previous year. It's definitely the same thing I was referencing. 
I believe the OP was eluding to the "bubble" that some people believe BTC to currently in. I believe OP is implying that BTC doesn't have a market cap that can compare to the central banks market cap. The Federal Reserve has a market cap that would be earth shattering if it were to burst. The monetary market system can collapse, just like any other market.

The market cap is only 154 billion. So... It appears that you haven't got a clue.
