If there were ten people, and 8 of them decided to rob the other 2. By definition the majority wouldn't have a problem with it. However it still doesn't change the fact that it's theft. 


That's one alternative. Another alternative is to remove taxes for the poorest and reduce government.


Usually by using violence.


Not if government was smaller, efficient, and competitive. Like private sector businesses must be.


Firstly it's an unproven theory that poor people would suffer. It's more likely that society as a whole would benefit from smaller government and no income tax.
Is it your position that theft and violence can be justified if poor people might suffer? That's not a basis for a fair and equitable society.

It's not a voluntary exchange. If you don't pay, men with guns will take your assets and put you in jail.
The principal is similar to this scenario: If someone threatens you with violence to get your money it's considered a crime. If two people do it, it's still a crime. ... where do you draw the line. If 1,000,000 do it, is it still a crime?

If OP is being truthful. These are the facts:
* OP did not re-enter his seed.
* OP's seed was not self-generated. It was generated during the initial Trezor setup, two years ago.
* Seed was written on a piece of paper and has never been photographed or typed into a computer.
* OP used pin and passphrase. 
* Passphrase was numeric only.
* Hardware is Trezor One with firmware 1.8.3. 
* OP is using an Apple iMac computer.
* Chrome with Trezor Bridge extension installed.
* Chrome extension for Trezor Version 1.2.7.
* Firmware was updated shortly before receiving 5.63 BTC.
* OP verified firmware checksum on the Trezor during the update.
* When the Trezor was not being used it was stored in a safe-deposit box.
* OP states his browser history does not contain typo phising domains, only the genuine [trezor.io]( site.
* The suspect transaction happend 8 hours, 45 minutes and 29 seconds after OP's legitimate transactions.
* The Trezor was not connected to the computer when the transaction occured.
* Only OP and his wife have physical access to the Trezor.
* OP trusts his wife, and stated she doesn't know about crypto.
* OP is from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
**Possible Scenarios**
1. When you originally set up the Trezor you stored the seed on your PC somewhere, then you forgot about it (It was two years ago, and people forget).
2. The firmware upgrade somehow leaked your seed. The hacker then brute-forced your passphrase.
3. The attacker has a key-logger on your PC and got your passphrase that way. 
4. A rouge browser extension slipped in an extra transaction. You clicked OK on the Trezor by mistake when confirming the legitimate transaction. The transaction's details were sent back to the attacker, who published it \~8 hours later.  
Assume you computer is compromised. Wipe the storage and re-install the OS.

Fiat is a ponzi where early borrowers of fiat money are paid out by later investors. And all fiat holders get screwed.
@_date: 2019-09-15 06:47:38
To survive, both the Ponzi scheme, and the fractional reserve bank scheme require that most investors/depositors will not ask for their money to be returned at the same time. 
Think about it. With a 100% reserve bank, any loan would require a portion of depositor's funds to be "locked"   
 until the loan is repaid. 
The only way banks can loan money, and still give depositor's free access to their funds is because they are only required to keep a fraction of all the depositor's funds.

You're missing the point. The Currency (Restrictions on the Use of Cash) Bill 2019 defines cash as physical cash and **digital currency (i.e. bitcoin).**
It restricts many bitcoin transactions to the $10,000 limit. The same as physical cash.
The new law isn't just about physical cash, it includes bitcoin. Until that is removed from the bill, we must assume it stands as written. Forget the preamble where the treasurer may or may not exempt some digital currency transactions.

There's a lot of real estate sellers who accept crypto as an alternative payment option for either full or part payment. They still use conveyancers, and trust accounts. 


No, it's not "most likely" undeclared income. A friend of mine purchased a house using bitcoin as a partial payment. It saved him from going through an exchange and moving money internationally through the banking system. In his country there is no capital gains taxes on crypto, so he wasn't avoiding taxes, it was simply more convenient.  
You're obviously a bit of a 'wanker' to assume people who use crypto are automatically guilty of some tax crime.  
FYI - It's "who's" (contraction of who is), not "whos". Sentences start with capitals. Perhaps you're still "reaping the benefits" from your public education.

That statement assumes that the Chinese government are efficient and organised. They don't know where all the bitcoin miners are located, it may take them months or years to discover them all and shut them down. 
It also missed the fact that miners will move their equipment out of China into other countries. Probably at the first sign of trouble they'll start moving equipment.
