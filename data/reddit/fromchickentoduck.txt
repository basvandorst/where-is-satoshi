Congrat for your 0.1 BTC. It will make you surprise coming time. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:12:46
Good option guy. Best luck to you that you will double this amount by that time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:54
Congrat, you could get big in some next days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:41:39
Ha ha ha absolutely true. Weeks later people would cry when it skyrocket again. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:37
I believe that the big boys/whales short most of their BTC and altcoins together to make this dip. Then they would by back next year when the BTC down below 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:09:18
You should have some drink, then go to bed. Tomorrow will be fine.
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:35:17
Should we sell now or 6 hours later?
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:01:13
And then it would not go up then he thinks it would go down and up and down...
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:44:04
If Mt.Gox sell all of his bitcoin (which is 1.9B$ at this moment), the price will crash to 1k$ for sure. Fucking Mt.Gox
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:47:35
BTC will hit 12k$ today or tomorrow. Welcome 12k again.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:07:13
HODL means Hold for the Dear Life.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:18:00
Buy now or be sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:20:10
So I will wait at $ 1.1 and all-in.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:02:41
FUDs come and go then FOMOs come and go. That's simply HODL.
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:30:02
Can be 7k-6k-5k-...-1k$. Who knows!
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:35:15
And then very very strong support at $300
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:22:09
You will need to wait for very long time to see it back to 8k...
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:25:07
How do you know the bottom man? We can only know the bottom when it's already over.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:13:11
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:06:12
Does anyone have any ideas why the BTC drop right now?
It seems some whales start to dump the BTC again.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:04:13
Buy the dip buy the dip buy the dip...
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:39:39
ha ha then it can be crash another 50%
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:22:49
If it dip again into 7k, will you buy it? Or you are still FUD and then when it back to 15k you again with for the dip?
Buy now and HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:18:31
Yeah! then soon at 8000, 7000, 6000....
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:20:43
The Chinese guys come back from long holiday, they see the btc price up almost double from the bottom 6.5k$ last two weeks then they take profit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:25:59
Can you tell me more detail about the India FUD? Indian gov wants to ban Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:08:20
Very good job Captain FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:46:42
Yes, it seems media try to make people FUD.
Let's buy the dip now or you are sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:02:10
So what? Hodl or No?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:33:13
Please sell all your btc now and we will see the btc to the moon. Pleaseeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:38:11
FOMO started
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:10:48
What is this? Can you explain more detail?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:24:04
Are you ready to buy the dip?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:10:46
Ok understand! Some times media try to make people FUD. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:55:28
Good bye $8k, it’s $9k now and ready go back to $10k.
Do you want to miss this skyrocket to the MOON?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:31:19
It is going to 13k$ this week.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:27:11
Back to 10k$ already, you will have a good profit in March.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:57:20
Well done American. You made a good pump.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:55:49
Better to buy now. Btc is going to dump to 13k within next week.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:18:11
Very good strategy.
Btw, please let us know when you buy.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:20:20
TA should not work well for crypto/BTC. The better way is to buy the dip and HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:17:23
If it goes to 7K I will buy, no need to wait until 6k
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:43:49
9k$ is coming soon...
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:00:47
The what Fuck???
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:38:55
It seems that 8k$ now is the reasonable price for btc for this time until we have new money to FOMO.
