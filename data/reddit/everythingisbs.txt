Your replies have restored my faith in this sub. Now the question is how to spot the burst, especially now that there are shorting opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:22
Yeah I kind of did just mean btc. Sorry, this post was really mostly just about the bubble I see in btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:55:46
It is to people outside of Reddit. Nobody trusts it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:24
Sure. But it's still way overvalued, there's so much uncertainty involved with it and it will take a very long time to integrate it into everyday life. Like I said I'm not saying the future of it is dead it's just way overvalued, as I not only see these problems but I also see nobody actively working to solve them. Seems like people just ignore them for the most part.

I'm kind of surprised more people who really believe in the whole bitcoin ideal are totally fine with the whales. Like isn't that basically the same as or worse than trusting the fed or a bank? I get that they're supposed to be fervent believers and what not but they still have significant control over price and could easily use it to their advantage. Aren't you in effect just transferring power from one group (elected by an elected official) to another (nobody really knows who they are). Is that better? Correct me if I'm wrong.

As a speculator I'm happy because of the volatility, it presents huge opportunities (for now). As someone who believes in the potential of bitcoin it really slows down progress. A futures contract mainstreams its relationship to fiat which doesn't help to reinforce bitcoin's true purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:46:27
And the problem with adoption is its volatility, which I do not see slowing down in the near future.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:28:58
This is even a few steps removed from a derivative or something though. There is zero underlying, and it still advertises itself as a cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:23:34
Right but more people must get involved. If it has serious problems then they won't..

Hey guys, I'd really like someone to make a lengthy, intelligent case FOR bitcoin. I lean on the bubble side but I'm not an asshole. I believe there's a serious case for both sides, I just don't know the pro bitcoin one as well I guess. I'm not a hater, just trying to see a poignant argument from the other side.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:29:41
Okay so at least someone is on the same page. Seems to me like there's a lot of cognitive dissonance here. Or ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:32:33
Isn't anyone else sort of concerned about bitcoin's lack of utility? Sure I believe in it's technology and what not but everyone here is so excited that their bitcoin is worth X amount in usd/eur etc. At the end of the day you can't do anything useful with your bitcoins other than turn it into fiat. 
The dot com bubble inflated due to a similar issue in my mind. Everyone believed in the internet as an idea and therefore invested. Similarly, many believe in the idea of bitcoin but it's lack of fundamentals are problematic.
Just like the dot com bubble didn't mean the end of the internet, a bitcoin bubble doesn't have to kill your crypto fantasies. I'm just sayin it's pretty ridiculous to call bitcoin a currency without being able to buy hardly anything with it.

Hey guys, I'm pretty new to bitcoin (and Reddit) and have a question I was hoping someone more experienced could answer. Let me first say that I do believe in the block chain and bitcoin's overall purpose; I think it's moving a bit too fast to sustain itself though. My belief is that while bitcoin does have a future the recent surge is most likely a bubble. It will take time to integrate bitcoin into everyday life for most people. Bitcoin can't keep up this kind of exponential growth without it reliably storing value or being accepted in most places as currency. Right now it seems (to most people) to be totally speculative. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:08:37
I think a huge roadblock to adoption is volatility. Nobody wants to take a form of payment which could lose 20% of its value in a matter of hours
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:10
If you have problems trusting government why do you trust coinbase? Or the "Whales" who own 40% of the coins and can yank the market at will, especially bc there's not really a regulatory policy. I really see your point about governments and I don't see anything wrong with btc itself just its current situation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:03:52
But it is critical to the transition from fiat to btc. Without stability in terms of fiat people won't take it seriously
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:07
Prices will stagnate for a brief period of time, people will panic, price will plummet. I'm pretty new to technical analysis and trading in general so I don't know enough to say definitively when but it's on its way
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:54:49
Right. Like from what I've seen none of the problems with bitcoin have to do with the ideal. The volatility and utility are sort of a product of the current fiat system, I see that. I just feel like it surged to high considering the problems with coinbase and what not. That's why I think it's a bubble. Not because it's garbage, it's just too early and will take too much time to integrate.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:49
Either way it has to stabilize in fiat terms before people adopt it. Even though gold has nothing to do with fiat it is much more stable than btc. One ounce of gold is one ounce of gold but the prices still fluctuate, but what if it regularly lost 15% of its value or more. Btc must win over fiat users and in order to do that it must be stable relative to everything else, you can't sell that idea to a business. I'm just saying btc has a long road ahead and it will not keep up exponential growth every month
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:33:57
I actually did watch it before. I didn't think that really answered a lot of my concerns though honestly
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:29:21
I'd love for you to explain that futures-like system you described in a little more detail. I'm really new to this stuff so bear with me
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:51:24
Gotcha thanks guys
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:42:27
Haha what dude why can't someone just make a case I wasn't trying to be a dick lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:45
The fact that BTC is this volatile is what makes it useless as a currency (it's intended purpose). This should be the scariest thing about this dip. No business could adopt this bc of those massive price swings. Maybe that is why people are selling, because it has no value other than converting it back to fiat. If any other popularly scrutinized gov currency had fees this high matched with so little utility it'd be trading lower than the yen
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:20:18
Comments like these time and time again get swept under the carpet. Even if the entire world were in full agreement over what bitcoin stands for it would take an enormous amount of time and energy to integrate it into daily life. I just don't believe these exponential gains can keep up. It'll stagnate, people will panic, and it could suffer a serious crash
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:01
I'm writing this to highlight some problems with bitcoin which a lot of people either overlook or simply do not know. This is strictly from a financial perspective. I do not wish to make any judgements on its technology.
1) General lack of responsibility from the exchanges. As much as btc believers love the fact that btc is separated from government, they should realize that when evaluating currency these exchanges should be judged (in a sense) as the entity behind it, as they have the most oversight and influence in transactions. This is significant and institutions will not forget it like many of us have here.
2) The lack of utility is shocking. This dip would be one thing if btc buyers were regularly using their coins for day to day sort of things, as they would see the value in it and not want to give it up. The problem is that btc's most valuable use is converting it back to fiat. Not a super attractive currency, but because it's a fad it's trading at 13000 usd per coin. That's absurd. The fact that almost everyone bought this with its value in fiat in mind knowing that it had no use other than that means that a dip could spell massive sell off ripples.
3) Volatility is a problem. No firm will adopt btc because of this. If a firm had received payment of 1 btc last week for a service they would've lost nearly 1/3 of its value by now. This seems to be a really obvious problem to its longevity yet most people say "it goes up, it goes down. Deal with it." Businesses will not deal with this, and they have very good reason not to. And then there's the people who love the volatility and see coins as financial instruments. What kind of asset is this exactly? It has no underlying, it just moves so much because of this fad. It's not gold either, gold has an established value and is supposed to protect from volatile markets.
All these problems aren't just any problems, they're essential to the definition of a currency. This leads me to think it is a bubble. Many bubbles are created when fads arise among the populous who can't properly assess the fundamentals. As much as you may distrust financial institutions they really do understand better than anyone how to value securities. This price drive has had zero institutional oversight or analysis. If any other currency displayed such high trans fees, poor oversight, lack of utility, or instability it would be trading at a lesser value than the yen. This doesn't have to mean that btc or crypto is over forever, just like the dot com bubble wasn't the end of the internet. Highlighting these problems just sheds light on the needs of the crypto market. Competition will step in and trans fees will lower and prices could stabilize. It's too early for btc to even be in the thousands in my eyes.
