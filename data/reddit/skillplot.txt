This. This is another glorious reason BTC will not be dead anytime soon and will only grow as time goes. Watched it from roughly 8 cents. Never knew of reddit for BTC until a week ago.. finally deciding to join and this was refreshing enough to have me do so.

That won't shine a negative light on BTC /s
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:04:37
That's funny, on your other comment I was thinking EXACTLY that. "Why spend 3300 on a license plate when the buy in was SO LOW 5 years ago for BITCOIN?"
Like I understand why people didn't buy in because they didn't believe in it's future success.. But you were obviously a hardened believer to buy a freakin' license plate at $3300 I'd imagine! What was going on here xD

Hmm.. When there's a chance for a coin splitting and leaving it open to all kinds of dysfunction if (trading) left open... I wonder why they're out of action. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:47:00
This is not a surprise. Everyone has been suggested not to transact BTC until after Aug 1. (or otherwise)
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:26:42
There's a LOT more options for "most" Americans. ATM's and Gas Stations that sell them are littered across the US. Not to mention the online services. There's more than I can think to mention.. Coinbase should be last resort imo.

Again, your actions are not my fault. The act of allowing it to happen is immoral but not necessarily illegal.

It was designed as a light version of BTC and "is the silver to BTC's gold."

So use another bank. If more banks make a habit out of it, they're only losing out on the gains during the time they have left to do so.
It would be best for them to hop on the bandwagon now and then learn to adapt to the crypto market so they can appease both fiat/crypto businesses until one takes over.

What in the... Troll go away.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:30:14
buddy all I knew was that it was some place 4chan people liked to talk to eachother. Seeing as though I'm a bit older than that crowd and considered myself more mature I never ventured into reddit.. Didn't realize it had areas of specific categories either, like this r/btc. What's your issue man?
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:30:36
You're telling me you have access to $200k just to blow on the chance game of BTC investing and you don't personally know any attorney friends that can send coinbase a letter letting them know you're willing to take necessary action to obtain your funds and costs of process to return those funds? This has worked for me in other situations.

FYI These models are base models. Whether it's 3 series, 4 series, 5 series idgaf if it's anything lower than 330/430/530. Now if we're talking 1 series nd 2 series nd 6 series? Or hell the 7 or god forbid 8? Those are different beasts and mean you've got some decent change in that pocket.

Owning a BMW with a BITCOIN number plate doesn't mean that you have millions of dollars in bitcoins. Just like **owning a BMW** doesn't make you a millionaire.*

Oh yes I did miss that. You would indeed be guilty of conspiracy.
Either way my entire point was about suicide before you detracted further. You can't relate "conspiracy to commit" with someone else's suicide unless it's assisted suicide, that remains true.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:41:46
This is just so great on so many levels
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:12:36
Someone mind picking this apart? I feel like this has something to do with "Bear trap" and "bull trap" and I thought I understood those but now I'm totally lost. Doubtful I'm the only one.. Just the only one who's loud about their ignorance in attempt to combat it.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:36:47
Last I checked it was 7-9% average (as low as 5%!). That's exorbitant? Try localbitcoins, that is just as easy if not more so!

State by state this does change. I was mistaken with a broad assumption based solely on what I know of my state. Where I am, felons cannot become a politician.

I'm typically good at interpretation once I've understood the parts used in it's mechanics and I believe I understand better now.. Still don't understand the banana tho
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:55:36
That is of course going to need to take place in the scenario I've given.
So basically I see the system being worth something different entirely when the fiat market collapses and only Crypto is left. Like they could potentially be worth 10x as much as the 1 satoshi = 1 usd because people realize they don't have a (physical) medium to value the bitcoin across anymore and bitcoin will be in demand that much more.
This is just me speculating more, but I think that at such a point the market will stabilize surely, but HOW LONG will that take? Especially with people utilizing multiple Cryptos at the point of fiat's eradication? I see a potential of BTC fluctuating with dips/rise in ways that would leave you broke one morning and rich by midnight, only to be back at broke when you wake up. There's just no telling really but that's where I worry and why I want to see where others think it will lead.

It was the topic of the conversation before you tried to make it into homicide specifically to prove your own point. Calm down and stop hovering my comments in other posts you stalking whack job.

@_date: 2017-06-09 04:17:00
IANAL but In the United States of America, you would be wrong. However, if this is a trial we are talking about then it could go either way. In reality, the person selling the rope with (or without) knowledge of their commitment to use that rope for a future suicide, is not directly responsible for the buyers future actions. If you think about it then by what you have suggested, the rope salesman would have been just as guilty to let the person wanting to commit suicide go home and do so, rope or not. How does that ensure justice? It does not. Our system isn't perfect but it does try to follow a sense of logic, for the most part. Anyways, I hope you understand a bit better now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:41:04
Neither. Would you charge the man selling the rope to the one who hung himself?
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:08:57
Not everyone does. I see every coin as a direction. If you had the option to attempt multiple directions in life instead of only one, would you try it? I would. 
Bitcoin's not the only horse in the stable..
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:35:26
Most people with some money typically know an attorney or two. Hanging out with them? Maybe not. Knowing them enough to get a letter sent, even for a novel fee? I'd think has a decent enough chance, no?

Specialized? Well. By definition, yes. However if everyone (and we were) expected them to be releasing something of a FPGA as GPU style card,  then not any one of us really want to admit it's "Specialized mining hardware." They are not lying about them being specifically designed for digital currency usage though.
