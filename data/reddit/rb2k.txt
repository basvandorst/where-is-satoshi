I was fed up with all the information overload on most sites and how ugly the mt gox graph is, so I amateurishly hacked together a site of my own.
p.s. I used day/month/year and a 24h clock for the times. Take that America ;)

The dates are correct, they are day/month/year , so there is no may data in there :)  
1. Valid point, I guess sooner or later I'll have to go down with the resolution anyway 
2. That's something that I like to avoid. My personal goal was to get a simple 1-line graph and not adding additional upper an lower bounds.  
3. It would be awesome if that worked, but isn't bitcoin pretty unpredictable at the moment? We're talking about 300% differences in within a week or two

The plan is to grab something from oswd.org and put everything it in there

These are definitely on the better side :)
Although I really don't care about calculated estimates in such a flaky market

So does github itself :)

Sometimes users also have setup an API client, those don't need 2fa either

there are firmwares that can do up to 8.2 Gh/s on a Jalapeno

I wouldn't want to keep anything important on something as flimsy as an SDHC card or a Raspberry Pi. I guess that paper wallet part is kinda nice, but neither of those components is particularly great when it comes to longevity :(
