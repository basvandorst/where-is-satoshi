I did update it elsewhere, they allowed me to withdraw it after I proved it was from bitcoin sales but closed the account.
it was approx 40k, i've since put more than 100k thru a nationwide account w/ zero issues so I'd recommend nationwide over any other bank tbh

Haven't used it for anything else. I'm skeptical too. I'll try and get more info
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:46:46
They finally got back to me, and asked me about the source of two deposits in May, I sent them proof of what it was so maybe I'll hear back.
They still hold that they will not be refunding the money, which is ridiculous. I spoke to a solicitor already and he said there's no way they can decide that unless a restraining order is won by the NCA or whoever, and since I haven't been notified that isn't the case.
Seems they're overstepping their boundaries a bit. he advised to give it just over a week before we send a legal letter demanding more information, but looks like I'll be getting it back (since I know the NCA has no interest in me)

I sold on LBC like many fidor users 
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:59:17
I've been buying/selling btc here for 5 years using LBC and exchanges overseas, never had a single thing questioned.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:52:01
Fuck knows then, hopefully some dickhead on LBC hasn't done a chargeback or something ��
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:15:06
I just got it for using for LBC since it's advised here
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:09:51
I can't buy a house for btc
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:07:56
Crap, they kept it?
I've just forwarded it to my solicitor, we'll take them to court. It's mid five figures so it's worth suing for.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:52:48
lol I only got it for LBC because this sub advises jt
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:17:28
Did you get your money back?
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:05:03
Yeah fuck em, never putting more than a few grand in a UK bank again, it's not worth the hassle if they can behave like this.
I still keep most of it in crypto, and it feels nice knowing no one can ever take it away haha.
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:03:25
nothing, a few years ago they said it was illegal here, but it wasn't. They said if you're exchanging currency you need to be licensed, but then btc wasn't classed as a currency.
But papers ran with the "Thailand makes btc illegal" story for months, it never happened and I know lots of btc users here.
Pretty sure they have no interest in it
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:29:05
You're an idiot
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:09:28
I only used it for like 2 days a few months ago, not a regular thing. I guess it prob looked suspicious now I think about it
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:27:18
will do, there's a substantial sum in there
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:39:46
I can't buy 99.9999999% of houses for btc
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:54:28
Looks like its gettin sorted out, I replied above
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:57:11
I can afford to sue them by myself but thanks
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:28:55
I'm not doing anything illegal lol.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:10:06
None, but if eh account is closed in 7 days I've checked and they legally have to
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:52:16
We sold to separate people so doubt they'd get us both

It's not a huge deal for me, I'll get it back. Just confirms why I keep offshore accounts �� Never had this issue outside the U.K. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:14:21
How long did it take to get your money back?
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:01:23
I still have about ten elsewhere. Just thought I'd give you a heads up.
But you prob have like a fiver in yours so not worth them looking at
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:28:56
May 28th to June 3, are they predicting the future or is it not full data yet
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:32:58
was forwards when i opened it, scrolled up to see what you meant, and it's backwards. so weird
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:10:59
I sold about 40k worth, in a week, a few months ago. Wasn't doing regular transactions.
