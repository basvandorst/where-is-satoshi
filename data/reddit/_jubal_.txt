One step further away, good encryption is built in to so many enterprise products now. It’s never been easier to fully automate certificate and secrets management

Handwriting the Bitcoin symbol is like painting the Apollo missions on a cave. If anyone had to read it in that format it means it doesn’t matter anymore.

I thought the only thing missing from the book was a discussion of the efficacy of value systems. Some certainly contribute far more to human well being than others. Western Civilization, while not harmless, has improved the lives of billions of humans  more than any other system. One of the reasons is that it is more grounded in reality than any other culture. 
Bitcoin has this advantage over fiat currency. There is a hard cost to create a bitcoin. Though it's value still relies exclusively on the fantasies of people, there is a grounding in reality. This is true of gold, real estate, and nearly every other asset class except fiat currency.
Can Bitcoin outcompete other fantasies? Yes. Will it? History/fate doesn't care a bit.
