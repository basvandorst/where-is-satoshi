To put it a simple way, let's say Bitcoin is at $1000 and you buy one full Bitcoin.
Now Bitcoin drops to $700, so you buy another.
Then Bitcoin drops to $500, and you buy another.
Now you have 3 Bitcoin for the price of $2,200.
So when Bitcoin goes back to $1000 per coin, you have $3000 worth.
Now, does that method work better than trying to time the market and buy around the bottom of a dip?  I have no idea on that, I guess it depends on how lucky you are.

Supply and demand works great for things we can see or at a minimum, things we can count.
With Bitcoin, we have no real way to know how many Bitcoin have been lost.  We have an idea, but no real way of knowing.  That has to mess with the idea of supply and demand.
The 100 Bitcoin (I don't have that many ��) I hold in a wallet that has not moved in 8 years. Is that part of the supply or is it lost? 
You know, because I just said so... But no one else knows.

How much of the market would we really need to grab before it makes the switch?

If you just fold paper in half... It still has the same amount of mass.  So there would be no loss in paper. It would simply change shape.
Are you saying Bitcoin is going to change shape?  
Now, if you cut half the paper away we would mathematically never get to zero..... But that is just in terms of math and numbers.
Another real world way to look at this is, if you stand at one end of a street and walk half way to the other end. Then keep doing that.  You will mathematically never get to zero.  However sometimes math is only good for numbers.  As once you got to half an inch from the end of the Street.  You would just count yourself as at the end.

I like to wonder about the problems I will never face... It makes me sleep well at night.

I try to take some off the market as often as I can.   
It drops, I buy a little.   It seems to be working out good so far.
