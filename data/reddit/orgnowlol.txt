Any opinion if they will send it? I mean, how important it is to them that I don't have my private key. I've been using them for a year now.

Nope, not a scam. He already sent \~$600 yesterday from one service (different btc wallet) and wanted to buy again today. He haid 600USDT laying in his binance wallet and I was stupid enough to not check and gave him my btc address and he sent the USDT. I'm fucked I really needed that money

Mate I didn't know this as he was hurrying me and he just sent it to my BTC address. FFS! How can I explain this to him now hes a mad italian that doesnt know english.

Who has 50 BTC LOL if I had that I wouldn't be begging for half a dollar to be paid here. There isn't an option on Localbitcoins to add how much fee you pay.

It is there, as you can see. I contacted also your support, please if you cannot give me my private key can you please do something about it? This money is very urgent, I needed it ASAP that is why I made this silly mistake.

Mate can you PM me and help me do this? Really need the money!

I have no other choice but them for withdrawing btc fo my bank account, as there are no other methods in my country. Damn this is so frustrating
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:03:55
I did already... problem is I know from experience they are really really slow...
Maybe sending like a dollar will somehow "unclog" the whole thing or just mess it up...

Yea lol.

I know man... I keep refreshing...13 confirmations now but nothing hit my wallet....
Guess I have to wait for them to reply to my ticket but this is so nerve-wrecking
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:59:25
But why... this never happened. Usually immediately when my sender sends the bitcoins it shows up in my incoming transactions.
Now its 100% confirmed and I didn't get a thing...

He bought a service of mine, and hes still waiting for it but I cant do shit until I get the money lol..idk why I keep thinking localbtc will scam me or something im just too paranoid this is important..like I said even if I directly click the link "show incoming transactions" from localbtc it takes me to their chain and it shows the transaction info,13 confirmations now. So yes its my address.

If you used LocalBTC you will know how it looks.
Usually when I get on the site, I hit "Wallet" and "Receive Bitcoins". Thats where my address is. When someone sends me bitcoins, under my address appears a small bar that shows the senders btc addy, amount sent, confirmations, time left etc. It did not show now.
Under "Receive Bitcoins" there is also a button "show your incoming btc transactions". I clicked on that and it took me to a site similar to blockchain (its localbitcoinschain.com) with all info there. 
Even there it shows the amount and sais it has 7 confirmations!! But no money in my wallet :(
