Is it supposed to be a joke? I feel like that's akin to putting a Trump quote like "I love the Mexicans" on racial sensitivity poster... close on the idea, but not at all what the person really stands for. Warrent Buffet falls into the Bitcoin detractor crowd, more than promoter.

I would have to say nocoiner should be above scamcoiner. Don't you think people are better off not having started at all, than to have been scammed out of money?

I hope someone finds a way to put that robo-zuckerfucker behind bars

I guess a new bull run means we get to see all the same memes again... Here we go!

I just tried and it actually looks like it has been taken down. Top link for me was:  (that's the link I copied from the site after I arrived, edit for clarification.)

Best I understand, and having glaced at the article, person 1 said Buffet meeting soon would further sour his perceptions of crypto. Person 2, I believe asked the article because the article focused on howJustin Sun said he wanted the lunch with Buffet to learn more about the way senior professionals in established industries think. It might have also mentioned Tron getting some positive press or usage traction in markets in China.

I will not post aloud, but will do whatever I please in silence.

Which will be the first to admit they are keeping Bitcoin reserves?

I would also like to see the distribution of ages of prominent leaders in the financial industry.

I prefer to look at history, performance over time, regulatory/tax trends, and expert analysis... Since I can't put deep soul knowledge into my analysis, I guess I'll have to stick with what I've got.

Thank you for mentioning the dollar-cost-averaging, something I wish more people knew about/applied.

Honestly, you can probably lump most in the top 100 too.
