Yes, but 1 Sat is not even a penny yet so that would be more confusing to new investors (ordinary people who are ready to throw $100 but not $6,000).

That would be more in line with how the dollar works i.e. $1 = 100 cents but the general public frankly wouldn't like the name Satoshi, or Centoshi for that matter. Bitcoin is, in my opinion, is at the end phase of early birds adoption, and for the majority of people to get into it, it needs to sound "legit" - no disrespect for Satoshi Nakamoto and its innovative community who worked on Bitcoin since its dawn tho. 
I'm one of those non-tech ordinary people who were fortunate to buy a couple of BTC last year. Nobody around me really knew it yet or they sort of had heard of it somewhere (probably because of Mt. Gox) but this year since summer, virtually everybody knows its existence yet they do not own a dollar worth of Bitcoin yet. 
If we want them to go in, we should make Bitcoin look like "real" money at an affordable price. The entry is still hard enough i.e. make a wallet, purchase Bitcoin with credit card or via Bitcoin ATM, register on exchanges to trade and convert it back to cash and etc. etc. but there are logistical barriers that tech companies will solve very soon. By making mBTC the official unit, we remove the psychological barrier that is probably bigger than a logistic problem.

I understand your input. But I disagree with respect. I think it's these little simple things that make an idea better understood. Most people are fundamentally lazy including myself, and this could make understanding Bitcoin slightly easier for everybody imo.

That's true, it's confusing enough that they are so many other units. But say, if the Core Developers and major crypto news sites like Coin Telegraph and Bitcoin News had a press release, it might work well. I'm sure they will be some people who misunderstand, but that's the case with anything new we experience in life.

Yah, I thought about that too, so my change.org petition mentions that very idea you just mentioned: both:)
Petition page is not yet visible until the first 5 signatures so maybe you can help make this actually happen!
