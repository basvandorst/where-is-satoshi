This was true for another nation wide US bank. Except I only had to cell for the very first buy. 
After that the payment processor, which is located in the UK, was no longer flagged.
I’m guessing this international processing, which has a fee, looks like fraud initially.

If you were to install any kind of new wallet on your phone/pc, one of the first options you’re asked is “new” or “existing” seed. If you were to go with existing and input that 24 word private seed, you would have access to all the crypto you see on your nano s. 
That seed is the avenue directing you to the cryptos location. The wallet is just the vehicle to interface with it.

I was thinking the same thing. I almost don’t believe anyone who claims they have convinced an employer to pay in this way. We are just not there yet.
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:50:55
Likely a panic over nothing. I sent a transaction last night with the fee set to high and it had an estimated 20min confirmation time. I think it took half that time to even show pending on the receiving end. I think you’re okay.

Yup! My first exposure to it was by friends who used it for buying MDMA off of Silkroad. The drugs sure were real and so my understanding of Bitcoins use was not that of a scam.

Maybe. You send address information via pgp encryption. So unless the vendor keeps records of sales on plain text documents, your shipping info should be obscured.

You don’t. Having Bitcoin on Coinbase isn’t truly under your control. Only Coinbase has those keys. Move your Bitcoin into your own wallet.

Search App Store for BRD wallet. Upon opening app you’ll select new wallet, it’ll generate a seed and you’ll than have Send/Receive options. Hit Receive, copy address displayed. Go to Coinbase, hit Send and input address given by BRD wallet.
Essentially all wallets work like this. I only have used BRD on a phone.

I buy bitcoin using what very well maybe the most popular exchange in the United States. Think of an exchange as a website/phone app where you can link a bank account/debit card to switch dollars into bitcoin. 
When I buy, the transaction displayed on my online bank account transactions reads something like this, “Debit Purchase - visa date Card ****coinbase **** cheapside”
Look for something like that on bank account activity. He could have been buying via exchange Coinbase.

@_date: 2019-06-01 04:34:15
As do I, but it always seems to be from leaving coin on an exchange and dealing with impossible withdrawal KYC. Or exchanges getting hacked or scamming. Last, from poor day trading decisions. I have never lost anything from my cold storage Trezor.
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:25:17
True that. I’ve always kinda wanted one of them 20 count tubes of them.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:49:48
It’s safe. Just write down and never lose the 12 or 24 word seed it generates for you upon creating a new wallet. 
I have stored some on BRD wallet before. Keep those 12 words and you can load your BTC funds on any wallet if you should happen to lose your phone or it becomes damaged.
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:13:32
I’m also confused by the number of high fee claims. I set to high every time when using Trezor or Electrum, see my pending transaction immediately and have 2 confirmations within 15 maybe 20 minutes. Cost ~$2.00.
I will agree, yes, these add up over time, but it’s satisfying piece of mind and feels worth it to me. Maybe I’m missing some kind of fundamental point? Like, if your output comes from many inputs you will see a transfer fee of many magnitudes larger? I think I’ll research now...
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:24:02
I briefly considered doing a gold buy with BTC via a site. My fear is whatever payment processing application used, could maybe, encounter issues with deposit addresses. 
Maybe having time limits, congested mempool and taking long or any kind of tech issue that these retailers would likely be far to uneducated to remedy. Could turn into a nightmare, especially after sending ~$1300 worth of BTC for an ounce of gold.
Anyone actually do a buy like this? Your experience?
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:27:58
Please elaborate on experience. Your given a deposit address. It confirms no problem and product it shipped. No hassle?

Trezor user here. No problems so far. Easy and intuitive interface for sending/receiving BTC. I’m behind on updating the firmware, but it still functions as a secure storage device. 
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:37:38
I vote for Trezor One. It has a simple, easy to use interface and has never failed me. I can’t speak from experience, but Ive read of some issues using Model T touch screen. Just seems slightly gimmicky and not necessary. Like anything, keep it simple. Too many moving parts introduce points of failure. Do what you want, but for sure use a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:25:15
Did you happen to go through the verification process for BTC withdrawing?

Simple. Your relative sold some.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:55:11
This scam works like this. Person asks for help. Says exchange won’t let them withdraw funds unless it’s a particular lump sum. Example, they have 1.36 BTC, but it must be 1.4 BTC to withdraw. Scammer convinces you to help by depositing that little .04 BTC to reach that particular lump sum... you just got scammed.
It’s really not that scary. Just buy on an obvious trusted exchange that’s been around awhile and don’t bother mixing your financial affairs with any outside people. Easy.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:32:48
Yes, I recently experience the same issue. It does this to me each time I hit the max button before withdrawing. I find that if I manually enter the figure minus a few cents, the issue goes away.
Maybe it’s a bug as someone else pointed out. I’ve also always gone to withdraw right after purchase, so I’ve never tried waiting a short time than moved to cold storage.
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:57:53
No, but then again I don’t hang about for hours watching any of them. Your question is valid and asked often. I would imagine they are profitable/being used, otherwise a prospecting BTC ATM would be owner wouldn’t pay to install one.

Sure you could track and see where on the blockchain your stolen BTC are at. The issue is you cannot do anything about it. You can’t take back control of the private seed to move them yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:40:30
Right now $100 gets you around ~0.0089 bitcoin. No matter how much the value in dollars changes, you’ll still have 0.0089 BTC. At any point if you sell, you will get the dollar amount of 0.89% of a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:11:01
A wallet is a vehicle for dictating where on the blockchain your bitcoin is located. By changing its location, you determine who has ownership (private keys). 
You now need a wallet. Maybe try BRD if using iPhone or Electrum if desktop. Upon setup and selecting new wallet, a 12 or 24 word “seed” password is displayed. Write down and never lose. 
In wallet click receive, you’ll see a long string of characters. Copy. Open cash app, click withdraw, paste that string of characters. Send. Your BTC is now transferring to a location you have 100% control of. 
No matter what now, you control location of that coin. Even if you lose your phone or pc crashes. Just download wallet, select new wallet, pick already have seed and input 12-24 words. Your BTC appear back under your control.

I also bank with US Bank. I had to call the customer support number, inform them that the Coinbase charge was mine and legitimate (not a fraudulent charge). The service rep wasn’t at all concerned and un-flagged Coinbase. I’ve been able to buy ever since.
You’ll notice on your online bank statement that each Coinbase buy also has an additional “international processing fee”. I’m guessing that is the reason Coinbase is initially flagged. It appears to be a purchase outside of the U.S.

Another vote for Trezor. Simple set up and intuitive user interface.
