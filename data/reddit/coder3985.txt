Yeah, well I invested at around $130 so not far to go now.  Obviously I've just jinxed it though.

Yeah, we've already broken through Rhodium parity.  I was surprised that didn't get much of a mention though.

Digital currency is better than "virtual currency" at least.

I think if Satoshi sold 900,000 Bitcoins we'd crash to near zero - firstly because of the order books on all the exchanges, and secondly a huge exodus from the network because of a lack of faith.  So don't do it, man (or woman!)

f = (10 * 0.8 - 0.2) / 10

Divide both sides by P, so N=1.

What I don't understand is why the block size capability won't increase anyway due to Moore's Law?
Faster computers, faster internet pipes should mean that a block size &gt; 1MB won't always be in the hands of "centralised powerful miners".  Maybe an individual miner would be able to handle 2MB next year?

They did find a problem though - "This hoarding problem is a big problem".  Is that really a problem?

I assume she'll stop saying "The Bitcoin" at some point.
