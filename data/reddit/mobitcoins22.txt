Wtf? If you put your paycheck in the bank you are still poor. The dollar is collapsing and they will pay you zero interest.

I have no idea. I think dealing in person with cash or bitcoins is risky.
If I were to buy locally, I would start with a tiny amount like $10, and do many small transactions. Experience will help protect you from getting scammed.

I have gotten great help in minutes about bitstamp and electrum. Are you sure such question are not appropriate?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:59:34
This is very good news.
You can have sex with Bitcoins.

Do research on keepass. There may be some backup or other functionality that you didn't know about. Maybe it writes a temp file and deletes it.
Write down everything you know about the password. Even if it is not possible to crack it now, it may be possible to crack it in 10 years for $1,000,000. If bitcoin takes off it could be worth much more.

You can wait for an ETF. You may need to rollover your 401k into an IRA.
Or you can do a self directed IRA and hold bitcoin directly. This is better, faster and cheaper.

Bitcoin is becoming a safer investment each day. When it was $10, there was a lot of doubt.
Now it's a different environment. The government has not banned it, Silicon Valley is investing, china is buying, many people can put bitcoins into their IRA.
The chance of bitcoin succeeding is higher than ever. And if it does, then it should be $10,000 to $1,000,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:24:49
I think coinbase is your best bet.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:55:43
Haha, I checked here too.
It's a funny story. I went to Starbucks a week ago and the people next to me were talking about bitcoin. So I said, I'm into bitcoin too. It turns out that he works for bitcoinstore.

I don't know of one, but it is a much needed service!

How much is 1 share?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:07:41
He is scared because they just want you to be stupid so they can continue to steal your money.
Bitcoin ETF's are coming out and you can buy them in your 401k or transfer to an IRA and buy them there.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:40:07
I think it's good for your company. You can position it to be the next Paypal. It's like "PayPal for Bitcoin".
If you want to grow by 10x in 6 months, this could be the way to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:35:11
Yes, bitcoin is opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:34:38
100k by next year is not likely, but 10x is possible sometime next year. That makes about 10k.
The following year could go up by 10x again, making 100k.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:41:56
Which retailers? Which products?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:13:30
No don't put it in a painting! Someone will steal them. Just make a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:17:07
I would describe US monetary policy as irresponsible. 
Like a teenager with a credit card.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:09:44
You can pay with bitcoin on eBay???
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:43:49
I don't see why anyone would pay with bitcoin. You have no protection.
I guess it's good to get paid by bitcoin unless it is against eBay TOS.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:26:12
Is send me 1 btc
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:24:26
Korea is going to be  after china and India. Adoption in Korea would help fuel bitcoin.

1hCSijk64278fryij56789FRYjhf5784FRj sounds much better.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:57:49
Another nail in the coffin for the dollar.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:38:24
Perfect. As soon as we get to $10k I'll drop by and pick one up. No need to stop at the bank first!
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:54:32
Don't use gox. It sucks. It has sucked for over 1 year.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:08:25
How much would you sell it for?
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:22:22
Sounds great. Just don't feel bad if bitcoin crashes or disappears.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:27:22
You don't understand how password attacks work.

Yes I saw tat too and wonder if it is a scam..

I think these are reasons that make it easy to become a millionaire.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:44:54
If crypto currencies take over you shouldn't need a mortgage.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:07:40
They are screwed. They own $1.1 trillion in bad U.S. debt. They can't sell because the dollar would collapse and they don't want to buy more. The only solution I can see is to buy bitcoin.
If that happens, bitcoin will go up 1,000x to 10,000x.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:17:54
Coinbase and bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:07:36
Fwiw, you have the best job. You get paid to do research on how to get rich.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:17:06
It's good if Amazon accepts bitcoin.
Retailers can give people the option to pay directly with bitcoin. And offer a discount for doing so.
Amazon give bitcoin a huge boost for free.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:06:22
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:52:35
Yes, because they didn't get some of your money.
