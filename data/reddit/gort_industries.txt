Consider including 3Blue1Brown's video on crypto currency. It lays a good foundation for what what a big leger is.

A lot has changed since 1986. It's blacked out, but holes are replaced by QR codes. I have no idea what my grandparents would think.

Good question. I just clicked it and didn't have any warnings, but who knows. Brb... gotta reformat...

Have you found [the page]( that makes animated bubbles on your screen for different transactions? It modifies the pitch depending on the size of transaction (lower pitch = bigger transaction).
e: word is page use to have malware.
e2: link removed because two people have mentioned malware. replaced with bitlisten.

Q3) Who would accept that kind of risk?
I'm not sure that if you wanted to sell that much BTC that it would all have to go to one person; It's not like trying to sell a mansion that only goes to one person. It would probably be in your best interest to sell in smaller chunks to not flood the market with a bunch of value to sell, but I'm not sure how small these chunks would have to be.

If you're not a citizen of the states, I would think it's the companies responsibility to figure that out. Not sure though... just a thought.
I do know the IRS released a notice about digital currency recently, but I'm not sure it would apply to you since you're not in the states. See [this PDF](

I think an important distinction should be made. Creating a paper wallet does *not* give you the private keys to the addresses that are associated with your coinbase account. This is very different from other online wallets (like blockchain.info) that give you the PK's to the addresses that are managed.
Then again, you offer very different services.

Does anyone have any experience with meeting your seller / buyer in a law enforcement parking lot? They are generally surveillance and some local departments even encourage their use.
Here's an [article in WaPo]( about the practice.

Looks like they added a little note at the bottom.

I'm not sure why this was surprising though. There is more value in gold on the planet then there is (currently) with BTC. Try pushing a full shopping cart down the road, then with the same amount of energy, push a car. They both move, but the car less so.

If they didn't, wouldn't the difficulty adjust bringing the blocks every ~10 minutes?
