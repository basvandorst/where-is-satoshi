I remember using BitMarket.eu, where they held the BTC in escrow and you had to do an IBAN wire transfer to the person selling the bitcoin to their personal account. Larger transactions were sometimes split up over multiple sellers. Once the seller confirmed the receiving of the money, the BTC were released from escrow

having fun and enjoying life does not pay the bills. Sure it's nice to have but it does not change a liability into an asset. Seriously, how many assets do you really own in your life, honestly? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:38:42
it has nothing to do with risk, an asset puts money in your pocket, a liability takes money from your pocket

as a general rule, one should diversify. Some investments, some in cash, some in precious metals, and heck, why not some in BTC. Some will tank, some will flourish. If you want to score big, bet everything on one poney.

I own bitcoins as an insurance just like I own farmland, gold and guns. It's not because the price of some of the guns has gone up that I will sell them. Nor the farmland. Ever... it does not make sense to sell ones insurance... you can rebalance your stake by selling off some bits but that means you might get caught with your pants down if the price drops...

exactly, the same thing happens to people who collect a large sum of money (up to 3 years before they die) and they give the money way to a nurse who takes care of them... usually to avoid inheritance tax or to screw over their own children, if you can't prove what the money was spent on (home improvement, a new car, ...) then the government will ask the official receivers of the inheritance to pay tax on that cash money. And yes, that can be a nasty surprise

You can't exchange 3.7 million and not attract attention, even if you split it in 10k chunks. In a way he is better off losing 45% and having it all clean now, so at least he can spend it. How are you going to explain this new found wealth if you can't explain where it came from? How are you going to buy a car or house without having to explain to the tax people where the money came from? Much use in having 3.7 Million and only can spend it on small things you can pay in cash only... Think about it!

The fixed costs (power cords, racks, cooling fans &amp; ducts, ) are always there, even if you get the mining equipment for free you still have to monitor it. I have plenty of equipment here and either it's so old I don't run it or if it's newer but something broke like a power supply, controler board or CPU cooler, repairing it is not worth it. For example I have first generation ASICS here, at 650 Watts / unit they produce 72 GH/s. At current difficulty (and that keeps increasing), it would generate per unit 0.0004977 BTC/week or about USD 0.3491/week per unit. In a year it will be less than half that. I have about 30 units here, that would mean USD 10 / week. Other than the benefit of free heating (about 20kWh!) the hassle (noise, fire hazard) is not worth the USD 10 / week. Besides that, a large investment (work wize) would only be interesting if you can keep it running for 5 or 10 years and non of the mining equipment lasts longer than a year. Hard to make a case...

First of all, if you have bitcoin and you want to talk about a number, quote it in BTC, not USD. Stop thinking in USD. Volatility makes it useless...
BTC 127 is not a lot of money, in the larger scheme of things...
Have a look at the biggest exchanges and see how much daily volume they turn over:
For example in USD, let's pick
they have an average of BTC 4132 daily transactions.
BTC 127  extra is not going to move the market...
You can split it up into multiple transactions to average out the selling price. You can split it over multiple exchanges.
More important it's to check how you are going to get the USD out of the exchange, if you exceed certain USD levels, you will have to comply to certain KYC laws, thus registering your identity. This might be a lengthy process...

Your $349100/week only makes sense if you can suck up the entire 650MW 24/7, that is not 'excess power' to burn in low demand hours. If you have 6 out of 24h where you have excess power it will not be 100% excess power because then your power plant is wrongly dimensioned in the first place. So your $349100 is only going to end up to be a fraction, perhaps 10% of it. In theory... 
And where/how are you going to host 1 million devices each consuming 650W? A big chicken coop like farm like some of the Chinese mining setups? Do you have any idea how much hassle it would be to manage such a setup? Start with building a network with enough ethernet ports for 1 million devices. Then add 1 million power plugs. Again, such a setup will only be profitable if you can run it 24/7 for multiple years.

Vladimir club: 1/10.000 of the possibly available btc. With only 2100 btc back in 2012 when it was discussed you are good. Taking in account today's pricing scale it down to 21 or 2.1 btc. Or 210 btc if you buy the dip. If 2.1 btc sounds small today, check back in 5 years...

Yes because the IRS looks at 'lifestyle indicators' to spot potential targets. If you live a lavisch life but don't have an income to support it, you can expect a visit, at least here in Europe. Most big ticket items (a house, a car, guns, foreign travel) are registered and analysed. It goes to the point where our IRS is buying data from companies like Facebook to see who is posting (private) pictures of their foreign travels and exotic holiday destinations, and that is legal even... What use is it to have a lot of money if you can't spend it. Are you going to spend 10k/month on food?

He is using a service like bitpay to get garanteed USD into his companies bank account for each transaction, he actually never touches any BTC

those bitcoins will be worth the same once the network comes back. There are various physical carriers for BTC (paper wallets, usb tokens) where the secret key is hidden (like casascius coins) where you can keep bartering. 
In contrast, in which of the current crisis countries like Zimbabwe or Venezuela did you see people start trading using gold or silver? Show me one recent example, the only think I can come up with was refugues in WW2 that carried gold and diamonds. And guess what, diamonds fell out of grace a long time ago.... How do you verify the value of a random piece of gold on your foodstand?
I´m long bullets and BTC, one of them is bound to have value :-)

two points: good luck in going down to a pawnshop and get fair value for your PM once they can´t use a computer or phone to check the current value, you will get 50 cents on the dollar once every network goes down. What happened in the 2008 crisis? Gold value went downi instead of up, because people needed to get out of (paper) PM to pay their bills.
As for places like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, it´s fairly narrow minded to think these people are to poor to hold anything worth USD 16 or USD 1275. Do you really think these people can´t afford cars and houses? Try traveling the area before drawing your stereotypes....

Dave Kleiman did not have any reasonable amount of money to spend and somebody did (mis)use his own company resources to start mining bitcoin in 2009. And that person has problems explaining those expenses to the tax people so he's in trouble. See how it all fits together?

The problem is not selling firecrackers, the problem is endangering postal workers by shipping them through the regular mail system without any precautions, correct packaging or labeling. There are reasons why you can't put items with Lithium batteries in express packages shipped through air transport, still you can ship them using ground or cargo transport.
