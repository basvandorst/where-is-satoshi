lol "only segwit" , this is why BTC is going to struggle in the next few years. For many, crypto is hard enough to understand. With Segwit and Lightning, its a long ways off until the average consumer feels like they can trust themselves let alone the system.

It’s been mentioned thousands of times.

Too complex for most. Thats why some alt coins are going to come out over BTC at the end of the next bull run, in my opinion.

Blows my mind. Would you rather have 7k cash doing nothing in the bank or 6.5k btc waiting to explode again 
@_date: 2018-05-10 06:28:51
fucking hate that mentality. yes, you can blame victims. A wiseman once told me "if you have a problem, you are part of it". In most cases in the western world, I find that statement true more often than not.

I don’t think most people read the links here. Most of it is utter bullshit. People love their buzzwords. Nothin like “institutional money” to start the day off on a positive note. 
I’ll say I moved my btc to other coins because I like a central team and not an open source project. There is too much tech shit going on before btc becomes viable. Forks, installing segwit, different wallets for lightening...all seems too complicated when other coins have better utility and experience than bitcoin.

The 3\-4K holdouts are some of the most annoying in the btc community. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:02:01
I agree with you. As the whole crypto environment evolves, people will see the btc has as many flaws as advantages over other coins. 
Does anyone think "institutional money" wants to invest in something with a history of forking, slow tx times, and no centralized team to decide its direction? It might not die but its not going to be number one forever. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:34:01
Maximalists holding 5 btc they got last summer lol 
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:50:02
You have to remember, people like being herded. If people are worried about losing money and economic meltdown, why the hell would they invest in something as volatile as bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:14:50
Just another reason why smart contracts need to be essential for a "decentralized economy". 
BTC is behind the pack in this category. Its not going to be dominate forever :) 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:25:10
shows how bad the btc decentralized community is at getting it noticed. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:19:36
this is why Bitcoin is going to fall behind other coins. It is total shit for use as a currency right now. Pisses me off seeing people in this community screaming adoption when its simply not ready yet.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:18:05
can it really be adopted as a currency when people are predicting and hoping for 100k \+ ? I feel like currency vs store of value is going to cause the next big btc fork somehow
@_date: 2018-06-02 22:32:25
You mean like good teams, actual use cases, parternships with industry leaders, and way better tech? Yeah, I guess those are good reasons not to invest. 
Hows lightning network coming along lol

I don't like to be the "how long have you been in btc" guy, but anytime I see price doubts I just assume they have only been around since $1,000 + btc 
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:16:48
stop with this bullshit. The overwhelming majority of BTC users have bought it as an investment asset, hoping it moons. It might be meant for digital transactions but currently is absolute shit at that compared to other coins.
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:20:34
asking how to transfer btc is ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:46:39
Bitcoin will only be a novelty currency until the price isn't volatile (I'm thinking 1\-2 years of true stability) 
Don't make this community for something its not. Most people here are investing for the gains first, the idea of a decentralized currency second, and the underylying tech third (because btc tech sucks compared to other coins)
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:34:22
I contest that or am missing the point. Two apps working on a decentralized network  together = partnership. How is that a bad thing? 
 If BTC isn't enabling and fostering decentralized partnerships, how is it going to grow?  What is to stop another fork in Bitcoin community or war from the mining community? The tech is too far behind other coins for practical use as a currency and it doesn't have much use as a utility otherwise. Right now I see lightning network, which makes buying a crowdfunded solar powered nutcracker easier and in a "decentralized" way (you'd be buying it on the old shitty version of the internet), otherwise no tech milestones to look forward to.  
Full disclaimer, I don't believe that democracy works and that is why I don't fully invest in the "decentralized" aspect of bitcoin. I invest in crypto teams that have attributes of Plato's Philosopher Kings. People who are setting out to change society for good but also don't let the crowd stand in their way. Obviously I'll have to wait 5 years or so for these projects to mature to know if it was a good decision. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:39:16
Its an extremely *dumb* question is all. All of your fear of being dumb and losing your btc aside, the question you asked is literally:  "how do I transfer btc from one one address to another" OR "how do I convert btc to fiat" 
My problem with these types of threads is that this r/bitcoin shouldn't be used as a help forum. If mass adoption ever happens, these threads will completely over saturate this forum. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:21:06
Don't sell! Put your investment in emerging coins.
There are coins that aren't lagging behind btc in terms of usablity as a currency. Instead of a clever smartass remark of how I'm an idiot, I challenge you to retort with how btc is going to stay viable when other coins *already* have faster tx, smart contracts, and partnerships with existing merchant industry leaders. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:57:55
So, what are you doing to push adoption? Any ideas on how to make the process of going from fiat \- \&gt; btc \- \&gt; retail use easier? Otherwise adoption won't ever happen.
The average person is going to stop listening before you even tell them about lightning network. 
lets be real, a huge percentage of btc hodlers are in it for the gains. If they have to convert back to fiat, so be it. If BTC actually becomes the currency that other fiats are pegged to, then they'll stick. The btc community seems divided on investing for the gains or replacing fiat with btc. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 05:56:59
one of the key principles of running a business is not being a dumbass, like breaking the law and selling at a loss just to show you have "balls". Keep your .2 btc to yourself 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:18:56
Yeah, despite how it’s created and circulated , traditional currency will buy me damn near anything. I can buy a stupid T-shirt with BTC or a luxury apartment from a nerd. It’s a novelty.

@_date: 2018-07-27 16:32:23
good luck with that whole adoption and use case thing when someone has to jump through 25 hoops just to acquire bitcoin. 
"Ok now after you've waited a week for exchange confirmation, days on the initial deposit, hours before you're crypto arrives, make sure you download the right wallet, it has to compatible with LN network"
its all too cumbersome for the average person and without the average person , BTC will be overlooked as a currency

Lol...you realize our mainstream media has a lot of foreign nationals calling the shots? Our media influences people all the time. Our government influences foreign elections even more (check out the Wikileaks cable of US interference in French elections, it’s a little more “involved” than releasing classified documents.
I don’t support either trump or Clinton (I don’t even believe in democracy), but Americans saw Clinton for the corporate corrupt whore she was regardless of Wikileaks. If she lost thousands of classified emails that she sent illegally, would you have wanted her at the head of an economy that is at the dawn of conversion to crypto?
If anything the media has done a great job of painting Russia as we saw them in the 80s, yet I’ve NEVER met a person that can give 5 reasons that make Russia so evil (those 5 reasons can’t include something the US actively does as well). Russia, the big bad boogie man, lol enjoy the koolaid. The only enemy is the 1% and all former and future presidents will serve them and only them

I know its 2018 and people can't determine criticism from bullying BUT the "negative" people are simply pointing out the reasons why a BTC is in my opinion a gimmick. 
If you want to pay using crypto, pay using the crypto. Creating a network of crypto ATMs is taking away from creating an actual infrastructure where crypto is used for commerce and not fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:14:23
In most cases its stupid, why are you so offended by that? 
If you are moving around money and get to a point where you NEED cash and have no means of getting it without fees, yeah, you probably aren't the best at planning your finances out.
