I'd be more inclined to say he's a believer if he put say 1 billion into BTC. Even then he'd still be less invested than me, relatively speaking of course. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 09:06:34
Pretty amazing that your gov takes money from savings accounts like this.  Seems to me that not touching savings for two years should be nothing out of the ordinary.

@_date: 2019-03-05 19:20:57
I mean in the sense it's a totally insignificant amount to him, it's not like he's putting it all, or really anything on the line because he believes in BTC so much.

@_date: 2018-06-29 12:59:32
It's called astroturfing.
The followers of every other shitcoin need BTC die.
Also, lots of people have panic sold, and they now need the price to drop further to avoid buying back in at a loss.  It's their attempt at spreading FUD.
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:39:36
I agree its  never obvious when exactly the right time is, but if you sell when its starting to level out after going parabolic on the annual chart, then buy when its starting to level out at a reasonable level after the correction, you wont go far wrong.

Remember those idiots on r/btc arguing about how its vapourware, and that no one will ever use it.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:06:22
If he buys now and it goes to 1k then back to 10k he bought low.  Trust me, at some point in the next couple of years 4k will be seen as low.
Following your logic he shouldn't buy at 1k as it could go to 300. Meaning he would not have bought low in your eyes. I agree it's relative.  4k is low relative to where he sold and relative to where btc will be by the halving if/when it follows the exact same pattern it has several times already. Which up to this day it's doing perfectly.
Yeah he could potentially lose some additional profit by not waiting for a further drop, but he could also lose if 3500 was the bottom,  if he doesn't buy in now and the price keeps climbing.
For me it's enough profit already to just get in now and not having to follow price 24/7 and worry about trying to time the market perfectly.
Full disclosure: I'm in now, but I'm a medium /long term player.
@_date: 2019-02-19 13:36:09
A more accurate estimate.
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:37:02
Obvious shill is obvious.
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:47:17
...because nobody sold the top,  it's just not possible right. 
I love the way doomsayers are always going on about how everyone got fucked buying the top. Yet can't understand that for every buyer there's a seller.
You might not have noticed but all the other anti btc trolls/astroturfers have given up already.  Like they always do as the bear comes to an end.
Sounds to me like you're the desperate one.
@_date: 2019-02-23 12:29:06
Ahh ok.  You replied to me though not him. :)

I don't think it would be impossible for say one 55th of BTC's miners to decide to switch to a well-publicised pool that was set up with the intention of 51%ing bcash.

I don't see the "regular company" implication (at what point does a company become irregular?). 
Apple is a single company.
Of course, the comparison may or may not be completely spurious, but Apple is a single company, that's all there is to say about it.

That's like saying "You don't KNOW for sure my 72 off won't beat your pocket aces".
Technically the statement is true, but no one who really understands the game would rather hold the 72 off.
