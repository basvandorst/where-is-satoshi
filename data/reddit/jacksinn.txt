I look forward to Changetip working with Facebook so I can at first tip my more tech savvy friends and get them started with Bitcoin (and other users seeing the tip and wondering what it is) and then maybe it can grow from there.

Just bought some more on Coinbase on Tuesday and the value has slipped a decent percentage by the time it was delivered today :( It's our anniversary weekend so I was loading up on some coin to head to the West Village to check out the place that has the Bitcoin ATM and grab my wife one of the skull necklaces. 
I wonder what the prices at the ATM are like - it may just be worth my while to metro to Manhattan and buy coin there rather than through Coinbase due to the volatility esp. if I plan to spend it relatively soon.

I had no idea this was happening. We'll definitely go next Sunday. I've only spent bitcoin on reddit gold and donations so this will be great.

Fantastic! I'll have to bring the family by. Cheers from Brooklyn!

I got excited when we had a Bitcoin fair in NYC and when Overstock started accepting it so I finally started spending it. I spent 6 BTC in one transaction in 2014 on some damned household goods. I kick myself but at the same time I tell myself I was helping the bitcoin economy.

I kept kicking myself in the ass seeing it go from 30 to 130 to 440 to 600 then 800+ before it dipped down a bit. I got tired of kicking myself in the ass and bought at 600 or so and am so glad I did. Sure, I'm not getting the huge gains I could've gotten  if I held onto some I would have bought a year or more ago but I may have spent the coin and besides you gotta buy in some time.

If you have access to a linux box (you can run a live distro too) run dd and foremost - I used those to recover pics from a camera and there was an article in 2600 magazine about it. Here's an article  and the best of luck to you!
