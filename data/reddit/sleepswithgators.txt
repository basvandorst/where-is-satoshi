And if we didn't save the back up word list?
@_date: 2016-04-07 18:58:41
Thanks everyone for the input.  
Problem fixed.  Got my $850 out onto a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:02:44
So it's not time to download OB yet?
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:22:26
Not asking the interweb how to buy bitcoin the safest way without being tracked by your bank or government. 
The second you asked all kinds of red flags and pings hit you up and now you're on a national/global list of usual suspects that dabble in possible terroristic activity via the use of crytography technology.

I rocked Brave for a few weeks, deposited BTC the whole 9 yards.
Needless to say, I deleted and uninstalled that garbage.
It crashes all the time, has all kinds of bugs etc.
Feels like I wasted $5 BTC, shit by now, it's worth 6 or 7
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:15:43
OpenBazaar all the way.  If you're looking to trade exactly for BTC, maybe Purse.io, bitify?

Between price fluxuations and gambling,
Just walked out of FortuneJack broke as funk, had a good run though.
Started out $5, was going full throttle  on the black jack table, debated forever on pulling out, but hey, that's why I have 3 boys, after a few dabs I was holdn to that last thread of hope that my last max bets would be the stepping stone back to the hyundoh's and I would definetly pull out this time.

Samurai is nice &amp; new, Mycelium is the best, if you're stuck with an Apple product your forced to use BreadWallet :(
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:24:46
The anxiet is killing me.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:45:58
I had a little chat with a bitcoiner (BTCwoman) from Venezuala.  
She says that they're arresting anyone found involved in the bitcoin ecosystem in her country and arresting them with bogus charges.
History repeats itself.
You fight banksters, you die.
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:23:27
I think Paxful introduced some widget/API that does that.
You can also check out bitsquare.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:49:34
It's not a bubble, it's an ever growing fungus.
We are at $1K steady.
You are going to read more and more about $10K and say to yourself, yeah right one day if lucky, i'm not that lucky.
Then next year you are going to be reading this very thread saying to yourself, funk, funk, funk!.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:30:36
I'm sure they are in plans for a huge over haul back, front, and GUI end.
Samurai is out.
@_date: 2017-02-02 06:55:09
Yes, most payment processor API's are backed by companies who have strict regulations, having been known to freeze people's fiat and crypto accounts.
If you notice on most website you pay with BTC, don't use send from a wallet hidding behind Tor or Orbot, Coinbase nor Bitpay will accept  the payment, one has to manually disable routing their wallet through Tor and then suddenly the payment processing company will accept the coin.  Tried this a gazillion times with many, Purse.io, Gyft, eGifter, etc.
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:18:30
So long as you route Mycelium traffic through Orbot, both downloaded via Fdroid, on a phone with no phone service just wifi capabilities?  
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:39:49
LibertyX, you will never use LBC again after you go with LibertyX.  
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:15:54
Something like that.  Keep your eyes pealed.
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:30:11
So is there a payment API where we don't care abou where the coin came from we'll mix them later can be practiced?
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:30:26

I don't know my buddy has managed to pull out several hundred BTC gambling.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 07:01:15
I've seen it work instant for new customers. Is it a pre-paid Debit card?    
@_date: 2016-01-28 07:11:20
Where do I download the client?
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:11:46
I have purchased some BTC stickers of a vendor from Venezuela on OB.  
Figured it would help the BTC economy in Venezuala.
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:39:56
Why don't we have this in the USA?
@_date: 2017-01-27 11:56:00
I guess it was a delayed verification thing.  Honestly though I killed the entire account.  After reading a few pages on reddit and elsewhere, i wouldn't touch coinbase with Trumps finger.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:24:07
@_date: 2017-01-29 08:52:39
bitsquare.io is ok but the methods of payment are not broad enough.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:25:01
Someone should re do this with a bunch of other carts linked behind, each one holding a different crypto, maybe in order of value.
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:37:44
That's awesome.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:09:06
If you're in the USA, LBC if you don't have a BTM around.
Mycelium Trader if you're in a major metro area.
Everything else will make you wait a minute while it verifies you're a real person
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:34:53
Would this be like implementing shapeshift.io?
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:34:22
Same here except it later said that it was approved without having to fix the issue.
The more I read on reddit/coinbase the more I want to just shut my account down.  I have 3?FA, text, computer IP, and, Google Auth set up but feel like it's not enough.
@_date: 2016-11-03 12:21:55
There's so many BTM's in my area, most stores that carry them have an incentive in making sales also so they offer 10% discount with the receipt saying you used the machine.  There are even escort services that take them for membership fees and more from what I understand.  And even a stripper bar that accepts for everything but the girl.
@_date: 2016-11-01 18:48:02
Awesome, keep the good fight going
@_date: 2017-01-23 05:28:48
This is interesting.  
Some website's that use Coinbase as a payment processor suffer the problem when you send coin using Obot for example, the payment will not be accepted.
Immediatly switching Orbot off and sending coin again suddenly it accepts the payment.
I'm going to have to experiment using Samurai Wallet and see if the problem persist.
@_date: 2016-12-18 19:36:59
Yes, that is the case.  You're going to want to get $100, save the rest and have fun watching it go up and down in value, you never know, you might wake up in the morning and have almost made all your money back with the change alone.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:34:41
This is a great idea, and also to post it on OpenBazaar as it is the new way to properly execute these deals.  Wish I was making that kind of coin at the moment so I can move in lol.
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:59:46
Glad someone brought this back up.  I have been wanting to start something like this in my area.  Maybe now that Shapeshift exist, the possibilities are endless.
@_date: 2016-12-11 13:30:59
Never used it, what are the fee's?
@_date: 2016-02-27 12:20:46
South Street lost that underground Vibe when club "Space" shut down. It was in Philly that I discovered how to get gasoline with bitcoin, buy via "Gyft"/"eGifter" a "Gamestop" card, trade for "Shell"/"BP" gift card.  You can't buy beer with those gift cards though. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 02:32:57
Seems like a major black out with their verifone systems, Can't find any LibertyX locations that are active in a 3 state radius.  GA, TN, NC.  
@_date: 2016-02-26 07:48:28
Can you only sell after being verified?
And do I need to specifically use Airbitz as a BTC wallet to pay from Android?
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:11:30
The Data breach prob had something to do with eliminating the points.  Better go spend them now, I have amassed quite a few in hopes to test out if I can buy a gyft card with bitcoin at 99% off :)
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:55:22
Circle &amp; LibertyX are the cheapest way to buy bitcoins on the go.  
My favorite exchange at the moment is BleuTrade.  
@_date: 2016-09-27 03:02:29
They all require Phone# or Photo ID.
The id is hard to scam since it goes by the actual QR code or Magnetic Strip or whatever technology is behind that states certain ID. 
The phones are easy to spoof if you buy a burner and use that as your accounts proof of existence.
That being said, in order to cash out you can get a burner and then get the receipt or use Mycelium or some other wallet that uses Orbot and switches addresses with every transactions.
What I was really shooting for is to see if anyone used LBC in that area.
I only ask because I would love to start business there, as I believe it would be a great service to the people transmitting money from USA to Mexico vs the standard. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:27:12
Love this
@_date: 2016-10-26 22:04:24
It's called "Axis Mundi", a decentralized black marketplace. 
Look it up on Github
@_date: 2016-10-28 03:59:16
Stop snitching ;)

Think you just birthed a new genre in art, "CryptoArt".
