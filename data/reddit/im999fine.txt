I'm not so sure of that. I do like the idea of using the extra energy for mining, but you could (in theory) use the extra electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. However, this doesn't deal with subsidies. 
Musk also looks to vertically integrate his systems. He has the batteries for the home, why not add in solar panels? I just hope he can start turning a profit and succeed.

But if higher denomination bills are removed e.g. in the US, won't people be pissed that they now need to carry fat wallets of $20s around?
I am concerned about the anonymity part. You shouldn't need a computer to exchange with someone. 
From my perspective as a cashier, most of this "war on cash" is a byproduct of the ease of using your phone or watch to pay for your goods/services. However, many people still fork over physical cash in order to pay.

In other terms, half of a very powerful nuclear plant's output, or a large coal/ng plant output, or a few hundred wind turbines, or thousands of solar panels.

Because China is power hungry- electric power hungry. Any power they can add to their grid is power they can use to power their economy. Solar helps as well as it has excellent opportunities to be used with other generation types/storage.
