If you become a market maker on [joinmarket]( you can earn for participating in coinjoins, but you need some technical skills and a lower time preference.
On the other hand, if you have a high time preference you can use joinmarket to create coinjoins on demand where all the parameters (participants, amount, etc.) are editable by you. Unlike wasabi where you have set amounts and participants. Joinmarket fees are typically lower, but so is the anonymity set (however that's debatable because neither implementation can prove that the participants are not sybils).

That is all true, and it is well known that a [single coinjoin is not very effective]( I would argue that a single monero tx isn't that useful either. Churning (making txs to yourself) is annoying to say the least, and involves a lot of nuance if you want to get benefits from it. If the coin was worth more it would be costly too.
That's why I prefer using joinmarket as a maker for years. You earn fees the entire time and you'll end up in hundreds to thousands of coinjoins.

With monero you have no idea where your decoys came from either. They're just random transactions from the chain. Most of which probably came from exchanges or agencies/blockchain analytics spamming txs to become your decoys.

With Qubes you can use JoinMarket from an isolated VM that has no network connection.

You could look at the guide I linked, it's explained in the the intro. The short answer is that Qubes passes the necessary ports from the bitcoind VM (which is bitcoind's 8332 and joinmarketd's 27183, 27184).
Because of the client-server setup of JoinMarket, you can run the daemon on the networked VM and the wallet on the network isolated VM. Yield generator only needs to interact with the wallet and simply pass the info to the daemon on 27183, which is connected to the IRC from the bitcoind VM.
