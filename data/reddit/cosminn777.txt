Because f*** your privacy!
@_date: 2016-04-03 15:01:42
I would avoid everything India related. Just giving a free tip here.

How much s**t like this needs to happen until people stop using Coinbase? I hope not much.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:42:10
Amen to that!
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:54:23
The man is an ETH shill
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:12:28
2018: let's overthrow governments, the pyramidal system, end wars, end taxes, decentralize society, etc.
Exit the corrupt system, the choice is yours, the revolution will not be violent.

Andreas the ETH shiller.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:34:44
Indians? So many scammers out there in India, no thx!
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:08:03
But can it run Crysis?
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:03:22
He's just a seller, selling shiny dreams to poor people, he's not a trader, almost all his calls failed.
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:31:18
It's like snake oil
@_date: 2018-10-30 10:58:42
Selling scamcoins like eth and ltc in plain sight.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:11:58
Ethereum not Bitcoin, makes better sense for his new job as ETH shiller.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:29:33
He's just an eth shiller
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:01:08
@_date: 2016-09-13 12:38:26
"Embrace regulations" ?
Fuck you!
@_date: 2018-03-25 08:11:44
What is the ETH shilling roadmap?
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:12:07
He became a shill for Ethereum
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:32:06
He became an eth shill.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:33:05
How do they prevent double-spending?
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:57:55
BTC funds invested in writing a book about ETH, good job supporters!
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:48:57
Amazing! Congrats!
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:42:44
Can they withdraw what they bought or are they just virtual numbers in your account?

Bitcoin is not vapour, you can check it on the network. Wherecan you check when you buy Skrill Bitcoin? Where is the proof that they hold that Bitcoin for me?
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:25:57
Intelligent argument! You must be a bright human being!
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:44:07
Yes, you are not actually buying anything. It's just a virtual number, vaporware.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:31:39
Andreas became a shill for Eth.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:36:14
There is nothing there in your Skrill account, there is no Bitcoin when you buy it.
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:15:47
Billionaire scamcoin shiller.
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:26:23
Andreas is an ETH shiller and a scamcoin pumper.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:08:55
Just do the hashing algo change so we can mine with our graphics card and the issues will be fixed! Give power back to users please!
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:43:26
What you bought it's just a number, a virtual number in Skrill database for your account and not actual crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:33:54
It's the same for everyone, the market has an awesome habit of screwing everyone.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:31:42
The ETH shill arrived in India
@_date: 2018-04-04 05:39:08
Scammer screams 'Scammer'
@_date: 2016-10-29 16:32:54
Good mobile site, what's the purpose of the app when you can have the same functionality in any browser?
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:34:19
Magnus Trading broke second round of newly managed accounts.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:16:00
Looking forward for some ETH shilling.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:00:07

@_date: 2017-07-12 21:01:19
Not even one and I'm trying since yesterday.
