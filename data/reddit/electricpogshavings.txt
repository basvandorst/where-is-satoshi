It would cost a bank, state, or just a random Russian enthusiast a pretty insignificant amount of money to break things bad enough, for long enough, to "debase" and effectively "seize" all btc. That's pretty fragile, in the short term. 
Nobody can clog the mempool to render valueless or non-transferable my real estate, and in a country like Canada, it's pretty much unseizable unless I'm being a lawbreaking weiner. Why are you so worried about seizure?

The only thing that really matters as long as the mining reward is significant is the fiat price of btc, since miners cash out immediately. The chip efficiency gains are nullified by the difficulty increase. 
We don't have time, carbon-wise, to keep adding more chinese coal power chasing CNY/USD for the next 20 years.

How many times does it have to be said that computing chips make really poor, inefficient heaters? There's a reason this hasn't happened yet.

Butterfly labs had no products at all, lol. 
Heat pumps are a great reason this hasn't happened yet. And the fact that my electric heater won't be obsolete in a year. 
Color me incredibly skeptical. Your idea would of course be better than just wasting the heat as most mining does now, but PoW is an environmental catastrophe no matter which way you slice it.
