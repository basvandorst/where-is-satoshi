So during your 24 hours of waiting for a payment you had a dispute open as well? did you submit sufficient evidence that you haven't received payment in that time period? Because that is what I did for both my disputes I have had so far, and both times there was no need to the arbitrator to ask me anything so they just close the case in my favor. I agree that it takes a little more proactive work to make sure you dont get screwed, but compared to most p2p exchanges its worth the extra work to not get outrageous rates on crypto.

really? ive used it many times to buy bch. as bitcoin transfer fees are atrocious especially when your just using small amounts. Ive never had one issue buying BCH. but this was my first time Selling BCH and its been a complete shit ride LOL. Why does everyone hate on this site tho, is there something im missing?

You are saying a hard fork of bitcoin has no relation with bitcoin... do you see the problem in that logic?
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:32:05
doesn't matter how they were developed, it is simple fact that bitcoin cash is a hard fork of bitcoin. doesn't seem like you even know the technology your trying defend/slander.

ah I see, what wallets do you suggest that will let us set our own transfer fees?

I have definitely transferred on the weekend before, never experianced 1sat/b fees..

I just use for a cheap and quick way to send crypto to an exchange where I change them into other crypto. Believe me im not stoked at all that Im being forced hold some BCH in stuck in escrow for hours on end..

I mean as far as peer to peer exchanging goes [local.bitcoin.com]( is far better than anything else out! The site works pretty well just gotta realize no KYC is needed to sell or buy so naturually human filth would be gravitated to the exchange also my crypto hard on is not nearly close to hard enough to have a solid opinion on Roger Ver!

not sure local.([bitcoin.com]( is related to bitcoin...? 
crypto enthusiasts are not really the intellectual type huh?

LOL does everyone have to blindly praise bitcoin or if they admit the clear flaws and uselessness of certain technologies and labeled a "hater" 
I dont even keep BCH in high regards, nor do I do with BTC. The circle jerks of hate people of on this sub is some of the most amusing shit I have seen through my time in the crypto world ahaha.

you probably lost the dispute rightfully so, i provided sufficient evidence to prove what ive been saying. and as a result I won the dispute and got my funds.
