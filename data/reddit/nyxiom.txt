Thank god. I love crypto, but 99% of the things advertised on FB have been scams. Not to mention really annoying to see constantly in my feed.

Huh? Do you know anything about crypto or how they work? Almost all have very strict supply limits.

GDAX doesn't make it easy but don't sweat it if you don't see it showing up in the wallet right away, it's taking a while for tx's to go through right now.

5% dip "crash" lol
We need 30-40% correction, we've been going up too fast. Course if we saw that people would lose their minds even though that would be a healthy correction and a really good sign for future all-time highs. People don't know trading and just panic without understanding how this stuff works.

This is so blown out of proportion. You are at no more risk by telling people that you have a lot of Bitcoin than you are telling people you have a lot of fiat (and let's face it, that's hardly a secret with most people these days).
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:47
No. There are multiple reports on the net about them taking your BTC and never delivering a product. Unfortunately, if you want an ASIC you'll likely either have to pay double on Amazon or eBay or order from Bitmain directly and wait for the next batch.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:59:02
All depends on who you are and how much BTC you have at 500+ BTC you're probably set for life, assuming it doesn't crash. Especially if you don't cash it all out and let it's worth keep growing as the years tick on. Just pulling out as much as you need each year. Even better if you can do some good with it. Live off of it while trying to grow the community and do good for those that need it when possible. That's the dream baby.

Of course not, I mean look at what happened to gold. No one wants that garbage anymore. /s

Just do a limit order on GDAX, it's linked to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:20:22
That will probably clear with that fee, give it a day or two. If it doesn't it will eventually be rejected and returned to your wallet.

Note the 2100 coin high sell wall on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:43:46
When BCH trading opens on GDAX (sometime today, possibly very soon), there will likely be a lot of volatility. There is a chance we'll see a BTC flash crash, if there is, buy it quick. It won't last long and BTC is going to go up quite a bit.

Don't worry, I forgot about a stop loss I had on quite a bit of coin I had in an exchange, causing it to sell at $14k, then I rebought at $18k, lost a ton of the btc I had in the exchange. Just to look now and see if I'd have waited I could have corrected the loss.
Lost thousands of dollars and months of gains in a matter of seconds. Still holding what I have left though. Shit happens.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:56:57
No, probably just $17,500, that's the next support level. If it falls below that then next support is $15,000. Neither of those supports has been properly tested though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:28:55
Nope, don't know anything about them really. They accept credit card payments though, so at least you could try a chargeback if need be. Always be extremely careful of any site that isn't properly vetted and requires payment in crypto as the only accepted method.
Still, I'd be wary of this site too unless someone else has more info about them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:30
Only on GDAX/Coinbase. This is gonna crash hard, freaking great for people selling on that exchange though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:33:58
I use tradingview to monitor everything I trade. I have a few scripts I use, support levels are just based on what's been tested over time though.

@_date: 2017-12-19 03:19:45
They are crap, but I don't have much issue with them. Frankly, all current exchanges are crap though. Gemini is OK, but a lot of people can't get accepted for reasons Gemini won't disclose.
Frankly, when it comes to current exchanges it's all about choosing the lesser evil, none of them are really worth a damn.

Yah, people calling the dip and breakout based on 5-15 minute candles (if they even know how to read them). Can't call it either way at the moment, too much going on with the technicals.

Not yet, we need to go lower. Hoping for a support test at $15k, then we can continue to the moon.

You can't just rely on one person to tell you how to invest, you need to learn how to do it yourself. Tone is right a lot of the time, and wrong sometimes too. I'm sorry you lost money, but no one can say for 100% certainty what will happen with a given asset, else all investors would be rich. Learn candles, trading patterns, how to read a TD indicator, trading in general. Then use experienced traders to help advise what you think you already know, rather than having them tell you what you don't know.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:05
That's why you should follow people from all camps, not just one. Use your head.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:17:22
That $1000 jump in price though... While I'm sure these will still remain profitable enough to break even and make a bit extra, at that price I expect many will just be ebay flipping them.

Seriously? People think it should be OK to evade paying capital gains taxes? Just pay your taxes and you have nothing to worry about. The IRS isn't trying to seize funds they aren't due through simple, established, tax law. If anything they are being pretty damn lenient here.
The only issue here is that it's difficult to know what is and isn't capital gains, if I transfer $20,000 from Coinbase to a private wallet, I'm not making any money and it isn't a capital gain, but Coinbase has no way of knowing I sent it to a wallet I control vs if I sold it. So it's considered a taxable event, which is a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:05:42
Because markets like these aren't completely random like some people seem to think they are. For those who don't understand them and get headaches just looking and a candle chart, let alone trying to understand what the candles are telling them to expect, I guess just buying at random times makes sense.
But we can predict with some measure of accuracy what the price will do based on market movements. Investing isn't completely luck based, there is a lot of skill involved, though of course there is a measure of luck as well, you can estimate with relative certainty what the market will do, but in the end, it can surprise even the most seasoned investors. Still, with practice and understanding, you can win a lot more trades than you lose.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:40:30
Yeah, I prefer to look at what the candles have been doing and draw in my own support levels, though you could use a support/resistance indicator script on Tradingview as well. As for the ticker, it depends on what you mean by "real", I usually look at the BTCUSD Bitstamp or Coinbase charts. Though the CME futures chart is one I look at a lot too now that it's available, that one is under BTCF2018

No, fork isn't going to hurt you. But you should keep your coin in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:25:25
Sell if you need the money. Ultimately if you have a small amount of coin it makes sense to simply hold until the value is high enough to make it work selling part of your coin. If you have enough coin eventually you can sell some and hold some. Sell enough to pay for things while holding enough to get more returns, buying more in a dip. If you sell all of your coin you're just taking yourself out of the market. No reason to do that unless you need the money to survive. Otherwise you only sell what you need and allow what you leave behind to keep growing.
So to answer the last question, the idea of holding and buying dips is to eventually have enough coin to be able to sell and buy dips without leaving the market entirely (aka selling all coin)
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:01:12
Does this mean they'll have it back in stock soon? Currently pallets of all flavors show as out of stock on their site.

I probably would have cashed out, but my buddy who's kicking himself started a merchant marine job when he first heard about Bitcoin and it was around $100. After that he spent the next a few years on a ship, nearly all expenses paid and little access to a computer or internet with which to cash out even if he wanted. He would have held, even if he didn't want to lol

Woo, this sub is being flooded by BCH supporters, it's as if they don't realize that 49% of their trade volume in the last 24 hours has been from a single Korean exchange, which suggests price manipulation. Their value will tank once that exchange backs off.

I bought another $500 at the ATH, and I'm already sad I didn't wait. But I'll hold. No biggie.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:42:02
Just buy when you're comfortable. In the long term, it doesn't matter. Say you buy at $6,000 and then it drops to $1400 (it won't but just for sake of argument), then yeah, that sucks, because you could have gotten so much more. But you'll still be in the green when it goes to $10k.
Sure, it's better to buy lower, but no one can predict that, so all I'm saying is don't beat yourself up if you buy and it dips more after, just hold, buy more if you can, but hold and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:36
And it's true of all cryptos that have miners. There is no winner. But there are changes in the pipe like Lightning Networks that will make things happen. And cryptos like BCH don't have that trick up their sleeves.

Except for when there isn't, as we've been hitting new ATHs for almost a month and a half now with no real dip (I don't consider I negligible $100-200 drop a "dip")

It's easy to call out things that fit your own agenda, at least get your facts right.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:01:01
But no one is? Scaling is important, yes, but not right now. Virtually no one is using crypto when compared to literally anything else in the financial space. Adoption is ridiculously tiny. And by the time we do need scaling, we'll have the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:08
I'll admit, recent events do make that a bit shakier. But I stand by it as a strong possibility still. Some investors think we've peaked for the year already and will see the $10k+ level early next year, some think we still might see it this year. Either way, it will likely be only a give or take of a month or two anyway. End of December or end of January/February. Not long to wait really.
Don't take my word for it though, I've been in this a long time, but so have a lot of other people and everyone is saying different things, Bitcoin is hard to predict. Just strap in and enjoy the ride, we'll get there.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:25:37
That wasn't my point. I was pointing out that fee was a tiny percentage of the amount sent and not really a big deal. Of course it might be a bigger deal on a smaller tx, but honestly, if $1 is gonna break your bank or is "outrageous" then I don't know what to say, if you're moving such a small amount that $1 is a large percentage then I have to wonder why you're moving it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:14:06
No one can say if it will fall or not. We can look at history, where the last fork saw very little change in the value of BTC post fork and then a fairly quick rise in value. That history suggests this fork won't be followed by a drop. But no one can say for sure, if we could even predict such things with moderate accuracy we'd all be rich.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:47:32
January is gonna be interesting, those like myself sold off our Bcash long ago since we had our BTC in personal wallets. But a lot of people kept their BTC in Coinbase/GDAX and as such it's become a massive loaded gun just waiting to go off in January as people that already held BTC, supporting it then and still supporting it now, dump their Bcash for more BTC.
Course it could go the other way too, but I keep seeing people wanting to dump their currently locked away Bcash, rather than buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:57:00
If Ver dumps then whales in BTC holding BCH from the fork will dump. Moves and counter moves. That's just speculation, of course, but It's always been like this. FUD makes a certain kind of trader a lot of money off the backs of those with weak hands and little experience in the space.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:48:51
Coinbase is fine, though you may need to wait for the issues people are having with trades today to be corrected. The big thing is to make sure you move your BTC into a wallet you control as soon as you can. Don't leave it sitting in exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:22:03
By the massive BCH dump amidst Bithumb going down causing over $1000 drop in BCH value in 10 minutes proving just how much of a non-organic growth it was to begin with? No, not really.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:32
Of course, this is sarcasm. But yeah, BTC will be fine and go to new highs. However, BCH is going to do well too imo. It seems like a lot of people feel like one has to die for the other to rise, and that's simply wrong. One will be worth more than the other (and let's face it, that one will be BTC), but both have value and neither will die.
BCH has good things going for it as a medium of exchange, while BTC has good things going for it as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:47:25
Yah, people on several platforms are having a hard time trading right now. Might be contributing to the dip as it seems a lot of people want to buy the dip right now but they can't.
Hopefully it's all sorted soon.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:38:50
Personally, I doubt it will drop below $6000. But it could. In any case, it will recover, just as it always has. Bitcoin has "died" what... 100 times? Bitcoin is resilient.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:48:26
In fact the *more* Bcash is worth then and the *less* BTC is worth, the more of a shot it's gonna be, just means you get even more BTC for dumping your Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:12:29
I think people should expect it to keep dropping btw, and that's fine. I expect around $5000-6000 is where we'll bottom out over the next month, and then early next year we'll bounce back and break $10k.
There is a lot of pumping going on right now on top of an expected price correction. Nothing to see here, sell and take a loss, or hold and take a win. Just know you may need to hold for a few months, but if you do, you'll be glad you did.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:46:25
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:01:46
Coinbase appears to be having some issues right now, has been for a few hours from what I understand. I'm sure it will be resolved soon. But yah, always best to keep coin in your own wallet. Course that would require transferring it out of Coinbase if you bought it there which most people don't appear to be able to do right now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:51:55
Yeah, $6000 isn't likely. I'll be surprised if it goes that low. But cryptos are volatile and when it comes to investments I prefer to expect the worst and hope for the best. Honestly, I think buying at $6500 would be a safe bet if it hits that. I wouldn't make any solid price calls right now though, just keep an eye on it today.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:11:21
A temporary one sure, but let Roger Ver support shit coin, we have plenty of whales in Bitcoin that remain loyal.
Of course how many of them that still have BCH they're able to dump is anyone's guess, most whales don't keep their coin in exchanges so they didn't have their BCH locked away. Course I assume a lot of them just didn't care about it anyway and never bothered to do anything with it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:46:20
You are correct that a slower rise and bigger drop will happen if 2x wins, but the likelihood of that happening is astronomically low. It's losing more and more support every day. I don't think 2x will die like some people do, I expect it will stand on its own as a new coin, but it's not going to dethrone BTC, and even if it did, you'll get an equal amount of 2x as you have in BTC at the time of the split. So you win either way in the long run. But it is about the long game, always has been.
If losing your current amount of BTC would put you in a really bad spot then sell it now to be safe and buy back later. I think you'll be fine either way, but crypto is volatile and it's always better to be safe than sorry, that being said, dumping coin in a panic that you can afford to lose anyway is foolish. But if you can't afford to lose it, then be safe and cash it out. You can always buy back later, even if it is at a higher price.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:49:17
Miners have switched lanes, and it doesn't matter in the slightest. Shortly after Bcash launched more than 50% of miners switched to it. Read that again, it's not a typo. More than 50%. I remember having 12-16 hour tx times for my BTC then.
And guess what? Miners switched back after what was essentially a pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:16:26
Pretty chill, especially with the massive amounts of BCH that is likely to be dumped on January 1st when a bunch of loyal Bitcoiners get access to it.
GDAX/Coinbase is a loaded gun pointed at BCH, just waiting to go off on January 1st.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:59:23
Yep, just as they did shortly after the fork that created BCH. More than 50% of BTC miners moved to BCH then, just to move back to BTC once it was more profitable.
Same old song and dance. Been here before, and it will play out the same now as it did then, with a BCH spike followed by a crash. All while BTC rides the inverse and rises to dominance in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:06:53
Don't worry, you'll get it back and then some when CME futures launch.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:11:34
Don't. There is no point mining BTC unless you live in China where the electricity costs are low. Everywhere else pretty much the cost to run the miners will exceed the amount of BTC mined. I suggest you look at mining a different crypto or selling hash rate via NiceHash.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:43:05
Oh I'm not saying it isn't a good thing for the BCH folks. It is, and I hope they get some money out of it. I'm just saying that I wouldn't expect it to stick.
I follow and closely though and while over here a good portion of the threads are about Bitcoin and love for it, most of the posts I see over there are hate on Bitcoin and attacks on anyone that holds it. is toxic as fuck, makes look like saints, which is saying something sometimes. It's like every other post there is them trying to justify investing in BCH over BTC. Not why BCH is a good investment, but why it's a better investment than BTC.
Just pick one and invest. If you're that afraid that you're picking the wrong team that you're gonna spend copious time justifying your choice then maybe you should think long and hard about if you want to invest at all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:43:49
Gonna go to the moon. People keep freaking out like this hasn't happened before. Miners are moving to Bcash instead of BTC. Guess what? They did that before too, shortly after Bcash launched more than 50% of miners moved to it and pumped it up while BTC crashed.
And then BTC skyrocketed while Bcash crashed.
We've done this dance with Bcash before and came out on top. We will again. And besides, after a massive ATH, a $3000 jump in less than 30 days, people are freaking out over this drop? It's peanuts.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:39:55
Indeed, BTC will be fine and hit new highs. But judging this recovery on 20 minutes of activity is a bit odd. It's too soon to be making calls. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:11:51
Or you just keep buying a little bit here and there over the years and watch as your funds grow. I once thought the same as you. And while I don't like talking about how much specific coin I have, I will say that I'm glad I didn't listen to myself.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:05:44
No kidding, a 0.012% fee? How will BTC ever survive? /s
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:00:09
If your BTC (or any crypto for that matter) is in an exchange then you don't actually own the wallet it's in. If the exchange gets hacked, or someone on the inside decides to run away with the private keys to the wallets, or anything like that, then your money is gone. Unrecoverable.
It's happened before with even the most trusted exchanges (google Mt Gox). It's just better to have the money in a wallet you control, that way you only lose your coin if you fuck up, not if someone else does.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:53:10
When BCH's difficulty goes up the value of BCH is going to need to soar while BTC tanks or they'll lose all those miners they are bragging out "taking". Miners won't mine at a loss for long.
Maybe that's why Roger moved so much BTC to an exchange? Still, it's a gamble for them.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:26:46
Your Bitcoin is always safest in a personal wallet. That being said, GDAX has been really reliable thus far and I use it regularly. GDAX will also be supporting the new fork which will make trading it easy. Shouldn't be anything special you need to do before the fork GDAX will make both coins available to you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:56:25
Pssh, we are going to the moon. But no one, not even those of us that have been in Bitcoin for years can tell you when. And we all know that it could also go to zero. We just decide which side of the coin we choose to believe in.
As others keep saying, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If your money is in an exchange, then use stop orders if you are worried.
I don't think it's a bad idea to listen to people's opinions on where BTC will go and when, but it's important to remember they are just that, opinions. Educated guesses by some, but guesses all the same.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:52:08
What, exactly, would be the reasoning for $7600 as a floor? $7500 maybe, but that's even a weak floor. $5000 remains our hard floor until we break $10,000, then it will shift to $7500.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:31:34
Indeed, we need a double top. $7600 is the breakout price, and a solid time to buy, until then there will be waves of FUD surrounding BTC and it's quite possible it will take another dip. Meaning a buy now could just be losing the opportunity to buy the dip. Either time the dip (which as I said, is hard to do), or buy the breakout. Of course, in the long run, it doesn't really matter, BTC will go up. But there really isn't anything going on right now with the price that makes it a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:34:05
Grats, it may not be a Roadster, but it's still a damn nice car.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:07:59
To some extent, yes, but the fork won't kill Bitcoin. The value may jump after the fork, or it may fall. But even if it falls, it will go back up, just as it always has. We saw people jumping ship like crazy the last fork, the FUD was insane. And here we are, a few months later with Bitcoin worth nearly 3x what it was then and those FUDers out a lot of money, the price they pay for a lack of understanding of Bitcoin's history and resilience.
They run off to Litecoin and ETH, mistaking smooth sailing for good sailors.

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:46:58
Bithumb is back up, expect BCH to go back up as the pumping resumes, BTC will likely drop a bit more, but we've seen the true colors of the BCH pump and anyone who was worried should rest easy. It won't last.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:04:06
Withdrawing fiat is usually no issue, even when to comes from a sale of BTC (and by usually I mean issues have never happened to my knowledge).
Holding BTC in an exchange long term is where the risk lies really, but no one with a significant amount of BTC is holding it in exchanges.

If you have a huge sum of money suddenly enter your bank account or if you suddenly buy a big house and a $200,000 car on your $40k a year salary then uncle sam is gonna start asking questions.

$6850 isn't a breakout price though. I'm waiting for a double top before I celebrate. We'll get there, hopefully soon. But it's safer to buy the breakout then to try and time a dip right now (and we are still very much in a dip)
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:34:03
I've lost thousands in the last few hours. I'm not sweating it and neither should you. We still have CME futures coming and great stuff for BTC. This is a temporary market hiccup. Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:28:19
We'll hit close to $10k by the end of the year. Probably more if CME futures launch by then. This current dip is more due to Bithumb fucking with the market than it is due to anything that will actually stick or make a real difference in the value.

I hope 0.038 BTC (cost of these headphones) is worth $15,000 this time next year! XD
$400,000/BTC would be nice.

There is enough, but I don't think it will actually happen. With Bitcoin you need to actually be responsible for your money. No FDIC to bail you out if an exchange goes under. No customer service department to recover your mistakenly sent funds.
People don't like having to be responsible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:44:15
Yep, but a $1000+ drop in a matter of minutes, shows how un-organic and non-sustainable their growth is.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:50:02
Why not? Bitcoin has never failed to recover from a crash, just a lot of people that freak out about it and panic sell when it does, only to see how much money they lost a month or two later when it's hitting a new ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:03:52
Right now, yes, you're correct. No doubt. But that's looking at the here and now rather than the big picture. BTC can be used for any transaction as it scales, and it will scale. But other cryptos have a shortsighted view and think we need to be able to do tons of tx's a second at low fees when in truth there just isn't enough adoption for that to matter and there likely won't be for quite a while.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:58:09
Yah, this is a lot of people once they get BTC, or any crypto. Thus they lose money, thinking they know investing from an evening or a few days of research, calling every rise a shot to the moon and every fall the end.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:45:56
The point is that miners switched to BCH because it was 1.3x more profitable for them to mine than BTC, however, BTC is rapidly becoming more profitable to mine than BCH. It won't be long before they abandon BCH and come back to BTC. Just a repeat of what they did when the fork first happened. Most miners aren't loyal to any one crypto, they are loyal to their wallets.
And when they do come back, txs go through much more quickly again and tx fees plummet.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:42:07
I'm guessing $6000 at the worst. I doubt it will go down that far, but I wouldn't rule it out. That being said, CME futures will be huge, even though some people don't like the idea of them. They will bring a bubble, likely a 2-3x rise in the price of BTC. And I'm not the only investor that thinks so.
Just hodl, this drop won't last too long. In the early days, I panic sold and lost so much money as a result. Thankfully, I learned my lesson.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:35:38
While I'm sure this post isn't serious, I can't imagine the stupidity involved with keeping that much coin in an exchange and not a private wallet XD
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:56:27
This is always a good idea if you aren't actively trading them. Your coins are safer in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:55:17
Yah, these things are amazing and pay for themselves quick... Well that is until they all start shipping and the difficulty has a huge spike as a result. Making them swiftly just as worthless to anyone not in China as any other miner.

There are crypto millionaires on Reddit, some have shown image proof, but most prefer to be very careful about letting people know how much they have.

Yes, but it's hard to predict the future of each of the currencies. The future for Bitcoin looks bright. I don't have much into ether but it's looking good too, they just need to overcome the recent security breaches.
Ultimately it's about being patient and able to hold for the coin to gain. It's possible Bitcoin could fall drastically soon, but I believe, given it's history, it will rise again. My predictions, based on nothing but the current state of things (BIP91 ect...) and the history of the coin is that we hit $4000 by the end of the year, possibly $5000. Though that might be somewhat optimistic. But then again, we're already up $1000 from about a week ago. So assuming the upcoming changes don't derail that (and I don't think they will) things are looking good. The last few months have been a bit of a roller coaster though lol
It's an exciting time for Bitcoin, but then again, it always is ;)
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:14:05
Hard to say, I sent my coin from GDAX (same as Coinbase) over 5 hours ago and it hasn't hit my wallet yet :/
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:01:41
No one can guarantee anything, crypto is a volatile thing. However, historically every time Bitcoin has fallen, it's gotten back up. If you are able to hold in the case of a drop it's almost certain you will gain.
But this is just based on the history of the coin over the years, no one can predict the future.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:38:50
It could be simply a poorly managed scramble. As for the other exchanges, a lot aren't going to support BitcoinCash at all so they don't need to do much on the user side. As for those that will, we just have to wait and see.
Could it be something worse? Of course. Hence why everyone should use personal wallets to store their coin, not exchanges, but I'm not too worried, course my coin is in a personal wallet and I use GDAX when trading so BTC-e doesn't really impact me anyway, just through whatever it does to the coin as a whole. I just think we should hold the fud until we know more.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:23:51
The same can be said for fiat money too. Fiat is just paper. No more, no less. It only has the value we place on it.
But I do agree, gold is safer than both bitcoin and fiat. However it also doesn't have the potential for as much gain. It's safe, but safe isn't always the most profitable. Sometimes you gotta be willing to take the risk in order to win. That being said, no one should buy more bitcoin than they can afford to lose, not because they will lost it per say, but because it's just not smart to put yourself in a hole. Just buy what you can afford.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:49:07
People still nervous about the fork and BTC-e going down unexpectedly with no real explanation for what is going on.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:14:17
Most likely BTC-e is simply preparing for the split. Prices will fall, but not much (at least in the grand scheme of things). I do feel this is a good time to hodl though anyway. Prices are down, no reason to sell right now unless people just want to take a loss on a coin that historically always recovers.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:34:50
Need to hodl
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:11:12
I see a big crash incoming, not really unexpected, but lots of people will probably panic sell only to regret it later. Even so I don't think it'll get quite that low. Probably around $1800 at the lowest.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:39:00
Anyone who's followed Bitcoin for more than a month knows a drop like this isn't anything to freak out or panic sell over. Hold and you'll get your money back and more. This is just normal Bitcoin being normal Bitcoin. Nothing shocking, nothing worrisome. If anything it's a great chance to buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:31:04
This isn't completely accurate, not sure how they set limits, maybe by bank? But I was able to do $250 per week with my card while my friend could do $500 (set up accounts within 10 minutes of each other)
However I usually just do bank transfers on GDAX when I'm looking to buy, it's slower (up to 4 days) but it works, as long as the prices don't go crazy in that time lol
There's really the only two differences, card is instant with lower limits, bank transfer can take a few days but has higher limits (usually 10-20x higher)
