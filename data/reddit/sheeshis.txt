Someone please write a counter argument to this, I'm curious about it.

So the reason money is worth something is because people trust it is worth something, that's it. The actual cost to make money is less than a penny each note.
So why would people trust that Bitcoin is worth something? Well it offers some good alternatives to fiat. 
When you said the guy wanted millions not bitcoin, you mean he wanted things that he could buy with those millions. But if Bitcoin is exchangable for products and services like fiat than having one or the other makes no difference except that with Bitcoin, it's potentially quick, easier, faster, cheaper (hopefully after some forks), and especially for big money transfers over seas they won't charge you 10 percent of 100000 dollars which is a big chunk.

That is very interesting.. How did you find out about that 100k up front? And who does that money go to? Thanks

Even though, won't they sell it? If they hoard too much it won't be worth much. Also blockchain has so many altcoins likelihood is more than one will prevail.

I don't think money is pretend. I said it's value is based on the shared belief that it is worth something. The same goes for Bitcoin and other alt-coins. 
I'm not really sure your point, as I'm fairly sure that is something we can agree on.

Ah, so you send to an escrow (which is trusted) and there's no way you can get scammed?

I thought there is a reddit archive that keeps all of the comments even deleted ones.

For some reason escrow says it's not enabled after I sent a request and there's no button to enable it.
Also, I was thinking to go with this guy but he has 80% and being blocked by 2 people. Not sure if this is bad? 
Thanks
