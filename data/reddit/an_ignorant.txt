Cash out? I plan on buying things with it.
I already buy some videogames with it (I'm not a hardcore investor, sue me) so I'm already "cashing out".

I just want bitcoin to be useable as currency again. Fees are crippling and if nothing is done, people may just switch to other cryptos. 
Can't be more excited for lightning

Yes... bitcoin is undervalued
But most importantly it's understated as a currency. People don't buy things with bitcoin anymore, I used to buy games but Steam doesn't take bitcoin anymore.
I used to buy shit but the transfer fees are absolutely crippling.
I want bitcoin to be a currency again. Lightning might be one of the most impactful tech to come.

Can you imagine the horrendously high transfer fees if that happens? 
I want btc to be a currency, not a store of value. People shouldn't be talking about its high prices but about lightning or its use as a currency.
I'm hoping for this "cryptoinvestment" phase to be over soon and turn into an actual cryptoCURRENCY

If you're getting anywhere close to 1k USD in bitcoin please do yourself a favor and buy a hardware wallet. 
I know it's not free, but see it as... insurance.

I martingaled roulette once... made about 3k
Then I martingaled again, I lost 32k.
I know the chances of losing are pretty slim, but when you do it's catastrophical.
