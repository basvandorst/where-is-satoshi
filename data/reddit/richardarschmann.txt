I thought Vitalik worked for Ethereum, I could be wrong

The supply continuously increases and will do so even more when we discover how to mine asteroids

Proof of Work is not long for this world.    I hate to say it, but first-world nations are going to crack down on very power-intensive PoW systems like the existing SHA2 setup for environmental reasons sooner or later.

That won't be an issue, thanks.   It can be withdrawn immediately?

This wouldn't work, Blockstream would just fork the "Bitcoin" chain to a different hash algorithm if 51% of the hashpower became hostile to the point where it was executing double spends.

The fees are too damn *low*: maybe if they charged more they could upgrade their infrastructure into something functional.

People need the bitcoins to send them to Polo to buy alts, not a bull trap

In hindsight, those bitcoins below $1000 actually WERE bargains though;.   Would you buy a $1000 bitcoin today?   I would

The immutability of a currency is usually not tied closely to the ability of a thief to keep what they have stolen.    Even if there was an exploit in the DAO contract, what happened would probably still count as a "hack" under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (which is a broad and draconian law).   American prosecutors would most likely interpret what the DAO hacker did as a crime if they ever caught them (which they won't).
There is a stilted view amongst certain individuals in this community that anything contract language technically permits is legally valid.   Under U.S. law, a unilateral (where only one party is aware) mistake in a contract that is *unconscionable* is grounds for voiding the contract.    The threshold for unconscionability are terms that are so overwhelmingly one-sided that none would agree to it were they aware of it.   The DAO hacker's terms (they get everything) are clearly unconscionable, and thus the contract must be voided (through the hard fork, in this case).

This is bad for Bitcoin's continued mass-market acceptance.   We should contact Blockstream and have them ban Dave from using the platform, or perhaps we would have to contact the fiat exchanges to get them to deny him accounts there.
Bitcoin being used to fund this sort of thing is a very bad idea.
