You might be one.  Shills are certainly here.  You just want a smoking gun of someone caught red handed in this exact sub, which is a tall order to ask.  It is not hard to remain anonymous as a shill.  Then there are the shills who simply work at government jobs and are natural shills because they need to defend their job and justify their tax payer funded salaries.  The evidence is everywhere, try researching the topic:

You're right brother.  America used to a place for freedom, but not anymore.  The truth is America no longer exists, since the goverment has been usurped by corporations and bankers that have deemed the constitution void.  The people have been brainwashed by the public education system and television.  
One thing to help you understand the problem with the American people is that America was so rich and prosperous because of our freedom in the past.  This wealth made America a healthy host for the parasitic fascist government to suck our blood.  It attracted a lot of parasites, and the government has grown and grown like a fat bloated tick.  Most of the good jobs left in America are government jobs, so most of these people have incentive to not ask questions or stand for freedom.  
There are a minority of awake Americans that can still make a difference, but the true solution is to build and use a new system like Bitcoin, and let the old system collapse on its own.  Sadly this is the only hope now since the majority of Americans are hopelessly stupid.

What if someone gave you a bunch of bitcoins years ago, or you got them from a faucet or bought them privately and cannot give proof of purchase??? Game over then.

Freedom is the natural agenda of honorable human beings.  So don't try to imply having a libertarian agenda is somehow a bad thing.

This is true and by design.  It is called the Cloward-Piven Strategy and is designed to overwhelm the system and make everyone poor so they can bring in what they think will be a socialist utopia: [Cloward-Piven Strategy](

The evidence is your trollish shill-like posts.

I understand the point that it is off topic, but I am glad its here.  For one it has relevence because many people who attack Bitcoin, do it because they hate libertarianism. For example Paul Krugman and other statists, and one of their cringeworthy arguments is always "who will fix the roads."
