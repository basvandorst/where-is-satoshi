need fast cpu, ram, hdd/ssd, bandwidth - i have an old pc that has taken 3 weeks so far while my main rig takes just a few hours for the whole shebang.

hope you submitted a report and waited 2 weeks, got my lost btc after 17 days.

in usa they are taxing going from one crypto to another, good luck
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:03:55
it will most likely go through soon and bitpay will have to refund you causing another high fee, cause newegg order canceled. :( (had this happen on shapeshift)  Need to pay high enough fee to get it in next block with these services.

2 weeks heh
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:26:52
ya, it's very volatile and most wallets are set to over pay the fee and there is spam and others gaming it atm, just messy currently.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:35:25
isn't that the dapp's fault of bad programming?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:58:28
rebroadcast/retried, it will stay in the mempool until a miner thinks it's worth enough to mine if it keeps getting rebroadcast , you can ReplaceByFee to the same address or ChildPaysForParent to a different address paying higher fee to override the unconfirmed transaction, or you can not rebroadcast and wait 2 weeks for it to be dropped from mempool. If I understand this shenanigans correctly that is. I don't think it's gonna go down to 50 sats a byte tho, so miners will prob skip it for a while now, anything is possible.
 estimate better next time, pay a little more if it's urgent

doesn't matter, the network will always be spammed, will always be attacked.

you know that game where you have a baseball bat and you each put your hand on top of each other and the one at the top wins.. well, it's a long way up and some can make bigger jumps to get ahead and people follow

@_date: 2018-01-06 19:44:01
usually your wallet app will do it when its open and anyone with the tx id that you posted can rebroadcast it

check out bitcointalk forums, this was all predicted 5+ years ago and they say exactly what is going to happen and has happened. it's damn interesting.

the end goal is spend the bitcoin not cash out to fiat
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:46:59
mass adoption is what will create stability, so it's more of ease of use/trust issue with the masses.

As someone who got into crypto when the fork happened, holy shit it was easy to get suckered, its a battle of information and so easy to convince with words stuff that makes sense on the surface but no fucking sense in the whole scheme of things.
