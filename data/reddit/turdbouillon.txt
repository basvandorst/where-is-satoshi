He's a total prick. He is right about this though.

I'm going to hit the ATM to get some dollars to buy some weed.
Obviously Wells Fargo should be prosecuted.

I have one that was part of a give away by an eBay seller. Buy a thing, get a bitcoin. At the time they were several for a dollar.

No doubt but those are different problems and to avoid despair we'll need to address them systematically. 
First I need a device I can trust. If you can't trust the ends of E2E encryption then the "wire" is inconsequential.

That's all pretty standard stuff and is what I was trying to convey, I appreciate your added clarification though. Not releasing firmware binaries is *not* a malicious act on Google's part. It is however a serious issue with regards to hardware security.
The "funny" way that Google releases code is that it's binaries first then a wait for the source to be released to/by AOSP. That is not the way open source code is generally handled and for me serves to remind me that Android is not GPL and it's not an open project. Google develops the code largely internally and then "gifts" it as they see fit.
I dislike Android for many technical and design reasons but I loath it for the above reasons. There are however alternatives, both existing and under development.
Now we need a piece of open hardware and some changes to FCC rules regarding software radios... 
Google, especially with their acquisition of Motorola Mobile is in a unique position to release the necessary specs to build truly open device drivers. I hope that they will find that in their interests. *We* as citizens of our various nations will need to be sure to raise the alarms as they continue to try to make the reverse engineering of firmware or even it's willful release, in the case of software radios in the US, illegal.
My OpenMoko is getting a bit dated. ;)

Thanks again for the clarification. Rather than "release" I should have said "pressure to release". I'm not sure that Motorola under Google will release enough handsets to effectively pressure manufacturers to release open drivers or not but I think Google is the only company in a hardware design position who would see the value in that.
The Linux kernel team and their business allies have been successful in convincing many hardware manufacturers to release specs or open drivers.  Almost universally this was for established tech with low profit margins where design cycles had gone long dormant. Things like RAID controllers and other storage components. It's also nearly universal that the open source versions of drivers for those hardware components were more robust and efficient. Hardware companies write shitty drivers, it's almost an afterthought. Later, there was spotty success with GPU manufacturers with intense competition for performance and comparatively rapid release cycles releasing firmware source allowing for the writing of open drivers. I think it was a combination of shitty binaries and lack of feature support for Linux as well as end user demand to get the most out of the hardware that led to source/specs availability. Next stop; mobile SoC and component hardware...
With Google demanding non-buggy hardware support for the Linux kernel under Android I can see them push to optimize that code in house, they forked Java not only for legal reasons but because Java in the wild is a complete turd. The only question is if they'll sign NDAs with TI, Qualcomm, Nvidia et al or if they'll push to have open source drivers released.
Obviously, as a citizen with privacy and security concerns I hope for the later.
Ummm, also... Bitcoin.

Google takes a funny approach to releasing the Android source.
New code is first released as binaries (not human-readable) to the devices. Later the code is released as AOSP, Android Open Source Project. But not all of the code, and none of the many "microcode" binaries that actually talk to the hardware like the radios (cellular, GPS, WiFi) or battery.
You can install directly from AOSP with the intent that you are only running code with freely available source that can potentially be reviewed. However, you would have to compile that code yourself to be certain that it matches the source and the microcode binaries that speak to the hardware are still untrusted "black boxes".
Most of this weeks NSA leaks have involved compromising or replacing that microcode and I'm 100% certain that similar agencies in other heavy tech producing countries are doing the same.
There are projects like Replicant aiming to release open source microcode but they don't have the resources to target more than a handful of devices and reverse engineering some of the hardware is technically illegal in many places.
For my part I usually install Debian on my phones with AOSP contained in a chroot jail that's only running when needed and I've been experimenting with building the Firefox OS stack on that platform. (Very limited success so far but I'm working on it.)
For the record, I still treat my devices as untrusted as there isn't a device or parts to build a device on the market that I trust.
I hope that answers more questions than it raises.
TL;DR: Android is not a trustable platform but unlike iOS, you can do something about that. To an extent... For now. ;)

You shouldn't speak about things you know nothing about. 
Without adequate knowledge you won't know enough to know how silly it makes you look. Which, incidentally is a pretty good analogy for one of the most basic tenets of computer security.
Having vulnerabilities uncovered and then patching them IS the process of security.
But hey, what do I know I'm just a professional in the field. When you write the worlds first bug free 100% secure software just use your 1337 skills to backtrace my IP and tell me about it.
