I confirmed that on myTrezor it works. now let me figure out how to change tip, unless you want to post a bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:58:51
thank you, that clears up everything. Post a public address so i can tip you please. I got rid of my changetip account.
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:22:35
I figured that. I was about to post a picture but he replied. Now its time to start figuring out how keep key does it, and then Case. Case actually says they use Bip45, not Bip44. But I think its the same thing.

Thank you for the suggestions. murbul answered it if you are interested.
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:45:36

@_date: 2015-11-12 01:56:27
it says m/44'/0'/0'/0 is for mycelium, do you have an idea of which one is used for electrum?

Hello! I am going to try this out for my company Bitkee.com . We have been only accepting 100% bitcoin since conception. We do this because its our way of obtaining bitcoin without buying it. Enough about us. Thanks and I hope it works out. Only thing I noticed was the price is $6.64 for flat rate box, on stamps its $6.80 , on USPS its $6.80 and two years ago it was only around $5.50. Did the price really increase that much and how are you able to cut it by $0.16 !?? My brother has been doing the shipping and I just noticed this now.
I just did a test label creation and was hit with an error for invalid "from address". This is because I put in the city and state in the "street Address" section. It looks like your program finds the city/state from the zipcode. I think it works great this way but should be clarified for the non tech person. My only advice is to clarify this in either the error message or before entering the information into the input boxes. Maybe "Street Address Only" or "City &amp; State will be found from zipcode". I like the simple steps from start to finish and everything is clean looking. Good job.
