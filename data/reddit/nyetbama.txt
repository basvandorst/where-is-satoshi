The premise and underpinnings are inherently libertarian, regardless of WHY someone becomes interested.

It's a verification policy which you can bypass with additional documents. It's outline if you go to the verification levels.

I thought it was 11 mutual agreements between 3.6 parties.

You both make excellent points.

Really... sigh.

Ignoring the typo, statements like these are as nonsensical as statements such as "We're going to 0!".

Only if he's pricing in BTC, which he wouldn't be. I do see your point however, just not applicable here.

Brilliant :P

Sell BTC to buy tinfoil hat.

This post is as useless as this comment.

Translation: I'm not even remotely a libertarian and I don't understand the purpose of Bitcoin.

I'm not a fanboy of BTC, but this isn't at all correct. You can set up the instant conversation while offering an additional way to collect money.
If my tenants could only mail me a check, my rental collection rates would go down and my time cost would go up.
That's how I look at adding BTC as an option for any business.
EDIT: I reread your first sentence. But OP indicated a desire to collect/convert immediately. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:58:32
OP is part of the market, but overall I agree that such sweeping statements are useless.
That said, need OP around on days I'm selling.

Did you sell 1.28 BTC? Else, you still have 5 BTC. Serious question which pertains more to how we look at a BTC than anything else.

Just to be clear: An authoritarian regime that uses state media to boast about creating a "Death Star" wants to ban/regulate a currency that represents the free exchange of value, goods and services?
I'll buy two.

I did ALL the things, except for the one thing that is part of the thing.

I believe it has something to do with them being able to read the documents, while we are subject to Bloomberg's continued pessimism. 
Insert Bubble Master Greenspan lecturing BTC users about bubbles here.

I've struggled with this myself as the owner of a few small businesses. 
From the business perspective:
- Savings and/or a premium. Though I wouldn't use the term "circle jerk" as one poster below did, there is both the transaction savings on the processing end as well as the ability to potentially add a premium in pricing. We did about 7% of our sales in 2013 in Bitcoin in one business and about 5% in another. 
- Thie has been covered: But no chargebacks. No risk on your side. 
- Also covered: "Free" advertising
- Improved liquidity / availability of funds. They'll process into your account quicker. Of course it depends on if you're going to speculate by holding, or turn into cash immediately. That depends on your risk preferences and your processor.
Consumer Side
- The first point re: security offered by CC is negated by your own reputation and warranty offered, if any. Not having CC protections doesn't preclude you from offering a similar security in your products.
- If the above fails, you can always pass on the transaction and real savings to the consumer. Incentives, Incentives, Incentives.
- It's "hip". Some people just want to do it because they can.
- IMPORTANT (imo): You are offering a fast, REAL, way to turn BTC into goods and services. Ask one of your customers that has been caught trying to get money out of Mt Gox if they would like to turn their BTC into real goods and services. I think you'll like the answer. 
Mostly, I never viewed it as a either / or type situation. I have limited survey data but it would appear that at least 30% of those paying in BTC would not have bought otherwise. So if you have a plan for what you want from BTC as a payment type (hold or turn into cash at POS) then I don't believe you have anything to lose, and may pick up a few extra sales.
