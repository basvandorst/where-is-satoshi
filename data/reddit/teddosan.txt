Hi all, thanks for the help. It turned out to be the seed for the 2 factor authentication for Coinbase. I will label more specifically from now on.

Well, there isn't really any way to ensure that the browser doesn't keep a record.  For that, you have to rely on two things: 1) You can read the javascript by using developer mode (for Chrome just hit 'F12').  2) That's where using a USB bootable Linux distro on an offline computer could come into play.  You can boot into Linux, start the browser, generate your keys, then shut down the computer.  Then, even if the browser tried to keep a record, it wouldn't matter because the computer is offline and you're only using a single boot for a single purpose.
As per usual, the higher security you want, the more of a pain in the ass it is...

You can (and should) run the generator while offline. 
 
* While connected to the internet, go to 
* Keep your browser open, but disconnect your computer from the internet
* Generate your key pairs (Use "single wallet" or "paper wallet".)
* Print your key pairs
* Close your browser, reboot your computer, reconnect to the internet
Alternatively, you can save the entire website and put it on a USB drive along with a bootable Linux distro.  Then, use an offline computer to boot from the USB drive and open the html file in any browser.
I do NOT recommend using a brainwallet unless you really know how to choose a passphrase correctly.  There have been many cases of brainwallets being hacked lately.  Use a standard paper wallet and put it somewhere safe (maybe two copies...)
