You can't point an ASIC at bitcoind's getwork port. Any decent box now completely overwhelms bitcoind and makes it inoperable. You need to be using stratum or GBT. Nobody can use getwork for anything but testing.

There's no solution. That's the entire problem with trustless, distributed systems.

Nice FUD. How much NXT are you trying to sell?


Nobody uses getwork. No pool allows getwork. Getwork has been deprecated for years. We use stratum now.

Of course it is. It's mentioned in the Satoshi paper. It's part of the design of the thing. It's not something which can be "fixed?".

No. You can't mine or run a full node on a raspberry pi unfortunately. If you want to throw your money somewhere useful, there's a variety of bounties set up by the core developers to further develop the network. There it probably where a contribution will be of most effect.

That's extremely outdated, probably 2012 or 2011 by the looks of it. Check in Project Development on Bitcointalk for more information.
