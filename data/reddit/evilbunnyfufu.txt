my contribution, a few dollars for the future. 
it's more so a thanks, as I have decided to open a wallet for my kid and send part of my mining and just some basic funds into that for the future.

does not include a very important thing, replace the cheap low grade fuse with a good fuse. the fuse's that come with the Cube are a fire hazard.

I can't help you with the current problem, but in the future save the image that you use to scan in the the code to Google Authenticator and then store that image on a flash drive some place. or print them and lock them away or what ever method you feel is best to keep them safe for the long term. you can re-scan that image any time you need to add it back to Google Authenticator.

I think it's a glitch with the chart, it's has been getting bigger and bigger. if you compare it to the current information on coinbase directly you will see none of that stuff is in place. with coinbase you can not set your own price so it's not someone placing low bids or any thing like that.

I got one as well, all the links go back to Coinbase directly, but as Bubbles said, " It serves no purpose and requests no action. Just delete it and open a new bottle of crystal."

I had mine melt and almost start a fire while I was at work, the cube was running on high mode. thankfully my wife smelled the burning plastic and stopped it before it ignited.
