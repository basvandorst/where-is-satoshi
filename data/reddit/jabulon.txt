that will centralize the thing tho
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:33:28
transaction fees make btc hard to work with
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:38:39
then wont btc just vanish? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:46:29
crypto is internet money, not the future

I lost 50 bucks on an altcoin attempt. Never getting in with stored btc again!
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:07:55
people wont trust it as much if its centralized
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:03:18
wouldnt it be a good idea to hire venezuelan for online work? like makign websites and whatnot, then paying with litecoin or w/e

If bitcoin wants to service a global market, something miners would want as well, you have to realize that there is a minimum size of information in each transaction. Atm miners handle about 4k transactions every 10 minutes, but if they want to be an actual competitor, they would have to do hundreds of thousands, if not millions of transactions per block/10min. This means that the blockchain will expand faster, even with better compression, which in turn means fewer and fewer people will bother to host fullnodes.
Then, if fullnodes are so big that only institutions are willing to host them, in case of famine, ww3 or something unexpected, the network would be supressable by shutting down the fullnode hosts, datacenters and educational facilities interested in running 10 terrabyte fullnodes. And if the bitcoin-network doesnt encourage or reward full nodes prior to that period, how will it be able to handle something like that.
Maybe Im overthinking this, but I feel that soon only institutions and businesses will want to have the fullnode, while regular people will just run electrum wallets, and then slowly create a centralized node network, where if someone wanted, they could just shut down the few relevant datacenters and stop people from accessing their funds.

dont call thoughts fud imo
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:15:46
cool idea. In fact, im trying to figure out how to create hash's myself, and how to sign messages.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:30:49
false? how is that false, mining bitcoin is for big investors, not private individuals. something that puts power in the hands of few, not many.
asics are against satoshis dream, "one cpu, one vote", and rather, "100 asic, 1 vote". BTC might be the backbone, but it is not satoshis vision
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:33:56
oh, I just assumed pos/pow was about how the encryption worked, my bad. Dont you think full nodes help to decentralize the system, and that should be rewarded somehow? Like every 100block goes to the full nodes or something. Staying online and 250gb harddrives costs money and provides something too
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:25:24

why can this said to be "brave"?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:49:01
my wallet wont even accept fees under 50 s/b. For it to be 12euro i would need to be a 20 s/b, and what its asking is [100 satoshi/byte](

@_date: 2019-07-14 01:22:25
You should be able to write anything on the chain I think. Just pay the fee and make sure the message is twittwer sized.

i should just use normal money

@_date: 2019-07-24 01:25:03
bitcoin gold too i think, right? bitcoin private? there should be some forks available

And here I am expecting crypto to become the backing of online currency
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:52:31
is it the interest of daytraders that people hold? or do exchanges want people to trade as much as possible.
when will decentralized exchanges become reality
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:36:31
I know for a facts, streets are used to sell drugs. This is why we should throw streetowners in jail
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:37:33
isnt that alot tho
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:27:16
Should offshore bank accounts be allowed? Should we allow mattress funds? Where do you draw the line
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:02:57
Im just saying there should be a fee for hosting full nodes as well as mining. which of the 2 adds more security to the network anyway
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:57:10
eh, you could have people solving captchas and just generate the coins that way
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:09:55
its also not of infinite value, even tho alot of people try to claim so. Thinking that it is, will lead to a bubble and collapse. Idk if its right for it to do so.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:40:13
so china will dominate BTC due to cheap electricity?
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:45:42

Should offshore bank accounts be allowed? When does a mattress' thickness become a problem

he looks like a lunatic
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:02:10
pow is a waste of energy. better with proof of having-a-full-ledger for distributing new coins. maybe a combination? lightning-nodes and GPU only pow? that would be the most decentralized or
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:15:36
soft forks could always add more right?
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:42:11
is the value only in other people bringing more money to the table?
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:12:37
Will btc ever be a use coin? the mining fees are so high, its better to just use a BTC leveraged bank of some kind.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:10:18
hodl sounds so moronic to me. "hodl"? like your saying "hurl" or something
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:23:17
Its a democracy in the end I think, so it could be whatever people think it should be
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:45:38
are offshore bank accounts ok if they are in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:36:36
If you have to pay taxes when the value goes up, should you get money back when it loses value?
Im thinking maybe alot of people have lost money, maybe they are owed some returns
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:50:10
not if it is a blanket refusal
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:39:25
is it wise to try and manipulate the value
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:51:02
what is the meaning of this?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:43:14
block chain block chain block chain
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:32
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:05:19
or you can just have an electrum wallet and spend your resources on mining, as opposed to ssd's and bandwidth. nvm that the network will need access to the ledger
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:46:34
Maybe alot of stolen credit cards are used on coinbase
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:38:11
refusing to sell, is the same as claiming the item has infinite value
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:32:25
why do only miners get btc? when hosting full nodes is just as important for the saftey of the network
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:09:55
you know, just get an electrum wallet instead. like is bitcoin really dependent on charitable hd owners
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:09:22

oh lol mabad

im hoping for sub 7k hehe =P but now im just cruel
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:45:32
Well I know it has people selling, and I know people that get in, slowly become sellers too, but other than that I cant see what use they have
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:53:18
So a way to freeze assets? Like take 1000hours of work at current rates, and then store them as bitcoin, to not get affected by inflation?
Maybe its a way to "bet" against countries like venezuela :thinking: or bet for.
Idk if becoming frozen is a good goal for any currency
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:50:58

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:40
you sound like an expert in the bubble matters hm you advise to hold?
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:03:47
maybe the coin will end up being for internet use only
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:10:27
Sound like it could be cool? Id love to have wow gold leveraged in bitcoin, more so than candy crush points anyway
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:27:18
if you want btc, you have to compete in captchas. nobody can compete unfairly in that

its becoming gold, literally
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:26:57
what site is that
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:13:19
if it goes under 10k, it might be an idea to get some I think
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:44:13
im watching the depth chart at [gdax]( I didnt realize theres more money on bitstamp. I also watch [coincap.io]( for the altcoins, which are ALL going down with btc.
I think in the end, btc will be the gold backing of all the altcoins, and  all sit in an exchange or vault of some kind, while people use altcoins, just like money instead of gold
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:50
[its over]( even GOT memes cant save us now
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:15
lol why not =P 
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:59:07
Its funny how (many) investors suggest you hold, whatever they are trading
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:39
Why are people paying so much for bitcoin? Surely it must be either drug cartels laundering money, or a South-American country struggling with inflation. It cant be all hype surely
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:34:55
Should we allow offshore bank accounts? What about private bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:22:16
hopefully at the bottom of the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:48:50
is it even usable tho, it wants me to pay 80dollars for a minimal transaction. Im not gonna spend 80 dollars for nothing, the fees are WAY too high
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:56
unreal, 11.5 now, how low will go
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:16:23
dont get me wrong, I wont sell the little btc I have, but honestly, if it doesnt solve the problems with being able to use it easily, I dont see it having a permanent place. Which means, eventually one should sell.
Its as asy as this: either it stabilizes and becomes digital gold or, it falls to 0 with people just claiming its valuable
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:40
I know you shouldnt buy when everyone is selling tho
@_date: 2019-07-14 01:16:07
the fees are kinda high
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:35:14
why would anyone limit trade? its madness
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:33
wow, for real?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:36:05
and now its up lol, is it over I wonder
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:36
seems btc is the backbone of most the coins
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:34:49
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:48:31
ok, so segwit works without introducing sidechains then. I was just thinking about it, and I feel if you get to reliant on sidechains, people cant run a full bitcoind alone anymore, thus decentralizing the coin, AND in case of war or w/e, becomes something someone could control, unlike the vanilla bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:34:22
will we need people at all in the end
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:23:26
i mean im in for so little, it would be just as funny to watch it collapse. I dont think it will tho, as there are too many people invested
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:04:55
ask [here]( people will say monero is the best alternative for drug deals right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:57
lol, you shouldnt look at the [coinbase]( reddit then, some are starting to say they are out of funds
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:16:56
someone stop this kim jong il
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:31
pff, nobody believes it big deal just hodl, it will somehow just be viable as currency, even with 100dollar fees
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:09:32
so they expect you to host a full node for nothing? How is that safe long term. Soon enough the ledger will be a terabyte. Who has time and resources to keep that up to date for free.

7k on dogecoin, lets make it moon

no need to hodl when you cant slel
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:30
man, that would be something, tfw you dont upload the little btc you have to an exchange, amirite?
when hodl actually means "dont upload to an exchange".
some interesting days ahead
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:21
atomic swap and lightning gives hope I think. People forget that coins have to be used for something, not just sit there and increase in value, value doesnt just come out of think air like that.
value = useful, btc is only good for entertainment atm
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:33:06
just make sure you get btc in the end, since its becoming digital gold. I used to think altcoins were the future, but no, its btc. altcoin is more fluid, so you can trade with it, but you need btc to call it money
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:34:21
this would be huge I think

as I see it, it could go either way. Either it becomes a digital gold standard, or it just goes to zero at is has no actual use anymore.
do people actually use these, or just hype and buy, hype can last forever, and people are screaming hodl as if its a GOT meme. you cant bet your house on a meme bro!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:33
Ive gathered that bitcoin is bad for small transactions, as the fee will be higher than the sum being sent. As the price goes up, the cost of making transactions will too, and soon, sending any value less than x, will just not be worth.
Is bitcoin really good for sending money back and forth?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:46
just read whats going on in different threads, they basically all agree that monero is more useful
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:42:50
doesnt it decentralize bitcoin too? and make it less safe. like will you be able to download these sidechains?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:06:33
people forget currency is to be used, and you cant use btc at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:26
like if you think abouit, BTC is on a huge pre-xmas sale. If you really believe in it, you would consier it an xmas opportunity. Either way I think it will go up, but who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:08:57
the fees tho, your better off not using btc at all. lack of liquidity will kill btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:29:13
lol it slike watching a football game. there was a 250 wall at 12500, or was it 150? how big is this one, 100?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:03:56
wouldnt it be a bridge for various currency then? like how gold is for currencies now, but digital. sort of like e-gold.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:23:42
other than you are willfully wasting alot of harddrive space for nothing. my pc atm has around 500gb of space. does the bitcoin network really rely on charitable hd users?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:42
a lotto ticket?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:39
doge will moon tho, I just know it
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:08
the transaction fees are too high
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:49:08
According what I can gather, bitcoin has high ransaction fees, especially for small transactions. It does not seem suited small private worldwide transactions, altho I think theres a market for that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:15:05
wont that mean big companies will lay claim to the functions, and, possibly be shut down by occupying forces. Imagine china invades america and decides to shut down bitcoin. Like they would the mint, wouldnt that take value out of btc
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:10:06
decentralize they say, until someone else does it =P 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:14
yeah, Im fairly new to bitcoins, and I get the feeling everyone just keeps hyping up the value, and Im curious, what is it actually good for. 
Just to hope it inflates and then cash in? If thats it, then its a like a lotto ticket right? People shouting doesnt add value, unless its just that, a lotto ticket
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:43:25
awoo [dogs barking]
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:22:52
as its going down yeah, then when it reaches the bottom, buy. it would be a perfect play, no losses, all gains
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:43:03
so its like a political statement? against banks? what if I dont really mind the service banks provide? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:04:57
there are typoes and bad grammar on their website? uh
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:10
wouldnt shorting btc been good?
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:22:37
if the goal is to make it equal, why not force a person to click a captcha, or write in a captcha phrase to get a lottery ticket for the next block? it cant get more equal than that
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:35:48
not a happy xmas for the btc enthusiast then :thinking:
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:13:51

lol, I just found 0.2 bitcoin on an old hard drive, and I thought id sell it right away, but it has taken so long to sync and get the stuff together, that btc has risen with like 2k.
now im like thinking maybe I should just not cash out

give up, the bubble burst :/
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:16:08
does segwit rely on sidechains? if it does, doesnt that mean bitcoin could be shut down, or are we supposed to host sidechains too? owned by large bitcoin investors or mining farms. It would be possible to hold the coin hostage
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:40:27
well someone out there is taking the opportunity to make money from the dips. Imagine you see it going down from 19 then 18, and you sell say half. Then some days later when it flattens out at 14, you buy again. The btc you sold will effectively have risen 4k in value.
I mean its probably safer to just hold, but not everyone thinks that

@_date: 2017-12-12 19:14:14
No it hasnt actually. And it still doesnt explain why I should pay 17.000 for one. The transaction fee in btc are bad for smaller payments, so its not really suited for that. Are you saying I should look at one of the altcoins instead?
I dont like how everyone is willing to hype up the coin without really backing it up. Its cool, funny, interesting, entertaining, like a funny thing thats also a lottery ticket. Thats what im seeing here
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:37:11
I just started with altcoins/btc 1 week ago. Ive read up on IOTA and VTC, and Ive even started mining VTC.
I think there is some fun to be had with altcoins as a gambling currency, but im not sure they are worth 17000 each. So I come to the main coin and ask, what makes people want btc up to 17000 a piece.
Atm I'm thinking maybe there is stuff happening in venezuela were not hearing about. I know they are [weighing their money]( and that [bitcoin has been increasing in popularity among venezuelans](
Maybe were seeing an entire countrys value being moved into cold storage :thinking: I guess then the question is, is it ethical to speculate in a countrys demise? Do bitcoins help them through a tough economic post-chavez phase?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:30
its kinda cool to watch i think, i only have like 0.2btc so it doesnt really matter. I think it will bounce back tho for sure, but the fees have to be fixed
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:43:18

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:36
its still falling, you should sell asap and then buy as the bottom is reached
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:17:08

how do you mean? the fees need to be lowered somehow, nobody want to pay 80bucks for a transaction
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:34:17
whats more worth a than your time anyway, its more than proof of work, its proof of time.
the chain would generate captchas when asked. Either of the of (also paid) full wallets would return a captcha, and get the result back.

Interesting, I havent heard of the lightning network before, only segwit and something increasing the block size. Ill read up on it.
Like I get the feeling everyone starts hyping bitcoin once they get in on them, but that hype isnt the same as value. Still not sure why I should have bitcoin, other than as a lottery ticket that is
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:18
thats probably what everyone should be doing
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:54
so it shouldnt have alot of transactions? that seems counterintuitive for a tool that is designed to make exchanges easy and belong to the users, or is it just a way for people to dream about being rich, much like lottery tickets do
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:59:26
good ideal, but with bitcoin tho
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:23:21
So when bitcoins work like they should, by being easy to use as money, they will show their worth, I can kinda see that, yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:33
why do I have bcash? dot they want my private key?

maybe coins arent all about drug deals? im just saying monero has a property btc does not, being useful for smaller transactions

its still up tbh
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:30:50
what is a bitcoin good for tho, does it have value in itself, or is it just a lotto ticket
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:11:53
Money isnt mostly used to trade drugs tho. Hm, but I think bitcoin will be very useful once hyperinflation hits countries, like I know venezuela is about to go under. Maybe bitcoin will be backed by not just lotto dreamers and local weed sellers, but all of Venezuela soon.
dreams+drugs+Venezuelea=17000 per coin? :thinking:
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:51:25

@_date: 2017-12-12 21:06:31
My honest questions arent an attempt at acting dumb. They are an attempt at understanding what is going on. If you read further back in my you will find I only recently started posting about bitcoin/altcoins less than a week back. Im just trying to get an actual answer to why I should be buying bitcoins, like why I should have them. The only reason I can think of is that they "might" rise in value. So to me, the comparison of a lottery ticket doesnt seem off at all.
Your saying tho, that its not about allowing people to dream of getting rich (like any lottery does), but rather to safeguard against government mismanagement. Which I guess could be true, but Im not sure people are buying bitcoin out of fear that the banks might squander their cash away. Also, bitcoin has seen its share of scandals, from mt. gox to nicehash. Im not convinced people value bitcoin at 17000 because they are worried about financial mismanagement.
If its a political tool to undermine the government, then idk if its safe to invest in bitcoin. Like that would be madness or?
And the big problem I've found with bitcoin (not value that I was hoping to see), is that it practically undermines a high quantity of small transactions by just eating them up with fees, so its not a good tool for transactions really. Which could be solved with lightning networks (that will lower fees and be instantaneous afaik) which would be a necessity if bitcoin wants to support a free flow of value not just among people, but also within larger systems.
So when I honestly study bitcoin, I find 1 problem, and 1 value.
The value is the entertainment it provides, letting people joke and dream about becoming wealthy, feeling like businessmen almost. And the problem I see, is that it undermines cash flow, by being slow and unreasonably expensive. I was reading about someone who had to pay 350bucks to send 200bucks. Sums that are minuscule at the 100k-1m range, but very very noticeable for the people that buy in, and are supposed to use it, who is bitcoin for again?
Its worth noting that perhaps one of the working aspects of bitcoin is found in drug trade, where moving money without a name registered to an account is valuable, so:
What makes bitcoin valuable (cost 17000 a piece): In part, its because it lets people dream (like a lottery ticket will), and it helps drugs change hands without too much trouble.
I dont believe freezing of equity is a plus, or having exchange fees that are so high that only large sums are worth moving. Nor do I think political dissidence makes a bitcoin worth 17000.
Like Im honestly curious; why on earth are bitcoin worth 17000. Its a lottery ticket, fueled by the drug trade?

Is it allowed to host content without knowing what it is?
Another question worth raising is: Is it your right to know exactly what calculations are being done on your computer?
Two very big questions going into this digital era. On one hand, hosting something without knowing what it is; can one be held accountable, can criminal intent be proved by doing so? 
Your pc is basically a massive calculator that runs millions of calculations. Is it your right to know what these calculations are? Do you own your own calculator? From open source, hacking to jailbreaking iphones.
Very interesting groundwork is being laid in these days.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:45:01
thats assuming ulbricht is DPR tho, right?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:05:26
the solution is to defend his anonymity then. the real DPR was hiring hitmen to protect his identity, and the snowden case proves that he deserves it.
so wether or not ulbricht is him, he should be defended, as if he was the DPR, and the presedence should be that you are allowed to have anonymity online, even if someone wants to "claim" your this or that online persona.
I think the real problem here isnt that people sold and used some drugs, but that it was starting to take a turn for the worse, with hitmen and other super criminal elements

lol bitcoins are funny
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:54:37
This isnt about copyright infringment afaik. Im fairly certain the Snowden case proves that people are allowed to privacy online, even if that is somewhat "fishy" and might involve semi-criminal activity. (some countries allow selling/use of certain narcotics).
When it goes to the extreme of death-threats and hiring hitmen, I guess something has to be done tho, and that might be just the issue here. Should the courts protect your (snowden) right to privacy online? Even if you might run the risk of becoming the next Pablo Escobar?
All of this is irrellevant if he isnt DPR tho, I havent followed the case much so I honestly dont know.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:39:31
everyone is entitled to be heard. both sides of the argument are likely to be skewed in their direction, you should realize this
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:15:53
hm, I have no idea. could DPR be several persons? like a multi-headed figure, where ulbrich was part of the organisation, like a secretary or something?
besides, doesnt the snowden case claim that you cant link an online persona to a private person?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:08:55
because DPR identity wasnt safe, right?

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:27:55
I love this response, like I said (somewhere along the way) im not following this case closely so I dont know the details.
  -&gt;
"This article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches"
Afaik know, the Snowden case was about surveillance, and how this information is invalid in the court of law. Your right about international law not being too relevant, but like I said earlier, my interest in this is how the internet is shaped for the future.
so yes, its a matter of privacy afaik. 
I bet you, DPR (whoever it may be, if not several individuals) didnt expect this project to blow up like it did.
DPR (the online persona) struck a deal with hells angels? or do you mean they used the website to get in touch with people?
I remember visiting the site on the tor networks, and I got the feeling that it was very small and very personal. Like a guy in portugal trying to sell packs of 5grams of weed, and packaging them personally to look like gifts. all without the need of a criminal network of distribution and other bad activity. 
I think courts need to recognize privacy online, or it might damage the development of humanity, you know?
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:26:13
oh thanks =)
perhaps the snowden case is relevant here too, wether or not you are anonymous online, and exactly how far this goes.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:11:50
but didnt the snowden case prove that you cant link an online persona to a real person in international courts?
like literally; your online activity is private, you cant link an online handle/nick to a real person, you cant judge someone on assumption or circumstantial evidence.
people get released based on not being read their rights. "assuming" that a 3 digit combination of letters (DPR) appearing in several documents along with an ip adress, just wont cut it, if your to respect the snowden ruling.
I dont think its right to ruin his life over this, there are no real victims, and there is no real monetary gain.
its just a symbolic ruling that might influence later hearings

its funny how you can see every comment and post as an influence to the belief or disbelief in bitcoins.
just wait till a country needs stable currency, thats when the bitcoins will shine (due to how fast you can trade them back and forth)
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:49:36
false inflation and delusional tendencies. Something has to give in the world of bitcoin. Either it solves the problems and becomes usable; lower fees, stabilizes somewhat, accepted on amazon/ebay or; it becomes the biggest fiasco in modern history.
So many people seeking to get rich without doing anything for it but lie and become delusional. Were seeing a useless item sell for 17k a piece. But the fees are too high and its too unstable to be a reliable currency.
btc endgame = stabilize or bust

Theres a casino, but alot of the players work actively to stop others from using it, or understanding how it works. Its funny how by buying and never selling, is another way to state to market the asset has infinite value.
Claiming there is a guaranteed return is a sign of a hoax also. Atleast by daytrading, you realize the asset will rise/fall from time to time.

@_date: 2019-08-21 09:12:52
it is worth what it is worth. hodlin to artificially increase the value will inevitably lead to a bubble
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:06:57
maybe not, its not like I day trade very much either. I just track a few altcoins and sell/buy from time to time. I'm just upset that people tell others to "hodl" blind, when part of the ride is selling and buying, understanding how a market works.
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:13:22
cooperate with the banks? dont destroy them
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:08:36
Bitcoin is finding use in hong kong? I can understand venezuela, but why hong kong?
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:52:01
I cant use them tho :/ They are burning a hole in my pocket and losing value as we speak
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:47:41
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:41:04
literally everyone in the space is daytrading, and your out here telling people to hodl.
like its a gamble, expect to pay for the ride only. is your lot in this space to only passively increase the value of btc? by buying blindly and holding blindly?
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:12:07
50% seems fair
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:44:26
A mix I think. The idea is to increase the BTC amount, but at the same time I believe in some of the altcoins. VTC, vertcoin, for instance has a great community. And Zelcash is interesting, for me anyway altho its a bit slow to develop. 
Atm im gambling with like 0.05 btc, moving it back and forth between the coins as they fluctuate. So far im in the plus, which makes it kinda interesting? I tried gambling more at the beginning, but I couldnt handle the pressure, and wound up losing some.
@_date: 2019-08-13 08:10:14
sell when you know its going down, buy when you know its going up. thats if your greedy anyway
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:55:41
6.15 btc is alot man. I have like what, .8?
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:21:31
how long until everything starts costing money
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:55:37
help find use cases?
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:15:00
Its only dumb to hold your bags when the value is freefalling. Theres more than enough time to buy back in before it reaches where you sold.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:15:56
I have some alternative crypto I want to offload yeah, but nobody wants them
@_date: 2019-08-11 10:34:39
those are outdated bills btw. Apparently they changed to newer ones, and the ones in the picture arent actually usable
@_date: 2019-08-03 11:19:09
sell when its going down, buy when its going up. hodlers want you to hodl the bag more than anything, and artificially increase the value
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:35:45
I've lost some hope in crypto. Where exactly is the value again
@_date: 2019-10-23 03:58:51
its the new paid2play model
@_date: 2019-10-02 04:31:34
its an honest question
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:01:57
oh cool, thanks
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:24:26
hm its impossible to use tho. I hope it becomes easier to use crypto
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:53:09
i mean its like rollercoaster, you pay for the ride. some times you win and other times you dont.
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:26:43
Im starting to lose hope in the btc community
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:09:38
these hodl people would still have you believe you just buy buy, and never sell however. The truth is, if you dont have the btc, you want it to down, its only when you have it, you want it to go up.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:58:26
couldnt the banks just invest heavily into mining rigs? if they wanted to get into btc I mean
@_date: 2019-10-16 00:21:25
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:45:09
if he wanted people to be safe tho, to not risk bad deals and overdoses, perhaps even put organized crime out of business somehow. Should that be taken into consideration?
It seems that all of these activities happen either way, even if its not seen, banning the street itself arguably even helps the organized crime, as it takes the power out of the hands of people and leaves it to the criminals.
Im pretty sure part of silk roads agenda was to let buyers gain leverage over sellers by letting them review sellers, as well as cut out criminal middlemen/smugglers that make up most of the criminal networking.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:42
tfw you realize you have .3 btc stored on an old hd =D
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:51:59
Would you convict the owner of a street, where people sold drugs? Without chance of parole? No you wouldnt
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:30:54
hm crypto should be free, there shouldnt be a KYC requirement any more than there is KYC for normal money
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:50:22
wow, i have like .4 bitcoin in a harddrive lying around, maybe its time to get i tout
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:58:29
probably not a bad idea
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:46:46
hacking might become a problem with cryptocurrency
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:57:30
I mean I dont want to get scammed
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:17:42
I had the same problem when slush pool was new actually. On both hard drives, so idk, win7? And now on win10 with a new system altogether. Samsung ssd and samsung regular hd, same issue. Both ram checks and hd checks show 0 problems.
I feel instead of crashing, the wallet should just redownload the blocks that have bad signatures.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:16:31
you need to flip it, not turn
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:51:16
for the love of god, make the core wallet stop crashing and having to reindex
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:11:58
couldnt you just ask for each blocks header? and redownload only the ones that dont match. Your block number 24519 gives a hashsum of QUwuROn, when it should beQUVuRon? well then redownload it until the checksum is correct.
And not 150gb for a faulty bit
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:30:18
its a sure thing
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:37:33
what are the odds this is a real address tho
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:36:23
idk if I want someone to hold my bitcoin for me
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:14:57
not holding something falling is the similar to holding something rising
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:19:31
Butw why do I have to reindex every time. Cant it just seek out the corrupted blocks and replace them? Its always been like this for me, across different systems
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:28:12
ive tried it on 4 different hard drives and 2 different motherboard/systems. Each time with the same problem; once it fails i have to reindex and/or redownload the entire thing again. Do they even really want full nodes running
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:32:35
if people are working, does the money exist?
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:59:49
I dont think it is, but excessive inflation could be bad too
@_date: 2019-09-08 07:05:49
thats a big rock indeed
@_date: 2015-04-16 08:24:47
cool. now you just need a country to fail and people to work for the bitcoins in order to buy food.
protip: sell food for bitcoins, or, buy food with bitcoins to prepare an international vendor, aka, order goods to be shipped internationally
@_date: 2015-04-25 11:03:06
Is it illegal of me to think a bitcoin is valuable?
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:32:54
Im at 0.2 :) I feel rich
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:53:04
is inflation really a bad thing tho
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:38:44
They decided to use a local park for illegal activities. Luckily, the guy who made it was thrown in jail.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:27:15
finish some programming things ive set out to do
@_date: 2018-12-10 06:18:16
seems about right
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:01:04
credibility, credits, trust, value.
liears, hopes of riches, schemes, anti-bank currency.
@_date: 2013-05-30 13:56:05
i love how bitcoins main selling point is anonymity, but u have to provide a picture and id for any exchange of money.
even paypal doesnt require more than a valid visa number. it doesnt even care if the name matches up
