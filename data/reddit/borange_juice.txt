its funny that people who sold at 1000 were called suckers too.

Brock Pierce because he was a mighty duck and bitcoin is like an underdog story.

Million dollars worth of bitcoin is being created everyday. There has to be a lot of new buyers to absorb that much. A lot of people who bought during the hype are now losing heart or need to pay bills and are cashing out. I can't blame them. 
Here's my view and you can call me a troll if you want. The success of Bitcoin is in its use and not in its price. This sub is full of people who own bitcoin and want to see the price rise. This type of attitude is inevetible whenever something shoots up like bitcoin did. They see a chance to get rich and jump in too late. Since things aren't continuing the way they thought it would they try to sell it. This place isn't full of honest discussion it is full of sleazy salesmanship.
Things grow when there is a reason for them to grow. There is nothing this place can do to get the world to adopt bitcoin. And the cheap attempts actually turn a lot of people off because they can smell the underlying motivation.
I think a price collapse is necessary for the success of bitcoin. More of it needs to enter circulation creating more fluidity and stability. 
Question, would you be happy if the price dropped to 10 dollars but adoption exploded?

My head literally just exploded.

Just before it goes up.

Just looking for that price that balances new supply with the adoption rate. then it will chill until one of those values changes.

Rev 13:16 And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 
17 and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name. 
18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.

Man people would get mad when you said the price could go down further. They figured you were a troll because you had a realistic outlook.

No but the government forces people to accept it as legal currency. Sort of a backing. 
[this]( is a good read

Sorry about that

I think they're all sad because they're watching bitcoin plummet.

Why don't you tip for something significant instead of meaningless comments. Cool though.

millions of private keys isn't even a drop in the ocean. Billions of billions of billions isn't even anything close to finding one. Probability is amazing.
edit: if there was any reasonable chance that this was even remotely likely then bitcoin would have no value. Its security depends on this not being able to happen.

He's not for or against, he's just looking at it honestly to try and see what it is and what people think it is. This is something everyone should do.

Heading towards zero and going down are two separate messages. Everything goes down at one point or another but nobody says heading towards zero unless they think it is really on its way out.

Bitcoin cuts costs. This is the only thing that can make bitcoin grow.

This place gets angrier as the price gets lower
