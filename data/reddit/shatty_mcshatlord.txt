Easy. Keep a set of sell orders ready to go and then modify them every few minutes or seconds and then dump according to your algo. It only takes 365/24/7 monitoring.

Welcome on the train! Grab a coat! 
LNs will offload transactions and allow scalability and speed. You won't see them all over the place immediately, but they'll appear over time. 
The benefit there is that they'll be able to offer low fees to buy coffee or a pack of gum in microtransactions. This should speed up broader adoption, and if that happens, we go to the moon a lot faster.

Minimum $50k. 
If the yearly doubling holds, and there's a double for the halvening, then $100k. 
But, my conservative side says $20k, and that seems too low as Bitcoin is pretty crazy.

There's been a good deal of quick arbitrage profit lately. I've learned a few lessons there, but not quite ready to jump into it completely without a few "trial runs" first. 
Good on you for managing to snap up those differences! A lot of people don't understand the role of traders in the economy --- traders add liquidity, and make it easier for people to get in or out. Liquid markets are far better than illiquid markets. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:13:49
No. Difficulty doesn't adjust instantly. A catastrophe could wipe out a large amount of mining power, and that would decrease the hashing power, and it would take a long time to recover from. 
However, lightning networks could help in that case. 
Nothing is fool proof. However, Bitcoin is incredibly resilient. Taking it down is impossible except for state actors, and possibly a few incredibly wealthy people on the planet who would have to squander everything they have to defeat Bitcoin. Even then, swapping out the algo could entirely defeat an attempt, but that's all into speculation and conspiracy stuff and pie in the sky whateverness.

A friend of mine created something similar to your Freewill.com site a number of years ago. He had to shut it down. I wouldn't trust any third party site with critical information like a will. 
We've seen far too many sites killed for one reason or another. 
Take Lavabit for example:
It's always a trade off with different risks. 
Right now, I think the best possible solution would be some kind of smart contract on the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. They're unlikely to go under quickly, and if properly monitored, pose less risk than a web site. 
tl;dr - you're better off ditching the web site and offering a blockchain solution.

I get what you're trying to say, but most people in the US don't have $2,000 in their bank accounts. They live hand to mouth. You really need to set a lower threshold for that. 1 BTC is pretty high. 0.1 BTC might be more realistic.

Easy. Buy more Bitcoins. The more you have, the more you'll have as it goes up! 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:28:19


Because it's a bad idea. The purpose is security. The algorithm was chosen because it's a very well understood one. Other algorithms have been shown to have flaws. 
Also, you have miners with massive investments in hardware that only does that one algorithm. If they stopped mining, Bitcoin would be useless. 
Swapping out an algorithm isn't a trivial process. It requires solid cryptographic and mathematical understanding of the algorithm, and it requires hardware to support it.

Like everyone else has pointed out, it's government regulations. KYC and AML. Those are why it's so hard. 
Keep in mind that it's now illegal in France to use cash for purchases above 1,000 euro (might be 3k - I forget exactly). There's a war on cash, and a push to destroy any remaining semblance of privacy in financial transactions. It's entirely the fault of government here. 
When you're used to the freedom of free market money, like Bitcoin, all that KYC/AML nonsense seems bizarre.

Eventually, they're going to print so much fiat shit that it's worth near nothing. They'll manage it, but the downward pattern is clear. Getting out of fiat into ANY other asset is good. Fuck, you could buy PMs and do better. And they actively manipulate that market downwards.

@_date: 2017-08-23 23:59:37
The major difference is the technological level required to use either gold or Bitcoin. So, in an end of the world apocalypse, neither will have much value, but as society built itself up again, gold would become used first. 
However, we're unlikely to have that kind of catastrophe, which makes the entire issue rather moot. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:14:56
It will increase. 
BTC trades against all major world currencies, and there is a large arbitrage market that keeps prices mostly in line with each other across all currencies. That means if the USD goes down, then BTC prices against the USD go up. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 08:33:35

@_date: 2017-08-16 04:38:45
The question then is whether or not it's possible to find an algo that can serve other purposes. I'm not sure that it can be done in an energy efficient way. My gut feeling is that it can't be done.

Technically, it's called a "Sybil attack".

Because it's secure. However, I think your point is well taken. It's a store right now, and not good for coffee or paying for groceries. A car? Sure. 
For smaller transactions, it may be better to transfer small amounts, e.g. under $1,000, to something like a Monero wallet and use Monero for daily transactions. I'd like to see Monero become more widely used, but all the KYC and AML BS out there will likely never allow that. Not sure.

Agreed. The privacy-centric coins will play a role. 


Those have an important role to play that Bitcoin can't fill. Turing completeness is a big deal. 


I'm not really sure about all of those ones. I've looked, and they seem sort of ok, but who knows? We'll see. 


I think you're right there. However, we still need to give credit to them for doing a great job of forcing innovation. I see room there for more than just Bitcoin alone. e.g. If you have places where you need instantaneous verification, such as a bus pass, then that's a pretty big deal. 
The other scene I see right now is the gaming industry. There's some good stuff going on there that's well beyond the capacity of Bitcoin or Ethereum to solve problems. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:59:32

Sure. All that is true. But, if you're just buying and holding as an investment or hedge, then whatever fits is fine. I've got a box of silver and a bunch of BTC, and for long term, I don't worry about fungibility or market cap. 
My point above was only that "Both are decentralized, mined, and good stores of value." despite some relatively unimportant differences for storing value. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:46:31

Nobody knows what will happen. 
They could both go up.
They could both go down.
Nobody knows, and anyone that says they know is full of BS.

It has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
Most countries have AML/KYC laws.
* AML: Anti-Money Laundering
* KYC: Know Your Customers
Those require exchanges and the like to ask for that information. 
As mentioned, you can use something like

It really makes it impractical to withdraw BTC regularly in small amounts, which may be the point. 
You can always convert to another currency though, as many have lower withdraw fees. 
I just write it off as one of those things. 
But, this may change when we see Lightning Networks appear.

Safe? The real question is more about "safe compared to the risk". In that case, I believe yes. 
The real question is always about risk, and not safety. Safety derives from risk. That is, risk comes before safety. Or, in other words, we're always looking at risk, and along that risk line, we set one end at lose (unsafe) and the other line at win (safe). You can imagine other metaphors that might work better for you.

Just for fun...
If the price appreciates at 0.1% daily, we'll pass $10,000 on December 5th, 2020. Other values for 10k (and 250k):
* 0.2% - 2019-03-08 (250k - 2023-08-05)
* 0.3% - 2018-08-08 (250k - 2021-07-18)
* 0.4% - 2018-04-24 (250k - 2020-07-08)
* 0.5% - 2018-02-19 (250k - 2019-11-26)
* 0.66% - 2017-12-19 (250k - 2019-04-23)
However, at 0.66%, the price would be over $1 billion per BTC by 2022-10-04. For some reason, I rather doubt that will happen. 
Still, it's fun to dream and speculate. Also,

One reason is the underlying philosophy behind the design of Bitcoin. They hate it. For many reasons. These people are control freaks, and Bitcoin puts its users in control. That must be opposed as far as they're concerned.

Back when there were only Bitcoin binaries for Ubuntu, I didn't want to be bothered to wipe a box I wasn't using to mine Bitcoins. Back when you could mine with CPU. Before Windows binaries. Dumb. Very dumb. Lazy. Stupid.

At the current rate (as per the article), it will be just over $120,000 on January 1st, 2019. We'll need a serious boost for it to accelerate. We'd need a sustained rate of 0.79% daily increase. Would be nice.

Probably mine something else. 
If you're mining with a GPU now, you're not going to see it being very profitable for a year or more. 
The issue is of "time preference". You might prefer to have less purchasing power now, and more later. 
I generally tell people to forget mining, but that's mostly because they're new to crypto and don't know enough about crypto or economics. 
I look at it this way -- if I can spend $100 to mine $50 of Bitcoins now, then I may need to wait a year or 2 in order to recover my costs, and longer to see a real profit. Then the question is about how long I want to sink an investment in for. 
Given the prices and rate of rise, it seems to me to make more sense to simply buy Bitcoins. 
However, that doesn't mean that mining another coin can't be profitable. 
Just my take on it though.
