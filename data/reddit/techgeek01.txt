This. Is. Awesome!

I tweeted over at Twitter

I would go for this, if it were possible.

This is some good reading. Leaving this here so I can get to it later.

Ponzi scheme my ass! Bitcoin is the future! As a fellow young investor (I am 17, and started with Bitcoin a few years ago), tell him says hi!
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:53:25
I remember reading that. I loved that one.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:53:13
How do I go about doing this? Am I overlooking something obvious?
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:22:31
Wrong sub. :)

Capital is the software or term in general. Lowercase is referring to it in currency form.




That last one isn't true (I wish), but these are examples.

How do I have the automatic, "put 70% of this in here, and 30% in here" thing? I'm not seeing options.
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:23:02
:). I will remember you and your son for the future. I have about $35 saved up in Bitcoin ATM, so in the near future, I may contact you again if I remember about where to send some!

For extra badassery, get a 5.25" disk. Gotta find a pink one, though. :)

This guy is awesome. And that reference to Dogecoin. :)

This. Investing is a good thing to do, and I don't want to sound greedy, but both this community, as well as are practically built on tipping. Keep the love going!

There's always a possibility. I personally think it will steadily increase over time, and when it drops next, it won't be as low, since it will have gotten more value since then, but it might.

I was there for that Mt Gox crash. That peaked at, IIRC, $1283. That was bad, but I have a feeling we'll recover fairly quickly once this crash stops.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:59:14
Thanks for that!

What I want to know, I've seen addresses to this block. How is it possible to send funds to the Genesis block? And why exactly are they lost?

As I heard this morning, people need to realize, if they panic sell now, it only crashes the market further. Besides, selling now is like getting your girlfriend pregnant and pulling out in fear after realizing it's too late. The price has crashed too low to make decent profit. If people would only realize the only way to recover is to stop panic selling, and hold out and buy, we'd be in business.
Aside from being a cryptocurrency, bitcoin is one giant social experiment. If people stop believing in it, the coin dies.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:04:40
Done. You are now at -2.

I speed solve the cube, and I can solve it in under 40 seconds, usually under 35. Shout out to all of my fellow fans!

Thanks for the giveaway!

In simple terms, mining bitcoins requires one to solve a block with hashes. These hashes are unknown, ahd have to be guessed. This is why you see different numbers advertised with miners. For example, 300 MHashes/sec is faster than 900 KHashes/sec.
When you mine, your mining tool (block erupter, GPU, CPU, etc.) mines, it tries these hashes at an attempt to solve the block, and when it is solved, coins are rewarded.

At least it's not spray painted on the side of a white van.

"Well, looks like your wallet wasn't compromised before." *evil voice* "It is now! Muahahaha"
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:23:02
It's way better to give than to receive. It'll warm your heart knowing it's going to a good cause *cough*

I saw the same thing, and the programmer within me smiled. Though that's just a loose comparative. To make sure they're exact, we really should be using === :)
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:17:29
Well, crap. Why haven't I don;t this yet?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:26:16
Not necessarily crazy, but not as typical as most, I guess. You know, not something you'd get through an exchange or online store. Food, vehicles, houses, etc.

I've heard of buying pizza with Bitcoins, but I haven't read this. Nice

" . . . make sure it ha not been compromised by Thieves and Hackers."
Oh, the irony.

Thank you. New wallpapers for me.
