lol seriously
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:44:20
Yeah I was just being a "smart ass." :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:13:03
To HODL or not to HODL....? That's a great question!
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:27:52
Hmm, interesting take.  I wonder why they value cash over BTC. Do you have any thought on why they would?  To me, BTC is much more valuable.  
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:46:50
Yeah, I don't think they were ever there...
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:39:48
Exactly.  It's just starting to get to me now I guess. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 00:57:06
Agreed.  I'm very worried that in 10 years it could all be over.  But that is only my fear talking.  Fear and the fact that 1000 people own 40 percent of the market.
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:00:02
Wow, thanks for the info!  Another question is if any withdraw creates a taxable gain or if it's fiat withdraw only?
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:24:48
Buy $10 worth but in increments of $1 so the botz don't notice..
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:52:11
Honesty is akin to vulnerability here and will not be tolerated!
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:35:53
But you'd be a kind and loving whale to us poor subjects, right?
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:00:48
The real question is, "How much is 1 BTC ACTUALLY worth?"
If the "Whales" pump the price up and down doesn't that mean the current worth of a Bitcoin is inaccurate? ...asking for a friend...
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:31:17
Aaaand that's what keeps me up at night, (nervous) lol.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:41:39
Yesterdays Discussion thread was much more entertaining.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:11:25
How do you figure when the price has finished crashing?
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:58:31
"- 55% January 2018 Bitcoin ban FUD. from $19000 to 8500."
8500 as the low?  Try 5800...
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:21:44
So what you're saying is that Bitcoin could go up to some random dollar amount greater than what it is now, or it could down to another random dollar amount lower than it is now? lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:22:07
Very true, except then it drops 2k in 36 hours.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:07:25
We need a large group stare to do any changing. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:11:56
Yah cuz fibonazi sed so!lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:45:05
Thanks for the info! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:23:29
I'm betting the whales work as a team and read all they can about the current state of affairs.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:30:24
Keep those fingers crossed.
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:22:43
I've found the best trading happens in the middle of REM sleep when you can barely open your eyes and forget to zoom out, lol.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:20:52
90% of the people I'm in contact with want nothing to do with altcoins.  When Bitcoin drops over 69% normal humans want nothing to do with it.  That's what they tell me anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:29:17
Wow, the crypto world suddenly makes so much sense now! THX!
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:23:32
I'd wager nothing under 9k.  This guy ( dropped $400mil between 7 &amp; 8k.  I doubt he or his pals will let it drop under that.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:32:53
Hans't it been dropping since 10pm pacific time last night?  And that's not counting since 2pm pacific on the 20th of Feb.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:42:19
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:30:42
Ssitting in front of your PC screen - Nothing happens.
Goes to get a glass of water - drops $500.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:57:38
Is it highly likely I'll get scammed out of BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:14:47
Well now the whales won't trade that now, cuz they know your strategy!  I think their end goal is to screw us all out of our BTC...
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:45:10
While the blockchain has value, these constant $2-3k dips are not helping the community.  It's looking like a pump n dump scheme.  I've been using BTC for years and I'm even becoming afraid lol.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:07:58
Soooooo how do WE get trading bots??!
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:17:20
I think we can come up with better optimistic principles than that! lol.  p.s. I do appreciate the (positivity) though.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:46:54
Haha, I do the same thing.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:35:50
What do I have to do and where do I have to live to be a man and where a dress without judgment? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:41:07
Did you withdraw any of your gains or are they still in holding?  Do they get taxed either way?
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:31:30
Please post this everyday for reminders!  We need to hear it. :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:32:17
You've also noticed!
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:24:30
Don't use your kid gloves on this dip.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:41:52
It held around 11k for the same amount of time.  Seems like the bots are attempting to enable stop losses, right?
