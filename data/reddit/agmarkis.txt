I mean, you had to of seen it coming. Take a look at the trends right now and look at the year graph. It is still very high compared to the majority of 2017. Also, if you had a high amount of investment, it would make sense to cash out now, wait for the price to stabilize at a lower point, then buy back in...

Well that's how I judge the market after all, the type of memes posted on Reddit on Bitcoin.

It's just a joke professor!

They know what they're talking about. I'm more of an outsider to buying/selling bitcoin, but all the crucial points on why it hasn't become bigger than what it is now are spot on. People see it as too risky, and they are not wrong. There also needs to be a reason to use it, which most people do not have.
Think about it, many would feel more confident withdrawing from a bank than from a bitcoin exchange *at the moment*

But I like the Bitcoin memes... One would be foolish to make a decision based on a meme post on @_date: 2015-07-22 16:07:24
A lot of bitcoin stories I've noticed are a bit superfluous with their stories. I want to have full support for bitcoin, but its almost like riding a constant hype train with no clear destination. Many people disregard the basics of adoption and acceptance of a service, which is why it has never caught on with mainstream use yet.
Don't get me wrong, the benefits are there, but when it comes to money, people want security (of course), and bitcoin services are questionable in many areas with not enough proven reliability.
But back on topic, I think tipping should be handled from uber to driver, and chosen by the rider. A separate tip should not be a thing in my opinion.

Dipped down to 10.3

Yeah, nothing really warranted a reversal but it won't be a smooth ride down anyway. You could still potentially profit during the decline, but it will likely level off at some point before you may want to decide to buy and HODL or wait for the next spike. Of course this depends on the risk of the reliability persisting to that point.

Personally I feel that it harms their reputation, but I could be wrong.

Tomorrow's news: Bitcoin is dead. Here are the top 5 new ways to invest in 2018.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:23:54
I'm not so sure about that. There still are a number of improvements being made in Bitcoin and other altcoins. I think there is quite some potential to improve the handling of funds to make it even easier and convenient for more people to keep their funds safe. Sure some people have probably tried to profit big time with the latest spike, but hopefully at least that brings more interest to crypto. Remember that a spike also happened 2 years ago.
Cryto currency still makes it much easier and cheaper to transfer funds to others. The only thing to worry about is volatility, which happens when there are relatively not many people using it and some big players come in at the right time.
@_date: 2018-03-21 07:01:04
I think any positive news at this point would just level off the curve more than cause an upward trend long-term, at least for a little while. There was a huge pump and spike in demand last year, but there is a lot off selling off to be done, and I don't think it's over just yet.
That's what I see when comparing to the previous spike a couple years ago. But positive news like major adoption for a major good or service could change that. It still would have to show benefit over using Fiat, of course. And a leveling off would restore faith in BTC with how volitile it has been and how vulnerable it can be to manipulation.
Of course this is all speculation as I am not an expert, but I do read and listen to some analysts in this space.
Alts are more risky but also more rewarding if you get lucky.

Problem is I don't trust samsung's software, even though I prefer their phones. Their support is horrible, apps are missing plenty of features, and I can't count on the overall security of the account. However, they sure as hell won't release something like this without being absolutely sure that the account can't be compromised outside of the typical phishing attacks. I'm thinking that the bigger risk may even be with mobile carriers if you don't set up a SIM lock PIN!
But, people will still use it because it is native to the device, even if it is unpopular in some or most markets. Adoption is a good thing, even if there are better options. Truth is, people are afraid to adopt it because of the options available because knowing their luck, they will pick the wrong one and get scammed or hacked (that's their perspective anyway).
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:32:29
It will most likely hover and limit at around 9,500 or so before going back down to 7,000 range. Unless there is another pump or unexpected news.

I laugh at those ads,then I feel sad that someone must be buying into them :(

Took me quite a while when I was trying a month ago. Just recently it went smooth and now my transfer is not in yet to invest either. I think OP and I are in the same boat at the moment.

Reddit may accept Bitcoin. I mean, I just made it up, but it's possible... right?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:16:23
This is absolutely right. It needs to be safe, secure, and easy. Along with that, people will need to understand the benefit, which will depend on merchants to feel comfortable accepting it. I think it is close to that point, but could still use a little improvement which I think will happen in time.

I would ask to get part of the money saved from using a bank's direct deposit to cover the the conversion fees

This is good news. Two things can happen with this:
1) Banks may start playing more fair and invest in similar technology to bitcoin
2) Bitcoin can start gaining popularity and effectiveness by proving that it is a viable payment option for the average person.
But on the flip-side is government influence banks have. I wouldn't be surprised if this started more regulation on bitcoin.

This is pretty obvious but subtle. Cash is not very trackable, so of course they would like a digital currency that they can track which will give them MORE control.
