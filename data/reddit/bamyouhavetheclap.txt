Which do we use co-signer 1 
Co-signer 2 
Or co signer 3 
These are the master public keys. 
There’s a QR code as well, but when we try scanning it with 2FA it says invalid

Should we sweep or export the private keys.
We exported it put it in a word document was really long 
Then pasted it into the “new” wallet like where it ask but the “next” button is grayed out

We have full access to the account we have the private keys we have master public keys and private keys we can export and sweep those keys we have access to the account. Just can’t send the bitcoin to another wallet

The old phone was not encrypted but was restored and “friend who this happened to I’m trying to help” it’s his moms phone now. What I’m thinking of trying is restoring the phone again restore from backup of his stuff so then all his stuff and files are back on original hardware and downloading 2FA again in hopes it pops up the codes

We have access to the wallet and we’re having his mom download google 2FA right now will report back

We’re looking for a solution that we don’t have to pay for just yet. If we can solve the problem without costing money obviously that’s the go to solution. As we dwindle our options then your services may become our only option. But you as well as I know that if you were in our situation and didnt have the skill set you have you would do the same thing in search for a fix before paying for a service.

this is actually my friend im just trying to help him his mom has the old phone but he restored it... can it still be done
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:59:49
I assumed and idk if you learned growing up like I did assuming makes and ass-u-me so I apologize. When you first mentioned your option is sounded like a service to me and I did not look further into it. How might we move forward with us being so foolish and naïve.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:09
we know the password, and where might i find the wallet.dat we can access the wallet just cant send any btc out because of 2FA
