Value and Worth aren't the same thing. Bitcoin has no value, but it does have worth, in the sense that someone is willing to pay 6400 dollars for a coin, doesn't mean it has a value of 6400. Just means that someone decided it was worth 6400, just like someone last week decided it was worth 5000. Next week someone will decide its worth 7k, and then in a year someone could decide its worth nothing. For the dollar to be worth nothing pretty much the entire planet would have to label it as worthless. All bitcoin needs is a month of no demand.

I wonder how many buttholes puckered up during that drop.

sounds like something someone from WSB would do.

I think its less lack of discussion and more people will use this meme to justify another fraction of a fraction of bitcoin.
It's just like the many subreddits that use posts of obvious satire to hate on things they already hate.

I mean what is it backed by? Anything? These coins were worth 5 dollars 5 years ago. Now a single coin is almost 6400 dollars. 
Why is it worth 6400 dollars when its value is fictional? Just saying "It's worth something trust us" just sounds like people are trying to convince other people to take the currency seriously so they won't have to throw themselves off a building for investing all their money into bitcoin. 
It feels like art. There is value there, but the only thing that makes it worth money is that a bunch of select people have agreed that its worth something else.
