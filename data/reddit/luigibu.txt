For such amount I will recommend and investment in another crypto. Is a good moment to buy bitcoin.. but with 15 usd.. you will need to wait long time to get 30 usd.. you have more
Chances to make a difference with small coins. Try to get something under 1 usd may be.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:15:54
That is not the point of the post anyway. Quiet sure everyone here understands 24hs average. It’s just nice to see all coins moving together.

Sorry you misunderstood, I know nothing about financial.. just saying that to make profit with bitcoin with 15 usd with the price that we have today.. good luck with that. Better to risk in any new coin that for sure are more risky but also the profits are better. I’m talking about short term trading.

Hi! I have a ledger nano s, and they add new coins of course. You can manage your wallets but... if you are planning to get the hardware wallet just for a coin that is not supported yet.. I think is pointless. You could get it later. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:53:15
Well.. I use Xapo debit card that is linked to a bitcoin wallet and fees are normal. And also let you buy bitcoin from the app. Is pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:21:56
Well.. do you trust your mates? Otherwise split. At some point you will need to pay some fee anyway. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:08:42
I got a Xapo prepaid card. I’m not totally sure that is the cheapest one in terms of fee but what is really interesting is that hold your bitcoins instead of most cards that you need to transfer bitcoins in order to fill the card with money.. but in that exact moment what is happening is that you are selling your bitcoins. Xapo lets you play until the last moment with bitcoin volatility. ��

I will wait to. If you are not in a hurry.. don’t think will be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:20:29
I don’t know much... but I think you need to transfer your coins from your legacy bitcoin wallet to the SegWit wallet if you are storing your values in wallets as Coinbase.. you need just to wait until they update, in those cases there is not much to do.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:45:56
And why not get Xapo wallet linked to visa debit card and you can spend bitcoins wherever you wants? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:01
This guy is a genius! I hear him and I feel calm. Bitcoin can dip until the beginning of times and I will feel in a bubble.. but not the bubble that people talk about... a bubble of calm, trust and confidence. Thanks Andreas! ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:42
I agree! I personally hold my savings.. but I also already started using bitcoin to do payments as well. I found xapo wallet interesting because let you keep your btc until the moment you do a payment with a debit card. So far, so good!

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:27:50
Get a xapo debit card. You can hold or spend bitcoins without paying tons on fee. I personally will not pay a coffee with it.. but more than 20usd  is a razonable fee.

@_date: 2019-03-25 14:33:26
I agree. But is not fear for new people that are already confused, that some guy with personal interests put fake ads taking advantage of the work of many others. I founding not honest and is something that should not be tolerated. Of course in this topic is not relevant maybe.. but could be much worse in many other context. Is just my opinion. Take the good part of it! :)

To point 1: I guess you could use blockchain to validate software serial numbers for example. To avoid pirate copies of it or something similar. 
Point 2: Well not sure ho is in charge of merging changes to the project, but bitcoin core is a group of developer working on it. You could clone the repository, create your branch, make some changes, commit them, push it.. and I guess that if your changes has sense, the guy in charge of the git repository could decide to implement your changes. More less something like that ��

BlueWallet is very good. Support for LN an HD Segwith.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:09:41
BlueWallet support bitcoin legacy, bitcoin segwit and  lightning network payments too. Design is simple and decent.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:20:46
No fake for me, that is most important.
@_date: 2019-10-22 09:14:32
I need that flag.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:51:12
LN : lightning network is a sort of network that work at the top of the bitcoin blockchain, making transactions faster and fee very cheap. And HD Segwith  (I really don’t know in detail) but are improvements in the block of the bitcoin blockchain to reduce space and the result you get cheaper fees. So.. chose this one to create your wallet, but read about compatibility between deferent bitcoin address before make transactions.

You can use whatever you want right now. But the scale solution proposed by bcash is just temporal and soon or later is gonna arribe in the same problem. With bitcoin the approach is different, the second layer at least seams smarter for now. I really don’t know to much. But I see bitcoin as the coin of the people and bcash as the coin of Roger Ver.
@_date: 2019-02-16 23:44:42

Coinbase is more about trading, not really a wallet.. is quiet dangerous to leave your coins in trade accounts.. better I will go for a desktop wallet or hardware wallet as ledger nano. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:21:25
You can have 5 apps. Is after the fourth the nano don’t allow you to install the fifth app... remove them all and install all again. It worked for me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:00
So.. should we just use 2015 technology as Bcash? I ❤️ bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:02:43
Well if you will put every month some savings in bitcoins.. It is a good idea to buy now.. and then pay the credit.. but of course.. just amount that you can afford if you lose. After all, no risk.. no win!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:40:35
yes! bank transfers with not commission in Europe, and the buying bitcoins is about 0.15% to 0.25% commission but.. take note about this: kraken.. is more complicated to beginners.. you don't buy straight away.. instead.. you put but orders (pretty cool at the end) that they will be executed.. when they accomplish your criteria. Another important fact is, usually kraken server get fried on big dips.. so.. i recommend.. put your orders in advanced, because.. will be pretty difficult to buy in the right moment of the dip. =)

coinbase fee are totally different of the bitcoin chain fee.
I agree coinbase is expensive.. try kraken or other alternatives. between legacy or segwit, I will go for segwit because fee are lower.. but.. this fee apply when you do a transaction between two bitcoin wallets. Coinbase fee has nothing to do here. hope helps you understand a little bit. Im not a professional to be honest. cheers
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:03:40
Why you guys... just complain? Why you waste your time to write a comment just to complain?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:40:16
In general.. Coinbase fees are big.  It is cool to pay by debit card.. but the fees are big. Kraken takes a wile.. but fees are lower. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:11:32

I use bitcoin for savings and I also use it to pay what can be paid whit it. What is wrong whit the fact I trust more bitcoin than dollars, euros or bolivars to store my savings? How do you save your money? I’m developer, so I trust more a bunch of code made for many nerds around the world... that two or three rich guys that don’t care anything else that his own benefit and have my poor savings in theirs pocket.

It could be more easy just to move the comma a few spaces to the right? After all the value of a bitcoin is a convention, we could say now that 1 Satoshi is equal to a bitcoin and that it is no? How many Satoshi are in 1 bitcoin? Is it enough now if you multiplicate it with 21 millions? Yes? Fine! No? Move the comma to the right one more time.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:01:42
Make a transaction. There is no way to export or import wallets. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:41:51
Based on my little experience I will recommend to buy. I just did the experiment, and besides I got back the investment in half of the time... Also I realize... I could much at least 4 times more just buying the coins. There is not a calculator to predict your mining profit. Price change to much and difficult as well. :)
