Coinbase and Bitpay are the 2 most important entities regarding a fork. If they both refuse to fork, the vast majority of businesses accepting Bitcoin effectively refuse the fork, getting rid of any perceived value of the "forked" coins, as they can't be spent for goods and services.
Exchanges are also very crucial, as they involve the conversion to fiat currencies of "real world value", so the largest name exchanges should have to agree to the change as well.
As for miners, if they refuse to fork then they just mine worthless blocks, and nobody cares. But they're still somewhat important in comparison, and we should make sure we have  majority consensus if possible.

@_date: 2014-06-08 15:33:39
You still need someone to relay the blocks, so even if Bitcoin was distributed randomly to existing addresses, it wouldn't accomplish this. Also, you can't verify who owns an address, so if this was the case, people would create billions of addresses and use them just to get a shot at this.
I recommend you check out proof of stake. Instead of decentralizing the coin via raw computing power, its decentralized via how much coin you have. Peercoin is an example of this.

No one can get USD out of Mtgox. Because of this people are forced to buy Bitcoin with it to get their money out, and it raises the price since there is so much demand to buy and little to sell. Don't register with Mtgox, you won't be able to get your USD out. I hear even getting BTC out is hard somehow. If it was easy to get USD/BTC out of Mtgox, then people would buy from Bitstamp and sell at Mtgox. But because it's borderline impossible to get your money out, no one takes the risk.

"Bitcoin saves lives by bringing people out of poverty"
I don't think a coin that gets manipulated by people of power(exchange operators, regulators, large holders) with extremely volatility is a good asset for those stricken by poverty to put their wealth into.

the 5% annual inflation that gradually decreases over time (will be 2.5% in 20 years and 1% in 50) will be good for Dogecoin, as it encourages people to spend. Dogecoin was designed to be thrown around a lot and spent for fun rather than hoarded. Bitcoin being deflationary will cause a stagnant economy due to people hoarding and not spending. Dogecoin will create a powerful economy due to people spending a lot of it.
What you don't realize is that Bitcoin is far more inflationary than Dogecoin will be, at least for a while. at 25 coins/block, Bitcoin is growing in supply by about 7% a year. Also increases in price make up for the 5% inflation, so i wont even be noticeable for a while.

It doesn't. At some point a new cryptocurrency will come out that does many things better than bitcoin, and it will not be released until most know about it. I have no idea what it will be called, or what it will do better, but I'm sure many improvements will be made, something significant enough to make it not "just another altcoin". It will be distributed much more evenly because miners would be more aware ahead of time, and it won't start small like Bitcoin, which had to start small due to it being a new unproved concept at the time.

Altcoins are not a bubble. Many offer significant advantages over the Bitcoin protocol such as a superior proof of work system(vertcoin) , proof of stake(Peercoin), more even distribution, lower fees(Dogecoin), and a more sustainable design.
Dogecoin solves the 7 tps issue by reducing the block reward at a much faster rate, so that miners have more incentive to include transactions for fees. Blocks being created on average once a minute also allows for more transactions in its current state. The transaction fee on Dogecoin is also currently much less than Bitcoin.
Dogecoin also solves the sustainability issue of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin will have no block reward in the distant future, mining monopolies will exist. The biggest miners will temporarily accept 0 fees to drive other miners out of the market, then raising their fees to ridiculous amounts to maintain maximum profits. ASIC technology will make it impossible for startups to get involved, as developing an ASIC is extremely expensive.
Since Dogecoin has a constant 10,000 block reward after all of the halving, miners need not charge excessive fees. There is a fair balance between fees and raw block rewards. Miners will want to include lots of transactions for fees, but will also be willing to keep the fees low as the block reward is enough to sustain them.

I think it's bad news. The money you gain as a small business owner for accepting Bitcoin is negligible, and most do it simply for the purpose of doing it. It currently free to begin accepting Bitcoin, but this would change it.
By requiring people to acquire "Bit licences", which likely would cost money to apply for, it significantly would increase the barrier of entry for small businesses to accept Bitcoin. The 2% on fees you saved by likely just a couple customers a day would likely not pay off the cost of receiving and renewing a licence. This particular regulation could severely limit the spread.

Middlecoin is horribly unprofitable relative to mining on your own. Not because of the 3% fee, but because so many people use it which crashes any coin they mine, which consequently causes the pool to become unprofitable with whatever they mine due to the coins not supporting the volume that the pool requires. The only time it's ever been profitable was when it mined Litecoin or Dogecoin since they have huge demand, which even then you'd be best off mining/trading yourself.

This is certainly true, but if Bitcoin were to fail because of something like a nonstop 51% attack(perhaps by a government afraid of it), it's possible that another one may take over if it does a lot of things better. Most existing infrastructures can easily be modified to work with another cryptocurrency.
Most of the current altcoins are just gimmicky and don't do enough to "make bitcoin obsoloete", but sometime in the future something new and significantly better might take over.
Just look throughout history. Generally the first type of a new invention is flawed in some way, but paves the path to an even greater version of it that takes over. Satoshi will have made a huge impact on this world and changed the way money works, but it's still possible that something better will come. He had no way of knowing of many of the flaws of bitcoin like ASIC dominance when it started, as it was the first of it's kind.

As far as I'm aware the system adjusts the fee based on how much activity the network is seeing. For example at off times during the night the fee may be lower, but during times of high volume(IE Bitcoin Black Friday) the fees would be much higher. Bitcoin is growing extremely fast in merchant adaptation, so it's likely that the fees will go up. Ideally this change may initially lead to lower fees, but I heard it should actually lead to higher fees. I truly fear how high they could get as more and more major companies begin accepting Bitcoin and more begin using it.

Bitcoin would also be more valuable if everyone mined on p2pool, but look at where everyone is at. If miners really did what was best for Bitcoin, then why is 40% of the hashing power at ghash, which has been known to double spend before?
Miners only mine for profit. And creating huge blocks creates a huge risk of an orphan block, which could mean losing out on 25 BTC just to attempt to get 0.01 BTC in fees.

Because millions of people pay with credit cards. There's a high demand for it. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still extremely small.
If a business doesn't accept credit card payments, they lose out on thousands of sales. TONS of consumers won't shop at a store if they have to pay with cash-a lot of people hate carrying cash, and you lose out on business.
IF you don't accept Bitcoin payments, you miss out on maybe 1 or 2 Bitcoin enthusiasts, that likely would buy from you anyways if your protect is something without a substitute that accepts Bitcoin.

I agree, but the problem is that you'll still have most pools capping their block size well below the limit in order to reduce the risk of oprhan blocks.
Until the Bitcoin block reward reaches 3.125 or lower , I guarantee that miners will limit how many transactions they put in a block. The cost of risking to lose 25 BTC to an orphan block outweights the benefit of receiving slightly more BTC from transaction fees. The only major pool I bet would raise their limit following the increase in block size cap would probably be Eligius.

Why accept Bitcoin for payments when hardly anyone uses it? It's not even worth training your employees to deal with and having to keep track of yet another payment method in both record-keeping, and website support, when it'll likely only save you an extremely low amount in fees.
0.1% of customers saving you 2-3% on fees isn't going to save you much money, compared to how much it costs to implement Bitcoin transactions through site design, employee training, record keeping,etc.
There's still plenty of reasons against it from a business perspective.

What this does make me wonder is if people using the Bitpay payroll system could get the company in trouble for minimum wage laws.

Could the company get in legal trouble since the employee is only technically getting $6 an hour+ the bitcoin?

What stops the government from buying thousands of video cards from AMD/processors from intel, and doing a 51% attack with that? What about controlling a massive botnet with computers they compromise with all of their backdoors?
I don't feel like altcoins are any more secure from a 51% attack, however many coins like like Litecoin allow for faster confirmations and hold other advantages. It's highly likely to go 30 minutes with no confirmation with Bitcoin, extremely unprobable with Litecoin, and it is less likely to find every block in a full hour with Litecoin.

Yes, but at least you can mine as a hobby and on a small scale. maybe you won't have a small scale mining operation, but it would still be reasonable to mine on a gaming computer when you're not using it. With ASICs on the other hand, they exist for the sole purpose of mining, and it is very expensive to get started with them.
@_date: 2014-03-01 19:52:08
I see your point. But even if someone designed a better gpu optimized for mining, it wouldn't be much better than regular general purpose GPUs that everyone owns, and people would still be able to mine for a fair amount even if someone else designs a better one.

No, after the reward gets to about 42 satoshi(which would be negligible even if Bitcoin was worth a lot more), it has absolutely no reward besides miner fees.
Secondly, I never said adding more units adds more value. But what it does do is prevent mining monopolies. Dogecoin will have low fees forever, Bitcoin will get stupidly high fees. I'd see Bitcoin more as a store of wealth than Dogecoin, but definitely not as a currency(this is assuming cryptocurrency actually catches on).

Do you have any idea how monetary and fiscal policy works? Because if not you're hating the federal reserve without any knowledge of how it works. It would be the rough equivalent of people who hate bitcoin or seek to ban it without knowing how the blockchain/mining/private and public key crypography/decentralization works.
Before crying "They print money, DAE hate inflation", consider why it is that way. There's a lot more to it than you think. The USD is inflationary, but it isn't as a result of literally printing money. The money supply is expanded through things such as loans and fractional reserve banking. actual printed money is primarily only done to replace damaged and outdated notes. Monetary and fiscal policy allow for short term manipulation that strengthens the economy temporarily by government control. This has its perks, but can be unstable in the long term, which is the primary reason we see recessions and depressions, as well as times of economic growth.
I do agree that money losing its value over a long period of time can be a problem.  I also agree that there are a lot of problems associated with the federal reserve that don't affect Bitcoin. But complaining about something without understanding it isn't exactly the most intelligent thing to do. I do recommend taking a macroeconomics course like said. It will likely make you appreciate Bitcoin even more. I know that after I did research, it made me appreciate Bitcoin more than before.

Bitpay occasionally encounters issues. Just look at posts on this subreddit for proof. Also, interpreting the blockchain isn't something you can just do without any form of reading up on it. You would need to read up on Bitcoin for a few hours to understand what a double spend is/how inputs/outputs work, etc.


And the negative press associated with being foolish enough to deal with a payment network that failed. Also, if you own a business with slim profit margins, one day's worth of sales can be a pretty severe loss.

Better than their being an ASIC mining monopoly once Bitcoin's block rewards get low enough. Here's what could happen:
-Bitcoin's Mining reward hits 0; miners mining for transaction fees alone
-ASIC designer/manufacturer creates extremely efficient ASIC, withholds technology for their own use
-ASIC owner gains control of majority of network due to being most efficient miner
-Continues to produce newer and better ASICs for self use.
-Temporarily accepts 0 transaction fees, to prevent anyone from competing as they would make no money.
-When all competition is gone, jack transaction fee prices up to a high amount
-If anyone wants to compete, they would need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars designing an ASIC that is even comparible to the monopoly owner's technology, only to be kicked out within a month due to a 0 tx fee campaign driving them bankrupt.
This is why we must make coins ASIC resistant. If we don't, we'll see a monopoly. If a coin uses scrypt-n, at least millions of people with good GPUs in a gaming computer could start mining to help fix the problems with a monopoly. With ASICs, you need to invest millions into developing an ASIC.

You can't make the people with hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins give them up, the issue of Distribution cant be fixed. It couldn't be prevented either, as Bitcoin started out small. ASIC centralization can't be fixed either, as an enormous amount of people would be against it due to rendering their thousands of dollars invested into such machines useless. The block confirmation time also cannot be reduced at this point.
And good luck making it a "global asset ledger" when the devs refuse to raise the block size cap above 1 MB. It barely can support the volume it sees now and already sometimes takes 2 hours or more to see a confirmation even with the miner fee.

The reason transactions are becoming "less efficient" is because they're requiring more inputs.
Back in 2010, people would spend their newly mined blocks. Because of the way it worked, there would only need to be 1 input and 2 outputs, one being the destination, and 1 being the change address.
Now, there's a lot more inputs. People have all sorts of Bitcoin from various purchases over time/faucet spam/gambling/whatever, so they have to put more together to make a purchase.
I think the solution would be for people to try and combine transactions. The fees are based on per kilobyte, so it rewards people with cheaper fees by not using too many inputs. 
To avoid using too many inputs:
-Make occasional bulk purchases of Bitcoin/withdrawals rather than frequent smaller ones
-Avoid "faucets" that provide dust that force you to put together dozens of inputs to pay for 1 thing

you can't "roll back" Bitcoin without a hard fork. A hacker would likely deposit a huge amount of coins, double spend, then withdraw before the exchange notices to double their coins.

It's a psychological thing. Sending or receiving a fraction of a Bitcoin seems unsatisfying, and it also leads to confusion by those unfamiliar with it as we're used to sending several units of a currency for regular purchases than a fraction of it. It also leads people to feel like it is too expensive to buy as they may not know it is infinitely divisible.
It also could lead to huge mistakes in the future as the price rises, as remembering how many 0's to put in would be crucial. Imagine sending 0.00157 BTC instead of 0.000157 BTC, and how much that would suck. it seems less likely to make such a mistake if it was 0.157 mBTC.

Gavin Andresen Seems to have commented on the article, assuming its not an impostor:










I see what he's saying. I don't see why we can't limit the growth to say, double every 2 years, but also use a formula to determine if an increase is even necessary, to avoid even raising the bar when it isn't needed. Doubling it every 2 years would likely have the same affect as you mentioned, assuming ISPs like Comcast, ATT, etc don't step up their game and start offering gigabit internet at an affordable price within the next 10 years.
Also I fail to see why mining cartels would try to create large blocks to force out other miners. larger blocks take longer to propagate the network, which just puts them at risk of losing their rewards to an orphaned block. I'm sure that if they create large blocks, it would likely be because they want the transaction fees/because they know relaying those transactions are needed, and not because they're filling it with spam.
Most mining is pooled anyways, and most pools already have really good hosting. By creating large blocks, you're eliminating maybe less than 0.5% of your competition that uses p2pool instead of a pool. And even then, if they can't use p2pool, they'll probably move their miners to another pool anyways. From a profitability standpoint, it's not worth it to create a large spam block to scare away competition.
Using a formula to determine if a block size increase is even needed is a lot more effective way of preventing the feared "mining cartels" than just increasing it on a timer. You can still limit it so that it doesn't grow too rapidly, but at the same time avoid raising the bar too much if it isn't even needed.

Found the answer to my question.
Certainly good news, now I'm just concerned about transactions actually making it when the amount of transactions goes up every month, and when many pools are capping their blocks at low sizes. It could end up taking days to get a confirmation if the usage of Bitcoin continues to increase.

I voted no. Bitcoin always has had rapid growth as more and more people know about it over time. So as more people hear about it, more money goes into it.
However, now nearly everyone has heard of it by now. Even my grandfather who doesn't even own a computer has heard of it(and no, I didn't tell him about Bitcoin-he found out about it somewhere). People do not like it, and it has a horrible reputation. There isn't much more room for growth when people know about it and choose not to use it.

I don't yet consider Bitcoin to be a currency, however I believe it will become one. As of now no one ever prices anything in BTC, they price it based off of whatever the USD/BTC exchange rate is. As of now I consider it both a payment method and a speculative commodity. It's use in as a means of payment is what will lead it to become a currency. As more people begin holding it and it's volatility continues to decrase, it will eventually be considered a currency with it's own value. But for now everything is priced in local currency and paid with Bitcoin, so it really can't be considered one yet.

Overstock and Tigerdirect initally reported high sales due to an initial surge by enthusiasts. However, it has begun to die down after the initial hype ended.
There's no way you would save $150,000 if only 1% of your revenue is in Bitcoin sales. 1% of $200M is $2,000,000. The 3% fees on most other payment networks about $60,000. So you save maybe $60,000 at most, assuming you even reach 1%.

There's no way it can be worth $100k in its current state. It would have to be widely adopted and used heavily on the internet and worldwide for it to have that kind of value. It would have to be in the best interest of some companies and miners to hold some of the coins that they receive, and people would have to want to be paid with Bitcoins.
Until there is a desire to hold Bitcoins, and enough acceptance and stability that they are worth holding, it will not reach $100,000.

Nothing that currently exists. None of the current altcoins offer a sufficient enough advantage over Bitcoin to replace it.
What I will say is that whatever altcoin replaces bitcoin will likely:
-Be hyped and well known before it even launches, to allow for more fair distribution instead of people earning 1000x the money they started with due to adopting early. Not just avoiding premining, but the world would know about it weeks before it launches. There was absolutely no way to avoid this with Bitcoin, as it had to prove its concept first and it was a new idea.
-Have shorter block confirmation times, for better security(probability does play a role, four 2.5 minute confirmations are more secure than one 10 minute one, and it reduces the probability of waiting too long for one)
-Have some form of proof of work(or other decentralizing concept such as proof of stake) that makes it highly resistant to 51% attacks and less of a waste of power.
-Be prepared for large scale usage, solve blockchain storage and data transfer issues ahead of time.
-Many other things that would make it significantly better than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is amazing and started this whole revolution, but there were just too many things Satoshi couldn't avoid or anticipate with it being the first of its kind. The uneven distribution of money, ASIC control, and many other aspects of it were pretty much unknown at the time of creation. He put forward an amazing framework for the concept of a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Once Bitcoin BTMs become widespread, Bitcoin's value will skyrocket. They make getting Bitcoin extremely easy- just put money into a machine and scan your wallet. As it stands now it's a huge pain to get Bitcoin, you need to trust a site like Coinbase with your banking information or buy from a complete stranger and hope they don't trick/scam/mug you.
If a BTM makes it to every major city in the US, I can easily see the value reaching $10,000. Simply seeing the machine raises interest in it, and I'm sure people will decide to try once it becomes so simple. The United States currently seems to be the fastest growing in terms of merchant adoptation, so consumer adoptation would go well with it. Countries that are buying it for a store of value/investment may also contribute to the rise in price.

Ok, I see what you mean. Cap the growth so that technology can keep up.
I think that would be a seperate calculation. The reason I did 4x is because I want the system to make sure there's plenty of room-much more block size than is needed in case there's a lot of spending in a particular week. The formula was made so that in theory the block size would be 4x what was needed the previous cycle. It's actually less than 4x, since lots of miners cap their blocks smaller than the maximum.
I think a seperate formula would be needed to limit the growth-maybe make it so it can only increase up to 20% per month, to allow time for technology and infrastructure to progress
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:29:58

They can limit the ability for banks to work with exchanges, which would make it extremely difficult for people to get Bitcoins or sell them. They can make businesses require licenses to accept Bitcoins, which could make it too expensive for it to expand.
They could easily kill it through regulation. They can regulate it, but they can't ban it. If they ban it they will still see it used for criminal use and money laundering since those that are already breaking laws won't stop using it, but it won't see much spread outside of that since no business would dare break a law just to push it.

Yes it's the problem at this point, but it could have been prevented if you simply backed up your data. If you had a backup, you could have imaged the effected systems, and restored to a point before the cryptolocker virus took over.
It's too late at this point, now you need Bitcoins to pay the ransom. However, in the future, you really should back up important files. This not only secures them against malware such as cryptolocker, but also keeps them secure should you lose your data to a natural disaster or hardware failure. On-site backups will protect you against hardware failure and cryptolocker(assuming they aren't connected to a network), but you need an off site backup to secure it against a natural disaster.

False. With each block, there is a decreased probability that all of the blocks since your transaction were controlled by the same miner. 
Assume a miner has 20% of the hashing power, and intends to double spend.
there's a 100% chance they can double spend before a block
there's a 20% chance they can double spend after 1 block
There's a 4% chance they can double spend after 2 blocks.
There's a &lt;1% chance they will succeed after 3 blocks.
With lower confirmation times, you don't need to wait as long for as many confirmations. This means you don't need to wait as long to know if a transaction is safe.
That being said, there are still disadvantages to low block times such as greater risk of unintentional forks and orphaning.
@_date: 2014-12-21 12:11:16
Fair point. I considered perhaps adding a hard cap to how large it gets, but then that would just need to be fixed in the future.
In a reply to another comment, we considered perhaps capping the growth speed so that technology and infrastructure could keep up. Do you think a limit to how fast it grows, such as 5% a month, is feasible?

The biggest flaw with scrypt or any other "ASIC resistant" proof of work coin is that it is vulnerable to botnets.

I don't like the idea of real value money in a video game. If currency in a game is easily redeemable for real money, the in game economy is often weak. That's why the Auction house in diablo III got so screwed up, due to a real money auction house. It just incentivized botters and hackers.
 I played on a Dogecoin minecraft server once, and it did not do well at all. People drained the in game faucet that gave out coins for diamonds, and pretty much everyone just hoarded and withdrew. The server died pretty fast since everyone just wanted to make money. There was little commerce between players despite their being player shops and auctions. Generally economies in MMOs tend to be highly inflationary, so that players trade a ton. When its highly deflationary, players hoard, and everything feels valueless.
Bitcoin is nice, but I don't think it would fit an online game well. Not only can it be exploited with packet spoofing or in game bugs to send the wrong amount of coins, but it isn't powerful from a design perspective. This could cause problems for the server if someone drained the hotwallet, as it would be taking actual blockchain colored coins. Hackers don't usually hack currency by changing a value on their computer-its stored on a central server. And it isn't easy to change the number directly, usually its earned through some sort of exploit like item cloning or packet spoofing.

If the price went that low, it would probably the result of a bad event that would make people think otherwise. For example, pretend the banks decide to lobby against Bitcoin, and the US Government bans it. This would likely crash it that low, and no one in the US would buy it-everyone would want to empty out their coins.

In all fairness, I'd have to agree with the CEO. The rapid increase in value attracted a lot of people hoping to get rich quick, so a lot of uninformed people sort of mindlessly believe in it, hoping it will do the same thing it did the past few years.
The community used to actually have decent conversation about the technology, now it's just people trying to get everywhere to accept Bitcoin, trying to pump the price up and encourage people to buy so that they will see the same results, and try to advocate Bitcoin as the solution to every single economic problem, even when its not relevant. It's people like the CEO describes that makes Bitcoin seem like a scam to outsiders, because they aren't able to recognize its faults and provide an unbiased view.
I see people here encouraging things like off chain transactions and "Bitcoin banks" in order to make it appeal more to the public, when such a thing completely defeats the purpose of the blockchain. It wouldn't be decentralized, it wouldn't have low fees, and it wouldn't be trustless. Too many people are trying to turn Bitcoin into a clone of our existing economic infrastructure, simply because they want to be rich off of price increases. It's rather sad.

All the coins I have are from freelance work I do online(Coinality is a great site), and from Scrypt mining back when it was profitable(hence why the gpu is dying).
I'm a first year college student that still lives with my parents, so I'm not really in a state where I'm risking more than I can afford to lose. My parents don't like me spending any money whatsoever on anything that isn't for school, so Bitcoin allows me to spend a little on entertainment such as games. If they see something like a videogame subscription on my credit card bill, they'll freak out and refuse to pay for ANYTHING(including books &amp; gas) because apparently spending $15 on entertainment is irresponsible.
Same with any of my money. If I were to wire just $20 to Coinbase to buy a few Bitcoins, they would probably freak out just as much. I can understand them hoping to stop me from becoming an impulse spender, but they aren't teaching moderation. They're just teaching me to abstain from spending at all. 
And no, we aren't in a bad financial situation.

Well if a bank gets robbed, you're insured for whatever gets stolen and not responsible. With Bitcoin, you're responsible for keeping your own money safe. If you get mugged for cash, you likely wont be carrying more than a couple hundred dollars in your wallet, and won't lose much. You can also cancel your credit card if stolen and chargeback whatever the thief uses it for.
With Bitcoin, if you get tricked or make a mistake, you can lose all of your money. Simply typing in the wrong address when transferring your money or accidentaly visiting a malicious website could mean losing all of your Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is amazing, but I feel like it needs to become easier to secure before it could become a widespread currency. In it's current state I feel like it's great for sending money online, but before I see it being used by the majority as money, something needs to be done to make it easy for people to keep their money safe. Yes I know cold storage is safe if done correctly, but it's too complicated for like 90% of people to accomplish.

I actually agree with this statement. Tons of resources are being put towards brute computing force that is needed to keep the network secure. You're performing pointless calculations with millions of Kilowatts of electricity simply to make it difficult to take control of the network. People are basically wasting resources to inflate the supply. It is economically inefficient-there's massive resources being wasted. No, you aren't "processing" transactions. You're throwing megawatts worth of computer power away just to PROVE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROCESS THE TRANSACTIONS. It's a massive competition of people proving they have computing power, throwing as much power as they would potentially be rewarded for. If Bitcoin was worth $1 million, you would see up to $3.6 BILLION Dollars worth of electricity wasted per day to attempt to claim the 25 Bitcoins per block. I fear this greatly. I understand the value of decentralization, but there are more effective methods to go about doing so.
Proof of stake is the future. And no, it doesn't make the "rich richer". All value is relative, and anyone can mint, so minting simply keeps you caught up with inflation.

The blockchain itself can handle this, so why force it to be centralized? This seems like a step back.

People who work for exchanges, governments, or anything that could have an influence on the price of Bitcoin. Do you work for the Chinese government? No problem, sell before an announcement that its being banned, buy back in low, then sell again after you clarify that is isn't a complete ban. Do you work for an exchange? No problem, fake a ddos attack and create fear to lower the price. It's like free money for those with insider knowledge or positions of power, which is illegal in the stock market.

I'm wondering how these floating transaction fees work. What determines the transaction fee? What causes it to go up or down? I've heard a lot about it, but no one has made clear what it uses to determine it. If it's meant to adjust to make up for the increase of Bitcoin's value, how would the network know on it's own? I mean relying on exchange API would cause partial centralization, so that isn't ideal. What exactly is the method used?

This is where the r word comes into play, the one that is feared highly by many here at Regulation.
People are bound to get caught double spending if Bitcoin became large enough to be used in many places. If someone goes on a spree double spending everything they buy, they're likely bound to get caught sometime. Blocks can happen anytime, and it's possible that they could happen 20 seconds after you double spend. Or maybe it takes half an hour. 
If you double spend, you would know that you would need to get the hell out of where you just shopped at. You're likely getting your food to go. But what if you get unlucky, and a block gets solved immediately after your double spend? Existing laws could be modified or new laws could be implemented to allow for law enforcement to understand Bitcoin and regulate commerce with it to avoid such things. You get the blockchain info of the transaction, maybe a security camera in the drive through gets their licence plate. Busted.
It isn't worth it to risk double spending for a trivial purchase like fast food, and any serious expensive transaction like a $2000 3d TV will likely require you to wait for 1 confirmation. The only reason double spending would be safer than counterfeiting, check fraud, or chargebacks at the present moment is simply because the law is not clear on Bitcoin, so there wouldn't be much government effort to do anything about it. I guarentee if Bitcoin continues to grow, more efforts will be made by governments to regulate it. The US Government seems fairly interested by it's potential, so they will likely worth with
Double spending would be a massive hassle, and not worth the risk as it would only work on small purchases that don't require confirmations for convenience, and require you to get away ASAP and hope you don't get caught.
In fact, it's 10x harder than simply leaving a sitdown restaurant without paying. Anyone can simply get up before paying the bill at the restaurant, and likely not get caught, yet you don't see places going out of business because of that. To get such an app someone would need to jailbreak their phone, as such an app would probably be banned by any phone provider, and risk their Bitcoin being stolen as such a shady app is likely to be malware. Few people would bother with this, and those that do would get caught.

I don't get how you could send USD in a decentralized way. Sure, you can probably trade decentralized cryptocurrencies, but how would you send USD without a service?
You can probably create one that only contains information such as who wants to buy/sell through a decentralized p2p network, but it would require either meeting up locally or some central service(such as a bank) to send across the world. You could find a way to develop proof of reserve so that those selling Bitcoin and put into a public order book could prove they have it to sell, but you can't prove that they're willing to sell it. You also can't prove that buyers actually have the USD.

Manipulating the market through pump and dump schemes is not a ponzi scheme by definition. You aren't promising anyone higher returns, you aren't advertising an investment opportunity offering higher returns using the costs of newer investors. You're simply exploiting an unregulated market in a way that benefits you at the expense of others.
This is a legitimate argument about Bitcoin how major holders can manipulate the price for their own benefit, but calling it a ponzi scheme is incorrect.

People need to learn the difference between intents and results of actions.
MTGOX had malicious intents to manipulate the price and cover their asses by spreading FUD. It did reveal an issue early on.
Bad intent, good results in this case. I suggest you all read up on utilitarianism and Kant. The question is whether or not you consider someone good based on the results of their actions, or the intents of them.
Kant believes that something is "good" if that if everyone were to do it, the world would be a better place.
If everyone shifted blame to cover themselves and tried to manipulate people to their advantage, would the world be a better place? The answer is no, so Kant would consider MTGOX bad.
Utilitarianism believes that the results of an action are to be judged. MTGOX revealed a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol. While they only did so for their own benefit, in the end it should lead to it getting fixed now rather than when Bitcoin is larger. Believers in utilitarianism would consider this good.

Not sure how much time you have to complete the project. If you have less than 2 weeks, you may want to go with Dogecoin instead since Bitcoin takes a while to get(verifying with coinbase takes a while, and it can be difficult if you're under 18). Mining Bitcoin is also next to impossible now on a regular computer.
With Dogecoin I'm sure many generous people will tip you, and it's also easy to mine, so you can probably get a couple hundred Doge you can use in a demonstration. While Dogecoin isn't as "legitimate" of a currency as Bitcoin in terms of acceptance and infrastructure behind it, it's an amazing tool for learning Cryptocurrency and can be quite fun. With a fee of only 1 Doge(~1/5 of a cent) per KB in a transaction, its much better for demonstrations than Bitcoin since Bitcoin has a 0.1 mBTC fee(~8-9 cents).
To get Bitcoins you need to either:
A: Earn them online somehow(pretty hard if you don't have significant talent in freelance work, and the pay sucks)
B: Register with Coinbase with your bank account and buy some
C: Meet a complete stranger from localbitcoins.com and hope they don't scam you/mug you.
D: Mine altcoins like Dogecoin if you have a nice AMD GPU, and trade for Bitcoin on an exchange

You should check out Vertcoin. Even if it happened to grow to be the size of Litecoin, it's highly improbable that ASICs would ever be developed for it due to its memory requirement changing algorithm. Even if someone manages to make an ASIC for it, it would be less cost efficient than a GPU, and the developers would just fork to render it worthless. Because of this, no one would dare to make and sell a scrypt-n ASIC when they could be rendered worthless instantly. Even if it was the size that Bitcoin is now, I still doubt anyone would bother to develop an ASIC for it, as it wouldn't be any more effective than GPUs, and they wouldn't be able to sell it.
is right though. Most altcoins don't even use sha-256, so forcing it to be run by that is unlikely.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:06:20
Panic sellers.
Wait for it to hit rock bottom, then buy in. People always feel like it's the "death of Bitcoin" when a minor exploit causes temporary issues, when a market gets hacked, or when an exchange has problems. Bitcoin always recovers, and comes back stronger.
Now is the best time to get cheap coins. You may want to wait a few hours though, let the trend continue and buy in before it stops.
Once the transaction malleability problem gets fixed, and mtgox resumes withdrawals, the price should correct itself a little bit. I don't think it will reach $800 right away like it was, but it should climb back up to at least $650 or $700.
Panic sellers are also the reason the market is so volatile. Believers that buy in when the price is low are what we need to help make Bitcoin more stable. If people trust Bitcoin and buy in when things look bad and when prices are low, it forms a wall for Bitcoin's value to remain steady.

Please stop trying to manipulate the market and pump. What you're posting is the rough equivalent of people who spread FUD trying to crash the price.
Bitcoin suffers from severe vulnerability to social engineering and offers little consumer protection. It has little use for someone who isn't a hardcore libertarian or cryptography enthusiast due to how easy it is to get hacked.
Until Bitcoin becomes extremely easy to use, and there becomes a way to use Bitcoin without any chance of getting hacked/tricked, Bitcoin will remain a niche network. There's no incentive to use it as a consumer instead of credit cards except for speculative reasons. 
The fees are negligible, and the risk of losing money due to volatility far outweighs what you lose in fees. Also, the Bitcoin fees will continue to rise as more people use it(look up the upcoming floating fees), so it won't support low fees if millions of people use it daily.

The vast majority of commerce using Bitcoin is currently either illegal gambling, or illegal purchases like drugs/weaponry/CP/assassins on the silk road that would not be possible without a way to anonymously send them without meeting face to face.

what client are you using? With Bitcoin_QT go to settings-&gt; options and make sure the miner fee is set to 0.0001 BTC
The miner fee is currently 0.0001 BTC, and ensures that the transaction gets confirmed quickly.
Send the exact amount in BTC that they specify, to the exact address they give you. The miner fee is automatically included when you send the transaction if you specify in the settings to do so. I'm not sure what client you're using, but in its options somewhere there should be an option to set the miner fee.

It's not just that, its the fact that it would make Google responsible for them. This means it would be very risky for them. If they get hacked and lose the Bitcoins, it would severly damage their reputation. 
This means it would be quite expensive for them to implement it, as they would need to hire professionals to ensure that their Bitcoin platform is secure and that they won't end up hacked like the dozens of exchanges and mining pools designed exclusively for Bitcoin purposes.
And having professionals doesn't even ensure its safe. You can't be sure if a rogue employee with access to the private keys of the cold storage wallet could steal them, or anything like that. Overall, its too much of a hassle for them to setup to be worth the slight benefit they would get for satisfying Bitcoin users.
Honestly, just be happy that they don't ban users for putting Bitcoin addresses in their videos/descriptions. I mean hypothetically, they could do it to encourage use of their google wallet tipping. But they give the users that freedom, which is good enough for me.

Fees are already much too high. Fees be higher relative to the block reward once it halves a couple times, but that is a long ways away and Bitcoin's usage will require far more than 1 MB/block by then.

Buy $50,000 in BTC.
That 12 TH/s of mining power will not generate even close to $50,000 worth of BTC. The difficulty is continually rising, making profitability lower every 2 weeks.
Also, a huge portion of mining equipment sellers turn out to be scams, making it even riskier. BFL, KNCminer, and countless others have ripped off their customers. A lot of them love to hold onto the devices you ordered until they're no longer profitable to mine with. Think about-if you sold devices that literally printed money, would you sell them while it would be worth more to hoard them for yourself?
If your relative buys $50,000 worth of BTC, make sure he stores it securely-that's a lot of money to most. Have him get a dedicated computer, install linux on it, and don't use the computer for anything else but Bitcoin. Encrypt the wallet, and create encrypted backups in multiple locations(don't keep all your backups in the same building-fire damage could destroy it).

not hardcoded, miners  choose to pick what their minimum TX fee is. All this change will do is change the default, which people consider the "standard". Most miners should change to this new minimum within a couple days.

Because with N-scrypt, the memory requirement changes over time. For example, let's say I develop an ASIC today. It would likely already be less efficient than a GPU since I'm competing against multibillion dollar industries with decades of experience, and I won't got good deals and partnerships for obtaining high speed RAM at a low price. The reason Litecoin ASICs become reality is because the n factor was set to such a low value that the memory needed was still cheap enough. Litecoin was never intended to stop ASICs, it was to stop GPUs- the low mem requirement was done hoping to make use of the CPU cache. VTC, on the other hand, uses a value so high that GPUs are generally the most reliable.
The ASIC I make would only work for 2 years. After that, the N factor changes on a schedule. When the n factor changes, my ASIC would become a useless brick. Because its an integrated circuit, it would no longer be functional as the task has changed. GPUs will still work, because they allow for more than 1 process to be done.
No company would make an ASIC for Vertcoin even if it were the size of Bitcoin, simply because they lose their functionality. The only way I see an ASIC that's more efficient than GPUs being created for n-Scrypt is if Vertcoin or another coin utilizing it reaches a market cap of over $500 Billion, and the mining reward is still high. Unless it grows that big, the profits from selling the devices would not exceed the cost of researching and developing a device that actually hashes more efficiently than a GPU.
The next biggest thing is that the entire communtiy behind the coin is anti-ASIC. So if an ASIC was developed, the coin would be forked to render the devices worthless. This risk alone probably scares away businesses from bothering. 
**The only way you can develop an ASIC for VTC would be if:**
You have Billions of dollars of startup capital to develop such an efficient device, and somehow prevent hundreds of employees from disclosing the development
You secretly created/ solo mined with it without sharing with the outside world(no selling the devices), and after a while people would probably figure it out somehow.
You have a way of hiding thousands of devices that consume hundreds of megawatts of power from being seen by the outside world
The world is too stupid to notice such an enormous jump in hash rate out of nowhere.

The price may not always increase and decrease as you would expect. It isn't that simple.
You might end up selling all of your coins, followed by the price pumping up from $600 to $800 after something happens. You might buy a bunch of coins in preparation to sell again, only for the price to drop to $400 if something bad happened. There's a lot of risk in daytrading. It also doesn't always follow a clear pattern, and isn't predictable.

How would you acquire a loan with Bitcoin though? Being a volatile and potentially deflationary currency, would it really work with loans? Loans are needed for startup capital for funding a new business, if you don't have the money upfront. When Bitcoin can gain significant value throughout the course of the loan, it may end up difficult to repay it. Because Bitcoin may also lose a huge portion of its value over the course of the loan, high interest rates may be needed to minimize risk. Volatility weakens the effectiveness of loans.
You can hypothetically "be your own bank" with fiat too, and store it between your mattress. You may argue its less secure than Bitcoin, but the truth is there is so much social engineering/phishing/malware/scams that you really aren't much safer using Bitcoin unless you're a tech expert that understands linux/cold storage and all of that. People would likely need banks of some sort to keep Bitcoin safe if they aren't a tech expert, and that would encounter the same exact issues as fiat.
If Bitcoin grows, physical theft becomes a new issue. People may break in and look for evidence of a wallet passphrase after stealing hardware containing it, or potentially even put people at gunpoint and demanding private keys for their cold storage.

I don't think that it would. Those with weaker devices such as mobile phones or outdated PCs might struggle to submit a strong enough proof of work, and anyone with botnet could easily use such resources to create far more than enough proof of work to flood the network.
If hashcash was implemented to be affordable enough to send a transaction on a smartphone within 5 seconds, it would not be powerful enough to stop a supercomputer or botnet from creating hundreds of transactions a second.

the government wouldn't control your money. It would be a decentralized proof of stake coin, and the government would have no control of it once it is created. The only control they would have over it would be the backing of it.
It would be backed by a static amount that people pay. So say a total of 1 trillion is paid to the government, the total premined coins are given out proportionally to what was paid, and backed proportionally to how much was given total. It would still float on its own if it becomes more valuable than USD, but it would never decrease below a specific USD rate that it is backed at.

Yeah, Bitcoin is totally sustainable when miners have no incentive to create larger blocks due to the risk of an orphan and negligible transaction fees in comparison to block rewards. Bitcoin won't be able to support more than 3 TX/s. How is this sustainable.
How is Bitcoin sustainable when in 100 years, if it still exists, it will be overrun by a monopoly that develops their own ASICs and sets tx fees to 0 whenever someone tries to compete until they go bankrupt, then drive fees up to a ridicuous amounts when they have full control. No one can compete when your mining operation has the highest end ASICs privately owned, as developing an ASIC that competes would cost millions only for you to go bankrupt when they temporarily drop tx fees netting you 0 gain.
Bitcoin will inevitably collapse sometimes in the distant future. Another altcoin will replace it.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:03:14

It won't scale up 4x a month unless it's needed. If there aren't more transactions taking place, it won't scale up at all. It scales based on how much adaptation increases. 4x a month is the MAXIMUM it can increase.
It's not a specific increase per month. It's based 100% on how big the blocks are relative to the current limit. If the average/median block size isn't increasing at all, the block size limit won't increase at all.

KNCminer owns a massive share of the mining power, and can grow significantly more. It's not much of a problem now, but if Bitcoin grows and block rewards fall, it can fall victim to monopolistic practices that aren't subject to anti-trust regulation due to it being a decentralized protocol.
For example, let's say KNCminer stops selling ASICs at a reasonable price, and just mines for themself. Let's say its 40 years alter, when Raw block rewards are low. They can cut transaction fees super low for a while to drive out all competition. Entering the ASIC market is hard, as designing one that beats the others in efficiency costs millions of dollars. They can then raise fees super high when there's no competition, and continue to abuse common monopoly tactics that are illegal in most countries.
And of course, a monopoly owner can also double spend. It's hard to support Bitcoin when if it grew too large, it could cause an economic meltdown should a 51% attack happen.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:47:58
Bitcoin is a decentralized Pyramid scheme in a sense. There's no dividend payment or intrinsic value backing the reasoning of spending $580 for one Bitcoin. The gains are only high because the amount of people buying steadily increases. Once Bitcoin stops growing, we'll see massive drops in value.

You have absolutely no proof that Bitcoin grows more valuable over time. You're simply making an assumption that it will go up in value. For all we know, it could go down in value. Bitcoin's has the POTENTIAL to go up in value, but its not guaranteed. Plenty of people had positive predictions for 2014, yet we're ending the year about 60-70% lower than what we started with.

Isn't Tigerdirect a reseller? So wouldn't they actually have to have the BFL miners in stock before they are actually sold? If this is the case I don't think BFL can scam people through Tigerdirect since they would need to actually give the supply before their items are listed. Sure, they won't be profitable ASICs, but if purchased directly through Tigerdirect I don't think they can pull the whole "mine with purchased ASICs for 6 months then ship them when they're useless" trick.

Changing the proof of work function would require a hard fork, which causes a lot of issues. Unless you specifically put in the programs code to receive the software update automatically and implement the new proof of work function, it will require one. There's no real way to automatically switch proof of work functions in a decentralized way. If you do it by voting through blocks, those with ASICs would already win and it would never change. If you do it by proof of stake, it still is dominated by those with the most money. Lastly you could receive the update from a trusted server, but the problem with this is that it would cause the currency to be centralized to the server that communicates the proof of work function, defeating the purpose of it being a cryptocurrency.

it wouldn't be a cryptocurrency if it was centralized. ANd it wouldn't be centralized if it was a cryptocurrency.
You can't have both. Either its digital and managed by servers handled by the government(which would carry a massive risk of being hacked or DDOSd), or its a cryptocurrency.
The closest you can get to a "centralized" cryptocurrency would be for the government to premine all of the coins, sell them to the public, then back the coins at a fixed rate to their own previous fiat currency based on what people bought them for.

If they have the private key, they can important it into their own wallet and use it to spend the funds.
Your "wallet" is essentially a collection of private keys. If you haven't encrypted your wallet, I recommend doing so and keeping a written copy of the passphrase somewhere safe(written on paper and locked up, not digital). When encrypting your wallet, the private keys wont be readable unless someone gets the passphrase.
If your wallet isn't encrypted, all they need to do is get your wallet.dat file and they can steal everything. If your wallet is encrypted, not only do they need to take your wallet.dat file, but they need to keylog you entering your passphrase in order to hack it.
If you plan on holding a large amount of Bitcoin, I recommend having a dedicated computer with linux installed on it, that you only use for Bitcoin(to ensure no malware).

So if someone contacts customer support with an issue on Bitcoin such as a glitched order, the company has the right to completely ignore them, since nobody within the company understands it? Do you know how much bad press this would create?
I also need to fit the "Pay with Bitcoin" and API every time I update the website design, too. 
Also, what about the liability of Bitpay failing as a company due to a double spend attack/51% attack/some form of failure on Bitcoin's end such as a fork, and being unable to provide payments to the merchant?
The risks and costs associated with accepting Bitcoin are far too great to outweigh the benefits of saving 2-3% on fees on an extremely small amount of transactions.

I'm assuming that the restriction of using outside communication services is so that they can log conversations and track what happens. That way they can prove or disprove that someone did their promised work in the case of a dispute. If people used outside services like skype/email/etc, then people could potentially forge chat logs of programs they're familiar with/fake screenshots, and it would be horribly difficult to resolve. By having only their own internal logs to compare, it helps ensure the credibility of buyers and sellers.
It sucks because their systems are likely inferior to other 3rd party communication services, but their website is never really intended to be a professional quality environment.

I've been dealing with this problem for years, didn't think my own solution would fix it &gt;_&gt; sorry guys.

Security. Everyday I see stories of people getting hacked or scammed. Bitcoin isn't idiot proof like fiat money is. You store your money in a bank, and it sits there losing value to inflation, but at least you know its safe and you don't have to worry about guarding it. Bitcoin gives people freedom over their money, but at the same time it also makes them responsible for it.
There has to be an idiot proof way to keeping Bitcoin safe, until then it won't be used by the masses in large amounts. There's definitely ways to do this, it'll just take time.

Why do you think companies put their products up for "preorder"? Because they mine with them until the shipping date, and the difficulty skyrockets by the time people get them.
Its more profitable to just mine than to sell them, so even if the competition sells first, it doesn't matter. You're still making more money.

After seeing what ASIC manufacturers have done to profit, it scares me what ISPs would do if Bitcoin grew to a size in which it would become signficant to them. It's especially scary since it would screw over people that use the internet for video streaming/gaming/other non Bitcoin related purposes.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:27:08
That's because Bitcoin is still small, and for 3 of those years it barely saw very many transactions.
In comparison, thousands of transactions are processed per second by credit cards. Let's say Bitcoin processes ~3000 transactions per second, enough for over 10 million an hour, or 2.5 million a day. we'd be looking at ~ 700 million transactions a year.
Assuming the average transaction takes 1 KB, after just 1 year of being a mainstream payment method, we'd be looking at a blockchain size increase of about 700 GB.
Also, hes more concerned about bandwidth, not data storage.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:33:57
It's always been a criticism of Bitcoin that it would lack proper development due to developers having little incentive to put time into developing improvements for no pay.
This refutes that arguement. It is in the best interest in companies for Bitcoin to see success, especially Bitcoin startups such as Bitpay. Bitpay has been the best, creating services even that operate outside of their own, such as their javascript API library.

Shit, I don't turn 18 for 2 months. Can't buy off of coinbase yet &gt;_&gt;. Now is like the perfect time to buy now that everything is so cheap.
If you aren't from china, now is an amazing time to buy, if you have money to risk. There's no reason to be panic selling if you aren't from China, or don't need the money now for something important like paying the bills. It's basically cheap coins for now.
The chinese are right in panic selling since they won't be able to legally in the future, and likely unable to spend it, but if you're anywhere else that hasn't banned it now is a great time to buy while they're being forced to dump.

The best argument against it is that it is too volatile to be used as a currency. Nobody prices items in Bitcoin, they just price it based on the current exchange rate.

Well, I meant the patients should be anonymous. The doctors shouldn't be anonymous. Their psychologists identities should be public, so that people can verify that they're certified professionals. There's no need for the employees to be anonymous.
While I love decentralization, I don't think it's something that should be decentralized. It would be best off as a company so that the employer can hold their employees accountable for how well they do their job.
Maybe allow the patients to save a log of their conversation. Or better yet, save an encrypted log on the webserver, that only the patient has the decryption key to. That way if the patient has an issue with the doctor, they can file a complaint and give the private key to management to prove the doctor did something wrong, while at the same time not giving the entire company access to everyone's logs.
For example I've know some Psychologists IRL that are absolute assholes. My brother went to one that literally did nothing but insult and verbally abuse him, rather than trying to help him. Like all he'd do is criticize him for things he does wrong, rather than give him methods to improve himself. I honestly think the guy should be fired, he's not helping anyone at all. 
So for cases like that, you can decrypt the logs and send in a complaint, and hold the guy accountable.

Yeah true, Bitcoin has slightly lower transaction fees(technically none since the transaction fee is done on the consumer's side). If I ever spent money on a Zynga game, I would definitely use Bitcoin. I feel like most of the money they make from accepting bitcoin will actually be from Bitcoin enthusiasts that wouldn't have bought anything otherwise, rather than the money they save by those that already paid with credit cards and paypal, that chose to switch to Bitcoin. I'm highly certain a lot of people are going to buy items they don't need simply because they're excited that Bitcoin is accepted.

There's a local grocery store near me called woodmans(employee owned) that refuses to accept credit cards, likely because of the high fees they have to put up with.

I'm hoping to convince the owner to implement Bitpay at his stores, but do you really think he would care to listen? It would have pretty much no transaction fees on his end and would be highly simple for customers.

Transaction fees are permanently deleted rather than given to miners. So money enters and leaves the system, ideally the transaction fees would remove money as fast as it is minted.
Honestly Peercoin isn't going to replace Bitcoin, it makes the rich richer and screws over the poor. It also puts the wealthiest in control of the currency. The more Peercoin you have the more you can mint, so you just grow wealthier and wealthier while those without much struggle to keep up with the inflation of it.

Nope, scrypt miners have been created and are gradually getting more powerful. They aren't as extreme as Bitcoin ASICs yet, but they're getting there. The memory parameter was set too low, which Vertcoin fixes by using something called adaptive scrypt n. This basically raises the memory requirements on a set schedule.

I don't know much about it, but it's decentralized and much better for the integrity of the Bitcoin network. It's probably the best choice in terms of keeping Bitcoin decentralized, but it's also apparently quite difficult to use compared to regular pools. Use P2Pool if you can, but if that's too complicated for you, using a small pool like Slush's Pool or Bitminter is much better than mining on GHASH.IO. Your profits should be roughly the same, and will average out over time.

I was about to upvote you until I read this. Forcing people to use a centralized service that requires trust, and that would require fees of their own, is not the solution. They could block transactions to whatever they please, they can charge fees, and they can track and solicit your information on purchases.
Third party services defeat the purpose of Bitcoin. It kills privacy, it kills it's security, it makes it no longer decentralized, it makes it no longer free, and it makes it require trust(what if they run away with my money or they get hacked?)
The blockchain can easily support thousands of transactions a second, it's just that eventually the average home computer without high speed internet won't be able to support it(and gigabit internet is growing anyways). Forcing people to use such services would make Bitcoin no better than the USD/Paypal/Credit Cards.
I've been a supporter of Bitcoin for a while. But if the transaction on fees on purchases reached a significant amount like $1+ with no signs of decreasing, and the devs refuse to raise the block size limit to fix it, I'll personally be selling all of my Bitcoins and moving on to another altcoin that actually is decentralized with low fees.

How is banning people from using Bitcoin through their bank accounts Anti Competitive? I think its unfair and BS, but it isn't anti competitive.
They do it for a variety of reasons:
-Avoiding regulatory uncertainty; Most banks don't want to get into trouble with the government for dealing with Bitcoin
-Avoid the potential to be liable for money laundering if someone uses illegally obtained money to buy Bitcoins they can't track.
Also, Bitcoin isn't a company, so it'll be hard to get a lawsuit going. Then again, I have no idea how Civil law works in Australia.

I understand that there are services such as Coinbase that send Bitcoin without a blockchain transaction, but I feel like this is not the ideal solution. it will certainly help, but we should not push the idea of "off-blockchain transactions", as making it the only way of moving small-medium amounts of money goes against what Bitcoin is about and created for.
If everyone had to use a centralized service to send Bitcoin without a high miner fee, it would defeat the entire purpose of Bitcoin. I understand Coinbase is currently considered to be reputable, but that could always change. It requires trust, it is not as secure, it is not decentralized, they could put in fees of their own. They could track what you buy, disclose it to a third party, prevent payments to some people, get hacked, or just about anything. It would essentially be the Paypal of Bitcoin if we weren't able to make transactions ourselves.

I honestly don't even know what can be done about this. The miners on GHASH.IO don't seen to care at all about what they do, and likely won't move at all. Hardly any Bitcoin users can contribute to a smaller pool or p2pool because cpu and gpu mining is almost worthless. When Satoshi designed Bitcoin I wonder if he ever considered if dedicated devices would be built for mining that would outperform any general purpose CPUs. Changing the Proof of Work Algorithm to something more publicly accessible such as scrypt with higher memory usage is next to impossible at this point, as few would support it due to having invested hundreds of thousands into ASICs and it would cause a massive fork far too late into the Bitcoin economy.
All we can really do is hope that GHASH.IO prevents themselves from reaching 50%. Mining is unprofitable for pretty much anyone that doesn't buy the best of ASICs, and even then there's way too many scams out there like BFL to know which manufacturers are legitimate.
Does anyone else have any ideas on how to help?
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:10:59
Bitcoin is far more vulnerable to a 51% attack than Litecoin. Bitcoin requires dedicated $10,000+ ASICs to even make a minimal impact on mining. Litecoin can be mined on an everyday desktop computer, allowing people to contribute and spread the hashes. Look at Ghash.IO with over 40% of the network hash rate, then look at Litecoin with no mining pool over 25%, and people willing to switch if the said pool gets larger.

which are negligible and make it only riskier. The more transaction fees you include, the larger the block size, which means the higher risk of an orphan due to it taking longer to send.
the 0.01 mBTC you get per kilobyte is not worth the risk of losing 25 BTC to an orphan.
In Bitcoin's current state, the only real incentive is that it helps the network be effective, which is needed for Bitcoin to have value.

Most employees get paid a set wage for their work though, not commission. Even paying them by the hour wouldn't work well enough to be reliable.
 In times with high sales(such as the holidays or seasons where your business has more demand), the company will have extra Bitcoins available due to it being a good work for gains. So now they have to hold onto them and risk their capital, or sell them.
In weeks with poor sales, the company won't receive enough Bitcoins to pay employees, due to it being a slower week, and now need to buy Bitcoins to cover it.
In order to pay employees with Bitcoin, without auto selling the Bitcoins customers use, it would require a complex mathmatical formula:
1. The company would need to record all gains and losses of every single Bitcoin transaction during the payment period. The price of the purchase in USD, and how much BTC it was.
2. They would then need to determine the average gain or loss on their Bitcoin capital for that week as a whole. Add up all net sales in usd, then figure out the net revenue in BTC. Then determine the gains or losses on the BTC considering the new market value.
3. So let's say of all Bitcoin transactions, it's value is down 10% on average, when comparing the total supposed USD revenue to the Current gains they would get by selling it all.
4. It's actually more complicated than that, as you would need to account for how much liquidity there is. Selling thousands of BTC at the end of a week will have severe downwards pressure on the price.
5. The employees would need to take a 10% cut to their paycheck for the payment cycle, as the Bitcoin holdings damaged their capital by 10%.
6. The company then sells all remaining BTC capital, in order to turn it into cash used for other expenses, profits, etc. The company buys BTC if it has to to cover full wages if they are at a loss for the week.
7. The company now has to record all of this carefully to cover taxes properly
This method is still extremely risky. It doesn't account for other expenses besides employee wages such as production costs, so there's still enormous risks. I seriously doubt we'll see anything like this. Be happy if they instantly liquidate and offer to pay BTC bought at the time of payment. yes, I know Overstock is daring enough to risk holding it, but their CEO is a Bitcoin enthusiast.
There's also serious legal issues. Let's say Bitcoin crashes 80%. Idk, maybe some other country banned it and 2 exchanges got hacked or something. If you make the employees responsible for the loss, you're now paying them less than minimum wage. Now you're violating the law if you don't take the loss yourself and pay them more.

Bitcoin isn't really well optimized for extremely small transactions, I'd recommend using an off blockchain service for small purchases like that.
I don't know if any of them exist yet, but here's how it would work. You might deposit $50 worth of BTC to a microtransaction service. This service may work with various merchants that rely on small fees, such as paying 1 cent to skip an ad or something. It would be account based and not involve the actual blockchain, and thus centralized. The service would then pay the merchants regularly upon reaching $100 or so. You wouldn't have to pay fees on these 1 cent transactions because they don't actually get sent, just recorded on a server.
This eliminates the need for transaction fees on small transactions. It doesn't have the trust that the blockchain has, but it isn't a big deal if $20 gets hacked or stolen. Ideally you wouldn't throw more than $100 or so into these services, as any transaction bigger than $5 or so would just get paid regularly through the blockchain.

Yes, that's exactly the point I'm making. I'm trying to debunk the common arguement that Bitcoin is too volatile to ever be used as a currency. Right now it may be true, but the issue should become less of a problem as time goes on.
Right now we can see it grow as a payment network, which should fuel its potential to become a currency once people realize it has the power to make purchases and its overall market cap goes up.
Right now I don't consider it to be a currency yet, just a means of exchange and a speculative investment. But investors that trust it and its effectiveness as a payment network should fuel it to eventually become less volatile and usable as a currency. Right now pretty much every price is  based on the USD exchange rate, so I don't consider it to be a currency. Most merchants sell it for USD/EUR immediately, too. But as more places like overstock start holding a portion of it's Bitcoin purchases or offering to pay employees with Bitcoin, it stabilizes and the economic cycle fills.

This is the  thing preventing me from wanting to put more money into Bitcoin/stop spending the Bitcoin I get from my freelance job. I'm afraid that if I make a mistake and get hacked/lose my wallet/backups/forget my passphrase, I'm completely screwed since it isn't insured. This is why I don't even let myself get above 1 BTC- I'm afraid I'll lose it. somehow.
If I fuck up and forget my banking password, I can just go to them and reset it. If I lose my credit card I just deactivate it/chargeback. If someone hacks into my bank account I can call the branch and get it sorted out. In other words, I'm not responsible for my own mistakes with the banking system. With Bitcoin, it's entirely on me to do things right.
If we want Bitcoin to become more than just a niche currency for enthusiasts, we'll need to find a way for its users to stay secure, in a way that is cheap, easy to use, and  doesn't get rid of the benefits Bitcoins brings forth.
Open source wallets are okay, but they still aren't idiot proof and have the potential to be misused(backups done incorrectly, passphrase forgotten, etc)

I believe you're mixing television regulations with obscenity laws. Regulations for tv that prevent vulgar language, nudity, etc, are completely different from obscenity laws.
As for obscenity laws, It has been enforced lately. It's just that now, only the most offensive of stuff actually gets enforced.(ie the guy who went to jail for obscenity for possessing offensive lolicon comic books)
Obscenity laws are basically a way for the public majority to censor what they don't like. What should be a tool to prevent offensive material from reaching minors or those that do not wish to see it is instead being used as a tool to bash those that like unsavory things. It's an idea originated with good intentions that was implemented incorrectly.  It started all because some company decided to send out graphic hardcore pornography ads in the mail, to those who didn't wish to see it. Instead of simply making laws saying that obscene content should have prior warnings/not be given to minors, we just outright banned it. And to make things worse, only the worst of stuff is considered obscene now because it either is or isn't.
Hypothetically, pornography could be banned as a result of obscenity laws, and could get people thrown in prison for watching it, but that'll never happen. Law doesn't mean much when nobody cares to enforce it. Law exists merely as a guideline and formality. You still see innocent people being incarcerated without violating any laws(ie the red scare in the 50's), and you see people getting away with stuff because no one cares to stop them.
It's illegal to carry an ice cream cone in your back pocket in some states. But I doubt anyone would care to do anything about it unless you tried to steal a horse by doing so.

Well most of us here don't have miners pointed at ghash.io. Not much we can do to alleviate the problem when:
-Buying an ASIC that actually has an even decent chance of making ROI costs over $5000(all the cheap usb ones don't do shit)
-Most ASICs turn out to be scams of some sort(deliver later than promised, run away with funds and never deliver, not functional, etc)
-the best ASICs that actually make money are used by the manufacturers until selling them is more profitable.
-Mining on a GPU not only loses you money, but has a negligible effect on securing the network.

I wouldn't call it deflationary when there's currently a higher annual increase in money supply than US dollar- we're looking at about a 6-7% increase in coins per year. We're also looking at a 50% decline in value since Bitcoin's peak 7 months ago.

There's currently no automatic Dogecoin-&gt;USD services out there like Bitpay or Coinbase, and Dogecoin is extremely Volatile(goes up or down 400% in one day all the time)

@_date: 2014-02-24 19:20:24


This doesn't seem like a reliable business model at all. How could they take so much risk by protecting them against losses due to volatility, yet run a full reserve? Where are the profits to be made? It sounds almost like a gamble based on Bitcoin's success, and if Bitcoin tanks, they won't be financially capable of covering everyone's losses.


What happens if someone's 'bee card' gets stolen? Since there's no chargebacks, couldn't they lose all of their money? Sounds like a Bitcoin debit card, except worse.
Glad I decided not to buy stock in them, such a plan does not seem plausible at all, and they could easily collapse if Bitcoin loses its value. It certainly promises a lot, but there's no guarentee it will succeed.

But gold actually has intrinsic value, such as its high conductivity and other physical aspects of it. Owning Bitcoin just means you have access to make a change to data in an established peer2peer network.

Proof of stake results in less waste of electricity, however it can be risky if anyone owns more than 50% of the coins.
Bitcoin will probably never fork to it because it would be far too controversial. The people with ASICs would refuse to make a change that renders their money making machines worthless, so the blockchain would split in two and the industry behind it would crumble. Unless pretty much every important name in the industry such Bitpay, coinbase, all the major exchanges, and blockchain all agreed to the change, a fork would not go well.
There are other altcoins that use proof of stake, however I can't mention them due to the subreddit rules.

@_date: 2014-01-29 21:50:26
The issue I see with Bitcoin is that you're slightly less likely to relay a block in time if you include more transactions. That leads pools such as this one to cap the size at ridiculously small amounts like 48 KB.
Transactions fees are currently negligible compared to block size and will continue to be until it's halved a couple more times, so its in the best interest of miners to avoid wasting time processing transactions and to instead just get the block out ASAP before someone else does in fear of ophaning.
Not really sure how this can be solved.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:08:02
The article doesn't provide any proof that Mtgox is insolvent, it just assumes so.

it hardly functions a one though. People only traded their USD for Bitcoin because they desperately needed to get their funds out of there, so it naturally raised the price on there artificially.
People are now desperately selling their Bitcoins to get their funds out of there, so it is decreasing the value artificially as well. It's hardly an exchange when they manipulate the prices much through their own internal decisions, an active and working exchange like Bitstamp would provide a far more reasonable value. Bitpay and Coinbase's rates lie roughly around Bitstamp's value, so Bitstamp/BTC-e provide a good indicator of the purchasing power of Bitcoin.

Botnets wouldn't make that big of a difference. Most computers that get affected by botnets are generally older people not really aware of computer security, and those computers tend not to have video cards and use lower end processors. So the amount of power you could get from a botnet would barely matter. Yes, it would be profitable for the operator, since hes not paying for electricity, but it wouldn't pose a threat to the network security. A huge botnet that infected millions of computers would likely not even control more than 1-2% of the network since most computers would only hash at &lt;1 KH/s.

Dogecoin and Litecoin each have about 100 GH/s total hashrate.
Let's say I took over 10 million computers(few botnets are this large), each hashing at an average of 1 KH/s.
I would have 10 GH/s total, less than 10% of the network. I'd be raking in a lot of money, but I wouldn't be able to double spend well or anything like that.
Also, if a crytpocurrency as large as Bitcoin used scrypt-n, it would likely have a hashrate much higher than 100 GH/s.

It's a lot easier for him to hide and remain uncaught when using Bitcoin. Anyone can easily open up Tor to hide their IP, then go on a forum and promise massive returns, followed by running a Ponzi scheme. They could then tumble their coins, maybe trade to a few altcoins and back, and slowly cash out as needed.
If someone attempted it with cash/fiat, there would be a known physical identity behind the individual, making it a lot more difficult.
@_date: 2014-07-13 05:38:46
No, it can't. The max block size is 1 MB, which only supports about 7 transactions per second. Even if it was raised, miners would still cap their blocks small as the transaction fees are negligible compared to block rewards.
IMO people will end up using altcoins like Dogecoin for transactions, but Bitcoins to store value. Bitcoins are like gold, and with the rapidly rising fees in 0.10 should adoption increase, it won't support being a payment network.

Hey, I didn't say it would never happen. I just said it wouldn't happen at this time. Bitcoin will continue to grow, and eventually they will start accepting Bitcoin. Once it becomes large enough, they will inevitably have to accept it to beat their competition and meet customer demands. It just takes time. Right now we just need to make Bitcoin appeal more to consumers, and Merchants will definitely accept it. 
Credit cards are only accepted because of massive demand from consumers. Merchants HATE paying the 3-4% fees on all their transactions, but they're forced to accept it because refusing to means losing sales. Consumers love using it because of their rewards. If Bitcoin were to compete with credit cards in terms of usage, retailers would definitely accept it through Bitpay/Coinbase since it saves them money compared to credit cards. As of now though, the demand is not great enough.

Regulation of Bitcoin as a whole is outside of the capabilities of the Federal Reserve. IE they can't ban it altogether-Bitcoin operates on its own outside of the banking system.
They however are pro regulation in what is pertinent to them. For example, if Bitcoin adaptation grows, they may be able to regulate banks working with Bitcoin. For example they may establish regulations on them such as how they handle the control the storage of Bitcoin(so we don't see MTGox 2.0).
They seem more interested in protecting consumers from the problems that have occured with Bitcoin. A lot of us fear the word "regulation", but this may be somewhat of a good kind if done right. Government regulation of Bitcoin exchanges and banks could perhaps make them more reliable(unless you really distrust the government). 
At this point, the only "bad" regulation I can see us getting in the US are things that infringe our privacy when exchanging Cryptocurrency(such as banning use of tumblers and requiring exchanges to provide all customer info to the government/stores report their transactions).

Bitcoin is easy to use, the problem is that it isn't easy to use properly. Anyone can set up a coinbase account and buy bitcoin relatively easy, however it can be a bit confusing for some people to figure out how to secure their money and set up encrypted backups and such. 2 or 3 years from now I could see it being used a ton over the internet much like email, but I don't see the average person storing more than $2000 or so in it, except those with faith in it or speculating further growth.
I feel like Bitcoin can be used by anyone casually for online purchases, such as Zynga games, but it will take some advancements that make it easier to secure your Bitcoins before people use it to store large amounts of money.

Miners will mine for transaction fees after the Bitcoin bounty ends. There will still be an incentive to mine. The total value of transaction fees is likely to rise as Bitcoin is more adopted, simply because funds will be transfered more once it is used for actual commerce rather than speculation. For example there might be 0.1BTC in fees per block on average now(guessing), but since more transactions will take place, more fees will  occur. While the fees will likely be adjusted to remain relatively low(such as 5-10 cents), more will take place.

Because with Bitcoin you need to be a tech nerd that doesn't fall victim to phishing, malware, or social engineering in order to keep your money safe. Banks are idiot proof. Bitcoin isn't. I reckon most people don't know how to build their own computer, uninstall and run Linux, compile their own Bitcoin client from source code that they personally reviewed and confirmed to be safe, and encrypt their files.
I like Bitcoin, but honestly in its current state it isn't  for everyone. There will always be scams trying to take advantage of fools. Social engineering is powerful, and people will always fall for scams that end up causing them to give away their private keys. Most people in the US aren't experts with computers.
edit: Yes I know you don't need to be that tech saavy to use Bitcoin. But if you're dealing with life savings that you need to keep safe, as OP suggests it be a alternative to banks, then yes you really need to know all that, otherwise you're taking a large risk.

Oh please stop circlejerking. It grows at about 5% per year. And that number will steadily decrease in percentage. 5% is not "hyperinflation". Many economists believe a 3% rate of inflation is actually healthy for an economy because it encourages spending instead of a stagnant market. Dogecoin is just slightly above that. Bitcoin currently grows at about 6% supply per year. The only difference is that it eventually will stop being inflationary, and then it will collapse when ASIC miners monopolize it after mining loses its raw rewards-you'll likely see transaction fees costing several dollars since there will be no competition. If someone tries to develop a better asic and compete, they'll just set fees to 0 for a few weeks and drive the competition bankrupt. And good luck competing without millions to develop a better ASIC.

It shouldn't get much worse. Think of Bitcoin like dollar notes or coins, except each bill or coin can only be ripped into smaller bills/coins, or combined together to make the target.
**Example:** 
You receive 0.05 BTC
You receive 0.10 BTC
You then purchase something for 0.14 BTC.
Your wallet will take the 0.10 BTC, and the 0.05 BTC to make a transaction. These are inputs.
The wallet will then take the 0.05 btc transaction, and split it up into 0.04 BTC, and 0.01 BTC.  The 0.01 BTC is your change, and it sends it back to a change address of yours. The seller receives your 0.10 BTC, and your 0.04 BTC.
In summary:
The 0.10 you received
The 0.05 you received
0.14(to the seller, its what they get)
0.01(back to you as change)
**Now, imagine a scenario where you have tons of small transactions:**
you receive 0.0001
You receive that same payment in 200 separate transactions, every single day from a faucet over the course of 200 days.
You then purchase something for 0.015 BTC.
It then has to take 150 inputs to make up the 0.15 BTC you want to send. It's like going to the store, and trying to pay with pennies- it'll upset the cashier and everyone around you. 150 inputs takes up a ton of space compared to 2, and you'll likely get higher fees as a result.
Think of a transaction like someone writing you a check, but instead of depositing the check, you use that check to pay someone else, and you can rip it up into smaller pieces or combine it with others to fit the amount you need. You pay with the previous transactions you receive split up and combined.

What's the point in using Bitcoin if I have to trust a third party that can gather information on my purchase/disclose with others, could potentially scam me, could get hacked, could charge excessive transaction fees, could block transactions, or lose my money due to a mistake on their end?
Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized and not require trust. Forcing people to use off chain transactions to avoid massive fees gets rid of everything Bitcoin stands for. The moment the devs announce that they support off chain transactions is the moment I dump all my coins for Litecoin.
Off chain transactions completely defeat the purpose of Bitcoin. They require trust, are centralized, and turn Bitcoin into nothing better.

This is true, but there's really 2 kinds of people that disapprove of Bitcoin. There's those that understand it, but do not believe it will succeed or go anywhere because of various reasons like it being too volatile or not being backed. Explaining Bitcoin won't convince these people at this time, and would be the rough equivalent of preaching just like you described.
Then you have the people who don't understand it. These people are likely to get involved with Bitcoin if you clear up what they've already heard about it from the media and other sources. These are the people I was referring to in my post, the people we need to talk to the most.
There's 5 types of people:
Those who use Bitcoin
Those who want to use Bitcoin, but are too overwhelmed with it
Those that have never heard of Bitcoin
Those that disapprove of Bitcoin because they don't trust it
Those that have a false understanding of it

I do suppose you're right, I think you can send small amounts to a lot of people if it adds up over the limit. So hypothetically they could send out thousands of their 1 cent transactions at once-the miner fee would still be high though.

I'd say   and  are the largest problems for most in the US. The cost of training employees to handle Bitcoin sales would likely exceed the profit made from 1 or 2 additional customers a month that choose to pay with Bitcoin. There's also the additional need to track yet another payment method. If you're accepting Bitcoin as a small business nowadays, its likely because you are a believer in the technology.
  and  are handled by companies like Bitpay, so there's little need to be concerned about that if you just convert to fiat.

Yeah, it took me a while to come up with that title. At first it was something like "Bitcoin is a race between governments and consumer adaptation." After I got further into typing the post, I realized that it is not adaptation alone that is important, but simply knowledge about it. People do not need to use Bitcoin to support it. 
I'm perfectly fine that some people are too afraid to start because of it's volatility/risk and how small it currently is. I'd rather someone know as much as possible about it and not use it because lack of trust in it than avoid it and ridicule it because of not understanding how it works. As Bitcoin grows and shows it's true potential, those that were first in doubt will likely consider it. Those that do not understand the technology are unlikely to change unless someone explains it to them.
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:15:58
I don't mind people having the option to use payment processors. If someone wants to use coinbase, that is fine with me-in fact its good for Bitcoin for people to have the more simple OPTION.
What I don't want is for transaction fees on the blockchain to become ridiculous like $5, to the point where we have to use Coinbase for everything if we don't want to pay immense fees. Right now the developers seem to want to keep the block size limit at 1 MB while continually raising the transaction fees with the new system until it stops being used except for major transfers like exchanges moving funds. They support forcing everyone to make transactions off of the blockchain. That's why I personally will be moving to Litecoin or another altcoin if this doesn't change.

You know why it had such high returns? Because people were willing to buy in. You're using past results as reasons for present decisions. Bitcoin can't go up in value forever, once everybody buys in there's no one else to pump it up. It's almost like a decentralized pyramid scheme. It WAS A good investment for people that got in extra early, at the expense of those that got in late. Is it now? We won't know until the future. All we know is that it is VERY high risk, and there is the potential of losing a massive portion of your money in the event of a flash crash. That's like telling me that investing in tech stocks in the height of 2001 bubble is an AMAZING idea because you saw amazing gains from it.
 Let's also know that there are many insiders capable of manipulating the price to their advantage, such as exchange owners and those in charge of regulation. MTGox did some extremely obvious insider trading before the site went down, as you can see massive changes in price just minutes before a major announcement. Let's not forget that government officals can do the same. Bitcoin is a highly risky investment that can either see amazing returns, or horrible loss.
Bitcoin has a lot of nice technology and potential to improve payments online, but idiots like you that like it simply because it made you rich are what ruin it.

Except there's fees on pretty much every Bitcoin transaction if you want it to go through in a reasonable amount of time, and those fees are likely going to become greater once the Bitcoin network sees more traffic with the new floating transaction fees system.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:32:24
This is not true at all, I don't know where you heard this. The only reason blocks are capped at 1 MB is because in the past it was never needed to be any higher, and it prevents spam. For example, if the max block size was 10 TB right now, it would be bad because someone could find a block and fill it with pointless transactions in order to make the blockchain too large to store.
The 1 MB limit is outdated, and needs to be raised. With a limit of 1 MB Bitcoin can barely handle 7 transactions per second. If Bitcoin grew any more than its current state, it would have to handle 2000+ transactions per second.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:23:59
Bitcoin already has enough attention. Almost everyone has heard about Bitcoin by now, it's just that most people have no idea how it works. At this point, people just know its some kind of internet money. They don't know about decentralization, private/public keys, etc. Most news of Bitcoin is either about the price, or about its criminal use.
IMO the news of seized Bitcoins being auctioned won't cause us to go to the moon. It will just reinforce the negative stigma Bitcoin has. IMO Bitcoin can't grow much more until people realize its advantages. Right now we're past the phase where people realize "it exists". Now we need to clean up the negative association people have with it, and prove its usefulness. Merchants accepting it and infrastructure being built is part of this.

No, I wouldn't. If mining was primarily controlled by a few major organizations, we could see price fixing and ridiculously high fees once the block rewards get low. Since Bitcoin is unregulated, there's nothing stopping mining cartels or price fixing.

Unpopular opinion right here.
If it happened now, people would mostly flock to physical assets of value; life necessities such as food/shelter, and perhaps valuable metals. I don't think people would go to cryptocurrencies like everyone suggests, as they are not yet commonly accepted or usable for everything. They also lack intrinsic value. Paying for the services needed to use Bitcoin such as electricity and internet also makes it hard to afford to hold it if the country was in economic ruin.
Few know about Bitcoin, so I doubt a lot of people flock to it. In fact, I think the value may even drop, as people end up desperate to liquidate their Bitcoin investments in order to survive and cover the necessities of life.
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:40:15
The fee is needed because without one, people that want to destroy Bitcoin could flood the network with small transactions back and forth, causing the blockchain to grow much to large and come to a standstill. Transaction fees make it very expensive to do this.

Nearly every cryptocurrency falls when Bitcoin falls, as their value is usually proportional. I would not say Litecoins are more stable. Also keep in mind, this subreddit tends to hate any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin, even if they have advantages over it.

There's not enough of a market to make scrypt-n coins worth buying new GPUs for. With 200 GH/s of scrypt GPU miners(~100 GH/s of Scrypt N), ready to migrate to Vertcoin once scrypt ASICs dominate, it likely wont even be profitable to mine even with existing hardware.

It's not just about how much time it takes to set it up, but about how much Liability and upkeep it requires. Sure, if you're a small business owner, it takes a couple hours to set it up. But with a larger corporation, it can take a lot longer to communicate how you want it implemented. Design takes communication, and when updating a website, PoS service, or anything else, it would be necessary to maintain Bitcoin support.
It's also even more expensive to train employees. If they do not know how Bitcoin works, then the customer experience would be unsatisfactory. If I contact support, and link to my transaction on blockchain.info proving I paid and did not receive my order, they might not believe me.
On the other hand, if I double spend, and Bitpay catches it before the order processes, I may be able to trick them into giving me the order anyways. Or maybe I come up with some BS information about Bitcoin to manipulate them into thinking I paid when I didn't. And training each employee takes away from time spent working.
There's also the risk that Bitcoin suffers from a 51% attack at some point, or some form of double spending attack, and Bitpay goes under. With no fees, and 0-confirmation transaction support with Bitpay taking the liability, it seems like they will have money issues in the future. It's an extremely risky business model. I also said Neo &amp; bees business model was unsustainable and too risky, and look what happened.
Point being, there's a lot of work it takes to support Bitcoin in a company infrastructure, for little reward.

-Currently, the majority of miner income is earned from raw block rewards. TX fees are negligible in comparison
-Miners will cap their block sizes just like they currently do, and simply keep the min fee at 0.1 mBTC, not including txs with the new fee
-People paying transactions will simply have to wait until a pool accepting the new 0.01 mBTC fee would include their transaction
-As a result of this change, some miners will implement the minimum 0.01 mBTC fee. If enough follow this standard, the fee could be considered changed.
-The min fee is not hard coded, it is simply a default and considered a standard. Right now most pools only include transactions that follow the 0.1mBTC/kb rule, with a few accepting 0 fee transactions in their blocks.

The attacker would earn a lot more than 41 LTC a day with the same processors. Not sure how the heck you got that number.
assuming 20 kh/s from those same processors(scrypt seems to be about 500-1000x slower), thats 20 GH/s total in scrypt mining rates. It takes about 4 MH/s to make 1 litecoin a day at the current difficulty. That turns out to be about 5000 LTC a day, which is worth about $100,000-$120,000 a day.
Now he won't be able to get it into fiat currency, as even with mixing services he'd have absolutely no way to explain to feds how he magically obtained 100 BTC a day(assuming he trades to BTC-E, mixes, then trades to a more reputable bitcoin exchange).

No, it doesn't process transactions. All it does is decide who has the right to process transactions. Tired of people saying "Oh its worth spending millions of $ worth of electricity daily because its processing transactions", when in reality the network would support the same amount of transactions whether the network is at 2 GH/s or 100 PH/s.
All you're doing is backing the security of the network with raw computational power. it's absolutely necessary to have lots of people mining to make a 51% attack too expensive to achieve. All of this electricity spent mining is simply the cost of achieving a decentralized cryptocurrency. There are other methods such as proof of stake, but all of them have their own flaws.

Freemium games aren't bad, they're just bad when they get over monetized like with Zynga games. For example, Dota 2, a valve game, is entirely free to play, and you get access to all the content and playable characters for free. The only thing that costs money is costumes that do absolutely nothing but look cool, and you can even earn them in game.
I don't hate f2p games, I just hate the ones that make you feel like you have to spend money and constantly remind you of spending money.

Any currency has the potential be universal, it's just a matter of growth. The USD is beginning to be used a lot in third world countries due to their own fiat currency being unstable, such as in Zimbabwe. The Euro is used throughout much of Europe.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin has the potential to become a universal currency, but its not like other currencies don't. Bitcoin is supposed to be good due to its other features that do not exist on centralized platforms.

If the block size limit was raised to 500 MB, and miners raised their limit, it easily could support thousands of transactions per second.
It would make it difficult for those with uber slow internet to run a full node, and eventually impossible to store on the average home computer hard drive, but plenty of businesses/mining pools would be able to store the blockchain.

You should offer a discount for people that pay with Bitcoin, to encourage them to use it and save on fees. Even if it's just 1%.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:39:59
Roughly the same, but as a merchant you want to make payments as easy as possible for the consumer so that your store appeals to them. For example, my parents are extremely hesistant to shop anywhere that doesn't take credit cards.
We're supporting shopping anywhere that accepts Bitcoin, just as Paypal users may want to shop at places that take Paypal.

Not when the mining fad dies off the moment people realize that the only people profiting are those that sell the ASICs.
Plus everybody just mines on GHash.IO, and all everyone else can do is bitch and whine until the miners switch since most ASICs are scams, cost thousands of dollars, and don't even earn a profit.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:01:08
The problem with controlling 50%+ of mining power is that you create centralization, a single point of failure. Even if the operator of Ghash.IO had good intents, and never double spent(Note: Ghash.IO has double spent before against gambling sites), the pool getting hacked by someone with bad intents could cause problems. There's tons of money to be made by double spending(can basically double/triple your coins every 6 blocks by depositing to an online wallet/exchange/gambling site), so hackers will target it.
I personally would mine if 80% of ASIC sellers weren't complete scammers like BFL, if the devices weren't held/used by manufacturers until they're more profitable to sell than mine on, and if the only profitable devices weren't over $10,000 USD.
ASIC mining makes mining centralized-the manufacturers of ASICs have far too much control. I wouldn't be surprised if most of the hashing power on Ghash.IO is from manufactuers. That's why I prefer ASIC resistant coins like Vertcoin, because anyone can pick up a $200 GPU and actually make a difference and secure the network.

Not true. Because Dogecoin has a a continuous 10,000 block reward, it will survive indefinitely, unlike Bitcoin which will die sometime in the next 50-100 years if not for some other reason. Bitcoin will die when the block reward becomes too low to prevent mining monpolies. The fast reduction of block rewards also reduces inflation, and encourages miners to include more transactions due to fees being significant enough relevant to raw block rewards.
When Bitcoin's block reward falls too low, we will see common monopoly tactics. Massive ASIC farms like the ones KNCminer has will dictate the fees. They can set them as high as they want, and no one will be able to compete at all. If someone attempts to compete, they can temporarily reduce their fees to 0, to prevent anyone else from profiting at all, forcing them bankrupt. With the high entry costs of developing a competitive ASIC, its impossible to enter the market and survive unless you're the wealthiest.
Dogecoin is immune to this, because the 10,000 block reward subsidizes miners. Even if someone attempts to start mining and accepting 0 fee transactions, they can not force others out of it. They will still earn from the 10,000.

If someone gets access to your Bitcoin wallet, you lose all of your money with no way of getting it back.
If someone gets access your bank account, you can dispute it and freeze the account. Large transfers generally take several days to complete, and they'll call you if it seems abnormal(IE you're transferring thousands of dollars to somewhere you never sent to before).

by default the block size is capped at 350 KB. Most pools change this manually to be either higher or lower. This only changes the default, which does next to nothing.

Most people don't hear much about Bitcoin except the sensationalist stories on the news about how it is used for drug sales, money laundering, and child porn. So when they first hear about Bitcoin, they immediately facilitate it with criminal activity. They likely do not know it is used for all kinds of ecommerce like Overstock and Tigerdirect. Naturally, most people want would to ban something that is used frequently for criminal activity, especially if they aren't aware that it is primarily used for legitimate purposes.
If they asked "should federal regulators ban Dogecoin", I guarantee you that the majority would say "no" or "not sure". Since Dogecoin has a more positive tone to it, people are less against it. Even though it is the exact same technology which could be used for the exact same purposes, simply the tone behind it severly influences people's decisions. The press behind Dogecoin has generally been positive such as stories of the community getting together and donating, whereas the press behind Bitcoin has been sensationalist stories of its criminal use and accusations of it being a scam of some sort such as a Ponzi scheme.

I have a plan. I designed how the technology would work, its not really "just an idea". I guess I just used the wrong terminology. 
Without going into too much detail, I basically designed how the software and hardware would operate from a technical standpoint.
What remains is actually typing out the code to get it to work, and creating a physical hardware blueprint besides just explaining what it needs.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:03:56
Maintaining proper security and backups isn't cheap though, imagine dropping your phone and losing your savings. Having to spend more money to develop backups wouldn't be ideal.
Also, there's always the risk of physical theft. Imagine being mugged and forced to give out your wallet passphrase at gunpoint. Dedicated hardware wallets are likely needed if Bitcoin grew significant, which likely would not be cheap enough for the poor.

Not really, if 1 Bitcoin happened to become worth as high as $1 million, 1 uBTC would be $1. And for a Bitcoin to be worth $1 million, it would pretty much need to see mainstream usage all across the world. We're used to seeing 2 decimals, so satoshi would be like cents. Even at $5 million a piece (which is entirely unrealistic, as it almost exceeds the global wealth value), 1 satoshi would be 5 cents, and people always complain about how pennies still exist anyways.

Bitcoin relies far too heavily on technology that can fail. Let's say the internet gets cut. How would Bitcoin work then? fiat currency on the other hand can continue to operate in the event of technology failing. When we trust the power of it into  2 or 3 ISPs, can you really call it decentralzied?

False. 4 2.5 minute confirmations is far more secure than 1 10 minute one. Let's say one person with 25% hashing power attempts to double spend. There's a 25% chance that with 1 confirmation they will be capable of double spending, and a less than 1 in 1% chance of them succeeding with 4 confirmations. Both in the same amount of time

If you pay nothing it will likely take a long time to get confirmed or sent. The current standard transaction fee is like 0.0001 BTC, which is about 9 cents. It's pretty subtle compared to a credit card, it's just more noticeable since it's placed on the consumer rather than the merchant. Buying a $50 item may cost $1.50 in credit card transaction fees, but 10 cents in Bitcoin fees.

Yes, I know they like to get paid. Which is why I'm posting this to Bitcoin would allow for an anonymous way for people to make a payment so that they can anonymously get help.
All they gotta do is partner with Bitpay or coinbase, auto convert to USD, and pay their employees.
It would take a lot of money to startup, hence why it isn't something I can do myself. It would take an entrepreneur with plenty of capital that believes in the idea to develop it. It's not an easy thing to make. Gotta develop the backend of the site, need to find professionals to hire, need to develop infrastrucure. It isn't something just anyone can start up if they want it to be a quality service and not just [THIS](
The biggest issue in terms of payment is that it isn't something insurance will cover. So paying large fees like $300 an hour isn't affordable for a lot of people since they would be paying out of pocket. But it can probably help some people in some situations.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:50:25
If there were that many transactions, the price would likely be much higher, which would mean that the transaction fee would be much lower(in BTC).
For example if Bitcoin was used as much as credit cards(IE 1000 tps), then it would likely be worth well over $100,000/BTC, which means the transaction fee would probably be like 1 uBTC. That's less than .6 in transaction fees for the average 10m block assuming 1k tps.

-Moore's law will come to an end soon
-The blockchain continues to grow at a faster rate as more and more bitcoin transactions happen daily
-Without raising the block size limit, the protocol won't be able to support much more growth
-Miners refuse to raise their block caps anyways, because the tx fees are not worth the risk of an orphan block
I literally cannot wait for the block reward halving. Once the block rewards get low enough like 12.5 or 6.25, miners might actually start to include more transactions.

I agree with you that democracy is a flawed system that creates a false sensation of freedom, but using the "drugs have never done anything wrong" card as a desperate attempt to appeal to the reddit majority leads me to disagree with you.
I have no problem with anyone smoking Marijuana, or using any drug that is illegal, or selling it, but to act as if no regulations should be put on such substances isn't very open minded. Yes, I think they should be legal, but reddit's blind support of it is what makes me upset. You still need laws preventing people from operating dangerous machinery or driving while high, you still need laws regulating its distribution(to avoid lacing, lack of health warnings, etc). We can't just blindly legalize drugs because we like them, we need to consider the risks it has on others and the potential economic benefits and problems.
My look on the world is that an individual should have the right to do as they please, as long as their actions don't negatively impact others. Want to get high on some messed up drug? I could care less. You might be harming your health in the long term, but its your choice-you feel as if the feeling you get from the drug is worth it. On the other hand, if a drug severely impacts your mental ability, you shouldn't be able to cause a risk for others. If this drug is known to impair senses for x amount of time, you shouldn't be able to drive or work in a high risk field for that time. It's just in the interest of others. Much like drinking and driving causes accidents, driving while high on many drugs also causes accidents.
As for distributors of such drugs, they should be required to properly warn of all risks(much like the surgeon general warnings on cigarettes). People should be allowed to make choices regarding their body, even if seen as foolish by others.
I apply this "an individual should have the right to do as they please, as long as their actions don't negatively impact others." rule to everything, not just drugs. I personally don't do any drugs, but I don't mind others doing it as long as they don't put others at risk. This is not the case in America, lobbyists and the public majority decide what is legal. Plenty of victimless crimes exist because the majority wants to criminalize it. Take obscene content for example, you can get arrested for it even if you do not distribute it to minors or unconsenting adults. Simply possessing content that the public majority deems "obscene" is enough to land you in jail, where tax dollars are spend to incarcerate someone who has done no harm to society. Originally ruled unprotected due to some guy that sent hardcore porn through the mail in order to protect those that wish not to see offensive material, this precedent makes those that keep such content to themselves at fault.

Yeah I feel conflicted too. I love Bitcoin and really want to spend it on a Zynga game to prove the point, but I never really enjoy their games and disapprove of how heavily they monetize their games in comparison to other free games. It feels like you have to spend money when you play their games.
I'll probably check out some of their games to see if there's any I may like, maybe I'll spend a couple mBTC if there's one that seems really fun.

I feel like in order for major retailers to accept Bitcoin, there would need to be a bit more consumer demand for it.
Looking at the opportunity cost of accepting Bitcoin, it may not be worth it for some of the larger retailers to accept Bitcoin at this time. The cost of updating existing infrstructure to support it(websites, PoS systems, etc), training employees to work with it, and creating policies would be quite expensive to attract what would likely be less than a 1% increase in sales, and 2-3% in transaction fees saved on that 1%.
Smaller companies looking to outperform their competition like Tigerdirect and Overstock are clever in doing so, but leading corporations in their market will not benefit enough to outweigh the costs. The only reason I see something huge like Walmart or Target accepting Bitcoin this early is if the owners themselves are supportive of it.
Obviously this will change once more people begin using Bitcoin, but until consumer demand is great enough, most won't bother. More businesses will definitely hop on board, but it will be a while until we see massive companies jumping on ship. With hardware wallets coming improving security, and Bitcoin BTMs making purchasing easy, consumer demand should grow enough for them to consider it.

@_date: 2014-08-29 16:57:47
hypothetically yes, but whether or not they could get away with it depends on the type of cloud mining.
If they say they solo mine, and you see the coins originating from a ghash.IO address(and you aren't buying from cex.io), then you know they're either buying the coins or pointing the miners there.
If they let you control the miners directly to point at your own pool, then you can know regardless if they're just buying or not.
If they just give you the coins they get over time, then you would have to see how much the coins move. I mean if they really wanted to prove they aren't buying them, they would move them straight from the mined address to the customer's wallet.

I do agree that Credit Cards are an outdated technology and are horribly insecure. But the question comes down to this- would you want to give up your fancy credit card rewards and it's simplicity of use for the sake of security? Getting your credit card information stolen sucks, but it isn't the end of the world. You contact the company, and get the transactions reversed. It may have been a hassle, and you might have been responsible for a small amount. But in the end, do you think most people would bother getting set up with Bitcoin to avoid it? Do you think people would be more scared of the lesser chance of losing all of their Bitcoin to a mistake on their end, than the chance of getting a CC # stolen?
You must keep in mind not all consumers are intelligent. People will fall victim to downloading wallet stealing malware, falling for scams, or not backing up their wallet, and by doing so they are 100% responsible for their mistakes.
Even if they only hold small amounts of Bitcoin at a time like $200 or less for online purchases, is it worth the volatility they have to put up with?

-Easier ways of buying it
Putting sensitive banking information online to an exchange or meeting a complete stranger that you don't know if you can trust is too stressful for some people, we need Cash-Bitcoin ATMs in most major cities.
-Secure, cheap, and easy to use Wallet Hardware/Software
People will be too wary to use Bitcoin for large sums of money with all of the hacking going on, there needs to be a cheap, easy to use, and appealing way to store bitcoin that even the biggest fool could do. Without this, people won't use it for much more than sending small amounts online like microtransactions, as they would be too afraid of losing it all to malware.
-More adoptation
If it becomes used more by businesses and casually across the web, people will get started. Things like Bitcoin tipping and gaming tournament rewards show others the potential of it. Seeing it used for something besides speculative value creates an image of it, and it will seem cool and convenient.

Right, because people are desperate to buy into Bitcoin when a major exchange just lost thousands of Bitcoins held by thousands of people, making the system look extremely unreliable in the eyes of someone who has never heard of it before.

You wouldn't be able to sell all of it on exchanges for an instant profit. Simply selling 6-7k Bitcoins across all the major exchanges at once is enough to crash the price $100. So they would have to hold for a while, and slowly cash out, which would be rather risky.

I'd like to see a government made proof of stake coin that is 100% premined by the government, and given away to citizens based on how much they pay prior to the premine. They would then use these funds to back the now decentralized coin by the countries own fiat currency.
Thanks to the blockchain, they can prove that they distributed all of the coins to citizens responsibly.
For example:
Citizens pay a total of $1 trillion USD.
1 Billion cryptodollars premined
0.001 cryptodollars paid out per $1 USD pledged(coins paid out proportionally by USD paid out)
1 cryptodollar would be backed by a static $1000 USD.
This would make volatility low, as it has a static backing rate and it can only go above it.

MTGOX didn't represent Bitcoin's value either when it was at $1200. It's price was always ~10% higher than other exchanges, making it a horrible measure of Bitcoin's value. Bitpay's and Coinbase's exchange rate for purchases was also much lower. People only quoted it out of blind optimism since it had the highest number. You couldn't even sell your BTC for $1,200 anyways since fiat withdrawals were impossible, so I don't see how its a fair measure. The only reason it was so high there is because people were desperately trying to get their funds out by buying BTC.
I never considered MTGOX a good indicator of Bitcoin's value, not even when it was the highest. I'm not trying to "ignore bad news". I'm a natural pessimist, and I will definitely agree that this is certainly bad for the short term success of Bitcoin.
It wasn't really a "crash" to $100. Anyone who sold at under $500 on BTC-e was an idiot. The guy who crashed the coin to $100 lost millions of dollars worth of currency-it was likely unintentional. he could have easily slowly dumped across multiple exchanges and he would have made a lot more money. The prices on Bitstamp remained above $500 even when he dumped it on BTC-e.
When the price shoots back up to $500 within less than a minute, and all other exchanges are still well above $500 the entire time, you can't really consider it a crash. That would be like me creating an exchange with next to no volume, with one guy selling 0.5 BTC and crashing the price on my exchange to $5/BTC while every other exchange is at $600. Just because 1 exchange crashes for 2 minutes doesn't mean the currency as a whole did.

I don't try to sound technical unless they ask for it.
I start by telling them about a technology that lets them send money over the internet with low fees, securely, and without having to trust an actual company like Paypal. I try to make it sound as simple as possible, and useful.
But then when the questions come in about its security and such, I'm forced to give in depth explanations to prove it. Simply saying "It's impossible at this point to hack the network to generate more than 21 million bitcoins" doesn't cut it. It sounds just like when people said the Titanic was unsinkable if I don't elaborate. I need to go in depth and explain how nodes will reject people that create fake transactions, and that the blockchain makes it clear to everyone who owns what Bitcoins and who can spend them with the concept of inputs/outputs and how mining works. This makes it sound scary and too technical, which in the end scares them away even when I emphasize how using Bitcoin is easy.

The reason the price is at $350 is because Bitcoins were never truly worth $1100 as a result of supply/demand in the first place. MTGox Ran a ponzi scheme in which they faked a pump of the price and manipulated data, then tried to cover up their insolvency by pretending to be "hacked".
Evidence supporting this:
MTGox's Bitcoin price was always $100 higher than other exchanges
Price crashed afterwards and stayed down despite growing adaptation by various merchants, and more people using Bitcoin, and more investors.

It's technically a capital gain, so that's why it's taxable. It's kinda silly since you're responsible for losing money should your investment fail, and don't get compensated for that, but the moment you make anything you're responsible for paying taxes if you sell it for USD.
The only thing I see governments taxing on Bitcoin is transactions in it if it becomes large enough that it becomes an issue. Right now Bitcoin doesn't pose a big enough threat to tax revenue, but if most places begin taking and holding it, sales tax on it may become necessary to keep funding up.

If something happens off blockchain, then it requires a third party behind it. A third party would likely charge fees, and defeat the purpose of it, as it no longer decentralized and requires trust.
If you keep the blockchain for moving large sums of money alone and capped at 1 MB, then the fees will have to be inflated to keep traffic low, and it would become much too high. What would be the purpose of Bitcoin if you need to trust a 3rd party in any small to medium sized transaction, that also charges fees, and you also have fees on larger ones as well?

Apple is widely recognized and trusted by many, Bitcoin isn't.
You fail to realize that the masses are foolish. Yes Bitcoin is superior, but why would a consumer bother to use it when Apple's service will likely be 10x easier to use? Yes it doesn't have the decentralization, yes it probably wont be as secure, but it comes from a company with a name to it. Bitcoin can be highly confusing at times to understand or even to use, Apple will probably make it pathetically easy.
This is legitimately a threat to Bitcoin if they follow through with it. 95% of consumers probably have no idea what decentralization is or why it's important. Yes it would probably have fees and appeal less to merchants, but if millions of people used it, as they do with all Apple products that are overpriced, would it really be smart not to accept it, and potentially lose customers?

There's a bit of a difference.
You can't prove to anyone that Bitcoin has any "real" value and won't crash at some point. The speculation of the future of Bitcoin is entirely opinion. We can't predict the future. You can prove to someone that bitcoin is accepted at thousands of small businesses, decentralized, open source, and a secure method of internet payments.
Basically I'm saying that some people deny bitcoin because they have the facts wrong, and others deny it because their opinion is against it. If someone says Bitcoin will never succeed because it is too volatile and not backed by anyone, that is an opinion. If someone says Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme and a scam, that is false information misleading someone into their opinion.
You can add to someone's knowledge by providing further information, but you can't change someones opinion easily.

Proof of stake should result in cheap transaction costs, depending on its implementation. There's a lot of ways to go about implementing it.
As for owning 50%, its not that likely, but for smaller altcoins, it's a risk to consider. A coin cannot start as proof of stake without some initial mining to distribute the coins, whether a premine where you trust the creator to distribute them fairly(highly frowned upon), or a mining period where people compete to hopefully distribute them fairly.
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:33:19
At least with Bitcoin it doesn't. Electricity costs on ASICs are negligible compared to initial hardware costs, so people will continue to mine even when the price tanks. Other SHA-256 coins like PPC are rarely more profitable, so everyone mines BTC.
With any scrypt altcoins  a price tank would lead to people mining another coin, or stopping until the difficulty drops since electricity costs are high for GPUs.

Yes, this is another problem that is closely related. The problem is entirely in Bitcoin's reward structure. There's absolutely no way we can change the reward structure, as there's absolutely no way miners would support anything that would hinder their profits. Bitcoin's reward structure is far too inflationary at this stage, and its preventing the network from growing. In the future, when block rewards hit 0, there's nothing stopping miners from using monopoly tactics to kick out competition. This is a problem I personally cannot find a solution to, other than hoping it works itself out with time.
In the past we've seen that as it becomes necessary for miners to increase block size, they've done it. It's in the best interest for miners for Bitcoin to survive, so they likely will increase their own block sizes if it has to be done for Bitcoin's value to stay up.

But is Bitcoin a unit of account? No, it isn't. Items are not denominated in Bitcoin, they're demoninated in USD or Euros. The purchasing power of other currencies aren't affected when Bitcoin Rises. Bitcoin's price could go to $100,000 and I wouldn't notice any difference as a user of USD(unless I wanted to buy Bitcoin). Bitcoin's purchasing power declines when its value decreases.
Even Bitcoin related companies like ASIC sellers and hardware wallet manufacturers denominate their costs in USD.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:33:55
the transaction shows up almost instantly, but it is "verified" when a block is solved. The more blocks that go by, the more proof there is that there is no double spend. It's highly unlikely that someone would bother to attempt a double spend against a small purchase like $200 of groceries, so forcing a customer to wait 5-20 minutes or more for a confirmation isn't worth it. The only time you really need multiple confirmations is if you sell expensive goods like cars(which tbh could probably be traced anyways via the license plate/registration info and thus not needed), or run a gambling site which may be exploited.
Basically, you can see that they sent the coins within seconds, but you don't have proof that it isn't double spent until 1 or more blocks verify it. Double spending is something most people don't know how to do as it is an exploit. There's far more risk of someone performing credit card chargebacks/using counterfeit cash/check fraud than doing a bitcoin double spend.
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:40:58
My guess is time. Bitcoin slowly grows, and once people have known relatives and such that get into it, they may try themselves. It continues to grow. It can be compared much to how email and personal computers grew, the only difference with Bitcoin is that it's a bit more difficult due to money being involved.

People are spending their Bitcoin, most of the vendors that take Bitcoin use a service like Bitpay or Coinbase that immediately sell the coin for USD. Since people are spending, and what they spend is immediately sold, the demand to sell is increased.
This is still good for Bitcoin as the infrastructure behind it backs its value. While the value may not be going to the moon right now, it allows it to be much more stable, and it won't crash nearly as hard as it has in the past if speculation drives the price up. The price will come up soon once Bitcoin becomes easier to use/acquire for consumers and investors get involved with it, the time will come.

Eventually mining rewards will become negligible, then nothing at all. Transaction fees will become the primary incentive to mine. Ideally if Bitcoin gains more widespread usage, coins will be sent much more frequently, be worth more, and more transacted fees will be collected since more take place. Right now most people are storing their Bitcoin in speculation, and don't have a ton of uses, but if/once it makes its way to everyday use, people will spend much more frequently(in addition to more users)
Let's go to the extreme and pretend Bitcoin becomes the primary means of exchange 100 years from now. Say 1 BTC is worth the equivalent of what $1 million is worth now. If a transaction fee is 0.1 uBTC, that's roughly 10 cents. If 600,000 transactions take place in a block(1000 a second, I think Visa does more), then you have an average reward of  60 mBTC, which would be worth $60,000. This allows for mining to be much larger than it is now in terms of the market available for it off of transaction fees alone. Gigabit internet is starting to grow, and can likely support this many transactions if it becomes available to most people.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:01:42
as for  Scrypt-n(used by Vertcoin) is good at preventing ASICs.
Due to high memory requirements, its very difficult to create an efficient ASIC that beats GPUs.
 Due to memory adjustments, a created ASIC would cease to function after every block change.
Due to the anti-ASIC nature of the coin, people are willing to hard fork if ASICs become a problem.
@_date: 2014-05-15 02:29:36
Wow, that's a fairly large tip. Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:46:43


Considering that by then only the people with the most efficient ASICs will be able to profit, you'll likely see fees jacked up to as high as the rough equivalent of $1 or $2. Miners can temporarily accept free transactions to drive out all competition, then when they mine alone they can charge massive fees since no one can afford to develop a better ASIC to compete, and if they do, they just get knocked out.
ASICs will be the death of Bitcoin.

Are you saying that to critique the fact that I said medical records de-anonymize a person, thus are unable to be anonymously received? I see your point. Not having medical records is a type of missing information. You also can't do standard things like checking blood pressure or pulse over the internet(unless the client goes and buys a device that plugs into the computer and figures out how to use it).
There difference here though is that the person knows the information is missing, and can account for that and ask things they know are important.
I mean its unlikely you need to need to share your blood type, height, and many other things when discussing a mental disorder, so the entire thing isn't really needed.
The psychologist could still ask important questions. Are they currently taking any medicine, have they been diagnosed with anything before, etc. It wouldn't be as good as raw information I'm sure, as a lot is missing, but I'm sure it's something.

For them, it's good. For others, it comes down to personal opinion. Bitcoin, in its current state, is not for everyone. If you aren't careful, you can easily lose your Bitcoin to a variety of things: Online wallet hacks, wallet stealing malware, HDD failure without proper backups, forgetting passphrase, and so much more.
It isn't really a viable payment method for everyone yet. Not everyone figures out how to set up cold storage and remember their passphrase. Now, it would still be good if they accepted Bitcoin as people like you and me would like it. But to the average consumer, they're simply expressing why they would not like to use it. Nothing wrong with that.

But if Bitcoin grew 1000x bigger and became a universal currency like everyone here on wants it to be, the wasted electricity would be disasterous. Given 1000x the value, we would eventually see 1000x the electricity usage to meet the profits.
This is a massive waste of resources. Miners aren't using the power to "process transactions", they're spending tons of power to get the right to process the transactions.

It's inevitable that it will happen in 100 years when transaction fees become the only means of incentive assuming we change nothing. In fact, it would be worse than Visa/Mastercard since it is unregulated and that competition is based on raw computing power. As long as ASICs exist, it will be a giant computational arms race and monopoly.
ASIC manufacturers may withhold the devices for themselves if Bitcoin became large enough. The richest ones could temporarily accept transactions with no fees to ensure that other miners would not profit(since no one would include fees). This would kick out new miners as they would be mining at a loss.
The fact that you need to develop a powerful ASIC also increases the barrier of entry for competition. It costs millions just to design a competitive ASIC now, and it will grow more expensive as they grow better. New startups would just get kicked out by a temporary 0 fee campaign(common monopoly tactic to slash prices, illegal in a regulated market). The monopoly owner then could charge as high of fees as they rant, and rip people off as they prevent other hashing power by making it impossible to compete.
Unless we fork to scrypt-n, and include a small minimal block reward(&lt;0.1% annual inflation, in comparison Bitcoin is at ~7% annual inflation currently) it's guarenteed to happen. A tiny block reward would ensure that a monopoly owner cannot kick other new miners out by slashing fees temporarily until they go bankrupt. Scrypt-n would ensure that most average users could mine to compete without a huge barrier of entry, as GPUs/CPUs are available to the general public. Since they have more uses than mining, they should remain available to the public and powerful for everyone.
If you argue that the same thing would happen with GPUs as with ASICs, I completely disagree. ASICs are used solely for mining, so there is no other incentive to create them than for monetary usage. GPUs are used worldwide for everything from graphical rendering/simulation to games to animation. This means that powerful GPUs will be sold to the public as they have more value. While the best GPUs may be kept private, they should not be much more powerful or energy efficient as those publicly sold. This means that people can reasonably compete with home computers, unlike with Bitcoin where an ASIC is thousands of times faster than a GPU.

After Numerous issues with credit card fraud due to online merchants being hacked, I deeply despite using credit cards online. In order to protect my credit rating and finances, I'd prefer to pay with bitcoin.
I've tried paypal, but I've had numerous issues with them. Bitcoin would allow me to pay securely, and there would be absolutely no fees on your end, and no risk of chargeback fraud. To ensure no risks, and easy integration, I recommend using a processor such as Bitpay or Coinbase that instantly converts payments into USD or the relevant currency your company uses, in order to avoid any volatility risks.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:12:29
How is the risk of double spending a 0 confirm transaction small? I don't think there's any law regarding double spending as Bitcoin is a new concept, so theoretically people could abuse the shit about it without being prosecuted.

while credit cards have 3% higher fees on the merchants end, with Bitcoin merchants usually aren't liable for things like credit card fraud, or in the case of Bitcoin, double spends. The only liability would be if Coinbase/Bitpay got hacked and couldn't afford to pay their merchants.

I agree that Bitcoin needs to increase the maximum block size, however I disagree with this approach. It can lead to the size growing too quickly when it isn't needed-it's much better to use the size of previous blocks to determine if the maximum size needs to be raised, and increase it at a rate capped at something much like what Gavin proposed.
This way block sizes don't get out of hand making it too hard to host on a consumer machine if it isn't needed, but it will grow if adaptation grows.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:40:29

If the price is down, its cheap coins due to market manipulation! Now is the best time to buy!

Well, there's a few downsides to using p2pool.
The first is inconsistency. If you have low hashing power, it may take you forever to even find a share. For example, mining on p2pool with an old 10 GH/s ASIC isn't very reliable.
The second is lack of tracking services. While some mining pools offer all sorts of worker statistics, p2pool can't really provide much due to shares being hard to find and it being decentralized. So you'll need to use another program to monitor your miners when away, instead of just logging onto the pool website.
The last is that it can be a bit more difficult to set up than a regular pool. You need to run a full node, which takes up a lot of bandwidth and about 20 GB(and growing) of storage. So if you have limited data, it may not be for you.
There are also advantages to using p2pool:
1. helping decentralize the network
2. Because there's no central operator, there's no risk of the pool getting hacked and your balance being lost
3. No fees!

I asked them to check their email, they said that all the emails are about BTC they received, and there's no "confirmation" email.
Sounds like they're using the vault based on the images I've seen. Does it ever take longer than 48 hours, or does it sometimes take longer? It's been like 51 hours so far.
I feel bad wasting their time with all these complications, they're a business after all. Saving on 3% fees really isn't worth how complicated this is. I'll guess I'll give it one more day for the withdrawal to go through, and if it doesn't work, I guess I'll tell them that I'll just use Paypal for their convenience.
Also, I think they get this when they click on it- no insructions provided, and their wallet account still says 0 balance:

Why do you consider the Dogecoin "leaders" evil? They work on developing the coin without pay in their spare time.
IMO its a lot better than the "Bitcoin Foundation" that has/had members that did morally questionable things, and receives pay for what they do, all while requiring you to be rich(in BTC) to join.
There's plenty of reasons to hate on Dogecoin, such as originating as a joke, but at least make rational arguments.

nowhere near 20,000 per second, but a lot higher. 20MB is 20x higher, so maybe about 40-50 transactions per second.

I hate to ask this, but is there a way to set it up to temporarily throttle the speed? My brother and I are gamers, and it can cause lag at times. Whenever someone needs to download the blockchain and uses all of my bandwidth, we get high ping in games. I don't want to close my node completely whenever I game, so I just wish I could cap it at 500 KB/s or so while gaming, then leave it uncapped otherwise.

Please research things before pretending like you know what you're talking about.
An optical computer shines a low-power laser through a series of grids containing millions of "pixels" that diffuses the light to solve a variety of mathematical operations. Current silicon-based chips are limited by heat generation, and fail at parallel tasks due to poor data management(as multi core cpus technically operate in serial, and communicate with each core). Optical computing operates true parallel on a hardware level. Optical computers are limited only by the speed of light, and how small you can make the grids that light shines through.
As Moore's law reaches its limits with silicon, optical computing will provide a new way to reach more power efficient and high power computing solutions at affordable costs. Optical computing makes use of 3 dimensions through light and grids, unlike silicon chips that are simply circuits on a circuit board. It can operate at a much higher frequency, complete more tasks at the same time, and use less power/generate less heat than traditional computing methods.

If we intended to fork on purpose, we would update the software ahead of time, coded to implement the new change at block # something. That way, everyone forks at the same time and there will be no downtime during the fork.
The only difficult part with a fork would be to convince the community and industry that the fork is a good idea. If exchanges, miners, the majority of users, and Bitcoin payment processors don't all upgrade their wallets prior to the fork, it could mean absolute economical disaster.

Yes, his change only increases the max block size. The problem is though, that if the maximum size is too high, there could be miners that create blocks so large that it becomes very hard to download and store the blockchain.

Small barrier to entry now, but future regulation could increase the barrier. If other companies don't see more success now, they may be unable to enter certain markets such as in the US due to not having the capital to meet regulations.

Agreed, ASICs make cpu mining negligible, and most people don't have a decent amd gpu that would hash quickly. The few gamers that actually have a high end amd gpu would likely notice the botnet and find a way to get rid of it.
There's no way more than 1 PH/s could come from a botnet. That would be like millions of gpus and cpus to achieve. And if the botnet operator wanted to make money, he would direct it at altcoins instead where cpu and gpu mining makes far more than Bitcoin.

Other altcoins have their prices directly correlated to Bitcoin, especially the ones without USD exchanges.  So when Bitcoin goes up 200%, altcoins often go up 200%, which increases demand for GPUs to mine those.

You realize that the massive amount of growth may in fact have been  partially market manipulation by MTGox, which would then explain the subsequent dump in price? I wouldn't be shocked to find out that MTGox was running an internal ponzi scheme and fractional reserve at some point before they went insolvent.
I'm sure Bitcoin's price has grown due to increased usage, but I honestly think there's a high probability that MTGox manipulated the market to pump up the price. It seems bizarre that Bitcoin has grown significantly in the past year, that the price has only dropped further.

Saving 2-3% on fees and being able to send money without a bank account won't end world poverty. The poor will still be poor. Bitcoin is great and all but stop pretending like it's the magical solution to everything.
This is just like what George Orwell conveyed in 1984... the rich try their best to stay rich, the middle class try to overthrow the upper class, and the middle class promises the poor that it will help them if they follow a movement, and what ends up happening is the rich and the middle class swap places, while the poor remain poor.
The rich are the bankers, the "middle class" are the Bitcoin advocates that are heavily invested, and the poor are those just struggling to pay rent.

When it comes to pushing for fast food places to accept Bitcoin, I recommend targeting the ones with internet order support. Chances are franchise owners won't want to have to train their employees to deal with a Bitcoin transaction, and they won't want to have to update PoS machines to be Bitcoin compatible. Lastly, it can cause issues with the line line if someone is having trouble with their Bitcoin wallet(can't scan qr code, mistyped passphrase, etc)
Web orders, on the other hand, can be made easy due to handling payments automatically without the average worker their needing to deal with payment. Web orders are the perfect start, and if it sees widespread usage, perhaps they'll expand it to in-store payments.

 Someone sees they can save $40 if they pay with Bitcoin. They decide to look up what Bitcoin is, decide to buy $100 worth on Coinbase. Goes to transact with the guy, realize their $100 of Bitcoin is only worth $90 now. Go to buy $10 more, but when it arrived now they only have $97 worth.

What if the printer has spyware on it that sends the printed documents to a third party? Most printers made nowadays have firmware on them, and you need a device to send to it.
You have to generate the address somehow, right? You need hardware of some sort to do it, unless you find a way to do it on pen and paper... What stops spyware from tracking the address generation?
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:34:13
The block size limit needs to be raised, but Gavin's proposal by itself doesn't work. It raises the limit far too quickly, and is only a guess at what we'd need. A [dynamic system]( that bases the growth of the cap based on the average/mean size of previous blocks is a much better alternative
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:36:06

Uh, Bitcoin may be secure, but it's only as secure as secure as your employees. Sure, you can use multi-sig addresses, but it only takes a couple bad employees that have access to them to cause problems.

We need to rush to increase awareness of bitcoin before this happens. Contact your local business owner and encourage them to accept bitcoin, tell your friends, family, and peers. This will likely take chase a while to make, so we have time. However, it is incredibly important that bitcoin gains widespread adoption if we want it to be the dominant means of internet trade or other electronic currency. To the average consumer, a centralized currency delivered by a well known organization with a likely simple interface is far more capable of being trusted by the masses than some decentralized internet currency with no known origin. If chase releases this before bitcoin receives widespread adoption to the point where a large and noticeable portion of businesses accept bitcoin, the currency will fail to spread and it will remain small.
We overestimate the average consumer. Most people don't understand the purpose of the currency being decentralized, are too afraid to use it due to the complications of securing it and using it, and don't trust it as there is no name behind it.

Just because a cryptocurrency is asic resistant and mined with GPU/CPUs doesn't mean it prevents a single entity from controlling the network. If a specific cryptocurrency grew to be the primary means of exchange, and used CPU/GPU as the most effective method of mining, AMD/NVIDIA/INTEL would effectively control the economy, as they can release and sell their chips as they see fit at whatever price they want.
Sure, it's great for a small network where a large company like AMD sees no reason in attempting to control a network like litecoin as their business is much larger, but if it became huge and bigger than the company itself, they have a reason to control it, and it allows the market to be central to them.

A lot of people will defend ghash.io because their double spending attacks are against gambling websites, which is a controversial issue because many believe it spams the blockchain and are a waste of data, while others believe that they should be protected and are a type of freedom. I don't think they double spend against "legitimate" sales, but even if their attacks are meant to serve the purpose to stop the use of bitcoin for gambling, doesn't that go against what a lot of people like Bitcoin for, consumer freedom to use their money how they see fit, free from a central authority telling them what to do?
I don't think they have an intent to destroy bitcoin, as that would lose them money, but I am mildly skeptical that they may want to control it in some way, and run it the way they see fit.

I feel like there's still opportunity for the value to increase massively. Bitcoin still has plenty of room for growth, most people still haven't heard of it, and it's very rarely accepted in retail or by major corporations.
I'm a bit frustrated though because I'm 17, and I can't really convince my parents to let me invest in something so risky. So I've just been mining litecoin in hopes of trading that in for bitcoin and offering to teach people programming online in a desperate attempt to earn some myself.
I just feel so bad letting such a thing pass by with no real way of getting involved, I've been researching it extensively the past few weeks and it fascinates me, I feel like I'm going to cringe a year from now with whatever happens.

Your wallet.dat file contains the information needed to view and send your funds. This file has something called a "private key" in it, which essentially is what is used to be able to send your funds and prove that you own them. It actually has 100 or so keys by default.

Yes but for smaller transactions, you really only need 1 confirmation. It's not likely that someone will attempt to double spend and overpower the network for a small transaction, so 1 confirmation is likely enough for anything small like a restaurant bill or small retail purchase, it isn't until you get into things like cars or other expensive purchases where you want to sit and wait for several confirmations.
Basically I feel like litecoin is more practical for everyday use for this purpose, although I'm fairly certain that it will die out at some point due to the overwhelming growth of bitcoin outshining it- people aren't going to bother to make the change or buy litecoin when bitcoin is adapted by more people already and accepted much more frequently.
Then again, for all we know they could complete and work side by side, just like how places accept multiple payment methods such as cash, checks(not that common anymore), debit cards, and multiple credit cards.

Also, using your credit card gives the informated needed to spend your money to the person you're buying from. With bitcoin, this isn't the case as they only see your public key and not the private key needed to send your funds.
This makes bitcoin a lot safer, especially for online purchases. I don't like entering credit card info online for a small business because of the risk, but with bitcoin it's risk free besides the risk of a scam.

I think bitcoin will succeed, but I feel like this reason isn't necessarily true. While people like me, as well as many of the other enthusiasts that use the currency find it very fun to use,  many may find it confusing to use. I was really confused when I first started, and I'm highly involved with technology and have a good understanding of computers and networking. I can only imagine how overwhelmed the average consumer might be with the currency, I can see them making stupid mistakes like sending to the wrong address or messing up a decimal when sending only to send 10x as much, or not noticing something is in mBTC or BTC.
I'm enjoying using bitcoin, and I find it to be absolutely awesome that I can send payments over the internet instantly and securely with no fees, but I'm not sure that every consumer would find it "fun".

Apple likes to ban any innovative technology that competes with theirs. They will remove any third party applications that do something their devices can do already, even if they do it better. This is why I hate Apple. Bitcoin is just one example of a technology they won't allow. Everyone admires apple for being "innovative", when in reality they prevent any innovation that isn't done by them. They do make quality products with an extremely user friendly interface, but other than that they are the complete opposite to innovative.

I think it would need to:
-Become easier to use. as of right now backing up your wallet with encryption and paper wallets and all that is far too confusing for the average consumer.

The reason it isn't a perfect store of wealth is because it's super risky. You never know if the value of it will tank. Imagine if you put your savings into it back when it was over $1200, only for the price to tank to $600, and it turns out you need money asap to cover emergency expenses.

I'm a bit confused about how the "keypool" in bitcoin-QT works. If I understand correctly, there's 100 keys that get saved to a backup, and if you create more than 100 new addresses, the backup could potentially begin to lose coins? Also does sending bitcoin use 1 key per time you send it? Does receiving bitcoin use up a key?
How often should I have to renew the backup of my bitcoin wallet to ensure I won't lose any as a result of a hard drive failure?  As long as I renew the backup every 50 transactions or so  assuming I don't create a ton of addresses I won't lose any coins if I have to restore from it, right? I'm rather confused.

You won't make any money by mining bit coin, the electricity costs will cost more than you get from mining. Your best hope is to buy bitcoin and hope it goes well, but to be honest nobody has any clue what will happen to it. It's absolute chaos atm. It could go up tremendously, or it could fall further. Nobody knows. I personally feel like it'll grow more over the next week as more people get involved with it because of media coverage, but that's just my gut instinct.

A lot of people see litecoin as superior to bitcoin because its algorithm used for mining makes ASIC's harder to make, allowing for mining to be profitable with video cards, unlike bitcoin which requires investments into ASIC machines that cost thousands of dollars to even hope to profit from. Basically, mining is more "fair" in litecoin than bitcoin, which is the sole reason people care for it.
The primary stance here is that litecoin doesn't do enough to be superior to bitcoin, so the people who use it are just people hoping to get rich like those who adopted bitcoin early did, as it has very  little advantage as a currency over bitcoin.

It's possible that bitcoin could become the worldwide standard and replace traditional currency. The vast majority of people don't use bitcoin at the time, imagine how much larger it will get as more people seek to purchase bitcoin and adapt to it. It's already increased like 1000% in like 6 months from its grwoth, I would not be surprised if it did again within a year.
It's possible, but most certainly guaranteed. No one knows what will happen. I don't know how much btc you have, but I personally would cash out part of it and save part of it. That way if it increases further or becomes a standard I have some, and I still would have profited a ton.

Yes mining processes transactions, but in the end its a huge arms race of hashing power to determine who finds the block and is able to process those transactions. It helps decentralize it by randomizing it proportional to who has the strongest mining capabilities, but the speed at which these transactions is processed is separate.

Idk, I like my computer being quiet when I'm browsing the web. I don't want my cpu/gpu fan to go berserk when I'm simply reading.
Then again it already does because I mine altcoins with it, so it would fuck up my mining.

1: When mining rewards end, there will be a total of 21 million in existance. It's the way block rewards work, they get halved about every 4 years until they have no reward. Some may be lost forever, but its infinitely divisble so it doesn't matter. Basically, the rate at which they are mined is predetermined, and adjusted based on hashpower, so that they will be found at a set rate.
2.Hardware performes intensive guess and check calculations to attempt to "solve" a block, by getting the number that makes it less than another. If your computer solves the block, it gets to relay the block and process the transactions during that block, and also gets rewarded the bitcoin bounty(currently 25 BTC). This is known as "proof of work", and hashing power acts of a method of decentralizing who relays the blocks and transactions.
3.You won't make any profits mining. The only ways to make reasonable btc mining is by buying ASIC machines that cost thousands of dollars, and even then it's likely you won't make a ROI.
4.You can consider it a currency, though a lot of people view it as a commodity since it isn't widely used as a currency(businesses that accept it usually convert it to USD/ other local currency right away).

Oh nice, you're lucky your parents will let you invest in something so risky :P my dad is smart enough to recognize that there's potential in bitcoin, but he doesn't want me to throw any money at it to invest- so I just mine altcoins on my gaming rig and trade em for bitcoin. Made a fair sum so far. Sad thing is, he won't let me use my bitcoin to purchase parts to build a new mining rig, so I guess I'ma just hold.

The only company that has "revealed" ASIC scrypt miners have offered no proof that they actually work.

Not really a fair comparison when the banking system is used by significantly more people(think 500x or more)
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:32:29
Doubt it will make people sell. Everyone currently with  a significant amount of bitcoin probably would have already sold if they are going to, a cartoon character admitting to losing it won't change their decisions.
If anything, it will scare potential buyers away from getting started with bitcoin since the first thing they hear about it is a crash.

Ah thanks, I remember reading about some pool that inserted bible quotes in blocks or something like that, didn't know that was them.

I still don't see Litecoin having much potential from a currency standpoint. The only real advantage it has over bitcoin is that mining is more fair, and that the blocks are faster allowing for more speedy confirmation.
Bitcoin is well known, and for a currency to be usable it would need purposes. Bitcoin has the potential to be used for all sorts of things like retail and internet purchases, litecoin hasn't been heard of very much by consumers so it has little purpose except being theoretically valuable.
I personally am mining litecoin to trade for bitcoin, but I may hold onto a little litecoin in case it goes up in value, say if it is perhaps used for smaller transactions(come to think of it, more people mining might make transaction fees less expensive, and alongside 2.5 minute confirmations, it may prove to be better for small purchases)

Wait what town?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:57:49
if you can find someone IRL willing to trade with you, it's possible. Other than that I think there's a few exchanges that allow for small purchases(like less than 1 BTC), but I'm not sure.
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:29:13
Good point. Better that we encounter a problem and be forced to fix it when bitcoin is still small and can recover, than for something to happen after mass adoptation, only to cause serious global economic issues.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:43:11
Yes, but with it being said in person and likely being covered by newspapers/news stations etc, there's huge potential for growth as people try to get bitcoin thinking it will increase in value.

Try mining litecoin, its value has skyrocketed recently making it highly profitable. I'm making about $8 a day mining with my amd radeon 7870, trading half of it for bitcoin so that I have money in both.
Mining on a laptop is a bad idea though, they usually dont have good gpus and arent built for intensive tasks.

Once Bitcoins atms become widespread enough to where there's one within a reasonable distance of most people, we may see mass adoptation. The main thing preventing growth of Bitcoin at the moment is that it's a pain to buy Bitcoin, you either need to put a ton of banking information online and wait weeks to get verified, or find a complete stranger nearby that you hope doesn't trick you.

As a senior in highschool, nearly every one of my peers I've told about bitcoin has been fascinated by it, for various reasons.  The only one not interested is my 15 year old brother, who has never really showed an interest in money. Some are simply fascinated by its rapid increase in value, some in the technology itself, and a fair portion just over the fact that drugs are sold using it. It's shocking how much teenagers care about this currency, I go to a school with one of the worst test averages in the state, where people don't seem to care about their future, and yet so many people seek to learn more about this highly technical advancement.
