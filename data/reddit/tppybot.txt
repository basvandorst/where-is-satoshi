Thanks for the feedback. That's a good idea. Right now there's only endless arcade mode, so failing\(game over/ending\) you see is inevitable. But if there's challenge mode, landing on the moon could be a nice ending for each level.

Good point, I'll make some adjustments to the 1up button for the paid users. Thanks a lot for supporting my game!

**Pumpy Coin** \- A crypto pixel arcade game where player needs to connect the blockchain blocks in order to pump up the crypto score/price. Levels are procedurally generated with difficulty curve and there are also unlockable crypto characters available.
**BONUS**: You can actually see the real market price of the cryptocoin you are playing at the bottom of the screen. So you are not only playing the game but also tracking the crypto market.
 \- Youtube [Trailer](
 \- Download free on [App Store](
I joined the crypto world at the beginning of this year\(bought bitcoin and some altcoin\), and I have been checking the price on platforms like coinbase a lot. Since I like to play arcade games as well, I thought "why not combining both?". Therefore, I made this game that is inspired by the cryptocurrency phenomenon and combined with the popular flappy gameplay mechanic. So yeah please check it out, any feedback is appreciated and let me know if there's any feature you would like to have in the future update! 
Thanks for reading and have a nice PUMPY day!
