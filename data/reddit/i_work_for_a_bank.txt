99% of those sellers are not in Australia - that cash exits the Australian bank system entirely.

Always helps to change the topic when loosing an argument, right?
I said 51% of Aussies will never be able to afford a home in their lifetime, which is not the same as how many own a home right now.
I am quoting the the 2016 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics (HILDA) Survey findings - not opinion, and not spin-doctored facts.
Do what I suggested - read a newspaper.

99%+ of those sellers are not in Australia.  You're right that the money stays in the *banking* system, just not in the **Australian** banking system.  That's why the banks are blocking transfers to Australian exchange operator accounts - because those accounts are pumping $millions out of the Australian system.

Sloshing around - yes.  Leaving permanently into foreign accounts thus debasing their cash reserve requirements and putting their lending lending business and profits at risk - no.

 - please read up on what fractional reserve means; your misconception is very common, and you do need to re-read the definition several times in order to overcome the disbelief.
Your housing loan, for real, is almost entirely non-existent invented money that banking regulations have allowed the bank to create out of thin air.  True.  Sad, but True.
This is why housing prices are impossibly high - it's logically impossible for houses to be broadly unaffordable unless "fake money" has been introduced to cause them to appreciate that far.

I am saying that, on average, Australians account for far less than 1 % of the owners of bitcoins (they're only 0.3% of the worlds' population), so for every $100 spent on bitcoins, only $1 stays in Australian banks.

Hyperinflation hits, on average, one new **country** every year.  Would you rather have cash in your pocket, or bitcoin?  What if your cash was Venezuelan or Zimbabwean?  The most elegant aspect of Crypto is that it insulates the holder against the ineptitude of their own government (and inflation).  The ones in pain will be the same ones whose property investments have stolen the quality-of-life from our children.

50% / 50% at this stage:
    ...
ABC last night carried a "2017 in review" half-hour special, which dedicated half it's summary to potential housing price collapse, including numerous interviews with experts (although no mention of bitcoin, despite it featuring almost nightly in their financial news for months now).  
We're also reading increasingly frequent stories about price decline which started in October (after 18 months of rise), and sales are down 25% since a year ago.
Ordinarily, I'd say property investment is now a major risk here, however, Government does what it can to keep things alive (like their $10bn cash-printing to prevent the GFC run causing panic), and the average politician in Australia owns twice as many houses as the average investor does, so that's a lot of incentive to prevent catastrophe.
A whole new inquiry is now set after the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, CBA, [was found laundering money]( ($77M since 2012), so 2018 is going to put an extremely uncomfortable focus on bank behavior, and if this new wave of complaints finds it's way into scope, we have the makings of an incredibly large scandal on our hands.
Now to answer your interesting question: If a bank prevents a customer buying bitcoin, they have in effect taken steps which have directly caused the price to bitcoin to be lower (since the customer was unable to buy).  Now if that bank itself makes any investment in blockchain, it's begins a journey towards serious market-manipulation criminal behavior.  All banks have blockchain on their agenda - the ASX is itself even committed.
The opposing forces are public push-back, which has to outweigh political property-investment greed (and political influence has to outweigh judicial process along with that) - which I think is an even match.
So I'd say a 50% / 50% chance that Aussie Crypto will get unbanked in 2018.  It's technically a crime (which they will "spin" as "protecting" us), but they've got to do *something* to stop the housing bubble bursting.  So when they say "protecting us" they're actually being honest.  Except "us" means property investors, not crypto investors of course.

It's crypto in general (*perhaps* excluding Aussie coins like POWR), not bitcoin specifically.

Every bank has a different POLI interface - only ANZ allowed POLI to use customer passwords - the rest do not work that way (poli redirect to your real bank for the login step of the transfer).
This is why some exchanges refuse to accept ANZ POLI deposits - it's because the *exchange* (not the bank) actually cares about customer safety, and they refuse in principal to be complicit in that rank disregard for customer security.

I believe the appropriate response is JFGI.
If you have not read the real-estate headlines in Australia this year, you really shouldn't expose your ignorance of our housing situation. 51% is fact.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:51:31
Survey sufficient housing experts, and you'll arrive at the 30%-overpriced consensus for Australian Property (or pick up a newspaper).
So the question becomes: Will crypto be 30% less at the end of next year, than it is right now?
That's what I mean about risk: loosing 30% on a house is inevitable according to experts.  What you can make or loose on crypto is anyone's guess - however - the more people make, the higher that risk of 30% housing collapse as more and more people turn away from houses to crypto.
And don't forget to factor in the 51% of Australia's population who no longer have any hope of ever buying a house in the first place.  The banks need those people to keep their money with the bank, so they can write loans to the other 49%.  These are the mum-and-dad hopefuls, investing all they can afford in crypto - ironically, for the most part, in an effort to one-day afford a house.  Perhaps, when their dreams come true, they'll be buying their house in bitcoin from a bankrupted property investor?

Australia is one of a handful of countries who do not use the fractional reserve system, we use an entirely different system based on cash deposit holdings instead.  This alone is an interesting abuse of power - our big 4 banks enjoy different reserve rules as compared with all their competitors.
Back before the RBA took control, the average Australian could pay off a house in 8 years on 25% of their wage.
As of around mid 2017, the average Australian is no longer able to afford to pay of a house at all in their lifetime.

How small does it need to be to make a difference?  How long can you hold your breath?  Does 1 second more make a difference?  If you're drowning, and you come up for air 1 second before you must breath, it sure does!
Now what if it's $1 instead of 1second? Keep in mind that every $1 that heads into foreign crypto investment adds $98 of financial strain on bank lending.  Can they hold their breath for another one and a half *minutes* instead?
Restrictions on crypo investment is not them being mean to customers, it's them going red in the face and gasping for air.

The problem is that 99% of those leather wallets are offshore - it's not arriving back into a big-4 account - that handful of notes literally vanish (their existence in the first place was illusion based on the imaginary money the banks invented when they wrote past loans against real cash, but which now must be somehow un-invented because that "real cash" has gone to another country)
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:59:34
What country does the seller of those bank in?  For most of the ASX, it's a big-4 bank that receives your money when you buy those stocks, so yes - their loans against that cash are still good.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:40:49
You hit the nail (two nails?) on the head.  The interesting problem is that the banks' denial of customer transfers to buy crypto has had at least some effect on crypto prices and customer fortunes - so if the banks were now to start selling cryptocurrencies themselves, they've engaged in and directly benefited from criminal price-altering behavior.  Right on the eve of a royal commission into banking corruption here.
This is one ugly cat that's not going back in a bag.
