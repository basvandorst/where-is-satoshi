I really don't quite like Bitmex (I think they are \*not\* real Bitcoin supporters and care solely about extracting money from people) but then again I really like keeping my 100x leveraged LONG that I set at 6008 USD / end of June. Will sell that position at about $30-50k BTC price within the next 12 months. Why sell that position at some point? Cause I don't trust Bitmex, but trust my BTC.

But let's be real, Bitcoin Cash is not nearly as nice as the drawing below

actually if you are like this, just about anywhere, you're out. that's how it goes. if you can not get the very basics right, there is just no point in talking to you or wasting time with you. we all know this. yet people continue to talk about the conman like it was important in any way. do you realize that this dude trolls at an utterly low quality and is still being talked about? I understand people follow it for the laughs but at some point it's not even funny anymore. At some point jail might be the only apt answer for the double-wide impostor to understand that people do not accept this crap without any limit.

or, step 0, read about Bitcoin in 2009--present, understand that it is an outstanding idea, and get into the ecosystem. In addition to millions of fans, there are millions of people that are against Bitcoin in the year 2018. Why look back, it's quite the same situation now. Crypto has just started, it's still tiny compared to what is to come over the years and decades. We're witnessing the full-blown cryptographic revolution and yet still very few people have realized this
