coinbase fucks you over all the time when you're trying to catch these dips (fees and averages). gdax.com is where it's at

Coinbase is a great gateway drug. Coinbase is still highly respected, but they had some support issues in the past. Yesterday they gave us an [update]( on that. Oh, and finally [segwit integration]( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:24
It directly correlates with the BTC price. 






Scale the grow from the last price surge (+- last 3 weeks) exponentially and you'll get an average. I have no info on daily sub count so I can't calculate it
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:39:06
Don't carry a hardware wallet around lol. I have the vast majority (&gt;80%) on a hardware wallet and that one is at a safe in a bank, fully insured. The rest is on a software wallet (electrum) and the exchange to do some daytrading.

Hey, I have my limit set on 51.1% daily avg. That wouldn't be a dip nor a correction, that would be a crash. That way I still make profit, have no risk and have buy orders set if they climb again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:47:27
 I'm still waiting for a huge correction. Like a 30%ATH correction, which can happen any day tbh. I bought €10k 24hrs ago and sold at €12k one hour ago. 2k short on 24 hours, one of my best ones yet :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:16
It depends how much you invested, when you started and if you have passive incomes or not. When my portfolio drops value 20% overnight it makes me sick to my stomach.

Oh yeah ofcourse. You didn't do that? It doesn't let you buy before you verify ID/passport/driver's license. ID verification took literally a few minutes back when I signed up

Get a safe deposit box at a bank for your seed and/or your hardware wallet if you're going to HODL and are forgetful. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:31:08
Don't leave it in coinbase. Especially not in an exchange(gdax). Electrum is the way to go for small to medium investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:32:29
Google Authenticator provides backup codes. They are 10 codes of random character sequences. I store those codes with my private keys of my wallet.

If you only want btc in your portfolio you can use the TREZOR. If you want to have a more diverse portfolio (which I recommend) you need something like the Ledger Nano S. This wallet can store btc, eth and altcoins. But, too be fair, if you only invest &lt; 200 USD and only want btc,  you shouldn't 'waste' the money on a hardware wallet and trust the coinbase wallet with 2FA (google authenticator &amp; password) or use 'electrum' which is a software based wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:27:41
$.1k change on btc is literally nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:14:49
Your understanding of limit order is correct. You can indeed lose money that way, but before you start investing you always need a strategy. Make boundaries for yourself, a low and high. You can end up buying at 10k, riding the wave to 30k and then it crashes and you have nothing. Also, those boundaries should be regularly updated. If the value goes up, your lower boundary should go up as well. This subreddit is filled with the HODL (holding btc at all cost) mentality so they won't agree with me on that. 
Don't try to get into 'daytrading' bitcoins yet, like shorting and buying at dips(time where btc's drop in value). It is too volatile  and is a pure gamble if you don't know what you're doing. Think long term but still, set some boundaries where you feel comfortable with.


Coinbase does not have this system, that's why I recommended   it is owned by coinbase and works great. It supports btc, eth and litecoin.  Also, the fees are much lower in gdax.com.

I would puke for 3 weeks straight and cry I didn't short because my hardware wallet is in a safe somewhere where it takes &gt; 3 days before I can get to it (weird bank policy).

DO NOT USE COINBASE TO **BUY** BITCIONS. Hear me out.
If you are new to bitcoin, coinbase is great. It can be used as an exchange and a wallet, BUT, those **fees** are damn high. Ever heard of  It's owned by the same company (coinbase), it's an exchange website with a 0% taker or 0.3% maker fee. It's cheap too buy/sell them. But, one of the main reason you shouldn't use coinbase as a wallet: you have **NO limit order**! If shit starts to crash hard, you can't automatically dump your coins. In You can still use coinbase as a wallet if you don't invest too much and don't mind the risk of not being able to panic dump. But, one more thing: **security**. *Hardware wallet* is still the way to go imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:42:06
If he is going to invest more in bitcoin, sure, give him a hardware wallet. But if he is just going to hodl, why not put the (original amount + price of hardware wallet) on a paper wallet as a gift? The $80  from the hw will be worth substantially more anyways if he is just going to hodl
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:39:23
Price will go up when big companies adopt btc. It'll be an other big surge and a major correction will arrive after everything settles in. Great for daytrading/shorting but just keep holding if you're not sure and you'll be fine.
