Well I mean the Manual told me to buy the 50 dollar coffee...

If this is true then could you give me a source? I'm really not trying to be a troll, I just want something to back up your claim. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:03:33
Everything is awesome
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:33:26
Que es este cue tú hablas o?

What is this witchcraft?
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:59:13
Bitcoin doesn't care if your a crazy dictator either
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:58:04
Que Ron Paul gif 
Edit: si si yo sé.
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:33:28
But remember we can't get cocky. Bitcoin can still fail even in its current crippled state.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:05:21
Except coindesk, they seem pretty professional.
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:18:26
Thanks, that's a really cool idea
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:16:04
This is the problem I have with the Bitcoin community. We cheer on the open source nature of Bitcoin then bash others when they go out and make an altcoin. What satoshi made is great, but there are still flaws, and many altcoins address these problems. Downvote me to hell but this is stupid.
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:14:53
Bitcoin stronk. Community powerful.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:06:29
How was the game, sadly i missed it.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:20:03
I see a few of your points, but I can see a lot of problems being fixed by altcoins. Also, what is your source behind the employment by the state of Maryland may I ask.
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:24:39
As a newish person to Bitcoin could someone explain this to me?
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:06:34
bruh you even do it in the lounge and they kicked you out! FOR CRYING OUT LOUD COME ON
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:23:27
It's like 500 yuan to buy a pizza in china
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:35:11
Seriously. It's like buying a third-world currency honestly.
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:13:14
Do you even know what a bitcoin is? Please tell me you do before rambling on about a "Get rich scheme".

¿Tú habla espanol tambien? FENOMENAL!
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:22:53
Couldn't agree with you more.
@_date: 2014-11-26 03:43:31
True, however their charts are decent
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:09:03
Awww don't ignore doge. Doge just wants to be a friend!

I remember reading somewhere that he said gay marriage is immoral.

What I would love to see is integration in video games where your work in that game earns bitcoins which then you can spend in real life and ingame. VIDEO GAMES BECOME REAL LIFE. Also things would lose value and video games would become much harder. 
For examples, someone could set up a company in elite dangerous. You can be hired by them to run trade runs between different stations and earn a cut of the trade value.

WOOO GARY JOHNSON. Sorry I'm a libertarian.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:52:04

I don't need my own country, I have the beautiful United States of freaking America.

@_date: 2015-04-19 00:32:34
this is possibly the saddest attempt at making a country. ever.
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:42:16
Right, but those are for celebrating different things, not just veterans.
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:34:46
well yeah, a large portion of the worlds population are atheist, it would only make sense.
@_date: 2015-11-16 13:21:31
Thank the lord!
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:20:42
I want to forget 
@_date: 2015-11-12 02:53:34
Are there any other veterans days I'm not aware of?
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:57:32
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:04:00
Woah really? Whats the name of the company?
@_date: 2015-03-16 03:39:39

@_date: 2015-02-15 17:19:45
Cause I don't need no one managing my money.
