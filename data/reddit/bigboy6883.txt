If I understand correctly, that means that *on the long run*, there's no actual benefit for anyone to join a pool ?
@_date: 2011-06-01 16:50:14
Well, here's the thing, it doesn't :-)

Hey ! WHERE ?? Any european shops by chance ?
@_date: 2011-05-07 21:02:20
I sense sarcasm :) That was an honest question though, I didn't know about those transaction fees.

So pools (or mining altogether) are only worth for beefy GPU mining ?
My computer is not constantly powered on, what happens if I power it down in the middle of a block computation ? Doesn't being in a pool help with that ? (I guess I just don't know a lot yet about bitcoin mining !)
Thanks !

anything would work, so get something easy to install.

I've heard from a trusted source that he's one of the main contributors of Bitcoin's code. Now you see why Bitcoin is doomed ! SELL SELL SELL !!! (*prepares to buy...*)

I'm afraid you're completely off here, pal :-) Check more precisely what is exactly the smallest hash problem and you'll get a better hang at it.

So at 11MHashes/s I will take some time heh
I don't have so much of a GPU, my video card is an oldish Radeon X1300 (not much of a gamer !)

I did that at first !
My config : one machine (sort of server) running bitcoind (with the settings you said, don't forget to set the rpcallowip to something like 192.168.1.* depending on your LAN)
Then point the miners on the other machines to that server like it would be a pool server really, with the said username and password.
All set !
Beware though, that it might not give you a lot of horse power anyway, if none of your miners have access to a GPU !
Good luck and have fun !

Btw, as per the other comment thread, why do you pool instead of going solo ?
@_date: 2011-04-15 09:49:20
Thanks for the calculator btw, interesting !
@_date: 2011-04-15 09:39:28
Still worth if triggered by the screensaver, that is using those idle CPU times, right ?
@_date: 2011-04-20 10:02:01
I've got a couple of offers (linux consulting and blogs on own domain installations) but no luck so far !
@_date: 2011-04-20 20:53:28
yeah I was using cpuminer as well. Don't forget to set the number of threads (one for each CPU core for example !) and to pick the algo (for example : sse2_64 or whichever is best for your computer).
I was mostly mining for geek fun as well, but I was a bit depressed by the few mhash/s I was able to get ... so I bought 2 x AMD ATI HD5770 to go further with the experiment (and play a bit with OpenCL on the way !)
All in all, a lot of interesting things to play with !
@_date: 2011-04-18 03:48:25
lol now I'm confused :D Could you give more specifics ? You mean it might be worth joining a pool ?
