So, tell us the way? If you don't mind "teaching it" to others, then just teach us over here.

Lol Sorry expert I know all, looks like you hold the only truth among all huh? As said up here, I already got some back and did cut most of my loses. Didn't make more before because I got too greedy sadly. Panic-Sell is selling everything and getting out, but well, it looks like some of us are born knowing it all right?

Just relax and wait. Only option right now, if you want to stay on the market is ''Buy Low-Sell High''. If you don't have the balls for that, then just cash out and let it stabilize for a couple days before buying back in.

Welcome onboard. Put your seatbelt On and don't get hands out of the bitcoin train. Hope you enjoy the ride

Indeed. Just don't go too greedy :(

Well, after selling at a loss of 13k... It doesn't seem that bad
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:47:57
As the holder of all trues right? If it went down to 1k I don't think you would be saying the same.  ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:16:23
Same. EVERY time I make a transaction it bounces the opposite way I'm expeting it to.. like wtf... I gotta take a Salt Bath or something to get rid of the fucking bad luck
