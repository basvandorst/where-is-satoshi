I want bitcoin to soar up to $500k in 2020 but I also want to see John McAfee eat his own dick

What if I wanted to avoid the fees and do gdax limit purchasing?

How would a large solar flare or EMP attack affect Bitcoin? Or any kind of mass electrical outage for that matter?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:04:19
Actively using Bitcoin would make the price go lower though wouldn't it? Since everyone nowadays is just hodling for gainz
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:45:46
I was going to buy some Bitcoin when it went back down to 13k but didn't realize it takes so long to get money into coinbase/gdax. Should buy a little bit with my credit card and buy more with my bank withdrawal later?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:00:59
Should I use my usd funds in my coinbase account and buy Bitcoin on gdax and then transfer it over to a Gemini account? How long does it take to setup Gemini?

Will lightning give people an incentive to sell their Bitcoin? If this happens the price will go down right?

So many trolls in here

At what point do us hodlers sell?

You bought 75 bitcoins at $6k = $450,000 and 72 more at $13k = $935,000
You are one rich bish
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:58:35
But that's only enough to buy a used lambo
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:19:01
Sorry to burst your bubble but the last place a time traveling billionaire would go is on Reddit/4chan/internet. Also, time travel to the past is only possible to the point that the time machine was turned on. So even if a time machine is in invented tomorrow it won't be able to go back in time

You must have a lot of Bitcoin

Lol I have a full time work from home job that pays well. I am not quitting it to save 15%.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:07:19
My life would be empty of monetary issues if that happened
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:10:04
Gotta buy at some point, why not now
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:11:07
Too many zeros or maybe this guy is living in the future when Bitcoin is 130,000
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:57:25
How do I get out of paying the taxes on the gains?? Send to my friend in Germany and have him send me a lambo?
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:10:35
Lizard people
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:47:31
My goal in life is to not work and just smoke meats and shoot guns all day lol. I will need a large amount of money to make interest/dividends to live off. Still working on that
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:57:21
Thanks, I make more than that though so I believe it's 15% of my lambo funds
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:13:34

16 months ago Bitcoin was around $17000. Hopefully we can see that price soon
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:00:14
Looks like I need a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:27:59
What wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:27:33
Mycelium wallet does that too. I may just stick with that then rather than paper. Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:37:08
What's the advantage of getting a physical wallet over an app like Mycelium?
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:04:29
Is it smarter to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase Pro to a Mycelium Wallet or would piece of paper be safer? Also, I've never transferred anything out of Coinbase and I'm scared I'd screw something up. Also, if you take things out of Coinbase will I need to do anything when the fork comes?
