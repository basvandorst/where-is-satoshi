select "Time based",
then ADD and it works.

I am not sure that Authy works with Bitstamp.net.  I type in 16 codes and it doesn't work.  I don't have the QR code image to scan.  I submit the question to Bitstamp and still wait for the answer.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:33:49
So Authy is compatible with Google Authenticator.  Thanks.

Warren Buffett is wrong.  Bitcoin is the technology not the currency. Don't treat it like gold or currency.  Gold is the commodity. Gold value has been around in the history for 5000 years. Its value will be here for another 5000 years unless the scientist can create the synthetic gold or they can mine gold in the asteroid. US dollar or any other fiat money is backed by the government with debt and tax enforced by the military and police. Bitcoin is the technology. It is like http for the web, smtp protocol for email. The more people use it the more value it is. Two or three people use it then it has little value. Billion people use it then it has the tremendous value. It is the power of network. It likes Facebook or Twitter with billion people using it then it worths multi-billion dollar. Technology comes and goes. The new technology will replace the old technology or make the old technology obsolete. The new better digital currency will replace bitcoin. 
Is bitcoin price in bubble? Compare its market cap at $8 billion with Twitter market cap $30 billion or Facebook market cap at $170 billion.  Investing in bitcoin likes investing in the technology stock. Investing in it right now like you buy Microsoft IPO in 1986 and you sell Microsoft stock at its peak value in 2000. Don't ask Warren Buffett about investing in bitcoin. He never invest in anything that he doesn't understand. Beside he doesn't want to invest in technology stock. He refused to invest in Intel or Microsoft even he had the chance to know the company CEO.  Warren Buffett is the old school guy who only invest in coke (KO), oil (XOM), candy (See Candy), bank (WFC), credit card company (AXP).  Warren Buffett is the investor not the innovator.  The innovator will take risk to invent the new technology to benefit for the society and mankind.  CEO of Motley Fool David Gardner disagrees with Warren Buffett about avoiding to invest in technology stocks.  David said that we live in the technology era so we can not refuse to invest in the technology that we use and get benefit everyday.  Tech CEO are the richest guys in the world like Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg.  Venture Capital (VC) investor like Marc Andreessen invests in a group start up companies and only one of them win that will make him billion of dollar.  Million people makes money by investing in technology stocks like Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, Google.  When you buy a tech stock and it goes up 1000% percent then sell half of it and move money to consumer staples stocks like Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL).  The people lost money in tech stock by buy and hold forever like Warren's preaching.  There are many other cryptocurrency such as Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin. It is like there are many social network websites like Facebook, Google+, Myspace, LinkedIn, Bebo. The one has the most users then it will has the most value in its market cap. All of the cryptocurrencies will coexist. Bitcoin, gold, US dollar, fiat currency will coexist. Each of them is useful for each country, each company or each individual user.

A few weeks ago I transferred 3.0 BTC from Mt.Gox to BTC-E and it succeeded.  This morning I transfer 5.0 BTC from Mt.Gox to CampBX and it confirms.  Later I transfer 6.0 BTC from Mt.Gox to CampBX and it doesn't show anything in blockchain.info.  It looks like if I transfer the even number of bitcoin then it fails.

Yes, you can use dollar cost average to trade bitcoin and get profit in bitcoin not in fiat.  Through the time you will accumulate more bitcoin in your account.  Trader loves volatility.  I wish bitcoin can go back to $1200/BTC because I bought some bitcoins at $1200/BTC price.  $100,000 per bitcoin is too much because the bitcoin programmer can divide the decimal (0.00000001) to infinite.

Bill Gates is the big liar.  Why does he charge so much money for Windows when Linux OS is free?  It makes the computer is more expensive to the consumers.  He uses the US customers' money to launch his philanthropy programs in the third world countries.  How many third world countries' customers buy his overpriced Windows OS?  He uses his cutthroat non-competitive tactic to kill Netscape browser and many other US startup companies.  Nowadays not many people buy overpriced Microsoft Office suite when they get it free from Google Docs.  Karma is coming back.

The tulip bulb crashed only one time and it never came back.  Bitcoin has crashed several times and came back all the times.  The market has tested the bitcoin crashes many times already.  Tulip bulb is a thing like beanie baby.  Bitcoin is the technology.  Compared bitcoin with tulip bulb doesn't make sense.  When the dot com crashed many strong internet companies like Amazon, Ebay, Yahoo, Priceline.com still grow strongly since.  Bitcoin only crashes when another new technology performs better than bitcoin.  I don't see any new digital currency works better than bitcoin yet.

Bitcoin is the technology.  Don't treat it like gold or currency.  Is bitcoin price in bubble?  Compare its market cap at $10 billion with Twitter market cap $30 billion or Facebook market cap at $120 billion.  Gold is the commodity. Gold value has been around in the history for 5000 years. Its value will be here for another 5000 years unless the scientist can create the synthetic gold or they can mine gold in the asteroid. US dollar or any other fiat money is backed by the government with military and police. Bitcoin is the technology. It is like http for the web, smtp protocol for email. The more people use it the more value it is. Two or three people use it then it has little value. Billion people use it then it has the tremendous value. It is the power of network. It likes Facebook or Twitter with billion people using it then it worths multi-billion dollar. Technology comes and goes. The new technology will replace the old technology or make the old technology obsolete. The new better digital currency will replace bitcoin. Investing in bitcoin likes investing in the technology stock. Investing in it right now like you buy Microsoft IPO in 1986 and you sell Microsoft stock at its peak value in 2000. Don't ask Warren Buffett about investing in bitcoin. He never invest in anything that he doesn't understand. Beside he doesn't want to invest in technology stock. He refused to invest in Intel or Microsoft even he had the chance to know the company CEO. There are many other cryptocurrency such as Litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin. It is like there are many social network websites like Facebook, Google+, Myspace, LinkedIn, Bebo. The one has the most users then it will has the most value in its market cap. All of the cryptocurrencies will coexist. Bitcoin, gold, US dollar, fiat currency will coexist. Each of them is useful for each country, each company or each individual user.

His original writing is in Business Insider
He has so many flaws in his writing from a finance professor and a Federal Reserve bank examiner. He talks about bitcoin exchange and never mention the first and largest Mt.Gox exchange in Japan. There are over 20 exchanges in the world.  How's about CampBX and Coinbase in the US, professor?  His silly example about the dinner and restaurateur delays to pay and accept the bill because of bitcoin price drop or increase. The restaurateur or the business owner don't need to takes risk in bitcoin price fluctuation.  They just use Bitpay and convert bitcoin to USD immediately when they receive bitcoin. The dinner has to pay the bill because he/she eats the food. He or she can choose to pay USD if the bitcoin price is dropped. Bitcoin is the technology that can use side by side with fiat currency. He said that more credible retailers saying "No" to Bitcoin while Overstock.com announces willing to accept bitcoin in 2014 and more and more businesses accept bitcoin everyday in Bitpay which is over 12,000 businesses and charities. There are so many other flaws in his writing.  He predicts that bitcoin price in the single digit about $8 or $9 per bitcoin in June or July 2014.  You can bet a couple grant with him that the price of bitcoin doesn't crash under $10 in mid-2014. You will get a chunk of money out from his government salary or school salary from this idiot professor.
