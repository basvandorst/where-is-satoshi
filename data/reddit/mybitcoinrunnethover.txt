This naivety. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:45:09
Fucking lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:37:23
Bitcoin has no place in the world of leftism.  It will only be taught as a negative influence on the world.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:39:31
Yeah man if only there was a way to forcefully take Bitcoin from people to redistribute it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:54:30
Fake news and a clickbaity title gets you upvotes though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:06:23
This community either has a playground level understanding of logical arguments or its so many layers of irony deep that you lost me a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:28:02
They're on their way.  Not that they'll stop bitcoin.  Bitcoin is bigger than state regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:44:42
That anecdotal evidence really showed you. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:37
Only this sub can spin some negative news for Bitcoin into negative news for it's competitors instead.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:01
Where's the part where he takes the side of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:18:13
That's pretty much why you're regulated lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:42:14
As an antifa supporter he should just ask the comissar to have us distribute our wealth to him.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand bitcoin. The beauty is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical economics most of the movements will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Satoshi’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his beliefs- his personal philosophy draws heavily from anarcho-capitalist literature, for instance. The holders understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this market, to realise that they’re not just profitable- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the beauty in bitcoin's existential tagline “Peer to Peer Currency,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.
And yes, by the way, I DO have a bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid

Honestly a positive.  I guess that makes this @_date: 2017-08-18 19:10:21
Its was liberals who told me not to buy cryptocurrencies and because I listened to them I missed out on years of gains. To this day they are still the primary critics of cryptocurrencies to this day.  
If they can't centralize it and control it they don't like it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:43:03
Yes.  Announcement at all-time-high.  After weeks or even months of FUD about Bitfinex.  24 hours after I'm sure they had a chance to close their own positions.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:50:50
Why did you change from "Fuck you" to "It's a joke dude"?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:25:57
B-but muh altruistic Bitmain narrative. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:28:54
Are you saying that someone owns the Bitcoin name?  If so, who?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:15:31
Don't sell your free hedge guys or fall for sensationalist circlejerk threads like this one. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:25:27
You could use Gdax instead of Coinbase.  Run by the same people but with zero fees if you use limits instead of panic market buys/sells.
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:49:27
I think there's something to be said for stating the facts, meaning exactly what you say, and not treading into the realm of fake news by misstating things and expecting the reader to infer what you actually meant.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:20:23
Do you guys know what a hedge is?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:10
I was with you in your first paragraph but then you decided to turn your post into something more political and then you lost me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:58:32
Why would you sell your free hedge?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:18:01
fake news on reddit how could this happen
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:18:07
No one is actually stupid enough to pay that kind of fee right?
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:28:37
Yeah posting this uninformed circlejerk on a monthly basis seems to be the right amount of time for people here to forget its a repost. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:24:30
Yeah surely this time we've destroyed fiat yeah.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:11:42
Bend the knee to the authoritarian regime you say?
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:08:12
There can be no centrists in this war, only the extreme!  If you're not with the narrative, you're against it!
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:45:21
As long as the MSM and liberal institutions disparage crypto (and also bring up some excellent points) the "masses" will never adopt crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:38:35
China most definitely has altruistic motives for their actions in crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:51:46
Mmm thanks for the daily circle jerk.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:25:21
Why would I spend it if I know the price will go up?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:20:39
Post the public address so we can see a deposit to it from 2013 or before and make a withdrawal or you're a larping bullshitter. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:46:23
How do you sue an open source project. Does someone own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:06:07
North Korea. Good company we keep.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:09:57
Why don't you have any?
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:31:25
Is this bitcoin news?
"Indirectly, you could argue and say governments, regulators and central bankers may have contributed to the wealth creation," Josef Stadler, global head of ultra-high net worth at UBS, told CNBC on Thursday.
So bitcoin's effect is minimal.  Thanks for the fake news courtesy of CNBC
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:20:18
Solid reason to unsub from this place right here. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:30:18
Nice are you going to repost this every time?  Real fucking neato.
