Comes the same day my fist coinbase purchase was deposited, awesome!
@_date: 2013-09-08 03:10:16
I feel the same way my brother, i took my first 1 dollar tip and now have 7 litecoins on btc-e from it (hedging between the ltc/btc exchange rate) i just opened coinbase and set up recurring $25 purchases a month. I feel like this is wealth  worth holding; whereas i have no problem blowing that same amount of fiat at dinner. To make a long story short, i never believed in saving or investing until my first btc tip. P.s. pass the favor along to another. The act of blindly throwing money to a random stranger has a profound effect.

Came here to say write that shit down. Seriously though, its not like you are trading your bitcoins through silkroad or something. The USgov has yet to take a negative stance on crypto-trading; hence, you should have no fear in keeping an organized journal and ledger of your transactions, including your emotions at time of purchase/sale

apparently you don't understand the work that some of these top notch dev's have put into jailbreaks. A jailbroken wallet app could potentially be more secure than one through the appstore
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:02:40
you can change the 32 bit bitcoin protocol to a 64bit version and further divide by another 8 decimal places if i am correct, it may be time consuming but.... if bitcoin reaches this scarcity; it may very well be worth the dev's time to fix it... hence, it would be fixed, and divided further

ahh... the countries i am trying so hard to emigrate to... to free myself from the oppressive u.s. regime i currently am held by. My only hope to emigrate out of the UNITED.SHITSTAIN.of.ASSHOLE lies in the ever flowering crypotocurrencies our fellow redditor's are trying so hard to establish as a global currency and balance-r of human rights/equality (fyi, i currently OWE soooooooooo much in health care bills due to our fuckkkkked up health care system. I live in the most prominent country in the world but owe 5k+ for a collarbone surgery, and `11k for facial reconstuction incurred during a violient assault.....?" Imagine paying that off working minimum wage and paying for a state univ; out of pocket too!.. to avoid the financial aid system and the dark black hole that haunts anyone silly enough to fall in.............
EDIT: not a sob story; just the sad financial truth of so many people born after 1990; times will change... mark my word

The annonimity that bitcoin provides to me is worth it's weight in bitcoin, ill leave only if a better crytocurrency comes around or if bitcoin is outlawed because of illegal content in the blockchain. That being said, i think it will be unlikely that a better one comes around before bitcoin has captured a very large user base that will be hard to turn as a whole (first mover advantage ftw)

your a.v. software is unlikely to pick up on malware specifically designed to empty wallets, its not in their hierarchical nature to pick this sort of malware up considering the the user base of bitcoin/regular internet use. That being said, i'm guessing someone mined their brain wallet

@_date: 2013-11-04 06:30:38
The real question I have is how instantaneous the transaction is for a new customer. I was verified level one on october 15. The visa back up was set up as an option after i had completed lvl 1 and I made my first purchase (30 day delay after 1st purchase). I was flagged as a high risk customer after my 1st and second purchase. I was white-listed by on my third purchase which was successful. Has anyone that has verified lvl1 and visa linked been able to insta-purchase though? that perhaps is my real question. 
edit: my 3rd purchase was made before visa link as well

I've been having these kind of conversations with the regulars coming through the gas station. Even gave the owner of the store 0.1 BTC's back when we dipped below 100. He is so excited that his $10 is holding its value so well (its above 30 now!). Anyways he said he is fine with me selling localbitcoins at our store and is even considering allowing purchases at our gas station in BTC. Looking into the coinkite stuff and getting very excited

I have nothing but high hopes for localbitcoins, u guys rock... Now just make 2-factor mandatory... :)

exactly, most dice players only show up 2-4 a month at most and thats if they believe in the btc protocol as apposed to speculating and cutting their losses/wins when they win/loose 
edit: lose, loose is your mom
