It’s not really debatable, it’s not centralized just cause it’s the same country.

What should I do with my Coinbase BTC 888 sats deposit ? Thinking of buying and selling to get rid of the Utxo or any suggestions ? I don’t use CB to buy BtC just to sell for USD ..

Same country doesnt mean centralized control

It will rise and rise until It Is DEMANDED as payment, then it will be spent slowly. It will rise and rise as a true Money should. The savers will once again be rewarded like when Gold was the primary money.

There is massive paper gold out there and paper silver for that matter. Take possession or all u have is paper.

@_date: 2018-11-14 13:02:53
Foreshadowing I think, sometimes crazy stuff happens on the low then spreads

Most Ron Paul’s loyal followers are or were Gold Bugs al well, I’ve been following the Paul’s since 2000 when he was against Bush in the primaries.  Back then the Bitcoin of the day was The Liberty Dollar pioneered by Bernard VonNauthus from the Hawaiian Royal Mint. Gold &amp; Silver Backed paper bills with different colors and sizes for the blind and redeemable for actual pure silver &amp; gold. NORFED &amp; Liberty Dollar had about $10 million in circulation , when the FBI raided and stole everything and charged him with counter fitting. Bitcoin was the follow up solution , since clearly the Feds wouldn’t allow a traditional Gold Standard any longer.

Omg Bitcoin market penetration is minute, once the big and smart money is positioned get ready to see a 24hr news cycle on crypto

I was half asleep yes of course I’d need a node duh ����, in either case, Cash App is faster than Coinbase for moving Bitcoin to wallet or exchange or payments in my experience thus far...
@_date: 2019-01-20 08:43:06
Well I’m guessing people will take either Bitcoin dollar or combo of the both as a option for changing the change, if it’s less fee to convert to BTC then we may have a lil winner there
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:28:55
They should withdraw through BTC/LTC 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:26:23
