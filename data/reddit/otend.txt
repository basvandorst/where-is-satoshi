If that happens and the deflationary mechanism stops being an impedence, then it'll be a nice currency to have on hand.  The problem is, I'm not sure how to sidestep these issues in such a way that would be practical.

The problem is, it won't go away with time.  The currency, by design, unintentionally encourages speculation.  A stable value cannot exist when there's nothing to cancel out mass speculation.

Please don't push an unsubstantiated conspiracy and blame it for the fall of a currency.  If you aren't willing to acknowledge that Mt. Gox is a pack of incompetent retards and that a crash was inevitable given the massive rate of deflation, seek help, because you may be in serious denial.

I don't see it thickening as a result of the aforementioned short-term problems constantly worsening the conditions of the currency.  On top of that, the built-in deflationary mechanism will be a long-term problem and possibly make the volatility worse, assuming that the currency doesn't entirely go out of use.  There is no good reason for a built-in deflationary mechanism; a means of slowing down inflation, sure, but building deflation into a currency is going to lead to nothing but shit in the future.  Stable, widely-used currencies have slight, consistent inflation for a very, very good reason.

It may not be directly monitored, but it sure as hell means real decrease of value.  You're cashing out, indicating a lack of confidence in the currency.  If many people do this, the entire point of this is moot, as there will still be mass selloffs and massive decreases in value.  You're basically deceiving everyone and you know it.

Yes, because everything with control can be compared to a prison to make the person saying control isn't bad look like a horrible person!
Seriously, in the context of a currency, control's more than fine if it means some semblance of stability.

We never said they didn't happen.  Even if we did, that doesn't make conspiratorial arguments any less dumb.

The problem is this: the currency has a built-in deflation mechanism, which means that the knife would essentially constantly tell you IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STAB THIS PERSON BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE MONEY FOR YOU.  This, in combination with the decentralization giving it a highly volatile value, leads to speculation as far as the eye can see, until its bitter end.

They're equally shitty and have their own deflationary mechanism, making them untenable as currency.  I think gold's a fair comparison, except gold has some actual use.

IT MUST BE A CONSPIRACY!  THERE'S NO CHANCE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT!
No, people recognized that the housing crisis would happen.  It's just that nobody listened.

Yes, let's take it from somehow inherently corrupt governments and give it to the whims of mankind!  We don't have to think about mass deflation or volatility, or the fact that the currency's basically the new gold standard, we can just talk about how great our currency is because the government's not involved!

The fact that we need options to protect us from the risk of currency volatility should in itself be an indication that we have a terrible currency on our hands.  The exchange of money should not hold the level of risk necessary for these services to spawn.

Five or ten dollars, give or take.

Dude, the currency is fluctuating and will keep fluctuating.  Our power to affect the worth of the currency is the very thing that gives it crippling volatility, encouraging speculation, deflation, and hoarding over all else.  There's nothing to believe in but the self-serving nature of mankind, and if that's what Bitcoin is, I believe in it, and that's not a good thing.

Okay, you may have a point there.  Still, the "smart people" mentioned before were the few people warning of it; Krugman, for instance, called it back in 2005.
I'm sort of convinced that the people who helped bring about the crisis were either oblivious to the warnings of the massive risks being taken or wanted to make a profit and get out.

Organic fallacy.  Please tell me you recognize your own bad logic.

QE devaulation is a small price to pay for a currency that has roughly the same value one day as it does the next.  I'd like to be sure that my living wage could afford the same things consistently.

Control's not a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:08:33
Who the hell would accept a currency with such a variable real value as a payment method other than mad people?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:12:49
Something along those lines; simply put, the value that people assign to it.  There are plenty of issues with the idea of trying to primarily use a currency that could cause items to be seriously overpriced one day and seriously underpriced the next.
