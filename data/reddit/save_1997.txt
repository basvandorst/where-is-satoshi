Well, that was very subtle.

Excuse me, why do you thing so?
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:28:14
Are you sure that it's based on hype index? I mean datalight describes their own research here, not using of h.i.

Huh, they imposed restrictions on icos only, crypto is still very popular here, as everywhere. I mean, companies are ready to pay a lot to be promoted here

Hi! The lab looks pretty well but I haven't gotten over it - too many things
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:45:31
I'm confident that there're many users who have already tested the lab as well as datalight isn't a simple shit platform, I guess

Analysis field is not so huge, so, I believe there'll be whole dramatic confrontation among 4 players

And it'll drive USD out soon, you'll see

Cryptocompare, Coinmarketcap, Tradingview and actual Datalight. Do you know other ones? 
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:20:18
Do you know when they're going to launch an exchange? I mean, I haven't found anything in their telegram group and website. Could somebody help me?
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:39:18
Well, binance may be an the most visited, but I prefer to use bittrex for daily trading

Sorry? Are you sure they're going to give signals or insights?? As far as I know datalight is a simple analysis platform, that's all. And the lab is like your personal account, isn't it?
