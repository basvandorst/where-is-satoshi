Realistically you should diversify so that all your eggs aren’t in the risky bitcoin basket. Maybe alternate weeks investing in index funds or similar more traditional investments and then the next week invest half and half into bitcoin and litecoin (or all in on one or the other). If you’re willing to invest and hold longterm rather than just hoping to get rich quick, I would definitely start with an IRA (if you’re from the US). 
An IRA is a tax advantaged retirement account with a max contribution limit of $5,500 a year (if you’re under 50 [or somewhere around that age], which I’m assuming you are). It would be something you set up through Vanguard (or a similar service). This is for index funds, stocks, bonds etc. to slowly grow throughout your life as you continue to contribute so that when you’re ready to retire, you hopefully have enough to live on. 
You can’t withdraw from it before a certain age without incurring penalties except for a first time home purchase. The tax advantage is that (depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA or a roth IRA) you don’t pay taxes on what you put in but pay taxes on the withdrawal (the former, and typically the one most recommended I believe) vs. paying taxes when you invest it but not when you withdraw it (the latter, and what I personally use). 
In an ideal investment scenario, you’ll invest in a wide variety of investment vehicles like stocks, bonds, index funds, bitcoin (if you so choose) etc. So that your risk isn’t as high (having all your eggs in one basket where if it tanks, you potentially lose everything). What percentage goes in each is dependent on your own risk tolerance. I’d say it goes (from riskiest to least risky) Bitcoin &gt; Stocks &gt; Index funds &gt; Bonds (and there are a host of other options as well). 
The issue with putting all of your money into bitcoin is that it is extremely risky and no one knows what it will do. But the other three are unlikely to net you the gains that bitcoin will. Typically index funds are the best option as pretty much no one (not even career investors) can reliably beat the market. Bonds are pretty much (and someone please correct me if I’m wrong) for maintaining value, not really any actual growth (basically beating out inflation). Index funds are much safer than individual stocks or bitcoin but offer less potential gains. Stocks are difficult to pick correctly (how do you know you’re investing in the next Apple vs. the next Snapchat?). Obviously by doing your due diligence (research and checking out financials, history etc. of each potential investment), you’ll be a hell of a lot closer to the mark but like I said, even professionals have trouble consistently beating index funds. 
That’s a short answer that is hopefully a decent primer for you. No one can tell you what you should do or what is best for your situation. I personally invest in bitcoin, litecoin, index funds and individually picked stocks but we don’t know your situation and even if we did, we can’t make that call for you.

Because you’re saying they do all those things terribly in regards to you not paying taxes. If you think they do them terribly and that you shouldn’t have to pay, then you don’t use them. If you use them, you should pay.

Yupp. Its better to do $100 a month than $1200 at the end of the year.

This was in reference to people not paying their taxes, and then your comment which came across as justification for not paying taxes, as the original commenter said. Not not wanting to pay taxes.

So I guess you live on a compound, don’t use public roads or utilities, have a militia to defend yourself etc.?

Which was in a chain talking about not paying taxes and therefore came across as justification in not paying your taxes

People have been stealing from bitcoin related sites/markets without being found out for years.

Well, I don't have a habit (been chipping IV use for 4 years) but I had quit smoking/didn't smoke at all the last time I had a dope binge. Not quite the same but probably as close as you'll get

Same. Used to look at it back when it was ~$13 (looking at using original Silk Road) and then started using it at $100. Heartbreaking.

Nah, you gotta balance it out. Try tossing in a little coke. Totally cancels out the other two. I promise.
