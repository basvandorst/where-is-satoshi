You assume technology won't advance. Think of the computing power of an iphone and how much power that would have required even 10 years ago.
We're seeing that technology now in ASIC miners. 800 watts to power 240+ processors.
edit - example 800 watts/110V 10 years ago to 1400mAh and 3.7 volts. We've advanced.

The proposed Seg2x hardfork is what was affected..and failed. Bitcoins' Legacy blockchain wasn't in danger.
but think of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested into renting miners and nodes and infrastructure to get a new hardfork running. Then having it freeze and fail..The losses are the real catastrophe. 
This is a definite lesson. Scams in crypto currencies are real.

Short Answer: Yes.
Once you guy the correct (ASIC) hardware the ROI is about 4-6 months based on coin prices. And not only can you mine BTC...
But every other coin in the SHA-256 algorithm on the fly. (and there are other coins on other hardwares/algorithms.) theres a lot to it.
BUT Electricity costs $$ if yer in Calif. paying 0.23$ per kwh you will mine at a possibe loss.
