With hex die you should only roll 32 times.
Don't enter it into the brain wallet area, that's not how it works. After downloading bitaddress.org and going offline you need to enter in your 32 hex rolls under the "wallet details" tab.

Awesome, glad you have it watch-only, no need to give a 3rd party your private keys. If you want to spend those coins incase of emergency as you are asking, you will need to use the private key.
Your paper wallets include the private key which can be imported to any wallet service, electrum, bitcoin core, mycellium, multibit, coinbase, etc

Here's the big thing most people are not thinking about.
Any other cloud mining you pay a fee for a certain amount of time for hashing power. That money is gone, you are not getting it back.
With VOS Divcoin, you pay for your coins, collect the daily dividends until you are done, bored, need the money etc and then you can sell your coins to someone else. In essence the fee you are paying for the hash power is just a refundable deposit, assuming you sell your coins to a buyer for the same price you initially paid.
So I buy $200 worth of coins, collect 1/2 percent daily ($1) in returns and then I sell my $200 worth of coins, and I collected 1/2 percent daily in the process. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:21:47
why? It's essentially a free mining contract. I send them btc, I receive profits and when I done I can cash my coins out and receive back my initial investment

Shady? Why does everyone call BTC-e shady? Offering cloud hashing is shady (bitfinex). Letting people trade and deposit and then ask them for piles of paperwork to withdraw is shady (bitstamp). BTC-e is anonymous and you don't like that. Mt Gox was not anonymous and that didn't stop Karpeles from stealing/losing everyone's coins.  Isn't the entire premise of Bitcoin anonymity and so people punish BTC-e for encompassing the spirit of Bitcoin?  Doesn't make any sense. I trust BTC-e.

Well Mr Ninja it seems like you are quite worried about keeping your identity safe, which I would expect from a good ninja. 
Yes you can buy throwing stars online and your wallet is mostly anonymous. However if you want to receive these ninja items you'll have to deliver them somewhere so there goes your anonymity. But lets say you want to buy something digital like a plugin for digital ninja stars for Ninja Gaiden, well then that would be anonymous. 
Also your ninja lair will remain safe, your IP is NOT connected to your wallet address. You can create an address entirely offline and then go straight to paper wallet. That way your wallet has never seen the internet and will have no connection to your IP. 
Good luck ninja son

Well they've been "getting in position" for quite a while now. I suspect they've been not been buying from an exchange at all. Perhaps have an agreement with a couple large mining farms? They are all a bunch of bankers and they are essentially a bank.

There are only ~13 million coins right now, so you are in fact richer than you claim. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:17:01
That's not the purpose of bitcoin.  If it were, it would be superfluous and pointless to use it.  Bitcoin is cash for the internet, not a middle man for buying pizza. 
With bitcoin you can transfer monetary value in an instant. Let's say you are in New York and your brother/sister/mother needs money in Florida. You can instantly send them money with a small 0.0001 (4 cents) fee. You can't do that with a bank or USD. 
There's also those that buy to speculate that it will be very valuable in the future due to it's limited quantity. You can't just print more like Bernanke does with the USD. There will only ever be 21 million coins and no more. We are only at ~13 million now.

Congrats! Don't get all freaked out unless your the type of person that gets viruses on an unsecure machine. Actually that statement isn't all that true, I have a secure computer and I use paper wallets. Just use bitaddress.org and pull up some videos on youtube under "paper wallets". One guy goes over creating "sloppy wallets" which is a good introduction, your first few papers should only have $1 on them or so until you get used to it. That way if you mess up you won't be bummed you lost a $1 compared to an entire bitcoin.

That's fine to let someone know. I am more talking about the ones that try to push it on others.  
Think of these two situations. 
1) You see someone walk into a computer/tech store, they take out their phone, scan a QR code, the cashier says "thanks for your payment" and they walk out with the item.
2) Someone walks up to you and says "have you heard of ____ ?" " ____ is great, you should really use it". "Look at these 100 reasons I wrote why you should use ____".  "Are you using ___ yet? I told you about a month ago."
Which scenario would you be more interested in learning more?  If someone tries to sell me something, I instinctively back away from it. I read an article about bitcoin which is why I got interested. It wasn't because someone told me or asked me to use it.

1 miners will continue to get paid with transaction fees. Right now they get block rewards and transaction fees. In a hundred years they will just the transaction fees.
2 they can buy a large amount, but banks can only buy the coins that are for sale. with 7 million wallets the existing bitcoins are already well dispersed from this type of attack. Banks would benefit more from buying large amounts and doing what they do but add bitcoins to their services.

I liked the concept and idea. Pretty cool. What prevents someone from running away with the money and not paying out later?  My personal preference is I don't like the dark UI's. Maybe it's just me but they don't seem to fit in the business/finance sector as well, but that could just be me. 
I would probably to an invest in the future when you go live to test it out.

If you're thinking wordpress, you really should avoid trying to create a site like this. You'll get hacked and lose everything in less than a day. 
Bitcoin sites attract a paricular crowd. A crowd that is far more advanced than typical users. I created a website, it was all coded by hand myself. I received two major attacks within the first few hours and one of them was a successful breach but luckily I lost no coins. 
You need to run bicoind and use rpc to add the send and receive functionality. You don't have to use python. You can use PHP or Ruby...

let me tell you this sonny. There is no guaranteed strategy to win on primedice. You may find one that works for a while but if you keep playing you'll eventually bust. 
Here are some fun strategies to try:
7% win chance, double bet after every 5 losses.
9% win chance, increase bet by 11% after each loss.
98% win chance, bet 1/1000th of your balance, on loss increase your bet to recover loss

You can't travel back in time, ever.
Grandfather Paradox :
Time travel is impossible as exemplified by the famous grandfather paradox. Imagine you build a time machine. It is possible for you to travel back in time, meet your grandfather before he produces any children (i.e. your father/mother) and kill him. Thus, you would not have been born and the time machine would not have been built, a paradox.

I think they will retain their value, they'll be adding hash power as the difficulty increases. I just paid a one time fee for mining services. I think once more people realize this value of the coin could even increase.

This is the thought process that initially got me to buy BTC last year. I heard of bitcoin for a while but never looked into it.

1) The project is closed as "not funded" and your investment is returned.
2) Not sure, are you asking as a borrower? If you don't have the coins on payday you will show past due on your obligation.
3) I've funded around 15 projects. I made money on everyone except for one that the borrower didn't pay. I lend out money for a living, so it was fun to do it with my own money. Just invest small amounts into many projects so you are diversified, that way if someone defaults you don't lose everything.

I appreciate your opinion and rational argument; however, a market tends to react similarly in similar situations. I'm not saying Jim bought gold last Tuesday so he must buy gold this Tuesday. I'm saying Jim bought gold last time it was on sale and he will do the same thing again. Bitcoin is still a hot commodity, and it's on sale right now. Bitcoin hasn't lost any of the attributes it had when it was $1K, and people will buy in again now that the price is dropping.

Why not create an additional tasker to help the miners? Increase the blocksize and instead of just having a miner also have a verifier or something that spends the 20+ seconds verifying the previous transaction so that the miner can focus on solving the next block? Wouldn't this help it stay decentralized but prevent miners from "stuffing" blocks so that slows down other miners?

I think this is a great point. When I first got interested in wanting to buy bitcoin I saw the price around $700 in december and I was like I'm not going to risk that much! But I was fascinated by the tech and kept looking into it. It seriously took me a day of research before I realized you could buy fractions of a coin. Once I realized that I bought my first $20 worth on Christmas day which is the other great thing about BTC, the markets never close.

Well the blocks must be sequential. The issue is the timestamp from the miner. The node that mined that block had a wrong time set, thus it signed the block with the wrong time and transmitted it through the network as being solved out of order.

This is how you create weak hands. Unless $50k is pocket change, which I highly doubt, he will be sweating every night when the price drops. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Not sure why he decided to share his purchase either, trying to show off? Or more likely he is already emotional with his purchase and is seeking validation that he made the right move. I hope it works out for you, but these sort of big buys at once are risky and depending on your financial situation, irresponsible.

Where are all these additional transactions going to come from?
Increasing the limit doesn't mean blocks will actually be 20MB unless the volume is there.
In the last 2 years the number of transactions per day have just a little over doubled. ( The number of transactions would have to go up 20x to see 7TB per year. I run a node and I am not concerned what so ever about the block size increase. If transaction volume went up 20x to reach the 7TB a year then bitcoin and the blockchain would have to be a adopted almost worldwide, and that's not a bad thing ;)

You can offer services online, and accept BTC as payment.
You can work up a reputation on bitciontalk and then get paid for your signature space..
You can try to find a bitcoin faucet, but these are mostly a waste of time, you'll earn a half a penny for a weeks worth of solving captchas.

Roll a 6 sided die 99 times. 
Write down what comes up, except replace all rolls that come up as 6 as 0. 
You will then have 99 random numbers 0-5
    01413024021402535420324010340240213454032...
That is your base6 private key. Go on github and download bitaddress.org website. 
 Install it on an offline computer and run the index.html.  Click on the "Wallet Details" tab and enter in those 99 digits you rolled. It will then provide you with your WIF private key and bitcoin address. 
When you are ready to spend from your dice address, just import your WIF private key that bitaddress gave you to any wallet service and you will be able to spend.
Good luck! 
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:51:28
Agreed, buy X amount every so often is the best approach. People that drop their life savings into BTC with one buy become very sensitive to price changes and making emotional decisions. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:14:09
I think it's important to note that running a full node verifies the transactions. A miner packages up the transactions into blocks. If the miner is also running a full node (solo mining) they are also verifying transactions. If they are pool-mining the pool's nodes will verify transactions and the working miners just hash away and are not verifying any transactions. Most miners are pool miners.

Sorry I'm having trouble following your post, but I think you are asking about listunspent? Are you using bitcoind and RPC or using a 3rd party API?  
It can be as simple as a GET request: 
This would list all the unspent_outputs seperatley so just create a loop for each in the array and total up the "amount" fields.

Circle isn't looking to be a payment processor, but rather consumer based financial product.

There's also way more than 3, as your misleading original comment suggested. Miners hash away to compete to discover the nonce and collect the miners reward. The security of the network is supported by copies of the blockchain that are held by nodes, which there are over 5,000 and spread across the entire planet. Bitcoin is plenty secure.

Steady as she goes. I personally think it is better to set aside a certain amount every month and buy no matter what the price is. You'll average out your overall buy in price, not have to worry about buying at the top or bottom and you'll still accumulate a good amount of coins if you are in it for the long term. Either way, it's just a personal opinion there is no wrong or right way to do it, I wish you good luck, and I'll see you on the moon ;)

You are not transporting money on your phone, you're simply holding the keys that control specific outputs. It's no different than if you crossed a border carrying a key to a safety deposit box that holds a million dollars. The money isn't be transported. The only difference is that bitcoin is borderless and those keys can access the funds no matter where you are in the world as long as you have an internet connection. 
Bitcoin breaks the shackles of oppressive governments and the rules for their slaves that they control with their fiat debt system. Your money, is your money and it's none of their business.

As does the bitcoin. The bitcoin doesn't move, the data for the actual "bitcoins" is on the blockchain which nobody will ever have on their phone. Even on the blockchain there are no "bitcoin files" it's just a ledger that keeps track of inputs and outputs. So when you "transport bitcoin" across borders on your phone you are only transporting the keys and not the actual bitcoin. A safety deposit box only exists in one location, but bitcoin exists... everywhere. 
Think about it like email. When you travel do you download all your emails to a folder so you can take your email with you? No, you simply have the keys/passwords that allow you to access your email no matter where you are. The email data never moves, the whole time it's held on a server. 
It's a bit tricky with non-physical items. Technically it's impossible to transport something that doesn't exist in the physical world.

The receive payments API has been delayed for about 4-5 months now. It used to be nearly instant payment forwarding with the callback. Now it takes a while... a long while sometimes nearly 24 hours! Checkout block.io as an alternative. They have a payment forwarder but it's in beta.

On a serious note, I agree with your basic premise that companies in the bitcoin-sphere have terribly unoriginal names. Give me a name without coin, bit, chain or block and I'd be impressed.  I think buttercoin was the worst of them all, especially when they were trying to be a serious company.
