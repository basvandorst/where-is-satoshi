Of course I want to manage my own bitcoin! That's the whole point. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:50:37
Don't forget about roulette!
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:18:43
I would take that $10 free BTC. Put it in my wallet (hold it). And pay in cash! ...wouldn't want to find out 3 years later that Bud was giving out $10,000 beers.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:27:47
Nobody's ever tipped me 😭
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:43:31
Ill do it for free. Message me.

Plan : get Chipotle to accept BTC and actually "get lunch" on behalf of . Thanks again btw - nobody's ever tipped me that much. I woke up this morning and was really surprised.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:03:38
Absolutely! Will do.

I'm pretty sure my GF made one of the very last transactions. Seconds before getting this notice.

Or open up his swag MacBook Air, open up electrum real fast and close it real fast. That's how I would do it anyway.
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:18:55
I agree 100%

What I would like to know, is how much would it cost to send this amount of money a conventional way (bank transfer, etc...).
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:07:02
Gotta start somewhere ;)

If you are using a deterministic wallet and you secure your seed securely in several cold storage locations - then yes you could loose all your keys (both public and private) and still recompile them using your seed.

Lol at leaving 700+ coin in an online vault.

I 100% support this! and thanks for the random act of kindness! Ill pass it along.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:39:16
How much was it?
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:02:48
Wow thanks! I'm $540,000 richer.

Tipping thread?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:25:32
Should I be worried at all about my Electrum wallet? Electrum is secure correct? I have the seed in cold storage and only access my watch only wallet online. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 21:08:10
They're published online

In the last Joe Rogan podcast they were talking about this. Joe writes an e-mail to his buddy who works for reddit. I wonder if this had anything to do with the mod loosing his/her mod status. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:23:36
I bought at 720 down to 400. Just recently broke even. $27+ should be enough for a new pair of space pants, right? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:22:05
Cool thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:27:51
Lol. Thanks for the bits! Much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:59:16
The apple store sells a lot of other things aside from the iPhone. But yes, lol in regards to Apples stance to BTC, this was the wrong place to post. If anybody is interested though, I will take $90 if you pay upfront so I can avoid having to deal with PayPal and eBay. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:05:26

Thanks so much! I'm still trying to wrap my mind around this mBTC thing.
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:59:59
I was thinking about writing a letter to their corporate office(s) and possibly sending out several. They might actually be open to the idea. Chipotle seems to lean in the direction of hip, new, and cool.

For Netflix, no. They should be accepting BTC soon though (est. by June). Like I said before though, I can send you any movie you want free of charge or hook you up with an IPT invite where you can download any movie, TV show, game, app, etc... for free. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:34:08
Ok. I will hold off. Thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:30:40
I do have the seed backed up. I'm just stressed because this has never happened before.
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:27:57
Message me and I'll send you any movie you want. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 18:27:34
Just thought id share my positive experience using BTC to buy a plain ticket. Sorry if this is the "wrong" place for that.

I wish I could accept BTC for my eBay items. I like earthmoonsun's work around though. I'm going to add that to my description. I'd rather not pay fees to PayPal.

I'm out of the red too! +$27! finally. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:47:29

Would you mind if I use your flyer? I will do it entirely non-profit and via e-mail, Skype, in person, etc... 
If not. That's ok I will make my own.
 And ps. this is an awesome idea!

So I can send $1M for $15-25 domestically?
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:11:30
That's what I thought since it says nothing on their website about additional options. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:14:09
I'm all for "bits"!

I'm at a total of 12 right now. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:56:49
Sometimes they give you $5 but that's if the referral makes a buy/sale of $100 or more. All in all, its not about the $5... it's about getting people to set up their first wallet and get their toes wet. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:25:28
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:09:47

Yeah I've had my account linked to CB for over 6 months and I still cannot make instant purchases. I buy small amounts all the time and have to wait 4-days to get my coin. What gives!?
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:26:23
Oh we'll get them interested. How could you not be interested...!
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:49:40
Eh I tend to live paycheck to paycheck. I'm just lucky I have some savings.

....anddd the price drops. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:02:08
Yes in the picture though it shows 700 BTC in the vault. Why not just create a paper wallet or several?
Edit: Coinbase should implement an easy to create paper wallet application 
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:36:44
I also have several IPT invites available. No charge. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 12:38:03
The solution is to use a deterministic wallet and write down your seed in several places 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:33:37
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:13:28
Yes. I was wondering about this. Made a comment and 5-10 second later - 0. 
Edit: what gives?
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:22:18
Thanks! He's been at it on and off for at least a few years. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:22:45
Haha, that's exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:20:37
I'm still very confused by the whole mBit, uBit, and just plain "bits". It might take me a few hours and some reading to wrap my mind around it. The community seems to be moving in the direction of bits - which I find a bit less confusing (no pun intended, lol).
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:44:03
When it hit $590 that was very exciting! My crystal ball says $600-620 tonight.

As a poor college student I must admit this is pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 14:05:25

@_date: 2014-05-10 22:12:31
Thank you so much! :)
@_date: 2014-04-13 05:55:53
I recommend using electrum. Create a wallet and seed. Write your seed down on paper / print it out - this can be used to recover your wallet. Then transfer your coins to your new wallet. Export the electrum wallet to an external hard drive and encrypt the file (again because its already encrypted) using Truecrypt for an extra level of security. After you have multiple copies of these on about 4-5 USB hard drives, delete all files off your computer (your wallet, your seed, private keys, etc). I then recommend making what's called a watch only wallet in electrum which will allow you to watch but not transfer funds out of your cold storage wallet. This way you can keep an eye on things securely. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:43:02
What if you lost your debit card or it was stolen? Or one of the hundreds of other reasons you would need to go to the actual bank. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 15:12:09
I somewhat disagree. I don't care if my coffee is in bits or BTC as long as the dollar amount that I'm paying is fair. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:14:20
No.

I thought the whole idea was to be your own bank. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:00:15
Explain what "cloning" a bank card is please. I thought you meant ordering a new card in the event that you loose your card. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:02:56
How many lights are flashing? 
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:53:09
Alternatively. You could buy a Target gift card from Gyft.com and then use that to buy a Netflix gift card from Target. I know it's kind of weird but it works!
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:26:19
Yes $10 is enough for at least 1 meal, maybe 2.

So when institutional investing goes into full swing - we should see a huge rise in price, yes?
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:40:29
What is this?
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:11:53
Why? That's be really weird and unnecessary. They should just take Bitcoin payments. No change necessary, just reform and adoption. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:32:00
Same here. I can't give out too much. But that's not what counts. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:03:45
The eBay news is huge! Possible PP integration soon. Also the murmurs about the US POSTAL service looking into Bitcoin technology is huge!!!

@_date: 2014-05-14 18:15:59
You can't clone your card if the bank isn't open. I don't have to wait for Bitcoin to be open to use my seed to recreate my deterministic wallet.
Edit: and when you do "clone" or request a new card - many banks make you wait several days for it to come via snail mail. My bank right now doesn't even issue temporary cards - so if you loose it on the weekend or during a holiday you're screwed.

I bought them at $100/coin and 1 day later they're at approx $109. Def. happy with my investment so far. All aboard the bitcoin roller coaster.
