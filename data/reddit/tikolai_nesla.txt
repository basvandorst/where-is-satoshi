To begin there are 4 different kinds of wallet for bitcoin. 
-**Independent** (Bitcoin Core)
-**3rd Party** (Coinbase, Xapo)
-**MultiUser** (CoPay)
-**Physical / Paper** (Trezor / Ledger)
If you are holding large amounts of bitcoin I would consider investing in a **physical wallet** . If you are managing small volumes, send your coins to an **independent wallet** where you personally control the private key to your address.

1 bitcoin is currently $900 USD. So if you have 0.5-2+ I would consider investing into something like a cold(offline) physical wallet. The most popular currently are:
Ledger Wallet

Bitcoin is like a public ledger; anyone can know your balance as long as they have the wallet address. To  **access** funds within that wallet address you must possess the encrypted private key.

There are sadly few ways to purchase due to banking regulations. 
1. You may purchase from an online broker such as Coinbase, Coinmama ; or take a risk and purchase from trusted Ebay sellers. 
2. In person meetups such as Localbitcoin/ OfferUp (Unfortunately seller determines price)

Trusted Ebay sellers if all else fails.
