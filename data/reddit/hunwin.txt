I beg to disagree.
I'm a small business owner in rural NH and I have a "Bitcoin accepted here" on the back of my clipboard. I get asked about it a lot. I'd say 70% of my clients ask about it (thinking bitcoin is whatever villain the media has made it out to be) and then, once I'm done explaining it, about 40% of those ask for me to help them get started with bitcoin. The problem isn't that people don't care. The problem isn't that people are complacent with the status quo. The real problem here is that bitcoin is, just as you described, vilified as a "scam or some kind of failed internet money". What we need in this scenario are for those early adopters (and despite what it may seem, when the song is sung all of us here now will be "early" adopters) to start explaining it to people one-on-one. We need to override the rhetoric about bitcoin. 
Change takes time. Change as big as bitcoin may take a generation. The systems of fiat currency go back over one thousand years, and our banking systems (in their current form) go back almost 300 years. History shows that most technologies start truly entering the mainstream when they've been around 15-20 years after their initial inception. Bitcoin isn't even six years old yet.
Now, to be entirely honest, I never expect bitcoin to unseat the various national currencies in the world and anyone who says otherwise should probably visit their local post office for a day to think about that a bit (hint: it's still busy).. Heck, with where I live, I doubt I'll ever be able to pay more than 30% of my bills with bitcoin, if any. That said, it's worth sticking to. Every transaction I can make with bitcoin I do. I'll be honest, I don't fully understand the inner workings of bitcoin, but I understand enough to realize it's potential and what it stands for. I understand enough to be able to teach others about it and help them understand it. I know Bitcoin will never be the "one and only" currency, but it certainly deserves a fighting chance.

We had a company wide email go out at my work to contact our representatives in favor of net neutrality.

Bitcoin will soon also buy computers and related services in the lakes region!

As of this week, my business accepts bitcoin, as of next week, I expect to do a lot of explaining about what bitcoin is.

First, wow that's more than I make in a year. 
More seriously-
Do you think that btc is better for having faucets like these or do you feel it causes btc to lose credibility to the "average" person? I have seen people use faucets as an argument that btc isn't real money because people wouldn't just give it up to random people like faucets do.

What if the site itself isn't using a Wordpress template? Is there a way for it to work through a non-template based service? The website is being designed by a senior at the local community college (small businesses can bid to have their sites be made by students as their final project to help the student's portfolio).
