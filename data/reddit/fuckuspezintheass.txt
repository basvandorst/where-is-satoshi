Are you paying fees to transfer that Bitcoin to him? Use Bitcoin Cash and avoid those fees. Or heck, a large amount of other cryptos are faster and cheaper

You're right, you can't do shit with Bitcoin anymore. But Bitcoin Cash on the other hand...you can actually use it to purchase stuff. Same with a few other cryptos, merchants already accept crypto. Just the way you do with cash.

Yes, but Bitcoin.com still sells BTC and the only bad things I hear is about the owner and his agenda...

Again, you're simplying the story quite a bit. Lord of the Rings was about 2 friends. 
The only reason I'm not doubting OP is because the type of person to write that story does sound pathetic enough for it to be real - I'm talking about the whole story he wrote and not the part you keep simplifying it to.

There's no need to apologize, I'm not asking for an apology. I just want people to know the truth of this sub

Can't really argue how someone else feels, but ok.


You mean...kinda like Bitcoin.com does? Even if you go up top and select BCH/USD it takes you to a page that mentions...dun dun dun...how to buy, store, and use Bitcoin.


Kinda like how when you search for "Buy bitcoin with credit card" or similar Bitcoin.com comes up and you can buy Bitcoin pretty easily?
That's why I asked if it was sarcasm.
I get people don't like BCH/Roger Ver, but at least maybe use insults against him/Bitcoin.com that are actually true?

I guess I was thinking of the word scam as something more misleading/severe, but you're right. But that still has absolutely nothing at all to do with the topic at hand lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:02:47
Is this sarcasm?

That is a VERY fucking simplified version of the story I just read from OP. Someone winning the lottery? not unheard of. Someone surviving a plane crash? Not unheard of. Someone winning the lottery and then surviving a plane crash, makes you question their story. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:06:51
On the site and all throughout the transaction it mentions BTC and not BCH
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:23:56
Except every time people post this, multiple people come in to claim the opposite. Why do you think it is a scam?  I received my BTC, by the way. The issue was with my wallet. So damn, they're pretty bad scammers
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:29
Now think about why you did that. This sub is full of lies and delusion
