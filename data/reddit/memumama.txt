It is certainly conceivable that there exists an incentive for exchanges to explicitly assert that they will not engage in insider trading, despite its being legal to do so. People would presumably find such exchanges to be more attractive than ones that may GOX them. Are there any exchanges currently in existence that have made such a statement?
I don't know much about legal matters, but making such a statement would also presumably offer legal recourse for customers if they ever choose to engage in insider trading---they would be guilty of knowingly making false claims about their service.

Suppose that you think that the probability that Gox will get its shit together is 10% (seems reasonable to me), then the expected utility is approximately $50 per btc purchased. Not that crazy of an investment, particularly if you think the odds are &gt; than 10%.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:03:41
If you think that the probability of Gox coming back online soon is greater than something like 10%, it's not an obviously bad move IMO. This is only if you are not looking to use BTC anytime soon. Coinbase is the most reputable way to get btc.

I'm with you, but perhaps my response can be that this treatment of value---of approaching zero as we subdivide to infinity---seems out of place when discussing economic value. 
Actually, maybe all of this business about infinity was unnecessary for the argument in the first place. The interesting phenomenon is present, I think, even for the current conventional division of Bitcoin. Just hear me out once more:
(1) Economic value is exchange value---i.e. the value of a thing is determined entirely by the things that others will exchange for it on the open market.
(2) There is nothing that can be bought on the open market for one satoshi. (Perhaps you could find someone to exchange something for one satoshi, but I suspect that that thing is something that they would have simply given to you for free anyways)
(3) Given 1 and 2, a satoshi is of zero value.
(4) The value of one Bitcoin  = the value of 100 million satoshis.
(5) Given 3 and 4, the value of one Bitcoin = 0 times 100 million.
(6) Given 5, one Bitcoin is absolutely worthless.
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:07:54
This is true, but there are still some issues. Though you can store your private keys in multiple locations, you'll presumably have to invest in several high-quality safes in multiple locations to do so. The average user would, it seems to me, prefer that a someone else took care of this. There are also security concerns having to do with printing out the paper keys in the first place---worries about malware on your computer or printer beaming the private key to your life savings up to the mothership. There are precautions that can be taken to avoid these problems, but I guess it seems that the typical user would far prefer the convenience of a conventional banking experience to spending a few hours reading up on the various potential traps and how to avoid them.

Occasionally, as a matter of fact. I teach formal logic and such sentences are examples of how negation works. If you have some proposition, P, and that proposition is true, then not-P is false. If you then take the negation of not-P (not-not-P), then you will again end up with a true sentence. That sentence is logically equivalent to P.

Bitcoin is a solid investment. If you can't see this, then you don't understand what it is. Buying Bitcoin now is like investing in the internet when it was invented if that had been possible. It is a world-changing technology. It has the network effect working to its advantage. It has a ton of people working around the clock, many for free, to make it succeed.
In addition, the aversion to taking on new debt to make decent investments has always struck me as odd. The underlying reasoning would also lead you to conclude that you should pay off all existing debt before making any investment, and this is simply misguided. I'm currently a student, and have a good amount of student debt, but I always invest a decent amount of my meager grad student stipend in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. The expected returns over time vastly outrun the low interest rate of my loans.

You might think that the government should intervene to make sure that those who use the country's infrastructure while making a fortune pay their fair share to the rest of us. 
Most of us think that a decent society/community will not allow its elderly citizens to die of starvation, but will ensure that at least their basic needs are provided for. If Bitcoin undermines the government's ability to collect taxes to such these operations, we ought to be concerned.
Of course, most tax dollars go to finance the military and prison industrial complexes. If Bitcoin undermines the government's ability to collect taxes to finance these operations, we ought to support it.

It works with weight as well, though. If it was possible to divide a lump of gold into infinitely many parts, then each of these parts would have non-zero weight. Since there would be infinitely many pieces of gold with non-zero weight, your resulting gold pieces would weigh more than 1oz---they would have infinite weight. In the case of gold, we can solve this problem by simply denying that gold is infinitely divisible. We cannot avail ourselves of this response in the case of Bitcoin.

"Divvying something up doesn't make more of it, it just makes more pieces of it."
I agree. I didn't mean to suggest that dividing 1 Bitcoin creates more Bitcoins. 
Let me try again: 
(1) For divisible currencies, the value of a certain unit of that currency is equivalent to the total value of its sub-units. E.G. The value of one dollar is equivalent to the value of one penny times 100.
(2) Given (1), Bitcoin is equal in value to infinitely many subunits, since it is infinitely divisible
(3) If something is infinitely divisible, it is infinite in quantity. E.G. If a lump of gold was infinitely divisible, it itself would be infinite in quantity. 
(4) If something is infinite in quantity, then it is not scarce, and has zero value.
(5) 1 Bitcoin has infinitely many subunits, and so given (4), those subunits have a value of zero. *Note that this doesn't mean that there are infinitely many Bitcoins (unit), it means that there is an infinite quantity of Bitcoin (currency)*
(6) Given (5) and (1), the value of one Bitcoin is equal to 0 times infinity.

Well, if they really intend to open up the source *as much as possible*, then that means that it will be fully open, since its clearly *possible* to fully disclose the source code for any program.
I think that the second point made in the passage is really important, though, and doesn't clearly imply that they do not intend for their source code to be fully open. Open source code is obviously not sufficient for privacy or safety, and this has been something that many of us in the Bitcoin community have been prone to overlook---take for example the widely held false belief that Bitcoin is in-and-of-itself a perfectly anonymous, or near anonymous, currency. Bitcoin is itself open source, but is the exact opposite of private. You've got to do a lot more to make it private, and it seems that this will require more than technological innovation. Perfect privacy on the internet will likely be impossible until significant political change has occurred in the US and in other countries to eliminate the massive surveillance apparatus that exists today.

You cannot honestly believe that this is the way that politics works. You seriously think that our elected leaders are "experts" in determining what is most in the public's interest? You think that they are qualified to make important long-term decisions? 
There is no good reason to think that the general person would be less capable of making the good decisions than politicians. At least the general individual is not entirely beholden to the massive corporations that finance elections. We all know that the primary function of the politician is to maximize profits for their rich supporters.
The average person actually knows what it is like to be an average person and is thus in a particularly good position to know what would most benefit the average person in society. 
Your denigration of the common person is part of a long and despicable tradition, but I hope that we will soon leave such attitudes behind.

They really need to get this straightened out. If they tell you that you'll get BTC at Friday's price, and they instead fulfill the order before then, they are exposing themselves to a significant amount of liability. 
Suppose that you place an order for $1000 worth of BTC and agree that this will be at Friday's price. Suppose that an hour later, Coinbase gets some coin and fulfills your order when BTC is trading at $1000. You now have 1 BTC. Suppose that Friday now rolls around, and the price has dropped significantly---it's now trading at $500/BTC. The price then recovers on Saturday  to $1000. 
In this situation, many people would be very angry. Worse, Coinbase's message does not say that the price *might* be Friday's. It would seem that in the case described above, a breach of contract occurred, and resulted in the customer's loss of $1000. The loss would obviously be much greater for many who are buying in high volume. 
It would help to have some clarification regarding how Coinbase is handling these orders.

* (2) Individuals who come to Reddit to complain will often fail to report back when the issue has been resolved.

You won't find many actual economists these days who use the words "intrinsic value" in the way that Peter Schiff and company have been using it. It only makes sense to speak of value within some social context---value is relative to context. 
Gold has value because people are willing to exchange other things for it. People want gold for all sorts of reasons. Some want it because it looks pretty, others want it because of the particular physical properties that it has, others want it because they know that they will be able to exchange it for other things. Gold can become obsolete for all of these purposes, and so it seems obvious for this reason that it does not make sense to say that Gold has intrinsic value. More obviously, it is clearly nonsense to maintain that gold would be valuable even in a world where there were no people to use it---but this is what is meant by the claim that gold has intrinsic value.
Bitcoins are abstract, non-tangible objects---they do not exist in any one place or time. But this does not mean that they are useless. A song is not a tangible object, but it has value nonetheless. Likewise for ideas---you cannot hold ideas, but trillions of dollars have been spent on them because they are often useful and good ones are relatively rare. 
Bitcoins are abstract objects that are very useful and also relatively rare. They are desired by people for lots of different reasons, and they therefore currently have value in the same way that Gold does.

This is fantastic. It would be great if Mint could allow for users to "watch" public addresses of their choosing. This would have several advantages. This would be neutral between different services---it would work with Coinbase, paper wallets, multibit, and all the rest. It would also be good because users would not have to trust Mint with their private login information.
Keep up the good work! 
EDIT: This apparently would not work with Coinbase given the way that they store Bitcoins. On an related note, why does Coinbase choose not to store coins at addresses associated with specific users? I'm sure there's some good reason for adding additional complexity.

Really? There are so many things that could go wrong with an online service like Coinbase. 
* They could get "hacked," as many other online wallets already have. 
* One of their employees with access to their cold storage could clear them out.
* They could go out of business
* They could find some huge flaw in their codebase that makes it impossible for them to determine your balance. 
* They might fuck up and not care about responding to your support requests.
* Your computer might get malware that empties your wallet after you have already logged in and 2authed (they don't require 2FA for sending BTC).
* Something might go wrong with Authy and you will lose you ability to login to your wallet.
* Something might happen that makes Coinbase's cold storage inaccessible/destroyed
If you do your own cold storage right (not that hard), then there are far fewer things that could go wrong.

But the point is that when something actually is infinite in divisibility, this means that it actually is necessarily infinite in quantity. For analogy, if it was possible to divide a piece of gold into infinitely many pieces, then this means that you have an infinite amount of gold (this is just a consequence of the laws of logic). Luckily, gold is not infinitely divisible---Bitcoin is. Ergo, Bitcoin is infinite in quantity

An investment of .06 BTC is just as valuable as a personal investment as one of 1,000 BTC---if the value increases 100% over the next month, both investments will have doubled. Moreover, if .06 BTC is all that you can comfortably invest, it is likely that your returns will be even more valuable to you than the returns of the person who has invested in 1,000 BTC, given diminishing utility.
For one of the approximately one billion individuals living on less than 1$ per day, the $600 return on such an investment if BTC were to go to $10,000 would be more life changing than the returns gained by someone who had invested in 1000 BTC.

With regard to  it seems that you would have some sort of moral obligation to not spend the coins.
