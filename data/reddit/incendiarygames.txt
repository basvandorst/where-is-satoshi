Margins can change daily on futures at CBOE's and CME's discretion. They base it off the realized volatility. For example Natural Gas (/NG) this past week the margin has varied from $1,500 a contract to $2,400 a contract.

Few reasons, the contract is for the *future*, so people are speculating on bitcoin's price in the future. Selling a contract now means you have to settle cash on that price, so you miss out on opportunity cost by selling now vs holding on bitcoin directly if it goes higher. Then there is the "risk-free" interest rate, or what you could get if you invested in safe treasuries or other bonds over the time period. Then, coinbase/etc have transaction and conversion fees. So subtract coinbase's 1.49% conversion fee to get a 5.5% arbitrage opportunity. Then there may be some accounting for the time &amp; fees it takes to transfer from a wallet you fully control to coinbase too with bitcoin's volatility over every hour. That could easily add another 1-1.5% if the value of your coins drops from wallet to making it to coinbase over an hour waiting for confirms, so you're looking at about a realistic 4% arbitrage opportunity right now, still quite juicy for the holding period. 
The volume on the contracts are insanely low right now, about 40 a minute.  The regular futures market for other products trades 10k-20k contracts a minute. Any sort of volume may have the market move closer to it's actual price, so its an open question on how much you can realize this. If the price converges in say 4x the normal volume then you might only get 120 contracts in, or $2.16 million worth of BTC, at a 4% gain being $86.4k. So it's a pretty small arbitrage opportunity to exploit currently, assuming you can time it and buy BTC at the exact same time so that 4% spread remains. 
And another problem is you have to have the cash on hand to margin such a trade as the future exchange won't take your word you have X bitcoins backing it. The margin requirement is 30% for bitcoin currently, so you'd need 30% of bitcoin's worth in cash with the exchange, and some extra to prevent the hassle dealing with margin calls, so lets say 50% to avoid any hassles with ups and downs. Suddenly having that 50% margin means the cash sitting around is more like a 2.6% arbitrage as you can't use that cash to make other trades except maybe treasuries (depending on your broker agreement.) So now, you're making $80k off of 3 million sat around, so it's a 2.6% arbitrage play and it's getting very close to the risk free rate now.  (2 million in BTC to have zero risk, and 1 million to satisfy future exchange's margin and not have to wire in funds if you get margin called.)
Plus with bitcoin exchange limits of say $15k/week at coinbase, it's hard for most users to make a play like this quickly. I'd be expecting this to converge pretty soon.
