It will support Bitcoin but they use very careful wording to be attractive to legacy system players. In my opinion, they could ignore the legacy system and sell bitcoin-only solutions but since their protocol is open and way ahead of the legacy system, banks and other financial institutions would adopt it anyway with their own modifications. Mycelium simply decided to capitalize on this by offering a ready-to-use product to both worlds.

The quickest way would be to use a bitcoin machine, there is quite a few of them in Canada. 
Mine is in Vancouver @ Steamrollers on Robson/Bute. 
Alternatively, you can meet local traders from localbitcoins.com or, like others say, open an account with an online exchange.

No, I did that tx directly from bitcoind. But other transactions were higher, 1+ BTC.

What happens, though, if myTREZOR.com goes down? I know I can recover the wallet in another app compatible with the same tech, but it would be less secure that way. Are the guys at Satoshi Labs working on open-source servers that anyone can run or something like that?
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:58:29
You'll be able to restore the wallet with your seed in another wallet that works the same way. Or you can get another Trezor and use the "Recovery" functionality.

Try donations. Maybe even ads if it gets popular. I understand you want some reward for the app, who wouldn't? But bitcoiners are mostly open-source minded people. Try to come up with a revenue model that can work even if you open the source-code.

Ripple has been such an exchange for a while, it works. But you do need to trust a third party (a gateway) with your funds anyway.
To be honest, I don't really understand how you can do that without trusting a third party. From the Bitsquare example I can see that it's a trustless exchange, the infographic tells me that funds are released when both parties agree that the fiat payment (in that case to Bob's bank account) has been made. If not, there is collateral involved. It's all good but how does it help day traders? It's definitely a solution for a one-time buyer or seller but not for people who trade constantly. 
I may have missed it but if you know of a solution that lets you day trade fiat vs crypto without depositing your funds with a third party, please let me know.
@_date: 2014-07-07 21:25:22
I see. Good luck with the project anyway! We need more of this!

The backend software is already there but not the full version. They're adding more features. I did have issues with it, but now that it's up to date I don't really have to restart it anymore. My next step is to switch from blockchain.info to bitcoind because the former is not reliable at all and the machine currently depends on it.

I've been suing them for a while now. "Canadian Citizens" is incorrect and must be edited. I am not a citizen, I am a temporary (soon-to-be permanent) resident in this country. Which is different from being a citizen. 
Or they must let me know right now that because I don't hold a Canadian passport, my account will be disabled.

Lol. The argument mostly goes for the mainstream audience. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:34:56
The thing is that too many things depend on blockchain.info now. Not only those ATMs but many websites and services that use their API as well as all the merchants that chose to use their merchant app.

It's just that particular BTM, their fees are high because most probably they're the only ones in the area. The more machines the lower the fees.
I run a Lamassu machine. While most machines in town charge around 5% and up, I normally charge 3.5% and consider it a good deal. Moreover, I have removed the fee (0%) until further notice so I can attract more new customers. 
Overall, having BTM fees is not bad in any way and I haven't seen a customer complaining about it. They understand that I spent money on the machine and take time to maintain it.

QuickCoin wallet uses bits by default, as far as I know. Wasn't BitPay thinking of switching to bits as well?
Should a couple of big players switch and it'll become a norm, I think.

So they want to compete with MaidSafe which launches in a couple of months. Good luck.

It's just a bitcoin deposit. Any deposit amount has the same result. There's another place where they say it takes 6 confirmations. But this place is more visible.

1) Yes, you do, if the old one is awful. 
2) First time I hear about it. Can't believe such nonsense can even start affecting this community.

I doubt this is the case. A local court case doesn't reflect the general mood in the Russian government. Moreover, courts are mostly controlled by the government in Russia (duh), so either the government allowed it to happen or simply ignored it for now.

Many more BTMs are coming, everywhere. This will naturally drive markups down. 
I personally never went above 3.5% as I think this fee is reasonable.
But keep in mind that some machines cost much more than that, up to $20k. So those operators have to set higher fees at least while they're in the period of ROI.

Just came from there. Paid with CC. Stoopid.

Although I don't charge any commission with [my BTM in Vancouver]( I think 5% (and down to 3-3.5% depending on competition in the area) is fair enough for operators and customers. 12% is a bit over the top.
EDIT: Spelling.

True, but we are talking about the public perception of religious/occult symbolism. Such symbols on the dollar or Apple products haven't caused any mass hysteria so far.
The fact that some people take a claim on two crossing lines because there happens to be a similar occurrence in their religion bothers me as much as some companies that want to patent rectangles: not at all, for it's nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:47:20
Sure, tell all the Apple fans about that. The company's primary focus is on design and their logo is connected to religion directly: the first bite of the apple represents the fall of man.

Yes, the previous one isn't, fees paid. Network problems?

Goddammit, Russia. Now Bitcoin will just go underground there.

You may want to check out Federal Reserve notes for occult symbolism, they are used all over the world . It doesn't seem to pose a problem to the majority, does it?

IMO, MaidSafe will do it much faster (testnet 2 up and running already) starting with a protocol that runs on top of the existing infrastructure. Later on we can run MaidSafe on meshnets and voila, a decentralized ISPless and serverless Internet.

Definitely to Ƀ. I've said it many times and the author makes an excellent case in the article.
When people run out of arguments some start saying things like "but this Ƀ looks like an inverted cross which is so satanic and anti-Christian" and others take it seriously.

Cool! Thanks for the replies!
Good luck with the project!

Wow, check out their other projects. How come I've never heard of you, guys?

It would be cool if hubs were able to charge users small fees for usage. Combined with a full node in one device, they could become attractive to people who want to help the network grow and earn fees at the same time, thus incentivizing more people to run their own nodes boosting the network decentralization as a result.
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:23:43
That would be a question for the devs. Hopefully, they'll jump into the discussion.

I think the negativity comes from hearing about an "elite" gathering in a secret location to discuss currency. This very familiar setting causes, in my opinion, justified concerns. 
However, this may simply be an innocent get-together that has nothing to do with any agenda. People raising concerns, though, shouldn't be regarded as "tinfoil hats".

It looks like one of the chunks (a random one, not selected by the leaker) will be automatically made public so that bidders can verify its authenticity and decide if they want to purchase the rest.

All his projects are close-sourced. You have to trust him. Been there, done that.
