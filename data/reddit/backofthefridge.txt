Which 2 do you get with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:17:27
Pick 1, you mean.  Bitcoin is neither fast nor cheap right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:10
I'd sleep better if the mempool wasn't skyrocketing.  Currently ~172,000 unconfirmed transactions.

From a libertarian point of view, he's completely correct.  There shouldn't be insider trading laws.

This sub does this all the time.  Comparing a total currency value to an equity market cap makes no sense whatsoever, but we do it anyway for some reason.

This is what he [wrote back in February:](  "Right now they are, as far as I can see, just another novelty trading market. It may be that at some time in the future that market will mature but for now Bitcoins are purely a speculative instrument with serious liquidity problems and have no place in the portfolio of investors."
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:24:25
Um, there are millions of people wondering what exactly happened to those coins.  What are you talking about?

As a bitcoiner, I still believe that credit cards have a right to exist.

I suppose you could make the claim that credit card transactions actually take 30-60 days to fully confirm, in case the buyer decides to initiate a chargeback.

That doesn't make any sense.  He didn't "hold onto" those bitcoins, he exchanged them with someone who didn't deliver.
Besides, 98 bitcoins in October was worth much, much less than $55,000.

Yes, sending an envelope full of cash to a Ukrainian address is an excellent idea.

Those "big names" aren't really accepting BTC, though.  BitPay is accepting BTC for them to immediately turn into dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:36:07
Really?  Having personal custody over his clients' assets isn't a red flag to you?  99.9% of these types of funds are held by a third-party broker/dealer.  Performing the exact returns year in and year out (with almost no variance) doesn't seem strange?  That makes sense to you?
As far as Mt.Gox goes, just spending 5 minutes with Google would tell you they've been having unaccounted-for withdrawal issues for 8 months &amp; people have been warning about them for literally years.
Again, do some homework before you invest your money.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:54:13
For some perspective, for the 5 months after June '11 BTC went down about 90%.

I honestly think this is the best compromise.

@_date: 2017-11-14 12:44:06
Be careful what you wish for...now the multi-billion dollar hedge funds that want to easily short BTC will be able to.  The CME is a far more trustworthy platform for these types of trades compared to anything else out there.

The best argument I've heard for investing in Litecoin is simply a hedge against a successful Bitcoin attack;  if BTC is attacked in a way that renders it useless - however remote that scenario is - Litecoin may skyrocket in price as the next defacto cyptocurrency.
