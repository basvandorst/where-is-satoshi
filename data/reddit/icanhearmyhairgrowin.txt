I've always thought that no matter what any government or entity could do to a person, the one place they can't get to is inside your head. At this point it's the only place where you can be certain to have 100% privacy.
But recently it seems that we won't even have that.
Netflix knows what I like to watch.
Spotify knows what I like to listen to.
Amazon knows what I like to buy.
Shoprite knows what I like to eat.
Our ISPs know all of the above plus what kind of porn we like.
Our location data tells them where we like to go and who we associate with.
I could go on but with all that data what more is our brain if our thoughts can be predicted so accurately. And furthermore, as soon as we have the tech for a westworld style replicant, they can kill us off and replace us with someone who's virtually identical in appearance and personality.

Yeah I may have gone off topic a little but you don't exactly have to worry about that against the government. I doubt any of us will get tortured for a wallet password. 
If a gang or just any criminal wanted your wallet password then yeah I'd probably give that shit up with just the THREAT of torture. I see people online flaunting about how they're thinking about retiring from their Bitcoin investments and all that. All it takes is one psycho to do exactly what that XKCD describes and then your whole fortune is gone and even if you follow the money via the block chain if the person knows what they're doing there's a decent chance they'll get away with it.

Then say you "forgot" the pw instead of "refusing" to unencrypt.

TLDR?
