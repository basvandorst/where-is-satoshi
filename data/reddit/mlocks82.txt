Except that prices aren't exactly "low" considering the 10 fold  increase from where it was trading  just 18-24 months ago.  I'm not saying it won't eventually go much higher, but fiat money flow is going in the wrong direction with investor funds exiting the market.  Couple this with paper trading and shorting in the futures market and suffice it to say there is substantial risk at the moment. Bottom line  is that we are likely  heading lower in the short term.
  
Bitcoin slumps to fresh 15-month low as crypto rout continues

Bitcoin prices tumbled to a fresh 15-month low on Thursday as the digital currency rout continued.
Bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.30%  fell to $3,230.00, down 6.1% since Wednesday at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken exchange—its lowest level since Sept. 15, 2017.
What are analysts saying
After plunging through $6,000 on Nov. 14, bitcoin has struggled for any meaningful bounce, falling in four of the past five trading weeks, and according to one analyst, the longer it treads water the more susceptible it becomes to another move lower.
“Bitcoin continues to muddle along in the mid-$3K range. The longer we maintain these levels, the less likely it becomes that prices are oversold and poised for a pop,” wrote Jani Ziedins of CrackedMarket. “The public has largely written cryptocurrencies off as a fad and no new money is coming in. The lack of demand will continue to be a big liability.”
