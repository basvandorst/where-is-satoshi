Thank you!
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:28:42
Yeah, I'm surprised wallets with large amounts were left on servers that could be easily confiscated.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:11:58
I've only done cash.  I can't trust putting my bank info out there anymore than it already is.

No kidding!  Even taking a usb with you that had your wallet in it (encrypted of course).  And even if that was seized, it would take years for them to figure out the password.  By then you could have moved the wallet somewhere else.

Add riseup and sigaint as well.  Both can be donated to with Bitcoin.  Both are secure.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:53:15
Yeah, hopefully Voat is working much better by that time.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:09:41
Learn algorithms, finance, and economics.  That should be a good start.

Hopefully, these banks don't try to make their own crypto currencies.  Just use what's not so broken.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:13:35
Shouldn't this be a sticky?  I think your bot may need a bit of tweaking.  Unless, you don't care to sticky this.  
@_date: 2015-07-28 03:35:17
Hahaha.  But, I guess everyone has to start somewhere. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:56:19
I don't think people got the sarcasm in my posts.... ha!
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:18:00
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:44:17
It's just something that would catch more eyes, I think.  Call it marketing.  Just my two satoshis.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:01:54
The breeze was the best!

Should be able to use a prepaid card.
@_date: 2015-08-09 11:10:13
Could you explain The halvening?
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:50:56
I can see it.  I don't know. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:50:53
Are you trying to launder your money?  There may be easier ways...
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:26:42
Is there no way to withdraw your funds?  That would be the first thing I would look at.  
Worst case scenario is they are getting as much Bitcoin as they can before they are gone.  
If you know anyone in Missouri maybe they can stop by their office?

Yeah, if you are already getting tips why ask for more?  Pretentious.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:53:43
localbitcoins.com  pretty easy if you ask me.
Edit:  If available, you can meet face to face with someone.  And also use cash.  The last time I did it, it took about an hour.  I don't know how quick you mean....Maybe find an ATM? (You can also find those at localbitcoins.com)
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:30:04
I don't know why they keep on with the dark side of bitcoin.  Cash can be used the same way.  It's just easier to find in a bust.  
I think this is the most important part of the article


If, GS is getting in on it and as corrupt as they are...to the moooon!
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:36:00
Yeah, sounded like it was unencrypted...
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:48:21
You're the one shadow banning people. hahaha!  
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:44:32
See?  Your post is still here?  Why are you complaining that you were shadow banned?
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:16:12
Thanks for responding!
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:57:17
For bartering?  Depends.  Does the person I am bartering with have bleached tip hair, jnco jeans, and waiting for the newest episode of Home Improvement?  Hur hur hur....hrgh?!  
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:16:18
Good luck!

My point is, the thread is for beginners maybe some more technical things at times.  Most beginners are not going to go to the 'new' tab and search for mentor Monday.  It's just better for the exposure.  Just my two satoshi...
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:07:17
As long as they are still in your wallet that should be a good sign.  LBC is pretty good about these things.  Keep us updated!
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:20:09
I thought I was already making a bet when buying bitcoin.  :)
I'm sure there would be interest.  Hell, there are even bitcoin lottos.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:59:01
Shadow banned ....  
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:59:12
heh.  I threw another reply with a bunch of sources.  I've never bought litecoin so hopefully one of them will work for you.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:09:18
No.  Your money is legit to begin with.  Money Laundering is trying to make dirty money look like it came from some legit source.  Your good, I was just messin' with ya!
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:53:08
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:00:17
Have you tried looking on blockchain.info to check the receiving address?  Any confirmations?  Or is it just not leaving your LBC wallet?
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:30:36
But, wouldn't you want that thread to have the most exposure for those that are new to Bitcoin?  Isn't that the reason for the thread in the first place?  Also, you can have two stickies now.  Leave 'Mentor Monday' up for a couple days then take it back down.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:14:38
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:17:27
Yeah, I'm seeing May unless I'm not reading something right.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:42:11
Good advice since most phone companies don't give a shit about updating older (1+ years old) phones.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:49:58
Yeah, but when our robot overloads don't care about paper money then what will you use to buy nutritious Slourp(TM) for sustenance? 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:57:05
pay off your bills before they hurt your credit.  Send them the details and invoice of how much they owe you. Plus, the $50 they said would be guaranteed.  Not much else you can do.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:43:48
Your other post is still visible.  I'm not sure what you are going on about...
