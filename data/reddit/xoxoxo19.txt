Thanks! I know this is the case with the cash app (square cash in its day) but just wanted to make sure. I wouldn’t want to stop using it because it is a decent source of income for me.

Sorry to bring this up again guys, but I’m still wondering is it safe to send them those pics they require? Of the front and back of my ID and my face?
Open a new debit card and make another circle pay account? It worked fine for a long time until I guess I got too much money sent to it cumulatively? I’m just weary is all. Sorry to be annoying I just really need some help here. Thanks guys and gals!

Guys I have over $100 in there that I want to get �� is it safe to send them a picture of my ID?

Say but I just think it’s uncomfortable that they ask for a picture of me and my ID, as if I didn’t already provide my other info.

So I sent them my address and last four of my ss, before I did that I changed it from my stage name to my real name, and then switched it right back, and it was working for a couple days. Now, I’m trying to transfer 50 to my banks and didn’t work and now they want a picture of my ID. What gives? Should I bother? Or just retire circle? It sucks, it’s not where I get most of my side income, but man 50 is 50. I clicked on circle so that people see my email not my name, so I guess I can switch back to my real name for a while but it’s pretty crucial that my real name remains hidden.
Advice? Thanks everyone
