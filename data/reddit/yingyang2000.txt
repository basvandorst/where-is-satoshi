Seriously?! You would have better luck getting a cardboard sign saying you are hungry and go sit at a busy intersection

So, can you send bitcoin to your CashApp and then cash it out there and get deposit to bank account?

Actually I didn’t...I dint know the fee until the transaction processed and I paid from same wallet I always use and the fee is never anywhere near that...You can keep your patronizing statements to yourself Troll...thanks XOXO

A couple weeks ago I emailed customer service regarding withdrawal BTC from CashApp. Their response was that they hey are not currently set up to cash out to your bank, etc ., the BTC you own. You can only purchase BTC, SEND IT, OR RECEIVE it with CashApp

Only put as much into bitcoin that you don’t mind losing...Think of it as buying a lottery ticket. You did not share your current financial situation. If you have debt, don’t own a home, etc., it would be better to invest the money in paying off debt and purchasing a home

So, I have some bitcoin I need to sell because I need the cash. I don’t think I want to do P2P, cause I don’t want to risk the other person not following through or having to sell a little at a time. I was recommended Kraken. However, sending my bitcoin to their corporate wallet makes me nervous too. Has anyone had either positive or negative experiences with Kraken or can recommend a better  xchange.  I want something trustworthy with the least amount of fees as possible. I am in the US. I also was recommended CashApp, but when I looked into it, you can only buy and sell BTC, and not send yourself BTCyou currently own to sell.
