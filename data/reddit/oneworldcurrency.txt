I like that yeah I'm feeling it
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:36:19
Yeah I just took satoshi as a scientist and I think his name is well enough known. Can't we just have some basic normal measurements?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:55:53
Yeah it's fine. I just think someone can think of something better if we let them
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:27:45
Hahaha ironic eh? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:21:02
That's a good point it's still just reminds me of a Ben Franklin kinds thing I was thinking more along the lines of the science of value or blah blah
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:47:52
I just think it needs to be more simple and not separate from our day to day
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:41:17
Well I'm not defending this guy and I'm a long time bitcoin fan. I just think we need to have both around. If it was only bitcoin all the money would end up with one group of elite and the rest of the world would work for them. I think we need both for a healthy ecosystem relationship.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:41:01
Just my opinion but a lot of people depend on fiat. Most people do. If we switched to bitcoin drastically then social security and retirement funds pretty much goes to dirt. So how are old people gonna work to pay for the drugs they need? Something like 1/3 of the population would die off pretty quickly. Then you'd have the super rich in bitcoin hiring the super poor to do everything. Just enough to feed them but not enough to gain any financial independents. It'll pretty much become a communism or tyranny. The rich always get richer and the poor stay poor but if there was a finite amount then it'll be more drastic. You can say goodbye to the middle class.

Does feel kinds negative, where are all the fun hype posts 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:29:19

No this is the Krusty Crabs
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:44:25
Idk if you knew about when it was at 100 dollars and dropped down to 1 dollar and they thought it was dead. Turns out it's not. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:41:23
This is a big reason I want global adoption of bitcoin. Lemme know where my tax money is going. I'll follow the transactions 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:58:11
Funny seeing this 15 hrs later
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:45:45
Well they certainly don't believe it is and it is only what you believe it is and I believe it's a global currency.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:11:08
I second 
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:11:55
NO THIS IS PATRICK
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:52:06
I have a question. If I wanted to drive the price up on the fees could I just start paying more and more and artificially compete with myself and make the fees ridiculously expensive that way?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:53:23
I paid $.09 going from blockchain mobile app. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:21:50
They can't see the vision. They must be out of focus 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:42:37
When I run out of money or bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:57:37
50k then crash to 10k?
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:13:56
No spend it and buy more
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:36:57
That's what we are currently shaking lose right now. Feels good to get the clean hodlers concentrated again. Maybe the newcomers will leave the subreddits too
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:21:10
We need a subreddits for trading with bitcoin.

There were 50,000 shoes manufactured this month 
Source: I lied but I have credibility
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:38:56
Fiat or bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:18:21
I've been paying .09 cents fees lately 
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:49:45
This is exactly what i did whenever woodforest bank wouldn't allow me to buy. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:50:26
What if there was a way new miners had to mine all the cheap transactions. Work their way up or something. Idk I feel like the fee problem is within the miners. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:42:31
More miners less fees?
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:49:32
I always thought they were all just to make more money and turn it back into REAL bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:05:50
Id spend it at the store no matter what it's worth now. Or then
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:05:57
Who is the house?
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:00:56
Yeah true but it has the support and some great minds who could do this. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:55:30
Yeah I know this is the actual bitcoin and all the forks are just trying to act like they're bitcoin for the same gains. Kinda like counterfeit money. Looks the same except it's fake. I don't even know why I called it core. Doesn't make sense 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:13:14
We need a reddit swapshop for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:33:02
It's only a ponzi if it doesn't work. If it does, it's a money. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:54:32
Idk we will see
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:47:29
God do I pray it does. A minor fall and major lift. Everytime. My grandchildren will thank me one day
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:45:01
I want to see bitcoin being used like we use money. I want to be able to buy stocks using bitcoin. I don't think of bitcoin like I think of stock. I think of bitcoin like I'm converting USD to euro 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:13:59
Well we can sure try our best. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:26:58
I support bitcoin but I think this can be realized without being said 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:38:56
Very simple and it's the beauty of capitalism. One business acting up then move to another
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:57:27
Come on lower lower loweeerrrrr
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:04:54
Games!! If you can get games back involved us millinial will jump on that 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:07:43
I will and then buy morreeeeee
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:56:37
Can we still buy drugs?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:19:32
Well we will find someone who will
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:52:28
Mine said it cost .10 cents using blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:45:57
Source please? I think I'll buy more
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:29
That's probably how I seem right now
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:29:25
Woodforest blocked mine and I wasn't even using credit.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:09:37
currently best wallet? Used to own some and used electrum? What is it now?
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:33:09
Thanks to?
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:34:20
Are these rocks a ponzi too? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:41:52
This. New markets are always volatile. Gold was too until everyone used it
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:02:44
I can't afford it yet. Lowerrrrr
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:27:42
Idk what your using but I have the blockchain app on my phone and I moved .4 btc for $.10
Right now it does still take 30 min. But it shows up quick just needs to be confirmed. It's figuring it out. Cellphone didn't just start off the way they are now
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:00:05
I use a more tolerant bank now. The beauty of capitalism is if one bank fails we can move to another. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:49:41
Maybe you're right. I do though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:28:17
Everyone on reddit is a bot except me
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:42:22
What bitcoin has that other alt coins don't is commitment. Most people are committed to bitcoin and see all the other coins as distractions or pump and dumb trying to gain more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:48:53
Segwits bruh. I use blockchain wallet app. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:46:30
Okay I was kinda getting upset with the whole BS about wanting take down the government thing. I for one would like for the goverment to keep functioning. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:13:44
It's backed by us. We support it
