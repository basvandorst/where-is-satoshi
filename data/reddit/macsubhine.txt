Sponsorship and advertisement campaigns are fundamentally different, man. Sponsorships involve working relationships and sustained support, of which GAW does not give. You can argue semantics all you like, but you're wrong on this one. 
Regarding my disappointment that there were GAW ads on the site at one point, yeah. I was. 
Is there proof that GAW makes mistakes? Yes. Long-term problems? Yes. Management issues? Yes. 
Is there proof that GAW is a fraudulent entity? I see allegations, suggestions, perhaps even signs according to most descriptions of a "scam" -- but proof? Actual proof I can hold in my hands and write about? Show me.

I suspect that you have little idea of what you're talking about.

Hey folks,
Stan Higgins from CoinDesk here -- I can assure you that we have not been purchased by Josh Garza, GAW Miners, Genius At Work Corp. or any known or unknown corporate entity related to GAW. :)

Uhm...so if the company refers to themselves as "Blockchain", what purpose does it serve to state their name otherwise? This is kind of like saying that we should still be referring to Apple as Apple Computer.

Sorry to hear about that, man.

Fairly certain the title identifies the speculative frenzy that occurred following the launch. Where's the pump?

A regular at a bar has racked up an impressive -- but seemingly insurmountable -- tab. Even so, he still comes in most nights.
One night he asks the bartender for a drink. The bartender, well aware of the regular's schemes, tells him that he won't serve him.
"Please, please!" the regular says. The bartender sighs.
"Listen," the bartender begins. "I can't just keep letting you build up credit. But listen -- I'll make you a deal. I need a few things taken care of. If you can do these things, I'll consider your tab a thing of the past. Capiche?"
"Anything!" the regular declares.
"Alright. Okay, you see that guy over there?" The bartender points to a particularly mean -- and muscly -- gentleman at the other end of the bar. "He's got a tab almost as big as yours. I need you to collect.
"Then," the bartender continues. "I've got a German shepherd in the back room with a big ol' splinter in its paw. I'd take it out myself, but he's a mean bastard and I don't want to get bit. So you need to take out that splinter."
"Finally, my sweet old mother is nearing the end. I want her to have a good time before she goes, if you know what I mean. So...uh...I need you to go and show her a good time." The bartender winks and the regular shudders.
"But hey, that's a tall order, so here -- have a few drinks." The bartender begins pouring shots. After about half a dozen, the regular stands up and teeters slightly. 
He approaches the mean-looking man at the end of the bar, picks up a stool and smashes it over his head. He takes the wallet from the man's pocket and tosses it to the bartender. The regular then walks into the backroom. 
For a few minutes, the bartender hears horrible, blood-curdling screams, barking, yelping and some other unsettling noises. Finally, the regular emerges from the back room, sweaty and pale but with a satisfied grin on his face.
"Alright," he says. "Where's your mother with the splinter in her foot?"

I am Stan Higgins, a staff reporter for CoinDesk.
We are not owned, operated, sponsored, influenced, directed or guided by GAW. Swap out any applicable verbs you'd like in there, but the facts are the same.  
Now that that's out of the way, a few things from me, personally, as an observer of all this:
1: Maybe you should try using your real handle, For someone pushing accountability, you're off to a questionable start. 
2: You thought for a second Qntra was owned by GAW? LOL.
3: Try looking a bit harder. The answer, typically, is often right under your nose: 
EDIT: Josh Garza does not own, operate, sponsor, influence, direct or guide CoinDesk.

Ads in the past? Yes, there were ads on the site at one point. Scam? Show me the verifiable proof. Complicit? Hell no.

Posting support or criticism for a story's subject is one thing, the proliferation of fake accounts to upvote/downvote the opposition is entirely another. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:32:18
No worries. :)
Truthfully it's just speculation on my part -- I see their staff posting on Hash Talk with some frequency and the majority of their content is GAW-focused. Sorry if I came off as a bit of a dick there, btw. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:34:41
Agreed. And my apologies again for the rude comment about your handle. Any chance you can PM me your email?

Hey guys,
Stan Higgins from CoinDesk here. I'd like to apologize for the confusion here - did not mean to imply that ShapeShift is a decentralized service. 
My intention was to say that ShapeShift, like other services on the market, are creating solutions that are less centralized than exchanges that have a customer funding management structure.
We've removed that adjective which I hope reflects more accurately what ShapeShift and others are doing with their services. My apologies to both ShapeShift and the community, here and thanks for caring enough about crypto to make sure things are accurate.

If you've got time, do a side-by-side, sentence-by-sentence comparison and tell me why this article wasn't changed/removed by CT when alerted in September.

Updated with comment from Sen. Ann Rivers: 
“One of the goals of my Cannabis Patient Protection Act, which became law in 2015, was to eliminate the black and gray markets for cannabis in our state. SB 5264 addresses another part of the regulatory challenge. After all the work we’ve done to get a handle on the cannabis industry and help move it out of the shadows, allowing the use of unregulated currency for cannabis purchases doesn’t promote the level of transparency we committed to develop.”

Those who provided personal ID/payment (debit/credit card) info to CoinCut could potentially be affected as a result of the leak.
