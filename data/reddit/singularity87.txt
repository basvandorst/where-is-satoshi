Tell me. When the banks close today and may not open again until there is the drachma and capital controls start on Monday. How do people withdraw more than a few hundred euros from their bank account over the weekend?
Bitcoin gives people an exit strategy to at least some degree.

Thank you for taking the time to reply. I understand that their needs to be for profit development on Bitcoin based services and I have nothing against it all. A system of this size can only survive on goodwill for so long after all. The merits of arguing there could be ulterior motives are not particularly strong anyway.
I personally think there are two strong arguments against your position. Your argument against centralisation seems to be a false dilemma fallacy. There is an acceptable amount of centralisation of the system. Bitcoin is not perfectly decentralised right now and would likely be fine with a certain amount more centralisation (only up to a point of course). Saying that not even a small amount more centralisation can occur even if it solves very large problem is not a fair position to take in my opinion.
The second argument is more speculative but based on reason. This is also same reason why I believe keeping the current limit is extremely detrimental to bitcoin. Currently a lot of people and businesses have a lot (financially) riding on bitcoin's growth and utility. Whether you consider this to be a good or bad thing is irrelevant because it is fact. If bitcoin is allowed to grow naturally, how it was intended to, then it will have more users, more nodes and more miners. On the flip side if bitcoin is purposely limited in it's growth and utility then it will lose users and the number of nodes will decrease. Actually I don't think it is hyperbole to say; if the block size limit is not increased that bitcoin will very quickly wither away as all speculative money and businesses leave due to their investment having a low potential valuation.
I have been a part of the bitcoin community since 2011 and I have never seen bitcoin in such a dangerous position as it is now.
I fully understand that second layer protocols like the lightning network are absolutely required to increase bitcoin's utility but, as far as I can tell, these are nowhere near ready yet and we should not be using them as reason to not solve current problems. We should be using a temporary solution to gives us time to implement more permanent solutions like the lightning network.

While miners are free to set their own limits on tx-fees I wouldn't complain if all miner implemented a low fee rule. At the moment, at least the market can decide without artificial scarcity.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:17:09
Or rather we can increase to 20MB now and then increase 15% per year from there. This would give us a safe steady growth that will get  us most of the way to VISA scale tx volume. Then extra layers like the lightning network can take us far beyond this.
@_date: 2015-06-17 07:09:39
It seems we are on pretty much the same page on almost all points.
What I would say though is that decentralisation isn't measured in percentage of users running a full node, but rather by the actual number of users running a full node. If the block size limit is kept low, it may very well increase the **percentage** of users running a full node but it is not likely to increase the **number** of users running a full node, whereas growth will.
As you may have noticed, all of my points are related to the growth of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a (decentralised) company and when innovation based companies stop growing, they start to fail.
The fee market you are describing already exists and is working perfectly fine. Sure, wallets could be a bit more intelligent about that but that is up to them to implement.
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:56:54
People are delusional if they think every, or even the majority of users are going to protect their bitcoins by using a chunk of their bandwidth and hdd space. This is and always will be only for enthusiasts, businesses and miners. They will continue to make up a large enough number of nodes if we continue to grow the network.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:23:25
We seem to be on the same page entirely. I have watched this happen every year for years now and I am just getting tired of it, which is why I made this post.
Gavin has been a completely reasonable, guy just making calm informative posts. Taking into account people problems that they have found and adjusting the proposal based on them. Yet the other side (which it has unfortunately become) seems to just attack him personally.
I personally think bitcoin would be fucked without him right now. Satoshi made an excellent decision.

You know for a fact that people are willing to make a compromise on the 20MB amount.


There is a difference between a spike and a constant overflow.


I hate people saying this on reddit but; correlation is not causation. I have not seen any evidence that larger block sizes have caused a decrease in node


No one at all is disagreeing with this point. This IS a kick the can down the road situation to give us more time to actually develop working second layer options. Bitcoin is finally at a point where the news isn't filled with anti-bitcoin stuff and is actually starting to take it seriously. What do you think is going to happen when they get wind of the fact that bitcoin has hit it MAX technical limit of 3tps? The news is going to fill with this information and no one will take it seriously again. This is includes investors, speculators and users.


How about bitcoin's original functionality? Transacting with anyone in the world quickly and cheaply.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:25:57
I keep hearing you say this untenable time travel argument which seems to work on most people. Just because you held an opinion in the past does not mean there is no conflict of interest in the present. This would only be true if every single person's opinion on everything was 100% set in stone forever. They are not. People's opinions can change, which invalidates your argument.
It is possible that you and Peter's belief in a smaller block size limit was was solidified by your conflict of interest. You may not have been so actively against any proposal if not for your business interests.
I am not saying that you are definitely conflicted by your business interests but the possibility of a conflict of interest does exist and your time machine argument doesn't change that.
In saying all this, I respect all the work you have done on bitcoin and you should not take people's disagreement with your position to heart.
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:51:41
I worry that you don't see the serious of the situation your country is in. Neither side is currently budging and there is very little political will for either side back home in their respective countries, which means they can't really give in and make a deal. The chances of a default are significant.
Greece is a beautiful country with lovely people. I lived in Corfu for a while and loved it but Greece has massive problems that haven't been fixed and this is essentially the crux of the issue.
Bitcoin is not going to solve this but it will at least give people an option if they need to get their money out over the weekend and I think a lot people will be looking to do this.

Have you considered the fact that hitting the block size limit first means they can force people on to their solution. I think the lightning network will be an excellent option for people, but it shouldn't be forced on people by artificially limiting bitcoin.

Can you not understand the logical fallacy of saying " I am against it because people are against it"?
People aren't providing technical reasons for increasing the block size limit. Not that I am aware of anyway.
People are simultaneously saying "no one is saying we shouldn't increase the block size limit" and then when asked how and when the answer is simply "no, not now".
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:57:23

No. Block size increases over time. (currently) block size limit does not increase given time. This means that over enough time block size will tend to the block size limit.
Block size does not become equal to the block size limit other than through natural progression.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:54:25
The problem is that the devs on the otherside are refusing to make a single compromise. Gavin already proposed this kind of idea a while ago. This issue has come up year after year for years now and it never gets fixed because of the same people. The proposal is essentially irrelevant to them.
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:48:09
Also, Adam Back (Founder of Blockstream). Although he is not core he is also probably the one making the most noise compared to anyone against raising the block size limit.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:29:46
I understand your point, but this must also be true now. A larger block size without faster propagation could exasperate this though. Again this comes down to 'how much is too much'.
What I hope is that this debate will generate a solution to this problem as people's hand's are forced. The debate should be valuable just for that alone regardless of anyone's position.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:59:58
Actually they have said they don't want to have any block size limit increase for a year or two to maybe 2MB. That's not "We will stick to the old version until there is an agreement among the main developers" that is them deciding what they want and then trying to push bitcoin into this direction.
Do you find it fair that a very small subset of the community (important, yes, but still very small) is able to force bitcoin into a new direction that it was never intended for?
They are able to force bitcoin into a new direction simply by spreading FUD (and this is actually the perfect use case for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) and filibustering any changes until they have the bitcoin they want.
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:58:29
Seriously, what is the point you are trying to make?
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:54:14
Ok, we are getting somewhere. I appreciate your point.
So if I am understanding everything from the 1MB side correctly, what we need to find is a technical solution to certain problems with scaling the block size. One of the major issues being; the increase in orphan blocks due to an increase in propagation times, which will possibly cause an increase in centralisation in mining pools (by some amount). This is due to mining pools having lower propagation times within their network of miners.
Is this correct?
If this is the case, the solution to finding consensus is solving the technical issues as soon as possible so that we have a viable option for increasing the block size limit that both sides of the debate can agree on.
I suggest that what the current best way to achieve this is to create a bounty or set of bounties for someone/some people to find a solution to these issues within a certain amount of time. Considering the scale of the debate that is currently going on and it's importance for everyone involved, it should not be difficult to gather a bounty/bounties large enough to produce an excellent incentive to solve those problems as soon as possible.
If you support this I think it should be easy to find support for this solution to the solution going forward. Lets use bitcoin to fix bitcoin.

It's not being raised 'now'. 
Because there are 5 core devs. It's not particularly difficult for 'most' to disagree. Especially when two of them are working for a company that benefits if the block size limit is kept artificially low at least until after there product is ready for prime time.

This says nothing about whether it was caused by it or not. It was caused by cyprus. There was already a slow upward trend before it started to occur and the Cyprus situation exasperated it.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:19:14
Thanks for such a well thought out response. I would say that is an excellent summary of what the current situation could be.
I feel that over the years people seem to have forgotten how resilient bitcoin is. I remember the many times the big fear of a &gt;51% mining pool. If you remember, every time it got close there was a massive backlash against the offending pool and the size of the pool decreased. This even included the the time GHash went over 51%, there was enormous backlash. It now only has 3%.
51% was by far the biggest bogeyman of bitcoin and now we actually have experience of the market working against this scenario. I expect the same situation with the block size limit. Miners aren't going to do something that is detrimental to bitcoin because they have an incentive not to.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:02:39

These are economic problems which are inherent to Greece. Greece needs to sort their shit out, which in my opinion a default will help with because it will force them to.
Bitcoin can't be taken away by government though which is pretty helpful considering there is quite a high likelihood that the banks are going to be closed from Monday onward.
Edit: I should also add that it also still gives them access to the digital economy while giving them cash if needed by using a service like localbitcoins.com or a similar service.

People don't seem to be understanding the the full situation. 
On wednesday they were closer to an agreement than ever before but they only got to that point by both the Greek and German finances ministers stepping way out past where their MPs and voters back at home are willing to compromise to, and even then they still were not actually *close* to an agreement.
The Greek people are not willing to do what it takes to actually fix their economy and the is no will left in Germany to allow any deal to be made with much compromise.
The current proposal from Greece mainly uses changes in tax to solve their financial problems. This is (rightly) not being accepted as a solution by the ECB and Germany because no one pays any VAT in Greece. I know that from having lived there for a while. Almost everything is done under the table, from doctors to supermarkets. The ECB and Germany want pension reforms because their pension system is totally unsustainable. They have a pension system more generous than most western European countries. For example there is a huge list of 580 jobs types that allow early retirement due to being "dangerous". 
This list includes;
* bakers, 
* hairdressers
* radio and television presenters
* wind instrument musicians
* car washers
* fishmongers
* film developers
* waiters
* cooks
* kitchen staff
If you think it's certain they are going to find a deal this weekend, think again. Even if they do, one side is going to be seriously pissing of their voters back home and if it is Greece then they will simply be voted out of power and we will see this whole scenario happen again.

So the percentage is relevant to speed of propagation and the number is relevant to the security of the network.


So we currently have the problem that propagation is O(n) whereas if we want bitcoin to scale in the long term we need O(1). 
It seems that the block size is proportional to the propagation time i.e. O(n) and O(n) is proportional to the the orphan rate. This is only true though if you ignore time. Technology exponentially progresses with time. As the hardware in the network improves with time, the propagation times will also increase. If the block size increases parallel to the increase in speed of the network then there should be no increase in the orphan rate.
Am I missing something?
Also, are there not O(1) solutions available?

@_date: 2015-06-16 20:45:49
Thanks for explaining for me.
So from my understanding the problem is that without the block reward miners could be incentivised to do something 'bad' to get extra transaction fees.
This seems to ignore two things:
Firstly the block reward in bitcoin is directly linked to the fiat value in bitcoin and bitcoin's fiat is linked to it's utility. If we reduce bitcoin's utility by getting rid of its speed then we limit it's fiat value. This actually exasperates the problem you are describing.
Secondly, if we reduce/limit bitcoin's utility and therefore it's value, users, investors and speculator will very quickly leave bitcoin, reducing the number of transactions and fees. Again this would actually exasperate the problem you are describing.
Finally there is also the situation that is, the problem you have described is not currently applicable as the block reward value is significantly higher than the value of transaction fees.
What you seem to be proposing is a bitcoin that is slow, expensive and unreliable. I can see this situation possibly arriving in 5-10 years if we don't find technological solutions to scaling but there seems to be no reason at all to not scale bitcoin now within limits.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:06:51
Thanks for the well thought out responses.


Sure, but it seems pretty evident that that is the significant minority. I am not saying that the minority should not be listened to but at some point people need to make a decision on how to move forward. No decision is also a decision.


Not everyone agrees with the current monetary system, which is exactly why bitcoin exists. If everyone did agree then there would be no problem. Also to the people who you are actually referring to in that comment; I don't think the average person is "agreeing" to it. Humans are particularly bad at seeing something that is in front of them everyday. It is an unfortunate consequence of how are brain works. They just see the current monetary system as 'how things work'. That's a separate debate though I suppose.


I'm not saying anyone shouldn't say anything. I think people should present their arguments and have them judged the way you are judging mine. My point was that it seems that he is moving the discussion to a place where he thinks he can easier because he doesn't have a particularly strong technical argument against raising the block size limit.


Oh absolutely. It takes time to set things up and make sure we have enough consensus for the fork though.


That depends. If we hit up against the block size limit and the cost and/or time to make a transaction increases significantly this could hurt bitcoin enormously. Gavin isn't trying to sort this out now because he just wants a quick solution for the sake of it. He is trying to do it in a timely manner to make sure it happens in a controlled way that will not destroy faith in bitcoin. This discussion has been happening for years now and same people shut it down, so if you want blame anyone for the situation we are in, you can blame them.


I understand your point, but the situation is less of a technical one and more of a political one. The people on the one 1MB also know this. It is a decision for **what bitcoin should be**. This shouldn't be decided by a few developers in a bubble any more than change to the constitution of a country should be made by a few law makers in a bubble. There are of course technical issues but these are not insurmountable. 


My point is it depends on the situation and the size of the minority. This is not the same as making all black people stand on a bus. It's about deciding freely how a protocol for the internet of money works. The poem you are referencing doesn't seem to be relevant here.


Actually it's "Lets all agree on what I agree on or there is no agreement".


Sure, which is why I said he should make a (good) proposal for a better threshold. He won't though (other than 100%) as that would actually progress the debate, which he is not interested in.


I would say I have a decent understanding but that my understanding is not so relevant because of this one fact; If propagation times become too large and there are more orphaned blocks, miners will simply miner smaller blocks. They will simply balance out block size with profit until they are maximising profit. That is the beauty of the bitcoin mining network, it's not going to do something against it's own interest. Block size will then increase organically as the network hardware improves.




The only way I can see this though is that he is complaining about the way decisions are made because he isn't the one in control of the decisions. He has no issue filibustering the debate until he gets the bitcoin he wants.


The first argument is; increasing the block size limit by any amount above 0 will increase centralisation. As an example that fits within this argument; increasing the block size limit 0.1MB will increase centralisation to the point that there is only one miner in the whole world.
That argument is obviously false. It is not normally presented so explicitly like that so as not to make it so obvious. It is normally presented like; increasing block size limit will mean centralisation therefore NO.


I also thought that it wasn't done on purpose but I just can't see this being true any more. At best they are being disingenuous but, coupled with the fact that they are refusing to compromise and find a solution while constantly making posts like this with no substance, It's difficult come to a different conclusion.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:22:43
All of that sounds very reasonable. The issue I see is that a small group of people intend bitcoin to actual become something VERY different from what bitcoin is now. I imagine it would be very difficult to reconcile when these visions are so fundamentally different.
@_date: 2015-06-26 07:41:38
That's not how marketing works. You market your product before release while constantly building until there is the maximum hyped just as the product is released. If you try and do it any other way people won't give a shit about it.
You of course risk the possibility that your product doesn't live up to expectations, but rather have a set of somewhat disappointed users than no users at all. This is especially true to a product that requires as many users as possible to actually be useful.

I actually agree with you but I don't think we are at that point yet. There needs to be progression made until no more progression can happen. Progressions seems to still be possible therefore it should happen if it is beneficial.
I think this will be the last ever hardfork. I think Gavin believes this too, which is why he and others want the block size limit to increase over time. Otherwise it will never increase again.

I have watched this debate going on for years. The only reason we even have this much progress so far is thanks to Gavin.
A solid consensus can only be had if everyone is willing to compromise. There are currently two completely incompatible ideologies for bitcoin within the core devs. How do you get consensus from that? And if you can't, do we all then just allow bitcoin to be turned into something it was never designed to be because a minority want it to be so?
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:30:25
I would also like to hear some real arguments from people rather than just person attacks and opinions.

100% consensus simply means the minority rules the majority which is just idiotic.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:09:17
Not necessarily. Bigger blocks mean a network with a bigger utility therefore possibly more users and therefore more nodes and a more distributed network. But really there is no way to know for certain. I personally think if bitcoin stays this limited it will never get anywhere and any argument about decentralisation is mostly pointless.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:49:38

Not once in the whole of that mail does it actually address what the issue with raising the block size limit is, other than it would be contentious.
Being contentious without a reason is no argument at all.
This is the tactic; keep saying "contentious" and "risk" until it actually does become contentious and risky. It says risk 28 times in the mail.
Apparently no one is fit to even have an opinion about bitcoin other than (some of) the core devs because we are all too stupid.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:09:52
Unfortunately this is an unrealistic expectation from a system such as bitcoin. You might be able to expect this from a company where there is a hierarchical, top down approach where the people at the bottom just have to put up with any decisions but this is not how a fully decentralised technology like community can work. Bitcoin is NOT just code any more than we are just electrical signals in our brain. Bitcoin is a collection of an extremely diverse set of thing including; miners, developers, users, companies, speculators, retailers etc.
The side of increasing the block size limit has started to push harder as it seems to be becoming more obvious that the people staunchly on the other side of the debate seem to be using stalling tactics to delay the implementation of the solution until their solution is ready for market.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:54:08
You know what is also irresponsible? Trying to make the situation **more contentious** rather than working towards a solution that solves the **current** problem.

Or rather we can increase to 20MB now and then increase 15% per year from there. This would give us a safe steady growth that will get  us most of the way to VISA scale tx volume. Then extra layers like the lightning network can take us far beyond this.
@_date: 2015-06-24 09:52:16
I think this is a discussion worth having. The kind of stuff that is going on above is exactly why Gavin had to take a different approach to increasing the block size limit. I have watched this conversation for years and it was always shutdown in the same way. Gavin understands the importance of solving it soon which is why he didn't give in this time.

Why would you keep your money in a bank right now based on the fact that 'they might not close on Monday'. If you withdraw you lose nothing. If you don't withdraw you could lose an unknown amount. There is only one logical choice.
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:03:08
I think you have missed my point. My point was that if we can increase the nodes in the network by a sizeable amount then there is not much of an argument to make anymore.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:04:42
People don't trust computers (and rightly so). Most people are not going to be comfortable putting their life savings into their computer.
People are stupid and can't be relied upon to secure their own funds. The bitcoin security model allows you to secure your value if you know what you are doing. If you don't, then you have no hope. 
Unlike a lot of people around here, I actually think this is an important use case for banks. They are (generally) extremely good at looking after your funds.
@_date: 2015-06-19 07:10:10
I doubt. Only an idiot would not be withdrawing everything they can right now. The banks are not officially closed yet but there is very large possibility that they will be on Monday.
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:32:39
You obviously haven't been around here for long. This debate has been going on for years and has always been blocked the exact same way. The only reason it has got to this point is that Gavin has finally started to not back down.
Yes, that's a great idea. Lets purposely break bitcoin even though we have a completely viable solution.
You also obviously aren'y listening to the devs on the 1MB side. They aren't budging. They are for no increase at all in the foreseeable future.

The everyman does not need accuracy. He needs simplicity. Bitcoin will never succeed if it is only ever perceived to be useful for someone with a computer science or engineering degree.
Using bit as a denomination makes things a whole lot easy for the average/lower than average user to understand. This is why we are seeing most of the major players move to it.
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:19:41
Technology is by definition neutral. Bitcoin has no values or emotions. It just is. People will and do use it for all manner of things, and that's the point. It doesn't care about your political beliefs. I'm sure this is an unpopular opinion in these parts.
One thing technology does do though is change things. Bitcoin has a huge potential to change how the world works.

Bitcoin adoption is exponential or uber-exponential. In the last two years the price has gone up by roughly 100x. I expect the same increase or more over that timescale. So maybe $100,000 by mid 2016.
I was telling people about the logistic curve that bitcoin will likely follow well over a year ago. It is still following the model (when averaged).
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:56:54

@_date: 2015-06-25 19:07:55
Thanks for you input. I would argue that node centralisation pressure is, at best, unknown since a bigger, better blockchain could increase the **number** of nodes while possibly decreasing the percentage of users vs nodes. The number of nodes seems to be what is important.
With regards to block propagation; can you explain a little more technically why this is problem. Is it just an issue with the bandwidth of the internet in general? i.e. propagation speed is proportional to the available bandwidth of the network. Or is it latency? Is propagation limited to the lowest common denominator? Or possibly something that I am missing? 
I think if people understand the details of the situation a lot better, the community would be able to make a much more informed decision/opinion. Not only that, but having many minds trying to find a solution to a problem will find a solution quicker than fewer.
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:37:46
If this was true then our brain would not be designed to make constant assumptions about everything in the world and be right most of (certainly not all of) the time.
Past performance can of course be inductive of future results. If a child drops a ball 100 times and it it always falls to the ground then they will likely assume that the ball will drop to the ground the 101st time.
I think a more accurate statement would be that; the more evidence we have of past performance the more accurately we can predict future results, but that past performance can never guarantee future results.

This is actually very very important.
When you send bitcoins currently you copy and paste an address/scan a QR code. The only error is normally choosing the wrong/old address.
If you sent bitcoins to a more user-friendly address (e.g. userfriendly it is easy to make a typo. This is potentially a worse problem than sending bitcoins to an incorrect/old address since you at least know where they went and have a chance of getting them back.
I think for user-friendly bitcoin we would need very strict rules for wallet clients for adding contacts. For example, when paying someone a sample micropayment (maybe 1 satoshi) could be sent to 0conf the address first before sending the actual payment. Kind of like a ping to confirm. Once it has been confirmed it can be added to your contact list.

What your seeing is the libertarian side of bitcoin. It is visible less and less compared to the early days of bitcoin but it is always there. You will be attacked in the bitcoin community for holding an opinion that is anything other than libertarian.
It comes from a place of hate against the government. It is the driving force of bitcoin but it will hit a road block at some point because the average person is not so critical of government.
I have yet to hear a good argument for how we can move from a semi-capitalist semi-socialist type society to an ultra-capitalist society without taxes (which seems to be a major. That is not to say there is no way but I have yet to hear one.

The reason why the basics of living should be provided to all is because we want to live in a civilized society, where the amount of money you have does not dictate your survival or success.

I personally would like as many people as possible to enjoy their lives regardless of their wealth or intelligence.

Well using torrents isn't breaking the law though is it. The system of torrenting is not illegal. The system of downloading things that you don't have the copyright for is illegal. I would say this is identical in concept to bitcoin and it's uses.
I would say one major difference though is that torrent technology has struggled to be used for anything other than illegally sharing copyrighted material, whereas bitcoin has already achieved a higher level of legitimacy.

Right now I run a company who employs freelancers around the world.

For this we need a bitcoin friendly bank.
@_date: 2014-07-05 12:44:10
Bitcoin is a decentralised network based currency with very low transaction fees. You can send bitcoins to anyone in the world almost instantly (takes between 0-10 minutes normally depending on certain things). Bitcoins are held at bitcoin addresses and who ever has the (private) key to these addresses can access those bitcoins. You can send an amount from an address you have control of to another address.
What happened in this case was that a person sent a large number of bitcoins to the wrong address. The address was held by a company that had already gone bankrupt and closed down. He then contacted the company and asked for them back, which they did.
Bitcoin is like digital cash in that the transaction are non-reversable so if the person you sent them to is unwilling to return them then this would be difficult to get them back.
Bitcoin will become easier to use as it grows and matures.

If you been around in bitcoin for a while you'll notice after a while that it always exceeds the majority of users expectations. Bitcoin grows exponentially because of socio-economic forces.
I've seen people say it will never hit $10, $50, $100, $200, $500, $1000, $2000. These predictions often even came from people who were bullish on bitcoin. 
Bitcoin's real value moves in a logistic curve rather smoothly (i.e. if you mapped out the bitcoin economy growth and not the bitcoin price). Bitcoin price follows this logistic curve also but in cycles of being above an below it. There have been some interesting articles written about why the price moves and cycles when the actual value of bitcoin moves relatively smoothly.
My prediction (which we can look back on at the end of the year) is that bitcoin will hit $5000-4000 this year but then drop back down to around $3000-2000 after the peak has been hit. Next year we'll hit a peak of around $30,000-40,000 relatively early on I guess.
I could be wrong though.

Yes but I think what jonat3 was trying to say and what Peter Schiff is missing is that saying bitcoin doesn't have "intrinsic value" because it is just digital is the equivalent to saying that gold doesn't have "intrinsic value" because it is just energy.
The problem is with the word "intrinsic". It adds no meaning as either everything has "intrinsic value" or nothing does. A lump of gold has no value to a lion in the same way that a public and private key to 1,000,000bits has no value to an indigenous tribesman in south east Asia.
Both gold and bitcoin have value.

Unfortunately this leads to bankers gambling aggressively with other people's money as they know that they will simply be bailed out by the government/tax payer. The only winner is the bank in this system and unless you want to only ever deal in cash you are forced to use their rigged system. 
This is the very reason why we need bitcoin as an alternative, to move the monetary system from the private bank's interests to the public's interest.

I didn't say bitcoin was more complex than the traditional banking system. I said it was complex. The traditional banking system is equally, if not more, complex. People simply perceive it as less complex because they don't see anything of what goes on inside banks.
I think over time people will come to ignore the background complexities of blockchain currencies as they do traditional currencies today, just as no casual user questions the technology behind email. They just use it.

If they are a liar and don't get results then they will be voted out of their position. That's the point. Currently if public transport costs rise and quality decreases year on year then the person in charge of transport will only lose their job if the top dog decides that this persons results having an effect that is not in the interest of the party. Normally the change is not that he is fired but rather just moved to another position.
We currently have people at the top doing jobs they know little to nothing about simply because their party won a race. People should be voted in based on the experience and kept in or fired based on their results.
This removes dogmatic belief in one set of ideals from the equation and makes sure that a particular job is done well regardless of political beliefs.

As far as I can tell he is not saying people who speculate on bitcoin's price are elitist. He is saying that telling others they have to invest in bitcoin even if they don't have the money to risk is elitist. 
Being able to use bitcoin without needing to be exposed to its volatility is a very important step for bitcoin for this very reason. Not everyone want's to (or can) hold bitcoin and they should not be excluded from the network.

Nope. No they don't. Just because something might be logical does not make it user-friendly. Every argument I have ever heard for using the SI standards ceases to grasp what it takes to make something user-friendly to not only the average person, but also the below average person.
For bitcoin to become anything close to a world currency it needs to be simple to use and understand on the surface.

I have debated with both; people who think it is impossible and, people who think it is easy. Fractional reserve banking is possible, but just more difficult with bitcoin, as there should be a push for bitcoin businesses to be more transparent with funds. The bitcoin businesses who are more transparent are more likely to come out on top therefore lending people's bitcoins out without their permission becomes more difficult.
The only reason fractional reserve banking exists today is because 99.99% don't know that it is the standard.

Even if you include assembly, in China that is only another $5 max. So you are looking at $15 in cost + packing, shipping and tax. They obviously spent their own time designing the hardware and firmware but this is a non reoccurring cost so doesn't have as much impact on the pricing of the product.
I would guess that they could sell this at $50 directly to the customer and still have at least 50% profit margin.
I would assume that they are taking the tactic of having a higher price at first to get sales from people with larger BTC balances since they have a higher need for it. Then once this group is relatively saturated they will cut the cost and go for something closer to the average bitcoiner. I think this is a good tactic but I think it is time to reduce the price by quite a bit now.

I truly hope this to be the case. Bitcoin is the only way out I can ever see for problems we face. I worry though that people who have the most to lose from bitcoin also have the most power and money (currently).
If we are lucky we may find that there is rapid change in power though. As bitcoin increases in value there will be ever more rich and empowered people on the side of bitcoin. Millionaires and billionaires will be created through bitcoin who will have the money to fight the millionaires and billionaires of the other side of the pitch. I think there will be a turning point where the rich and powerful on the other side realise there is likely more to gain by joining the bitcoin side and that the sooner they do the more they will gain (/less they will lose). From there it will be a race to move to bitcoin because no one will want to be left holding the fiat bag.

Your ignoring that bitcoin price is exponential. The price should track up as the btc reward tracks down. This means the real value of the subsidy received by the miners should stay relatively constant until bitcoin slows down from its exponential path.
As far as I am aware (I could be wrong), each block is not anywhere near being completely filled with transactions yet. The more transactions per block the higher the reward is for the miner that mines it. Also as far as I am aware the block size limit can be increased to allow more transactions to happen.
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:57:53

Gavin already proposed this and got even more shit for it than he is getting for the current proposal. The 20Mb limit is a fast and nasty fix to get as much consensus as possible and give us time to find better scaling solutions.


This is pretty much the definition of centralisation and inefficiency. 


High fees in this scenario would simply be a function of article scarcity. This proposal is actually doing exactly what you are asking, which is move closer to a sustainable mining model where they paid using fees rather than just the block reward.


So essentially we would be making bitcoin worse over time.

I didn't say that it does prevent it. It will make banking much more transparent though. We can already see this starting to happen in bitcoin. More and more exchanges are moving to a more transparent model of operation. The more secrecy there is, the more trust is required. The more sharing and openness there is, the less trust is required. 
It also gives people an alternative to using a bank account. This means that if you don't want your money to be lent out (risked) then you can still be part of the global economy.

Hi Mike. I am on yours and Gavins side on this. You provide logical arguments that do not ignore real world factors affecting bitcoin.
There is clearly a large division occurring. How do you think this can be fixed? Most of us see the reality that if bitcoin can't even scale temporarily with a Blocksize increase then user, investor and companies are going to start leaving in droves, possibly even before the fact.
It is clear, for one reason or another, certain members of the community have dug their heels in and a refusing to solve this problem. I have been a part of the bitcoin community since 2011 and I have seen this issue being brought up multiple times over the years and it has always ended with "lets just wait and see".  It's pretty clear to me that this isn't going to end well in one way or the other and right now we need to find the least worst solution. Do you have any thoughts on this?

I have never said anywhere that bitcoin is guaranteed to succeed. I think bitcoin/blockchain technology will likely succeed due to it's (increasing) usefulness. I think the bitcoin price will likely go much higher based on the fact it is currently following a logistic curve, which makes sense.
Your statement says nothing more than "we can know nothing since everything we know happened in the past" which is just useless.

I am also an avid bitcoin supporter but don't agree with the full libertarian view. There is a place for governance and I think it is in making sure your rights are not infringed by other people and also looking after large scale infrastructure (Roads, Water, Power etc.). Currently governments want and have a lot more power than this which is where I think the problems are coming from. Also, the people who are in charge of the infrastructure can only be hired or fired by the president or prime minister. If the population could vote in or vote out the top people in these positions you would essentially create a market structure where the best people are kept and the worst people are fired.

Tell that to GHash.io
I'd really like to hear a legitimate technical argument and evidence of at what point centralisation will increase, by how much and why, due to an increase of the block size limit proportional to bandwidth increases.
I see the biggest problems that people should be looking for solutions for to be; mining pools, ASIC mining. These two things that were never designed for by Satoshi are pretty much the two fundamental things why bitcoin has become less decentralised. Considering how easy it still is to run a full node, I don't see how this could possibly have had a significant effect on the number nodes in the network. Especially when running a full node is pretty much exclusively only something for enthusiasts.
If we can get bitcoin back to the point of CPU only mining which anyone can do and they can receives payouts via a share without pools then we should never have to worry about decentralisation again.

This is true. The dynamics of bitcoin's utility will completely change as fees increase. Although it is very difficult to tell exactly how and when the changes will occur.


This is only true if the price stays the same. Who knows where the price will be next year. Short term trend says the same or lower. Long term trend says higher.


That's a bit unfair, because it's not clear that fees are an ideal market. The recent uptick suggests a market forming, but it's very noisy so I wouldn't want to make that call...
I get what your saying, but it seems the mining subsidy is so large still compared to the transaction fees that miners don't have to care too much what fees people are paying. Like you say, this is starting to change though. The problem I see with this concept in general is that I don't really see how a real free fee market can exist. Bitcoin users have a choice what fee they put on a transaction, but they don't have any choice at all who processes the transaction and receives the fee. It seems to me that, rather than causing fees to go down to the point where it reflects actual costs, fees will rise to whatever point users are willing to pay. This is because; users simply have to pay whatever it takes to get their transaction in the next block OR users have to pay what they are able to pay to get their transaction in any block OR users can't pay and therefore don't send a transaction. Miners will therefore have an incentive to increase fees up to the point where users stop increasing their fee due to the reasons above.
I don't see any particular problem with this since it is paying for the utility rather than paying for the cost. The problem I see is if we start limiting the block size artificially on purpose to drive up fees.
On a side note, do you think that if we could somehow get rid of pools that the problem of mining centralisation pressures with increased block size would go away?
@_date: 2015-08-14 11:19:33

No. **Total** fees must go up. Total fees increase as the number of transactions increase. This has always been the plan until a few people decided they wanted to use a one time opportunity to turn bitcoin into a settlement network.




You don't seem to get how bitcoin works. Miners can include or exclude any valid transaction they like. If a million users each want to send one transaction every day but bitcoin is only capable of handling 500,000 transactions per day, then a minimum of 500,000 users will not be able to use the blockchain.

Some people certainly do. It makes sense to support the network that is providing a utility.


Not necessarily. Miners can set whatever limits/rules they like for including transactions. If all miners decide they want a $0.10 minimum fee then every user will have to pay that regardless of how full blocks are.
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:53:26
It seems to me the problem is not block size. Block size just has the potential to exasperate the real problem is not tackled correctly. The real problem is mining pools. If there were no pools then all major problems would disappear and the network would be fully decentralised.
How do we solve this problem? Is everyone moving to P2Pool enough?

Ok I apologise if this is what you meant.


While I agree with this statement, I disagree with the sentiment. Sending bitcoin transactions should not be free of course. These were initially used as a kind of 'introductory offer' to generate users IMO. Bitcoin should be cheap though.  Most of the introduction of the whitepaper is talking about the high costs involved in the trust model used with traditional banking and credit cards. Why bother to reduce costs if ultimately bitcoin fees would rise to the point of making the trust model savings negligible.


Why would fees in USD value decrease as bitcoin's value increases? I would expect fees per transaction to rise slightly and slowly but total fees to increase exponentially with the number of transactions.

How can you say it is only the average size that matters? If the transaction queue is at any point larger than the block size limit implemented by the successful miner of the block, then there are delays. Essentially what you are saying is that it doesn't matter if we slow down the whole network and reduce bitcoin's utility.

I think the real answer is to do things to improve mining for everyone, and level the playing field. 
This is a good point. I'd say it is bitcoin's biggest failure considering AFAIK Satoshi never envisioned ASICs and mining pools therefore bitcoin has essentially been running in a way that it was never designed for. I know a lot of time has been spent in trying to find a way to disincentivise ASICs without much success but I have a hunch that solving the mining pool problem could be easier.


I very much look forward to reading it. Levelling the playing field could be one of the biggest fixes to Bitcoin since its inception.

It seems the people wanting to make bitcoin into a settlement network don't care about the entire community and economy that has built up around bitcoin. Right now bitcoin is a speculation. If they kill that, then they kill it's chances of becoming something really useful in the future.

Probably the best reply I ever got on reddit. Thank you. I'll look out for that bar next time I am in Tokyo. We normally hang out in Shinjuku so it will be cool to go down to Shibuya to drink for a change.
You explanation of the internals of Gox seems to fit perfectly with how it seemed from the outside back in the day. Everyone seemed to know it was being run like crap but without any other reference point or option for trading people were pretty much stuck with it. Servers were down all the time and generally slow which caused random massive swings in price all the time as people just traded blindly.
I find it such a shame that instead of being a strong leader in a totally new industry, Gox ended up being a huge hinderance and problem for it. I joined the bitcoin community around when you were hired by MtGox and there was very little change in their service in the 3 years after that.
I find it utterly insane that Mark would try and make you CEO without providing financial information. Also investors. Who is going to invest in a company without any financial information.
I can't see any reason at all why he would try to hide the financial information unless there actually was something to hide. It seems instead of finding investors to cover initial losses in a new, potentially highly profitable industry (which is a perfectly acceptable initial business model for a new bitcoin company) he used customer funds to cover expenses and got caught out when the price increased. 
All he had to do was find investors, partners and a capable management team before he committed any crimes, which should have been easy considering Gox's initial monopoly position in the market.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:10:15
Why not all of the above.


Well it depends on what you mean by "scale". If you mean to the amount of all possible conceivable transactions in the future, then no of course not. But it doesn't need to be that. It should be able to scale to be used for pretty standard transactions for everyone on the globe though without being overly expensive or slow. 8GB blocks in 20 years yields around 5 billion transactions per day. So a transaction for every person the planet every day or two without delays or high fees. That seems pretty reasonable to me. LN and SC can be used for all the other applications that require different attributes (faster, cheaper etc.), for example micro-transactions.

If this were true it would mean we would have always had full blocks since the 1MB limit was put in place years ago. The block size has increased naturally over time. Miners can set whatever rules they want on how they include transactions in a block. If they wanted for example they could have a rule that says they will only include transactions with a minimum $0.10 transaction fee. If an "attacker" is paying these fees then he's not really doing an attack. He is just giving a load of money to miners. If he isn't paying these fees then the attack has no effect.
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:42:10
It is not alleged. It is logic. They have an incentive to temporarily and artificially keep the block size limit until their product is ready for prime time. The more pressure there is on the block size the easier it will be to receive funding and the easier it will be to get people to use their product. Also it is beneficially for people to quickly move over to the lightning network rather than continue to use a limited bitcoin.
None of this is opinion. This is just simple logic.

5) Once bitcoin is thoroughly throttled and fees rise to unacceptable levels, find and receive VC funding to 'fix' the problem.
6) Execute lightning network solution during time of high fee pressure so that people move on to the lightning network as quick as possible.
7) Increase block size limit when the lightning network devs decide it is needed.
8) Profit.
My issue is that I genuinely believe bitcoin will be dead before point 5 even happens. Expensive and slow transactions will kill of most of the bitcoin business, a large portion of users will simply leave since this is never what they signed up for, and VC money will dry up as they work out that bitcoin future potential is dropping to zero.

As crazy as this all is, it all kinda makes sense as well.
Having started two of my own companies now, the pressure you are under to perform well is enormous but you cannot run a company in a bubble. A CEO is not, and cannot be, an all knowing god that makes the right decision every time, which means humbly asking for help sometimes can have a massively positive impact on a company. Especially a new growing company. It seems like he made a stupid mistake early on and then rather than seeking help to get out of it, he kept digging deeper.
Keeping track of companies finances is hugely important as well. You really need to know on an almost daily basis what the current situation and vectors are (especially for a financial services company). Your not even really running a business without this information. Like you said, to him it seems this was more just something to do (playing an RPG).
May I ask what you are up to now? I hope you have moved on to something much more productive and fulfilling.
By the way, to return the favour, I have a tip for you (if you still live in Tokyo). The best deal I have ever found in the world is actually in Tokyo. The Park Hyatt hotel has a bar at the top of the shortest building called 'Peak Bar'. Every night between 5pm and 8pm they have a deal there. A 3/4 course meal plus 2 hours nomihodai for 4000Yen. The food is top notch (if a bit fancy for my taste) and the cocktails are some of the best I have ever had. Ask for a table at the window on the west side at 5pm and you will get the most amazing view of the sunset behind Mount Fuji with amazing food and drinks. Considering outside of this special time just a coffee costs around 1600Yen I believe.
The most amazing thing about this deal is that it is never full there. I have no idea how but I think not many people know about it.

@_date: 2015-07-24 10:08:45
This is mostly wrong as it takes things out of context.
As far as I am aware, the only technical argument for not increasing the block size limit (at any time) is that; if the increase in the average block size over time is faster than the increase in network bandwidth then it creates a centralisation pressure on the network proportional to **speed-of-block-size-increase vs speed-of-network-bandwidth-increase**.
Therefore if you make sure **speed-of-block-size-increase = speed-of-network-bandwidth-increase** then there is no problem at all.
This issue has been highly obfuscated by certain people in the debate which is why most people don't actually understand the problem at hand.
Bitcoin can scale proportional to the bandwidth of the network and cost of node performance (e.g. RAM, storage etc.) without any increase in centralisation of nodes. Satoshi even envisaged that centralisation of nodes would be ok over time. 
Consider the fact that the larger the network becomes (more users, more uses etc.) the more big businesses get involved. So even if a smaller **percentage** of users are able to run full node, there could still be a larger or equal **number** of users running a node. But for this to happen bitcoin needs to grow and progress and not stall like it currently is.

Jeff is starting to see the bigger picture here. There are people here who are not as innocent as they would like people to believe. I am glad people are starting to realise this is actually a concerted effort to change bitcoin, hidden behind the fact that all you need to do to achieve it is, freeze the block size limit. In doing so you can (falsely) claim that it was always meant to be this way. Hopefully there are enough of us who have been paying attention the last few years to know this is a complete lie.
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:30:54


This is a lie. 
The original whitepaper suggests that the subsidy will be replaced by an increasing number of transactions and therefore a **larger number** of fees, not a larger fee on each transaction.
As you can see in this chart, total transaction fees have been increasing as expected. From around $200 in Jul 2011 to $8000 Jul 2015 (and we are currently behind the curve due to the lull of the last year and a half). If we take this as the lower bound it would mean by 2019 we would have $320,000 in transaction fees and by 2013 $12,800,000 in transaction fees.

@_date: 2015-07-30 14:20:21
To be clear, I am saying that 2 years ago the block size limit was 1MB but we were at around 0.1MB blocks. We are currently getting close (and sometimes hitting) 1MB blocks. Saying now that "if we increase the block size limit to 8MB no one will be able to run a node" would be as false as saying two years ago "No one will be able to run a node if we allow 1MB blocks).
This is of course not strictly true since bandwidth and computing resources don't improve by a factor of roughly 8 every two years but rather a factor of roughly 2. But since this is a one time change of a factor of 8, it's not an issue.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:44:31
The thing is, I have no problem with a company having a business model based around bitcoin. People just love to ignore the fact that their business plan relies on as many people as possible moving over to the LN as quickly as possible and to achieve this they want to limit the block size to give them time for finish their solution and so that fees rise and people are forced to use it.

I have been around since the first bubble/wave. They popped and crashed and then actually usually stabilised at around 50% of the ATH. So far there have been two serious 'pops' as it were. The first one was of the first bubble where Mt. Gox was hacked and the price temporarily dropped to a few cents. Then Mt. Gox closed for about a week if I remember correctly. This was the first major hack considering that pretty much all transactional volume went through Mt. Gox at the time. This destroyed trust in bitcoin for a long time and the value eventually dropped to just a dollar I believe. The other major fuckup was again Mt. Gox last year. Again this has had the same effect of a long slow decline and general loss of trust in bitcoin. All the other times, when the bubbles popped there were no real underlying reasons to lose trust in bitcoin or its utility so it bounced back much more quickly.
I don't really understand how you can consider this kind of adoption to be anything other than organic. People are greedy and like to increase their holdings without much effort. If the price is increasing rapidly in an asset and has done so in a relatively predictable way, people will want to have that asset. The higher the value of one bitcoin the more utility it has due to extra price stability and extra liquidity in the market. Every time bitcoin doesn't die and then bounces back to a higher market cap it brings in more and more people who have heard about it before and finally realise it probably isn't going to go away.
I have watched the media's perspective change from complete ignorance, to ridicule, to fear, to cautious interest, to interest and finally we seem to be moving into a point of simply acceptance. There is only so many times the media can call bitcoin dead and be wrong until they actually have to have a deep look at it an understand it. Once the media is in full acceptance then the average person will start to begin to trust it without much extra thought. At least over the next 5 years or so. Greed will be the thing that brings users to bitcoin and utility is the thing that will keep them.

Ok, so you are talking about the original loans that Greece frivolously spent on crap that didn't improve their economy at all. For example a ludicrously huge public sector and overly generous pension system.
Even if it wasn't their fault, what was the EU supposed to to do? Well bankers have been assholes so lets fuck everyone to prove a point? The banking system has somewhat improved in Europe since then but I think we can both probably agree that a lot more could be done. This is an entirely different issue though. I mean if we are really looking to place blame on anybody I think there as a pretty good argument that the blame lays almost entirely on the US banking system and not the European, who built up an enormous housing bubble just to pull the rug out from underneath it.
Banks are pretty fucking shit. I have had enough problems with them already to last me a lifetime, but I really don't think they are the main issue any more when it comes to Greece.

Not only that, but also every time the number of queued transactions becomes larger than the block size limit delays occur. This can occur during peak times or simply when a block takes longer than the average 10 minutes, which obviously happens constantly.

Firstly, fuck you, you arrogant prick.


How many financial bitcoin entities currently prove their solvency with bitcoin? I am pretty sure it is close to or equal to zero. We might see it in the future if we ever get to the point where everything is on blockchain but right now it is not possible considering companies have many assets off-chain.


In the bitcoin whitepaper the main points he makes are about reduced transactional cost due to the lower cost of fraud protection. He went to all this trouble of creating a system that is cheaper to use just to have a few people co opt it via a temporary measure he put in to solve a completely different issue, and increase the fees to the point it is useless in it's original intended purpose.

The "I came here first argument" is weak at best, I agree. But quoting Satoshi is important, not because Satoshi is some God we must follow, but rather because it is the social contract that was set out. It has always been known that the block size limit should would increase and that fees should stay low. This was the general understanding throughout the entire community. People are now trying to rewrite history to change bitcoin into something else completely. I never signed up for that and nor did almost anyone else. That's the point he is trying to make, and it is a valid one.

As far as I am aware, miners cannot compete with minimum fee rules, as users cannot select who is mining their transactions. The transaction is just put into the block by whichever miner happens to win the block reward (and accepts your transaction). It means that in a real (not artificially generated) fee market minimum fees will simply rise to whatever the paint point is for the users (i.e. a the point where users will simply not send the transaction because the minimum fee is too high). We don't see this too much right now as the block reward is still very high and transaction fees are somewhat negligible in comparison. A fee market will naturally develop as the block reward decreases.

Do you think you can elaborate a bit more in a technical sense?
What about the argument that; slower block propagation due to larger blocks could cause centralisation pressure on the miners as larger pools will be able to propagate blocks faster than smaller pools.
I agree with OP, I think this is actually a very important set of points to take the discussion forward.

"conflict of interest" is not an opinion or an attack. It is a statement of fact. It is logic. They have an incentive to temporarily and artificially keep the block size limit until their product is ready for prime time. The more pressure there is on the block size the easier it will be to receive funding and the easier it will be to get people to use their product. Also it is beneficially for people to quickly move over to the lightning network rather than continue to use a limited bitcoin.
None of this is opinion. This is just simple logic.

This is just speculation. Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary in nature on purpose so that the block halving was not an issue. The network was meant to grow. (Speculation) If we limit it I don't see the network continuing to grow and therefore the price will not increase and the halving will become a problem.
Not to mention, if what you are saying is true, then we would be hearing miners shouting from the hills that they need higher fees. OR they could just set their own minimum fees, which they are completely capable of doing already. They aren't though because they understand that bitcoin growing is more important right now.


Bitcoin is progressing faster than any other decentralized digital currency, if you have proof of otherwise I'm all ears.

I love it how everyone loves to tell Germans how they should just give all their money away and if they don't or don't want to then they are just evil nazis. 
If Greeks paid their fucking taxes there would literally be no issue here whatsoever. Firstly, they would be properly back on track financially with the extra €13 billion euros a year in Government intake. This would have them on a very strong path to paying their debt off. With this being the case, the rest of Europe would have no problem at all lending them more money in the knowledge that it will safely grow their economy while the debt is still being paid off. 
The current situation is the equivalent to a person not being able to pay his mortgage for 5 years and then then banks go "enough is enough now. You either have to declare bankruptcy and we go our separate ways or you actually sort your finances out and start paying us back". Then the person saying "actually no I don't want to sort my finances out. Also, I've had a vote with my friends and we all decided that not only should I not sort my finances out, but we also need more money. If you don't give it to us then things are going be very bad for your business".
Greeks need some tough love to sort their shit out. Until that happens, just shovelling money at them is not going fix anything. At best it will just delay things. Hopefully the last couple of weeks and next weeks of hardship is enough to actually get them to sort their economy out, but I doubt. It's easier to just blame the evil Germans.

Gavin opposed it, not because he wants a 'fee market' to develop, but rather to allow miners to decide when the soft limit should be lifted. This doesn't say anything about what he feels about the policy change. But we know from other debates what he feels about this policy change.

It won't be by the time we get there. 1MB blocks haven't been full for the entire time the 1MB limit was put in place so there is no indication that 8MB blocks will become full as soon as it is put in place, especially with soft limits.


You have no evidence for this at all. Correlation != causation. There are other just as, if not more, logical explanations. Like the fact there is actually no need to run a full node any more since SPV wallets came about. Its still just as easy to run a full node on pretty much any laptop or PC as it always has been. I only see two viable ways of increasing node count; grow the network and user base and/or implement a direct monetary incentive to run one.


Sure, I agree. But this doesn't really have much to do with the debate as it is already an issue now. From the discussions I have read, I don't really see a problem in simply implementing a limit on the number or UTXOs to stop the enormous dust transactions. Again, this is another debate though.

The sad thing is that if bitcoin dies then all coins die. At least for a very long time. The only reason we are where we are was because bitcoin held and even increased its utility over time. No one is going to trust any altcoin if the most trustworthy coin is destroyed (from the inside).
Even with all the other fuckups in bitcoin I have witnessed since 2011, this is genuinely the closest we have come to destroying it.

[Complete Speculation] I actually believe one of the main incentives behind Adam Back (founder of Blockstream) is that he completely missed the boat with bitcoin. He made nothing from it even though he knew about from really really early on. Day one actually. I think he feels a bit cheated as he thinks that he knows best how it should have been designed being a person who also worked on early digital cash systems yet didn't make anything from it when many people from early on have become multimillionaires. I think possibly he sees this as a way to get out in the lead with bitcoin.
You can here it here on this very interesting interview with him on Let's Talk Bitcoin 
LukeJr's incentive is pretty obviously his hate of spam which, even if misplaced, is possibly the most noble. Although it could possibly be because his internet connection is so poor that is the block size increases too quickly, he won't be able to run a full node on his local network.
Then there is Peter Todd who's agenda is likely that he wants to be able to push through full RBF quicker and have bigger support for his treechains concept.
The others I am not so sure about though. All of this could be complete bullshit though.
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:39:49
Your whole argument is simply; banks=bad.
They didn't create the money out of thin air. They printed money, which inflated the money supply which devalued all euros. I.e. they took from everyone in Europe to be able to stop Greece from destroying the entire economy of Europe. That money that was printed was a lot cheaper than letting the entire economy of Europe take a nose dive.
There is certainly an argument to had over why this happened in the first place, but Greece is in the situation it is through it's own fault. It is the only country that is still completely fucked. Why? because it's population keep voting in parties who refuse to cut spending and who don't collect takes.
Say what you want about the banks, but this situation is almost entirely a political and cultural issue within Greece.

In the UK at least, in 2000 most people (who had internet) had either 28k or 56k and businesses often having 128k. Broadband was just being rolled out that year with 1Mb. In Europe now it is very common to have 20-50Mb connection and in cities we are seeing the first Gigabit connections. This all correlates to a 1000 fold increase in 15 years. Obviously this not a perfectly smooth exponential curve but a 17.7% increase per year seems to be wrong by pretty much any standard you choose.

I agree. Clearly these devs don't give a shit about what bitcoin was originally intended to be, what it actually is currently or what people want it to be. They have diverged from the basics of the bitcoin white paper to suit their own interests.

@_date: 2015-07-21 21:55:25
I have paid attention to bitcoin and the community that surrounds it since 2011 (on a daily basis). No one has assumed or known that a fee market would be developed by putting artificial limits on the blockchain before even the 1MB limit was raised! Not even Satoshi thought this. This goes against the bitcoin whitepaper enormously.

I also have a feeling Adam Back feels the same way. My question would be; if they really felt that, then why would they not create an altcoin that is 'better' than bitcoin and see how well it does. The reality is that they know it is easier to simply co opt bitcoin into what they want rather than create an altcoin and try and get everyone to move onto it.
You reckon you can provide a source for that statement?
@_date: 2015-07-23 09:52:41


You can't offer it as a solution because it doesn't exist yet. 
Bandwidth will increase over time and so can the block size with it. A thousand fold increase over the next 10 years is reasonable. This will get us a long way to what bitcoin needs to be. Not the whole way of course but enough to still allow everyone to transact on bitcoin for the foreseeable future.

By doing whatever they would normally do to make a profit. They are a for-profit company you know? Interestingly I haven't actually seen anywhere what their actual business model is. The best I have seen is "like mozilla". This doesn't really explain anything though since mozilla is essentially just paid by google for searches done through it's browser. This has nothing to do with bitcoin.


I have no idea what you are going on about here. It will be easier to get VC funding if there is a more prominent problem to solve and there is more money to be made from it. If for example their business model is to offer extra services on the lightning network then they will obviously benefit greatly by having more users using it. Having the block size limit artificially kept low temporarily would put pressure on people to move over to the lightning network to save money on fees.
This is a conflict of interest because they are benefitting from keep the block size limit low when a higher limit would actually be better for bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-24 08:13:41
As far as I am aware, the only technical argument for not increasing the block size limit (at any time) is that; if the increase in the average block size over time is faster than the increase in network bandwidth then it creates a centralisation pressure on the network proportional to speed-of-block-size-increase vs speed-of-network-bandwidth-increase. 
Therefore if you make sure speed-of-block-size-increase = speed-of-network-bandwidth-increase then there is no problem at all.

Jeff has caught on to the fact that a set of the core devs are actively blocking any increase to the block size limit to change bitcoin to something very different. They have done this without any discussion or confirmation that this is what people want. It is what they want. They all have their own motives for doing this. They are hiding behind the fact that they are able to change bitcoin by not changing the code. This code was put in place by Satoshi specifically as a **temporary** measure. They are now using this temporary measure to change bitcoin into a different tool and lying to people by saying this is how it was always planned to be. As a long time bitcoiner I can tell you; it NEVER was. This a very specific change of policy by certain devs in the last few months. This is why Jeff is pissed off about it and is now making his thoughts on it public.
@_date: 2015-07-22 06:37:41

I'd like to ask a few questions. I'd really appreciate it if you would answer them.
- Does the Lightning Network, and therefore Blockstream, benefit from having more users?
- Do you think users will have a larger incentive to use the Lightning Network as the fees to use bitcoin increase?
- Do you think fees will increase as more people want to use the network but the block size limit stays the same?
- Do you think users will have as much incentive to use the Lightning Network if the block size limit is increased (in the next year or two)?
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:57:54
You obviously haven't been around that long then or you would know that most of the adoption occurs during the price increase waves. This is by design. There are supposed to be waves of price increases and adoption due to bitcoin's inelastic supply.

You literally gave not a single counter-argument.
I am not 'repeating the caricature of Greece'. I've lived in Greece. They don't pay taxes and there is wide spread corruption. You can see buildings everywhere where the top floor is left unfinished so they don't have to pay tax on the property. You pay for everything in cash and don't receive a receipt, even for doctors.
Those links say that Greece cheated to get into the EU which just supports my case.

It has never been normal for bitcoin to increase 10% in one day after a long period of no movement, other than when something significant was happening. I don't know where this bullshit is coming from that large movements always occurred even during times of low volatility.
10% movements normally only ever occurred when something was actually happening (like right now).

Right, so all enemies of bitcoin need to do is pay for 20% of the network hashing power to stunt it's growth. In fact even less than that since there will be a percentage of the network who thinks it is better for bitcoin to have lower utility as a transaction network.

You don't seem to be understanding that the only reason bitcoin is at around $250 right now, and that companies have invested large sums of money trying to build an ecosystem around it, is based on speculating on what bitcoin could become. Without this bitcoin will become completely useless.
If bitcoin value drops significantly, most miners will stop mining which means the amount of proof of work being done to secure the network will drop significantly. Now you have an insecure network with a large number of unused and cheap-to-buy and easy-to-source machines with the specific capability of being able to 51% the network. Congratulations! You just lost every single utility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:44:27


Funny, you don't provide a single bit of proof. You don't need proof though since this is not something that requires proof. It is self-evident that LN benefits from a (keyword) **TEMPORARILY** smaller block size limit.
A situation where there are more transactions wanted on the network than there is space in the network will not only create fee pressure, but also pressure for transactions to move to off-chain and alt-chain. Guess what LN is. **off-chain**. All things indicate that the number of cryptocurrency transactions will continue to increase, therefore if the block size limit is not increased then these pressures will increase and people will be pressured into alt-chain or off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network. Self-evident.
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:14:02
That gives us a grand total of 1.6MB blocks by 2020. What is the point? 
Oh that's right, stalling tactics.
@_date: 2015-09-04 10:41:56
If the block size limit stays small people are forced into using other solution. It will not harm their chances of creating it but it does mean people will not be forced to use it if the block size limit increases. At least not for a while for normal transactions anyway.

2 scenarios...
1- You pay for electricity using earned fiat and keep all mined bitcoin.
2 - You pay for electricity by converting mined bitcoin to fiat and then convert your (employment) earned fiat into bitcoin.
Answer - nothing. They are identical. You are purchasing bitcoin in both scenarios.
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:46:07
Mike, how do you think we get out of this mess? It seems pretty obvious to most people who have been around a while that bitcoin is being co-opted in broad daylight and history is being rewritten. Regardless of my opinion on that though, the bitcoin community is eating itself. It seems to me the current path ends with no winners as everyone wrestles for control while bitcoin slowly withers into irrelevance.

@_date: 2015-09-04 10:58:08
Mining centralisation is caused almost solely by the fact that if you try to solo mine bitcoin you will never find anything unless you have a large mining farm. This means you HAVE TO use pools. Variance also adds to this effect.
The second thing is ASIC mining which means you can only mine if you invest in specialised hardware rather than everyone being able to use the hashing power they already own in desktop computers and laptops.
These are by far the largest centralisation pressure and I don't see any of these same people screaming about how to solve it. Why? Because it's not as tactically/financially useful problem to solve.

How is it consensus if 79% disagree? 
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:39:29


There is not a single proposal out there that suggests this.
@_date: 2015-09-06 21:52:17
How is that contradictory to what I said?
Bitcoin is a dynamic system where even keeping the code the same can change the dynamic of the network significantly.
What you are suggesting is that, keeping the code the same will always be consensus. I am saying from now on there will be perpetually two choices; keep the code the same, or change the code. Both choices are are conceptually a fork (not in the technical sense) since both options effect the network dynamic. Therefore BIP100 gives 21% power over 79% because keeping the code the same is (potentially) a change to the network dynamic.
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:10:24
Right, but I haven't seen any evidence yet that these are un-solveable which I think means we should put our efforts into solving them. If they were solved block size would not even be an issue.
If there was a way we could adjust reward as a function of hashing efficiency then maybe the playing field could be levelled. I.e. CPU/GPU hashing brought into the realm of profitability again. It wouldn't even matter if ASIC mining was still more profitable as long as people could afford to mine with the hardware they had (i.e. electricity cost).
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:23:24

The only thing I can parse from your comments is that you may seem to think that when I said "flat line" I was somehow referring to the variation in the amount of transaction fees. If you actually understood my comment you would see that it is making the argument that; If OPs statement is correct, fees would have been zero until blocks became full (last few months), which obviously is false. Transaction fees have been there since the inception of bitcoin and have been steadily increasing over time.

False dichotomy. No one is proposing option 1.
@_date: 2015-11-21 11:22:44
Can someone try to answer these questions for me;
- What will be the cost to run a LN hub?
- How can LN be useful for transactions that are close to, equal to or smaller than the miner fee that would have to be paid if a transaction needs to be settled on the network? I.e. If a LN transaction between two parties is say $5 and they can't agree to the transaction (due to fraud etc.), and the fee to a miner is around $5 or higher, surely there is no protection at all since settling on the network will simply absorb the whole transaction. This is true even at lower ratios. For example if the transaction is $5 and the settlement cost is $2.50 I'm pretty sure most people won't be happy only getting 50% of their money back.
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:22:28


Who is asking for everyone to pay zero fees? You're making a straw man argument. This thread is literally about the hundreds of million of dollars in fees the miners could be earning with a suitably scaled network.

@_date: 2015-11-07 12:31:39
This is a follow up thread on the thread I made about the misconception about individual fees needing to increase. I noticed in that thread there were a large number of very obvious logical fallacies being made. It seems relatively clear to me that these were/are being made in bad faith so I thought it would be useful to point them out here so that people can use this thread as a guide on how to respond to them in the future.


No one is advocating for 8GB blocks in the short-term unless you consider 'in 22 years' to be short term. Planning for the future is a necessary requirement of a system that is to be used in the future. For example, Google having a schedule for server upgrades in the future does not mean the server upgrades are happening now.


No one is saying mass adoption is right around the corner. If we are planning for success though (why wouldn't we be) then we must plan for some increase in adoption throughout time though. Adoption is not a binary process where bitcoin has either been adopted or it hasn't. It will occur gradually over time and often in smaller waves due to the nature of bitcoin.


There are multiple fallacies here. Firstly 8MB is a limit and not the actual block size. For almost the entire 7 years of bitcoin's history, blocks have not been full (but have continued to fill up over time). If the block size **limit** is increased to 8MB in 2 months it does not mean that the that the **block size** will be 8MB. We can expect blocks to fill up to the limit over time just as they have done in the past history of bitcoin.
The second is that there is no evidence that 8MB blocks will "massively cull nodes" (when 8MB blocks are reached). If someone can describe what "massively cull" means, and provide specific evidence for that this will happen, it would go towards supporting this kind of statement.


Just because bitcoin with blocks of a certain size cannot handle every possible conceivable transaction across the world does not mean it is not useful. Having larger blocks also does not mean that other solutions cannot also be implemented. Sidechains, higher layer services and off-chain services can all offer useful niche services (with tradeoffs) that bitcoin cannot. Just because bitcoin is not the be-all-and-end-all solution with bigger blocks does not mean that bigger blocks are not useful.


The mining subsidy is decreasing (every halving) in bitcoin terms. In real terms though the subsidy has been increasing over time. You can very easily see this on this [chart](
As bitcoin price has (much) more than doubled in the time between each halving. For example the miner revenue per day around the last block halving (50-&gt;25) was around $50,000. It is now currently at around $1,500,000. So while the block reward in bitcoin terms has decreased by 50%. The block reward in real terms has increased by around 3000%. At a certain point it is certain that the block reward will stop increasing and decrease in real terms as well, but there is no indication this will start any time soon.
There are likely considerably more than this, so if anyone has any serious, logical fallacies (or simply falsehoods) that I haven't mentioned, I will gladly add them.
To have a serious debate we need to stop pushing things are based on false premises just to try and win an argument. I support BIP101 but I could certainly be convinced of a better solution if there is one, but using arguments like I have referenced to above only creates more arguments which provide no outcome other than all parties wasting time and energy.
**EDIT 1:** Here's another one from Theymos.


This is a false premise as it ignores technological progress and the lowering of cost for technology over time. If block size increases at the same speed that the technology needed to process those blocks improves then the cost of processing each block will remain the same.
**EDIT 2:** Here's one from BashCo.


Two fallacies. First, as points out, this is a very clear slippery slope fallacy. There is nothing to indicate that someone who does A will do B. Using the threat of them doing B as a reason against A is the fallacy here.
The second, as points out, is that you cannot attain consensus, or knowledge of consensus, without first people putting their cards on the table.
**EDIT: 3** One from eragmus


libel or slander, including your attempts at both
I'm not the one talking nonsense about 'Blockstream', like you are.
empty attempts at trying to support the destruction of bitcoin
This implies Jeff Garzik is also "trying to support the destruction of bitcoin".
People like you will get whats coming, its already a forgone conclusion, you will be forgotten like the rest of them, your idiocy and attempts at destroying bitcoin will be remembered as a lesson.
So, Garzik will "get whats coming"? Garzik will "be forgotten"? Garzik has "idiocy"? Garzik "will be remembered as a lesson"?
You should stop your verbal diarrhea and stop foaming at the mouth, and try to realize the bullshit you're speaking.
These questions are completely invalid for a huge number of reasons.
You quoted two tweets from Jeff Garzik.




and then you go on to present the question(s)...


Firstly, off-the-bat this is a false dichotomy and the options are not mutually exclusive. Any, all or none of the statements could be true.
As to the actual content of the questions; Neither of Jeff's quotes are pro-blockstream. They against people being overly anti-blockstream. These are not the same thing. Also, there is nothing in his tweets that could even be a "lie" or a "truth" since all they contain is opinions. 
The tweets contain nothing about Jeff's understanding of blockstream, only his opinion of certain people's opinion of blockstream.

Ok, but your opening statement is false.


All I can parse from the rest of the post is; "When bitcoin is no longer volatile it will no longer be volatile".
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:04:47
**Exhibit A:** All of bitcoin's history until the last few months. 
If what you were saying was true (which, by the way, you provide no evidence or reasoning for) then all bitcoin transactions would have been free since bitcoin's first block up to very recently when blocks became full.
[This chart]( would be a flat line along the bottom if your statement was true.
The only reason miners have/had an incentive to allow free transactions before was because the block reward was so huge and because the number of transactions were so low and therefore fees were so low. We have time to increase the number of transactions to replace the block reward without any artificial fee pressure just as has happened the past 7 years.
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:11:49
For the same reason companies like Apple don't just sell at the cheapest price possible. It devalues all your other sales/transactions as people expect that as the price. Miners will find an equilibrium between what they think people will be willing to pay and how many transactions they can process.

It is impossible to know if someone has not done something. This is simply a metric we do not, and never will, have. This is why we have to make out best guess at it and make sure we increase the capacity as much as possible within certain parameters. Not a single person is advocating for a significant amount of centralisation risk.
What we can know though is what it costs to secure the network. As long as enough money is pump into the network it will remain secure from a number of different perspectives.

People are hating on blockstream because they using every underhanded tactic in the book to get their way. A way that happens to be at odds with the vision of bitcoin.
There's no point trying to convince me this isn't what is happening because I have been paying attention to bitcoin and the community every day since 2011. This debate has gone on for years and now it has finally got to the point where blocks are actually full. I don't really know how much more urgent you can get than "yeh the blocks are actually consistently full now". Unless of course you simply *want* blocks to be full. Which coincidentally, blockstream does. You can to that the fact that we are very likely at the beginning of the next price bubble and wave of adoption. It will be the first time in bitcoin's history though where we get 1000s of new users but who have to experience a shitty service.
The only reason Gavin released XT with Mike was because he likely sees as clear as day, like I do, the intention is to force people into using blockstream's software by crippling bitcoin. Also the code Gavin wrote specifically REQUIRED consensus of 75%. So no, it will not split the network unless there was consensus already.

Here are the fees that would need to be paid to keep up with BIP101 (with a minimum fee of $0.05 per transaction) at various static block sizes.
Block size | Fees per Day (BIP101) | FPT (Fees Per Transaction) 1MB | FPT 2MB | FPT 4MB | FPT 8MB
1MB | $12,960.00 | $.05 | $.025 | $.0125 | $.00625

This is true of any block size limit. By this logic the block size limit should be 1kb.


False. Another perpetuated myth. For almost the entirety of bitcoin's existence blocks have have been not full and people paid fees just fine. Also, all miners have to do is set reasonable minimum fee rules and people will pay them. The only reason they are not doing this right now is because the block reward is so large in comparison the amount of fees they would receive because the maximum number of transactions is so small.
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:20:10


The question is presented as "Do you agree or not..." this makes it a binary question since the only answers to it are "yes" or "no" (or "maybe" I suppose). The rest of question simply lays out what it is that you should be agreeing with or not.
I guess we should just leave it though.
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:08:41
Which, if blockstream get there way, could go up to $50 or more which could well be close to, equal to or more than the total transactions amount. The LN completely undermines the bitcoin trust (or rather trustless) model if everyone is forced to use the LN network.

The whole community, including the major bitcoin businesses, need to rally around Gavin if he decides to take this path. IMO no one has more legitimacy in handling bitcoin development than Gavin and bitcoin progressed the most while it was being maintained by him.
I personally think if he does take over he should remove all other changes other than BIP101 and if necessary adjust BIP101 based on the current tests that are going on. I also think it would be worth rebranding the name to give people a smaller attack surface. XT is currently being used as a derogatory term by some of the more obnoxious parts of the community.

Another interesting number you can get from this is; if we are at 8GB blocks and 24,000tps by 2036 **$36 billion** in transaction fees will be going into the network + the block reward + extra contracts made privately. Thats enough to pay 10,000 equally distributed nodes each about $4 million per year (+ whatever the block reward is).

@_date: 2015-11-05 21:46:14
If you look at [this]( chart, you will see that the number of transactions roughly doubles every year. We are now already at the point of having full blocks and we are likely about to have the next wave of user adoption. This means that next year there will already be twice as many transactions wanting to get into the network as there is space in blocks. There is not even anyway of calculating what people will be willing to pay with this kind of congestion but we know that it will either be twice as bad again by 2017 or people will have simply given up on the network.
The plan for LN is not just for micro-transactions. They want the entire network to go through it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:14:27
Without any efficiency improvements to the network to fit more transaction into each MB of block, 8GB would achieve around 24,000 transactions per second or 14.4 million transactions per block. If every one of those transactions pays a minimum fee of $0.10 then the mining network will be receiving $1.44 million per block or $207,360,000 per day.
Currently the block rewards at 25BTC are only paying out $9500.
So per block $9500 vs 1.44 million using a simple fee of $0.10 per transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:52:16

It's not about necessity or cost. It's about whether it can happen.
Currently with bitcoin if a government entity shuts down miners in (for example) Brazil. That doesn't mean shit for the rest of the network or the network that is run over tor, since it will carry on like nothing is happening.
If a LN node is forced to abide by certain rules of the local government then the users of that node simply have to abide by those rule.

The thing is, they aren't twisting the rules of the network. The code allows this therefore this isn't 'against the rules'. Actually what is happening is that due to the artificially imposed limit that is being held in place against market forces, new market dynamics are emerging.

I suggest you see my thread [HERE](
At 8GB blocks, without efficiency improvements, bitcoin will be able to handle 57,344tps. Current average non-cash tps globally is 12,357tps. Average non-cash transactions increase by around 7% per year. This would mean that by year 2040 it would be 67,067tps. That means that Bitcoin would be able to handle over 85% of ALL non-cash transactions globally. Add sidechains, altcoins, offchain and second layer networks like LN and you have more then enough capacity for every transaction on the planet and more.

What people don't seem to understand is that if we want bitcoin to become anything more than a nerds wet dream but still keep as much of its value proposition as possible then we need to tackle regulation and public perception head on.
Bitcoin businesses will (most of the time) not exist in a bubble. They will exist in a country where it will have to abide by the laws and regulations if it wants to not be put out of business. Regulation is going to happen because billions of dollars in value are being moved around using bitcoin. We either let them decide what bitcoin is and how to regulate it from an outside perspective or from an inner perspective (how we see it). Essentially they will regulate it, with or without us.
People can keep pushing this "honey badger" bullshit but I can bet my life on that bitcoin will be destroyed if bitcoin is essentially banned from a business perspective in the EU and US.
The people who require absolutely zero governmental oversight can just buy a miner a get BTC that way. 90% of users aren't going to care about showing their ID to buy or sell bitcoin anyway. The current popular exchanges are evidence of that already.

(1) this is not an argument unless you can show that there is a type of memory that **exists** or **can exist** that has a negative impact on this solution. Otherwise we might as well be arguing about fairies who appear I'm the future and attack all bitcoin miners.

He's not talking about shortages. He's talking about the negative ecological impacts of burning it in the first place. The free market doesn't put a value on ecology currently. It only puts a cost on regulation which could be said to be in some way proportional to the value of the ecology (obviously this is not true though as the ecology is still being exploited in varying degrees today).

You obviously haven't been through "a few bubbles" if you don't understand how they work. Give me a reason for the previous 4 parabolic bubbles.
Unless you have some mind tracking chip inside the brain of every person buying or selling bitcoin, it is impossible to prove exactly why the price is moving. That doesn't mean that it is moving for no reason though.


What kind of comment is that anyway? It almost seems like you don't want the price to go up.

No one was ever claiming that. The same morons keep getting upvoted though for spouting this nonsense. The spring 2013 bubble was caused by Cyprus, just not by people in Cyprus buying bitcoin. It was people speculating on another financial meltdown in Europe. This was not a controversial thing to think back when it was happening because literally everyone was talking about it back then.

There is no point in trying to argue with people in here about this. They are mostly ancaps and libertarians who only see "being able to pay for illegal shit" as bitcoins most important use case. Of course, this was never the original vision if you read the white paper but that's what they think it is.
For them;
- Breaking the law = good
- Following law = stupid statist.
- Company = they just want profit, fuck them!
They'd happily see bitcoin stay as big as it is (or even smaller) just to be able to buy some weed from the internet. They don't see the bigger picture.

There are two EXTREMELY important properties of the price bubbles. Both of them help enormously in increasing bitcoin's utility.
1. The biggest waves of adoption always happen during the price bubbles. That's because this is the time when bitcoin gets the most media exposure. It is also the time people are most likely to buy and therefore learn about bitcoin. Greed. Once people already have bitcoin then it is easier to build successful and profitable services on top of it.
2. The higher the market cap of bitcoin ( i.e. the higher the per bitcoin price) the more users there are, the more difficult it is to move the price up or down, and the more people and companies are financially invested in making sure bitcoin survives and thrives.

I absolutely agree with pretty much everything you've said. It was much better back then IMO. 
I don't necessarily agree that there are more trolls now though. I think there are much more ingrained and diverse beliefs now which ends up causing a lot of arguments. I also think there has been a lot of watering down of the original community (obviously) and watering down/weakening of the original vision behind bitcoin.

All sorts of underhanded tactics have been used to get what they wanted. 
- Censorship of the main bitcoin forums. 
- Spoofing emails from Satoshi. 
- Requests to have people fired from their positions. 
- Support for DDOS attacks against legitimate software and miners.
- Purchasing of the majority of the core developers.
If it takes all that to get your way, then your probably on the 'wrong' side.

Thanks for having a reasonable conversation with me. A lot of people haven't realised what I wrote either.
Going back to the Apple/iPhone example (it's not perfect example because there are different market forces at play, but it illustrates my point reasonably well). Apple could theoretically reduce the cost of an iPhone by say 30% and still be in profit AND sell more iphones as it absorbs some of the cheaper Android phone sales. When it does this though it reduces the price for everyone since it cannot sell the same phone at two different price points. This is similar to miners who for example could reduce their minimum fee from say $0.10 to $0.05 and they would then get all the users who are only willing to pay $0.05 but this also means that those users who were willing to pay $0.10 can now get away just paying $0.05. I would argue that miners have no incentive to does any more than apple has an incentive to do this. IMO an equilibrium will be found between the user's and miner's interests regardless block size limit.

All the last bubbles/waves started **before** the trend picked up. Why? Because price increases first, then the media catch on, then the big wave of adoption occurs as people find out about a bitcoin that is not only not dead but is increasing significantly in price. It's the same every time.
Edit: Then of course the price drops back down to reasonable levels after the peak and all the media outlets declare bitcoin is dead, and the cycle goes on.

There are actually 2.1 quadrillion (2.1 thousand billion) monetary units (satoshis) i.e. Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million Satoshis. So, more than enough for the entire world.

This is not correct. The mining market is not free in this sense since users cannot 'choose' which miner mines their block. Blocks are created by the person who happens to win the reward. Users can't 'shop' for a miner. If Antpool has a minimum fee requirement of $0.10 and you put a fee of $0.05 you can calculate that your chances of ever being included in a block have just decreased by 22% (current Antpool percentage hashrate of the network).

You don't seem to understand how bitcoin works nor what 'decentralisation' is and why we want it. 
Bitcoin price and adoption is directly related to the 'strength' of the network. The more it is worth and the more users it has, the more people/companies there are looking out for it and building on it (including running nodes and mining).
Decentralisation is just one (not well defined) factor in a highly complex system. You can't just turn the 'decentralisation' factor up to 'improve' the network.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:35:28
If miners implement something like a $0.10 minimum fee per transaction (which they will as the network becomes more and more congested) and a company wants to put 1,000,000 transactions on the blockchain per day, then that means $100,000 is being given to miners each day. This increase the reward which incentivises more hashing power and therefore more network security.
We want as many people transacting on the blockchain for as many different uses as possible.
@_date: 2015-11-04 09:54:32
Firstly, there were bubbles in 2013. The second bubble was caused by China. This bullshit about a bot has got to stop. There is no evidence a bot was increasing the price.

1 billion transactions daily is currently roughly the total number of all non-cash transactions happening world wide. It will take years, if not decades to reach this level of adoption and in this time enormous technological progress will happen that will easily allow 4GB blocks on a normal home computer, on a normal home internet connection.
Current trends of technological progress indicate we should be capable of processing this many transaction in around 20 years.

No you have it backwards because you do not understand how bitcoin works as a whole system. 
If the tokens (bitcoins) do not have any value then there will not be a lot of energy/hashing power expended to mine the coins and therefore secure the network. If the network is not secure then it cannot be relied upon for anything, including blockchain tech (rather than bitcoin tech).

Multiple reasons.
- More transactions and money going to miners means more hashing power. More hashing power means more security. More security means more utility. More utility means a higher price.
- The more companies and people that are transacting on the blockchain means the more people there are that have an incentive to invest in it, protect it and promote it.

What LN is proposing is simply not bitcoin. I absolutely think it is necessary for micro-transactions and transactions that need to done instantly between parties that often make transactions between each other. But normal P2P transactions need to stay on the main chain.
Otherwise bitcoin goes from an P2P network to a P2LN2P network. We have 7 years of experience of bitcoin being a P2P network and it works extremely well, why fix what isn't broken?

You're not getting it. Governments can't regulate bitcoin any more than they can regulate torrents or encryption. What they can regulate though is companies. Companies **have** to operate within the law and regulations.
If you don't want there to be any bitcoin companies at all, other than maybe in Somalia, then a good way to do that is to just stick your middle finger up at the government. Of course, I'm aware a lot of the ancap people in the community would like that but most people would not, including every single bitcoin company.
I'd make a counter argument to you; if bitcoin can't operate successfully within and around government entities then it will not be useful for anything other than illegal services like DNMs. DNMs are useful for a TINY segment of the global population. A global currency on the other hand could be useful to every single person in the world. We will never get there though is organisations don't exist.

Then your not understanding how 'Proof of Work' works. If it is easy/cheap for someone to obtain at least 51% of the hashing power of the network then the network is not secure. We want the hashing power of the network to be as big as possible so that it is as secure as possible. The only thing that incentivises people to mine is the value of the coins they receive as a reward. They higher the value of the coins the more hashing power is paid for.
Without a high value coin there will not be enough hashing power to secure the network, and without a secure network you cannot have other applications built on the blockchain. 
No bitcoin = no irreversible data = no blockchain tech.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:39:01

Technically you don't/won't need interest since bitcoin is/will be a deflationary currency while all others are inflationary. This obviously will only become more prevalent as price stabilises though.
Another use is absolute security.
