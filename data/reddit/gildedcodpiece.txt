This past bull/bear cycle has changed the landscape permanently. The extremely wealthy now hold most of the bitcoin, and the price fluctuates with their wants/needs/desires/shenanigans. Got a problem with that? But some back.

Bitcoin inhales the value of the alts and floats higher. It exhales alt season. And then it crashes to a higher low. Rinse repeat.

Depends on your style. I buy when people on reddit are crying and sell off a little when it rebounds. Then repeat. But if you're not going to actively trade, it's probably not a bad time since we just got through a big fake news FUD cycle and it's looking calmer out there. If you're not sure, just spread it out over multiple buys and dollar cost average it out.

Real estate rental income is 'unstoppable.' Bitcoin is a currency we don't have a normalized value for yet. 
Anyone who's got to a few million fiat worth of crypto would be well advised to think about diversifying into some income producing assets. And then let tenants pay in BTC...

Mostly because there was no legit reason for it to have taken off to the moon like it did this year. THAT if anything was a big warning sign, more so than it pulling back. For a variety of technical reasons I think it should have come back to test the $3k level. Isn't it supposed to be a CURRENCY? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:07:16
Agreed, albeit a highly speculative investment. I hold about 5% of my portfolio in crypto and it's the speculative bit. I think a currency like bitcoin was a long time in the making. I am attracted mostly by the reliable price swings and relative security one can have (if properly implemented) over ones assets and transactions. However, I think many will be burned and 95% of cryptos are what we used to call "vaporware" in the dot-com days. I believe in crypto's future, but not in anyone trying to predict how any part of the market is going to turn out or what price some coin will be next month. I think 80% BTC, ETH and max 20% alts is probably the safest bet (for now). But now with so many people buying in on the news of nuveau-riche HODLers and 1000s of upcoming 'ICOs' for the whales to pump and dump, we're really just at the beginning of the chaos before a dominant transactional model rises from the ashes of what's yet to come. 
All this s*it is great for day traders though.

At Chase Private Client (which you can easily get by having half a million dollars) there are pretty much no banking fees for anything and you get minions who do your banking bidding with a phone call. 
But the IRS still knows all your movements. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:26:40
Answer is: use Gemini for USD deposits, but BTC and send to other exchanges. For GBP and EUR, Kraken and Coinbase.

This is true. They were one of the best contra-indicators for swing trading the last cycle.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:06:44
I would say it's a mix of the wash trading - as you suggest - and public market price discovery. Public markets are what the big money want to scalp and they do so using narrative as the opportunity. 
What we just saw was the Consensus 2019 scalp. That conference trends to jack up the market full of optimism. Then the money makes a few moves. Some people buy. Some people sell and the HODLers get more chips for the next round.
As a rule of thumb, it's best to be buying in this accumulation phase of the cycle with a plan to take profits when the fake news cycle and Reddit memes kick up to a frenzy level of 11.
Or you can just ignore the hype cycle and DCA with the hopes that your bags will grow into wealth. They just might.
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:46:48
Gold still has that x-factor of a somewhat unknown supply. While banks will likely try with Bitcoin,  anyone can work out the numbers they need to on a napkin, as it's so formulaic. And anyone can see where it's all physically held and discount a bank's holdings appropriately. 
But I can't wait to see them try. It will only validate the asset and make me richer.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:16:31
Your options are basically Gemini or Coinbase for a reliable fiat onramp. Gemini was the better option but just recently jacked up their fees and dumbed down the interface so you can't place limit orders. 
Keep them on a Ledger nano and put that in a safe somwhere with the seed phrase in a different safe.
If you're a HNWI you can alternately buy into Pantera's bitcoin fund, which is fairly reasonably priced fee-wise and may protect you from yourself.

Can’t tell if it’s making a bull flag or a bear flag. So let’s just say it’s in a HODLing pattern.

Agreed. But by then, I think, it will be too late.

I wonder if Wall Street will even know what to do with Bitcoin. Every one of them can be traced and you can't just ask the FED for more when your derivative products blow up. 
Not to say they won't try to introduce levered derivatives and fractional reserve products. But with the "physical" Bitcoin so easy to send and store, it's hard to imagine the premiums getting out of control except in the beginning. 
I could see a really great selling opportunity resulting from Wall Street's first real forray, followed by the final reasonable buying opportunity.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:37:24
Looking forward to it. Second chance to swap my bags for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:03:05
What are the fees on the ETF going to be? Anyhow, it took copper seven years to get its own ETF approved and it's been around since the dawn of time. I really am not holding out for a bitcoin ETF in the next year. 
Premium is 29%. Yep it's ridiculous. But I'm in it for the uncorrected alpha, not the intrinsic value. I have a Gemini account and cold wallet for that.

We are in accumulation now. This is where the last weak hands are “getting out while they still can” on the up-swings and more experienced investors are buying on the down legs. It should establish consistently higher lows in an upward accumulation channel. 
By the time retail investors’ confidence is back we’ll be pretty far along. Then the next bull should kick off.

I keep my bitcoin at arms length. Never on exchange. I also don't sell any. I try also not to buy too much because I don't want to create an environment when I might feel like I need to liquidate it for some reason.
And beyond all, it's not the price of bitcoin I'm interested in. It's controlling as much of the stuff as my meager means will allow. 
But I don't know if I really qualify as a fat holder. I'm a moderated experienced and extremely well diversified investor.

Capitulation really looks like it happened in November in that last downdraft below 6k. That was the "trough" that we're now getting out of. Total crash 84%. Previous bear bottomed at -85%. One before that, I think -87%?
I think we can buy with conviction anywhere around these levels.
I'm not worried about bitcoin. Don't know if alts will be able to keep up though. Most of them were created by crap teams and serve little purpose.

That's still not the point. The gold vs bitcoin debate is silly in essence. Obviously bitcoin is the superior tool for the modern age and obviously gold has the broadest acceptance and longest history as money-and-or-store-of-value. Those are the facts and debate changes nothing. 
The fact is, they will coexist. It's like cheerleading Coke vs Pepsi. The thought that bitcoin will outright replace gold is laughable.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:20:02
