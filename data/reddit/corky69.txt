yeah i am aware ya dingus, 
i was more or less anticipating the continued circle jerk this sub is infamous for.  
Should it cross 300 I am interested to see how it falls and would be concerned if I held a piece of it.

speculation is something that is done constantly here in terms of how this currency is going to climb, yet the mention of the opposite people clamp up like it is 'that which we dont speak of'

ok say once it catches on and you have a more stable currency, even then what happens when swings start and there is no Fed to regulate interest rates and buy or sell bonds?
you are perfectly ok with saving your money in a way which it could be worth half the work you did for it, simply because there was no regulation?   
what you hope for is going to be the very downfall of the Bitcoin, in my opinion.
Why don't you just buy shit with cash or those disposable Visa cards?

Your saying you arent holding onto it to make money? 
So is it more about the hope for decentralized currency?

Very high fees are the same thing as 'totally volatile currency'  and at least they are predictable.  
And hoping somebody doesn't hamstring you by taking all your money is covered pretty well by the insurance company, which, yes, would be unnecessary with bitcoins.
But you only cherry picked the end of my comment.  Are you comfortable in using a currency that has no sort of safe guard on the ebb and flows of a consumer market?  how comfortable do you feel storing your money in there?
the only thing it is backed by is demand.  The dollar might not be on a strict gold backing any more but there is some capital behind it.

so you have no concern for the downturn of this swing? or is this finally gonna be the one that just goes up! up! Up!

i dont really keep track at all, nor do i have anything invested.  I'm just an econ grad that likes to look at these kinda things from time to time. 
So when i see a 25% increase in a week, thats something that gets my attention.  And if i were invested in this market somethign that would cause me some concern.   
This whole 'wait and see' tactic has been on the losing side of this market since the start of 2014 lest a nice bump in May.  Just trying to see a true conversation on here that includes the possibilities of the downside, rather than fanfare on why  this will work in time when the empirical data says otherwise.
