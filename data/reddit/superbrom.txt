Sorry I'm a bit late to comment but for every bitcoin transaction you need a buyer and a seller. So to sell off bitcoins you need to find a buyer. Why would MtGox require funds? I'm genuinely curious here.

Dude, it's money. The whole world runs on it. Don't worry about making it.

You can use virtual credit cards for this purpose. Sounds dodgy but isn't. I use entropay.com.

Am I missing something here? How would this work in terms of Bitcoin when every transaction is logged on the block?

I don't claim to be an expert on bitcoin so I'm only looking to comprehend your argument. Surely logic would entail it doesn't matter why the order changed hands just that it did. Hence if you see a larger volume of orders taking place on the block then you can establish that a large sale is occurring. Granted, you can prevent these being seen on MtGox but not all of bitcoin.

Also, you need to redesign your website. Anything would be better than the present one. Further, you need to put your best works of art (the city scapes and birth of venus sketch) at the top of the page. I didn't realise you had any skill until I scrolled down; maybe some high def shots of the city scapes would be useful. Really good work though man. 
P.S I would advise you to make only a select few of the same sketch. It makes them more collectible and makes people feel like they have something unique.
