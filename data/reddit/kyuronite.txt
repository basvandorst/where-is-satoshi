well, that's because you offer is really shitty (credit card = worst possible) and a very small amount. If you want to buy btc, you can try an interact e-transfer.

There was a serious neglect here. Sure, you can find my name and house from google maps, but if by telling the world that this guy with potentially 500+ million is going to remain anonymous you have some serious issues. His face, home, and even his license plate is publicly posted now. 
        
Even if he doesn't have a private key for the bitcoins, he's now going to be hounded by everybody from worshippers to journalists to being under surveillance by government agents. What the journalist did is just **plain wrong and justifying it with "the truth" isn't going to cut it.**

I was pro-circle before, but not anymore.
        
 My account was locked and disabled for suspicions that i did a restricted activities in their terms of use. I was not gambling nor sending money to non-intended recipients and using it as a way to receive and send funds to friends. I was using Circle since it was available and they increased my limits when i requested them before. 
         
They did question me of the sources of my funds and asked me to fill out a small form, but i am familiar with KYC and AML regulations and complied. However, after they locked my account, i sent in a ticket and asked them why and they decidedly disabled my account saying i did a restricted activity even though i didn't and ignored all subsequent emails or any subsequent requests for clarification afterwards. It's great that circle is trying a lot to help the bitcoin space, but i have taken my btc to coinbase and other exchanges (bitfinex, btcchina, etc) and would probably never recommend circle to anyone else due to this experience. They have full rights to choose with whom they do business with.
       
They did lock my account but thankfully allowed me to withdraw my BTC balance before fully disabling my account.

One of the reasons why i dont use it. Paypal doesnt really state it in their policy but credit cards allow chargebacks up to 180 days meaning paypal wont suck up the chargeback losses for you. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:24:11
I have a friend who sold diablo 3 gold for cash. He gets chargebacks on 50% of his paypal transactions and his bitcoin price is half of the paypal price. 
     
      
tldr; Chargebacks are a bitch and a headache to EVERYBODY involved. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:36:32
Any fees are usually passed on from the merchant to YOU. Credit cards charge merchants 2% and also allow chargebacks. Chargebacks increases the costs to merchants by quite a bit depending on the business they're in as well as creates much more headaches and valuable time wasted. With bitcoin, it would be a fraction of that price and so a discount is possible, not to mention cost savings and no chargebacks possible. It doesn't necessarily mean the price will change, it does mean that the merchant can charge a lesser dollar figure and still get more out of it. I'm trying to explain it to you as you seem misinformed, you don't have to be all haughty about it.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:44:28
Agreed. I did take an extreme case, but usually with a chargeback, you're losing 100% of what you could've gained and you're also spent with hours providing the case to deal with the chargeback. What kind of niche?
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:43:28
Again, check into the willy bot and mtgox paper. 
       
All you need to do is create the hype, have people buy into the hype and then dump on them while they're there and then rake in the cash. 
     
To summarize, Willy bot kept buying up tons and tons of BTC and manipulated the price past 1k USD. People bought it. Price soared and stayed at that level for weeks. You also don't have to individually sell either, you can just sell at a "discount" to private bidders and sell the thousands of manipulated coins at a 20% market price and still come up on top.

@_date: 2015-01-05 17:08:57
you are right as the volatility increases, the price will go down more. But for corporations who deal primarily with bitcoin, they need to also have a reserve as well. As more adoption happens, trust and faith in the currency will hopefully occur and we will be at a point where the merchants HOLD part of the transaction in BTC.

If you have 1 fraudulent transfer, it is up to the exchange to ensure that the person they are dealing with is actually the person that has submitted their info. I can easily upload funds via wire or even just have Coinbase/Circle credit my account for funds on a BTC purchase. Same can be said and done for QuadrigaCX.

The problem is you need to ATTRACT millions worth of Bitcoin businesses to the region to spark economic activity. 
       
There is no infrastructure or anything of the sort in place. This undertaking cannot happen overnight and putin_vor is trying to point that out to you. Plus, the government has no ability to put in any funds to stimulate the economy. There are none. As for accepting bitcoin, how do you propose that enters into the people's wallets? The bank has the majority of the funds and they're bankrupt and the government is too. Businesses are coming to a standstill because they can't pay their workers since it's just circulating within Greece's internal system. And providing legal protection will take time in any case to do.
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:22:48
That sounds like a recipe for disaster as people aren't as technologically savvy as you. I have tried teaching it to a few people and those without any technological background couldn't even comprehend how it would work. Maybe the earlier generations, but greece isn't exactly a spring chicken in terms of age.
       
"Provide legal protection and the companies will come with their wealth" takes TIME (a company move takes months to plan). You're not going to see a company immediately just start doing business in Greece. And if the company does come to Greece or local businesses suddenly start accepting BTC, how does the regular consumer get the Bitcoin to BUY/PAY in the first place? It's a small stream effect and there needs to be a flood right now. Keep in mind, the VAST overwhelming majority of bitcoin companies are small, after all, bitcoin's only been in effect for less than a decade. You have companies in the world that are worth billions and trillions. The best we've got is a hundred million. It could be adopted in a few parts of greece and sure, we can run it as a parallel experiment, but greece politicians have to be 'on board' with that and they don't really have a good track record for transparency and looking out for their country.

You cannot simply send money from one country to another. The time it takes, thr amount of intermediary banks and even the fx rates, and government sanctions can render a $1000 send to be received in 5-10 business days and you get back 800. Western union's entire business model gouges their customers with those fx fees and the limits of sending. Crypto has none of those issues. Though you have volatility of the price. But if your national currency has an inflation of 9million a year, you hardly have no reason not to go crypto.

They can probably have a bank account in another country, but those are usually due to their unique circumstances. Meaning a person who has never been able to leave their country is effectively unable to open a bank account in another country without either being in that country themselves or having a business that allows them to transact internationally (which is almost impossible due to sanctions).
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:47:56

P2P. Relatives. A lot of these countries with problems of receiving stable fiat currency may also have sanctions on them as well, making it impossible for the general populace to reach. But bitcoin and other cryptos are borderless, allowing people to circumvent those and to use the crypto to buy what they need.

You should really look at the LATAM countries and tell them that their inflation is a feature and not a bug.
         
Inflation of 2-3% is not too noticeable over a few years. Inflation of 2-3% after 70+ years is when effects really start to show and guess what, it's pretty apparent now. Prices of everything is going up quicker. Inflation is a tax of savings. There is no incentive to save if you know your money will be worth less in the future. An economy without savings will be pretty stuck.
        
Also, you dont necessarily get more money because inflation is going up. Most people get an adjustment after inflation has already taken its toll. There is a gap of when you get more dollars versus the inflation rate and your wages are trying to play catch-up.

That article's huge caveat is that the US dollar is in demand. That's a huge fucking if. Read properly and think.
         
Currency devaluation and government collapse are not the same as bankruptcy or insolvency.
       
The US is spending its future. Eventually, the bills will come in. Like anybody who splurges on their credit card, short term pleasure is paid for with long term pain. To consider it differently for a country just because it has a huge ability to spend doesn't make it any different.
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:30:10
The fact that you can't see that the global debt crisis is growing steadily. US is borrowing more, it's debt ceiling has to be continuously raised because there is no backing for the USD. Countries are slowly moving away from the USD as a standard. Currencies are not "backed" by the US Dollar, find me any reliable source that tells you that behind the country is the US Government backing its value. That's complete bullshit. You're bloody dreaming if you think it's all A-OK for things to continue as it is. Just because the other FIAT currencies are in high demand NOW (who's actually demanding them is another whole question), doesn't mean they will be later. If you look at what is happening in many countries; there are over 4 billion people in the world that have no access to banking system. They are regulated out, locked out or even just simply priced out.
         
USA creating debt only to cancel it out doesn't make any sort of sense at all. They have to pay INTEREST, something you don't seem to understand even that concept. If they have to pay interest, then it means that they have to PRINT more in order to make up for it. However, if you're forced to print more to pay the interest within the future, then you're slowly taking the money from tomorrow to pay for today. It also, by the way, makes borrowers win and lenders lose because it means that borrowers end up paying less real money value back.
Nobody is saying the "end is nigh". It's not the end, the world will still continue. And you can rate bitcoin since its inception, it's doing pretty fucking well considering it's only 10 years old.
         
Learn some basic economy because a country can't fucking get out of its debt by printing more money to cancel it out. Shit doesn't work that way long term and you're idiot to even fully

Point is, it doesnt make a difference if somebody swoops into the final moments to make the huge bet to have a 99% chance to win the pot as long as the expected profit will make them lose in the long run. It is fine to allow them as they put up a fair amount of capital equal to the amount of risk that they take. The small guy takes the exact same risk as he doesnt even know who the other buyers are either.

With prices constantly deflating the value of their money, the governments are forced to start bringing higher denominations and if they don't people have to lug around piles of money when hyper inflation hits.

He's an idiot. First of all, BC has a limited amount of supply that is slowly decreasing until it reaches the max supply at 2040. The point of him having the supply continuously increasing therefore means prices will drop makes no sense. Demand does not stay stagnant and the bitcoin market is still fairly young. It has not reached saturation point. There is many places where Bitcoin can improve.
       
If demand increases greater than the supply, then you will see the price rise. Also, the 'supply of bitcoins' is not simply the 'supply of bitcoins obtained through mining'.

New methods are being looked at to increase this and fix the problem. It's a work in progress. Power consumption is pretty fucking cheap. All you need is electricity and the processing power. You don't need buildings, you don't need people to handle the network, you don't need any call centers etc.
        
5) Just because you have never heard of a family or friend having their bank forfeited, it doesn't mean it does not happen. You can take a quick google search and you can find people who've had their money seized crossing the border just for 'suspicious activity' as the cited reason. Then you have the fees for middlemen in between. Yes, you can lose everything and once the bitcoin is gone, it's literally gone. But you can mitigate many of the risks associated by educating yourself and taking proper precautions. But you shouldn't be having all your eggs in one basket anyways. I maintain most of my money in fiat currently, but use bitcoin for buying/sending to others.
     
And holy shit are you ever close minded. Every single point you made was with "I don't...", "I never...". The vast majority of the world does NOT have access to a bank.
      
tldr; Just because males don't use bra's does not mean that bra's are awful and have no real applications.

1) What kind of hole do you live in? The tech allows you to do MICRO TRANSACTIONS, sending money abroad and within moments. Have you ever had a friend in another country buying a beer? You can pay for it by just scanning his QR code from anywhere so long as you have the connection. You can tip people on reddit for 5 cents just for giving a laugh if you don't want to give them gold instantly versus them having to give out a Paypal email. Also, bitcoin is a great alternative to Paypal just because of speed, costs as well as the fact that Paypal can just terminate services with you and basically run off with your money. Just because it has no application to YOU specifically, it's not useful. Also, for Brazil, it's not as widespread as there isn't many options/exchanges that have opened, but in other places in the world, it's gaining traction (ie: Philippines). Considering that credit cards, paypal and other traditional methods do not work, sometimes Western Union is your only option. Western Union costs like $5 transfer fees to send $200 for just a local transaction. Bitcoin does ANY AMOUNT for pennies and there isn't as big a spread on currency exchange (2.5%). Take a look at how much rebit saves compared to sending via WU. The remittance market is huge and is billions in just money. Western Union made 5.5 TRILLION in revenues in 2013. Imagine if instead of charging $5 on a $200 transaction (this is a local only transaction. It costs much more if you send internationally by about 3% more) it was only 5 cents (1% of $5). So, imagine if that 99% went back to the people, much better and much more convenient.
         
2) You're asking more of the value of money and what gives money value. Would you accept gold then? In short, you don't have to. If you don't like it, then don't accept it. But keep in mind that it's not chargebackable, it means you make more. Merchants accepting credit cards and the like also face the risk of chargebacks, sometimes months after the fact. They also have to pay a 2.5% percentage of their sales revenue to the credit card company. Bitcoin companies like BitPay or Coinbase charges ~1% to instantly convert to FIAT or 0% (if you do it yourself). 
3) You should just go live in a forest and be a hermit for the rest of your life if you actually want to kill yourself. People won't magically become richer than anyone else in history of mankind, not even close. People "gambled" on it because they believe it has the potential. But it can easily go to zero. High risk, high reward. This world isn't fair, but that doesn't mean you should just off yourself to make a statement.
       
4) Well, nothing to say since you don't really know what you're trying to state. The technology is scalable and many different coins are being released. Bitcoin is as well, but slower due to the immense size and the possible effects. I suggest you watch a couple videos of Andreas Antonopolous presenting bitcoin.
      
5) That's fine. At it's current state, governments have an extreme amount of capital controls. Read up on civil asset forfeiture. Banks can shut down your accounts for any reason at all. You know that once the banks get your money, it's more of an IOU, they can choose not to give you anything when you attempt to withdraw it. **Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank and take more of a financial responsibility.** Not everyone can do it.

1. Yes, I have.
2. I liked the whole concept about buying and selling quickly under a few hours.
3. I was looking into it as an option to sell to others, but the problem I had was the fact that the volume was low.

That's a technical objection coming from you. And you don't even seem like you know what you're talking about. And two orders of magnitude is only a starting point, and the network demand isn't great enough to merit making such changes. Yet.

Escrow is a trusted third party. If your cousin is trying to buy tickets from some guy in michigan, i would assume your cousin is fairly close to the guy in michigan or within reason. Drive there, meet the guy and see the tickets are legit.
      
Treat a bitcoin transaction as a cash transaction.

Don't worry about it. What you should be concerned of is the same as meeting anybody online, where they are asking you to meet, the time, and the size of the transaction. Also, if they can speak properly and coherently is usually something you should look out for as well.

People are using mobile minutes as currency in 3rd world countries as a replacement to their falling currency.

Actually, the $25 is reasonable because it is not a SWIFT document that they probably are asking the bank to do, it is a wire trace which will outline the ins and outs and the intermediary banks. As for the 2 weeks ish, i am not sure what's the deal on that, I can understand 1 week though.
      
source: had to do wire traces before. Some provide it for free, but the bank has to contact their own internal wire department to determine the steps that happen. The SWIFT system is quite archaic.

Same here, I did mine on May 31st.

I initiated the wire on May 31st, I still haven't gotten a deposit yet. I sent in a ticket and haven't gotten a response yet either. Radio silent.

they've ignored my wire deposit for 2 weeks so far and haven't responded on support yet.

wires have a cut off time on a business day, usually around noon. you still need to wait a few days or so, depending on the senders and receivers country. i worked at a bank.
