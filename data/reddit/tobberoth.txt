Isnt it enough to search for your wallet address on a blockexplorer like blockchain.info? The first transaction to your wallet should be it.

Wow, hugged to death immediately.

Lightning network is more or less a fix for this, it will make transfers far faster and in turn cheaper. There are solutions, the question is just which solutions will win out, and when.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:09:24
Just a pure guess, but I honestly doubt it will be all that different from right now. It looks like a fairly clear downtrend at the moment, it jumps up at times but there's no momentum to carry it. Im guessing it will dip down more and then it will hopefully work its way up over time, especially as stuff like lightning becomes a bigger deal on the mainnet. So yeah, probably around 10-11k, but hopefully on an upward trend at that point.

Bitcoins blockchain is designed to grow at about one block every 10 minutes, regardless of the amount of coins in circulation and how many miners there are.

No cap, though in my country, I have to report to the tax agency if I send more than 15 000 euro in one go.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:54:26
Doing a face-to-face transaction with someone you've never met seems pretty risky. When you're talking about ~500,000 euros? Yeah, that just seems crazy.

TradingView.com is pretty cool. Here's a chart for bitfinex btc/USD:

I don't believe outgoing addresses show up there. I have sent btc from my coinbase wallet (and only have one address in that link) but nothing shows up on blockchain.info when searching for it, all my transactions from coinbase show up as different outgoing addresses.

To use meme terms, if btc shoots to the moon, while at the same time being adopted, it's fine. Everyone buys their lambos using btc and the value stays high.
No adoption though? Pump and dump, once the value is high enough whales dump btc for fiat and people lose out on the gains.

Where would you pay 30% in fees to get bitcoin? Hell, even just buying at market price on gdax has a 0.25% fee.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:22:48
Even if you split all possible bitcoins up into their smallest part (1 satoshi) and made one wallet for each satoshi (so pretty much the theoretical maximum of useful bitcoin wallets), the amount of wallets compared to the amount of possible wallets would be absolutely microscopic, the chance of an accidental collision impossibly small.
That said, it's an interesting question when you ignore accidental collision and look at attempts at collisions. With enough computing power, could you possibly generate enough wallets each second to eventually get a collision? Most likely, the question is just how much computing power would be needed, how much time would be needed, and could it possibly be profitable considering just how expensive it would be to run such a brute-force search?
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:33:41
Which means you won't sell it at all, which makes one wonder what "value" means in this case.
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:30:46
Coinbase takes a fee, like most places. Use maker limit orders on gdax if you dont want to pay fees.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:29:46
Depends on where you buy them, there's no definite price on bitcoin. The specific market, the current market value, fees and so on all affect it.
At the moment you'll probably get somewhere around 0.009830 btc, less if there's fees involved.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:40:59
Did you do a market sell? Gdax will automatically match you with buying orders, its likely to get split into several fills at different magnitudes.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:23:07
Yes. In fact, you might want to look into using gdax rather than coinbase to buy/sell your coins. Coinbase is easier to use but takes a pretty big fee, where as gdax has no fee at all as long as you make maker orders. Transfers between coinbase and gdax are free and instant.

Bears short selling bitcoin are obviously benefiting massively at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:49:42
Impossible to know. We can of course look at news like the one you posted, but what about all the people who have simply lost their private keys? All of the satoshis in their wallets are going to be lost, and it will add up.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:33:52
Gdax. Plenty of criticism of them out there (or coinbase), but it has worked perfectly for me. I've heard a lot of people complain about their wiretransfers but they have been very solid for me, even when sending relatively big amounts of cash. Maybe it's because I'm European and SEPA just works better than US wire transfers? No idea.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:55:09
Correct. Should be added that it could possibly be a group of people as well.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:18:18
The whole point is that you only need the public key to verify that a signature was made from the proper private key, while you only need the private key to actually create a signature.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:04:42
Fees are flat and dependant on how taxed the system is. If you dont pay a high enough fee, your transaction will not be included in any transaction blocks and wont be transfered, it will just be stuck in limbo.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:13:36
How long have you waited for it to go through? Bitcoin transactions usually take about an hour, the fact that it asked for identification is perfectly normal, exchanges pretty much have to do that because of various laws.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:33:08
"I need to recover some money" sounds like a fairly short-term goal, something cryptocurrency is not fit for considering how volatile it is. You just lost money and need to make it back, now is not the time to take risks.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:46:22
I don't get the whole discussion on intrinsic value, is it even relevant? Sure, buying stocks means you technically own a part of a company, but what about futures? You're buying a contract concerning future purchases of some underlying instrument... how does that have any more intrinsic value than something like bitcoin? It all comes down to trust anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:16:11
I see... In Europe, it's fairly simple using a SEPA transfer, it takes a day and the fee is like... 0.1 euro or something  (I think the fee depends on the bank, mine doesn't even take a fee if the SEPA transfer is initiated online). I didn't expect it to be much different elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:19:49
Agreed, my favorite crypto channel on youtube. The videos about the people pushing bitconnect on youtube are hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:19:39
In the US, no. The only taxable events are when you sell crypto or when you use crypto to buy services or goods. As long as you just buy btc and sit on it, it's not taxable. Keep in mind that if you buy some other currency, like an alt coin, that counts as you selling your btc, which is taxable.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:14:25
I don't think there's any plans at the moment in bitcoin core to change from proof of work as it's implemented today. Some altcoins are trying different strategies to reduce the footprint however, such as using proof of stake instead.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:56:21
Depends on who you ask and what you consider worthwhile. Some people are speculating that the value of bitcoin will go up to 100,000 dollars in just a couple of years, so that would be a gain of 900 aud for you. Not bad, but then again, who knows. If it's a bubble, you're more likely to lose some of that cash.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:42:37
Until you get some answers here, there's a pretty good article about US taxes on bitcoin here:

I doubt it, gemeni does not operate in Europe. Kraken is an alternative.

You should probably be thinking of bitcoin as a startup. Just dreams and ideas which you're hoping and maybe even expecting will become something great one day. I wouldn't call LN a dream, it's just a work in progress and it's not ready yet, the benefits it provides have pretty much already been proven.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:56:03
Basically (as in simplified greatly), every computer in the world mining bitcoin is trying to find a specific value for each block. The first one which finds the value, gets the price. So in theory, sure, you could be the one finding the value and getting the BTC. In practice? It's never going to happen because your basement with a few computers have no chance against huge mining factories which use tons of specially built computers to search for said value. They can test billions and billions of values in the time it takes you to check a few hundred thousand. In the end, you'll just be wasting electricity.
So what's stopping people from mass mining bitcoin? Competition which is unreasonably far ahead.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:22:33
It could go out of use though. It's not likely at the moment but in the future, there's no telling if another cryptocurrency takes its place. There's absolutely no guarantee that bitcoin isn't made more or less valueless in the future.
