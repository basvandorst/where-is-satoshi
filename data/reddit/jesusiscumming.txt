There's a good chance he's in a deep depressed state of mind.  Could be that he's been pumped full of some kind of feel-good medication just to get him in front of reporters/cameras/the world.  He looks a bit dazed and out of it to me.

I know you're trying to be funny here, but in all seriousness, given that he and others may be in a fragile state of mind, I think it's a good idea to NOT bring up an idea like that.

So, being cold makes someone a douche?
Some people are just wired that way.  Just like some of us are not.

All the replies here saying "yes, do this" and calling the board "idiots" are missing the point.
The average person does not realize that Mt. Gox != Bitcoin.
The synagogue board likely is worried that the average person has heard that Bitcoins are a scam or ponzi scheme or some other untrustworthy system.  If having Bitcoin on their site might make people think the synagogue is in on the scam, then people might not trust it (the synagogue) as much.
Acting superior to them is NOT going to help Bitcoin.  Instead, he should try to sit down with them and explain what Bitcoin is and why they should keep it up.

Well, there's your problem.
There's real money involved, and whenever there's money involved there will be people who will try to take it for themselves.  These people can open an exchange just as easily as the honest people can.  There's no one vetting anyone, so any joker can say "Hey, put your bitcoins here...they'll be safe."
Do not trust anyone right now.

I agree with everything you're saying.  But, what kind of recourse do you have when you can't find the person to have them prosecuted?
The internet makes it really easy for someone to close up shop and disappear, whereas the little shop down the street will have a harder time doing that (although they still can, to a degree).

He wouldn't be able to pay everyone back 100% each though, right?
Since approx. 800,000 BTC went missing, and it appears 200,000 are back, doesn't that mean everyone would just get 25% (still better than 0%) back if doled out fairly?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:51:17
OK, no worries.
Yeah, I can see now how it's ambiguous.  But I did indeed mean "others" as in the people who have lost a lot of money.

Sounds more like older and cynical.

did you somehow miss this part?

This is not correct information.
I just this week deposited cash into my brother's Chase account.  I am not on his account, and I did not need to show any ID when I made the deposit.

I agree.

Sure, but how will you know that the "companies who do what they say they will" are not simply playing the long con?  The longer they act like good players the more business they get and the more people trust them and the more BTC they will be able to steal when they decide to execute the final phase of their con.
You can never be sure.

Yeah, I think in the "old days" you were likely to get hacked by someone with physical access to your computer.
But things have changed and at least now if someone jacks my password that's written on a piece of paper I at least have a chance of narrowing down who the culprit is.  Online I have no hope of catching the culprit.

Ah, wait a second, when you wrote "In this life..." did you mean this world that we all live in, or in the world of "international equity management firm[s]?"
I thought you meant the former, and I just don't believe that just because you're making 10s of millions of dollars per year necessarily means you're a bad person.
If you mean the latter, then it's a world I'm not familiar with, and I'll sort of take your word for it that everyone at the top there had/has to compromise morals and ethics to maintain their position...meaning there's a higher likelihood that they are not good people.

wasn't mt.gox an exchange, not a bank?
