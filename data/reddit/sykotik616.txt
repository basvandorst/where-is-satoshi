I really dislike people like you with your crap attitude.  You obviously have zero formal education in finance or business, and you obviously have no idea how Bitcoin price works.  Just because there is good news doesnt mean anything.  The price is based on supply and demand.  Currently bitcoins supply is constantly increasing, approximately 3000 new coins per day, which means that for the bitcoin price to remain the same demand has to meet or exceed that supply.  Which isnt going to happen.  This can be attributed to lack of adoption.  Businesses simply arent accepting bitcoin, and there arent enough businesses pushing for adoption.  To make things worse, the businesses that accept bitcoin dont hold them.  It makes no sense for them to hold them, because they cant use bitcoin to buy their supplies.  So not only does bitcoin need to reach more of the general public, it needs to reach more final product businesses, and it needs to reach the business suppliers.  But for it to be appealing to business it needs to stabalize, and become more popular.  Hence the reason that anytime you go anywhere you should be asking if they accept bitcoin.  It helps spread the word, puts it in their head.
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:16:42
What you all seem to fail to understand is this.....  Any publicity is good for Bitcoin.  Regardless of the reason, this person is trying to push Bitcoin, and advertise its use.  Which is more than 99 percent of you have done for the community.
@_date: 2014-12-20 15:51:02
NEVER BUY IN PEAKS!!!  Price will drop shortly anyway.  Just because people are driving up short term price doesn't mean it will continue to go up.  Betting against bitcoin is has proven to be the best strategy.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:58:37
The answer to that is easy.  There is a serious lack of businesses pushing for Bitcoin use.  Nobody is out educating consumers about Bitcoin.  Nobody is activley spreading Bitcoin adoption to supply chains.  Nobody cares.  All anyone is concerned about is the price.  Ultimately its all about convenience, and even today its hard to access to instant bitcoin, much less try and find a place to spend it.  People want ease of use.  Businesses like npbitcoin.com have the right idea.  Spreading adoption, and educating the general public for free.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:16:48
Thats why we as a bitcoin community need to support companies, and small businesses that are pushing for merchant adoption.  Companies that offer bitcoin integration services.  So that when people want to spend coin they wont need a card.  Im not asking for support for my business as we are only currently working locally.  But it gives some point of reference.

You are actually 100 percent wrong.  I suggest you actually read the guidance, to include the new releases.  Its states very clearly that processing or facilitating the trade or sale of bitcoin classifies you as an msb.

@_date: 2014-11-16 02:32:14
I think you are totally wrong.  Its still in the early growth stages of its product life cycle.  Bitcoin makes credit/debit companies almost obsolete.  As a business owner, and a finance major, i can say for a fact that a businesses ultimate goal is to generate revenue, period, and if that business can use a free service to potentially save 3 plus percent on their bottom line they will take advantage of that opportunity.  We just arent there yet.  Its going to be slow growth until we get people out there really pushing for adoption.  
@_date: 2014-10-20 00:08:28

Bitcoin cannot be centeralized.  It may seem that way.  But no one source will ever control the flow or production of all the bitcoin.  Im not sure where you are getting your centeraliztion definition.  But its wrong in the context held throughiut this post.  The fed on the other hand, who runs our monetary policy, does directly control the creation, and distribution of monies, not to mention our interest rates, and the rates at which big banks can borrow money.  Does that sound like bitcoin to you?  Or anyone here?  We are not moving towards as centeralized bitcoin.  Your just an uneducated idiot.

Perhaps you should have read their terms of service, and if you say you did, and they were different rules then, prove it.
@_date: 2014-10-26 13:46:21
Yes its going to 200 easily.  Its not that there isnt demand for bitcoin.  Its trying to cover the 3000 worth of new supply every day.  There simply is not enough demand to keep up with the growing supply.  Basic economics says that if there is more supply than demand, price will drop.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:00:13
It does not apply be personal transactions.  Only to businesses that act directly as an "administrator", or "exchanger", a "user" is not an msb under fincen guidlines.  LocalBitcoins is in for some huge changes though.  The 2014 guidance only clarifies more who msb's are.  If you purchase bitcoins from one party and sell them to another party, or facilitate the transmission, you are an msb.  And you should be.  After posting ads online for my own business, within 1 day i had money launderers trying to use my service.  Which had to be reported.  They stole some ladies id and were trying to get me to sell over 5k in bitcoin.  I wonder how many other people on local bitcoins are knowingly laundering money.

Lol all of you that say bitcoin is dead are stupid.  Plain and simple.  Why is the bitcoin price down?  Simple supply and demand.  It amazes me how little each and everyone of you know about simple economics.  
About 3000 bitcoins are generated everyday, which means that supply remain increases daily, while demand remains the same or goes down.  This means a lower price.
Bitcoin is far too overpriced and has been since the bubble, and if any of you are the least bit intelligent, you would have realized it.  I love watching all these amatuer investors freak out.  A more realistic bitcoin price is in the 200s, maybe even the hundreds.  
Furthermore bitcoin has not lost its use.  You can still use it for the same purpose.  Its still bitcoin.  Its just being valued at a reasonable level.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:36:18
What needs to be considered is bitcoin has been extremly over priced for far to long.  There has been a lack of adoption, due to the fact that there are few businesses activley marketing bitcoin.  Bitcoin isnt dying, its finalky getting to the point its supposed to be at.  Bitcoin use and awareness campaign.  Indiegogo, and gofundme.  Take a look.

@_date: 2014-10-16 18:34:16
Its not a damn chicken and egg problem.  We dont need plastic, its a step backwards.  The Bitcoin payment system was meant and built around mobile devices.  More business do need to start accepting.  Thats why people need to support small businesses like npbitcoin.com
Try telling some that knows nothing about bitcoin, that they have to create an account to get a wallet.  Then you have to sign up to an exchange to get bitcoin.  But instead of using the app and its built in payment function, you need to sign up with another party who will send you a debit card, in a week, but you have to transfer your bitcoins to that card first.  
How convenient does that sound?  Nobody would want to do that.  People need to be educated on the benefits of bitcoin, businesses need to accept bitcoin otherwise the peopee wont want it, and finally businesses need to be able to purchade their supplies in bitcoin, otherwise the businesses just going to cash out.  Those are the 3 main problems with the use market today
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:26:18
Listen.....  mining is all about staying ahead of the curve.  If you didnt start at least a year and a half ago, you missed your chance.  When mining started becoming mainstream a bunch of people bought equipment.  Other people made a business out of it.  Now only those busnirsses can afford to keep up with mining.  Not to mention any serious mining company has free or very low cost energy.  So i kinda agree with you.  But difficulty and block rewards are adjustable.
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:56:07
Actually, you are pnly part right.  Bitcoin is a store of value.  A way to trasmit and account value from one place to another wothout there having to be a middle man, or centeral authority to control it.  That is where bitcoin gets its value.  Other than that its simple supply and demand.

Its not fair to businesses that dont want to keep bitcoin.  Unfortunately nobody is doing much to promote business to business use.  Which is why merchants sell all their coin.  If they could buy the necessary product from businesses that accepted bitcoin they would.  Hence the reason i started a company that does just that.

Bitcoins intrinsic value lies in what it offers.  Above anything else Bitcoin is a service.  It is a free service that offers the ability to send money to anyone, anywhere, for virtually zero cost.  Western Union and other money transmitter businesses charge a large percent, I believe that its in the area of 20% per transaction.  Furthermore, this also gives merchants the ability to deny credit cards in favor of Bitcoin.  Have you ever been to a business that has a minimum of $5 to use your credit/debit card.  Thats because the charge rate is fixed below a certain price, and the card tech companies like verifone get a huge cut of the sale, and it is not profitable for the business anymore.  Bitcoin also reduces the 2+% per transaction of other services like square and paypal.  However, both systems have announced Bitcoin integration.
Thats how Bitcoin gets its value.  Demand for Bitcoin outweighs the current supply being offered, price goes up.  If there is more Bitcoin than people are willing to buy, price goes down.  Im surprised that so many people invest in this and have zero knowledge about basic economic principles.  Not taking a stab at you or anything, it is a very good, and valid question.... It just surprises me is all....

This is a pile of hot bs.  Buyers and miners are not msb's.  Fincen specifically states that people using bitcoin as an investment tool are not msb's.  Furthermore, fincen states that "users" are also not msb's.  This has zero effect on merchants who accept bitcoin, or people that use bitcoin.
If you buy bitcoin from one party and then sell it to another party, and that is the main scope of your business, you are an msb.  If you facilitate the transmission of bitcoin, or currency, from one party to another, you are an msb.  Other than that, this new gudiance is nothing businesses shouldnt already be following from the 2013 guidance.
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:15:58
While I agree with you, the fact of the matter is that what you suggested is not going to happen.  At least we are trying to do something about it.

@_date: 2014-10-16 14:24:02
Lol i love reading through these.  Its simple.  The price dropped to a point where everyone thought it was a good investment, the 300 mark area.  Demand soared and drove the price back up past 400.  But it startes to slow down again so people started to sell their coin.  Demand drops, supply is up, price goes down.....  people are going to continue to sell to try and hedge their risk, or atleast get what they can out of it.  I bought in at 300 sold at 400, and now im waiting to catch that wave again.  If you wanna make a profit now, get an sccount where you can short sell, sell of a bunch of coin and pick it up at a lower price.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:48:59
As much as i would like to believe that chart analysis in bitcoin means nothing.  Recent technical analysis clued me in on the peak we just had.  There is a very clear flag pattern that led to a breakout, which ultimatley led to me gaining 100 per bitcoin.  Maybe some of you should take technical analysis more seriously, maybe mix it in with some market psychology.
Edit:  Bitcoin is still very bearish.  Shorting bitcoin is a much better bet.

@_date: 2014-10-26 13:41:34
Wtf dont you people understand.  CurrenC and Applepay are a joke.  As i have said before, google wallet has already been doing this for years.  The problem with the applepay and currentC systems is the charges.  You have to buy an extra special reader, and continue to pay fees on every transaction.  Oh what!!!  You said bitcoin can be operated on a phone, tablet, or computer, and they dont charge high fees, or require special equipment for acceptance.  See the difference?
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:36:55
Well im sorry to hear about your losses.  That is exactly the kind of thing we are trying to prevent.  As an investor I can say that the decision to put all of ones disposable income in to such a volatile entity like Bitcoin is not the best decision.  You had nothing to hedge your risk.  Bitcoin has shown a significant down trend since the burst happened, betting that Bitcoin price rising is a hard bet.
But Bitcoin isnt a pyramid scheme.  There is no sole owner or person profiting off getting other people to join.  There arent sales levels.  The price is based on all sorts of things, just like any other type of commodity or security.

Take a finance class bro.  If you have no idea what short selling is, then you should not be participating in it.  To keep it simple, selling short is basically betting against the price.  Lets say i think the price is going to drop.  I can short bitcoin, which is loaned to me, when the price drops i repurchase said bitcoin, and repay the loaner, while keeping the excess profit.
Edit...  Reagrdless of which direction the price moves the bitcoin has to be paid back.  So if the price goes up, your losing money.

No, what op was saying is that when businesses accept bitcoin, they cant buy what they need from their suppliers in bitcoin to continue day to day busniess.  This leads to businesses having to convert their coin into fiat to pay their manufacturing, supply, distribution, and retail costs.

No need to be a D bag.  No one forced you to read this.  Furthermore, the majority of people worldwide have not taken econ101, so this may be helpful for them.  Reagrdless of what you think, op does have a point.  If users buy bitcoin only for them to be ultimately sold for fiat casues price decline.  Lack of adoption is what is causing price decline today.  Too much supply not enough demand, and with 86,000 plus accepting merchants around constantly selling their coin has a serious impact on the current bitcoin economy.  So take the stick out your ass.

If it's a big company you better be prepared to to explain to them acceptable accounting procedures that are in compliance with GAAP,  and explain how taxes work regarding the length held and general use.

I love to come here and watch people bash on TA.  Bottom line, after 4 years of continued education and getting a BBA with a major in Finance, I use TA among other methods for stock prediction.  And of the last 150 trades I have done in the past 6 months I have been wrong about %3.  So say what you want, because I'm Killin it.

You keep thinking that, and I'll keep making my profits of Bitcoin trades.  The Bitcoin market has become quite a predictable entity, especially to those that have been around for a while and have a decent education.

How fast does it get there via bank account or debit card?

Don't "invest" in bitcoin unless you are prepared to deal with loses, or are an experienced day trader.

When are you going to learn that news has nothing to do with the price.  You want a good indicator of where the price is going?  Learn to read charts, volume traded, price trends, market psycology.  Just because there is good news doesnt mean anything.  It's all supply and demand.

I respectfully disagree with you.  People don't use Bitcoin because:
1.  They have never heard of it.
2.  They don't understand how to use it.
3.  They don't know why to use it.
4.  There are almost no places locally that accept it.  I'm in michigan, and I run a Bitcoin consulting firm, there are only 80 businesses here that accept Bitcoin, the majority in Detroit.  But I can say this, our Skyhook Atm gets more business every week.  Somebody new is always coming in and getting Bitcoin.
The problem with credit cards now is fraud, and identity theft.  It's not just money people lose.  It's everything that's connected to the credit card, name, address, phone number, email, pin numbers, social security number, etc...

What if they dont?  What if their partnership with the Federal Reserve happenes.  People won't have a choice like they do now to switch to Bitcoin.  It will simply be how things are run; the Federal Reserve overseeing every single transaction made by everyone in the U.S.  
Honestly I don't think you are taking this threat serious enough.  Why would you switch to Bitcoin if your government and bank is automatically going to do it for you on their system?  
Furthermore, my concern isn't that they are stealing Bitcoins idea.  It's that this means the government is trying to fight the progression of Bitcoin by partnering with IBM to create a system like Bitcoin that will be implemented whether you like it or not.

It will never happen.  %100 anonymity is not possible.  There will always be someone, or something somewhere that can track you.  Furthermore, for Bitcoin adoption to increase you need to appeal to regular people, who ultimatley think that complete anonymity is a bad thing.  If it can be associated with drugs and is is nobody wants to support that.

Stay away from localbitcoins.  Find a local ATM, buy from Circle.com if you get a chance.  Its free to purchase from them if you link a bank account, and they offer instant bitcoin without a credit card.

Some emails you just have to open.  I'm sure that your BlockChain account wasn't the issue.  I'm 90 percent sure that you did something to allow access to your email.

Easy, more people are demanding Bitcoin.  Not to mention the BIT (Bitcoin Investment Trust) is getting ready to go public.  They are predicting at least 60 million into that trust.

This rise is significantly different than the rest.  If you lay out the charts month by month and lay down liniar regression lines you see a very obvious downward sloping trend in every month, except the month where price hit 600.  Over the past month we have seen slow growth in an upward trend.  There is no month in the history of Bitcoin that looks like this.

Unfortunately I have to disagree.  For one simple reason.....  Christians.  Unfortunately Christianity is the dominant religion in the world and they believe that the one world currency is a sign of the apocolypse.  That's why politicians target the religous.  They are the majority.

You only have to pay taxes on bitcoin in america if you use it as an investment.  If you use it as a currency no taxes need to be paid.  Read the information on fincen.gov.  Search for Bitcoin on their website.  
But if it's an investment, you have to pay capital gains taxes (held for long term, or 1 year or more), or regular taxes if less than a year, which you would need to know the profit or loss on every transaction you make.  And if you are a smart investor you are doing this anyways.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:20:22
Thanks for the verify.
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:36:14
Not true.  If you people are going to be Bitcoin users, enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, investors, or whatever you want to be with Bitcoin, it would behoove you to read and understand America's financial rules.
Go to 
Google "Fincen Bitcoin"
Read rules and regulations regarding MSBs
Read rules and regulations regarding Money Transmission businesses.
I have read them personally only because my Bitcoin business is trying to be "legitimate".  I can tell you for a fact that the above is not true.  You might be surprised to find out how low it actually is.  Also, Fincen clearly defines what suspicious activity is regarding monies.  
@_date: 2015-03-31 12:10:33
I agree that it's important.  As a Bitcoin business owner we deal with a lot of people trying to launder money.  Our AML policy significantly reduces attempts at money laundering.  Not only did I save my business from losing money from an inevitable chargeback, I prevented someone's identity from being used to purchase Bitcoin illegally.
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:58:15
Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:18:26
This isn't necessarily true.  If you read the rules on fincen bitcoin is taxed in two differet ways depending on the primary use of the bitcoin.

Why don't you, obviously the smarter one, set them up with a wix page or WordPress where they can sell their art for Bitcoin.  It would literally take less than a hour of your time.

I also move my coin immediately, but when I tried to send after purchase it froze, and now i cant get in.......
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:40:25
True.  PayPal doesn't guarantee digital sales for the business.  If you complete a charge back you get your bitcoin and money and the business loses money.
@_date: 2015-03-11 11:48:46
I was just going to say this.

We have other accounts.... the problem is that we bought coin, went to send it, circle froze, now we cant get back in to send it somewhere....

I would gladly debate the finer points of Bitcoin with anyone.  But when I use factual evidence to support my case I expect the other person to concede, which I don't think anyone from would do.  My business is Bitcoin, we buy, sell, trade, setup merchants, and educate the public.  So i am pretty well informed on the subject.  Not to mention hold a BBA and working towards my MBA.  So if we do debate don't come up in here with unscholary sources for references.

Lol no I'm afraid of the government which is already chipping away at our rights furthering their agenda to monitor and control everything about the country.  If the FED has their way, this means that they will oversee every transaction made, a record of everything you do with your money that is linked directly to you.  I don't want the government to know exactly what I'm doing with my money.  I don't want the government to monitor my bank account all the time.  Because you know they will develop a program to flag suspicious transactions.  Next thing you know, you have police, or special financial division teams showing up questioning you about why you did this with your money.  You think Coinbase is bad?  Wait till the government is the regulating industry.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:38:16
No.  "You people", is referring specifically to those that are trying to work within the Bitcoin realm/community, but do not do their research, or are too gullible, and believe things like this without verifying information from a legitimate source.

I suggest you invest in a Bitcoin company.  Npbitcoin.com is looking for investors for equity capital.  Business plan ready.  I will turn that 50,000 into a million dollars in revenue a year in 4 years.  Investing in a company is going to yield you more than what Bitcoin will, and you will be part owner of a company.

I'm so glad to see that intelligent life exists somewhere on reddit.  Confirmation bias happens a lot with bitcoin, and basically any information that conflicts with prior beliefs.  Great job riplin.

What's your point?  The people that hacked Target, Home Depot, and Chick-fil-A made off with millions too, not to mention private information like names, addresses, SSNs, and emails associated with the accounts.  What about Goldman Sachs admitting that they cover for and help their high profile clients, and that the government let's it happen?  What about the bank system that allowed for home owners to over extend knowing that people couldn't afford it, causing another great depression?  You seem to talk a lot about bad news with Bitcoin.  But for every negative thing you bring up about Bitcoin, I can easily bring up two more bad stories about the US dollar.
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:36:03
It's not that circle wants to do this.  Rules and regulations for US based Crypto currency exchanges require the verification of ID past a certain level.  Read the rules on Fincen.gov that regulate what MSBs (Money Service Businesses) have to follow.  They also keep records of all your transactions for a 5 year period and report suspicious activity to the governement.  It's required to operate.  So your logic is wrong.  If Circle wants to continue to grow and now get shut down, they have to get your ID.  So suck it up and support Bitcoin businesses.
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:15:48
I've got something here.....  Have you heard about how the US Dollar is the most widley used currency in the world to fund illegal opperations?  Do we still use it?  Yep!  Case and point.
