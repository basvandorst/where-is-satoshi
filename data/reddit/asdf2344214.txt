Cash advance from an ATM, and then cash deposit into some localbitcoins.com seller's bank account or libertyx.com convenience store. This is likely to be more efficient than amazon/purse.io.

I doubt that.. bitsquare might be less full of scammers than other market places.. possibly because it's not worth their time, but the payment methods they use are all reversible. 
Maybe it's getting better from a volume perspective but even 300 BTC per month is like 10 BTC per day.. it's still not a liquid market.

There really aren't many exchanges with access to US banking.. probably the only other major options would be  and  but I don't think either allow 'instantaneous' purchases.. you need to wait for the deposit to clear.. and itbit doesn't even really have US banking as there's no way to deposit via ach. There are some other credit card options, but they aren't really worth considering due to fees. There is also  which allows cash purchases and those are instant.

imo it died when the tipbot went off chain.. not that offchain is necessarily bad, but if you have to register an account with your email and other details? on some website then I'm out.. I've even received tips that I never collected 'cause I'd rather not receive $2 than give my email addr to changetip. Perhaps if lightning network tipping becomes a thing it will see a revival.

only by reputation.. like localbitcoins.. the main problem with bitsquare it is that noone uses it at all.. if you're a market taker there are no remotely attractive offers and if you're a maker there's no buyers either so maybe you make an offer that's 10% over market and someone eventually buys $10 worth of BTC and you make $1.. there's no incentive on either side and it's just a circular problem.. no market so no participants so no market..

The best way would be to somehow get cash from the visa gift card.. I'd suggest withdrawing the balance from an ATM except that I guess $56 is probably not possible to withdraw.. so maybe withdraw $50 and try to spend the $6 on coffee or whatever else you might otherwise have bought anyway and add the money 'saved' by using the visa card to your cash pot.. then take the cash to a bank and deposit it in a localbitcoins seller's bank account.
