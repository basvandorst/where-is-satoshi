Commerce in Taiwan is fairly old school, especially agriculture; most businesses prefer cash and working with people they already know through familiar channels. It's not impossible... but you asked for reasons why it won't work ;)

Haters gonna hate... at least the r/buttcoin crowd tends to do so with a sharp wit and a certain panache. You might not find their commentary funny but many people do, even those with bitcoin sympathies (like myself).
Consider another angle: if the community can't stand up to this sort of skewering then it has no future whatsoever. The sort of stuff r/buttcoin harps on (e.g. gambling addiction, cognitive dissonance about bitcoin security, recruiting senior citizens and children, vacuous anti-government/fiat money rhetoric, the cult-like mentality surrounding the technology) tend to be deserving of such negative attention.

You're right about Taiwan not being a cash-based society... but I wonder if Bitcoin might open up the world of online shopping to people still used to cash-on-delivery as a payment method? The real question is whether or not Taiwanese people can use Bitcoin to purchase goods they would otherwise have some difficulty in procuring (e.g. by not having a credit card).
Incidentally, this article features one of my photos... cool :)

I run a web site about as popular as yours (and for similar reasons too). A while back [I started accepting bitcoin donations]( after several visitors introduced me to the technology.
At first donations via bitcoin were a fairly regular event... but ever since the price surged toward an all-time-high bitcoin donations have dried up. I don't mean that people donate smaller amounts of bitcoin; I mean that in general people aren't donating bitcoin at all anymore. Nothing on my end has changed; I'm still devoting an incredible amount of time to stocking my site with free content. Actually, I made things a little easier by putting an address in the footer of the site and making a post about it. 
My guess is that people began to realize how much more valuable bitcoin might be in the future... and became a little more miserly as a result. You may get a little boost from a popular post like this in r/bitcoin but are bitcoin donations viable in the long run? I'm not so sure even though I am also 100% in support of bitcoin.

Boom is pretty much the most progressive electronic music festival on any front you can imagine... so I'm not at all surprised that they're accepting Bitcoin too!

There were more scams and hacks 3 or 4 years ago? How do you figure? It seems to me like scams are much more common (and insidious) than they ever were. While the bitcoin ecosystem has been developing so have the scammers... and the big swings in bitcoins value were likely enough to get some real pros into the game.
Otherwise I don't disagree... the community needs to self-regulate otherwise bitcoin is doomed.

Exactly. From a UX perspective, offering a dazzling array of options to tip or donate is bad form. Better to have a means of letting people add to a sort of in-game currency that can then be distributed at will, somewhat like Flattr.
Speaking of which, I had to check if Flattr takes Bitcoin and they don't appear to. What gives?

BitTorrent is good for geeks and a barrier to entry for everyone else... hence designing the platform around direct downloads. Look around and compare download counts; you'll see that going direct increases the audience by a considerable amount.
You are of course welcome to upload and seed the releases on your tracker of choice, just be sure to provide a link back and keep the metadata looking sharp. It also helps if you wait a few days in case source files change (they sometimes do) but let's be realistic here, everyone wants to up their ratio :)

I sometimes feel like an outlier in that I find Bitcoin interesting but I don't have any deep seated hatred of banks. Most of the ones I deal with are just fine and I don't mind paying modest fees for some of the services they provide. They've certainly been less hassle than Bitcoin most of the time.

Ah, the Brave New World of Bitcoin. Interesting thought experiment but you'd need to write a novel, not this short story, to make a truly convincing case. My main issue with your logic here is simply that it doesn't account for incremental or gradual change. Sure, if Bitcoin soaked up the entire world's wealth overnight we'd see something like the dystopian future you envision. More likely, in my humble opinion, is a process of adaptation to the new norm.

Have they learned anything from the dot com boom and bust? The fact is that VCs are both the architects and victims of hype. Sometimes their bets pay off, sometimes not. At the very least the current BTC bullishness will drive additional services, more infrastructure, and perhaps a few revolutionary ideas, so I certainly don't think it is a bad thing... but I have had to stop myself before saying "VCs are down with Bitcoin" in arguments with skeptic friends. It's not actually such a good argument for the future of Bitcoin :)

I've been operating a niche market free music portal for many years now. At the encouragement of long-time fans and members of r/bitcoin I added a Bitcoin address for donations a little while ago... which has actually been hugely helpful as community support via Bitcoin has covered most of my hosting expenses for the last few months. If you're up for adding something a little out in left field, though not without significant download counts (more than 10,000,000 releases served), here's the address:

I went to Scotia Bank and made a deposit into Cavirtex last week. I had cash to play the market a day later. Easier than I thought... but the people at the bank weren't really sure how to handle the deposit. Just show them the info provided on the site and ask for a manager if you have any trouble.
