Thanks for the citation, however, it is evident that the journalist who wrote that piece is not an expert on technology, nor does it address the side of the issue that I would like to see a citation for (namely, the energy consumption of the traditional banking system globably).
First, the author refers to mining as a 'complex process' where computers solve 'mathematical equations' in exchange for 'a bitcoin'. 
Second, it is 100% possible to give a true lower bound for bitcoin's energy consumption, computable by taking the network difficuly and the hashrate to watt efficiency of the most efficient ASIC on the market. No unreasonable assumptions required.
Lastly, all this analysis ignores the fact that altcoins exist, and are being mined and are processing transactions too. It would be really interesting to see how much energy the whole crypto space is consuming, and how many transactions are being processed by all coins combined. Don't forget a lot of people use GPUs to mine altcoins just so that they can trade those altcoins for BTC, thus "mining" the bitcoin indirectly.

For solar panels, you can simply open the circuit and let the voltage sit there unused. No need to do that tilting shit you said.

"Its the single most used proxy for identity when they investigate."
Yes, because most people use the internet without regards to their privacy. Even cookies are a better ID than an IP address.
Most people will connect to the internet over a dynamic ipv4, and the ISP might have no idea who the person connecting is, due to sharing of access points, and widespread piracy of wifi. I guess in reality most people nowadays use the internet over a smarthpone data plan which is very hard to disconnect from a personal identity.
"People who mine from a home IP, or an IP attached to their name get caught. People who mine over a VPN get caught. People who leave long lasting TOR connections with predictable patterns take longer. Mining is just too much network activity, and too hard for most people to secure; even experts. Its a very poor choice for sourcing anonymous BTC."
First of all, you need a source when cliaming shit like this. Only the pool operator and the immediate peers of a node will see the IP address of the miner, and that is only if the miner broadcasts the block over the same IP address as his bitcoin node. Solo mining requires the exact same network activity as running a node. Pool mining requires requesting work, but you can always broadcast your PoW over a different connection. It is trivial really. Have you ever mined?
You're only correct about this:
"A one-time trade for cash is far more likely to be anonymous."
But good luck finding a seller that takes cash. Cash deposits to a bank account are possible too, and the buyer can be anonymous, but then there's a digital connection to the seller's sid eof the transaction,and you have to cover all your bases when it comes to the phyisical operational security with regards to cameras around the point of deposit.

@_date: 2018-06-25 02:55:13
Yeah, but there's more people willing to sell at today's price than people willing to buy at that price, that's why the sellers have to submit sell orders at cheaper prices to match with the buyers further down the chart, and that's why the price goes down.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:31:24
It does give you a special form of anonimity, namely never having had to exchange another form of money for BTC. No on-ramp. No exchange. If you really think the IP address on the packet that announces the block to the network is a unique personal identifier, there you are not very tech savvy. I guess even mining on a pool can still provide you a very good degree of anonimity in this sense.

No, because the profits they took were extracted from the previously existing pool of money elsewhere in the economy. This does not balance the debt that was created. There is always more debt than money, and as the money base grows, so does the debt base. This is the carrot and stick that pushes the economy to grow at compounded rates.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:31:36
Nope. With the ability to break SHA256 you can not only break PoW, you can break addresses. You can use public keys derived from private keys as the initialization vector for your SHA256 attack, and pretend to own any particular bitcoin address, so you can spend anybody's bitcoin and no one will be able to prove that the attacker was not the real owner of the address (unless maybe if he had reused the address, exposing a different public key than the one used to spend the address the second time around).
To summarize, breaking SHA 256 allows you to: 1. Double spend 2. Mine as many blocks as you want and keep the rewards 3. Spend anybody's bitcoins irreversibly, even in the event of a PoW change.

That's just a waste of time. Each asset you acquire requires extensive due diligence in order to secure a good investment with good downside/upside risk profile. Because the markets are relatively efficient, such investments are not easy to find. If you're not rich, then you're probably going to get a better return working a full time job or starting a business than spending all your time deciding how to correctly allocate your capital. IMO the best options for someone who doesn't have over 1 million net worth are 1. hold a large % in cash, and wait for a great investment opportunity 2. Buy index funds 3. Have a well researched but highly concentrated portfolio. 4. If you can afford it, hire a value oriented money manager.

Its not just a social convention. It is an emergent property of markets. Money emerges naturally from any market as the commodity which has the most favorable qualities to make it a medium of exchange: easily transportable, easilty recognizable, easily divisible, easily transferrable, sustains its purchasing power, and it is scarce. First it was seashells, then it was gold nuggets, then gold coins, the gold deposit notes, then paper money, then plastic money, now it is a secure decentralized ledger using peer to peer crypto.

If SHA256 gets broken before the PoW has a chance to change, all bets are off, because whoever has the magic sauce can pretend to be the owner of all bitcoins at that very moment, and there will be no way for the network to decide who was the original owner after the fact. Even if you switch PoW, the attacker still holds the  power to transfer the coin stored in a SHA256 address to a new non SHA256 address.

Blockchains can be used to secure and make elections transparent. Important elections such as voting for representatives or binding referendums should always be done in person, because there is no digital mechanism which can replace securely the identity of a person. However, the blockchain can still be used in paralel to prevent malicious actors from tapering with ballots. The most useful thing blockchains bring to the table however is the ability to have veto power. Imagine if you could veto unreasonable legislation from the comfort of your home, or cancelling your support for your representative in congress because he is betraying your interests whenever you wish. Imagine being able to veto presidential decrees by having the majority of the population cast a veto to the blockchain. That would be the ultimate layer of checks and balances in a democracy.

You can replace proof of work with proof of space. You get rewarded proportionally to how much storage capacity you have. You have to plot your hard drives using a sequence of hashes which are hard to compute in real time, and you just have to do a lookup of a tiny fraction of your plotted space to try to mine each block.

Proof of stake does not level the playing field. It unlevels it. The great thing about PoW is that anyone can participate in the minting (in principle) by commiting resources external to the system.

I fail to see how that makes it a zero sum game. Money is printed, and debt greater than the quantity printed is created on bank's ledgers. They loan the printed money to the debtors, which now have the obligation to extract profit from somewhere else in the economy, either by consuming natural resources or by taking that money from consumers. The debt can only be patched up by creating a never greater sum of money, which carries an even greater amount of debt. This is why if an economy does not grow 2% or so every year, the whole world goes to shit.

The way I figured out that it can be done, is that there needs to be a central registrar system, which signs the public keys of voters, thus allowing them to participate in the blockchain. This central registrar system has to be bureaucratic, and handled by real humans, because as you say there is no other way to ensure the identity of the participants. However, it could require a multisig scheme, so that no one institution has the power to register voters unilaterally (to prevent ghost identities leaking into the blockchain to manipulate election results). The blockchain protocol itself, however can be decentralized, open source, and secure. Not just a database. For important election events, such as voting for your president, congressman, senator, or a binding referendum for a constituional ammendment or secession event, voters must be phyisically present to cast their vote on a paper ballot, but they can also cast their vote in paerelel on the blockchain to leave a transparent auditable trail, which would make the ballots tamper evident. The blockchain could still be used remotely by voters to cast vetoes on proposed legislation, and to overrule presidential orders and vetoes, as well as to submit proposals which can be voted on by the general public.

The way I see it, even with fully working LN, there's no reaosn not to scale the blocksize up as much as reasonably possible without marginalizing a large % of the userbase. More research should be focused on thin clients and secure private information retrieval of blockchain state over something like IPFS. If there was a consented blocksize schedule that would be reasonably expected to scale on par with technological deployment, that would be a great solution. Imagine a fork declaring that the new blocksize will be 16MB, and 16MB increases will come ever 2 years. The sheer economic force of bitcoin could help drive the deployment of high speed internet worldwide. Storage isn't even an issue.

Not really. It could allow 8x more transactions at much lower fee rates with current marketcap, or  8x more transactions with same fees as today, with 8x market cap. Scaling from hundred billion dollar network to trillion dollar network is significant in my opinion. Another 8x increase and we can approach affordable transactions at a semi global scale of adoption. Sure, big blocks are never going to be enough for the potential micro-transaction use cases, but off chain scaling is never going to be good enough to replace on chain transactions for larger sums, so scaling both ways is better than scaling in only one direction.

Actually having a bigger capitalization is a restriction in the stock market, because you cannot allocate a large position in a small cap stock without altering the price, so your choice of places to find value are more limited than for a smaller fund.

You can potentially arrange a contract for rent of shelter for a certain period of time in exchange for bitcoins, or for US dollars too. Many financially wise people prefer to hold cash and rent, because they perceive their cash flow from other assets like employment to be safer than real estate. Real estate can lose value too, and shelter is not the only necessity that people need to cover in order to have socioeconomic security. Bitcoin, just like any other asset class, is a potential store of value. Whether we perceive it to be risky or safe, undervalued or overvalued is a very interesting discussion, and I very much agree with your assessment that too many people are way too delusional with bitcoin greed. "Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful." This statement is true in every market, but in the case of bitcoin, the bigger losers could still be far ahead in the future when bitcoin hits against a wall and can no longer keep going up. But that could very well be at a price point of over a million dollars per coin, we simply don't know!
Right now I would consider myself crazy to buy any bitcoin. If the price quadruples again, so be it. Eventually we will hit another bear market, and even if that bear market hits the floor at a price which is higher than today, I would consider it a better time to buy than right now at the new all time high.

SHA256 asics are already 16nm, this  means they cannot make a huge jump in performace going forward, and are limited by moore's law. This means there is more opportunity now than before for more manufacturers to compete in producing asic chips. If you switch the proof of work, only non miners will go over to the fork, and miners will continue with the original chain. What % of all bitcoins do you think current miners hold today? 20%? 30%? That's still a big split. The new chain will be susceptible to 51% attacks, and to new ASIC cartels taking over the new algorithm all over again. Why don't you just make a PoS fork of bitcoin then? 
Blockchains only need enough decentralization in hashrate to the point where no entity has absolute majority. Having more decentralized hashrate means more people can participate in transforming their energy resources directly into money, but that doesn't mean the blockchain becomes more secure for users in terms of transaction censorship. As long as there is no entity with more than 50%, both cases are equal. There are already many GPU mineable coins out there. They already provide that value to people who want to use their GPUs to mint crypto.
On the other hand, having a larger blocksize means there will be more subsidy for miners once the block reward becomes too small, which means the network will support a larger hashrate difficulty, and cheaper transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:25:06

So what if I put every single dollar I have into bitcoin today, and the price crashes down 85% like it did in 2014 and takes 2 years to recover? Now every time I want to purchase a good or service I have to pay a transaction fee, my liquidity goes to shit because today very few people accept bitcoin in exchange for food or public transportation fares or rent. I would end up having to spend upwards of 85% of my net worth in that period of time, so by the time the price recovered I would still have lost money. It would take a further increase of 5x for me to be back where I started, and I would have wasted maybe 4 years of my life in the meantime. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, and that simple true fact implies that volatility does carry risk. But of course you are a financial and economic genius and you have every possible future scenario figured out at such a young age.

The value of a business with a predictable cash flow does not diminish because its publicly traded stock goes out of favor, nor does it rise when the stock is overbought. The converse tends to happen though: if the value goes up, the stock becomes more favored, if the value goes down, the stock becomes cheaper. Price is very distinct from value. How do you value Bitcoin and how do you decide if buying at the current price is a good or bad decision?

That just means nodes could be unknowingly propagating invalid transactions over the peer to peer network, flooding it and causing DDoS. Nodes need to be able to defensively block erratic peers which propagate malformed transactions to avoid this. If you're going to choose a particular miner, you would have to send the tx directly to his IP address instead of propagating over the network, but then you lose privacy. 
You should note, that just like users could choose to exclude miners, miners could choose to exclude other miners, as long one group of miners has more than half of the total hashrate, they can maintain the longest chain, so your plan could backfire.

In stocks, dividends are the realization of value. If a company never pays a dividend throughout its existance, and then stops existing, how much was that company worth to the stockholders? 0. The market value of a business is the sum of all its future cash flows (can either be dividends, or earnings which are reinvested, but only with the expectation of increasing value of future dividends) discounted to the present. The market value of a commodity, such as bitcoin, or gold, is just the same, except you only get one cash flow at the moment when you sell, and there are no earnings, only supply/demand dynamics.

Today bitcoin consumes 219KWh of energy per transaction. That's 20TWh per year, or roughly 1 billion dollars per year. 
8x increase in blocksize would mean 8x increase in energy efficiency.
Cost of 8tb hard drive = $200
So, for 1 million dollars we could run 5000 full nodes for 20 years, and make our billion dollar a year ecological footprint 8 times more efficient.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:58:35


That is what predictable means, literally.
The value of a business is the sum of all it's future cash flows discounted back into the present time. If you can correctly predict those future cash-flows, you can perfectly predict the value. Of course value can never be measured to infinite precision because our ability to predict the future is very limited. What I'm trying to convey is the fact that markets go up and down without regard for any fundamental cause that would affect the future cash flows of a business. However, if the fundamentals of business change, the market will react and will tend to reflect the correct value of the stock over time. Price is an instantaneous property of the subjective trade interactions, whereas value is a precise quantity that exists at every moment but can only be measured in hindsight. For instance we can know almost exactly how much coca cola was worth 70 years ago, because today's cash flows discounted back 70 years are negligible. We can compare its value with the price at various times and find significant discrepancy between both quantities.
Price tends to accurately represent value in the long term, as the market averages what everyone's opinion of value is, and as everyone's opinion of such value becomes more and more informed. Since the fundamentals can change, and the value can change with the fundamentals, the markets are always chasing the correct valuation of an asset, but miss-pricing happens all the time, and the efficient market hypothesis is just a theoretical idealization that does not hold true in practice.

LMAO facepalming hard right here. You totally missed the point of my question. You say your evidence for increased market demand is increased price. I'm asking how do you know its not just the decreased supply? Ever heard of the law of supply and demand? There's a reason it's not just called the law of demand. 


Nope. Money is a **collectively** agreed upon system for accounting. If two people agree upon the system, that is just as good as monopoly money. For bitcoin to be money, a large number of people have to agree, not just two. The 100B market cap could reflect a lot more things than the strength of consensus, like for example hysteria, ignorance, greed, and fear of missing out. 
For example, the concensus of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is quickly being replaced in darknet markets by Monero, for example. If the concensus is disrupted, even temporarily, that can kill bitcoin permanently, and with so much innovation in the altcoin space, there is a non zero chance of bitcoin being disrupted to zero. If you compare that for example to rare elements like gold, you will realize that the chance of gold going to zero is much lower, because you cannot fork the elements of the periodic table. Sure, Bitcoin is a great hedge against economic instability in fiat, even better than gold today, but that doesn't mean bitcoin is less risky than the US dollar, not in the short, medium, or long term.
