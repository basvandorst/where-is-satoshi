I don't see how that leads to fair trials though. You will have a hard time explaining to a normal person how the silk road and bitcoin works. If the defendant ends up getting acquitted because the jury doesn't understand the case then it's not justice. If this is about another case where someone scammed people out of money with some technical tricks it can't be in the interest of the public that he gets acquitted just because no one in the jury understands how he did it.

I think it beats having a bunch of random people decide it. They can assign judges who actually know something about the topic of the case. In this example most jury members probably don't know what's going on with all the technical details. How are you supposed to get a fair decision in a situation like that? It's probably also easier to influence jury members with emotional arguments, especially if they have a hard time grasping the case details and have to resort to deciding whether they like the defendant or not.

It could be improved by not letting a bunch of ignorant normal people decide these cases. We don't have juries in Germany and we're doing fine. The jury system is idiotic.

You have 1-3 judges depending on the severity of the case and 2 lay judges. These 3-5 people decide the case. A lay judge is a normal person similar to a jury member, but you have to volunteer and get elected in order to become a lay judge.

It's only free money for the receiver. Everyone else has to read the useless commment.
