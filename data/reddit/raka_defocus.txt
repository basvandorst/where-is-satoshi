Part of bitcoins growth was it's low price. In the 300-400 price range it's going to turn a lot of people away. A lot of people I talk to that aren't into technology or internet culture don't realize that you can buy/use fractions of coins. LTC is still inexpensive enough for the average person to buy a bunch of. If you really don't understand digitial currency amassing whole coins is going to seem more attractive to some people. For example $300.00 will buy one BTC or 72 LTC. I think to uneducated investors 72 seems like a better deal. People are going to look at some of the early adopters of bitcoin who bought and held it and speculate that LTC offers the same opportunity which will ultimately drive the price up. I've been up for 24 hours with 4 hours of sleep so this may not be the best read but I think you get my point.
My other argument would be that LTC could become the Micro-cap of alt currency.

Perceived value is what the floats most of the financial system, stock market and just about every modern fiat currency.  People are investing in bitcoin , because bitcoins can be traded for more dollars than you bought them for. But neither the dollar or the bitcoin has any real value. One is a note that discharges federal debt to you, the other is a small chunk of made up data. The only reason that you can redeem either one of them for any commodity is the perceived value. Go buy a share of BP, take it to their corporate office and try to trade it in for oil, or currency...it's not going to happen but people buy it because they think they own a part of the company which entitles them to a portion of the revenue. But it's just a slip of paper who's price is driven by what people think it's worth.

FTC, NMC sure but I think there's potential for LTC

No it's because bitcoin has shown that virtual currency is valid form of decentralized private competing  currency.
