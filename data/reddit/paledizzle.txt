So what are you supposed to do? There is no way you will get granny in Nebraska using crypto if there is no trust. I understand that bitaddress could be ran by Nazi's but you can't just sit there and think someone is always trying to steal your shit. I think you are more likely to have your house broken into and then have all your shit stolen. Including your offline wallets. And I guarantee if you have put some insane stupid pw on your wallet, it's written down somewhere. If you haven't done that then it's stupid. You can trip and fall at work and forget that pw.

Love me some GunsUnder500!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:56:46
Yes, you can. They take trade ins as well, and can pay with Bitcoin

Seems like a good way to hide the fact you bought a gun from your wife!
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:01:24
Cost and loopholes involved. I want to place one in my good old state of Georgia.

The S&amp;W M&amp;P 22 Handgun does perfect. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:18:56
Why wouldnt it work? Its just a payment method. You still have to pass the background check

Thanks for explaining ncontorno. That makes more sense than the card info being stored on there. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:01:52
What list? That makes no sense. Its just a website that sells guns, not RPG's. Grow up.

could it hit 100k? Just didn't know since there is only around half of the total coins out there now, will it ever get that stupid high?

You know he is making money off this. He can say he is trying to feed the starving children all he wants, but nobody in the US of A gives that much of a shit to be that courteous. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:59:48
Not a scam. The address is in the Terms. They are in Georgia. Yes, its a real store. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:08:12
Thanks guys for the quick reply. Now, how do I get my wife to spread? Solve that 256bit encryption and you will own Richard Branson.

You can purchase thru me, then I ship it to a gun store close to you in PA. They do the ATF paperwork. Depending on your state is whether you need a permit or not. I dont believe you need anything in PA to purchase or own a gun. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:31:39
Sorry. ATF won't allow that. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:28:15
Use another shop!
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:18:35
Yes. Google fiat and all you get is stupid fucking tampon dispensers.

All someone has to do is hack disney. Easier than hacking blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:22:17
Yes, all legal.

But if it hits a ridiculous about, then that would crash the USD. Because there would be so many overnight millionaires that didn't actually work or buy a commodity to do so. At least if they made millions with the stock market, they would have done so with the standard dollar circulated within our market.

Buds still charges stupid CC fees. I doubt they will jump on anytime soon
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:02:42
They take trade ins. Just email them. They can also pay for tradeins with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:31:29


Why do a contact form? I have noticed i get more replies from a real email and phone than a contact form. It makes it more personal and less like a robot.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:30:37
We sell everything. The site is just for inexpensive guns, but you can email me sales and I will look up anything you need and get back VERY quickly. Then you pay with BTC and be on your way to AMERICAN FREEDOM!
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:00:49
I have a box of MagTech I can ship you. $40
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:38:49
Thanks REDDIT users! We have been selling the hell out of guns using Bitcoin as payment! We truly appreciate it. Let us know if you need anything looked up. It doesnt have to be "under $500". We even sold a $2000 shotgun today with BTC!

Nice. My son just found someone else's band on the ground.
