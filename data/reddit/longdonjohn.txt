Bulletproofs are planned for Q1/2018, which will reduce the transaction size a lot. This should also lead to lower fees.

is like of Bitcoin
They split because they were unhappy with the supposed censorship in this subreddit, but they confuse censorship with moderation. Without moderation, this subreddit would be a shithole

How will miners continue to be rewarded in the future, when the block reward drops?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:51
Exchanges are required to do this, because of KYC/AML laws.
Bitcoin doesn't have anonimity but pseudonimity. For anonimity, there are other coins like Monero.

Very unlikely. Banks, Governments and the military rely on this algorithm, so if it was broken, we'd have way bigger problems.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:31:36
Good question. I guess the answer is that the whole ecosystem is still very immature and therefore has opportunities for arbitrage traders.

In europe, I recommend Bitstamp. Only exchange which has the european banking license acquired, as far as I know. This means your funds are insured up to 100$€. Also, their fees are low (0.25%) in comparison to coinbase (1.5%).

As for your coins - right now, the network is pretty congested. Your bitcoins will arrive, once one of the miners has included your friends transaction in a new block. Blocks are generated roughly every 10 minutes and hold between 1k-2k transactions. You can check the status of your transaction in a block explorer like

cool, thanks for the detailed answer!

Does this mean the fees are split between the miners and the lightning nodes?

You can try to trade the highs and lows or HODL. Most of the traders get burned and end up with less coins than before. 
Ask yourself: Where do you see bitcoin in 5 years? If you think it will be significantly higher than today, I suggest to HODL.
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:58:23
if we are cherry-picking dates, why don't you just go back two years instead of one?

Agreed - with Bitcoin being the first deflationary currency, nothing is guaranteed, everything is speculation.


Also agreed. I never said it was a safe investment, it definitely is very high risk and could go to zero any time (highly unlikely but still). That's why you should only invest what you are prepared to lose. 
I just didn't like how you picked the height of the bubble to make your argument ;)
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:08:44
The thing is, you can pick **ANY** point in time in the past and compare it to today and see what the continuous inflation does to your purchasing power. What you did, was pick **ONE** point in time for bitcoin (the height of the last bubble). Not really a fair comparison.
I agree that investing in stocks or other assets would have yielded positive gains, but that's not the point here. Of course the 80% drop of bitcoin was bad. But you had to buy at the very top (after 20x gains in one year) to have your value depreciate that much. If you bought at any time before that, you would have been fine.

Bitstamp, if you're from the EU. You can do a SEPA transaction and they will charge no additional fees, except the 0.25% trading fee which all exchanges have

my bad, the research group called BITCRIME only reacted to a proposal of the European Commission, not the EC itself

How does this compare to Monero's approach?

Sign support/rejection of UASF with your bitcoin address. Adress must contain &gt; 1 BTC. Something like that?

Translated the abstract:
**Conclusion - too early, even for a preliminary rating**
Bitcoin opens a door to an alternative, decentralized financial, economical and societal structure. The potential disruptive consequences are overwhelming. But similarly overwhelming is the complexity of the topic. Therefore, many questionable analogies and misjudgements do exist.
Some time will pass, until the discussion becomes more differentiated. Likewise, the technology will only become established in the next few years. If Bitcoin is still the dominating cryptocurrency by then remains to be seen. 
Pro Bitcoin: Inventors of new technologies can utilize especially high, self-reinforcing network effects. 
Contra Bitcoin: New technologies can have unforeseen problems and can be replaced by more efficient copycats.
**TL;DR:** everyone investing now is still an incredibly early investor, moon in a few years

Only invest what you can afford to lose! Bitcoin could go to 0$ tomorrow (however, that is not likely).
Maybe try putting something like 50$ each month into it? That way, you also avoid buying a majority of your investment at the top.
Also keep reading and informing yourself.
