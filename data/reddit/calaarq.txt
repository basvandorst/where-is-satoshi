Can't believe you had to explain that. This world is doomed.

I like using Purse, so I keep a few bits in coinbase for that. Since I get that functionality, I'm willing to risk a couple hundred bucks.
What about the coinbase vault feature?

Does Trezor pay interest?  Does any wallet/exchange pay interest?
or maybe I should ask it this way... If I am my own bank, how do I pay myself interest?

You can wait, and pay more after it runs up. Or wait some even more for the price to resettle after the halving scuttlebutt subsides.

I'm new to BitCoin, but assume you can send via an email address.  Since I have my same email address associated to many wallets, I'm not sure exactly how that works, but maybe I'm missing a detail, or two.

Why should you never store btc on any exchange?

So, spend $500+ in parts, time, labor, and frustration to obtain a 2% ROI??? Doesn't add up.

It's not what you "changed", it's what you did when you made the first transaction.  Have you verified that you do not have a recurring transaction?

I have the coinbase vault feature, and to get coins out, requires authentication from 2 different emails, and then it takes 3 business days to transfer to my "walkin' around" wallet.
I don't know what storage method they have, but is the concern that a hacker can get directly into that?

Coinbase has a recurring purchase option. Did you check the  "Repeat this buy..." check box?
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:00:04
How about the Coinbase "Vault" feature?

I guess I didn't think about the fox in the hen house.  Good point.
Luckily, the rally is over. :D

Buying more isn't "paying interest". 
I understand many concepts, but this reply isn't one of them.

Assuming that you'll put $1000 into your pocket by selling right now. (Purchase + ROI), you have to ask, do you really NEED it right now? NEED? Not Need or need, NEED!  My guess is no, and all signs point toward upward movement.  
Buy on the rumor, sell on the news: As we ramp up to the Halving, there will, most likely, be an increase. And, when the hype cools off, the drop will begin.  Checkout GeekWeekend's analysis on YouTube.  He breaks down what happened the last time it halved.
But, if you're currently starving, then by all means, eat.

Pretty granular, but don't know if it will satisfy your need.

My bitcoin wallet app, airbitz, has a feature on it that shows local businesses that accept BTC. 
When you get there, blaze it up... the app, I mean.

I watched the video, but am having trouble understanding the correlation you're making. Can you explain more, or direct me to a more comprehensive source.  Thx.

I hate to answer my own question, but... 
The answer is No! It is the opposite. The Earn feature is designed for people that have Amazon gift cards that they would like to Purge. (This should really be called Purge, not earn.) 
Think of it this way: Drug dealers and Hookers are willing to accept food stamps, but they will do so at a Premium.  My guess is that it ranges depending on how good of a customer, or maybe what is expected in return. Heroin might command a higher premium than pot. Who knows.
Anyway, Purse figured out this same thing about Amazon Gift Cards in that they(Purse) can get people to exchange their AGCs for BTCs... at a premium.  The premium they choose is up to them.  
So, you are the Dealer or Hooker in this transaction, in that you are using the slider to "Ask" for the premium, and the "exchanger" can accept the terms of the Purge or keep on walking to the next dealer/hooker.  
(I also saw where Purse tacks on a $5.95 fee, but I'm not sure exactly where that factors in.)
Here's the Purse description: 
I hope this helped you in your quest for allthingsknowledge of BTC.

Ok, but they didn't "Go Scam" as the kids like to say. Pshew. That would hurt my feelings.
