Transferring large sums of  cash is defacto illegal in the US because of civil asset forfeiture. If you are in possession of a large sum of legally acquired cash (more than a few hundred), you should be legitimately worried the police will confiscate it if caught.

[Herring v. United States](
Did the FBI have a valid warrant in another jurisdiction? This is not something the FBI has ever brought up, yet it would be extremely pertinent if they were using the precedent set in Herring v. United States.

For the sake of this post, lets assume a non-US citizen does not have 4th Amendment Protections. I don't believe that is the case, but that is not what I want to discuss in this post.
 * If the feds claim Ross was the operator of the server, then he has 4th Amendment protections as he is a US citizen.
 * If the feds claim SR was operated by someone other than Ross, they have no case against Ross and will have to drop the charges.
Notice how Ross didn't have to say a word in either of those scenarios. The feds can't win with this argument.

Correct. However midpoint nodes which talk to the hidden service have no clue what they are talking to. All they know is a bunch of different nodes are sending data through them.

No. The node that is talking to abc.onion obviously knows the location of abc.onion, but it does not know that it is communicating with abc.onion.
I will explain the chain to the best of my ability. Each new bullet is a new computer in the chain of communication. posted a [more in-depth explanation]( which is better.
* User - This person knows he is going to abc.onion. He types this address into the browser. The browser places several layers of encryption onto a data packet and sends it off to Entrance Node.
* Entrance Node - This node knows that someone at User's IP is sending an encrypted packet. This node does not know any of the contents of the packet and does not know he is connected to an end-user. This node sends it to Midpoint 
* Midpoint  - This node knows Entrance Node sent it an encrypted packet, but does not know that it was sent from an entrance node. It could have been sent from an end user. Midpoint  sends the packet to User Exit Node.
* User Exit Node - This node knows the packet is going to abc.onion. It looks up in the directory and finds a Hidden Service Exit Node. It sends the packet to it.
* Hidden Service Exit Node - This node knows he is a hidden service exit node, however he has no clue what the contents of the packet are or who it came from. He sends the packet onto Midpoint 
* Midpoint  - This node, like Midpoint  has limited knowledge of anything. This node sends the packet off to Hidden Service Entrance Node.
* Hidden Service Entrance Node - Like Entrance Node, this node doesn't know if he is a midpoint node or not. He has no clue what is on either end of his line, he just knows where to send and receive the packet. He forwards the packet off to Hidden Service.
* Hidden Service - Receives the packet, decrypts it, and processes the contents. Hidden Service does not know who sent the packet. Replies go along the chain in reverse.

The US military utilizes Tor as a shield for their imbedded agents. If it was known the US broke Tor, everyone would abandon ship. Connecting to Tor after that would be a give-away you are with the US military...a fact that would be fatal for a spy.
If they did break Tor, they could not let this be known. All evidence in a case like this would have to be parallel construction. Are they willing to loose a valuable tool in order to catch a single free market site? I doubt it.
I am not discrediting the method of attacking Tor. However, they wouldn't use that method to attack DPR in a court case.

The feds revealed their evidence as mandated by law. This included the [SR webserver configuration file]( Since the security expert *does* have access to the evidence, his diagnosis is credible.

The only way you can conduct a search without a warrant is if you have a [exigent circumstance]( It requires "a situation where people are in imminent danger, evidence faces imminent destruction, or a suspect's imminent escape". None of these were the case with the Silk Road server.
Probable cause is not enough to search a server. However, probable cause is enough to get a warrant which allows a search the server.

@_date: 2014-10-08 21:47:47
The burden of proof is on the FBI. They have not shown evidence their method was technically feasible. Is there more to this and they have not presented the evidence? Possibly. But if they don't present that evidence they loose their case.

Then sell off after the conviction. Selling before then means he isn't receiving due process.

[Exclusionary Rule](
In summary, evidence illegally collected is thrown out. Without a valid warrant, the search of the SR server was illegal and thus evidence gathered from that search is thrown out.

Yes. I think treating recreational drugs like alcohol is treated would be the best thing we can do. In particular the less/non-addictive ones like cannabis, lsd, ecstasy, and mushrooms.

This is certainly better than trusting the random guy on a corner. 
What we really need is to legalize so we can increase safety even more.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:20:01
I think treating it like that is the best course of action as any less regulation will get massive push-back from those who are against legalization. After, we can push for lower restrictions.
I would also argue that alcohol has too many restrictions.

It is pretty hard to scam people when there is a built-in escrow system and vendor reviews. Certainly much harder than in-person meets between the two parties.

The approval process for getting a vendor account is non-trivial and expensive on many DNMs.


Basically every DNM has a review system. You can choose to only purchase from vendors that have a large number of good reviews.


Vendors only do well after they have a well-established profile. And, as I said earlier, vendor profiles are generally very pricy (some cost several thousand dollars). It is difficult to just spam new vendor accounts.
