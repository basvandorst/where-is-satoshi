When I say transaction free. I mean no fees on transactions. This might not be true but it seems that blockchain.info charges 0.001 btc or something. I noticed a charge anyway.
Maybe they all charge? I was assuming the open source ones wouldn't.

I hope that banks do not have as much influence over political powers as I  currently think they might (based from the limited amount I know/have read). A recent article on rt  suggests that corporations have the president in their pocket, and there are many instances where big corporation CEO's have back door meetings with politicians in power.
You are suggesting that bankers will invest in bitcoin for its potential profit. I genuinely hope that is the case. That is a more positive ideology towards the banks than I currently share. My current ideology is that private banks have a monopoly on the money supply and therefore control the economy. Please see  for a more professional and detailed explanation. So therefore, if they lose that monopoly, they will not have as much power as they do. I think bitcoin threatens this monopoly.
I would be interested in further debate on the topic.

Very interesting video. I was aware of 'tabloids' and bad journalism, but I was not aware how much is actually just blatant lies. Thank you.

Ye, I'm on blockchain.info at present. For some error I can't get the paper wallet working right now so I was looking for alternatives. bockchain.info also seems to charge fees on transactions?

Armory requires you to download and sync QT though doesn't it? At present my connection is too slow for that.
