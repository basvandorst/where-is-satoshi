Sorry for your loss. I lost a dog to a house fire earlier this year. It's still so difficult to think about her not being here. Best wishes to you and your family.

That would be silly. I don't support them. If someone wants to investigate for themselves why shouldn't they be allowed too?

.... "you gotta admit" you clearly don't know what you're taking about.

Is there a way to deposit more than $500 a day via ach transfer on Gemini?

Bank account. You have to wait for it to clear but the fees are better plus you can get higher limit. 
Honestly I'd check out Gemini, it takes longer to get approved but the fees are waaay better than coinbase.

I know it's extreme. Andreas  Antonopoulos is 100% bitcoin. He even gets paid in btc

Let me save you some time on this front.
1. You won't be able to buy btc with USD on btce.
2. The price differences you see are not real. A number of things could change it such as exchange fees, but more importantly a random bid/ask making it look like an awesome arbitrage opportunity when in reality it's not.
3. You need high liquidity. If it's not trading at well over $100k volume it's not fast enough to get in an out. The longer you wait the more likely the tide shifts.
4. The margins can be razor slim with next to no profits. At the end of the day the more arb taking place only moves the exchanges closer in price which closes your profit gap.
Do arb opportunities exist? Yes, I see them all the time. But I've personally profited more from day trading
