Exactly my thought. Those are basically the people that made this ecosystem.

The great cities of the East are not Podunk. In fact, most of the money that has built up Vancouver came from there. Go to Shanghai, and you'll realize that Vancouver is the real podunk

Not nothing, but these were the guys that dedicated their lives to it. The rest of us HODLers are just barnacles on the side of their ship, let's be honest. Imagine how much risk they took going all in well before it was clear that this would be a big deal. They deserve some respect

all of us. ALLLLLLL of us.... are opportunists here. If we weren't opportunists we wouldn't be in such a speculative industry. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants, and these are the giants in question. As far as them being liars.... that's obviously highly debatable.

No idea bout 40K, talking about "It can't stay above 1k for a day". Bet he wishes he bought in 4 months ago.
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:23:32
Cool. We agree.

It WAS true that the price was hitting resistance at 1k, but using that as some kind of forward prediction mechanism is not reasonable. Personally I think Clif High is high, but that doesn't mean I disagree about rise in BTC. I'd put it at 10k by end of decade unless it's overtaken by something else.
