I agree with you as bitcoin being a new asset class. It's a totally new animale, that I don't think anyone really has a complete grasp on, because in addition to the things you've mentioned, bitcoin can also be a tool. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:19:56
I had all the same criticisms of bitcoin in the past, and after contemplating them for a while I finally came to a particularly special moment of realization. You haven't had the moment of realization yet. The moment you realize that they absolutely can not shut it down, and no matter what bitcoin wins. It's a scary/exciting moment. The implications are profound, and even terrifying. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:52:48


Me too. I think I'm just going to leave things be for now until I'm totally certain. I do think if you send your bitcoin at this point, the bcash will be sent as well if you haven't split them, so be careful if you want that little bonus from selling the bcash.

Use gdax api for the price. Write script that will send bitcoin to an existing gdax account if the condition is met. Then write a bot that will sell the bitcoin once it enters your account on the exchange.

BCH was the easiest money I've ever made. I need elbow orthoscopy and I'll be using money Jihan and Roger gave to me to pay for it in full. Thanks dipshits. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:02:34
There is a minimum fee on coinbase. So for $10 you'll pay $12, so it's like you're paying 20% more per bitcoin. 
Maybe buy $50 every two months if you can swing it. That would be perfectly fine for savings, and I believe it would appreciate faster than a savings account. Then again, it could go to zero, savings accounts probably won't do that. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:21:35
Consider running bitcoin core, it's easy to adjust your fee to whatever you want it to be.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:07:30

lol, well at least there's not a sub full of retards clamoring for 2x AND segwit because of 'satoshi's vision'. If the 2x'ers + segwit exist in substantial numbers, then I don't think they stand a chance. They don't even have a charlatan like Roger Ver to help them out. Bitmain would be no help this time, because they've already demonized segwit, it would be obvious that Jihan just wants to disrupt bitcoin if he just started supporting segwit out of nowhere.

I disagree. I think bitcoin came from one brilliant person's vision. Sure he gained influence from prior attempts at digital currencies, like bitgold and hashcash. One could consider the inventors of those pre-bitcoin predecessors to be part of a group in a sense.

I totally agree. Look at his comment history (If you haven't already) 80% of the posts and comments end with a question mark.

OP lacks manners. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:09:25
Is that because of the issue timezones cause with the code? I watched a youtube video about something along the lines of "how timezones making coding difficult sometimes," wondering if it applies to this timestamp arbitration in bitcoin.

This is like the 'unopened coin roll' scam, where the 'unopened' coin roll' may contain some super valuable rare date coin, so people pay more for the roll while the seller knows all along that there is nothing special in the coin roll. I'll hand it to you, it's pretty clever to apply this scam to broken hard drives and Bitcoin, but come on, use your cleverness to make your money honestly.

From Jihan Wu (the main dude pushing for the fork) pumping BCH on ViaBTC, and from the fact that hardly anyone can deposit it to DUMP the coins for more bitcoin due to a limited number of exchanges accepting deposits, and the extremely slow confirmation times.

The point was to show that thetentacleday is an enemy of bitcoin, trying to introduce ambiguity as to which chain is the real bitcoin.
Now he deleted the original comment because he got exposed. For anyone wondering, the original comment was in defense of shapeshift and keepkey. It's no surprise to me that *enemies of bitcoin* want to defend a company lead and funded by *enemies of bitcoin.*

That is a concern. I personally have never checked myself, and it may even take me a day or so to understand the math/coding to be certain the random number generator is actually random. 
I personally highly doubt someone who were releasing a hardware wallet that intended it to be even nearly as popular as Trezor would be so bold as to publish an open source compromised random number generator. If that were to happen, I think only a few people would lack the foresight to trust the industry standard that is already out and available. You do raise a valid concern about any new hardware wallets that come to market, I agree there.

He was a professor of mathematics at Princeton. I'm fairly certain his math skills were great, it wouldn't take much to learn cryptography with princeton professor level math skills. That is a good point though. Remember that a lot of the cryptography is based on mathematical expressions, ECDSA for example, hence the elliptic curve. 
I also think some people didn't consider Satoshi to be very great at writing code. He had a lot of help on the code part. I believe Satoshi taking influence from hash cash and bit gold plus his addition of proof of work resulted in the concept of bitcoin, the synthesis of these ideas being the genius part. I try to give credit where it is due.

John Nash, Adam Back, Nick Szabo. 
The one I want to be true the most is John Nash. 
John Nash was famous for his contributions to Game theory. The movie 'a beautiful mind' is about him. He is on record talking about the perfect money, and was into austrian economic theory. I'd like to believe that he found the current central banking system to be a rigged game that was fucking over good people. He figured the best way to change the game was to come up with a better game that was not rigged. Then he just gave it to the world for free. John Nash and his wife passed away in a car accident not too long ago.

No, the purpose is to align the incentives of strangers participating in the network, so that it's in everyone's best interest to play by the rules, rather than act nefariously and harm the network. Besides, in regards to energy use,  the endless printing press of the current central banking system has helped facilitate endless wars. I think a new financial order will usher in an era of drastically reduced energy use, simply because the governments of the world will have to ask their citizens if they can go to war like the good old days.

The quote used to support this notion that satoshi wanted to increase the blocksize is commonly taken out of context. The quote is in the context of a discussion on how a blocksize increase *could* be implemented. Some people have taken it as an implication that the block size *should* be increased, but there is never any explicit statements from Satoshi that the blocksize should or must be increased. 
Also, I've heard an argument that a larger blocksize makes bitcoin be digital 'cash,' I have yet to find any reason based on the definition of cash that 1mb blocks or higher fees make bitcoin unqualified to be considered cash. In fact there is no mention of a fee threshold in the definition of cash. The use of the word cash to suggest that bitcoin cash is more closely following the whitepaper than bitcoin does not hold up at all if you do the research. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:50:46
The problem I see with your point of view is that it would be hard to pass the peer review process without some sort of specific mathematical evidence as to why your mystery number of mb increase would be sufficient enough without inflicting any unnecessary burden to network propagation and/or decentralization.

Me too, but I've also developed a lot of admiration for the core devs. When it comes to CS and bitcoin in general, they are highly rational, evidence based, and logical. I actually think it's funny when people say the core devs didn't consider X or Y alternatives, of coarse they considered the fucking alternatives, they just determined that the alternatives were not as good as segwit + lightning! Besides, all the arguments for a simple max block size increase are specious anyway. 
Lets see, will the shill replies be gish-galloping, ad hominem, goalpost moving, poisoning the well, techno babble, or some fucked up combination of every possible fallacy? Tell me about satoshi's vision someone. Blockstream? All banks are evil, axa invested in blockstream, therefore blockstream must be evil...blah blah blah.

I wondered the same thing when I first started. I do think there are many who do not spend, which is fine because as long as a substantial amount of people spend bitcoin for legal transactions, then bitcoin can still just be a store of value to those who wish not to spend (for now). 
I am such a big fan of bitcoin, I actually feel that it is my duty to spend. The project has a lot of meaning in terms of individual liberty, and I want to see it succeed, as do many others like me.

Hopefully the in-game currency of some popular video game. That would be cool. 
I don't see why it couldn't be used to keep track of stock trades, or other important transactions. I also see (Maybe further out than 5 years) people buying stock in major companies without a middleman, and then being able to send stock to someone else as if it were an email. It would also allow for further subdivision of shares, beyond the initial unit value of 1. So you could buy .002 shares of chevron.

I was just thinking about how the bitcoin I made from selling the recent shitcoin was just too much money too easy...it felt too good to be true. Then I thought about it and wondered if perhaps the hardforks were a psi-op to get the users to like hard forks, because they make money...then people would start to have an incentive to go against the interest of the main chain. However, I do feel like most people understand that short term gains from selling shitcoins from a propped up hardfork do not outweigh the long term gains of a successful bitcoin that dominates the world. Luckily we also have utility on ourside since lightning is a game changer, sure, 2x could have lightning too, but there really is no conceivable way to do a sybil attack where you have a fake 'community' that wants both segwit and larger blocks. Larger blocks was appealing to some, and segwit to others, I see no unique value to having both, and there's no way to set up satoshi's vision arguments for segwit2x, because that has already been used to bash segwit. Anyway, I'm still totally confident that bitcoin is unstoppable, but it's fun to think about possible attack vectors.

What's well off? 
I knew bitcoin was a high risk investment. I believed in the technology, but was not willing to expose myself to the risk to the point where -had bitcoin gone the other direction- I'd substantially negatively effect my life.
I invested a good amount of money, enough where if I had lost it, it would have sucked a bit, but not so much that it would fuck me over. 
I am up tens of thousands of dollars, which did not make me rich, but it did allow me to buy a reliable truck, which I needed to get a specific job that I wanted, which will lead me down the career path that I've been wanting to go down. I also still hold a comfortable amount of bitcoin, on top of the truck the profit from the sales covered my initial investment, so my bitcoin holdings are free, and are no longer a risk at all. 
Bitcoin did improve my life, and it will help me out in the future, but even though I believed in the technology, I was not willing to invest more than I was willing to lose :)

Listing the chain with the PoW that includes a bunch of malicious miners who like to exert their will via 51% attack doesn't make sense, but like you said, they're certainly capable of eschewing common sense. 
Since this is all based on conjecture, why not consider the possibility that people might rather use the chain with double spends than remain on a chain with miners who will destroy the value of the currency through 51% double-spend attacks, just so the malicious miners get their way?  In which case, the side that survives is the one people choose to use, not which one the miners choose not to attack.

When Jihan plays his hand and switches over to mine the 2x chain, it would be a great time to 51% BCH. That's how you play the game.

Why would that matter? The attackers are mostly mining Bcash now anyway. 
Which gives me an idea...
The best time to attack Bcash, is when Jihan switches his Hash power over to mine 2x. It would be the perfect opportunity to 51% attack Bcash, and fork it into oblivion.

Short answer, Yes. Long answer, no, I think privacy measures won't be implemented like monero, but there will be optional privacy features that serve the same function, and work as well, maybe even better. To be honest I don't really know much about monero (and I don't care).
Moreover, bitcoin will remain a public ledger. The obfuscation of one's identity will probably be left to the user. This will aid in having governments accept and allow it to be used as currency. Bitcoin will be legal, but it will probably be illegal to obscure your identity, but still very easy to do if you want to take on the risk.

I think you're misconstruing Dr. Pony's point. 
Dr. pony is basically saying "if the miners have the most control of consensus in bitcoin, do they get to have their say over things like the block reward?" 
The implication there is that if miners have the most control over consensus, then bitcoin is broken, because the miners control the game. Thankfully, the miners do not have the most control of consensus in bitcoin.

My point is this implementation is like a guy and some of his buddies.

They have Jeff 'no commits' Garzik, and an army of businesses that stand to lose out if lightning rolls out, and schnorr signatures are implemented. Not to mention some of the alts out there, with armies of bagholders and pump artists, foaming at the mouth, who all know bitcoin will offer everything their alts offer soon, well, everything of any value. Privacy features, check. Smart contracts, check. It's going to be a massacre.

This isn't a court of law. You aren't innocent until proven guilty on the internet. Many people, like myself, find that it's probable that bitmain is supporting the price, we base this on the circumstantial evidence. Things like putting back doors in their miners, mining empty blocks -which suggest asicboost use- while pushing for larger blocks at the same time in order to impede the implementation of segwit, then hard forking with little community support to directly compete with bitcoin, as 'bitcoin.'
Jihan's behavior has led me to always assume the worst about him to be true. I find the burden of proof to be on his shoulders to provide unquestionable proof that he is not supporting the price of bitcoin cash. After all, he doesn't mind supporting it with hash power *at a loss*, it doesn't seem unlikely that he wouldn't support the price with his own money 
People like Jihan no longer get the benefit of the doubt from people like myself. That privilege is only provided to those who have earned my trust, not to those who act in ways that make me question how trustworthy they really are.

For the 10th time, It does not explicitly state that they are going to run 2x. It says they are going to support the activation of 2x.

It seems like it would be in the miner's rational self interest to mine valid blocks. The nodes decide which blocks are valid. 


You're right, the core devs can't command them to follow the rules, but if they want to mine bitcoin, they have to follow the rules. 
Let me ask you something, do you think bitcoin relies on users and node operators pursuing their rational self interest? Why or why not?

Lets put it this way. Suppose I want to hard fork bitcoin, and I'm the only person who's going to run and mine the software, because the software gives me 25,000 extra BTC after the fork. I don't offer replay protection. For some reason coinbase says they'll agree to support my upgrade. I run a node, coinbase runs a node completely independently from their systems, maybe even brian just running one at home. Will I now be able to disrupt coinbase? 
Edit: "We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades" are there no ways that you can think of, where coinbase could 'support' the upgrades, but prevent getting themselves in trouble with the lack of replay protection? The word support was not defined in the agreement, nor does it even read like a legal contract. Businesses use contracts drafted by lawyers for important reasons... 
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:14:32

And what I'm trying to say is that there is difference between 'agreeing to activate,' and 'agreeing to support the activation of.' Do those two statements mean the same thing to you? 
Because the NY agreement states that coinbase agreed to support the activation of the hard fork, which would be different than agreeing to activate it. Do you see where I'm coming from? It's pedantic, I know, but it's an important difference. The two statements carry different possible implications.

Coinbase can support 2x by running a node, that node doesn't have to touch any of their current services. They've fulfilled their part of the NY deal with that. They can still choose to only offer the non 'upgraded' version to their customers, there is no binding clause in the agreement that legally obligates them to run 2x as their primary bitcoin service, or any service at all if you read the agreement carefully. 
(They could even just pay someone's electric bill, who was running 2x, and still have been supporting the activation of the upgrade)

I would not piss on scam artists like them to put out a fire. The thing about the current scam artists, is that they're public figures, and *people know* they're trying to make a buck off ruining the world's chance at financial freedom...Do they really understand the implications of their offences?

I'll just go back to using local bitcoins. I don't think there's much of a chance coinbase will do that, they didn't support eth classic, and overall they're pretty based and understand what's going on. Also, with bitpay forfiting their market share by supporting 2x, it's just there for coinbase to take at this point. I'm sure many like myself have stopped purchasing from merchants that only use bitpay, and will resume when coinbase picks up the slack, after their business fails due to the genius of their management. Tony, where you at dawg?
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:27:50
If the lack of replay protection forces them to use 2x, then the fact that they support the NY agreement doesn't make any difference as to weather or not they run 2x in place of bitcoin.

"We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol"
Like I said, it depends on what they meant by 'support.' Which was not defined in the agreement. They can say they'll support it, but that doesn't mean they have any legal obligation to include it in coinbase services.
I could say I'm going to agree to support the 2x protocol, and just buy Garzic an in-and-out double-double. You're welcome for the support, via supplying the valley's best double cheeseburger to the lead developer, so he's not without lunch, so he can code.

He seems to be on the no2x train, but in another thread he was relentless in his conviction that coinbase has made an explicit statement that they would implement 2x on their platform, in spite of the fact that I showed him that there is no clause in the ny agreement requiring coinbase to do so. Any explanation I provided seemed to be intentionally overlooked, and a number of times he simply replied "I don't speak derp," and then on another occasion tried to frame me as a BCH/BU supporter. Very strange behavior.

I think in this browser it would be good to not allow users to enter how much bitcoin they are going to send. They should have to click on values, to send them. That way they avoid sending the wrong amount (too much). 
Want to buy a DVD, it's .0005 BTC. You click the number and press buy.

Coinbase is a good place to start. You can buy/sell with them, plus your account will have a 'wallet.' I put the wallet in quotes because technically on coinbase you don't control the private keys, which means you don't really control your bitcoins, which means technically you don't really own them. That brings me to the next part...
After you get started with coinbase you're going to want to get an actual wallet where you have the private keys. I believe electrum is the go-to great wallet for PC, and I really like samurai wallet for mobile. 
After you get your wallet, you can practice sending/receiving by sending from your coinbase 'wallet' to your electrum wallet. 
Then you can learn how to back up your wallet, there are numerous guides out there. Check youtube. 
If your going to buy a substantial amount of bitcoin, get a hardware wallet like trezor or a ledger nano s. You'll want to have enough bitcoin to justify paying the $80 for the hardware wallet (or whatever they cost, I don't know). Hardware wallets are great, and they're pretty futuristic and cool IMO. 
I hope that helps. 
Oh and if you really want your bitcoin now, use local bitcoins dot com, and do a cash transaction in person. You will pay a premium, but there won't be much wait time like with coinbase. Your first coinbase purchase will take about a week to go through, and I'd give it a 50% chance of being cancelled. For some reason they cancel a lot of first purchases on new accounts, I'm pretty sure its for fraud prevention.

@_date: 2017-10-01 02:21:58
Wait... what? You've got me confused with rbtc schmucks/scoundrels. 
Allow me to explain my reasoning. This whole 'coinbase is going to switch to 2x' thing has been pushed as a certainty for the last couple days. I think the point is to scare people into selling their BTC. I'm just trying to clear the air, and state the facts, without assumptions regarding an this stupid ny agreement. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:39:11

Re read our conversation. I explained the difference about agreeing to upgrade a blockchain, and agreeing to implement that upgrade on their platform. You seem to want to willingly overlook that fact, it's obvious to anyone reading this BTW. You should probably just delete all your comments, you're just making yourself look bad.

Jihan would, but he's an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:31:05
No I don't think you're inconsistent, I just interpreted from our other conversation, that your argument was "coinbase agreed to support the ny agreement, therefore they will run 2x" but my understanding now is that you're saying that 'because there is no replay protection, coinbase must run 2x regardless of weather they agree or not.'
The first point, I would (and did) argue with, the second point, I would hesitate to argue with you because i'm not well versed in the technical aspects of replay attacks and running exchanges. 
**Edit: If what you're saying is that they have no choice but to run 2x, why would you say this?**
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:57:42


They never said they would give you both coins. Source?
Edit: They did say they would offer both coins, if certain condition are met, and sometime before Jan 1st 2018. I responded to this comment, because it sounds like the commentor is saying that coinbase didn't keep their word. They still have time to follow through. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 02:07:58
Oh ok, that's more clear now that you edited your comment from just "derp." Great argument BTW.
Are you consciously trying to overlook the difference between agreeing to activate a protocol upgrade, and agreeing to run said upgrade on one's platform?

What, you think that because they called it an upgrade, that they have to implement it on their platform. Are you retarded? 
Edit: this is in response to the original pre-edited comment "The fact that you call it an 'upgrade' betrays your position"

Being on the list of supporters for the NYA does not carry any legal requirement for coinbase to use 2x after the fork. They also haven't made any official statements, so I would just disregard this post all together, although I do recommend not leaving your bitcoins on coinbase in any case. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:57:34
You're not reinventing anything, you want to take a shortcut by asking someone else to explain something to you. That's fine, you might learn more if you go do the footwork, and you might not have to deal with any bias. Good luck.

I would not value bitcoin if the people who were mining it, and offered services for it, had control over the rules. Bitcoin is the people's money, in a way it's kindof like a constitutional republic. The core protocol being the constitution, which in the US, is quite hard to change.

Mobile wallet, yes, and they were one of the first (if not the first) wallet to add segwit support, so they get my vote. Plus they have some privacy features. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:27:22


Actually, based on their lack of a explicit statement, that's not the only thing one can assume. One can also assume after reading the text of the NY agreement, that they are under no obligation to do so. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:46:00

Coinbase never explicitly agreed to implement the 2x chain on their platform, BTW. I just don't want to get too off track. ;)

It won't do any damage, the notion that 2x will damage bitcoin is all based on a poorly written agreement that nobody can enforce, called the New York agreement.

Does a hard fork not result in 2 chains? You run the 2nd chain on a node in your utility closet, completely isolated from any coinbase services.  Agreement fulfilled.

I think it has something to do with the size of the eth blockchain, its rate of growth, and the number of nodes that are dropping out due to the size/ rate of growth of the chain. I could be wrong, but that's just what I gathered from the post and the link.

The group that has been pumping these alts are slowly divesting because Segwit is going to make Bitcoin great again. They'll start dumping their alts soon. Sorry to all the bag holders. I just hope I have the eth chart up and my lotion ready for the crash to sub $20.
Edit: Bitcoin has always been great. ;)
