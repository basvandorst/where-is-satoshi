So, where will this end? To me looks like a fight on consuming energy using the excuse of "security". That only escalates into consuming more and more energy to stay in front of others. Does not sound efficient at all. And seems many don't care at all because all they think is the money they generate in the process!

I wish there was an easier way of handling this. Because average joe gets discouraged by all this mambo-jambo stats. :P

You can't aspect price rise without improving Bitcoin. It needs regulation and a better blockchain system. Until those are clear... it's a jungle. Like it is now.

What a waste of electrical power. I mean, for the rest of the fellows that try to compete with this thing. 
Quite stupid, if you ask me. We are doomed because we invent such greedy systems.

I like how everybody knows what is weak, what is strong and what is good. This only after the shit hits the fan.

It's more easy to vote than giving a constructive reply. 
There are many bitcoin zealots that downvote anything they see as negative to bitcoin. 
This pretty much disgusts me and made me a bad impression about this sub. And about Bitcoin.
People seem to prefer to hide bad stuff under the rug.

this is bs. bitcoin and altcoins are cryptocoins. only together they will succed!

Because the mining concept is silly. Cryptocoins need a better system to work. Now they work on energy waste. Really dumb. We'll laugh when will think about this in the future.
