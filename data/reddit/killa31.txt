@_date: 2019-07-14 17:08:13
you mean like he did when the price was $100 a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:13:08
If you guys dont think he's in bitcoin already take a look at the date and time this came out. 
Talking bad about something and announcing it to the world just legitimized Bitcoin and will ultimately pump his bags. 
What were you expecting, him to talk shit to about the dollar? No instead talk good about the dollar give a reference to Bitcoin under cover and say it's printed out of "thin air" when everyone already knows that the dollar is printed exactly like that. 
Everything is calculated in politics, I dont care if you like Trump or not, but the President announcing Bitcoin is a huge step towards adoption even if he said he doesn't like it.

I suggest everyone watch Mr. Antonopolus's reply on why we shouldn't want an ETF, even if it allows lots of money to come in.
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:11:03
I just suggest everyone watching Mr. Antonopolus and seeing what he says about ETF's. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:13:58
I dont understand big wallets like this, if it were me, and I had 30k BTC I would at least make a few wallets, maybe put a 1000 in each. I wouldnt feel comfortable having that amount in one address. But thats just me, and just think 10 years ago that may have only cost them a 10 bucks. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:36:45
I just want everyone to realize etfs are something we don't want. Please don't take my word for it take Mr Antonopolus's advice on the subject. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:30:23

Every single blackout game I play I let everyone to know to "Buy Bitcoin", where else, me being a lowly human am I going to get that kind of platform?
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:18:56
And why do we want a etf again??? we really dont want the govt or businesses that work hand in hand with the govt to control huge amounts of bitcoin right?

@_date: 2018-10-25 02:35:17
I never said to ban it, I just said we shouldn't be looking forward to Etfs. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:18:33
But where does the bitcoin that you pay to the person come from?
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:27:35
well kick me in the dick and call me mick, Im just an old man with a keyboard
@_date: 2018-10-24 19:25:19
I really believe they will not buy bitcoin but create their own coin. Im bullish bitcoin only if it stays out of the hands of the government. People should own their own keys.

Tylers "Jar Jar Binks" Jenks. I love how he has no Skin in the game yet still talks about Bitcoin Daily...
@_date: 2019-04-27 16:21:36
Ok by your logic everyone should stop what theyre doing and just work on Bitcoin.

Least it starts
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:03:54
I think if banks actually cared they would make legislation against Bitcoin even more. They either dont know about it or they are buying it all up when it dumps and they dont really care how low it goes since they are able to just print more money. 1 billion dollars is nothing to them. They will manipulate bitcoin to 100k then drop it to 1k and watch everyone run while they buy up more and more until they kill it. This is why you dont sell, EVER!
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:13:51
If you spent money that you need to live, on bitcoin, then that's already a problem. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:19:42
That makes sense
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:44:52
By the way everyone this is just FUD. This is from the floods last year in china 
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:39:05

@_date: 2018-11-24 17:02:17
What? How
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:45:56
Also mining asteroids will soon be a thing (next 100 years) Bitcoin will still only have 21 million
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:52:05
They will try to derail bitcoin I guarantee it. People are starting to throw millions/billions at bitcoin too, i just hope that actual ppl are getting them instead of ppl with large amounts of cash, which then can buy up the little guys bitcoin to feed his family, and then have to buy it at a more expensive price. I just dont see how Bitcoin is sustainable with all the fees that are currently given to be able to be used as a form of real currency other than a few stores here and there. Just my opinion though. I currently have 2 btc but I dont think it will exceed 3k or even 500k by 2020 like Mcafee stated yesterday, theres nothing to back it and theres to many fees to be beneficial to the average folk. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:26:29
5x highly unlikely LOL

Promoting a scam in any way shape or form means I won't listen or watch you ever again
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:29:39
Do what I do. Make a reoccuring Payment on coinbase (yes they are shit but its easy) of some money that you have extra each month. Put 10% in for trading and the rest is for the hodl. Ive accrued some btc by doin this and its seems to have really paid off. I had been doing it since july of last year.
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:47:43
He promoted Bitconnect. Just sayin
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:07:59
Theyre trying to charge me $4.00 to transfer from my coinbase account to my coinbase.pro account...
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:29:35
Is it still working? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:38:40
Give a man a SATOSHI and you feed him for a day;
teach a man about Bitcoin and you feed him for a lifetime
