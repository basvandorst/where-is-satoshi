Unless someone has bought the bitcoins cash its not fucking impossible to just follow the blockchain as it were. Obama is completely over his head here on his statement and not informed well enough. There have been examples from computer scientist before following the blockchain and being able to identify people, although it took time.
Of course someone could buy coins cash without giving up any details to a official exchange. But for the large fish this would be incredibly hard, unless they were running a drug cartel.

I think this price of fees is a real issue with the network right now. I propose a rule change where all nodes are mandated to inform all their peers at what price they would include a transaction into the next block, and a function where it is possible to turn this off, given that the node is not mining. In that way it would be possible to build something akin to a depth chart where the price of a transaction at any given time can be observed.

Exactly, I believe launching a product to appeal to the cryptocurrency community would work as a insurance strategy, ensuring that they would not go bankrupt. But you are absolutely correct. They are too lazy to innovate. They probably don't perceive the risk of substitution which is here, and evolving getting better day by day. So they will likely go bankrupt or much smaller if the bitcoin project succeeds. Btw, this anti-innovation disease of big companies is called position captivity.

It does not really matter. If usability increases it is very much likely that the value increases too. Which makes it cheaper to set up mining operations. As the costs are paid in fiat and profits in bitcoin.
Thing is if the incentive in Bitcoin drop with say 10% and price increases with 20%. There is likely to be more miners.
Furthermore there will always be miners that can profit. As long as some miners can turn a profit they will mine. It does not really matter when they have committed capital (mining machines) if the profit goes from 30% to 25% on invested capital. There is still profit to be made. So you should view mining as a marketplace more than anything. Even if the hashpower drops by 10% there is still no single entity with enough mining power to make bitcoin unsafe. Market forces ensures maximum mining at all times. If new and better mining chips are made they are immediately adopted and so on. It does not really matter if one miner suddenly finds the practice unprofitable as long as someone else can do it better, and thus find it profitable. This is exchange of miners is happening real time all the time in favor of maximum security.

Every libertarian party has different planks. Why do you use your time in a negative focus?
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:56:44
Never heard a libertarian promote that anyone should have access to drugs. But do believe that grown-ups should be able to practice self-ownership.
It seems that the other things you point out is easily solved by making rules or regulations if you wish, that holds individuals responsible for their actions. Say for example in the case of pollution of water which has previously been beneficial to someone. The polluters in that case must be held responsible for their destruction in this case in my opinion.
In short a lot of rules and laws can be debated, but whatever limitations or freedoms that are put in place. The old saying "with great power comes great responsibility" still holds true. All serious libertarians I know share this view. As those most regular people.

All you need to define the theory is available. I have thought about it. Research by XBT Provider AB (Bitcoin ETN company) has shown that metcalfe's law ([Here]( can explain over 90% of the price of bitcoin in regression analysis. 
Further if we explore macroeconomics theory of currency, one might find it is severely lacking. It essentially explains the value of some good in relation to another, ie. how many units of apples is needed to substitute a banana when considering the price of either. [Macroeconomic theory](
But for anyone familiar with network valuation theory this makes absolutely no sense. If you consider the fact that at any given time in an economy you could have three providers who also want what one other actor have. But no one trust each other. Example A wants what B has, B wants what C has and finally C wants what A has. There is no exchange possible. But when you introduce currency which all actors trust they can all trade. This is what is missing IMO. The understanding of currencies as networks.
If I were doing doctors studies in macroeconomics I would start here.
EDIT: Well aware that this approach defies PPP.

No, I am assuming there is a market failure. Closest bid in the future would be 25.000 USD for 1 BTC equivalent. At the same time the closest ask in the BTC market for 1 BTC is 15.000 USD. You can simply sell one future for 1BTC equivalent and buy one 1 BTC, and thereby lock in the difference. Assuming you can hold on to the contract, aka. stay within margin. and sell the Bitcoin at the settlement date for the settlement price.

it is called arbitrage. and this is very true. Hence we will have extreme volume. What is also true is the macroeconomic laws that underpins the value of a currency. Which states that price times volume must equal turnover times units of currency. Take that into account and you will understand that since the units of bitcoin are limited the price must increase, when people start arbitrage.

The highest bidder for opening a channel so to speak is likely the market actors with the highest need for low fee transactions. Thus it will make sense for some market participant to pay the extreme fee at any given time. Therefore they will free up the block space immensely at first. And in turn making it more affordable for anyone else to open a channel. And this process will go on until equilibrium is reached.

It probably will dip at this point. (hopefully, else the bubble will pop at next dip.) We need to have a cycle of people realizing gains and then the trend of a sharp strong decline followed by the trend continuing. And then followed by regret from the people who realized their fake money gains. So do not sell zoom out on the graph and see that this has happened three times the last 2 years.

The futures traders will arbitrage the "interest rate" indicated by the future, if this reaches a certain level say 5% per year, it exceeds the traders likely 3% cost of capital therefore he/she should sell futures using loaned money as security for it and buy the underlying asset, thereby gaining arbitrage profit and making the market for us.

It is possible but as you say there is not enough Bitcoin being lent. So for this doomsday scenario to occur the people who own the underlying right now have to lend en masse. Which is unlikely to happen. I think it is much more likely to see the futures skyrocket and products like GBTC and others will meet its price. Then the investors will see an upside in the underlying compared to the futures and they will sell overpriced futures to buy actual bitcoin. So all in all a "tail wagging the dog" scenario where all price gaps will be closed, and price massively increase and volatility slowly going down, as well as the rate of return.

Keep in mind the future is cash settled. So you would sell immediately your future and buy corresponding BTC. And when the future contract rolls sell BTC at settlement price. There is no volatility risk as long as the position equal the same exact exposure to Bitcoin and the future and bitcoin market will behave normally after your execution. Then you have just locked in 10k

His points are good. But ETFs will probably be the thing that gets the mainstream adoption S-curve going down the line. As long as there is an easy way to adopt for both buyers and sellers (I think this is coming along nicely, and honestly the people creating and coding in this space are my heroes. Thank you!), as well as a good solution for private individuals to store their funds securely without intermediary. People who adopt Bitcoin and put in an effort to understand it. Also come to understand things like credit risk with ETNs and the likes that mostly only people working in the markets think about. And this is probably the number one factor that propels bitcoin forward. The simple truth about how massively complex the financial markets have become and the truth about the monetary system as a whole. This may not ensure that Bitcoin succeeds. But if Bitcoin or an equivalent sound money platform gets mainstream adoption there will be no more fiat currency.
We may not win. But they must lose! As we progress this will become increasingly clear!

You just proved my point. Like Facebook their servers are simply worth what they cost to make. But since they are used to employ facebooks network on they become infinitely more valuable. But it does not have any inherent value so to speak.
Same goes with Bitcoin, it is just like fiat in a way. It has value because we, the network say it has value. And when we compare the two it is very clear what is the best money. Therefore our network will grow, and so will its value.
In truth it is the consensual agreement between the people in the network that gives bitcoin its value. As you probably know a UTXO is simply a piece of data that proves you can make it appear inside a different box essentially.
The same thing goes for a lot of different things too. For example government, there is no inherent value in it. It is the people's coercion or agreement that gives it value. One may have a collective agreement on taxing the people to provide a police force through the government, because the people think that safety is valuable (yet still that too is just an opinion). And some people disagree with the concept other people have of safety, for example is it safety to have a armed guy take plants from people who pose no threat to others, is that valuable? Probably not to the people who just want to be physically safe. But for some reason the police are tasked to do this.
Why? Because a network of people with the power to task them with it, holds the power to say that it is valuable.
Like we hold the power to buy Bitcoin and say it is valuable.

I believe that a mortgage tranche with a good rating bbb+ and up would go at around 4%, assuming normal conditions in a full reserve system. Around 0,5% stable deflation and decent growth.
So depending on my situation I would probably lend at around 4-6%, while trying to achieve around 5% total portfolio return.
That being said, this is only under normal deflation of around 0,5%, under a sparsely occuring inflation crisis I would lend at a higher rates to low risk tranches.
EDIT: I think you just explained how lending for the purpose of consumption would be a thing of a past :D I believe that to be a great thing personally.

To all of those thinking this automatically means that there will be a higher price. also known as the labor theory of value. This is not true. The correct interpretation is that the market of miners as a whole will have a net zero profit in the long-term. Meaning miners could increase their investment even if their operation at the time they do so is not profitable. in the hope of it becoming so. Furthermore those investing now are likely also holding better equipment than what was previously used for mining. So they may bet that they will push other miners out of the market and increase their share of bitcoin production and base their profit calculation of off that. This makes more sense than believing in the stupid marxist notion that everything is only worth the value of the labor put into it. The world is not that static, the world is dynamic.

You can use the same models and systems to calculate and coordinate every resource the exact same way you calculate their value.

an active position does not need a buyer/seller. it is active. Good example is when you want to short something. You borrow the underlying asset and then sell it. Your position to be opened only needs a buyer at the point of open. and again a seller at the time of close.

See what you say about consumption driving the economy. But I would say that any such statement should be coupled with the explanation that when credit is issued for the purpose of buying consumer goods, then that part of growth must be short lived. It seems obvious that we can't consume beyond our means for too long. It must end with increasing interest rates as credit become more scarce, and the resulting pain from that must be paid both in reduced consumption as well as interest.

If a pool has 51% and use it for malicious reasons there is no reason to mine at the current time. As a hard fork would most likely be put in place to de-validate all blocks mined after said malicious activities happend on the chain.

Well right now we are in a downtrend mainly because of higher acceptance through businesses. And as we know they sell all or fractions of their coins right away. When these businesses start to transact with each other with BTC then the price will rise dramatically in a short time period. So the time to buy is now really. There may not be a more perfect time.

It depends. If the results skew the view on politics in such a way that SEC controlled crypto is the only PC opinion then it is bad. But if it is just the US enforcing the law it is fine, really it just makes sense. Especially now that they know a lot US citizens hold btc, and the reason manipulation is illegal is because it defrauds the investors in the asset in question. But then again I am still waiting for them to probe the federal reserve for the same reason.

There is no need to increase peooles wages if the money supply is static. Assuming wages are fair in the first place. The theory is simple.

In a logical world with our banking system, yes probably. Maybe then you wouldn't technically lend your money to the bank. Rather pay them for safegaurding, which makes more sense in my opinion. But in our world almost all bank account states that you lend the bank the money you debit "your" account. It usually does not state any limitation as to what the bank can do with this debt, therefore there are none. It is your money but you lent it do them. So if someone steals it from them, they are not responsible. Although they may be responsible for reimbursing you.

No, I just mine vertcoin I don't convert them. Because the scrypt miners haven't been outrun by the ASICs yet. But when that happens I see vertcoin replacing Litecoin. Then I maybe consider converting or spending the vertcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:47:27
I can see that. But still I think we should impose post-quantum crypto to secure the private keys today.

I mean you only have the miner client connect to a modified version of p2pool ( as in a node accepting outside miners.) And that modified version should even out all miners on the nodes in the network, making every node have about the same hashrate, making it more or less fair. Only issue with this is that every node should have the same fee percentage to make it all fair.

Not necessarily but it has to be based on something with intrinsic value. But I feel as though they may want to restart the cycle and maybe make up a Euro standard or similar.

You can also see that some of their predictions has yet to come true. But seems to be right around the corner today. Like the android Wear platform emerging in the last few months. I kind of think that it will at least take 30 years before cryptocurrency completely takes over.

Do not under any circumstance reach out for "professional" Help. Keep the documents safe. Preferably in a fire/water-proof environment, and complete darkness. This is how I treat these types of documents. He may also have copies of these same documents in another place. Check bank boxes, if it is worth a lot there may be duplicates in more than one bank box. I am 17 years old, so if I can figure this out you should be able to do the same. Once again, trust no-one.

To answer your question. Yes, you can download it online. Using bitcoin or an unofficial service. And yes, it is also store in all mining nodes. If you choose to import a unofficial blockchain file into your wallet, it will be validated. If you have the Bitcoin core wallet. Your blockchain file(s) can be found at \%appdata%\bitcoin as standard on Windows machines. Do not tamper with this directory though. As it may result in loss.

If the blockchain consist of the file and accepted nodes. And accepted nodes are the only ones who you can connect to. The server is just the first node. You pay to be a accepted node in other words.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:29:54
You didn't get it. I am talking about the protocol not the currency. What is minted is the file. And what is confirmed is the nodes.

That's a really forced way to mention it too. Made me laugh.

No but it makes a incentive for hosting a node. And also it is needed when p2pool reaches critical mass.

I just read up on gridcoin. But see a vulnerabillity right a way. It states that if you mine with BOINC running at 100% utilazation you gain 150coins per block instead of 5. But if a pool is running BOINC at 100% and people point miners to said pool. There is only 1 computer running BOINC...

@_date: 2014-01-09 18:22:50
wouldn't it be easier to make p2pool have a list of all p2pools nearby and connect to the closest and mine on that assuming it has a responsible fee? Should work splendidly if us who aren't idiots host some p2pools. It should of course take into account the hashrate on  the pool in question and the amount of users there. So if each p2pool server would know about each other and agreed to send users where there aren't it should work. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:21:13
Do you think it is volatile at that point? No.

Private keys are secured with something called "elliptic curve cryptography" and with something called a "quantum computer" you can instantly see whats behind the elliptic curve cryptography. IE, I could see your private key just by knowing your public key.

I am happy for you. Also if you know a thing or two about the protocol you would know that banks are not needed. The function we need is loans for people. Why not make a loan from a global group of lenders? Why not a decentralized "lenders/borrowers app" based on the side-chain concept? Banks have become obsolete in this information age.

So basically the same problem that the colored coins projects got into then? I think it is time for some change regarding all this. What do you think would work as the better implementation treechains or just allowing for pointers in the transaction script?

step 1: do 512 coin tosses. one side representing a character or a number combinations possibly representing strings..
step 2: Think of 20 words you would never use.
step 3: take what you have from step 1. and encrypt what you have from 2 with sha 512(salted with 1)
step 4: make a private key with the result in an completely offline environment. testing the RNG of the machine in question.
step 5: write down/ generate QR of the key(s). with the same precautions as in step 4.
step 6: Hide it!

Bitcoin is not lawless. The code is very explicitly only possible to work if said rules/laws are in effect, or else you are kicked out of the system. The only thing is that people don't take into account the none written rule. Which says trust no one, not even your dog. People trusted Mark Karpeles.

If you just want to buy BTC exposure you should consider XBT provider. If you have access to Nasdaq OMX exchange. If this is not set up for you, a bank transfer to bitstamp or kraken or some other EU bitcoin exchange would likely be best if you are going to hold for a long time.
Also keep in mind security. If you don´t have the private key to where your coins are stored you do not own the coins, someone else do. So do you trust strangers with your money? is a question to keep in mind.

I think you are seeing this wrong. The unit of exchange doesn't change anything. It just means that all goods and services can be bought for the same unit of exchange worldwide. Countries will still compete on costs when they are weak. Because in strong economies we enjoy more goods and services for that to continue we must be paid accordingly.
As for the european crisis the issues have occurred due to politics not the currency. The reason for the immense over-spending of governments in the EU was caused by the fact that the financial world gave the same interest rate to all euro countries while a very stupid decision this is what made the greeks issues possible. Greece as an example had much cheaper credit available to them after implementing the euro which is completely insane. In a functioning society where we have a global currency the market must be able to charge the interest appropriate accounting for risk.

Have tried to contact the IRS( I am assuming) to ask if you could hold Bitcoin with the same tax rules as your Roth IRA / IRA? Afterall you can prove that you hold them in a specific address and if you go through with such an agreement it would be easy for the IRS to fine you the penalty for early withdrawal and so on. As long as you sign such an agreement with your hodling stash address. but of course this won´t happen soon.
But it would be relatively easy to implement I imagine, holding coins on retirement tax rules without centralization. It is already integrated into the code.

I think they actually believe their justification to be honest. But I also believe it to be invalid in around two months. I guess what they really have trouble with is the extreme derivatives in unregulated exchanges, which the PBOC has outlawed (Great move towards what SEC could accept). So I think it is honest from their perspective, as in they did not really research it thoroughly and was influenced heavily by the opinions of other regulators at the time of the decision.

@_date: 2016-03-30 15:13:45
This is somewhat true. But the true value of bitcoin is in the transaction cost. If it is too high bitcoin is not so valuable, but blocks might produce more bitcoin per block. If it is too low bitcoin blocks might be too big, and the network inefficient. Which also makes it less valuable. 
The key is to have a price which is very competitive to the traditional fiat system. Whilst still making room for many users. This means that than off-chain solution might decrease the total BTC mineable in every block. But increase the same BTC's buying power significantly more to account for it.
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:42:45

When in a discussion you should always argue with the substance of your opponent not anything else. What I stated is that it would beneficial for bitcoin to have no limit blocks and segwit at the same time. On the condition that nodes get paid for propagation and storage of blockchain data, in such a way that the nodes can choose how much space they provide. In this way partial blockchain data is also rewarded. I guess you haven't seen the platforms based on the bitcoin blockchain that provide this type of data exchange in a decentralized manner for all data? Of course the technical hurdles and now also "political" are humongous. And such a move I at least do not believe in unless there is a satisfying solution to the problem. But I do believe this community will make it possible for the whole population to transact with one coin world wide with decentralization as its ultimate safeguard. That statement will survive the test of time!

Even technical analysis shows that 590 was at the top of the trend corridor(which is heavily increasing). So I guess the price will either drop or go a little lower in the short term. Since no one else would be a crystal ball for you.

It is still consistent. It is okay for the states to have more power as they would compete against each other on having the best policy. This increases democracy by decentralizing power. It is okay to have schools decide more of the curriculum so that we may discover new and more prominent ways of teaching. It is okay to let businesses discriminate so as to ensure they will be challenged by their communities. Potentially making them change their minds, worst case scenario bankruptcy.

Overtime I can only assume that dumping the value of the USD (aka. starting a currency war) will be crucial part of what drumpf wants to achieve with the US economy. This will likely cause bitcoin to spike upwards in my view.

Only difference is that the bitcoin price has sustained its daily gain while gold have not.

block times shorter than 10 minutes means that production of coins would exceed 1800. The blockhalf counter site only takes a limited set of data into account though.

Not really. Mobile data and fiber optics are inherently different economically. One makes money the other don't. Mobile data is usually built on the assumption that the investors can make around 4% interest on the capital employed in the towers and such. While fiber optic cables last much longer and are much less prone to technological advancement, these cables will make a much higher yield. In the example of mobile data most telecom companies don't even make enough to report a profit. But regular ISPs focusing on the most profitable strategy (fiber) makes money. And therefore it those not make sense to challenge the status quo of paying for a set speed. Which is what most consumers prefer. Unless the ISP already has enough political power to manipulate the political risks that come with away from the normal pay structure. And in the US it seems they do. But if the political system is not fucked there is absolutely no problem.

It doesn't really matter what you use for money. As people have to be willing to exchange whatever is used for money for goods anyway. The inflation in supply or lack thereof will not change most people's preference when it comes to how and how much they spend.

Banks really suck at currency conversion. My bank charges around 5%, without fees of course but offering a lower exchange rate. I think the reason is that the fractional reserve system makes it stupid risky for banks to have reasonable rates. Since they can't control the volume and sudden high volume customers could bankrupt a bank. Because of the extreme leverage they operate under.

Bitcoin payments are push based because of its nature. Not pull based, like credit cards and paypal. You can't tell your bitcoin client to send a transaction in the future(If you want the ability to cancel a subscriptions it is not possible.) without signing a transaction first. Which is effectively giving away money in advance.
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:16:23
Well that depends if the one you are buying from are converting. Which would require them to hedge hence increasing the buy. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:44:18
of course BU is not okay in its current iteration. But heoretically increasing the block limit if the community wants it is a okay solution. Not like BU but Bitcoin with a different hard coded block limit. But as user cosmosisq pointed out, it has the major drawback of exponential growth of segregated witness data.

This is a solid argument right here. The scaling issue should be made with additions that work with what is currently in deployment, like a second layer which doesn´t affect bitcoin, but can function in and of itself as well (meaning on any chain.)

No its not. But it is a successful way to predict price direction based on the technical picture. Yesterday for example XBT did not break the trend line(It was close). Which indicates that the long term bullish signal is clear. If the trend is not broken it predicts a new all time high in 2016.

You don't need to break up any banks if you just make it very clear that there will be no bailouts. The mere existence of bailouts as a concept makes the competition easier for larger banks. In a world without those, yes sure there would be significant hardships in the time after, but as banks would have gotten larger after this point they would more likely decrease their most risky investments. So that you would get a "normal" small-cap premium as observed pre 2008.

I guess you view Bitcoin as a collective entity in regard to the question.
What Bitcoin gets is increased security. But it is not Bitcoin that chooses to invest energy or even marginal energy into security. That is the decision of individual Miners who base their decision on basically how easily they may attain a kilowatt hour and it's worth in bitcoin, perhaps also their perception of reinvestment rate. They take up all the risk and provide all the capital to increase bitcoins security. For this marginal increase in security the Bitcoin protocol nor the holders of bitcoin provide anything, nothing at all.
So you may say that the marginal return from Bitcoins PoW mining protocol is unknown but always positive.

Yes this is a technical analysis made to predict on that timeframe as it looks like from the chart. But technical analysis has not shown to be very good a predictor of the future.

This title in and of itself is clearly problematic. For something to be potentially unlawful, makes a better case for the laws being inadequate or outright wrong rather than the act in question to be wrong. Therefore such unlawful acts would easily be seen as lawful under the concept of natural law, in laymans terms most people wouldn't care or incur any damage from such acts. "potentially unlawful" as a concept is a sign that regulation and government intervention has failed horribly at the topic in question.

Here is an argument: «fractional reserve banking is Evil» most of the advantages are flexibility in financing. This is most important for government entities who don't have any money. Therefore the most prestigious projects must be funded by creation of money. And then paid of (deleted) incrementally over time. This holds two functions. 1. Politicians can take credit for immense projects which people love. Consequently keeping them in power.
2. As this process goes on you get inflation. Which makes life harder for the layman. The inflation also helps raise more tax revenue in a sense. Since tax revenue as a percentage of the economy (in the US) is more or less constant. Using this system to create inflation at will helps increase the economic power of policy makers and other economic entities.
One should think long and hard about the morality of this.

Have you heard of the S-trend theory, and the theory decreasing marginal returns. Of which both apply to bitcoin. 
There is two wrongs with your predictions:
1. It must account for a rapid phase of super majority adoption, ending with a plateau. (obviously connected to price)
2. Marginal returns decrease with size. Meaning the growth rate you have plotted is too high, as this will greatly decrease over time until it matches that of global risk free real rate of return. (preferably as that means we have basically taken over, which your price predictions implicitly assume anyway.)

Your point about education is absolutely true. And yes my comment can come across as disingenuous because it mostly focuses on power dynamics. That being said financing is not evil at all. This is not what I am arguing. We need financing in a full reserve system too or else almost all social mobility is lost. I think most people can understand that. But home loans on a full reserve system does not cause housing bubbles the way you observe today. Normally rent would equal the cost of capital equivalent to the market value of a home. But when the norm is for people to borrow vast amounts of money into existence to own a home this skews the housing market a lot. The only way to opt out is to rent and own bank stocks. But even then you will be subject to the financing risk of the housing market. This is just another point why this type of system is so bad. It enriches those fortunate enough to own a home when interest is dropping. But traps people in debt when interest is going up, if home owners take out extra loans when times are good it mostly goes bad for them. Even faster too as that new money stimulates the economy further making it easier to justify interest hikes.

I am an econ BBA undergrad. And I had this exact same theory before I started my studies two years ago. (back in 2011) I think the theory is legit when hashrate is somewhat distributed (indicating no type of chip, or miner has any advantage.) say no one holds more than about 7%. Since if one actor holds a clear advantage in mining hardware they could in theory gamble on "mining out" their competition and hope for slightly lower prices.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:15:47
If you look at the oil crisis in 2015. Production only increased around 2% while demand was neutral. More space can make for a great decrease in price

It is the same thing as a ledger user moving coins to a more open system though. When you open the VM disk (AKA. access it) you are still compromised if the host is as well. Offline signing of transactions is the only way. We have been given this possibility. I think we all should make use of them.

Well amex does produce value. Mostly because its customers are in many ways forced to use fiat for its transactions. As we know the standard issue of fiat is paper, which is highly troublesome to pay with. Therefore an amex card makes value, for a profit. But since people are more or less forced into this system you could argue that this profit is made not from seeking it. but from rent-seeking. Which I as well as many others find highly unethical.

If this experiment works out like we want it. Then I think you can't get a transaction through without paying a "fair" fee. even if we scale transaction output. there has to be enough to scale to a critical mass number of transactions anyway. And there has to be miners getting paid and growing hashrate. whilst also being decentralized "enough" in their power over the network.

He is also fine with bitcoin having value. He is just saying he cant value it. As it has no intrinsic value. The same as with any other currency really.

If you invested that one dollar in the standard and poor's 500 index you would get a 62855% total return assuming you re-invest dividends. That is after inflation. I made this calculation just because it was fun :P
EDIT: starting in 1913 January and taking it out 2013 december. The calculation is as follows. 1*1.09899^100 and diveded by 20 to adjust for inflation. So then you get the 1913 value of the 100 year long investment.

No this is the thing you will lock up funds first and take fees for transactions that pass through your node (ie. changing the balance of your channels). But it won't make sense to charge for setting up a channel as a LN node. First of you can always back out, secondly you can have only incoming channels which is good for your node to just accept free of charge. And thirdly you would have to pay miners for opening and closing a channel if it has changed in balance.
So no you won't charge for channels, but you will consider whom you open channels with, as those channels would entail that you lock up funds. And if you don't consider this profitable for your goals or your node operation you should not, and can therefore forego doing so. But what you will do is charge for passing transactions.

Well in my country they continuously change the laws to fit the people's agreement. The current situation that might require a law or change of law is weekly thoroughly discussed by all parties that the change of law may concern on national television, so for everyone to see. This type of democratic society really gives the people the power to limit government if it is fitting to the current state of things. But the problem arise when things that threaten the democracy like war or a state of emergency of some kind. In that case the people become powerless and the government has the last say in all issues. The thing is that most people consider this to be necessary exception laws. This is truly a problem I believe.

It is not needed. Even any block size increase was per definition needed. But one could imagine it would make the growth of bitcoin stagnate and fee levels stabilize at level the market would find acceptable.
So neither is needed. But you could easily imagine that Bitcoin will benefit over time from competition. Although unlikely it might turn out that the BCash experiment could benefit bitcoin.

Yes, a state or government can write laws about anything they want. But if overstepped they only look like idiots. Blockchain can't be regulated in practice it is just computer code.
An example of failed regulation/laws would be the fact that weed is illegal in Jamaica. But it is not enforced.
At the end of the day any regulation is just a piece of paper. It all depends on the power of the government who wrote it.

You still have to catalog all the nodes you were previously connected to. I don't think it should be on by default, as Lightning could have a high turnover of nodes coming and going.
It would be better in my opinion to make behind the scene consensus on what a good watchtower is. (kind of like how consensus rules work on the bitcoin network.) Say for example someone makes watchtower software, but adds an incentive (the node operator can choose an amount to charge nodes it guards) but for the node to get the reward, it must announce what transactions it is guarding. If other nodes detect that things went wrong while be guarded, they announce it along with proof. As a result the bad watchtower is rated badly, and loses its reward for that transaction.
I think such a system could make watchtowers "almost" trustless.
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:10:40
But don't you understand that this notion that credit is not available is due to the fact that price of money is regulated? Let's imagine the market for credit set the true cost of debt at any given time, for a risk-free asset. Without any central bank interference. Then it will not matter if someone prefers to hoard money itself instead of employing it and making it available to people who can offer a greater return than a slight deflation rate (which becomes the floor for real rates. Acting like a reference rate.) Because the price will simply adjust and overtime the hoarded currency will not be reflected in the price of credit even.
Furthermore we will not get artificial asset bubbles and crashes as an argument to create more currency. Because the price of money cannot be regulated in this type of system. Only business law should apply. And seems obvious even to someone who haven't studied economics like we have ( I assume you have, you seem very competent.) that this artificial cycles of boom and busts is unsustainable over time. As the central planners responsible for setting the price of money continuously fail, despite almost a perfected method to set the correct price.

To some degree it seems so at the time. The market is mainly falling due to risk off. Probably triggered by the threat of rising interest rates.

Checks out. Even when the reward goes to 1 sat. But this also implies a third law. As for the second one to be true. The third law must state, the value of bitcoin is ever increasing. Since Bitcoin is a symbol of value, and work is valuable. So for more and more work to be directed at becoming 1. more efficient at hashing and 2. more units to hash. (the fact that makes 2. true) There has to be ever increasing value in bitcoin (aggregate demand is always up as far as you can buy/sell futures)

Contrary to popular belief, there wouldn't be deflation in the sense we have inflation now. Historically gold standard economies have had periods of 0,5% deflation per year for sometime, but followed by shorter periods of around 0,8% - 1% inflation. Long-term a steady money supply simply gives a stable currency value. But you lose the flexibility gained by a fractional-reserve banking system. And also there are generally less economic crisis (think boom bust cycles). As a full reserve system don't allow for the building of financial imbalances in the same way. I am talking imbalances like extreme government debt and student debt.
EDIT: if you are interested in deflationary currency policy you should check out  (Austrian school of economics) as these are scholars who focus on such policies.

Deflation is not a bad thing. Family fortunes get lost all the time btw, especially when that someone who dies is the only one competent to run the family business. Or when that someone chooses not give their wealth to their family.
It will not increase the wealth gap. (does that matter, why if not jealousy?) Bitcoin as a system encourages saving. Saving makes capital available to the people who can provide better things or services more efficiently. And the deflation makes it possible for extra competent people to get access to the capital at no extra cost. (nominal rates can be zero if you have a steady deflation rate. People have shown willing before to fund people for their competences even though their plans are wildly unlikely. But because they are potentially life changing for mankind. Elon Musk is a perfect example of this.) 
All this does is provide opportunity for those smart and competent enough to seek them out. Of course not everyone are, and most who are only for a short while. But the result of their projects has showed over time to increase humans wealth and prosperity tremendously.

This is so true! If you combine this with the fact that bail-ins are the new norm and the saying "don't invest in something you don't understand ".

I don't know about your tax legislation. But in my country there is in some cases okay to claim a tax credit for "actual costs" and pay the full capital gains on your total gains as if they were acquired with 0$. that way you get to pay around what you would pay if all your costs to acquire were used as a buy price, and pay tax on only the profit.

I am a investor hoarding coins. And there is only one use for market cap in this market, and that is for filling in models.

Yes I am aware. But the fact that it is possible is not good.
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:45:01
Nope. That is an obvious risk with what has been proposed. I am talking about the risk of someone making a UASF to target specific entities holdings. To exclude such addresses to make them invalid by soft fork.

Well yes, but there is also the issue of trading fees. and also time used, if you are in the US it would make sense to count minimum wage to yourself as a cost, following my logic. But I am uncertain if this is legal and in accordance with US tax code (it is also a mess). 
I think you should make a decision whether or not to pay taxes. But in my view your small time trading operation can be viewed as a corporation. And in my country you could argue in a court of law that it should be taxed as such, and win the case. as we don't mandate corporations to register here. although not doing so means having no custommers and so on.
But if you want to pay taxes on it, I advice that you seek advice from a professional (probably several as your tax code is fucked)

Not offering this service. Offering a better service. A service where you hold your balance in BTC and convert only where necessary, or as user demands.

This guy just answered your question. if its the legal person "beneficiary" who pays the tax, then that legal person only has to change affiliation to a country where there is no such thing. If you use bitcoin as well it will be next to impossible to sue/investigate the matter.

This is legal in Norway the way I interpret the law. Any type or form of organization/entity is legal, and can be recognized as a legal entity. I believe a ICO company in my jurisdiction would be recognized as a unregistered LLC by default, and not able to register as a regular LLC requires the owners to be named. So legal in a official capacity, but still as an unofficial entity which would enjoy all legal benefits of being registered. (Which mostly consist of streamlined ways to pay different types of taxes)

We share that view point. But there are many ways to make such a trade without any risk. For example if you are selling coins, for one you don't need to have access to them on the spot. You can have someone else transfer them to a address of choice when you see the money. My point is that there are many ways to mitigate the risk of a "western shootout" in these transactions.

Thank you for doing that then.

If you could up the stakes you could probably fund your own ASIC manufacturer.
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:23:53
Bitpay would do the job.
@_date: 2013-08-09 22:13:59
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:53:26
That would probably be illegal.
@_date: 2013-10-17 00:50:03
Is the dollar on that list? Or is that suddenly backed?
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:23:34
You are predicting how things are technologically inn 100 years or so. The only problem is that medium of exchange at this point is meaningless.

If it were up to me Gavin should not be a face of Bitcoins dev team, he should go into hiding.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:21:46
Multiply difficulty by 10 and lower trading price by 20. As OP suggested was a good margin.

Thought I were the only one in here for this reason. I know I am not alone now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:26:46
Funny, it gives me a good feeling that they didn't make an effort to steal the money. I get the impression that they just wanted to stop the bank stealing from the people.

As a Norwegian I actually don't think that highly of my government at all. Just so that is stated.

Love this type of mentality. It is sad how most people don't realise the power of this kind of thinking.

Half the chance of getting it right with the traditional system
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:39:59
Good to see people with an understanding of how things work. Have to ask you this. Is it right that the wall street crash in the 20s happend right after the dollar wasn't pegged to gold anymore? And also do you see a connection between these events and the great depression?
EDIT: asking because I am young and don't have the perspective. But I have heard that history repeats itself.

People are biased in seriously fucked up ways. that is why they laugh. And it is also why you see that graph.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:27:45
Yes it does? If a business is to pay their workers in BTC it is ilogical to convert fiat income to BTC doing that. Much easier to accept BTC.

If you still have access to the hdd where the bitcoins were stored. You can try to recover it using recuva from piriform. This may work even if the drive is formatted. Didn't work for me tho.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:31:32
That actually might be the initial reason for starting the page if you ask me. The philosophy of a free economy is quite fun.
@_date: 2013-09-30 14:03:19
But I am only in 3 btc as of now. I only said this to inform of the current market. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:44:17
You can also choose to keep some of the coins. For example take what you earn in fees by using bitpay and save it as coin.
@_date: 2013-09-05 22:44:54
I have a feeling someone from the inside will warn us ...

The only way this can be done is to break the hashing protocol. Before we replace it that is. Almost impossible.

Doesn't matter as long as Spotify performs a location control before they give you the invoice.

I would say both statements are equally true. Also creating a paradox. I predict that chaos will seem favorable within the next 20 years.

What is the underlying reasons for the depression? (We don't learn this in my country.)

Economic shocks will always happen when toy have society that deals with "Money". There is no way to get around it. But it is less likely to happen with decentralized money, at least the staged ones (asuming it is widely accepted). But technological revolutions have always caused shocks throughout history. There is nothing to do about it.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:25:51
I would argue it is safest for both parties. You don't see what you don't expect.

How can you trust a computer you buy? Internet can be reached through your electrical wiering. Also it could contain a gprs chip not listed or connected to BIOS, but recording everything.

If you think it can someday become a widespread payment option, you should have bought your coins the second you heard about them. But you didn't...

Almost everything known by the majority as money, is per definition play money. Or currency if you like that better.
