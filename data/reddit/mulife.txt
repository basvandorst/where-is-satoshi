If Newsweek can track him down, for sure the government can too. Maybe his secrecy wasn't as good as he thought..

I too believe that this is actually Satoshi himself, he fits the bill, and is constantly avoiding the question if he wrote the code. If you see the video where he is coming out of his dorway, you can see he snickers after "I'm not involved in Bitcoin", which is pretty basic body language reading.
tl;dr: Old reclusive, eccentric computer nerd comes up with briliant idea, has the capability and connections to launch revolutionary idea. Realizes down the road the massive implications of his idea, and abandons project.

Yes, when he looks the interviewer in the eyes "I have nothing to do with (looks away) Bitcoin (looks back at interviewer)"
"Nothing do with developing (looks away) (stops short of saying Bitcoin)".
He KNOWS when it was supposed to be developed, yet he can't pronounce it. 
And he manages to say Bitcoin the first time, then Bitcom and Bitcoins.. 
EDIT: clarifications

I'm sure it will be back at $1200, and more, when it is actually worth that because the community have invented a killer use for it!

bitcoin.com is making CSW look like an honest cult leader

r BTC, aka Bitcoin Troll Community, bitcoin's own lunatic fringe. A bunch of trolls held hostage by their own idiotic ideas; no marketprice, no developers and relegated to an alt coin.

Actually I got some old seed words with tons of unclaimed airdrops, so it would be a small hassle to move to a new seed

Fortunately most of my friends are rather technical so they are able to install the wallet by themselves and send me their public address. 
If not, I take 5-10 minutes to walk them through it, explaining not to use a web wallet and why, and they usually are amazed at how fast they receive the coins. After that, they are usually educating themselves on price levels, adoption, mining, etc.

Maybe they are trying to sell off their coins?
