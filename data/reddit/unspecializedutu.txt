Statistics? Christmas lights are also used only once per year.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:42:02
I'm glad that there are still smart people around here. The "whataboutism" of these Bitcoin fanboys is absolutely unbelievable.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:42:58
It is an issue and none of these Bitcoin fanboys have a solution to it. They only refuse to see the issue because it benefits them financially. They've been brainwashed.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:28:13
Major corporations are already doing their part. 
Are you prepared for the same moves, Bitcoin? Or should I say, China?
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:47:07
Wrong. No one has debunked that a network that will constantly need an increasing amount of energy to maintain itself won't be a problem. Just tell me what justifies Bitcoin using more energy than countries out there? And how it won't be a problem once the energy consumption troubles, triples itself etc? You really do choose to stay ignorant here most likely because it benefits you somehow.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:52:02
Nah, you were disagreeing with me all along. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:53:09
Oh so you're playing that card. The energy requirement per user doesn't change, the amount of users only increase.
Oh I see, mr. Wise Guy. Nice one but once again, ignoring the problem completely.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:59:02
It indeed does and there's proof that it does.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:40:04
That is a different argument.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:49:59
But your Xbox's energy consumption won't double itself in a few months. I believe, otherwise it's probably broken.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:45:04
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:46:46
I can't believe how brainwashed you are. This is unbelievable. I just told you logically why the amount of transactions matters and you just dodged it, telling me that I need to read more about it.
How can one be that brainwashed is beyond my understanding. You also shared an article that treats bitcoin as an enviroment-friendly solution??? Unbelievable. Please wake up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:27:53
Propaganda. It is just for one month. If every Christmas person used their xmas lights 24/7 for 365 days a year, then yes it would indeed be a bigger problem for energy consumption than BTC mining for one year.
But BTC mining is not a Christmas event soooo... there goes that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:56:59
Doesn't change the fact that you praise it here. And apparently refuse to see the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:39:01
Exactly. This brainwashing is terrible.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:36:12
That is BTC propaganda article that they shove down your throat to keep you brainwashed. The article is talking about one month. If all the christmas people in the world used their xmas lights 24/7 for 365 days a year, then yes that would be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:20:55
Don't believe you but sure.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:39:01
I'm talking about the future. It's a problem because it will be a problem in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:54:21
Can you explain why maintaining BTC network in 2017 takes more electricity than maintaining it in 2011?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:53:18
Your argument would be valid if we ditched paper money. But we have both paper money and bitcoin. We don't need yet another problem, and whataboutism has never been a valid argument.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:49:00
There is. The world of Bitcoin uses more electricity in 2017 than it did in 2011. It's not even comparable!
Or are you saying Bitcoin used more energy than countries in 2011, or what is your point?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:43:05
Going into insults. That's all you've got. Nice.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:02:28
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:45:33
Yes, MSM. But Bitcoin fanboys treat it as "fake news" and don't care about it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:30:40
*The sheer amount of electricity that crypto-currencies use.*
That's enough read to understand that this "journalist" doesn't know what she's talking about. Whereas data centers require the same amount of energy to maintain, Bitcoin network's energy consumption constantly requires more. Right now it isn't the world-threatening problem but it will be. You know when value and transactions double, so does the required amount of energy to maintain the network?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:03:58
You intentionally refuse to see the problem here. Every person living in a rich western state uses certain amount of energy. A thing like Xbox belongs to this circle and when they're using Xbox, they're not using their coffee machines, PCs, etc.  Whereas when we have things like BTC mining that don't belong into this circle, they're obviously just adding more weight to the issue of energy consumption.
Hell, BTC is not even that popular globally (368k transactions per 24hrs) but you're still arguing that it uses less energy than
Xboxes. XBOSES??! Don't you see the problem with that? You really just choose to stay ignorant.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:00
Like I said, this is yet again whataboutism. You justify another problem's existence by pointing at another problem. That's like saying theft is right because there are worse criminals such as murderers.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:22:45
I understand that we need that power to secure the network but it's problematic because the network keeps getting bigger all the time. There is no end. But there is an end to earth resources that we use to secure that network. And I don't believe those resources are being spent very wisely.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:44:53
No, I choose to address the issue and not ignore the issue in order to benefit myself financially. Because I'm a better human being than that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:10:41
But electricity usage is the problem here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:30:57
Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than countries out there. Quite a lot for just "sufficiently securing the chain". And that is just for 360,000 transactions a day.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:39:39
Whataboutism. Every Bitcoin fanboy's favorite argument. I love it. Haha.
No, once again we don't need yet ANOTHER problem in this world.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:56:51
It does. If the same amount of energy that was used in 2011 to maintain the Bitcoin network would be used now and no more at all, the transactions would get stuck, completely flooded, and the network would be literally unusable. What part of that is wrong? Tell me, and stop just saying I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:18:26
It is. It doubled itself in 2 months! Wake the hell up. You've been brainwashed!
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:36:44
Each transaction is confirmed by the miner and that requires energy, so logically the increasing amount of transactions will require more energy. Compare 1000 1$ transactions vs. 1 1$ transaction.
You should also be aware that servers tend to hibernate quite a bit, meaning that they have lower CPU usage when all the power isn't needed for hosting. But when you're mining Bitcoin, your CPU usage is maxed because that energy is constantly needed. That is the problem here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:54
I think Bitcoin users are at least partly responsible, since their use of the network benefits the miners and this level of energy consumption.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:17:55
Whataboutism, every Bitcoin fanboy's favorite argumentation method.
Servers hibernate, BTC mining doesn't. There's the major difference. And despite the whataboutism, there is simply no justification for Bitcoin to consume more energy than countries out there.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:55:12
I just found out the propaganda article you are referring to, and it is indeed just for one month. If every Christmas person used their xmas lights 24/7 for 365 days a year, then yes it would indeed be a bigger problem for energy consumption than BTC mining for one year.
But BTC mining is not a Christmas event soooo... there goes that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:44:14
The problem is that it won't replace governments and legacy systems. Weird to even think that way because there is absolutely zero evidence of that ever happening.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:07:33
I have multiple accounts on this site.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:38:40
Doesn't change the fact that it uses more energy than countries out there just to sufficiently securing the chain, as this guy said here. Logically keeping BTC network up in 2011 was much easier than keeping it up in 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:00:19
This is an old one but relevant. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:32:52
I definitely agree. Bitcoin is an interesting concept but it's also dangerous in many ways, and irresponsible if we won't put a stop for it once we'll be required.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:52:45
I see none. In fact, this subreddit SUPPORTS mining: 
*If you have a fairly powerful computer that is almost always online, you can help the network by running Bitcoin Core.* **TOTALLY BIASED!**
The top posts are mostly just praising Bitcoin and not paying attention to all the issues that the future will face due to its existence. If you address the issue you'll get downvoted and my post isn't the first one I've seen that happen to.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:56:24
It uses more electricity than El Salvador but not more than Denmark or Ireland? So  seems like it doesn't use more power than BTC mining then... Huh.
Thanks for confirming that I'm right. Once again.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:58:59
Power was definitely invented 10000 years ago. Hmm.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:55:06
You praise the system that consumes more energy than countries out there. That is a fact, and you don't have to be professor to find that out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:29:39
There is no "coordinated attack". There are only mentally healthy people, and then there are delusional conspiracy theorists just like you.
