I wouldn't mind sharing if it was actually performing in practice, but since it was only trading in their sandbox and not through the real platform I'm not ready to share it just yet. Mostly because at this point it buys in correct but misses the sell mark and then you're just at a lose because it's trying to place limits and misses the mark by a cent.. One day it'll get there, but it really only performs so well on something like btc with volatility.

Yes!! Completely agree, hopefully they discontinue USD well, that currency is used far to often for such nefarious practices!!

I think he's simply pointing out that moving purchased bitcoins from gdax is free (they pay the transaction fee which you pointed out is hefty)

Running it on a pi with a $25 500gb usb isn’t a problem

Yes, but you need to take that with the biggest grain of salt you’ve seen. That was only based on market orders for buying and selling on GDAX which comes with additional .25% fees per trade which could have very well brought the return to negatives. I changed the algorithm to only trade limits which has no fee but is much harder to “guarantee” that the trade goes through. Furthermore I keep pulling errors from their api which is likely due to the amount of calls I make (to ensure I’ve got the best limit order pricing to optimize my chances of filling the order post only)
So, with that taken in to account it’s possible, due to the volatility of btc, that you could get a 1% return daily even on negative days for btc which I was able to get for a week (where I was getting 5%-7% daily given optimal conditions of trading even when btc was -5% to -7% on those days.
I haven’t had time to fine tune my algorithm, and I can’t bank on it yet so I can only work on it sparingly which will likely mean I won’t manage to complete it, but learning through it is enough benefit for now - especially because the lessons learned aren’t nearly as much of a gamble as he potential loses, it only takes one bad day to wipe out your earnings, especially when you don’t realize them.

Show me the Cher facts

Is this a recent modification on their end? Within the past week?

It only took me 4 hours w/ 200mbps

That explains a lot.. I've been running a simple trading bot which generally returns of 5% daily and since their BCash stunt it's been 100% negative by 5-10% - if they're reporting inaccurate data through the api then that would explain the shift between + and - returns to only - returns for a solid two weeks..
