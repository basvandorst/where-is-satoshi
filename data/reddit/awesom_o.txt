Storing your coins online will most likely be more convenient and easier to access, however there is a lot of risk in doing so. Because Bitcoins are not federally regulated and MTGOX has no obligation to repay lost coins, in the case of someone hacking into their network, you may very well lose all your stored coins. It's really not a safe way to store coins. It's probably acceptable for small amounts that would not have a serious affect on yours savings, but for larger amounts you should probably take more precaution. 
Here's a wiki on how to better store your coins:

Bitcoins as an investment is very risky, and I don't think anyone giving financial advice would tell someone to invest in it without extreme caution. While the gains could be astronomical there is also a high probability of a devastating loss. Hopefully in the future Bitcoins will continue to gain more interest and the value will once again appreciate.

There was post just a couple days ago that said they gave out personal information, and it's in their terms apparently, which is good enough reason for me not to want to use them.

I'm in the same boat but am currently waiting for an authentication from Coinbase. The reason you can't pay for bitcoins withs PayPal or Credit Cards is because PayPal and the credit card companies do not allow purchases of Bitcoins. In that case, the seller can be stripped of the payment, and lose the Bitcoins.
