I hate to tell you this, but you just wrote an essay that supports my statement entirely. 


This is the same inquiry. The CFTC has jurisdiction over future contracts. Whether a contract is considered a "future" depends on a number of factors, most notably whether the contract was purely speculatory, which is most strongly indicated by whether or not the parties had the capacity and intent to take actual delivery of the underlying commodity. See, e.g., *CFTC v. Co. Petro Mktg. Group, Inc.*, 680 F.2d 573. The statute cited in the Order (which you yourself even quoted!) creates carve-outs for situations where intent to deliver is clearly shown:


In both of those situations, there is a definite intent to deliver, either because the underlying was, in fact, delivered, or because there is a binding obligation to do so. Consequently, the Order discusses at great length whether intent to deliver is present in this case, and in fact uses this as the primary justification for its ruling:






**TL;DR**: No intent to deliver = futures contract = Bitfinex needed to follow the rules and didn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 17:20:08


Yeah, I'm not so sure you do, because you literally said that monetary base inflation was "the rate your money is being debased at when it sits in a bank account." That's not just a mischaracterization, it's fundamentally wrong on a number of very basic levels. 


And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon. I know it's been some time since Econ 101, but ceteris paribus never actually happens IRL. If increasing the money supply led directly to inflation, one would think we'd have seen massive inflationary effects from the $4.5 trillion pumped into the system via QE, and yet, here we are at &lt; 2%. (Oh wait, I forgot, you think the books are cooked, so disregard this). 


You're right, I would consider a Doctor who ignores 30 years of advancements in his field and empirical evidence to be a "laughable joke."  Especially when that Doctor isn't actually a Doctor, and substantially all of the other Doctors think the first Doctor is a loony. 


Whereas Shadowstats is basically providing a charitable service.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:38:23


This is just defining a "future". If there is intent to deliver the underlying it's considered a forward and falls outside of CFTC jurisdiction. The problem for Bitfinex is that they never intended to deliver the underlying, which means they were improperly trading in futures contracts without registering as an FCM with the CFTC.

The economy is *not* terrible. It's not *fantastic*, but compared to the global economy as a whole, we're doing alright. Unemployment is at historical lows (inb4 but muh U6! hint: nobody cares), we've seen 75 months of consecutive job growth (inb4 but muh LFPR! hint: *really*, nobody cares), GDP is growing (slowly, but growing nonetheless) and wage pressure is finally starting to build. Things could be better, no doubt, but the sky-is-falling hyperbole frequently bandied about this sub is frustrating to read. 


We didn't get *lucky.* We analyzed the situation and took action based on our knowledge at the time, and it turned out to be the right call. Since then, there have been a number of structural and regulatory changes, most notably Dodd-Frank, to prevent a similar crisis from occurring. It might not be perfect, but it's enough to ensure we don't experience another liquidity crisis like we did in '08. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 16:07:55


I did not say it was funded by the government, I said it is *backed* by the government, which it is. 


Which is why it's backed by the government. Keeping 100% of funds on hand at all times would be a criminally inefficient use of that money. And unless you're expecting 100% of consumer banks to fail simultaneously, wholly unnecessary.


After 2008, its safe to say that a bail out would be pretty unpopular. 
There's a gaping chasm of differences between the hypothetical in question and the 2008 crisis. In 2008, the government bailed out banks to prevent a systemic collapse of credit markets. Fulfilling a public obligation to cover depositor funds in the event of bank failure isn't in the same ballpark, shit, it's not even the same sport. And I'm baffled as to why you think the government directly reimbursing millions of Americans would be politically unpopular, but I am truly excited to hear it.

Congress gave the CFTC rulemaking authority to determine the definition of a commodity, so effectively, yes, Congress did. Separately, I find it amusing that you would trust Congress with this stuff over an agency full of experts with decades of relevant experience. 


Again I ask, *who the fuck cares.* This is a matter of Federal jurisdiction. Florida law is completely irrelevant. Moreover, just because something is a *currency* (I highly doubt they used the term "money") doesn't mean it can't also be a commodity and within the purview of the CFTC (see, e.g., currency swaps). 


Even you must recognize how ridiculously stupid this argument is.

No, it actually is quite hard and cumbersome (for average joes), but that's not even the point. Security is a problem with fiat too, which gets stolen and scammed all the time. The difference comes down to one of recourse: consumers don't *have* to think about security, because banks, insurance and/or government will always protect them from loss. This is why "be your own bank" was never going to be a selling point of bitcoin - very few people *want* to be their own bank, and even fewer are actually prepared to do so.

Yes, true, but that's not happening here. 100% of people who understand what "market cap" means know that it doesn't apply to bitcoin, because bitcoin isn't a company and doesn't have stock.

Of course those terms sound much less fancy, but they do provide the benefit of being correct.

This post is through and through. 


QE isn't "printing" money, it's increasing the Fed's balance sheet through an asset swap. That's completely different than what occurred to Zimbabwe, which devalued its dollar *four times in three years.* The proof is in the pudding - do you see the USD hyperinflating? 


Are you seriously suggesting that the U.S. intervened in Libya because of that reason? We've moved from to territory. 


That's now how this works. [That's now how any of this works.]( 
First of all, if increasing the monetary base caused significant devaluation of the dollar, we should be more worried about the $4.5 trillion the Fed pumped into the economy instead of the ~$2-3 trillion collectively held by China and Russia (it doesn't though, because as noted above, it hasn't). 
That concern is irrelevant, however, as neither country would ever *dream* of dumping their USD reserves because it would be economic suicide to do so. Russia needs every last foreign dollar it can get its hands on so long as the Ruble stays in the shitter, and China's more vulnerable to an exchange war by an order of *magnitude* (don't forget, we own almost as much of their debt as they do ours).
But let's pretend you're right, and the dollar sees some modest inflation. *So what?* Frankly, after two deflationary quarters in a row, the Fed would probably *welcome* some inflation right now. Why on Earth would that result in "economic collapse"?

All of the following are TRUE SOLUTIONS to every single one of your issues


There's your first problem.  Who carries *zero* cash as a matter of course? At least bring a $20 with you for emergencies.


If only every major bank let you freely transfer money to other people. Or if there were a half dozen money-transfer apps like Venmo which do the same thing.


I would love to see this incredibly intimate form that took you 20 minutes to fill out. Link?


And how did you come to this conclusion?


Again, Venmo. 


I don't know where this trope comes from that wire transfers take weeks. Its completely false. International transfers take 3-5 business days, tops. Domestic usually clear same day. 
(That said, I do recognize international transfers as a promising use-case for bitcoins, but let's not mischaracterize the competition)

That isn't an argument, it's an opinion. 


Flatly false. The recession has been over since 2009. And the financial crisis wasn't even close to the longest, that honor goes to the Panic of 1873 (aptly titled the "Long Depression"), back when we were still on a "sound money" standard for which you advocate so fervently. 


Yeah, you might have a point, except for that whole Great Depression thing, which occurred largely due to the Fed's rigid adherence to the exact policy you're endorsing. In fact, many economists believe that if the U.S. had abandoned the gold standard earlier, as Britain did in 1931, we could have seen a faster recovery and potentially avoided the double-dip recession of 1937 altogether. There's a wealth of empirical evidence showing that countries which abandoned the gold standard sooner, such as GB and Sweden, recovered from the Depression more rapidly than countries which remained on it longer, like the U.S. and France. Here's [an interesting NBER study]( which discusses that point in greater detail if you're curious. 


Name one economy that runs on "sound money" today. Think about that.


Understatement of the century. And theoretical capability doesn't mean shit if it can't produce those results IRL. Even if it could, it would need to scale by a factor of 1000 to compete with Visa alone. It's flatly improbable, and frankly utterly naive, to imagine that the world could ever run on the blockchain.


I agree with this, and I've said elsewhere that Bitcoin would do well to position itself as an instrument primarily designed for cross-border payments. 


What a meaningless comment. You could say that about literally (yes, *literally*) anything. Replace "monetary system" with "bitcoin" or "the Earth."

One of the counts he was convicted for included continuing a criminal enterprise, which considers whether the Defendant killed or caused another to be killed in furtherance of that enterprise.

It's literally routine procedure.

The problem with people like *you* is that you disagree with the law itself, so you think that convicting someone on its basis is inherently wrong. The law doesn't work like that, kiddo.

Thanks for the link. After doing some research, I'm still not convinced their USD accounts are FDIC insured. Coinbase's TOS are pretty vague, stating only that:


This rather deliberate choice of language seems to indicate that USD Wallets are protected by the FDIC in the event of the insured *bank's* failure, not Coinbase's failure. In order for the FDIC to cover Coinbase as well, they would have to be eligible for something called "pass-through insurance." Pass through insurance would only apply in this instance if Coinbase was a custodian or fiduciary of their customers' clearly segregated USD funds. 
Not only are the Coinbase TOS silent on the issue of segregation, they conflictingly claim to be a custodian in Section 5.1 but then disclaim in Section 6.1.6 that "Coinbase may not be a qualified custodian under applicable law." Does this mean Coinbase expects every customer to do research on the applicable law in their jurisdiction regarding fiduciary relationships? I sincerely doubt anyone has. 
Moreover, in addition to not being a member of the FDIC, it's rather telling that Coinbase doesn't advertise its accounts as being FDIC insured anywhere outside of that brief reference in the user agreement. This is rather unusual for a bank, which usually proudly advertises its FDIC insurance. See for yourself - if you google "[large bank] FDIC" it will immediately take you to a prominent webpage which certifies that bank's FDIC membership and the associated benefits one receives by banking at an FDIC insured institution. Coinbase doesn't do this, and that's pretty suspicious, since there's no reason to withhold that information. 
I know the Coinbase team reads these forums - can anyone confirm or deny the status of FDIC insurance on their USD wallets?
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:46:25


They were investment *banks,* though you can feel free to call them firms if you'd like. The point is that GSA wouldn't have prevented any of the activities which led to their failure, and their failures were a major catalyst behind the financial crisis, so it's obviously incorrect to claim that the repeal of GSA was a proximate cause underlying the financial crisis.


This is oversimplified to the point of being incorrect. Obviously money was owed to *someone,* but the financial crisis was borne of *illiquidity,* not insolvency (ever wonder why it's called the *financial* crisis?). The proximate cause behind Lehman's failure, for instance, was largely due to the unexpected collapse of the tri-party repo market. Were they over-exposed and under-collateralized? Sure. But you could say the same thing about *every* investment bank leading up to 2006. Hell, there's a genuine argument to be made that if the FSA hadn't nixed the Barclays deal Lehman might still be alive and kicking today. 


I don't understand what you're trying to say here. Are you referring to credit *default* swaps? The GSA had absolutely nothing to do with them, given as they weren't invented until about 60 years after the bill was passed. 


This is just completely unsupported. Find me the provision of the GSA which prevented an investor from purchasing CDOs (which also didn't exist at the time the GSA was passed).

Woah there! You move those goalposts any farther away and I won't be able to see them anymore. 


So in addition to moving the goalposts, you're also begging the question. Your argument is literally "we spend 1/3 of our life working for fiat, fiat is a scam which is a ~~lie~~ unfair deal, therefore we spend ~~our entire~~ 1/3 of our life working for a ~~lie~~ unfair deal." You're proving nothing beyond your inability to form a coherent argument.

Not true at all. This is a common misconception, but Glass-Steagall actually had very little to do with the financial crisis. It certainly wouldn't have prevented it by any means, as the activities which caused the initial big bank failures - Lehman, Bear, and Merrill - would have occurred regardless of GSA. Moreover, by the time GLB repealed the law in 1999, courts had already carved out a broad series of loopholes which allowed banks to engage in almost all of the activities previously prohibited by the GSA. (See, e.g., *Bd. of Gov. of Fed. Res. Sys. v. Invest. Co. Inst.*, 450 U.S. 46 (1981)).
The original catalyst behind the subprime mortgage boom occurred way back in the late 1980s, after the S&amp;L crisis prompted the RTC to contract with the private sector to help unwind some ~$400 billion in illiquid portfolios. The only way to do this was to expand the range of mortgages which qualified for GSE backing, which when combined with the veneer of government approval afforded under the CRA and Title XIII of HCDA, caused subprime and "special affordable" loans to increase to their highest levels in recorded history. Importantly, this increase began in the mid 1990s, long before the GSA was repealed, and continued to increase until the mid 2000s - yet, the *proportion* funded by commercial banks stayed relatively consistent at around 30%, right up until the bubble burst. Its fairly clear that consolidation between commercial and investment banks played a very minor role in the financial crisis, and GLB gets unfairly maligned while GSA is undeservedly praised.

Yeah none of that has anything to do with the financial crisis. LFPR has been declining for decades, long before the financial crisis hit, and is largely due to globalization and an aging populace. Wages have stagnated in part for similar reasons. Holding interest rates at zero is a conscious policy choice by the Fed, not a symptom, and bonds are hot right now so I'm not sure what you're getting at with that. As far as bubbles go, like I said earlier, if you want to claim Keynesian policies have exacerbated the boom and bust cycle, go ahead and write your nobel-prize winning paper since it's apparently obvious to you.

Pretty much every major U.S. bank (WF has SurePay, Chase has QuickPay, etc.) allows for free money transfer between individuals with nothing more than an e-mail address or phone number. 


Come on dude, first rule of business is to know your competition! Venmo is a popular money transfer app that works just like Google Wallet, Square Cash, etc. It's designed to fix the exact problem you've complained of: reimbursing friends for pizza or cab fare without the hassle of making change for everyone. It's free and extremely simple, you should give it a shot. 


Uh... if you don't know what Venmo is, how do you know nobody at the party knew what it was?


Because that's totally going to win people over- talking about "muh protocols." Most people don't give a shit about protocols. They want something simple and easy, and Bitcoin is currently neither.

Second, I really enjoy how you only challenged the second link, when the first and third links (respectively) cited studies showing that Americans blamed the GOP in incredible 22 point and 25 point margins. And those were just the first three I picked after googling "who do Americans blame for the shutdown" - there are plenty more if you'd care to look (and FYI, I didn't find a single [credible] poll suggesting that the Public believes anyone but the GOP is to blame for the shutdown).

The dollar represents the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which is funded by the U.S. Economy.  Think about it this way: pretend the U.S. Economy is a giant corporation (let's call it X Corp), and the U.S. Government is their Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors isn't producing much in and of itself, but it facilitates the production of whatever X Corp makes.  So when X Corp's Board decides to issue stock, the value of that stock is determined by what the market thinks that particular piece of X Corp is worth.  If X Corp decides to issue more stock, *ceteris paribus,* the value of any one individual stock goes down.  *However,* if X Corp has had a great year and is producing twice as many goods and services as it did last year, *theoretically,* X Corp's stock should be unaffected because each individual stock represents the same amount of goods and services.
Let's bring that analogy back to the government.  The reason why the Fed can issue trillions of dollars without serious inflationary concerns is for the same reason X Corp can issue more stocks without losing value: the U.S. Government is growing almost as fast as money is being printed, so each individual dollar is worth roughly the same.  (Some inflation (around ~2-4%) is desirable, but that's another topic for another day).  
Now let's look at Bitcoin. Just like the USD or a share of X Corp., Bitcoin's value is determined by how much others are willing to pay for it.  But unlike the Govt. or X Corp., which are valued in part based on the goods and services they produce, Bitcoin does not produce goods or services. Its value is not based on any intrinsic quality or economic benefit (beyond the very marginal* benefit of its utility as a currency).  That's why Bitcoin is so volatile. There's no underlying value, so the market is essentially responding exclusively to itself like a perpetual echo chamber.

That is not deflation. That is interest you pay in exchange for the increased utility you get from increased leverage, liquidity, and the present-time value of money. Credit cards encourage spending, whereas deflation discourages it. Deflation also depresses investment by encouraging saving.

Bro, you just described the beginnings of a deflationary spiral.


This is an incredibly problematic assumption - I would argue that there is a massive amount of evidence to suggest sticky prices and imperfect markets limited by bounded rationality. But that's another discussion.


So now we're existing in a hypothetical economy where population is stagnant and money growth = 0? Holy assumptions, batman! But ok, let's roll with it.
Here's the problem with your theory. If everyone is using "sound" money that doesn't inflate, and everyone is constantly producing goods and services (like chairs), the price of that chair should fall, yes? And if it falls, you just have to start making more chairs to compensate, resulting in an even greater fall in price, right? 
So if *everybody* starts doing that, and the price of [everything starts falling,]( why would a rational consumer (who is apparently living in an economy with prices that immediately adjust to reflect all information in the market) not simply hoard their money and stop buying anything altogether, since they know that (1) their money will be worth a lot more next week, and (2) the goods they buy will rapidly depreciate in price?
Do you see the problem here?

So let me get this straight. In your ideal economy, most people wouldn't own homes (despite the numerous benefits of ownership over renting), most people wouldn't own cars (because apparently the size of the U.S. and its relatively sparse population is irrelevant in our lack of public transportation), and economic growth is apparently "cancer" when it's "fake" growth and not based on "actual growth and assets" (whatever the hell that means).

Quoting so you don't delete after I point out that, first of all, New York City's GDP is roughly [five times as large]( as Singapore's.
Second, the economic center of the world is and will continue to be New York for foreseeable future. It's simply indisputable. Just look at the numbers:
- The SGX is relatively tiny, with a mere 774 listings and a market cap of roughly 525 billion. 
- The SEHK is bigger, with about 1400 listings and a market cap of about $2 trillion USD. 
- Pretending that either holds a candle to the NYSE - with almost 1900 listings and a current market cap of roughly [$16.6 *trillion-*]( is just wrong or stupid.


This is my favorite part - where you demonstrate the extent of your utterly misguided view of the global economy. Acting like Bitcoin's tiny $8 billion market cap will have *any* measurable effect is simply laughable (I lol'd). Seriously man, get a grip on yourself and tone down the "new world order" hyperbole.

... you're not wrong about any of this.


You are wrong about this. And I feel like you have been misinformed, and I want to correct your misconceptions. When the money supply stays stable but the economy expands, you get deflation. When a currency deflates, it causes all sorts of problems. It causes hoarding because consumers have a rational incentive not to spend (they know prices will continue to drop) which reduces money velocity and slows the economy, leading to a possible deflationary spiral. It hinders credit and becomes an effective increase in interest rates. Literally nobody thinks deflation is a desirable trait in a currency. 
So why inflation?  Because it's better than deflation, and inflation is the best way to counteract it. Simple as that.

Bro you need a lot more than a "bit of panic" to topple the world's most established and reliable currency. I mean, 3 month T-bills are considered "riskless" investments. And what, we're supposed to trust the unsourced opinion of one rando economist over the opinions of billions of investors worldwide who trust the full faith and credit of the USD?  


My bank (Wells Fargo) allows me to instantly send money for free to any other customer with a major bank account, and all I need is their name and phone number or email address.  Are you really trying to claim that Bitcoin is easier and simpler than that?  And in the rare event that I need to send a large sum of money internationally, it costs roughly $20 to send a wire transfer anywhere in the world.  Hardly a "steep" fee. 


It's honestly laughable to compare acceptance of Bitcoin to that of the USD, which functions as the reserve currency for the *entire world.*  Even if Bitcoin's adoption increases exponentially for the next ten years, it will still only be used a minuscule fraction as often as USD.  Come on, now, let's be realistic about what Bitcoin is and is not, and it is most definitely not a replacement for the dollar.


Ok but again, and I feel like a broken record here, *why would anyone use a deflationary currency.*  You and everyone else recognizes that Bitcoin's market cap draws ever closer, and if adoption and value continues to increase as you claim, what rational consumer would spend a Bitcoin if they know it will increase in value?  You can't have it both ways.  You can't call it a currency but treat it like a commodity.

*Oh Boy* I was hoping you'd say that. That clause is a restriction on what *individual states* can make legal tender. It is not a mandate that *only* gold and silver can be legal tender, because Art. I, Sec. 8 grants *Congress* the power to coin "Money," which is never defined. Therefore, in a world where *only* Congress, and not the states, coins money (i.e., the one we live in), that clause is entirely irrelevant. 
Moreover, there is a precedent for precious metals other than gold or silver to be used legitimately for coinage - see the Coinage Act of 1792, which legally allowed copper to be used for legal tender.

Unnecessary is a broad term. Its not necessary for us to invest in things like renewable energy or medicine, but I think everyone can agree they are desirable. Well, deflation doesn't discriminate. It will depress all spending, which is unequivocally bad for a modern economy. It also makes truly necessary purchases harder for the poor, who have less access to credit.

Don't put words in my mouth. First, I never said Bitcoin had to be one or the other; I simply stated that it doesn't look like a currency and isn't being used as one, so labeling it as a currency is inaccurate.  Call it a "Digiturrency" for all I care.
Secondly, I never said all currencies *must* be inflationary. But it's a fact that Bitcoin has attracted widespread speculation and hoarding among its users, with very little money velocity, and those factors are not indicative of those seen in a currency. Said more succinctly; people simply don't *use* Bitcoin like a currency, and that is largely due to its deflationary nature.

The economy would utterly grind to a halt if people only bought things when they absolutely needed them. "Need" is a pretty tricky word - very little of what we use in our day to day life is truly essential. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile.


That's not hoarding, that's investing. Thanks for bringing that up as another example of why inflation is a desirable characteristic for a modern economy.


Yep, I already talked about why that's a bad thing.


This might be a decent point, except that the mechanisms for controlling inflation are well understood and the Fed generally does a bang-up job at it. (*see, e.g.,* Paul Volcker). That is the exact reason the Fed shoots for targeted inflation: it's much less damaging to an economy, and a helluva lot easier to control than deflation. Just look at the ECB, which is so concerned about warding off deflation that they implemented a [negative deposit rate,]( a radical move which has no precedent, because there's not much else one can do to combat deflation.

The argument for why deflation is bad has been discussed ad nauseum by anyone who's taken Econ 101.  You want a TL;DR?  Falling prices depresses demand because (1) consumers have a rational incentive to save instead of spend, (2) the rising cost of debt further discourages the use of and impedes the flow of credit, and (3) downward pressure on wages exacerbates the effects of (1) and (2).  Mild controlled inflation is a vastly superior option.

In a nutshell: because we can't control deflation, and inflation is a better alternative. Did you study the Great Depression? Some economists consider that the by-product of a deflationary spiral. Everyone knows Bernanke was a student of the Depression, and his policies as Fed Chairman reflected his fears of being caught in another one. He recognized that if you aren't inflating, you're deflating, and the easiest way to combat deflation is through inflation. 
So why is deflation so bad? Well, let's look at what happens if you can't inflate. The Eurozone is struggling with that very issue [right now.]( Deflation is bad for an economy, especially a struggling one, because in addition to the issues I noted above, it exacerbates debts, which limits access to capital and slows recovery even further. 
Capital is essential, even for a healthy economy, regardless of what believes. Look at it this way: if resources represent the organs and muscles of an economy, credit is its lifeblood. Nothing happens without it. The financial crisis of 2008 didn't happen because we ran out of oil or whatever. It happened because (in a nutshell) banks began hoarding cash, and refused to lend to anyone out of fears of future margin calls like the one that brought down Lehman. The entire point of TARP was to open up credit again and get the economy moving after it had ground to an unceremonious halt.
Now imagine what happened in 2008 on a national scale. Banks aren't the only ones who lend money: you and I do, too, when we make deposits and investments. But what if money is deflating faster than any potential ROI? Everyone stops recklessly consuming, sure, but they stop investing too. People instead stick their money in a coffee can and wait for it to appreciate, because they are getting richer every day they don't spend it. 
Deflation doesn't discriminate. You might be ok with people eschewing luxury cars and Gucci purses, but would you be ok without advances in medicine and science? Without a military? Without public services? All of those things are funded by the same thing as purchases in consumer goods: credit.  Credit is necessary for a modern economy to function, and the only way we can make sure credit keeps flowing is by putting the right incentives in place. Incentives that make it a rational choice to take our money out of the coffee can and put it to work. And there is only way we know how to do that: Inflation. But if you have a better idea, by all means, I would be open to hearing it.

Capitalism doesn't "use" game theory, and that's not what game theory says. What game theory does say is that people will act rationally to further their best interests.

Almost, not quite. The intent of QE is to stimulate growth by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. While this may have the effect of increasing inflation, it's not the goal. If it were, the Fed would have failed spectacularly, given the fact that inflation has slowed despite the Fed pumping $4.5 trillion into the economy.


Every country does this. Inflating away debts isn't unique to the dollar.

But let's run with your hypothetical for a second. Sure, Bitcoin provides an advantage over cash (assuming I don't have $30) or check (because who even uses checks anymore?). But I can just as easily use Venmo / Paypal / Square / Apple Pay / Google Wallet / Snapcash / FB / any other number of services the seller is more likely to already have than Bitcoin.

Just because the Govt. lies about some things doesn't mean it's lying about others. You're simply poisoning the wells because you don't like the Govt.


The first article criticizes the method of calculating inflation but neither proposes a better method nor actually estimates what the true rate of inflation is, so I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make.  It's also written by one blogger of one magazine (a blogger who has been [highly critical of Bitcoin's flaws, btw](

Ideally, I'd like to see someone go to prison, too. But it's not that simple. Banks are massive organizations with thousands of employees working collaboratively. It's very rare that any one individual person knows enough to be held individually culpable for the actions of an entire organization.

It absolutely didn't. Glass-Steagall was *intended* to prevent commercial banks from engaging in risky investment activities through their own accounts or through banking affiliates. In reality, GSA was an immensely flawed bill that accomplished almost nothing. Banks were already becoming mega-consolidated financial supermarkets long before GLB repealed Glass-Steagall.
More relevantly to your point, GSA was never intended to prevent banks from investing on their own account with depositor funds, also known as "co-mingling." That was illegal both before and after its repeal, and is still illegal today. Again, I'll direct you to MF Global as an example, where creditors alleged that the company illegally dipped into $1.2 billion in segregated customer funds for its own operations. What those critics you cited are probably arguing is that the consolidation of commercial and investment banks permitted banks to *leverage* their depository accounts to obtain lower interest rates and enhance liquidity on the repo markets. But they were never allowed to outright gamble with that money.

It's been a couple years since Con Law, but I don't remember seeing that one in our bill of rights. In fact, I'm pretty sure the Constitution explicitly gives Congress broad authority to regulate interstate commerce. We've had banking regulations since the very inception of our country, so I'm not really sure what you're complaining about. 


Yeah, gonna need a source on that one. Or a logical argument. Your call.

It's instances like this that the regulators fail. And they continue to fail, time and time again. Whether it's the S&amp;L crises, the derivatives-market crisis, the home mortgage crises, etc. to the point whereby a reasonable person begins to question, "Who are they actually serving?"
You know why the 2008 financial crisis happened? It's not because regulators weren't doing their jobs. It's because our legislators had been steadily *deregulating* the financial markets for over a decade. A big reason nobody got prosecuted is because the GFC primarily occurred through the use of dangerous, unregulated, and *completely legal* derivatives like CDSs and synthetic CDOs. Brooksley Born lobbied for more regulation all the way back in 1998, and she got pushed out of the CFTC so Congress could pass the CFMA and do the exact opposite. The same Congress that was busy passing GLB to help out their buddies over at Citi and pushing subprime mortgages on low-income buyers with the CRA. So you can point fingers at a lot of people, but you can't really blame the regulators, as they were doing exactly what we told them to do - nothing.

It absolutely does. Pursuant to explicit instructions in its dual mandate, the Fed routinely utilizes a variety of tools to maintain price stability, and its damn good at doing so - inflation hasn't deviated more than 2% from the 2% target in over a decade. This is impossible without a centralized authority making conscious decisions regarding monetary policy. 


Right, I will continue to use a currency that slowly loses small amounts of value at a predictable rate over long periods of time. You can continue to use one that loses and gains value completely randomly and without provocation. I'll know roughly what my savings will be worth in ten years - can you say the same about your bitcoins?


Lol no. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.


Hmm seems like it's maybe *not that easy then.* Unless your conception of a "perfect money" is one that people routinely lose because they forgot to epoxy all of their ethernet ports after step 47 of *Securing Your Life Savings for Dummies*.

@_date: 2019-11-05 12:37:14
Dude, this is all so wrong I almost feel bad for all the money you've left on the table. You're massively overstating fees, first of all. Morningstar cites average fee structure at 0.45% all-in, and there are plenty of 401(k) plans for far less. No idea why you think Vanguard funds aren't commonly offered, they're literally the largest direct contribution provider in the country with over $1.2 trillion AUM. It's their bread and butter lol. But honestly all of this is completely irrelevant because a 401(k) is TAX FREE MONEY. You're arguing over bps while paying 30-40% more before you even start.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:52:19


No, there isn't, since Bitcoin isn't a company, doesn't issue stock and its market cap is therefore $0. What you mean is that there are plenty of countries whose currency has a smaller aggregate value than that of Bitcoin. 


Size is irrelevant to whether a currency is "generally accepted." In those countries, small as they may be, their currency is generally accepted. Bitcoin is not "generally accepted" anywhere. The aggregate value of Bitcoin could equal the USD and it still wouldn't be a currency unless and until it is widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.

This is also nonsense. "Store of value" does not mean the value never changes. It just means value will be retained into the future. If you can predict what that value will be, even better. Hence why USD is a *superior* store of value compared to BTC.  
Also, you get a hearty lol for trying to argue that a "currency" is not money. You should probably Google those terms. 
@_date: 2019-11-16 12:31:23

And yet, dollars *aren't* volatile, because there is a central authority (boo hiss) ensuring consistent mild inflation. Bitcoin lacks such a mechanism by design, ensuring that it will always be more volatile comparatively. 
Moreover, there are trillions and trillions of dollars in circulation, which are held and used by billions of people around the globe. Bitcoin can have, at most, 21 million, and the vast majority are either lost or held by less than 100 people. It will always be more volatile due to that simple fact. 


I think the hundreds (thousands?) of people who have lost their Bitcoins through theft, mistake, technical failure or exchange collapse would beg to differ. "Be your own bank" is not easy or simple for the vast majority of people. 


You are contradicting yourself. You can't claim that it's perfect but also volatile. It will also *always* be volatile, for the reasons outlined above.
@_date: 2016-06-22 01:31:52


You can't honestly be this dense. USD is generally accepted in the country of its issuance, *America.* It's also generally accepted in exchange for other currencies around the world. That it's not generally accepted in an entirely different country is beyond irrelevant.


This statement contradicts itself. It's also incorrect, as bitcoin is not generally accepted *anywhere.*


I'm not playing this game. It is abundantly clear that Bitcoin is not "generally accepted" under any reasonable interpretation. Forget 10% - it would be a massive accomplishment if even *1%* of online merchants accepted it.

Ok so I work in securities, and there are about a hundred reasons this wouldn't work. A big one is because regulatory regimes vary dramatically from country to country - Jim from California can't just up and sell his shares of Google and to Hans in Frankfurt. There are selling restrictions which must be complied with, certain information that must be disclosed, regulatory agencies from which one must obtain approval, company charters that dictate the manner and ability to transfer one's shares, etc.  Moreover, there are certain types of securities which can't be sold outside of the U.S., others which can't be sold *within* the U.S., others that can only be sold to specific types of investors or in limited amounts, etc. 
Point is, there's a reason why lawyers get involved with the purchase and sale of securities. This stuff can be extremely complicated and we are lightyears away from removing humans from the process. It's not as simple as just saying "durr let's just put it on the blockchain".

ICOs were dead in the U.S. the moment the SEC determined that utility tokens were securities. Absolutely nobody is going to go through the trouble and expense of registering an ICO, and none of the exchanges want to tempt the SEC's wrath by selling them to Americans.

As I posted above, you can't just put securities on the blockchain and say "welp, they're global now - go crazy ya'll." There's a number of reasons why securities exchanges aren't global, and even if they were, most securities themselves aren't global either.

Just because a state legally considers gold to be legal tender does not mean you can buy something with it - you've got to find some loony goldbug willing to accept it. I don't doubt there are one or two loony goldbugs out there willing to do so, but that doesn't mean its "widely accepted" as is required for something to be considered currency.

Market cap refers to the aggregate value of all outstanding shares of a company. Now, bitcoin isn't a company so it doesn't make sense to refer to its "market cap" in the first place, but since this sub insists on doing so, it should at a minimum be calculated correctly, which necessitates accounting for those bitcoins which are effectively removed from circulation. The "market cap" stated in the OP is incorrectly inflated by an unknown amount, possibly up to 33% or more.
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:04:52

Not necessarily either. Price is a reflection of supply and **demand.** You're ignoring half of the equation. You can't calculate market cap by just assuming the value of a lost bitcoin spreads out across all the others.

I already did, and it does - "total value" or "aggregate value" are both commonly used in similar contexts. Market cap literally makes no sense and using it in this context is an immediate signal that someone doesn't know what they're talking about.

Good God, this is too much. **Bitcoin is not a company and cannot have a market cap.** You're comparing the estimated total value of an asset (a massive and unknown proportion of which is lost forever) to the aggregate value of outstanding shares of a company. Those are two entirely different things and conflating the two makes it impossible to take this sub seriously.

First of all, the 2% back is off gross purchases, not purchases minus APR. 
Second, if you don't carry a balance or only carry balances on 0% APR promotional rate cards you don't pay any APR. 
Third, the 3% fee (which is almost always negotiated to lower than 3% fyi) is rolled into the cost of doing business generally, not tacked on as a surcharge for each customer who pays with card. A $60 game costs the same regardless of whether you pay with bitcoin, credit card or cash. So in reality, by paying with Bitcoin *you're* paying the 3%, *plus* miner's fees, while those who pay with credit card will get most of that cost refunded.

Let's play this out. I want a loan, you have bitcoin to lend. How do I find you? Are you licensed to lend money? How do you investigate my creditworthiness? Who drafts the documentation? How do you enforce payment? What happens if I default?
Unless and until you can answer those questions and a dozen more, that's why you need a bank. 


Thats not really responsive. Even if, in the distant future, equity ownership is tracked using colored coins, banks will still be required to underwrite security offerings.  




I don't think you understood what the capital markets are or how they work. Banks play an essential role in ensuring the liquidity and efficient allocation of capital. There's just no way bitcoin can serve that role - it doesn't make any sense. Especially considering the bitcoin markets are fairly illiquid to begin with.

Let me break this down very clearly: getting paid in your local currency, holding some in your bank account, and using it on a regular basis, is not speculation. Americans do not "speculate" on the USD just because they use it IRL. Speculation specifically refers to the practice of engaging in transactions for the sole purpose of achieving significant financial gain but which also carries a substantial risk of loss. Since basically nobody actually uses bitcoin, or any other crypto, for any purpose beyond betting on its value, the vast majority of activity in this space can be defined as speculation. This isn't really up for debate. 


The vast and overwhelming majority of people hold exactly one currency at any given time, and that is the local currency of the country in which they live. If they simultaneously hold other currencies, such as in Zimbabwe or Venezuela, it is only because those other currencies are also commonly accepted. Very, very few people ever engage in currency speculation. 


I don't think you understand what arbitrage is. Or speculation, for that matter.

You're comparing countries which greatly restrict(ed) their citizens' freedom of movement to countries where citizens enjoy mostly unrestricted freedom of movement. Citizens of the former did not have the ability to pack up and leave if they disagreed with their government, unlike those of the latter. So even ignoring the ridiculousness of comparing East fucking Germany to modern day US, your argument fails because it doesn't address the obvious fact that citizens *who are free to leave whenever they want* consent to their government's rule every single day they voluntarily remain within their borders and under the purview of their laws. Nobody's forcing you to play ball, but if you want to join the league, you have to follow the rules. This is glaringly obvious to anybody with an ounce of critical thinking skills, and I'm honestly a little flabbergasted I'm being forced to spell this out to someone in the year twenty-fucking-fifteen.


Because the vast, *overwhelming* majority of people disagree with you. Simple as that. Look bud, you've got two options in life - play by the rules just like everyone else, or take your ball and go home. I suppose the third option is to try and convince enough people to follow your tantrum and storm off the court, and if you can manage that well bully for you, but you've got an uphill battle ahead of you.

Let me start by saying that I like bitcoin, I really do. Even had some myself back in the day. I think it's a cool technology with a lot of neat applications, especially as a short- to medium-term store of value and as an international payment and remittance network. 
But you've got to understand - when you guys start talking about bitcoin replacing the USD, you come across like *absolute lunatics.* You're talking about an extremely niche technology with a valuation at a quarter of *Snapchat,* and which currently suffers from a variety of technological limitations that would prevent it from effectively functioning as a currency for a *single country,* much less the entire world.
So let me just ask you guys: how do you see this going down? Logistically, what do you see happening in the next 10-15 years that could **realistically** result in bitcoin becoming the world's reserve currency?

Actually since nobody yet offers free fraud protection for bitcoin transactions the answer is zero, but I get your point. 
Here's what I don't get. Why are you bringing up these other uses for bitcoin where fraud protection isn't as important when this entire comment thread was specifically discussing online purchases, the one scenario we've both identified where fraud protection *is* important? I never said bitcoin had *no* value without fraud protection, only that bitcoin doesn't add value over traditional payment systems when making online purchases. I don't understand how that's controversial, or why this sub has such a hard-on for self-masturbatory fever dreams where bitcoin replaces Visa.

Ok, I'm going to call you out a little bit here, because this is *exactly* what I'm talking about. You admit that a million things would need to happen for the OP's scenario to occur, but you're just assuming that they will. You even throw in the occurrence of an "ideological shift" like it's some common, easily predictable event. You've presented exactly nothing to support your argument beyond your saying so.

@_date: 2015-07-24 19:30:49
Ok almost all of that was complete nonsense, so I'll just address this:


First of all, it's *not my job* to disprove the OP's stance. It's *your job* to support it with an argument. The burden falls squarely on you. Saying that I only think it's unlikely because I support the "status quo" is analogous to my saying that in 10-15 years we might live on Mars, and you just think it's unlikely because you're too blinded by having only lived a life on Earth. *Of course* the status quo influences our opinions, it's what we experience every day. But if somebody comes in and says "hey guys, we should do it this other way instead," it's up to him to prove why the other way is superior. All you've done is shit all over the current system (with *extremely* dubious ~~levels of sanity~~ logic) without making a single argument as to *why* Bitcoin would be an improvement, or *how* we might find ourselves with a bitcoin-based reserve currency.
Second, I *have* put forward several arguments for why I think it's ridiculous, but I'll repeat them here for your benefit. Beyond the undesirability of a deflationary currency (which I won't get into here), I see two major problems which are yet unaddressed by anyone: First, that bitcoin can only process 2.7 tx/ second. It would need to scale by a factor of 1000 just to compete with Visa. How on Earth is it ever going to scale to a sufficient level to function as a global currency?  Second, that the distribution of bitcoins are *ridiculously* unequal, to the point where Satoshi alone has the power to significantly manipulate markets. Maybe a dozen users have roughly 1/3 of all the bitcoins that will ever be mined. Doesn't that strike you as a seriously damning problem?

Nah, it's more bitcoiners with a vested interest in pretending that banks are worse than they are. If banks and apps like Venmo let you transfer money instantly for free, it's a big strike against the utility of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-24 15:31:54


I totally agree with this. There is plenty of room for bitcoin to exist alongside the USD and within the confines of our current financial system. There's no reason it needs to revolutionize everything. 


It's not pointless if you take that statistic for what it means - that currently, bitcoin is *tiny.* I mean really, *really* tiny. Doesn't mean it won't become huge one day, but it does make the OP's argument a harder sell when considering its current size after 6 years of existence.

I'm not *expecting* Bitcoin to have anything. I'm pointing out that in its current state, Bitcoin's lack of fraud protection makes it an inferior option for online purchases. It's a positive statement, not a normative one.


Interest rates and fees have a lot more to do with covering default risk than with covering chargebacks but yeah, it contributes. How does that affect someone like me, who uses their no-fee CC responsibly and doesn't carry a balance from month-to-month?


Is it even *possible* to have such bad credit you don't qualify for any card? Shit, people who recently declared bankruptcy can get credit cards. My dog was once pre-qualified for a card. I don't think this is a situation that affects many people. 
Regardless, you don't need credit to use a debit or check card, and those offer the same fraud protections.


I agree with this. I've said repeatedly that I think bitcoin has huge potential as a short- to medium- term counter-cyclical store of value and as an international payment and remittance network. What I don't think it has the potential to do is replace Visa. This sub seems to have a big problem with that viewpoint.

It makes a lot more sense to approach bitcoin as a commodity than as a currency, since by and large people *treat it* like a commodity. It also has many characteristics more typical of a commodity like gold or silver - slight intrinsic value, artificial scarcity, production limited by the economics of mining more, etc. Unfortunately, people in this sub tend to get very upset when I voice that opinion.

In a nutshell, because Greece (1) misrepresented its finances to gain entry into (2) an utterly flawed economic union which lacks a fiscal transfer mechanism (3) while racking up huge amounts of debt during an economic expansion (4) thanks to countries like Germany who were more than happy to provide endless cheap credit and (5) are now demanding unreasonable concessions which ignore the fact that Greece *needs* a haircut on their debt and are literally incapable of paying it back thanks to, among other factors, (6) an enormous black-market economy, terrible infrastructure, extraordinarily corrupt politicians, generous pensions, high youth unemployment, and a tourism-heavy economy that has suffered during a global recession.

@_date: 2015-07-25 12:36:46
No, it's not, and you probably shouldn't be relying on Wikipedia to contradict someone.
QE does increase the money supply, but that doesn't necessarily cause inflation. QE involves a central bank buying assets from member banks in exchange for newly created reserves. This increases the reserve cash available to member banks, but also correspondingly increases the assets held by the central bank, meaning that the net size of financial assets in the economy remains constant. If it helps, think of QE as a liquidity swap. The purpose is to stimulate *growth,* not inflation, by encouraging banks to lend by giving them excess liquidity. Now, when the member banks loan out that money, some inflation will definitely occur, but the idea is that the economic growth spurred by this lending will counteract that. So while some inflation may occur following QE, it's a by-product, not the primary purpose. Contrast that with straight money printing, which is inflationary by design since it injects cash directly into circulation.

What a terrible idea - mitigating the potential damage of fraud! Most people don't make $6,000 purchases with debit cards, despite what the OP seems to think. It is perfectly reasonable, and I would argue even desirable, for the bank to make sure such a large and unusual purchase is legitimate. 
It's also to protect *you* from having no money while the bank investigates.
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:16:34


Ok first of all, let's not gloss over the fact that you're just assuming they're referring to chargeback fraud. There are other ways to scam a company than by using a credit card.
Even if they are, I suspect the proximate issue in this case has more to do with avoiding issues relating to international customs and duties. Consider why bitcoin is *only* accepted for international purchases and not domestic ones. There are plenty of countries where sex toys are considered "obscene" and have a risk of being seized at the border, followed by the customer cancelling the purchase on their card. Now, instead of the seller eating that expense as a cost of doing business, the risk falls squarely on the buyer. That's not how things should work.

There was nothing "reluctant" about the agreement: Ross sought out the hitman on his own accord, negotiated a price, provided the details, and even referenced a previous hit he had ordered in the past. In fact, the hitman even tried to dissuade Ross from using a lethal option numerous times.

@_date: 2015-07-24 16:58:43
I appreciate your being the first person to actually take a crack at answering this.


So, two things. First, QE ended nearly a year ago, and the dollar has actually strengthened since then. There's a lot of debate about whether QE causes inflation, but the evidence suggests that it doesn't - not significantly, anyway, and not by itself. Remember that QE =/= money printing. 
Second, even if we assume that inflation increases beyond the normal ~2% / year, it doesn't logically follow that the world would then drop the USD and adopt bitcoin. There's a reason why every country on earth uses an inflationary currency - they work. I don't want to get into the merits of inflationary versus deflationary currencies here, but it would take a lot more than mild inflation for every country to collectively decide that fiat currencies are *passé* and that bitcoin is the answer. Sure, world-wide hyperinflation might prompt a paradigm shift away from fiat, but there's no indication of that occurring anytime soon, despite the clamoring of the goldbugs over at Zerohedge.


I'm more referring to the limitations of only being able to process 2.7 tx/ second. I haven't followed the block size debates closely, but it's my understanding that even if we increase the block size to 20MB, the network will still be woefully inadequate to process the volume required to serve as the world's currency. I mean, bitcoin would need to scale by [a factor of 1000]( just to compete with Visa alone. I haven't heard any real proposal for dealing with this limitation beyond mythical vaporware like "Lightning" and "Sidechains."

Unless you are a professional Forex trader, currency speculation is just as risky as crypto speculation. Pretending that you, an average Joe, can consistently arbitrage anything more than laughably marginal  gains in currency markets is honestly a bit delusional. 


Well yeah, no duh. Everybody diversifies their investments because, again, sticking money in a checking account is not investing. But as mentioned above, currency speculation is a quick way to lose money and is inadvisable for 99% of people.

Of course there's a *chance* we could have a recession; like I said, historically it's about time for one anyway. But these jokers are just capitalizing on the markets' current volatility by making wild predictions on the off chance they're right. ZH predicted all 1000 of the last two recessions too.

That's not entrapment, and it doesn't make Ross look any less guilty. Entrapment requires the police to induce the defendant into committing a crime they otherwise would not have committed.

You guys need to talk to a lawyer, because what you're proposing is very likely to get all of you fined and/or thrown in jail for contempt of court. 18 U.S.C. § 2705 broadly prohibits "notify[ing] any other person of the existence of the warrant, subpoena or court order." If your inaction would result in notifying another person, you're just as guilty as if you shouted it from the rooftops. Your idea isn't as clever as you think it is, and judges generally have zero patience for people pulling stunts in their courtroom.

Price inflation = inflation. Monetary inflation *may* lead to inflation, but not always - look at the Yen right now, or the USD over the past couple of years. 


This is just restating the definition of inflation. Inflation is a loss in the purchasing power of a currency.

Lol gtfo of here with your condescending attitude. I "get" bitcoin just fine. What I don't "get" is why anyone would ever decline free automatic fraud protection. All you've offered is platitudes about "freedom" and "choice", but if everyone would just choose the fraud protection anyway, all you've done is describe a system which *at best* provides zero benefit over traditional payment methods. 


Yeah, and it's a dumb way to use bitcoin, in part for the reasons I just mentioned.

This is incorrect. Inflation (rising prices) occurs for a variety of reasons - economic growth, population growth, market failure, supply shocks, etc. Central banks engage in expansionary monetary policies most frequently *in response* to inflation which has already occurred (remember that MV = Py). While it's certainly possible that a massive over-expansion of M1 could result in inflation, it is by no means certain: again, look at the USD or the Yen for examples. 


The obvious flaw in your theory is that bitcoin inflates all the time for *external* reasons, just like I described above.

Look, I work in securities, and I can tell you that you are incorrect. AI status is not solely based on income; it can also be attained by having a net worth &gt; $1,000,000, and a retiree worth less than that flat-out should not be risking their livelihood on insanity like crypto or start-up ventures. Moreover, you don't even need to be an AI - Reg D allows participation by up to 35 non-accredited investors (with limitations, as you noted), and 4(a)(2) provides a broad exemption for anyone who can demonstrate financial sophistication (aka QIBs in practice). And then of course you've got the crowdfunding exemption.

Nobody thinks Keynesianism is infalliable. But the Austrian school is a fringe doctrine at best, and people around here treat it like gospel because it fits with the anti-US, pro-Bitcoin narrative. Most of didn't give two shits about economics before they became emotionally invested in an ideology that benefits them financially. So when those of us who have actually studied economics for years see people spouting off about how QE will lead to hyperinflation and deflation is good for a currency, it's extremely frustrating, particularly given their obvious pecuniary motivation.
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:10:08


Sad how all your "better information" doesn't equate to better reading comprehension. I didn't say *employment* has recovered to pre-2008 levels, I said *unemployment* has - big difference. LFPR has declined in America since the early 2000s and is attributable to a variety of factors other than the recession, most notably increased worker productivity and our aging and retiring population.
I also never said wages or net worth have recovered. I said wage pressure is *starting* to build (which is true); I never even mentioned anything about net worth. Obviously net worth hasn't recovered for the average household and won't for some time, but that's tangential to the issue of the health of the overall economy in relation to the rest of the world. 
As an aside, you can claim you're just being "realistic," but let's call a spade a spade: what you're actually doing is being needlessly contrarian to push your narrative that the U.S. is in the shitter and we must, therefore, adopt your fringe economic theories to fix it. I'm not getting sucked into that rabbit hole again. So if you'd like to support your original assertion that U.S. strength and influence has been falling "rather rapidly," feel free, but that's all I'm interested in discussing with you.

This is a stupid analogy. You aren't a government, you don't produce anything I want, and nobody else in the world cares who you are. 


This is obvious. Nobody said the price was wholly determined by government. The point is that the only reason the market even *cares* about the USD's value is *because* the US Govt backs it. If Yellen went on TV tomorrow and said they were switching from dollars to FreedomBux and nobody was allowed to accept dollars anymore, dollars would become essentially worthless and everyone would start talking about the exchange rates of FreedomBux to Euros or whatever.
In a way, you actually proved my point for me in an earlier post and I didn't even realize it. You said:


And you're absolutely correct. The dollar's value comes from its usefulness as a currency... and why is the dollar useful? Because the US Government says it is and requires things to be paid in it.

It's not, and it does, and you have to think a bit more abstractly to understand why. You're correct that in a vacuum, the dollar is just a piece of paper that's not worth anything. But, unlike bitcoin, the dollar doesn't derive its value solely from what other people say it's worth. It derives its value from the fact that the U.S. government *chose* the dollar to be its official currency. It's the only legal tender in America, so if you want to live here, you'll have to pay taxes, and you'll have to pay them in dollars. The government collects, what, $3 trillion in annual revenue? That's a huge demand for dollars right there, from everyone who wants to live in America or do business with Americans. If it helps, you can almost think of dollars as tax credits. Not to mention the fact that oil is traded in dollars (DAE petrodollar?)
Tl;dr: The dollar has value not because *we* say it does, but because the government of the largest, most powerful nation on Earth says it does. That is what "backing" means.

First of all, that's why [TIPS]( exist. Second, that would only be a problem if inflation was severe and unexpected. The Fed is very good at both controlling inflation and signalling inflationary pressures to the market. In other words, that information should be incorporated into the price of T-bonds. And it's not like you're forced to hold the bond until it matures, you can always sell early if you're worried about higher than expected inflation.

Deflation discourages spending and investment, which lowers wages and increases unemployment. It's also really hard to control deflation, due to a lack of any effective policy tools. For instance, the ECB is so desperate to stave off deflation that they are implementing a negative interest rate, a tool which has never been implemented in such a large scale. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:35:17
So if I'm understanding you, your argument basically boils down to the belief that interest rates at the ZLB are single-handedly propping up the stock market, and if we remove that prop, the stock market will crash, bringing down everything else with it. Is that about right? 
You should know, first of all, that there are a variety of policy tools the Fed has in its back pocket besides ZIRP to stimulate growth. People act like the Fed hasn't raised rates yet because their hands are tied, but why *would* they raise rates when growth has been modest and inflation has remained low? 
Even if the Fed raises rates and stocks take a dive, why would that cause a collapse worse than ever seen before? Your post is pure fearmongering.

Yeah, none of this is true. I can make an online transfer, for free, any time of the day or night, directly from my bank to any other major bank. I can use Venmo or Square or Snapcash or Apple Pay or Facebook payments. I have never seen or heard of the moneygram system being "down." And Paypal (I can't believe I'm about to defend them) doesn't require a credit card or a bank account - you can walk down the street to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card, and simply use that.


You have a citation for any of this, or would facts just get in the way of your circlejerk?
This is what I hate about this subreddit. Bitcoin is an amazing technology with plenty of merit on its own. Why do you have to ruin it by coming across like some common two-bit snake oil salesman? Making grandoise, easily falsifiable claims doesn't support your case; it makes you sound like a huckster trying to pass the bag, or worse, a delusional cultist whose opinion will be discounted immediately by everyone who hasn't already drunk the Kool-Aid.

In 1970, your definition would be correct. It is not correct today. Dollars are "backed" by the collective assets of the Federal Reserve member banks and the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. That is the correct answer, full stop. Every single dollar in circulation is a liability of the Fed and a legal obligation of the U.S. Government. *See* 12 U.S.C. § 411. 
There's really no debate about this. If you don't think that constitutes "backing," well then I don't know what else to tell you except that you are adhering to an incorrect and outdated definition, and one that is demonstrably false given that dollars *do* have value even without an underlying commodity supporting them.
@_date: 2015-09-13 18:07:23


I mean, it's Roger Ver. What did you expect? 
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:52:09
No, I'm actually correct. Congress granted the Federal Reserve the exclusive authority to issue dollars as legal tender, which are legally required to be accepted by the U.S. government to satisfy all debts. The signature of the treasury secretary is stamped on every dollar bill to certify this fact. So if you want to split hairs, dollars are backed by the Fed, which is backed by the U.S. Government. Either way, its full faith and credit stands behind every cent.

No, it's not not a useful debate, because nobody with half a brain cell would ever consider a statement like "the government produces things" to be debatable. You really want a list of what the government has produced? How about the most expansive and advanced interstate highway system in the world (at the time it was built). Countless technologies that you use every day, including the internet. A robust public education system. Clean water, fresh air, cheap electricity, and one of the largest systems of national parks in the world. Oh, and let's not forget the Constitution itself, a document which has served as the model for dozens of other world governments.

No they arent, because everyone knows polls are meaningless at this stage in the game. They gauge name recognition and not much else because most people haven't yet started paying serious attention to the election.
The "party establishment" cares more about the fact that they have zero plausible candidates 11 months out (against *Hillary,* of all people), and the only GOP candidate anyone knows about is going against the grain and playing a spoiler role. Trump is pro-taxing the rich and pro-choice, which alienates him from hard-line right wingers and Christian conservatives (aka the base of GOP support) but plays well in Peoria. At the same time, those relatively moderate viewpoints exacerbate middle America's opinion that other passengers in the GOP clown car are a bunch of right wing radicals advocating the same tired line of God, Guns, and Country (with a flat tax that's totally not regressive guys!). But that has nothing to do with whether anyone seriously believes Trump can win, because literally everybody in the know  (and quite likely even Trump himself) knows that he cant, *especially* without GOP support.
TL;DR: Trump can't win without his party's support and he won't get it, but he's ruining it for the "real" Republicans. That's the only reason the "establishment" gives two shits about Trump.

In a perfectly competitive market with perfectly rational actors who have perfect information, sure. But I think it's clear that we don't have that here, for a number of reasons:
- The unregulated nature of bitcoin markets means the price is almost certainly manipulated to some extent, especially given the shallow market cap, low velocity, and heavily consolidated ownership. 
- Even if the markets aren't directly manipulated, I don't think anybody would claim we have perfect information.
- Actors in the bitcoin sphere aren't perfectly rational, or even pretend to be. A huge number of "hodlers" proudly boast that their stake in bitcoin is for purely ideological, rather than economic, reasons. Others are motivated by irrational beliefs, such as an imminent collapse of the USD. 
So no, it's not as simple as simply saying "scarcity + utility = value." That's a very oversimplified, "Econ 101" way of looking at things.

Ok, I'll bite. 
First off, why would anyone ever want to be paid in Bitcoin? Even if volatility disappears entirely (essentially impossible due to the inherent properties of crypto), goods and services are priced in dollars and always will be. But even if your incredibly implausible scenario were to occur, the answer to your question is *absolutely* - the vast majority of people will keep their savings in a bank. Most people have zero interest in "being their own bank." Its complicated, risky and serves zero benefit to anyone who doesn't buy into the insane conspiratorial worldview peddled by the likes of ZH and this subreddit. 
Moreover, even if the depository function of banks somehow disappears, it still would not displace their role as underwriters, loan originators (which does *not* depend on deposits, by the way), investment managers, analysts, etc etc.  They do a lot more than just take deposits and Bitcoin can't do any of that.

This is a really simplistic and misleading view of how deficit spending works.

Deficit spending is actually an extremely important tool, and modern government quite literally could not run without it.

You do not understand words obviously, since I never said or implied that. I pointed out that what you were describing - passing expenses onto the consumer via higher prices - is not a surcharge. A surcharge is an additional fee added on top of the price. By your definition, we also pay a surcharge for the business' rent, taxes and employee wages (hint: we don't). Don't use incorrect terminology and get indignant when people don't understand what you mean. 


My degree in economics would beg to differ. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 14:17:49
That impression is incorrect. Credit card companies may charge the merchant up to (and often less than) 3% for processing that merchant's transaction, but that doesn't necessarily get passed on to the consumer. 
Even if it did, 2% cash back means the consumer is only paying 1% at most, and in exchange receives a convenient, universally accepted payment method with robust fraud and theft protection built in. More than a fair trade IMO.

*What?* How does owning part of a company make you indebted or a slave?




So your solution is to create a system where the incentive to innovate and produce has an *inverse* relationship with wealth, which will simultaneously discourage innovation and production while increasing inequality? This is either completely nonsensical or colossally stupid.

Replace "Bitcoin" with "Litecoin" or "Monero" or any other alt and your logic breaks down.

Moreover, "averages" are awful indicators without accounting for outliers.

Separately, I find it hilarious (and a little sad) that you think ~2% controlled inflation is somehow more damaging than a hyper-consolidated currency that's inflated over 70% in one year. I mean, you've got to be in great shape to perform such complicated mental gymnastics.

Not nearly to the same extent, no. The FOREX market is widely distributed and extremely liquid. 


Here's a fun idea: find me a ten-year period in American history where a large cap, stock-indexed fund returned a consistently negative ROI. (Don't look too hard, it's never happened).

The sale of stock is highly regulated to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation. Roughly 8 people own something like 30% of all bitcoins. Bitcoin's volatility isn't natural - it's almost certainly manufactured and/or exacerbated by whales.

Yes, I actually am using three such credit cards, all of which have no annual fee and all of which provide for 1-2% cash back. All three also had introductory 0% APR periods of 12 months or longer. I'm not going to name the specific ones I use because (1) this is the internet and I would rather not reveal that information and (2) there's absolutely no reason to lie about something which is very easily verifiable with a quick google search.
I can't speak to the credit card situation in other countries because I don't live there. All I ever claimed was that at least here, in the U.S., no annual fee cash-back credit cards are incredibly common, as are free checking accounts.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:58:12
Absolutely untrue. I've never been charged $1.03 for a coke just because I paid with a credit card. Feel free to provide a source proving me wrong.

The Euro is not "backed" by Greece lol

I don't think that word means what you think it means.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:57:04
I'd prefer not to say as this is the internet, but it's not uncommon - all major banks will reverse fraudulent charges for free, and the consumer's liability for fraudulent charges is limited to $50 [by law]( provided they notify their bank within 60 days.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:21:19
Who cares if it's *more* secure if there's no recourse? It makes no difference to me if it's 75% or 95% safe - a risk is a risk. What matters is my ability to be compensated for any losses. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:16:38
Merchants already can, and sometimes do, offer discounts for cash payments (this is distinct from a surcharge, as you are describing). It's not frequently seen because the benefits of accepting a credit card are worth the expense.
@_date: 2016-07-22 02:28:56


And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:59:21


When was the last you sent an international wire? Because my bank charges half that. Still too much, but not $80.
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:11:55


I pay nothing in credit card fees. So they're actually quite large, relatively. 


Said every person without evidence. Even if your argument that fees get baked in is correct, until and unless bitcoin discounts become commonplace, everyone pays the fees equally anyway, regardless of payment method. Might as well get my 2% cash back.


FDIC insurance, fraud and theft protections are all pretty big advantages. "Be your own bank" isn't really a selling point when most people have no idea what that entails.




I googled "how old to use debit cards in UK" and got roughly a million links disproving you. Barclay's offers a [Children's Debit Card,]( for chrissakes. 


Implying that bitcoins can be used to purchase goods directly, when we both know that there are basically zero merchants who accept it.


Absolutely not. I'm recognizing that theft will always occur regardless of payment method, and I would prefer to be protected. If my info gets swiped, I get reimbursed. If your bitcoins get swiped, SFYL.


Nope. Just pointing out facts. I personally think that Bitcoin has some cool applications, but its utility as a POS transaction system is not one of them, and I get frustrated seeing such blatant misinformation bandied about in this sub. If it really offers as many benefits as you claim, you should be able to support your argument without distorting facts. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:24:27


That comparison to the internet you keep making? It's not a flattering one for Bitcoin. After eight years roughly [11%]( of the world and over [50%]( of America had internet access. Bitcoin has, what, 0.5% penetration in America, and a tiny fraction of that worldwide? 
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:39:24
I thought the point was to use Bitcoin as money. Seems to me that Bitcoin was wholly irrelevant to this transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:31:25
Oh wow you were serious? That's sad
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:37:36
I think you spelled "obvious bubble" wrong
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:05:36


*I'm* not at risk. In the event my card gets stolen or compromised, the charges get reversed immediately and any lost funds get reimbursed. CC protections are pretty great, actually.


True, but no-fee Credit Cards are not hard to find, and they still offer all the same protections and benefits. I've never paid a fee on any card in my life, but choosing to do so in exchange for better benefits is a totally legitimate decision which many people make. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:57:38
I love how bitcoin markets are so absurdly volatile that you don't even care until it hits 10%
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:54:02
No. Surcharges *were* illegal for many years and are now legal nationwide [as of January 2013.]( Offering cash discounts has always been legal to my knowledge, and Dodd-Frank explicitly prohibits credit card issuers from prohibiting merchants from offering cash discounts. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 00:29:14
It's not generally accepted for goods and services.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:33:51


Its lost 10% of value in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:38:37
Is it possible for you to be more unhelpful?
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:29:56


Basically nobody actually uses Bitcoin now. What makes you think that will change?


See above.


This hasn't been true in over a year. And also cuts against your own argument that use will grow. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:07:28


Putting all your money into bitcoin is crazy.

So in reality, OP paid a third party company some Bitcoin so they could buy him a pencil from Amazon.

My bank lets me send international wires for free 
So I would argue it works a whole lot better 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:53:48
Sorry, but I believe OP was asking what you can do with *Bitcoin.*
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:37:02


Just think - what if we got *2%*? Then it would be worth twice as much!
Of course, 2% is no more likely than 1% to happen, but it's fun to compare random percentages of things to other things. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:18:06


If by isolated scenarios you mean "the entirety of FDIC's existence" then yeah 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:46:34
Lol @ citing ZH as a reputable source.
 


Your bank account is fine.

How does a business "hold" it's "average annual spending"? What does that even mean? Something tells me you shouldn't be giving financial advice. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:01:20


FYI, nobody thinks this. HTH
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:45:30


Because the majority of those holding bitcoin do so at a loss, and they believe making grandiose claims will attract new investors and pump up the price. A few nutjobs probably do genuinely believe bitcoin will replace fiat currencies, but as you noted, there's zero indication that will ever occur.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:54:45


Then why does basically nobody use it as money 
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:03:18
Gold is a shit currency, which explains why nobody on earth uses it as one anymore.

Feel free to cite your sources anytime. Real tired of the crypto community thinking they can unilaterally redefine terms they don't like. Y'all are the SovCits of finance.

The SEC is going to have a field day when they hear about this.

Fair enough, at least you're consistent. Lots of people in here would say his opinion is worth far less because he's against bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:07:03


lol take off the tinfoil hat, bud
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:53:39
I downvoted you for your original statement, not your edit.  $10k is a ton of money for most people, and if your idea of a salary at a "good job" begins at six figures then you are very out of touch with what average people make.

I don't see how you can plausibly claim Bitcoin is "just as convenient" as any of those services, which are all widely accepted, contain numerous consumer protections, and were designed from the ground up to make the end user experience as seamless as possible. They're also all free to use and instant, so not sure what you mean by "fees or delays".
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:12:25


Assuming it ever becomes globally accepted, and that's a huge assumption.  As of now, there is no reason to expect Bitcoin to be anything more than a niche ~~investment vehicle~~ currency.
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:35:26
Thanks for further validating my point. A "store of value" should not be wildly volatile.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:46:23


What is being asked to file taxes unreasonable? What is being seized?


Lol that is absolutely not what that means.

Oh my god the broconomics in your post are astoundingly bad.


Agreed, we should go back to the good 'ol days when cyclical market crashes decimated our economy.  I sure do miss the Great Depression, don't you?


Yes, they would, because (1) it's predictable and stable, (2) easily manipulated via the central bank, and (3) moderate inflation is *good* for our economy.


I'm not even going to touch this one.  If you honestly don't understand how a fiat currency works, you are too far gone to help.


@_date: 2018-12-16 01:11:48
Yes. This happens constantly. There's also the question of the roughly ~20-30% of coins which are assumed to be Satoshi Nakomoto's, and which haven't moved in years and are presumed lost. That's also why market cap is a useless metric for cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:09:21


/s? Surely someone can't actually be this financially illiterate 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:34:29
Not to mention the non-chalantness by which OP throws around ~$700bn.  If Bitcoin was a country, it would be the 19th largest GDP in the world.
