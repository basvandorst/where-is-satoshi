That’s my fear. Losing my mind and forgetting where I put my hardware wallet keys.

Can anyone recommend a good iOS app wallet to start buying bitcoin that accepts credit card? thanks

I'm also thinking about buying from Amazon (so I can get it sooner).  When you did your validation, does it come with instructions on how to do the validations and was it easy to do? thanks.

I like the GDAX.com interface better than Coinbase, but also like to check my account and trade using my mobile.  Does GDAX have their own iOS app or am I limited to using a desktop?

Great intro info for noobs like me.
Does bitcoin price continuously change/trade at all times? (unlike US stock market which has set pre-market, market and extended trading times)

Other than actually owning bitcoin, what advantages would buying bitcoin be compared to purchasing shares of GBTC on the stock market? (for investment purposes, not for using btc to purchase goods)

Thanks for the answer. How can one buy BTC with your traditional IRA?

I would like to know this as well.  How do you report to the IRS capital gains?  I assume this is just like stocks where you would only report gains if you sold bitcoin.

Thanks for the info about your hardware wallet.  I know it is used primarily for long-term holding, but have a question regarding how easy (and quickly) it is to get your btc from your hardware wallet to trade/sell, should the need arises.  For example, lets say that there was an opportunity to sell after a big pop (or drop) in price.  How easy would it be to go online and dump btc quickly? (lets say that you did not carry the hard wallet with you as well).  Along the same lines, let's say you wanted to move a portion of your holdings from the hard wallet to an exchange to do some trading...is this easy to do?

I’m convinced Satoshi is a time traveler living in the future. That is why no one can find him! :)

You can tell her that the difference between BCH and BTC is basically missing an IT and IH, respectively....just like her.
