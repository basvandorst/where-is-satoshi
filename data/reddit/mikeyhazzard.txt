Did anyone else wonder why the video wouldn't play, then realize it's a screenshot and feel stupid???

A lot of people think bitcoin is going to crash because of the tech.  Awesome teams are out there everywhere working on improving the blockchain that is going to take it to another universe.  (I believe we're past the moon already)  ;)

You need to take into account what the stock split history has been since then...
06/08/1971 2 for 1
06/02/1983 2 for 1
05/26/1987 2 for 1 
05/16/1994 2 for 1 
05/12/1997 2 for 1 
05/08/2000 3 for 1 
02/26/2019 104 for 100 
So, for the sake of ease, if the stock was $10 and you owned 100 of them back before 1971 (totalling $1000 equity) and if the price stayed exactly the same throughout the years, today you would have a total of $98,840... almost 100x your original investment.  Not bad...

I heard the Tsing Tao recipe is the original Heineken recipe and was sold to Tsing Tao when they modified the recipe.  As to the validity of these allegations, I am unsure.

I mean I was originally set for a long position, which is still open.  I guess it isn't terrible if you want to go for longer trades.  I was just highly attracted to the 5x margin levels.

Back in 2011 I was telling all of my friends and family to invest.  I transferred all of my money from my brokerage account to invest.  
2 months ago my parents started going through a terrible divorce.  Bought my mom a house and a new car.  Asked where I got the money.  Asked her if she remembered me praising btc for so long.  She did.  Showed her my btc wallet.  She cried.

Stop looking at the dollar value.  It's common for altcoins to fluctuate 5% or much more in a day.  $400 isn't much money for what it's valued at.

It doesn't seem to me like she has done her due diligence regarding the baseline for how people are investing in these "virtual currencies".  However, it seems she is referring to the different ira options (for retirement investments) that are tax exempt as long as you hold until retirement age.  
  She is fighting for the incredibly small number of people who actually plan to hold until retirement but isn't focusing on the whole picture here.  She asked important questions but obviously doesn't fully understand that the American SEC isn't able to protect everyone's investments from fraudsters in this realm of investing.  She is worried about the scam ICOs defrauding investors and walking away without the ability for the investors to hold these scammers accountable.  The fact that when these things happen, the people who lose their monies will never see a penny of their losses again.  This is an absolute tragedy.  Whereas when one invests in IPOs, the companies invested in are always held accountable in the states.  
  Scam IPOs are almost entirely unheard of today because of how heavily this asset class regulated.  Her heart is in the right place.  However, she doenst fully understand the decentralization factor that is the very essence of blockchain tech and the impossibility to guarantee a 100% scam free market.

I never said anything about settling.  I was referring to transferring the money from settlements to an account that can be used to buy into cryptocurrencies like Kraken or Coinbase.  
This is most often done through ETFs which can take over a week sometimes for the money to transfer.

There are many uneducated investors out there, and adding absolute "protections" (which I believe is what she wants), in theory, would eliminate the need to hold the uneducated investor accountable for getting scammed.  Obviously I agree with you.  Everyone should always do their due diligence.  I'm just playing devil's advocate.  ;)

If 10% of all money from the shares that have been sold went into crypto in the last week, then no.  The demand for crypto would have jumped significantly too high to account for the drop in price over the last week.  Also it usually takes a 3 day minimum for money from sold stocks to hit bank accounts.  
This is totally irrational.  But trolls will troll.

I have one.  Copy and paste the correct address; or if typing, make sure to triple-check the address to make sure it's correct.  
What I'm curious about is whether or not OP sent the money to a real address or off into the abyss with the rest of the lost BTC...

You realize that almost all Mexicans that come across the border DON'T sell drugs?  That is a racist idea.  There is a much higher percentage of legal citizens that sell drugs than illegal citizens that sell drugs.  And before you twist those numbers, I mean if you took 1000 legal citizens there would be more drug dealers in that group than there would be among 1000 illegal citizens..
