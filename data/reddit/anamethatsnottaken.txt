Yes, I would. If you're trying to store the seed for several years, these are all bad options. I mistakenly thought the question was about storing the seed.
If you want an offline way to generate addresses from your seed, an old phone is a great solution imo.

So it was actually 2 transactions (one to the new address, and one from that to you)? Was the previous one also non-batched (1-input-2-output)?

[PoW] Short block time means high uncle rate, which is wasted hashing power. This gives a greater advantage to being close to the big miner(s), relative to a long average block time.
That's an advantage to the big mining farm and a disadvantage to a mining pool.
As for security, given the same hash rate block time doesn't change the security, just the confirmation count needed to get there - 1 hour of blocks on a short block time is the same hashing power as 1 hour of blocks on a long block time.

Electrum doesn't generate a BIP39 seed, but is willing to import one (while complaining!).
I love Electrum but I dislike this decision. Maybe their seed method is better, but BIP39 is a widely-used standard with many useful tools (like the above-mentioned seed-and-address generator)

a) Yeah, that's a bad route for sending bitcoins to customers, which they do quickly? But the consolidating transactions can be mined later. If they don't advertise their transaction (only give it to a miner friend who doesn't forward it) there's no risk of someone else mining it
b) True. You could theorize about how long-term it leads to others paying high fees which they do get to collect
c) Yeah, they'd be less profitable than a regular miner who actually gets the fees instead of paying them to himself, but they still get the block reward which is much larger than the fee reward, even when fees were near all-time-high
The only reason I'm giving this theory any shred of credence is a transaction I saw the other day (which I was told was Coinbase's), where the change consolidation happening later sent 83% of the value to the fee

It costs 0.08 of that coin to fill up its block completely (per-block), making the miners choose the higher txs to mine (i.e. enabling the 'unsafe' RBF), making 0-conf insecure
0-conf is only secure (as secure as the chain, which gets less hash power of the same PoW as the BTC chain) if you're moving small amounts and the blocks are empty. Once one of those is false, 0-conf is insecure

At first, yes. People selling USDT have nothing to sell it for except crypto. But people trying to exit will find a path to USD and the price will go down.
That first phase will be fast - USDT is worth 1$, or something near 0 (how likely is it that it's not backed 1:1, but *is* backed 9:10?). If people are selling USDT because they think it's worth 0, soon there are no buyers.

Ledger can be used with Electrum, which allows setting the server, which can be co-located with the full node.
If you're using Lightning with small amounts, the third-party risk might be small enough for you. It can be used securely with a pruning node, which requires a few GBs of storage (currently 3.4GB for chainstate and at least 550MB for pruned blockchain mode).
I think it can be much smaller - monitoring channels doesn't require validating the chain. All you need from a Lightning-enabling monitoring node is to alert you if a relevant transaction is visible on the blockchain (and to publish the punishing transaction, if needed). That should only require a few MBs of storage and RAM.

You can convert a Bitcoin Core full node into the "third party" you're using to validate. There should be multiple ways, but one I know is to deploy ElectrumX and use Electrum client
Found a quote on that in the first result for 'trezor server':
"I run a Trezor off a bitcoin node that runs in my house.  The Trezor talks to an electrum 2.0 beta client and the electrum 2.0 beta client talks to an electrum server which talks to the bitcoin node.  The electrum server and the bitcoin node are physically in my home office."

If your next transaction costs &gt;20 sat per byte, and a segwit input is 20% discount (don't recall how much it is, exactly), then if you can move now for &lt;5 sat per byte, it's a net gain overall.
If your next transaction is after scaling fixed the problem for good and it'll definitely cost &lt;=20 sat/byte, then you're surely not gaining anything from moving now.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:12:42
It wasn't the exact amount to pay you and the fees - there's a change, which is spent later.
The input for that was generated in the previous block, by consolidating 9 inputs all from the same address (deposits?). BTW, with much lower fee.
Some of the consolidation later is with a high fee.
[How to consolidate 8 UTXOs into a miner fee](
The change is split into two outputs. Each is then consolidated with other outputs of similar size, each consolidation into 2 outputs. In one, most of the value (84%) went to the fee. In another, 38%.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:35:19
Moving it now is cheap (4 sat/byte are getting confirmed. If you use RBF you don't need to worry about it getting stuck). If you'll want to move it or open an LN channel when fees are high it'll cost you less then.

No. The default configuration for a full node is not to mine.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:30:02
The payment gateway makes money from paying high fees?
And how does avoiding segwit help with this? If someone posts a transaction with a fee of 2000 sat/byte, that's how much it'll pay regardless of segwit. If they want the transaction to be big (since the segwit input counts as fewer bytes) they can add more outputs or use more inputs or set the fee they pay even higher.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:51:55

I think I took issue with you saying 'many' 1.5MB blocks - 17/1000 is still pretty rare.

I recently read something about how ASIC mining is actually *good* for a cryptocurrency - there's nothing else you can do with that ASIC.
Currencies which are mined with GPUs can be attacked with hardware that's currently being used for other things (like running simulations of nuclear weapons, for example :)). There's nothing to do with an ASIC miner but mine so you're likely to know what the current potential mining power is - it equals the visible mining power.
Litecoin does have ASIC mining now, though?

What's your definition of '1MB' and 'rare'?
I took a look at the last 100 blocks:
    
         for hash in `for i in {506476..506576}; do bitcoin-cli getblockhash $i; done`; do
            bitcoin-cli getblock $hash | grep size;
         done
        
It looks like:
    
        "strippedsize": 957049,
        "size": 1121540,
        "strippedsize": 948560,

        "strippedsize": 983241,
        "size": 1043431,
        "strippedsize": 970653,
        "size": 1081237,
There's one block over 1500000
Sort by size
         | grep -e '"size' | gawk '{print $2}' | sort -n
You get:

Those are the largest blocks from the last 100

Right now (past 6 hours), 157 sat/byte is not a very high fee.

@_date: 2018-01-28 23:45:11
That is correct. Their sizes were: 999394,
These (at the least, the last 6 ones) are accidents - inefficient miners (or mining pools) that mine a near-empty block right after one was found.
Did you mean to say &lt;1MB are rare? That is absolutely correct. It has been for a while now, since there's always unconfirmed transactions to gather. It provides a stable income for miners (except the block reward, of course :)). A miner can look at the mempool and see that his next block will provide at least 0.1BTC of fees (0.6 right now, according to my reading of Johoe's mempool graph)

It is rare to find hardware that's resilient to an attacker with physical access. Notable exceptions are encryption where the hardware forgets the key (properly - not all hardware does the forgetting bit as well as you might hope), but that's only as strong as the key (which you need to memorize?). And some hardware tricks like TPM uses. Are you storing enough for an attacker to afford an electron microscope?
The article is an example of hardware doing it wrong - the PIN-locking was supposed to be impervious to a physical attacker (at least one not equipped with an electron microscope).

Sharding is splitting the network into, well, shards. Somewhat akin to forking many times at once, but maintaining a single coin (so every node needs to be aware of all the shards to validate transactions on the shard it's mining on).

1. It's not. Depending on your definition of "safe", it's not even safe to spend after one confirmation.
2. If a block contains an invalid transaction, it is not a valid block and so it is not in the blockchain, as far as every other (well-behaved) node is concerned. The node in your question would be hard-forking into a chain that only it is following.
3. Yes. It is also possible that I will get hit by a meteor while being hit by lightning in the middle of summer. I think the key collision is slightly less probable. OTOH, if the randomness generator used by the wallets suck, it can become a lot more probable (see Debian's OpenSSH bug)

To be fair, they're all technical debt at this point. The amount of crap we pile on top of HTTP to make it do things it was never meant to. TCP, too, both has tons of added-on stuff because it's always way easier than replacing it. And was not designed for intermittent traffic and silence like we use it for in many cases today (which is one of the reasons why FTP uses one TCP connection for control and seperate connections for the data transfer). QUIC is (slowly) replacing it.
As hard as replacing basic Internet infrastructure is, replacing a base layer that has real world currency value attached to it is much harder - just upgrading software is not enough.
So we'll keep improving Bitcoin until, 30 years from now, developers will be whining about how horrible all these layers of hacks are and how great it would be if it was designed The Right Way from the start, or if they could tear it down and rebuild it.

Neither. Relaying rules are not soft-fork or hard-fork rules, as they don't affect whether a block is considered valid or not. If you send your tx directly to a miner, those rules are not in effect (because the tx does not require relaying - you send it, he receives it and mines it, if he wants to)
Nodes can set the configuration parameter for minimum relay fee and it does not cause a soft fork.

BIP39 doesn't feel in infancy (unlike, say, bech32 :)), not that Electrum is the only deterministic wallet that doesn't use BIP39 for. Electrum supports recovering a BIP39 seed, but warns that it might not always be supported.

You don't need that much - the blocks are happy to stay on HDD.

1. Counterparty posts an old state, where you had less coins than in the newest state. You're offline and don't notice for X hours (X is determined by the channel state - both sides agree on it in advance).
2. You try and steal counterparty's coins, they publish a breach remedy tx and take your coins as well.
3. You lose the keys, including those to the channel's output, so regardless of how it is closed you cannot spend your output. You also cannot sign a new state so the channel must be closed. There's multiple subsets of which keys you can lose, but they're all derived from a master key so it's unlikely that you lose only a subset.
You can also forget you have a channel (lose the channel state) so when it closes you don't know. If you still remember that you used to have coins on-chain you can follow them to find the channel. I guess you can also get hit by a bus, in which case you might be considered as having lost your coins.

You're describing a payment channel. Lightning Network is constructing a network of payment channels.

In that case the ratio (outputs per transaction) will go up. That's the first thing I see when I go to outputs.today

When people say 'wallet', they often refer to deterministic wallets, which generate multiple addresses, or just plain collections of addresses (your wallet.dat file, before HD, contained a bunch of private keys, or addresses, or 'wallets')
If you don't reuse addresses, then there can be no two transactions sent from the same address - you spend all (1) outputs to that address when you spend from it. That's slightly stronger anonymity, but it still breaks often (f.e. whoever gave you your coins might know all the addresses you received coins from them in)
If you receive 0.2BTC in one tx and then 0.4BTC in another, and then spend 0.1BTC, it is possible to see which of the two outputs were spent.
You can send BTC to a 'wrong' address for which no one knows the private key - it was not lost if no one had it to begin with. The chances of randomly typing a wrong but valid address is small, and with bech32 it is minuscule.

The spread (difference between sell price and buy price) is generally low in high-liquidity markets. Keeping it low, by posting maker orders which narrow the spread, can be profitable (your buy orders are below your sell orders, and maker order has zero fee), so there are bots which do this. This is done on many markets, not just cryptocurrency markets.
If you see people buying and selling (person A buys and then B sells, or vice versa), someone just made a tiny amount of profit by providing liquidity

Yes, it's more likely at the lower rates, but not necessarily. Think of it this way: Look at the top 17% paying transactions, the ones that are usually overpaying by a large margin. If they're a steady stream (and if the last block was 17% full of them, that's very likely) then, if an hour goes by without a block, the next block will be filled entirely of those.
Tracking the bottom 5% can get you a fee that's very likely to reach the next block. Tracking the top 17% will get you a fee that's almost guaranteed to reach the next block. The difference between them will be very large.
Of course, not reaching the next block in these rare circumstances might be OK. You're still likely to reach the blockchain in the hour or two after the block gap.

The 12-word seed is slightly less than 128 bits - there's 132 bits in the 12 words, but then it does a nonce-like walk until it gets a correct checksum (8 bits using HMAC), so you get 132-8=124 bits
That's a chance of 4.70e-38 or, given than there's 100,000 seeds out there, 4.7e-33
(The segwit seed must match 12 bits of checksum)

To elaborate, I believe this is a reference to: [Reflections on Trusting Trust](
"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code."
Using a compiler built from source is not secure, if it was built using a binary compiler that was backdoored to produce a compiler which, when compiling bitcoind's source code, injects a backdoor into it :D

Only if there's somewhere you can reasonably pump from. A reasonably-sized AC in a reasonably-insulated house can create a temperature differential of, what, 20 degrees celsius? 30? That might not be enough for some places. But those probably use natural gas for heating, no?

IIUC, to agree on a new state (and invalidate the old one), it must have a new secret. If it had a similar secret (only difference is a counter) then whatever invalidates the old can invalidate the new.
I saw somewhere else here that you only need 100 bytes per state and that the breach-remedy transaction is computed. I need to read more about this (and actually watch the linked video :))

Then those large institutions would get to decide what Bitcoin is (which chain they follow and due to what rules)
You'd need to trust these legal entities to tell you which transactions are valid and which UTXOs have what balance

If you use a secure compiler (and system) to compile gcc, and then use that to compile gcc (known as bootstrapping the compiler), the result should be the same (as when a binary gcc compiles it). If it is, there was no backdoor. This has been done (by other compilers' developers), so we can conclude that their copy of gcc was not compromised. Only your copy is :D
Simply using two compilers to compile one another is not enough, as the paper states. But if you write a simple compiler and can bootstrap them, it's trusted (unless the backdoor is deeper in the system). At some point the attack needed to make it all compromised without showing any evidence becomes too hard to be reasonable

When miners see/find a new block, they immediately try to find the next block. Constructing the block's contents (gathering transactions) takes a little while (I don't know how long - a few seconds?) So at first they have nothing to work on but an empty block. More efficient than waiting to gather transactions first.

It happens every day, naturally. There's a steady flow of 140 sat/b transactions. If a block isn't found in an hour, the next block will be filled with them.
For an example from today, look at blocks 508507-508508 - if you ignore the 5 cheapest transactions, the minimum fees jumped about 10x (if you don't, they only jumped 2x). Both blocks were full
Another example from the last 24h would be blocks 508524/5 - also about 10x increase (even if you don't ignore the cheapest txs). And that was with a 20-minute gap between blocks.
I think you can account for the time dimension and get a very good model for how fees behave, but how do you decide what fee to broadcast? You either need to guess when the next block is coming, which will make you underpay if you're wrong, or assume the worst and overpay by 10x

Exactly. For sales tax, this is no different than if you were paying in cash. Same for income tax, if you were getting your income in cash instead of direct deposit. And same for capital gains - I get capital gains taxes deducted by the bank and broker. I only need to file taxes if I'm owed a refund.

CPU,RAM-wise, it's way enough. Mine is much weaker and its load is very low.
I'd recommend a small SSD for the chainstate, though - pretty much all the IOs go there (it has ~16x more writes than the HDD which holds the blocks). Before I moved the chainstate to SSD, there was constant churning noises, even after it finished syncing.

When block reward will be significantly reduced, there will be plenty of lightning channel opening and closing transactions for the miners to mine.
Also, big payments will probably always be on-chain, as maintaining a large amount of funds in a lightning node is risky.
To rephrase the above, there will always be funds moving in and out of cold wallets.

If the wallet can send funds, that means it can sign transactions, and is connected to the Internet (to talk to the channel peers). Isn't that what a hot wallet is?
Just like the wallets many people use today. If the device has access to the private keys and is connected to the Internet, it is a hot wallet. Granted, mobile devices are pretty secure (a malicious app that wasn't explicitly granted root/device-admin privileges won't be able to access the wallet app that's running on the same device)

That sounds right. I was going to say that if you're given transactions signed by the watchee, then you have to be trusted not to publish them. But you're correct - you'll be given signed transactions that are only valid if the counterparty publishes a fraudulent state. They're invalid until then (they spend non-existing outputs) so there's no risk.
You have to store one for each possible fraudulent state - for each commitment transaction that the watchee gave the counterparty, which the counterparty can sign and publish, there's a fraud-sweep one (the secret which allows it is different for each state). You can't just store the secrets, like an LN node would, because you don't have the signing key.
This will be cheap at first but as scale grows storing all the channels' states will get pretty big.
A watching-only watcher can store only the txids to watch for (or even just a short hash) and notify the watchee if foul play is taking place, but it requires the watchee to be somewhat responsive.

I seem to recall Andreas describing it as easy as a multicurrency wallet, implying that paying on LN or paying on the chain are different, at least in the lower layer, as moving funds from one to another requires a 'conversion' transaction. (BTW, you can close a channel directly to someone on-chain that you're paying to).
Then again I also heard him say you'll scan an invoice and your wallet will pay it without you having to know how.
You could set up trustless a LN-to-BTC gateway, using the same scripts as atomic swaps. But that requires the recipient to participate (as if you send an atomic swap to him - he'll need to accept a hash preimage to take the funds), or multiple transactions (in which case you might as well close a channel to pay and open a new one).
There are blockchains that don't exhibit this property - Monero has a ledger of all transactions, right? But you can't check an address and see how much there is in it.
I think the blockchain's basic property is not storing transactions or proving the absence of them, but allowing to verify that a transaction is valid and confirming it. The blockchain verifies LN's opening and closing transactions, and inside the channel both peers agree on every state update. The only shady thing you can do inside the channel, that your peer will agree to, is to claim to have less funds than you do.

With watching services (watching a channel requires 100 bytes per state, and a full node. Not all 100 bytes need to be in RAM - just the txid to watch for), it's pretty much guaranteed that cheating on a channel (by broadcasting the wrong closing transaction) will result in losing your funds in favor of your counterparty. That makes it as immutable as the chain.

If both parties to a channel are 'colluding to cheat', they don't need to open a payment channel and can't do anything the layer 1 blockchain won't allow them to do anyway.
If one party is trying to cheat inside the channel, the other party can always close the channel on the last valid state (the channel isn't opened until there is an initial valid state), so their funds are never locked up for long.
Cheating by broadcasting the wrong state to the blockchain leads to loss of all your funds for that channel (they'll be swept by your counterparty). Misbehaving inside the channel will result in the counterparty closing it, and you get 'refunded' whatever you had before in the last valid state.

I agree, though that feels optimistic - whose to say Bitcoin will directly move 5% of the transactions? Maybe it'll only be 0.5%


I don't think anyone knows what the fee market will look like then. When the block reward goes close to 0, maybe the fees per block will be half a bitcoin. Maybe they'll be 50 bitcoins.

If nodes reject it outright, it's not even unconfirmed - you can send a different one and it won't be considered a double-spend because there is no conflicting transaction to conflict with.

What happens if you have a samsung hard drive but you're used to accessing your files by going to samsung.com? The hardware is there in your hand but the default software people are using with hardware wallets often connects to the vendor's server (for validating, broadcasting transactions, or sometimes just plain runs off it).
There's 3rd party software that can utilize the hardware wallet. One should make sure it works beforehand.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:10:45
OK, so a double spend in LN is when you close the channel using an old state where you had more funds than the current state. The answer to your question is the counterparty's ability to publish a breach remedy transaction and sweep the entire channel output to themselves. It's not perfect, but it might work

I haven't seen the term 'forger' before, in this context. In Proof-of-Stake, a staker is chosen. How you choose a staker changes from system to system (randomly is preferable, weighted by how much they stake). Instead of solving a PoW, the staker just signs a block with his private key.

Information theory is, as a field, about 60 years old. In that time we've learned that humans are terrible at randomness - at deciding if something is random or not, and at doing anything at random - picking numbers, letters, words, even waving arms.
What this means is that if an adversary is trying to brute-force your seed and knows (or guesses) that you picked it by waving your finger over a wordlist, there's a good chance they can exploit the weaknesses in human 'randomness' to narrow down the search, possibly by enough orders of magnitude as to make a brute-force search feasible.
I really like the idea of using dice as it is a stronger source of randomness than most computers' (which use weak sources of randomness to seed a PRNG)
