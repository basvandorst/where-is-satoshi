You got any of those bitcorns
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:54:56
I get the joke, but really if everyone is counting on the scarcity of bitcoin for value, aren't we creating a new 1% class? Since there is no inflation, how does this not create a dynasty of haves and haves note for the future?
@_date: 2019-07-03 14:41:40
While I bet what you are saying, my issue is that with no inflation a family with 1000 bitcoin will have the same enormous economic disparity it already has.
I'm thinking about a 1900's robber baron who had 10 million dollars net worth which was insanely rich over time. If that family did nothing, they would not be nearly as rich these days, but with bitcoin, they'd have the same or more purchasing power now, for doing nothing for society.
I get that money begats money, and likely they would not be stagnant, but you get what I mean. And I know the current system is fucked as well. I think as long as this planet has finite resources there will always be those more efficient in the system (the haves, 1 percenters, etc) and the have nots (poor, less starting advantage, geographic location etc)

@_date: 2019-07-02 21:07:42
It seems so, and those with 1,000's of coins, won't they weild more power than some countries if it plays out that way? That's my only thing about crypto that bothers me.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:51:14

You are the very picture of the "snowflake" insult. Of all the things to complain about, you take the retarded stand on the word retarded being used in a way that is insulting. In what world is retard, being a retard, or acting retarded a positive thing? 
If more people would choose not to be offended by every little thing on their life, maybe the world would be a much better place. 
We are going to need a "words to not use in order to not harm feelings, even when it's intended" list.
So stop being so slow, fag.

You retard. So you basically are using a picture of a ruined scam artist, like you are some bad ass maverick, declaring Yolo and hoping other bag holders also don't sell their bags. Bravo

It also drives power costs up for other folks who cannot afford solar/cant get it.
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:03:45
Power companies are basically coops where government and the companies set prices (with some profit) based on usage and demand . Part of prices are for upgrades and maintainance. When less and less people use it, the cost don't scale down perfectly so the people who are left shoulder more
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:24:40
Isnt the fed there to do such things? In an economic cycle, the fed serves to cushion the fall.

@_date: 2019-01-12 21:07:47
Bitcoin doesnt get to play by  the same rules as the dollar does. Currency is only worth what people place value in, and right now, the general public trusts the dollar more than bitcoin.
Think to yourself, do you still check the price on bitcoin in the amount of dollars that it's worth? The public does. Any time mainstream news reports on bitcoin its "how many dollars" that its up to.

Does it bother anyone that bitcoin value is going to be driven by institutions? Is Bitcoin ever going to be used primarily what its meant for, ie, buying "stuff" and not an investment vehicle?
