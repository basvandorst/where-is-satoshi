Okay so if lost coins are effectively gone forever, should they count towards the total market value of Bitcoin? Right now, the major "market capitalization" outlets for cryptocurrencies report "market capitalizations" that include all the BTC that have ever been mined X current price... if it's the case these coins are gone forever, BTC is even scarcer and should there have a higher unit value --&gt; unless the market is already pricing this in?

Interestingly, the article since it was first published has been updated quite a bit though most of the updates appear to be related to grammar and style... that said, the reference to PayPal has been completely removed. I'm surprised the whole article hasn't been taken down... anyone know what the typical level of post-publication revision activity is?
Some examples:
* 8/15: &gt; They exist only in the cloud, like Paypal.
* 8/16: &gt; ~~They exist only in the cloud, like Paypal.~~
* 8/15: &gt; Inherently, being virtual is not a bad thing
* 8/16: &gt; Being virtual is not inherently a bad thing
* 8/15: &gt; much greater than one could ever get for the tulips once planted **and it flowered**.
* 8/16: &gt; much greater than one could ever get for the tulips once planted **and flowered**.
* 8/15: &gt; They are an **on-line** currency which can be used to buy things
* 8/16: &gt; They are an **online** currency which can be used to buy things

You could also try one of the round-up apps for this (e.g., coinseed.co, pocketbloom.com, etc.). Depending on your spending patterns, you could generate round-up purchases a few times per week... not exactly DCA, but similar....

How did you arrive at a particular DCA amount?
Thoughts on those "round-up" style apps? (e.g., coinseed.co, pocketbloom.com, etc.)?

If the value of Bitcoin is proportional to transaction volumes, it seems like a "buy one, give one" approach would increase the price of Bitcoin while also helping non-profits. What do you guys think?

Agree for now... and I also agree w/ the gist of:
That said, it's possible that some *unsophisticated* existing high net worth clients of theirs will be asking for crypto exposure in the future... why anyone would try getting market access through these firms makes no sense... that said, it doesn't seem unreasonable that it'll go from being a topic of conversation w/ these clients (who don't know coinbase, etc. exist) to being a request. What will the bulge brackets do then? Not saying they'll start their own crypto funds just yet, but I'm guessing they might start dealing w/ the coins directly at some point...

Related to that, to what extent are there incentives to shred existing coins?

And now the Fed has just a hundred some odd basis points at its disposal going into whenever the next recession hits...
