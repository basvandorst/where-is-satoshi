....we are in q4, though...
[According to this Coindesk slideshare]( Q3 2014 saw $60million raised from VC funding.
So I divide that 284 by 2 and thats 142. So thats Total Q1/Q2 2014?
Then + the $60 million Q3, gives us $202 million total thru Q3?
Then [Blockchain added series A and that was a Q4 deal so add another $30.5 million]( then, [Bitfury added $20m a few days later, along with SolidX's $3m](
So if my calculations are correct, **we've actually already passed that 1995 figure...**

Yes, this true. I should say something like 'anti-banking establishment'. 
Personally, I don't see it as possible to change something that isn't seen as a problem; so, their has to be an 'enemy' of some sort.
I also see 'government' as a different animal, especially in the case of the US. One that you can't chuck rocks at from the outside and expect it to change. Additionally, it's next to impossible to get into a position to change without putting an R or D next to your name, either. So your second point is one I'm not inclined to completely agree with.
Even so, while this may look great to a few of us, the average 50 yr old white male Republican (the Average Texas Republican Primary voter) will give 2 shits about one of the candidates accepting BTC. And in his Senate election, the primary can pretty much be considered the general election. Whoever wins it is a shoe-in.

No, it is a card; It ONLY works at ATMs. I cannot use it at, say, a restaraunt or retail store. 
Most ATMs in the USA are operated by banks who charge a fee to use them if you are not a account holder at their bank. 
Some of the larger banks, refund these fees that their account holders might incur when withdrawing cash from an ATM operated by their bank.
My credit union (credit unions are similar to a bank but different in some key areas) is small &amp; local, and there are few ATMs operated by them. They do not refund these fees.

The article needs to separate the words bitcoin and blockchain. 
A bank could arguably pretty easily institute a decentralized ledger of transactions and incorporate participation in this confirmation network it into the account login process. 
That is, if they had any profit potential for doing so. If not, why do it? Maybe a credit union would go for this, but I have doubts about a commercial bank needing/wanting this idea.

Actually, something similar to this has been my latest pet project. I have only thought about it in the context of the USA, though, where I am from.
My project is a zero-trust voting system based on blockchain technology.
The idea is that in a similar fashion to bitcoin, each registered voter is issued a "public" and private key. Candidates would get "exclusive" keys (as well as a exclusive key for write-in candidates) to which voters would direct their vote to using the private key they were issued.
Voting could take place remotely in theory, but I'm troubled by a risk of voter fraud and believe there would be a formidable opposition to implementing such a system, so for my project I have required that voting still take place in person using your private key. 
The "public" key, would serve as unit of transparency in the tabulation and verification of votes, with the "blockchain" of votes becoming public domain after polls closed. This would be able to be accessed by anyone to verify that their own vote went to the correct candidate by searching their "public" key. This would be a non-identifiable string similar to a bitcoin address. 
In, the US, we have had our trouble with electronic voting, and there are some fervent Ron Paul and previous to that Al Gore supporters who make a strong case that they were both failed by said system.
It's my opinion the transparency that this system would provide would be an excellent weapon against voter fraud while similarly maintaining privacy of the individual.
Additionally, it would allow the every day arm chair politician a certain degree of ability to compare/contrast population demographics (census data) with voting results, which is a model that several lobbying firms on E-Street and other polling organizations have built their business on.
Admittedly, this could have multiple effects on that industry. It could stimulate it, allowing these firms to focus more of their resources and refine the pool of which politicians they lobby. On the other hand, individuals and citizen groups would have access to the same information, which allows them that same power, indirectly weakening the power of these lobbying firms.
Overall, though, I believe the implications such a system might have on transparency in the election cycle to be paramount to this minor concern.
I wont go too much more into it, but if you would like to spitball ideas about it with me, anyone is free to PM me about it. I'm looking for input! :)

unSystem has been pretty open about their distaste for the regulation-happy side of the bitcoin community that just wants to see wider adoption at all costs. 
It has nothing to do with pride, they are just political &amp; idealistic. Where one contingent of people just wants a safe place to shop with bitcoin or are trying to get rich, Amir &amp; unSystem are choosing to draw a line in the sand and are staying true to what was once the standard political connotations associated with bitcoin.
