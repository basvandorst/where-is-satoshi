This will be the new “10,000 bitcoin for 2 pizzas” story.

Bitcoin cash is definitely one of the alts I was referring to. Though I think it’s more commonly known as bcash

It hard to take the SEC seriously when it can't even afford to stay open.

Hodl the lines, stay together, if you find yourself alone hodling in the fields of endless selling, do not be troubled, for you are soon to be on the moon, and you are already BTC rich. 
Brothers, what we do In times of FUD, echoes in your soon to be new life of wealth. 
On my signal, let go of fear and trust this damn revolutionary technology. This is one of the all time greats.

At what price is Bitcoin considered to have gone super saiyan?

I am not advocating dodging taxes. I am advocating being your own bank. Pay your taxes, bad things happen to people who don’t.

Smartphones put the previous generation’s supercomputers in our pockets. 
Bitcoin puts the previous generation’s Swiss banks accounts in our pockets.

Bitcoin was not the equivalent of the winning lottery ticket back when these people say they had them. It could have been a losing ticket. There was no way to know for sure

They are shills.

Then, you will learn what it’s like to HODL.

Denied this ETF, but delayed another to September.... 
Why delay one when you could deny them all at the same time? Why make the point of saying this has nothing to do with bitcoin and blockchain, and everything to do with low volume futures market manipulation risks? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:53:08
If Satoshi can HODL through gut wrenching  lows, then damn it, so can we.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:06:18
Since bitcoin’s daily volume is around 4 billion, 825 million for a whole year is nothing.

I think we can agree that the WSJ article is biased. But wasn’t it also informative? People now have more information about the Bitcoin situation.
The guys at the WSJ are our Messengers. They go out into the world, collect raw information, package, and deliver it to us. 
BUT, what we don’t acknowledge - or worse - don’t understand - is that these Messengers manipulate the information (change the code). They don’t write in their own lies, but they do deliberately omit information (they omit code - usually very important code).
Can we accept that this manipulation is the same as lying? it certainly has the same effect on the reader.

I was under the impression that ViaBTC (aka Bitmain jr) was at the heart of the 2X movement. If they are saying things like this, then there is more here than meets the eye. I would be cautious.

Scammers use stolen money on venmo to purchase iphones from unsuspecting sellers, then venmo does the rest. The money is removed from the sellers account after a few hours, and the scammers walk away with free iPhones.

Can someone please explain? Apparently a BCASH hard fork is about to happen. I don’t think this directly affects BTC, but I’d like to know what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:53:31
To use a bitcoin metaphor: Be a self validating node. validate for yourself. Listen to your peers, then make up your own mind. The moment you elevate any individual to ‘god’ status is the moment you start propagating bad blocks to the network.

“I don’t trust nobody and nobody trusts me” - Clearly a reference to bitcoin’s trustless protocol.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:23:37
That line may also be in reference to checking the price on coinmarketcap but I’m not sure ;)

A JP Morgan executive taking a lead role in the SEC around the same time that many are hoping for SEC approved Bitcoin EFTs. Hopefully is not hostile toward cryptocurrency.

The hodl is not strong with this one.

If the big mining pools artificially protect it during November’s hard fork FUD campaign, 51% attacks will be very difficult.

No 20/20 hindsight needed. Buy. Hodl. And just get on with your life. You won’t be disappointed
