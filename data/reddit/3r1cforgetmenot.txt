I am truly sorry for your loss, very tragic ��
I had some of my savings into Bitcoin and I was able to get 0.2 BTC. I was so proud of "owning" even a portion of BTC!
Of course, I was too late to the game with regards to Bitcoin mining.
When I started getting more interested into it, I looked into getting an Antminer S9.
Electricity is pretty cheap here and I did the math. A single S9 could have been a good investment.
I tried finding an Antminer S9 locally, although there is a huge markup on those units and I didn't want to pay 2x the price.
Bitmain didn't have them in stock either.
Then I found a "retailer" online.
At this point you probably can see me coming, right?
Price was good, website seemed legit... I did not see all the redflags as I was so thrilled by the idea of finally getting one of those elusive Bitcoin miners.
It's always easy to say after the fact "oh, I should have..." I was tricked and now i'll never get my 0.1708 BTC back. This number shall remain printed in my mind forever.
I still kick myself everyday for having been tricked. I consider myself a bit tech savvy, i'm familiar with the fishing and scams. I guess the ego takes a big hit.
Oh well, I'll probably be downvoted on this as I probably deserve what happened.
That's only a portion of a Bitcoin you'll say, but I feel so depressed right now. And although I'm well aware that this was money "I could afford to lose", now was not the time as I am going through difficult times right now.
I am seeing it now as I know I am being more reclusive, I don't talk as much to family, don't return calls. No one knows what happened as I feel so ashamed about it.
People, please double check whatever you are buying. Stay aways from "too good to be true" deals.
