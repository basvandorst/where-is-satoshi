To get from LN to chain you can either simply close the channel or use a service like lightning conductor to transfer LN to on chain. I am not sure if this will be a special case though

From the bit of experience I had with LN, it was honestly amazing, 5 sec transaction with 10 sat fees, and it truly is a great scaling method.
But yes, it is not the only scaling method out there, and although BCH can change in the future and grow. But I am looking more at BTC, LN probaly won't be the only scaling method used, perhaps in the future sharding, size increase, or any multitude of new innovations are bound to appear.

It is a meme taken from the movie Avengers: Infinity War, where one of the characters says "I don't feel so good" while fading away in that effect. (Don't wooosh me please)

Still isn't really a fully working network, it is still more or less in beta and not super easy to setup yet.

I meant that this does not make sense in his/her sentence. I think they meant "BTC related billboards"

I get you, but increasing block size like what BCH did will only do so much. If BCH had all the traffic of BTC back in Dec and Jan, I am sure the increased size would not have been enough, additionally, the size increase of BCH only allows it to process more transactions, but a transaction still takes 30 minutes for full confirmation, unlike almost intant and cheaper LN transactions. 
However, I also agree that BTC does need to improve the on-chain system, if not for more actual transfers, then at least to be able to open and close more LN channels.
I have already used LN before and there are many cool things popping up that try to show it off, but LN won't take off until it becomes far easier to use and the BTC chain is proven to be able to handle it.
