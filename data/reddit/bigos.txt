Pages and pages of all drug types, advertised as on ebay: "LSD 150ug 5x12 blotters", "Hundreds of happy customers" type of descriptions, stolen databases for sale, with hundreds of thousands emai/passwords pairs, with couple of hundred samples posted, guns and ammo (I'm from Europe so that was a MINDFUCK for me), "assasina for hire" type of offers. Communication with the sellers over throwaway, encrypted email and absolutely, virtually no confidence in anything you could read or see.
You can just google for "silkroad screenshot" and see some of it for yourself. 
Watching it happen real time though, and possibility of participarting was something else.

Yes. But this is not evolution. Evolution is masses and species gene pool. CEOs lose at genepool, therefore CEOs lose at evolution. They still have better lives than most of us, but in this particular field, they lose.

I wasn't scammed either, but it was obvious that performing a scam would be very simple and impossible to prosecute. You had escrow systems and lists of recommended sellers, but still, I would NOT be surprised if any of my packages wouldn't have arrived.

Yeah, of course you would prefer the CEO kid. Except the evolution doesn't value CEOs any better than any other of your "trailer trash" kids as long as they reproduce. And and as said, poor people reproduce more, so in the end, it's their traits that would dominate.

Not those owning 78% of existing BTC. Because they still own it.
I'm aware that current speculative nature of bitcoin market leads to bubbles and crashed. But aren't those whales TOO big?
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:12:56
Yeah. Why is everyone ok with a claim that 1000% a year is natural to  BTC? This has no backing in anything whatsoever. Since the real economy doesn't grow that fast the bitcoin cannot grow that fast indefinetly.

Thanks for the answer, but I think you're wrong here. When a whale cashes out, he ends up in a situation where he's got a big pile of dollars and a dramatically cheap bitcoin due to panic. What prevents him from buying back in, and cheaper? I think that's a classic stock market play. The cash out isn't really a threat neutralization, it's a harvest time.

Except the trust of general public might be broken by then, especially among the speculating masses that are in right now. So would BTC value would even recover?

I don't see what does chart has to do with our discussion? "bitcoin day destroyed" is time in days someone owned a BTC amount * this amount. Does this chart mean that original owners distributed their BTC? I don't see how, if you do could you elaborate?


Yeah, but that's a guess. It is certainly possible to count every address with, for example &gt;1000BTC and check how big fraction of total BTC's amount they represent. Still it wouldn't count the people who own multiple addresses and dispatched their coins all over them, but we'll never going to be able to track them.

That would be memome

Yeah, I'm not opposed to Bitcoin, I do own some and also used some in the past to purchase goods. But these news worry me and I'd like to discuss it with other people who may know something more on the matter.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:55:38
So, you're claiming it's not true and BTC's are in reality more evenly distributed? I'm asking because of the "researchers' findings". I know they made some extraordinarily claims that they couldn't prove (like, Trammell is Satoshi thing), but I didn't see anyone disprove the distribution.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:58:08
Yeah, but also they would end up with a kind of big pile of dollars they didn't have before. It's a win-win for them. More of national currency and more of BTC.
