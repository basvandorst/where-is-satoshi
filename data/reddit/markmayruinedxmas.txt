i noticed your obligatory disclaimer stating that you own bitcoin. so, this begs this question: what are *you* doing with *yours*? it seems applying your technical analysis would indicate you're keen on exchanging now for fiat, and re-investing when it hits previous resistance levels to maximize holdings, as 99% of your analysis focuses on this thing rolling back, and 1% basically is "or, on the other hand, it could go up". 
whatcha doin with yours? i'm holding now, but damned if i'm not tempted to pounce on this $5-$6/btc rollback we saw this afternoon. i got a few at 68 -- thank you, sweet, sweet dwolla deity for finally having my mt. gox account verified and bank account linked so i'm not at the whim of the mighty overlord that is the coinbase rolling max limit -- but i'm on the fence about what to do with my play money from my next check.
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:49:17
exactly. you can do all this, or just use mt. gox. tough choice, that is.
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:53:56
I'm in the same situation $330 transferred around 8pm EST. Only 14 confirmations in 5 hours and nothing showing up? Starting to freak out.
Edit: noticed you from r/opis. My guess is we are probably buying the same thing. 
Double edit: Just had it show up on SR!! Happy joy! I'd check again if I were you. Patience is a virtue!
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:56:10
i will sell you some....for a premium, of course :-) you'll even get it faster than you would from coinbase!
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:01:26
i thought the same thing re: mt. gox. there was a lag with mt. gox anyway though, no? i don't think it will have that effect if so. i only use coinbase, as i'm not ever buying more than 100btc a day.
one thing i've noticed: not a peep about any of this on google or any major outlet. if they get this shored up before the interwebz media catches on, should be a positive thing for bitcoins. i'm just happy this happened at 500m mark cap...any smaller and the sell off would have been 2011 again and any bigger would cause a blip on the same media radar that helped it up to near 50.

I wish I could sneak into my alma mater's computer lab. They had one in the basement of the business school that was kind of tucked away, and a handful of Japanese students were really the only ones who used it.  It would have been perfect.
Actually....they probably were doing just that. Probably driving their bitcoin porches right fucking now.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:58:37
i went ahead and just pm'd that spambot my credit card number; should all go well.
@_date: 2013-03-08 10:34:53
who would? if no one is in the lab, no one is there to notice...unless you're talking about the sys admin and in that case i doubt the 20 year old working part time would give a shit quite frankly. then again, i've never even physically seen a bitcoin rig nor run the client myself, i'm just going off my very limited understanding of how mining works from a tech standpoint. i understand it's deflationary with each coin mined harder than the previous coin mined.
if what i said is totally unfeasible, then disregard it. haha i don't plan on mining anytime soon unless i can get my hands on a) a quantum computer b)a time machine or c) one of those new rigs that i think a MIT student just build. 
from what i understand, the ship to mine bitcoins has sailed. i could be wrong though. can you tell i majored in econ? i only qualified each paragraph in it's entirety with a variation of a good ol "or on the other hand". :)

while i don't necessarily like it, i don't understand the vitriol for those kinds of posts. i think the more people that hear about and put money into bitcoin, the better. sure, i'd like to see more topics on analysis of bitcoin, but there can only be so many of those. 
if you don't like it, don't read it. downvote it and move on. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:35:45
I've found that pounding the buy button relentlessly is the best way. I snuck in a trade today (two whole bitcoins at $54.11!) with this strategy. I hope it serves you well!

i bet you were ear-to-ear on tuesday! kudos to you for holding on. i keep trying to convince the people near me to get in and hold, but if I get over the former hurdle, the latter hurdle trips them up. oh well, more bitcoins for us :)
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:17:13
is it just me, or does this just seem like a sales pitch? i.e. "please buy more stuff! uhhh...it's for the sake of bitcoins!"
if success of this truly meant bitcoins would gain mainstream acceptance, couldn't he sell way under cost to hit his goal, and still make money because mainstream acceptance would mean the value of bitcoins would increase? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:59:19
So you're saying injecting $80B a month into our money supply won't cause *any* inflation...whatever you say, Ben.
@_date: 2013-03-20 05:21:19
i think i saw another commenter on here make a great point; this is a long shot because, with bitcoins, it makes it much harder to charge people for the automatically-renewable subscriptions that users forget they sign up for. companies and website makes a killing off this type of payment plan.
other than that, I completely agree with you. the anonymous nature of bitcoin pairs perfectly with the hush-hush nature of porn.
@_date: 2013-03-12 04:45:32
Nah, 12pm EST. All I can say is be persistent. I didn't think I'd get my purchase in, but luck of the draw I guess. The weird thing is, all day I had no trouble buying coins if I wanted to. I brought up the  confirmation screen about 20 times throughout the day, and each time I backed off.
Then, around 8pm it denied my buy as well around $46. Denied it when it fell to $40-$41 (ohhhh was I fucking pissed), and as a last ditch effort I typed in 6.5 btc and a confirmation/buy screen came up. I didn't even think twice, I just bought. I even still have about $20 in my checking account (I opened a secondary checking account to use as a pseudo-coinbase brokerage account) that had I of thought that trade would go through to confirmation, you bet your ass I would have sunk that in as well. just luck of the draw, I guess. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:54:33
yes, because **he** is the grandpa, i.e. the one resistant to change. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:54:37
so from my bank account to dwolla to mt. gox? coinbase never actually holds my fiat, just debits my account when i make a purchase, so it seems coinbase is essentially superflous in the above chain. if that works though, you have a few satoshi's coming your way! which in 2 weeks, will be worth $100 the way things are going.
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:35:45
yep. persistence is key. also, i've had success making buys right at midnight; my logic is some people may have macros buying/selling right at midnight if it's above a certain price.
edit: maybe i should have buy pounded 30 mins later :/
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:01:42
depends on the interest rate...under 7%? 6 to midnight.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:11:04
any luck with a purchase? things seem to be stabilizing again...
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:17:52
this is the first thing that came to my mind as well
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:45:45
welp, good thing i spend some of my profits from the $6/btc days on some sikroad wares. now is the perfect time to put them to work.

lol the fed is buying $80billion a month in mbs and t-notes...the amount of money currently out there/money supply only strengthens the argument for bitcoin
as a staunch supporter of bitcoins and someone who is in the mortgage industry (i know....i know. still hoping for someone to tip me out of there), i'm quite the fan of QE. and those who say QE will taper off, there is no way. it will be QEinfinity.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:45:02
congratulations. really. i'm thrilled when i see another merchant accept bitcoin, or when the price jumps a dollar or two, but I couldn't imagine how excited you are to be a millionaire. and, as someone who paved the way for users like me today, you deserve it. 
thank you. not only to you, but to all of the earliest of the early adopters. you are essentially one of the founding fathers of bitcoin. 
it is my dream to one day be a millionaire, and for bitcoin to succeed. hopefully they are one and the same.

Pretty crazy looking back at this thread only one month later!
ShakeThatBass gave away, in the matter of ~10 hours, nearly $70,000. That's more than the majority of the United States makes in one year! If you donated $100 to charity, you pretty much received $1000. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:05:38
Never thought I'd be excited to buy them at 44, but with how backed up Coinbase has been, I'll admit I did a little fist pump when my order went through at midnight after that soldout error 20 times in a row...
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:36:22
yeah it's back at $45. my two cents (which are losing ground to our fav currency by the second) is to watch the clock. right when it hits midnight, try and purchase from coinbase. 7/10 this works for me. have the number and everything typed in and don't worry about the price before you hit buy. it will show it on the confirmation screen. 
happy speculating!
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:50:11
I have ShakeThatBass to thank for putting me in the 1%, as his charity bitcoin event started me off in the bitcoin universe. Haven't looked back. ShakeThatBass, you are awesome!
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:06:25
i know this thread is a month old, but I have to say, I love what you did to resolve this "issue"! Your charitable donation/bitcoin trade was absolutely awesome! again, kudos!
@_date: 2013-03-14 14:26:54
Easy: for the convenience of being able to purchase coins online, you have to provide some kind of documentation. Literally EVERY site you can do this on requires some kind of verification. They didn't steal your coins; you just have to verify yourself. It's not difficult.
If you don't want to verify yourself, use a cash deposit with bitinstant.
Look at it this way: If it were easy to buy bitcoins (as it will be in the future), everyone would be in on it, and the price would go through the roof. It's good these hoops exist now, because it allows you to be one of the early adopters, and allots you the ability to purchase the coins for relatively cheap compared to where we think (hope the price will be in the future) :0)
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:16:54

if you get a buy in right now, it will be a coup. i have utmost confidence this thing will get worked out and we'll see it back at 45-47 within a week.
edit: just saw buy at $36.80...jesus. idk what i'm more concerned about, this or whether the 7.5 btc transfer i made to SR around 8 will get lost in the fork.

same here. saw it as low as 43 and waited a hair of a second too long
edit: only had enough in my coin base to snag 6.5 at $43.50 after some serious buy button pounding
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:31:30
that sounds like an amazing idea. if you want any help testing it or beta users/what have you, i'd love to lend a hand, gratis of course :-) it's an awesome concept and i'd love to be a part of it in any way, shape, or form.
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:07:12
i feel that feel. it's weird, I feel like whenever i consciously think "you know what? I want some bitcoins! I think I'll buy 4 or 5 right now. I like where the price is," and I go onto coinbase to make a purchase, I get the dreaded yellow sentence of denial. my "POUND THE FUCKING BUY BUTTON REPEATEDLY" strategy used to work well, but it's a lost cause now.
**but** when I'm at work, bored, and I go onto coinbase to watch the buy/sell move, and I just type in random values to see if I can even get a purchase confirmation screen, i get one. then i'm like "do i really want 2.8 bitcoins at $73? well....I probably wont get the chance to buy them again for a few days..." and I buy them.
TL;DR I bought 2.8 bitcoins at 1045am today, without fiat in my coinbase-linked pseudo-brokerage account, and I need to speed to my local PNC tomorrow at lunch so I don't overdraw and lose a good portion of the potential money I'd make from bitcoins being essentially the god currency. viva la bitcoin.
