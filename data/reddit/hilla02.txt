If people aren't using them for transactions then it has no more inherent worth than gold and further has neither the physical aspects of gold nor the history as a store of value that gold has.  Unfortunately, massive volatility is possibly the worst thing that could happen with regards to increasing the usage of bitcoins in transactions.
Just a disclaimer-  I have no bitcoins, have loosely followed them for a while, and am just interested in them due to my economics background.
*Edit - And just to clarify, I think gold would be a horrible investment at the moment and is almost purely a speculative market.

pets.com will be the next big thing despite questionable utility: bitcoins will be the next big thing despite questionable utility.  It's not an overwhelming leap of faith between the two, if anything bitcoins seem more of a leap of faith than the former.  The best theory I could give you would be PPP and how volatility would erode the ability to convert from bitcoins into a useable currency.  Beyond that, the design of bitcoins makes it relegated to a store of wealth rather than a currency (how many of you are still hoping for a rebound so that your bitcoins will be worth more in real terms in the future, effectively so you can cash out as opposed to converting them into goods and services?  Seriously, remove the emotion from the equation.  It's a deflationary currency that nobody wants to spend), but it's a store of wealth in only 1's and 0's that is notoriously prone to, well, being stolen.
