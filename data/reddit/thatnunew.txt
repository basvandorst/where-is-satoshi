NuBits are just the first item in the Nu network. It can easily peg to any currency.

I think the comment was aimed at people of whom actually have enough money to diversify, or for whom keeping a certain level of crypto for easy moving is beneficial. I don't think anyone said store everything you own in cryptocurrencies.

You may be right, I just wouldn't call it shilling so much as mentioning something I think is directly tied to the comment I responded to, and perfectly in context with the discussion at hand. Shilling just seems to imply more of a soulless blatant advertisement.

It's shown itself to be in Bitcoin this far.


It is if you want a stable store of value, which is the original comment I replied to..


How is this true?


I've actually heard it called the first crypto bank a few times now. Except it's run by anyone who holds NuShares, so it's far more decentralized.


The same thing that would happen if there was a hostile takeover of mining in Bitcoin. Shareholders are just anyone who holds NuShares. Imagine if anyone who held BTC were actually helping decentralize the network, rather than it solely relying on miners? Ghash.io nearly had 51% of the mining power only a few months ago..

If you want to store cryptos and not have the value change, or simply do business, NBT is a far better option than Bitcoin. It stays stable, it transfers in 6 mins vs. 1 hour, and it's much easier to do math with. It actually is a digital currency unlike Bitcoin which is a digital commodity.  
NuBit's volume proves you wrong. It's being adopted and used very quickly, out only 2.5 months and in the top 10 volume almost every day. Bitspark said they may use it for remittance services, Huobi said they are keeping  a close eye on it, enthused developers have come in and started working on various projects - BUT WAIT! Vibr8gKiwi says NBT isn't useful guys! Everyone go home!

Please, before you hit that downvote button  - just hear me out..
Why would I ever. EVER. EVER!! Use BITCOIN as a way to store wealth - instead of one of the cryptocurrencies designed to remain stable? They are much more practical as a way to store wealth.. Sure it can't go up either, but there's plenty of speculative cryptocurrencies out there, so if I want to gamble I can use any of those. But Bitcoin as a way to store value?

That absolutely did not happen.  A draft motion to open source the code is being made and can be found [here]( This motion is intended to be modified as NuBits approaches open source. No motion to open source has ever been voted on in the Nu Network, however if you read the [official discussion found here]( nearly everybody agrees to open source when they feel NuBits has gained enough ground.

The two I know of are NuBits and bitusd. NuBits has grown quickly and seen much more volume and adoption though. Here you go. 1 NBT = $1.
+1 nbt

Why don't you read the whitepaper. It mentions how it's volatility has been both one of the reasons Bitcoin has gained so much success and yet still one of it's major problems.
In Bitcoin, it's just the miners with this control of power, instead of the average user of Bitcoin. Mining power has already shown itself to be dangerously centralized. This is one of the main problems of proof of work.
But you know what? Many people are taking notice. There are many groups and businesses out there that are interested in a stable cryptocurrency, and NuBits is showing itself fulfill that need in a short time. It's volume has been pretty impressive considering it's only been out 2.5 months, in the top 10 of all crypto more days than not, and it even took  one day in late November with over $1M in volume. Smart traders are using it's stability for hedging. NuBits feeds off the other cryptocurrencies volume and that rewards shareholders.
Honestly, since it's held a near perfect peg so far, even if it did somehow fail I think it proves a cryptocurrency will come out, even if it's not already NuBits, and blow Bitcoin away in terms of usefulness in this regard.

NuBits has successfully held a near perfect peg for over 50 days straight since it's release. Pretty sure that's more stable than Bitcoin  has probably ever been. Unless you see the future, saying none of those work is false.
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:23:46
At this point I think it's more accurate to say there are different levels of decentralization rather than just call something decentralized or not. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:35:53
I did not come here to shill NuBits. I specifically did not mention NuBits in this post just for that reason. I only mentioned it when someone specifically asked. Ignore those comments if you wish, and argue my point in the comment you replied to.
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:50:28
Well that's a shame. Perhaps you'll take another look when it open sources.
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:59:35
No, it will be more useful to certain people in the world to use ones pegged to their currency, such as the euro or yuan, rather than the US dollar. And that's what this is all about, creating something useful. But you don't care about that, you just want to sit here and criticize a cryptocurrency that manages to do something new. The typical Bitcoin fanatic.
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:34:35
Whatever arbitrary date you choose for you to trust it is yours to set. The peg hasn't even gotten  close to breaking.
