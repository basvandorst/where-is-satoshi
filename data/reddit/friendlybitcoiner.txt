You druggies are all the same. The only you don't believe it is because Ross is your druggie hero. 
As far as i've seen there is quite some evidence for the murder for hire thing which people like you first ignore and then when it turns out true will simply call a conspiracy. 
I've read it 50 times by now. You are all the same.

All these posts just give me flashbacks to the end of 2013. Dozens of posts like this. 2014 it would happen! It was a sure thing. To the moon!  
Now after the shittiest year ever you just blindly repeat what you said exactly 365 days ago?
I also hope 2015 will the huge for Bitcoin but these pump posts really should be avoided. It just gives the anti's extra ammo.

"Victimless crime blah blah we just ignore the murder for hire case blah blah and if it turns out true we call it a conspiracy blaaah. Because Ross is our druggie and Bitcoin hero so it simply is victimless because we say so! And anything against him we can't use we ignore"

Huh? Really?

Waste of time. Unless you reeeeeaally know what you're doing. 
Keep in mind by far most traders actually lose money.

You expect a country to move to paper wallets? Seriously?
Is there any point at which you will admit that maybe Bitcoin might not be ready for full on mainstream use yet?
I'm new here but i already noticed that a lot of bitcoiners have problems being critical.

Tldr you have no idea what Bitcoin will do in 2015 and the best thing we can do is avoid all the moon predictions we saw about 2014 and just see what will happen.

Do you beg on street corners for money as well or just on the internet?
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:58:39
I don't see it on the mainpage?

Basically you just want some fantasies and dreams and anybody with common sense is not welcome. You just want to hear you're gonna get rich. Anything else is not allowed. 
I've seen 100's of kids like you before. It rarely ends well. I take back my warning. Please invest everything you have. Arrogant little prick thinks he knows it all. We'll see how that works out.

I think this has been posted at least 50 times now. Don't you think that's enough already?
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:50:34
Ah right. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:49:22
"You're gonna get rich if you invest 200 bucks now". 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:32:54
1: you think people here can look into the future. 
2: you only want optimistic answers. 3: only real answers? What does that even mean?
I'll give you a free tip. Don't invest, because people like you usually lose all their money.

This is hilarious. 
I bet this is a Buttcoin troll. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:30:27
Why are you downvoted for posting facts??
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:48:52
You're a fucking disgusting hypocrite. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 22:20:41
That's odd. Any idea why it's hidden if i don't click all? All the other threads seem to be there just not the top one. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:30:49
Are we gonna get 10 of these posts a day now the last week of 2014? Exactly the same ones as the end of 2013. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:32:25
You sell 10 coins at 380 and buy back 11 at 330. You just made 1 coin profit. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:47:14
No. Just don't. It's rude. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 23:38:53
"I have nooooo clue about the murder for hire thing so we better ignore it as it would make my case really stupid. So let's act as if it's totally irrelevant at this point". 
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:17:58
There are at least 200 topics that answer your question as this is asked daily. And each one of those will give you the same answer. Any specific reason that wasn't good enough for you?
