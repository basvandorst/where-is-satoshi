Damn straight, not just hodling but buying in the dip.

What exactly does the capacity metric mean?
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:39:09
Really like it, good job
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:48:03
Agreed I've used them for a few years and great to deal with, excellent support
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:45
Try the Telegraph, is very negative but the articles are usually hugely misinformed
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:04:20
Ok but have the fundamental reasons you bought changed? Over what period are you investing? What is your price target? If you see this as an investment ALL investments suffer corrections, if you thought you would buy and all it would do immediately is keep going up you probably shouldn't be investing.

Read this book, or watch the movie which came out last year both are excellent.

And just so we are clear, not one single banker is in prison anywhere for this mess. Not. One.
Bankers want us to "move on" but considering the rest of us mere mortals are on the hook likely for decades for their criminal actions I don't see why we should.

Actually they didn't say withdrawals would open today, they said:
"With this new system in place, MtGox should be able to resume withdrawals soon."
and then
"We will update everyone again by Thursday at the latest. "
So agreed we should expect an update today if we don't get one that would be poor CS, I would imagine on a problem like this they are working late, so I wouldn't start panicking.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:02:09
Yeah non-news people will spin any tidbit on MtG into somekind of craziness. Not to say things haven't been a bit whack there of late, but some people need to calm down a bit.

Does this data include any of the AML stuff uploaded? Please don't tell me THAT was stored permanently anywhere other than on paper?
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:21:24
Considering how central money is to our existence I've never understood bank holidays or bankers non-customer friendly hours. Why aren't they open at least 7 days a week?
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:09:41
Ok so at this point do those of us owed money need to do anything? It doesn't appear so from reading it but I am not a lawyer!

Fuck Apple. This app looks great, I might have to give the guy some $$.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:42:11
Yes ;)

If you'd asked someone about using the internet in 1993, guess what? You'd have had the same response, once you starting talking about telnet, usenet, ftp and email their eyes would've glazed over. The internet just needed the right tools....then along came mosaic.
But hey go ahead and sell it's pushing the price down nicely for the rest of us ;)
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:22:51
Because someone wants to buy coins on the cheap anticipating a price jump once they reopen?
Seriously this is not news.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:00:43
Hey here's a thought, it could've been in the works for weeks even months. At most companies I've worked at moves are planned months in advance...
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:45:01
This cannot be upvoted enough.
Is it going to take some kind of violent revolution to finally see some banksters behind bars?
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:31:07
And so the endless conspiracy theories and pointless speculation goes on and on and around and around.
FFS let them fix the damn software then we can all get some peace.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:30:19
Have you ever worked at a company before?
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:30:10
Ok but what the hell does "more or less true" actually mean? Its either true or it isn't true.

Maybe he is now too busy with Shade 3D?

I want a Rexus.

Long talk, quite rambling and he doesn't entirely tie up the two ends but still its very good and worth a listen.
My only issue is the constant bigging up of Friedman, he and the Chicago School one of the worst things that happened to the last half of the 20th century.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:21:30
Well the price is only floundering on MTG because no-one can get any coins in or out, so its just the traders with money already in there. 
Once MTG opens back up I predict things will be back to normal in weeks.
Everyone seems to forget Bitcoin is a very young tech, its like the internet was in 1995. Probably a lot of people here bitching weren't even born back then.
@_date: 2015-01-21 08:15:53
Which bank?
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:41:40
This. The SINGLE biggest issue MTG have is their awful communications and customer service, and the blame for that has to lay far and square with Karpeles. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:31:07
Bcash is basically pointless now, what with this and Lightning. I sold all of mine months ago.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:05:37
Hmm no, Greece was actually one of the few countries NOT fucked by the bankers in 2008, this is one country that purely inflicted this upon itself.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:34:49
Forking waste of time, they should all just fork off
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:11:15
So you can see why banks and other financial institutions would be opposed to it...
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:06:44
More like the whole post

Were you trying a wire transfer? Did you get it yet?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:43:26
Since no-one can apparently get any money out, support seems to be a non-existent circle jerk and Mark Karpeles is hiding under his desk like a 5yr old and won't speak to anyone. It doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:04:27
Now if only MtGox haven't become so utterly useless
