would be funny if bitcoin price goes the other way around 
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:31:01
hahaha yeah mate I share the same feeling, I saw it at 560$ this morning but did not pull the trigger, but I bought some at 610, lets see , it is looking bullish

Couldn't this drive bitcoin's price up as people who invested in ETH/DAO take their money out of it and put it back in bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:02:56
sorry ? I didn't really get what you tried to say. I'm asking these sort of question because I'm trying to identify some sort of pattern of this recent up and down we are going through that links to past trends such as 2013 or earlier
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:06:53
coinbase went from 657 to 707 in 5 minutes I just wish I had funds omg
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:49:45
Bitcoin amazes me so much in 15 minutes I saw it going from 636 to 667 at the moment I type this, ate all my nails, my liquidation is at $607 hahaha
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:22:29
yeah 580 up to 630 wow
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:54:25
two days ago I bought it at 767$ ouch, but my goals are long hodl, still is very hard to see i going down this hard. I I just hope I don´t get liquidated.
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:59:40
well I do not know man, to be honest with you I think we are still going to see a few bounces back to the support level of 570 before heading up again, and that is because we had a big rush back when it was 570 up to 789 in just a week so the market is just liquidating everyone that had those long positions when the rush started. So for me I will be waiting until all these people who tossed a bunch of money on long positions in the middle of the run to get tired or liquidated. I am new to trading but that is how I am thinking at the moment
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:21:05
$580 at the moment, really close to break the lastest resistance level
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:24:35
Hey mate a serious question, what makes you believe we are not at the Denial zone of the curve ?
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:42:00
Exactly you have to buy at some point and for me when I saw it coming to 767 I thought it was going to be a good buy, it went to up to 789 in the same day , but now it is just going down very hard, brexit probably won´t happen, australia massive dump happeing, bitfinex issues. But I made some money in past with bitcoin as well bought it at 300$ and sold a couple on 600$ so I guess some time you win other times you loose that´s gambling, but I will be holding this 767 position I don´t care
@_date: 2016-06-22 01:51:09
True :/
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:22:44
I don't think so mate I reckon we are in for some big drops, $650 at the moment, recent brexit polls, bifinex issues, recent dao hack, australian dump of bitcoins, I think we are going to watch some big drops on the next couple of days
