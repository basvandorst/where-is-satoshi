What’s this got to do with btc

I put in $100 a while ago. Worth 700 now and peaked at 1000. I don’t have time to go in to detail but it looks valuable.

Thanks man

But it does have to do with supply; saying theres an issue with people losing their wallets as this means less bitcoin circulating. 
With less circulating, the value of the smallest denomination will increase to accomodate having less bitcoin overall.
Hope I made sense
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:27:11
Then as supply goes down, value goes up

There is a limited amount of BTC. Only 21 million people can own 1 bitcoin. Obviously number is much smaller since some people have more than 1 BTC and others have &gt;1BTC but let's average to 21mm

"Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior the blockchain?" made me laugh.

Literally all you have to do is look at the picture for clues. It says [CoinCodex](Coincodex.com) right there
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:00:31
But you didn't include BTC

Reading the facebook posts linked to this [article]( is amusing and not doing any good for public adoption.
The news article includes quotes from 'experts' including former PayPal CEO and Jordan Belfort.
