Throw away for this one. 
My job disappeared from the city I live in during the last recession. I found myself faced with having to move to find work or change careers. I chose to learn some basic web programming skills to try and make ends meet and also stay where I wanted to live. It was better than searching for non-existent jobs. 
While in the process of learning some programming I learned about bitcoin. This was late 2012 when they were only $15 or so. I became pretty convinced this was the next big thing and that $15 was cheap for a bitcoin. 
In an act of desperation I took a chunk of my dwindling retirement fund and bought some bitcoins. I figured it was either moon or bust. I was quickly going broke anyway so it was just a crazy thing to do. 
I told myself that I had now drank the kool aid. I knew I was now biased towards my bitcoin views. I was now far too invested to be objective. 
Over the 2013 year I went on a more mind warping wild ride than I had possibly imagined. This shit was actually real! I found myself evangelizing pretty heavily on the internets. In April 2013 I suddenly went from rags to riches. I sold some to alleviate my fiat problems. I suddenly lost a ton of money in the subsequent crash. My nerves were learning all sorts of new emotions. 
I think if the price had stayed flat or dropped I would not at all have kept my interest in bitcoin. The main reason I got into it was wild speculation hoping to help my money problems. I wonder now how many people got in last year too late and have now lost a lot of money and interest after taking a loss. 
I've since dedicated myself to full time education with coding. I could already tell it was a hot future career, but now with bitcoin I can see that programmable money is the future. And yes - it will hopefully keep me out of the poor house.
