I think the biggest opportunity for business is that the payment is oneway. No chargeback is possible, just when you do it as a gesture of goodwill. Therefore any kind of fraud is eliminated.

Depends on your goal/target. Short term or long term? If long term then buy now.

Have no experience with them. Was thinking to buy some coins, but the exchanging rate/fee was too high for me. I am now using the service of Kraken.com and I am still satisfied. Just the verification process is annoying at the beginning. FYI my location is Germany.

FYI Fidor has a partnership with [Kraken]( Very fast process of fiat money deposits. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:55:11
I have no problems with Kraken. Funding process takes max. 1-2 hours until it is available in my account. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:02:20
Nice to know. I live in Germany, too. Do you have any examples for banks that closed previously bank accounts?
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:39:53
No, Fiat money. Just google it.

You can use localbitcoins.com via VPN or try bitcoin-treff.de.

And how do you cash out your BTC without a bank account?
@_date: 2017-01-21 06:30:59
Same here. Done my t3 registration 3 days ago and wait now for confirmation. Contacted the support yesterday via mail, but get no response.
I am just watching how the BTC price is rising and rising. ��

But what about the payment of wages? Don't know any employer, which pay out wages in cash. Sure, it would be great. Therefore I ask myself, why we need a bank account to receive our wages nowadays. =/

Look there! An Bitcoin ATM with German language, but unfortunately not in Germany. Oh, depends on what time frame we are speaking of. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:50:47
Time to sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:54:21
Easiest and fastest way: Open an account at Kraken.com and at Fidor Bank. They both have a cooperation. Your fundings are processed almost instantly with no wire fees.

Lass dich nicht von der niedrigen Transaktionsgebühr auf anycoin locken. Der Teufel steckt im Detail. Der Umrechnungskurs BTC/EUR wird dir nicht angezeigt und ist sehr schlecht im Vergleich zu einer Crypto-Börse.

Looks like a scam. First, he or she try to earn your confidence. Take your profits and go away.

"The Bahamas has no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%."

You do not get the point. The problem is not the currency itself. It is a money laundering prevention from the German finance authorities. Cashing out or trading with Monero with greater sums on exchanges which are based in Germany you would be fucked up, too.

Hast du denn je mehr als 10.000€ auf dein Bankkonto auszahlen lassen? Das wäre doch eine wichtige Tatsache, oder waren es nur die Trades?

Asked the same [question]( yesterday in @_date: 2017-05-04 14:57:30
No one will tell you his net worth.
