I wonder if maybe it's a state by state thing that they have to contact you? No idea, more than likely BS. Was just seeing if this was a mass email. Guess i will just have to wait until the phone number change is complete.
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:11:48
OK, will do. whenever the number change is done.
