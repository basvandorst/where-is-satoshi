For January 1 for withdraw only. That was shared in July.
But 4 days ago they announced a roadmap excluding BCH buying, selling, depositing, and out of the blue it shows up, BTC sells off and they block selling off of BCH?
Not going full tinfoil hat but it's definitely strange, the timing of this all.

this is amazing and it sparked a conversation at dinner tonight. I saw you did something similar but there is a project called Water4 I'd love you to look into, specifically their efforts for the Congolese Pygmys who are enslaved and dying of waterborne disease. The guy who essentially frontmans the project is an absolute mensch by the name of Justin Wren - he is a Bellator MMA fighter using his platform as an athlete to raise awareness that these oppressed people travel miles each morning to collect contaminated water and their children die of waterborne illness frequently. The man has gotten malaria 3 times in these travels and it has never once impacted his will. You can hear him on Joe Rogan's podcast and see how genuine and selfless he is in his mission. 
The donations you've already made are unreal and it would change so many lives -- and bring even more awareness to bitcoin to boot -- to donate to this cause. With Joe Rogan's platform they raised over $50k in today's dollars in BITCOIN alone, to contribute anything like what you've done for these other charities would be hugely impactful and if you hear Justin speak about it you will know that such a contribution would go to not just a great cause but to one of the world's most selfless people and it would likely be the largest single contribution anyone has made to the platform.
I'm sure you are being lit up with requests but please consider this one. Clean water wells are being dug for the pygmys at like $1000 a pop or something like that. A Pineapple Fund contribution would provide literally thousands of people with clean water for decades.
All my best

Carter is my go to guy. Very level headed recap and always clear about what statements he makes are speculation vs history lesson etc. Also makes his daily episodes available on youtube and as a podcast so it's listenable on a commute.
Meeting him tomorrow in SF actually - bay area folks can sign-up for the meetup still!
Also just subbed to this Crypto Investor guy. Like his style.

This is actually a pretty good question a colleague posed to me while talking cryptos yesterday.
For example, Steem. I 100% support the idea of small value tipping or purchasing of content to avoid ads and support content creators. If I watch 100 YouTube videos a month and tip each creator $0.01 USD, that's only $1 a month to put money directly in the hands of the content creators and I get to skirt ads. EASY. Love this idea. The content creators control their income, the consumers control their payment for it at a $0.01 per video or greater level. No need for a third party, ads, threatening to demonetize, etc. It's a real issue right now that needs solving.
But why not just do that with a penny? In fairness I haven't done much real DD on Steem but I'm curious why we need a new form of currency for this system to work?

Buying the BTC at $5 a pop will still sting you with a transaction fee even before the transfer itself, no?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:53
for real, is OP trying to say he has 8000 BTC? so like 80 million USD? breh. do this in deadass silence and if needed facebook gym lawyer

Many things mostly related to the underlying technology being decentralized. Every high net worth individual in the world couldn't own 1 whole BTC as a diversification/safety play even if they wanted due to supply.
Ask Zimbabwe and Venezuela what value a decentralized or universal currency might have..

I'm not a CPA but my understanding is that currently crypto is taxed like property. Capital gains on net gain of anything sold to fiat within a year of purchase.
That said if you're in college you're likely not playing for high stakes, it's extremely unlikely the IRS bothers to audit or fine anyone taking small gains, so if you're working with a few hundred bucks.. Eh. Again not pro advice haha

I'm getting 10k FOMO like I'd be missing y2k Times Square ball drop, sleeping late, checking it first thing in the morning, I would really appreciate if someone here could drive the price to 10k while I'm awake and refreshing Blockfolio so I can get back to my regular life this week. Thanks
