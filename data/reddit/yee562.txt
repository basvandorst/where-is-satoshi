What kind of card do you have? The terms are vague, because technically my card was a rebate debit card

Have you tried linking the card? Mine was a MasterCard as well! You need to have a pin setup and an online account for the prepaid card so you can confirm the "test" transactions from coinbase

Yeah I dropped another $500 before it hit 14k now I'm really happy

I'm wondering this too, is there a way to bypass fees or at least get lower fees than Coinbase? I've heard of Gemini but I can't find the app for it.

When I was 16 I was offering to do any chores/jobs for money. I also sold stuff on eBay and Craigslist. Anything worth money that I didn't mind letting go. I got rid of my Pokémon collection, yugioh card collection, Nintendo systems, gameboys, old iPods, iPhones etc. I got lucky and found a 1966 Fender super reverb in the dumpster when my mom asked me to throw out the trash. I reluctantly did so , and when I found the amp, I restored it for $300 and sold it for $1650 m. Bought my first car! You can't acquire the "hustle" but you can learn to hustle.  I was recycling cans, bottles and copper etc

I just bought $200 worth of BTC with my Verizon Rebate card. 2 days ago.

As much as everyone wants to say "thanks" "more for me" blah blah blah, props to you for calling it quits when you decided too. Are you a giant pussy? Maybe, but you had some balls just by admitting you sold on this sub.
