Why does the music have to be so loud? I stopped watching.. uncomfortable

Not if McAfee is right.. It will be worth a lot more in 3 years time. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:18:04
You can give it a try. There are settings to limit the amount of RAM. Definitely get the latest Armbian version to enjoy max RAM. Good luck!

What's to gain from investing in Tesla? I would consider that a lot riskier than investing in BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:57:15
I've read mixed stories about this. Some people say it won't last long, but other say it shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:56:14
Yes sure. First I wanted to figure out if this setup works. Maybe Black Friday will come up with a good deal on a 512gb SDCard. If so I might get it and try running a full node.
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:42:57
You're right! Thanks for pointing this out
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:37:12
Wow thanks :) My first tip ever haha
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:44:46
Oh wow I didn't know that exists. I noticed an old BitTorrent project that shared the blockchain but it stopped a while ago.
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:55:02
First time you always have to sync the whole blockchain. Running it in pruned mode only makes Bitcoin core throw away the old blocks after verification. So you'll end up with minimum 550MB of data. 
Bitcoin core automatically connects to other nodes. Nothing needs to be done for that. In my config I do have some nodes preconfigured because they say it's good to do when running it with Tor.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:55:22
Thnx good tip!
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:02:29
Last time I read that the Armbian version was not yet supporting WiFi. If you can it's better to use the Ethernet port. Have fun!
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:56:46
That would be very cool to try. But like some other people are saying, I'm wondering if my SD card will have any problems in the near future? That would be one of the reasons to invest in a 512GB SD card
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:43:21
I copied them from one of the Tor manuals
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:13:20
I don't have any experience with the Raspberry Pi, but I've seen manuals on Google that show you how to install a bitcoin node on a pi. Have a look at this [tweet](
@_date: 2019-11-12 11:43:06
So as far as I know the biggest downside of running a pruned node is that you can't help new nodes to sync the full blockchain. For now that's not a big issue, because there are (still) enough full nodes up and running. But of course, running a full node would be better.

Also the Rock Pi S only has a USB 2 port which is killing :(

No, at the moment there are 16.7M others like this handsome. They even forecast 21M of them in the future!

I just updated the post with a short how to and some links. Have fun!

You working for MC? Best intentions... LMAO 
@_date: 2019-11-12 16:36:30
Yes you can limit the bandwidth. I've got unlimited data here, so for me it's not a problem. Still very good you're running a node. Helps the network!
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:44:29
Oops lol

Sounds pretty weird.. You've got a call from a stranger that talks about bitcoin? How he even knows you're interested in that? 
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:40:45
Roger who?
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:09:51
Roger, is that you?
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:13:38
True. I'm on holiday in Croatia and tried to pay for dinner with Visa.. Didn't work.

Look at your profile. You're shilling your own videos. All others vids you've posted to to the same account. GTFO

Stupid cute solutions? Good luck accusing the bank of stealing your private keys. At least take 2 deposit boxes  at different banks and split the keys. But if that's a stupid cute solution then whatever
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:26:45
I just did:
You could give a family member 50 percent of your private keys and create a will with the other 50 percent of the keys and state that they will get it after you die.
And also you could use a deposit box but never with 100 percent of the keys. Just put 50 percent on an encrypted email (tutanota) and give access to family member. But for the deposit box you should need same conditions. Only access after proof of death 
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:14:34
And leave your private keys there? Never ever. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:26:19
I would never use a traditional bank for this. I've posted my solution. It doesn't include a bank. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:21:26
Funny I'm getting down voted for this. It's like writing down your pincode and leaving that behind together with your bankcard and trusting another party to take care of it.

I'm from the Netherlands and I know. That's why I said it
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:42:33
You can leave a sealed envelope behind. That's private. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:28:00
I'm sorry, but you can leave private sealed letters to only be opened by somebody you appoint it to. So stop making up nonsense. And I was talking about leaving 50 percent of the key in a letter and the other 50 percent you can give already.
So even in case you would be right, somebody else that would open the letter only has 50 percent of it.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:31:31
Come back in a few years and you can do it everywhere

Probably because nowadays more people do the same trick. They tell the scammer they've send the money, but it doesn't show up. When you say 'confirmed' he can reply back that he doesn't see any transaction.
