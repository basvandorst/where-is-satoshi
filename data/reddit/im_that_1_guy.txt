It's a breath of fresh air in a capitalist economy. That's why I've been getting fairly vocally angry at companies attempting to make Bitcoin a stock/futures/investment platform.


... because it's not a valid means of exchange. The proof-of-work system is great for validation of transactions, but you don't earn Bitcoins by working. You earn them by buying expensive hardware with exploitation-derived capital.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:25:01
Where did your company get the capital to start up? How were the raw materials manufactured? Why should people in the first world be educated enough to write a book, leaving the third world out to dry? How do those worker collectives exist in a capitalist economy if not for regulation?
But that doesn't seem to be your main concern. Your concern, as you state, is:


That's a pretty natural wish, from a capitalist perspective. The funny thing is, that's not something prohibited by communism. Resources are allocated based on an individual's value to their community. If you make a groundbreaking app that's useful (IMO there's not much place for, say, Angry Birds in a communist society), you will have additional luxuries. Not luxuries to exploit, or be the leader of a hierarchy, but actual tangible stuff.

@_date: 2013-06-06 19:44:30
Something just occurred to me... Bitcoin has a very long confirmation time compared to most altcoins. Is the conf time more than ~15 hours or so? If so, that's my issue.
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:21:08
Glad I cashed my few Bitcoins a few weeks ago. I bought a share in a mining operation, for $50 or .5BTC (like I said, I used Bitcoins). Now he's selling at .6BTC a share, because of how dramatically the price has dropped, and I expect it to be .65BTC after this most recent drop.
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:58:16
This may be dumb, but... how d'you buy into ASICMiner shares? I've gone over their site several times, and there's no mention of price for hardware or shares, much less a way to purchase them.

When I go to P2Pool and put in my Qt address, it says I'm mining. When I go to my Qt wallet, the only transactions it shows are Bitcoins I sent from my old 50BTC and Coinbase accounts.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:42:05
If you have a high enough market share before any other players have started selling the product, congratulations, you've cornered the market. You're then free to assimilate or strongarm any new startups until you quite literally control the entire market.
And yes, this is what happened with Standard Oil. There were smaller companies, but they were gobbled up or forced out of the market with anti-competitive practices such as price gouging.

Oxymoron much? Anyways, nobody's "letting" big banks, the fed, or whoever, fuck them over. I'm not sure if this is what you're trying to say or not, though, because I'm confused by your wording.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:04:20
There are no businesses, as such. People are free to contribute their skills in a business-like endeavor, but it's completely different than a business in a capitalist sense.
If you've made yourself money by creating a product, you're still bourgeoisie. The materials you used to create your products didn't appear out of thin air, somebody was exploited in their production. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:22:46
Underregulation, not overregulation, is what caused the 2007 stock crisis and ensuing recession. Bankers and traders were allowed to do almost anything they wanted to make themselves money, screwing over the working class the world over. Plus you've got monopolies, third-world exploitation, etc. etc. I don't understand why y'all are scared of "big government" when the only other (capitalist) possibility is "big corporate." I'd trust the ones who at least ostensibly have some accountability.
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:54:34
Wait, what do they have to gain by devaluing Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:33:19
IDGAF if it gets mainstream if all that happens is that the market gets saturated by the fucking predatory traders.
I know Bitcoiners hate the government. But that's not the root of the problems. It's letting the traders and the bankers run amok. Government regulation hurts your average Joe a hell of a lot less than a banker running away with his life savings by playing the markets. And programs like this will make it easier for that to happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:53:31
But it doesn't need to be profitable long-term. They just price-gouge (or buy out) a competing company, and then once the competitor's bankrupt they can raise the prices back up. Profit margins can stay insanely high, then dropped whenever a competitor enters, then raised to or above their previous levels.
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:12:32
Earned: small-time mining
Spent: I've never spent, though I'm considering buying shares in an ASIC operation (not ASICMiner)
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:42:08
Yeah. I'm getting a bit worried about the organizer, though. It started off as just a Saturn buy, 78 shares per machine, so every share had the same hashrate. Then he decided to bring Jupiters into the mix, with shares at the same price as the Saturns, and didn't give people who were on the already-ordered Saturns an option to upgrade. I and several others are trying to make it so each share is equal (which is really not at all hard to do, and it vastly simplifies accounting and what would happen in the event that a machine stop working), but he's not exactly being responsive. I don't think it's malicious, I just don't think he really understands the concept.

Because the OP likes Bitcoin and cameras, therefore it fits perfectly!
That's the entire gist of just about every "Let's get Merchant X to accept BTC!"

You're not going to buy the app with cash, or credit card, or even Bitcoins. You'll spend labor credits. I'd defer to Xaanos or to explain exactly how they work, but effectively it's a means of exchange which can not be hoarded and manipulated in a market.

"Pour payer, rien de plus simple."
"For paying, nothing is simpler"? Bold claim. I don't disagree, I'm just surprised the paper/magazine went so far as to say that.

Each miner is a separate worker (separate GPU/ASIC/CPU).
Create a new wallet address every time you make a transaction with a new vendor. For instance, I have a different address for BitInstant, MtGox, and Coinbase. It helps me keep track of my transactions. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:25:53


I've been in to Bitcoin since well before the recent bubble. But I've only mined half a coin, and that after the bubble. Am I inferior, because I had an exceedingly mediocre GPU before the bubble, and by the time I could mine it was next to useless? Should I bow down to your (or a big miner's, if you're not one) moral superiority because you were rich enough to invest in a large-scale mining operation?
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:46:41
Price. I can get one share representing 2.24GH/s for .5BTC. You get the direct profits from mining as dividends.
It's really more of a co-location thing than investing in shares.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:55:58
Good to see some *actual* leftist perspective. The Bitcoin community becomes an anarcho-capitalist echo room after a while.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:10:28
Somebody wrote the books :P
Anyways, if you made that entire app in a self-sustaining worker collective, that's not capitalism any more, is it?
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:30:59
Mining is generally accepted as income, but the gain that comes from exchange rate increases is capital gains. So it's both. Fun.
@_date: 2013-06-02 02:14:30
Hmm... my non-dedicated 7870 barely cuts it anyways due to power requirements... soon enough I may be pretty much losing money due to increased difficulty. Maybe I'll invest in Butterfly Labs' 5GH/s miner... if it ever shows up.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:05:00
I guess I must have misunderstood your first post. Why (and how) would they capitalize on the hashrate, like you said?
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:11:37
No private messaging until you're verified.

@_date: 2013-06-17 02:22:56
Not really. Invest in shares/co-location (renting, for example, one unit of a very high power ASIC).
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:02:36
Actually, it's 9%! You're effectively paying $55, 'only' $5 of which goes to Western Union! It's even better than you could imagine!

Interestingly enough, this problem is (next to) impossible with USD as well. There are many issues with fiat, but when bills are *specifically* designed to be uncopyable, counterfeit's a non-issue.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:08:12
Libertarians are often either rich businessmen or teenagers with too much time on their hands. Both would naturally be attracted to Bitcoin :P. The big thing, though, is that people want to protect their profits made while mining. That makes libertarianism a natural attraction; it's great for those who already have capital and want to keep it.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:27:43
I don't really think you're making sense.
In your original post, you effectively said that even if you only invest, say, 5BTC and win, you still need for the machine to mine 2000BTC for it to be cost effective. How does that make any sense? 
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:18:30
But if you win the raffle, you've only paid your amount of tickets. So if I enter (I won't) 5 tickets and get lucky, I've only invested 5BTC into it. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:32:38
The operation I bought into basically gives you ~2.6GH/s per share. It pays out as dividends every two weeks (or, will, once the KnC Saturns start coming in). Plus, you can resell the shares (though at a set price, through the group buy organizer, and with a fee). So really it's less like a stock (like ASICMiner), and more like a co-location thingy.
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:10:08
I mine. I lose almost half due to power costs as is, and as difficulty increases I won't break even. I'll be using Mt. Gox or Coinbase to simply buy coins soon, *maybe* get an ASIC, but probably not. I'll move to mining Litecoins on my rig (which is not dedicated), on the off-chance that it takes off.
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:54:54
Interested... though I don't know if I can even do $500. I could buy 2 or 3, maybe.
@_date: 2013-07-04 03:04:29
Hah, I see that.
And yeah, luckily I and a few others are doing our best to explain what to do. It's a pretty simple concept :P. I think by the time the miners start coming in it will be properly run, and that's all that matters.
@_date: 2013-08-22 02:21:05
Cryptocoins do have a *sort of* intrinsic value in the proof-of-work algorithm. **However** some cryptocurrencies are almost objectively better than Bitcoin in various aspects, or else nearly identical; why not use those instead? Because people *believe* in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-26 16:01:16
Why are you using multiple pools?
Also, multiple wallets aren't a problem. You can send/receive coins between them simply. If you want a truly integrated wallet, I'd recommend Coinbase, which also allows you to cash out into USD via a bank transfer. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:43:33
No, I just added the pool address ( found on their site to the applicable place in my batch script, and pointed it at my -Qt wallet as I did when using P2Pool for other currencies.

It'll lead to centralization, the big players messing around with the entire market. Think of what happened in the 2007 stock crisis and the ensuing recession. Big traders, big bankers, centralization, everything that Bitcoin is supposed to be against. If Bitcoin starts being used as a stock platform, we're all in a bad state.

Sure, your point entirely makes sense. Except for one thing: it seems like you're trying to say that looking out for innovation is an implicitly capitalist thing.
Also, the "but catch up" is a lot harder than you make it out to be.
Anyways, we've been discussing for a good while. I think it's time to wind down. Agreed?
