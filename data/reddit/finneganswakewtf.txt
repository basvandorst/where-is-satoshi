Its so refreshing to see this post, because im almost the same as you.  Got in mid 2012, was even able to mine .03 btc from a pool before it became impossible.  Bought around 200.  Used it mostly for online poker.  Now i have just a little over 2 to my name.  No ragreta
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:01:19
Yes he called it all the Jamie Dimon things
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:02:29
Ehhh i have a tx pending since november 8th because i put a fee of 1.17 sat/byte.
Its only for ~$3.60 so at this point i cant wait to see how comically long it will take

Was Hal Finney responsible for bitcoin bearwhale?

Idk about other countries, but, in the United States it is written on the currency:  "This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private."

4 out of 5 dentists agree Bitcoin is the way to go
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:49:23
Not even that, .000021 btc per Bolivar.   So 2100 Satoshi.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:32:18
This is where i have to take a step back and listen to those naysayers and professor buttcorns that we all hate.
All of the money flowing into altcoins is creating a bubble.  There is absolutely no value in altcoins other than what people hope it will be worth.  Bitcoin is OG,  and each alt coin comes with their "this is why were different!" spiel.  
But looking at coin market cap.  You're telling me some of these coins have masrket caps worth hundreds of millions?
Bullshit.  Most altcoins are destined to fall, and fall hard at that.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:30:06
A lot of people think Hal Finney (myself included) was Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:26:40
Yeah and every time I look at bcash block explorer there's maybe maybe 10 tx max per block.  No one is using that shit coin and the transactions prove it.  Once people grasp how to access theirs (I have mine, and I honestly don't know what to do with it) they'll send it straight to an exchange to exchange for bcash dropping the price.
I have another theory that jihan and co are just going to dump all the bcash they mine for bitcoin anyway.  No one uses it, why would it be worth $600?
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:22:07
Maybe gonna try and dump the bch concurrently too?
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:47:15
If you're gonna mine you should mine alt coins and convert at an exchange
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:57:28
Not bch
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:21:42




Yes I know about that one, and the one to $263 in early 2013, but I was considering huge to be 1k+
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:49:49
Yeah 2013 was the first huuuge bubble it peaked at ~1300
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:59:56
Blockchain.info unconfirmed transactions works well too 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:28:56
I finally caved and got my BCH from electrum and converted to bitcoin via poloniex last night.  
Major props to [this guy, and his video]( for easy instructions on how to do this.
After I sent the tx, the only confirmations I got were from the next 5 blocks mined.  I don't see how/why anyone wants to use bch.  The price will collapse when a major bitcoin holder gets their bch and sells 
Edit: I literally made over $1000 appear out of thin air doing this.  It feels like this shouldn't be allowed somehow
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:20:03
Aye!  Ty shills

Or, as I like to see it:
There are more millionaires in the world than total bitcoin that could be produced.  Having just 1 bitcoin is huge.

I don't know why I still do it, but I do.  Like 2 years ago I was getting 40x the amount per collect than I do now, but it's just become so habitual.

I still think the shitcoins are in a giant bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:03
Relayed by BitMinter is my favorite part.  Can't believe they're still going
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:27:37
My $2 btc transaction with a 1 sat/byte fee still waiting.  This is completely ridiculous can't buy coffee *generic complaint* /s
I don't care when it clears, it's just faucet transaction (don't judge I've collected around .4 bitcoin since 2012 on faucets alone)

I didnt even know such a high quality of this video existed

Put money on gdax through bank transfer about a month ago and promptly forgot.  Your post inspired me to check.  Picked up an extra .03 btc than I normally would have.  Thanks for the reminder

I got into the 2.1 bitcoin club last month.  Best i could do

If any of these are forks of the original bitcoin (other than BCH) that I can access thru my OG bitcoin stash lmk so I can dump the shit
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:44:25
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer.
Oh wait that's not a Moby song

Used gdax to avoid fees.  Wise 
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:59:58
Ok considering the lawyer needed help just setting up a wallet, I doubt he can just whip up "an op-return transaction, or at least a hash of it."
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:34:03
Oh man when I finally got my BCH from electrum and sent the coins to an exchange to convert, the waiting period was so damn long to get all 6 confirmations.  
It opened my eyes as to how much of a shitcoin BCH really is.  At the time I transferred them, only 1 pool was mining bch.  But I dumped them for more than double they're trading now, so I'm happy with that.  Literally creating thousands of dollars out of thin air seems questionable though.  Can't wait for a huge hodler to dump like 40k BCH and finally kill it.
Btw if you use electrum and want to know how to get your BCH from electrum, [this 60 second video]( is amazing  
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:26:37
I use electrum to store.  I'm using a pc tho
