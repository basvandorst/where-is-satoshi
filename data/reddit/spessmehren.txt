The fact that this is a meme and is actually presented as serious advice frequently is exactly why Bitcoin is a joke.

Ask the hundreds of thousands of people addicted to crack if its a "victimless crime." Ask the millions of people who have been affected by drug violence in the US, Mexico, and elsewhere if its a "victimless crime." Hell, **ask the six people Ulbricht tried to have killed if hiring a hitman is a victimless crime.**
inb4 you bring up "but all drugs should be legal maaaaaaaaan!!!!!" Yeah well that's not what we're discussing right now, so don't even go there. 
Who the fuck are you to decide what constitutes a "victimless crime?" You know back in the 1940s hanging black people constituted a "victimless crime," and jury nullification was frequently used to acquit white men accused of murdering black people. 
You want to change laws? Jury nullification is the worst way to go about it.

I think it's funny that you automatically assume the woman is the one who wanted the ring. Because, you know, it couldn't have been a man who thinks you really need a $5,000 ring. 
Reddit subtle misogyny at its finest. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 16:02:11
If that's true then it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. If there's anything I learned from reddit it's that they love to sensationalize and they love to break out the pitchforks and death threats with nothing to back up the claims being made. It also humors me when people dig up months-old drama when there's no drama to be had at a particular time. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:27:13


Yeah, you guys really failed at that yesterday. This reminds me of the time Reddit sent "random acts of pizza" to a ton of Boston police precincts after making a huge mess out of the Boston Bombing witch-hunt.

If you think putting average Joes with zero real-world experience in banking in charge of one of the world's largest banking agencies is a good idea, I can't really help you. 
Then again if you're the type of person who takes what they read on GlobalResearch.ca, a conspiracy site that publishes lies, fabrications, and half-truths at face value I'm not surprised.

Byzantine General's Warning for Bitcoin: Using this commodity as a currency can result in significant loss in value over a short amount of time.

Long term speculators who haven't yet lost any money since they bought at &lt;$100 coming out in droves saying "DON'T WORRY GUIS, THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN!!!!!!111..." while totally ignoring the fact that a vast majority of people are losing money? Also normal for Bitcoin. 
And cue the downvote brigade from long-term speculators only interested in preserving their own bottom line. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:13:41
It's funny, I *just* got downvoted for calling this a bubble. And look what happened. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:57:19
Yup, a college professor with degrees and decades of experience in financial markets is no match for a redditor whose entire understanding of currency came from Google and Wikipedia. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:10:39
I have to say, the shitfest and "lets destory our apple products because they pulled an app from the app store!" was one of the most cringe-worthy things I've ever seen on reddit, and I was around for the Faces of Atheism. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:31:07
I don't think the numbers were ever intended to be accurate, it's more about the other points he makes, especially in regard to 47 power players theory. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:58:34
Not really. When major corporations start accepting Bitcoin, it's not because they think Bitcoin is a legitimate currency or that it has any potential to normal people. They just know TONS of nerds have thousands of dollars in Bitcoin hoarded away because they can't do anything with it except trade, so by accepting Bitcoin they'll see tons of new sales. 
The TigerDirect phenomenon is a prime example of this. Very few people went out of their way to buy Bitcoin just to use on TigerDirect.

I've seen numerous highly upvoted  calls to doxx a certain "cunt" and "bitch," and indeed there has been a pastebin being posted around here. The mods got to most of the posts in time, but quite a few were left up for the whole world to see. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:02:02
Well it costs roughly $500/coin to mine Bitcoin, and with the prices tanking hard right now, we're likely to see at least some of the big Bitcoin miners run themselves into bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:13:18
Go check Bitcoinity right now. Bubble literally just popped.
The fact that Bitcointards go and mass downvote (read: censor) anything negative about Bitcoin shows a dangerous disregard for reality. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:55:27
Saving this so I can mention you were wrong. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:51:56
Because China got this bubble started. Everyone was all like "OMG ALL THOSE PEOPLE ADOPTING BITCOIN!!!! &lt;3" 
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:09:51
No matter how much you might disagree, the story IS newsworthy. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:51:14
It seems that most of your points require the ownership of an expensive smartphone and an even more expensive dataplan, a luxury many people (including myself) cannot afford or do not view as a necessity. Does that mean Bitcoin is useless to a significant amount of people, including entire socioeconomic classes on the lower end of the spectrum? 
OP, I'd love to see you mention this in your next video as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:34:33
I've seen people blaming the victims all the time, these posts are usually highly upvoted and makes the comparison to rape, showing just how delusional and sickening those people are. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:36:39
What the fuck does this have to do with fiat currency? 
The reason people were tying the Gox fiasco to Bitcoin was because at the time, Gox *was* Bitcoin. It was the largest exchange, *everyone* recommended them until about a month before they went under. I've never even heard of this random site. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:15:12
Like it or not, it's newsworthy. No amount of crying and calling her misogynistic slurs is going to change that.

This is very important. OP sounds like a legit investor. A majority of is made up of young 20-somethings with low-paying jobs and student loan debt, the exact type of people who shouldn't be anywhere near investments, let alone gimmicks like Bitcoin. 
Downvotes tell me I've struck a chord.

Using the words of MLK to defend a guy facilitating the illegal sale of guns and drugs. Disgusting. 
Thank god any attorney worth his salt screens out libertarian retards during the jury selection process. 
Ah yes the good 'ol reddit libertarian censorship technique: if you downvote the post enough and censor it from view, it automatically invalidates my point!

I'm commenting here to remind everyone on January 1, 2016 how this never happened.
I've commented on articles about Bitcoin going mainstream in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Nothing. This is pretty much the new "x is the year of the Linux desktop" fad. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:19:56
But that's all a majority of people are doing. What happens when everyone is speculating instead of using Bitcoin as a currency?

@_date: 2014-11-13 16:32:19
Honestly Dogecoin tipping got ridiculous because it amounted to throwing pennies at people. I remember the post about the guy who lost his entire life savings or had his brother die or something along those lines, someone tipped him $1. 
Same thing is happening here too. Tipping is just stupid and does nothing but creates spam and circlejerks. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:34:45
Well it DID fall 60% since this article is published, it's absurd and downright dangerous to be delusional enough to think this couldn't happen. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:48:40
is this a deliberate attempts to mock this subreddit's obsession with pointing out that random companies no one has ever heard of nor would use otherwise now accepts bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:55:23
Quite sad I had to scroll this far down to find someone capable of logical thinking. This subreddit is getting more and more gullible every day. The fact that this unconfirmed post has so many upvotes, while people were willing to send death threats to a journalist for publishing an equally unconfirmed news article... holy shit the cognitive dissidence is strong with this one.

Look into the shady doings of some of the mods here for further proof. During the early bubbles, the mods would ban any negative posts, and then any posts about prices, during bubble crashes. This censorship was imposed to protect the mods' bottom lines. One moderator is well-known to have hoarded hundreds of Bitcoins donated to him under the guise of performing "forum upgrades," but in reality never spent any of the coins and "HODLed" them until they were worth millions to line his own pockets. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:34:44
You just bought at the height of a bubble. Sorry to say, you're probably going to lose money. Also sorry to say this post will be downvoted (read: censored) so no one sees the truth. 
Hah, not even *two hours* after this post was downvoted, bubble burst! 
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:58:49
Have you seen the markets lately? We're about to go off the deep end of despair. People who are only interested in making a quick buck like you and this reddit cunt are KILLING Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:58:26
It's fucking hilarious. I've been saying this was going to happen for weeks. 
China is what got this bubble started, and whenever I pointed out that Chinese government action in Bitcoin would pop the bubble I got downvoted.

And any idiot ass criminal can target the families of any celebrity or corporate CEO whose full name and address are routinely broadcast in the media. 
That's what I don't get. People are making such a big deal out of the fact that he's a millionaire, therefore if anyone knows who he is he'll be killed for his money, yet there are thousands of people with MORE money who could make even easier targets.

Actually the crash is because Bitcoin really *IS* failing. People are finally waking up and realizing this thing has no future, it will never reach mass adoption, and the only people wasting their time with this are people who want to get rich quick.
