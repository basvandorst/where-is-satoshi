I use Dasset.co.nz if you buy litecoin its normally pretty close to the actual price and you can transfer it off to a better exchange.

So you're posting opinions on a cryptocurrency you fundamentally know nothing about and are not listen or even trying to learn from vast majority of people who are commenting and probably know alot more about it than you?

Doesnt sound like it. What do you mean by "went rouge on the dark web?"

Its because people can steal credit card or paypal info and buy coins with the stolen info.. then when the cards are reported stolen the exchange or website that sold the bitcoins has too go through a big process of proving they when and who they sold they coins and sometimes have to give the money back. It creates alot of hassle for people who are selling them. Plus.. there alot of countries now that require you to keep records.
