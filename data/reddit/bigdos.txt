But I prefer using fiat. That plasticy film just helps it slide up my nose in a smooth and refreshing way.  But I hope for a time when the only real use for Fiat is as a convenient cole sniffing device.

Eth and it's infinite swathes of alt coins are dragging the whole economy down.  I am truly glad it is dying.  Great tech, geat idea but it's time to go now Ethereum.  You were used and abused and now hopefully maybe finally we can start to see some real projects grow out of those heady days of 1000X growth in a few months.

There is much debate from islamic schollars about whether it is considered haram to invest in share markets as they are seen as a form of gambling.

I'd say the litecoin halving that's happening today is a key reason why there is such movement.

Yes take it from me and probably a lot of others here.  Best to just buy Bitcoin and resist the temptation to diversify.  The price of all altcoins is pretty much pegged to Bitcoin.  You wont see any major shifts without a move from Bitcoin first.  Even if there is a few days delay.   I've held bags of shitcoins for years during the bear market.  It was only when I did some calculations that I realised I should have just gone all in on BTC from the start.
