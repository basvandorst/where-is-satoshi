First of all, how quickly can someone currently convert their BTC into cash at a local outlet with their phone, but without their physical wallet?  Secondly, let's say they don't have BTC but we trust and want to help them?

An image is hardly a complaint.  Their uptime during high volume periods is much greater than Mt Gox, and I appreciate the interface and the easy ability to Xfer Dwolla.  But when was the last time Google went down?
I'm pretty sure it's in the contract that unforeseeable technical issues are not grounds or compensation.

Cryptic to those who lack a thorough understanding of the math underlying bitcoin or cryptography in general, like myself.
I still trade them, of course.  I don't need to be capable of making creme brulee in order to enjoy it.

True, but we can distinguish between blockchain and sketchy websites that want us to transfer BTC to them so they can steal them.  Perhaps we could, as a community, gamble $20 on someone with a 5yr history of posting on Reddit?
I'm hardly a philanthropist, but if we can +tip people for mildly interesting comments isn't it worth figuring out how we could buy them a couple gallons in an emergency?

Even if they got the last few, Litecoins would take their place.

I'm not here for resolution. If I mention in passing that I lost my wallet today, I don't ask you for the money and to call my credit card companies for me.

At least they have CloudFlare, but it's still not very useful.

If there was a roundabout way, I'd be glad to hear it.  If not, this is something for the BTC entrepreneurs to think about.

I don't believe AA works that way.  Prove me wrong.
Several states have similar services (Hoosier Helpers in Indiana), but I'm not sure that all do.

AAA will send someone with gas, but you have to pay market price.  They will also tow 5 miles, but if you are more than 5 miles from home, how do you pay for gas?

Also, their verification requires blocked popups.  I went through the process several times before I realized and used Firefox to complete.  Spammy and unprofessional.  Now I have to wait several more days.  Wire transfers cost about 0.3 BTC if you use them.
For the paranoids who would never verify: I'd rather dox myself to a bank than nervously hang around CVS like a meth-head on my few days off.

Put it this way: If you try to bank transfer to someone, you have to wait days for it to go through because of fraud and NSF possibilities.  If you send via credit card, the safety depends on how closely the charging company verifies your identity.  If they are lax with sigs or checking ID, too many chargebacks and their account is shut down.  But if all merchants accepted bitcoin, fraud potential is minimal for small transactions and wait time is also minimal (more than 1 second, but less than 30min with proper fees).
You can buy Greendot disposable credit cards at tons of gas stations and drugstores.  They are wary of accepting credit cards as payment for them because that's an easy way to turn stolen cards into untraceable funds.  Why not give them BTC as an alternative?  You can't creat BTC from a stolen ID like you can with credit.

It wasn't moot when I was desperately trying to cancel one order and place another based on market shift.  Trading still went on while I couldn't access the page, so I lost money.  I don't see the point of backup servers or loading balancing or whatever CloudFlare is doing for them if nothing still works.

It's all right there on the page: 
-MoneyGram Money Orders
Money Orders are the fastest non-electronic deposit method for CampBX. Please write your CampBX login name, registered email ID, and full address on your Money Order.
Money Orders without proper "From" address cannot be accepted due to compliance requirements
Please make your deposit payable to Bulbul Investments LLC and mail it to us at:
      Bulbul Investments LLC
      13010 Morris Rd, Bldg 1 Suite

      USA
TL;DR: It's a paper money order, just like you buy at Walmart or the bank.  You mail it.

Nope, sorry.  You can mail checks (with verification first).  You can mail money orders (more anon if you lie about details).  Or you can use Dwolla (with Dwolla verification and a bank account). 
I use Dwolla.  Verification with them takes a couple days, where Mt Gox took weeks for me and Virwox keeps you on probation for months and has terrible fees.  Bank transfers to Dwolla take several business days, but Dwolla transfers to CampBX are pretty quick. 
As a P.S., I love CampBX.  They've been stable the whole time I've used them, while MtGox went down a dozen times.  Fees are decent.  I just wish they had a larger client base for liquidity's sake.

So I guess this all works by keeping the look of the site alive, while the secure functions are blocked due to the DDOS or maintenance or breakdown?
