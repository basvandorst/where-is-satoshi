I had bit of fiat leftover in my GDAX from some recent ETH and LTC transactions and decided to jump in at 19400 -- against my better judgement of buying at an ATH. 
Get ready for a dip, guys.

No one knows what's going to happen. What seems likely is that this is just normal market movement. The market is at ridiculous levels compared only to a few days ago and now it has slowed down a bit. It's not surprising to see controlled selloffs happening right now. I'd expect that it will start to rise again in a couple of hours or days -- provided this selloff doesn't spark a panic (and it really shouldn't, or the market is on stupidly unstable ground).

When you have a large number of people who are willing to sell at a particular price, you get what is referred to as a "sell wall." In order to increase the price, you need to decrease the supply can be obtained at that price. This means a large number of people willing to sell at a particular price presents a barrier to the price increasing beyond it.

They aren't doing great (other than BCH), that's true. But many are doing better than BTC right now. Overall, I've made BTC these past few days, even if I've lost USD -- meaning that my alts definitely helped me minimize those losses.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:38:39
Damn, that looks amazing. I wish that ledger could do that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:33:11
But it is growing, isn't it? And all things considered, it's growing pretty quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:23
As great as the One True Bitcoin may be, this is a pretty good lesson about the importance of diversifying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:43:20
General instability and FUD -- especially with the BCH fiasco -- leading to a lack of confidence and panic.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:59:46
Heeere we go!
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:33:54
Yeah, I know, but it's one thing in computer science and another thing when everyone is buying things with them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:00:15
And that's easy to see on a bitcoin enthusiast forum like this. But make no mistake, the majority of money invested in bitcoin (not necessarily the majority of *people* who invest) is done with an eye to making more of it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:43
Nope. You're good.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:54:37
Their transaction system is suffering right now. I'm still waiting on a transfer from GDAX from 5 hours ago. Hang tight.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:01:18


lol. It may be a bubble, but try 2008 on for size.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:26:32
I know it's tempting, but there is a future in some alt coins (even if I'm not the biggest fan of LTC), and having a diverse portfolio is pretty key to maximizing gains and minimizing losses.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:17
No one knows, man.
What do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:21:09
Always transfer to GDAX instead of going directly out of Coinbase, it reduces your fees enormously.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:53:59
Market manipulation, lack of trust, lots of new money coming in, and lots of old money going out. Really, though, it's an unregulated market with no clear "value."
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:37:55
Personally, I just can't get over how "bit" sounds when speaking French.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:10
Only on the USD. Not on the value of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:41:39
Yeah, I can definitely second Delta. I find it much nicer than Blockfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:19
If you throw it hard enough, even a dad rat will bounce.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:21
Because you're holding on to an asset that will -- apparently -- decrease by over a third in value? The smart move would be to sell now and buy it all back at the "bottom."
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:00:59
Holy fuck. 
For better or for worse, bitcoin will never be the same again... Unless it is.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:06:22


I think the other poster may have misunderstood this question. You do not need another wallet other than a hardware wallet, if you don't want. You can buy on an exchange and send directly to your hardware wallet, if you so choose.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:26:57
SELL EVERYTHING OH MY GOD SELL IT NOW HOLY SHIT IT'S GOING TO ZERO!!!! SELL SELL SELL SELL SELLSELLLLLLLLLL
Cmon, man. Have some testicular fortitude and go do something productive. Check back in a week if you can't handle the stress.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:21:52
While multiples of "starting price" may be an interesting statistic, it's hardly a good standard to measure the economic fallout of a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:27
God I fucking love this thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:58
Probably not a bad bet. Is it worth getting emotionally invested in a community squabble to the point of putting it before your finances?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:55:51
No one really knows. Most of the people on this sub believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and sometimes other crypto currency. It's really up to you to do research and to decide for yourself. Either way, the truth is that, despite the stability of the past day or so, crypto currency is extremely volatile -- even if it has been on a strong upward climb recently. If everyone who believes in Bitcoin is wrong (and tbh, no one really knows), you could lose everything. That's why it's essential to invest in crypto in an intelligent manner. Only invest what you can -- reasonably -- afford to lose, and don't try to day or swing trade if you don't know what you're doing. That means that you just need to buy and let your investment sit. The short-term value is of no consequence. The only thing that matters is the value at your goal date -- years from now.

Looks to me like this is a pretty controlled dump: sell, let it rise, sell, repeat. Anyone have other thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:47
Buckle up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:58:58
Sure, that may even be true for most *people* (even though I doubt that), but what's important is that the majority of new *money* is speculation. It's the whales and investment groups that control the market, and they are here to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:51:36
Dude. If you're stressing, you're doing it wrong. It's a volatile market. Unless you are *deliberately* playing the highs and lows (in which case you know what you're doing)... **STOP PANICKING!** 
Put your coin in a wallet (off exchange) and go do something productive with your life. Unless you truly feel that this is a bubble about to pop (in which case, gtfo now), then this just part of the natural ebbing and flowing of a market. Chill.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:57:59
Yeah, I've been waiting a while on a withdrawal as well. Just gotta give it some time, I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:19:29
What's your definition of crap? There are definitely some that are established and rising in value and use like LTC and ETH. And then others that are up-and-coming and really interesting such as XRP and IOTA. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:09:24
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:55:17
Speculation, dude. That's how it works.
There might be a long-term potential for Bitcoin, especially with LN on the horizon, but right now, this is totally -- 100% -- due to speculation. Maybe someday we "won't need" to cash out to fiat, but that doesn't change that fact that almost all new money is speculation on future prices.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:11:07
If you really thought that, you'd sell everything.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:51
Buy in today and then again if it dips, if you want. You'll never beat a market by trying to outsmart it -- just gotta ride it. Sometimes you'll lose money, and sometimes you'll make it. In the case of BTC, people have been doing a lot of the latter recently.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:29:03
Exactly, this isn't WSB. You don't *really* ever get to choose when you buy.
 Real sound investment strategy isn't trying to beat the market by buying low and selling high. It's all about maximizing gains and minimizing losses -- which is the reason why a diverse index-type fund is just about the best any person can ever reasonably hope for when investing. 
If you want to make money, you shouldn't plan on BTC being higher than an imaginary future low, but rather hope that the market will carry it higher than it is when you buy it. Note that the second is a much more likely outcome than the first, because the first requires both a drop that may never happen, and a recovery -- which may also never really happen if it's a complete bubble. 
The second, though, only requires that growth continue at a steady (even numerically unimpressive) rate.
Edit: Basically, don't think about short-term growth. You have much more liberty to choose a good time to sell than you do a good time to buy, so keep that in mind. Buy and hold, don't wait to buy -- doing that only works out for the very very lucky ones, and statistically, you (or any one else) are probably not one.

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:01:26


Great. Thanks.


Fuck no. Do not go all in on BTC. Don't even go all in on Crypto. Diversify, diversify, diversify.


  


Obviously not. You're just hoping for a lucky break. It ain't gonna happen for you kid. 


Don't have faith. Make reasonable and diversified investment. Bitcoin is just one part of that.
But you do you dude. I'll see you on the moon.
Edit: Actually I'm waiting for a dip in the market to invest in my 401K. Don't want to get in on a high lololol. (Catch my drift?)
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:45
Oh fuck.
