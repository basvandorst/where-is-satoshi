dude i just paid 4$ to send (edited $400) worth of bitcoin the other day... sooooo idgaf about roger... i want my fucking fees  lower and the time shortened. end of story.

@_date: 2017-04-16 20:55:29
you know what? you are right. it was a $400 and the fee was $3.72
my bad.. so it was less than 1%.. oops
so replace everything i said with the same thing but different number. fuck you... 1% transaction fee... AND it takes hours to go through... no thanks. lmk when these dickswingers stop arguing and actually fix something that clearly has been broken for some time and is just now showing it. until then, bitcoin is friendster
do you still want to see the screen?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:14:33
Step 1: Decide if you trust Bitcoin to be a good enough(for you) long term investment. If so, continue to Step 2.
Step 2: Buy Bitcoin and store it somewhere that isn't Coinbase or an online wallet, and if you still choose to do this take all of the necessary and extraordinary precautions. Hardware with backups is best way to store, though.
Step 3: Make secure backups of all wallet info on separate mediums/devices. AND REMEMBER WHERE!
It is this simple.
That last part is all you. For all we know an entire blockchain era will have risen and faltered into a new one by then. I still am not sure Bitcoin will be the top coin by the end of the year.

im not entirely convinced it will.. or that bitcoin is even worth it by then because of its changes from original code by core. i didnt say satoshis identity is needed...

HAHA.. ummm.... thats just totally not fucking true. literally every day i come on here one of the top five posts is some kind of angry post about Jihan, Roger or one of their "shills" and usually it provides no new evidence just a venting of anger
jesus christ.. i honestly cant believe someone said this
@_date: 2017-04-23 09:36:46
can we attribute some of the rise in bitcoin price to this exact scenario? if so, that would suggest bitcoin is still mostly stagnant. if THATS the case then i suggest investing in litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-19 02:58:03
thank you for posting. lots of useful info here
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:01:49
To answer your first question, I don't know from experience but i know they make very good wallets from what I've read.
The second question has a lot to do with how fast these coins are developing and how many new coins are becoming more and more credible.
The most likely scenario I see IF Bitcoin does lose its top spot is due to the seemingly endless amount of coins that are popping up and actually getting a sizeable share of the market. This will make it easier for coins that are runners up to sneak up to it.
Not to mention the $4 fee i just paid to send bitcoin to an exchange to buy doge
Bitcoin might not have the worst problems of the top coins but its definitely the most paid attention to, the most public and the most important to the market.
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:15:06
they have the most straight forward and noob friendly GUI ive used. they def have a place in the industry until some of these exchanges start waking up to why people are willing to use coinbase even though it has terrible customer service
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:11:55
how long do you expect that doubling to last?
also, consider bitcoin has lost a ton of market share already to this bullshit so you have to consider how much traffic we would have if we did this right away... that "doubling" would be almost useless after a small amount of time and im not impressed by that prospect.
SURE DO IT... DEF... but for real? doubling? thats it?

right but ultimately this comes down to ISP's not throwing down the money for infrastructure even though they get tax breaks under the assumption they will. they dont because their margins of profit are higher if they work together to slow it down rather than compete and have to work harder for less money.
same goes for hard drives.
the tech is there for them to upgrade but they have a motive of profit to make as much as they can from each level of tech they have a patent on. which causes them to stifle future tech breakthroughs to make money with tech thats still becoming popular. greed is literally destroying innovation
so this is a practical solution to a problem that is created by greed and corruption. block size increase works in theory because it makes sense for progress... but large corporations dont want progress.

in an evolving industry with exponential growth and advancements in tech i think this statement you made is so silly within this context. but i agree with you on the larger point. but its just like the articles of confederation to me. the second version will be better
edit: whatever version this is &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:52:00
ive never had one problem with coinbase and every bit of crypto ive bought came from BTC on that site. but so far every other site ive ever used ive had problems with, from exchanges all the way to steemit... so its subjective aspparently

so are you going to address all the examples of this being not true that i ~~cited~~? (edit:MENTIONED)
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:32:12
true.. i guess not that many people were watching... more people probably saw the picture in the context we saw it, being subscribed to subreddits involving bitcoin, than saw it on tv that never see anything about bitcoin. so i think ur point makes sense... but im also surprised that the downturn is continuing. i assume a bunch of the larger institutions are climbing down with their profits as they are used to single digit profits being good. what they consider a big gain in investments we consider almost nothing as normal crypto investors. so i imagine almost all of the companies that invested earlier this year and last year would want to take these astronomical profits... but theyre such large whales that even a slow gradual sell would have drastic effects on the economy. and its exponential as each entity watches their potential profits slowly shrink. im rambling and need food.. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:51:49
the simple fact that you compared it to tech THAT old proves my point
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:31:04
i dont have any skills that people pay in bitcoin for. im learning solidity now and its hard without a base programming knowledge, so maybe in the future sure.
i dont even know anyone in real life who even knows what bitcoin is
however i will try bitsquare next time i make a large purchase because i actually have never used them before

the idea that those are the only two polar opposite options in your head that you go to first make me think you dont know the essence of the issue here or the actual point we are trying to make and just getting defensive
@_date: 2017-05-03 09:36:52
ok, heres the problem in regards to the washington example.
you didnt provide evidence. often no one ever does.
you stated evidence that was written down and given to you by a team of scientists through some sort of journal.
this is the problem we have... 
im not saying your point is invalid or this isnt true, im saying anyone can say something isnt true and not be irrational until its literally demonstrated in front of them.
"if we cant trust scientists then who can we trust"
i agree.. except we cant trust all scientists. cannabis is one of the best medicines on the planet. literally replaces half of all pharmaceuticals. go find a book written before the millennium that contains cannabis and states its positive effects. shit  go fin one that mentions it all. go look at al the drugs that have been recalled and how many of them have "peer reviewed studies" deeming them safe.
(we can probably trust the information of washingtons teeth because theres not much a reason to lie about it, imo)
i agree 100% with your point and sentiments.. im just saying that its not irrational to not believe authority or elite culture.
have some sympathy for those who have lost faith in humanity.. they are hardened from knowledge thats difficult to live with
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:59:01

both sides are full of shit on different levels.. everyone keeps talking about jihans money incentive and its an un-impressive argument.
also, dont we have some of the old school devs saying many of the newer devs cant be trusted?
i just dont buy this whole "one side is right and one side is wrong" rhetoric.
personally i think its similar (not the same) to the democarats vs republicans. both cant be trusted, but theres a clear choice for better survival chances

i dont use bitcoin for anything but buying crypto now. when i transfer money i make sure i do it in a way that is NOT bitcoin wherever possible... "willing to pay"? really? .. more like "HAVE TO PAY"
rope you in with easy access and then when you become dependant, up the price.... hmm what does that sound like?
im not saying i disagree with what you are saying in general, i dont. im saying this one statement is missing some perspective.. i dont see it as people willing to pay, i see it as people having no choice in some cases and when they do they choose something else. hence the altcoin explosion
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:09:33

i didnt say you NEED it to do shady shit, nor did i say or agree that it was created for that purpose, but that doesnt stop people like steve bannon from saying how much he loves it and therefore putting a stigma onto it.
btw, while i agree with the theoretical point, i have yet to be shown data proving the people we dont catch are less successful at theft and shady activity than conventional means at this point in time.
