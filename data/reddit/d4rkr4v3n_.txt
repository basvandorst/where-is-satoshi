\&gt;  why not instead sell and buy the dip? 
It's not that easy though. I sold and took profits at 6K. I wish I'd held the portion I'd sold and was selling it now for 9K+. And again, if I'd sold at 9K I'd be wishing I'd sold at 12K+. Taking profits is good, but if you're not overly invested and can afford to hold long-term, you're in the best possible position.
Trading comes with all sorts of risks. I could have had some extra BTC right now, if I'd held, and they'd be worth a decent amount more even with the current correction.

2017 bullrun saw multiple dips just like this one. Whales start selling, weak (new) hands start selling, bot stop-losses come into effect like dominos. And then a retrace happens. If I remember right, when Eth dipped down to something like $7 from a $13 high it took nearly or maybe just over 60 days for it to reach that price point again, and then it was $17, $19, $23, $50 over another 60 or so days. Then Eth mooned to 1K. 
That said, I'm not wealthy by any means and these dips hit me right in the gut. Iron hands. Holding. 100K EOY.

I'm a little older, in the middle of buying my first home and holding a good professional position in my company. And I'm neglecting my work and my health because all I do is watch the charts, waiting to catch that next 85% pump.
Next pump I'm planning on cashing out 50%, holding the rest and just forgetting about it. Crypto is a strange beast. Where you can make more money in a day than you might make in 3 months of work - and then feel disappointed that you only made 3 months of salary in a 24 hour period because if you had held a little longer you could have made 6 months worth of salary.
And then you feel bad about it. You make all this money, and you feel horrible about it. It's messing up my life.

Yeah, especially when there are bills to pay and things like that. Suddenly, I go from looking at my BTC as a savings/investment account to gambling money that could all be squandered in the immediate to medium term when it potentially is a huge fallback option.
I know it's not smart to "over invest" (or gamble?) but the allure is so strong with crypto. It only takes one good pump to become obsessed. An 85% gain in 24 hours has had me hooked since. I've watched it go up, and then I've held, held, held all the way back down.

In 346 days and 15 hours 1 BTC will be worth about $75'000USD. But when it is worth that much, less people than you might imagine will be selling for USD because value will increasingly be measured in sats.
