That's how economics works though. Something is worth whatever it trades for. What you've described is a cartel. If everyone holding BTC tomorrow refused to sell for less than 100k, it would of course sell for that price. This could lead to a new high, it could also lead to the collapse of BTC since it's just as likely people who currently use BTC for real world transactions might find such a sudden jump to be worth the hassle of switching to an altcoin. My crystal ball isn't good enough to guess which of those scenarios might play out, but we'll never find out anyway because there is enough supply that there are plenty of people who will be willing to part with their stash for the already impressive capital growth they have seen so far.
Right now people are buying bitcoin for a few reasons, but here are the two that matter the most in my opinion:
1. to spend it. This is the eventual goal of crypocurrencies, to be useful as a store of value. Being able to purchase goods and services is the keystone holding everything up
2. Speculation. People have varying levels of confidence that the first factor will occur and BTC will become a widely accepted way to conduct financial transactions. Some people are hoping that BTC will skyrocket in its intrinsic value and want to ride that wave for personal gain. The collector could tell the second person they're foolish and should hold on for a better price, but the intrinsic value is different for the two people.
Another angle to consider. If someone owns a 1979 Chevy Nova and thinks it's going to be a collectors item some day, they would probably not sell it at a low price. Someone else who owns the same vehicle as a daily driver might very well be willing to part with it at a discount.

Jokes aside, the NSA did in fact sneak weaknesses into encryption algorithms disguising them as features. We learned this as part of the Snowden leak
It's possible someone has hidden something malicious in Bitcoin, though they'd have to be very sneaky to do so.

There might not be "one global coin," but there will most likely be a very small subset of the current players in existence once things shake out. The current leader could just as likely vanish as it could continue its dominance.
It is of course not an identical analogy, but it is curious how the first in a breakthrough technology often end up disappearing. No one owns an Altair brand gaming rig or drives a Duryea Motor Wagon Company car.

That argument supports his point though. You're looking back withe some pretty strong survivorship bias. What happened to AltaVista, GeoCities, or onsale.com? They were strong competitors to the three companies you list, but none of them exist any more. 
Sometimes there's a good idea that takes off like the Internet. You can have the right idea at the wrong time, like WebVan, who wanted to offer same day delivery services similar to what Amazon is starting to implement now. Amazon, on the other hand started off selling only books online, nothing else. As people began to trust the Internet more, they grew into the behemoth they are now. WebVan looked like the star quarterback in the 90s and Amazon was the nerdy kid in the library. Some people got in and out of WebVan before the bust and made a fortune. Which was the better long term investment?
Cryptocurrencies are probably here to stay, but when they reach the point that they're ready for mass use will the dominant player be the main player currently (bitcoin,) or will a smaller competitor win out in the long run? It's even possible that the eventual leader hasn't been invented yet.

Drugs.  
I don't mean that as a statement about whether drugs are good or bad, but because of the decentralized nature of the system, they're perfectly suited to being a payment vehicle for illegal activity.

We measure the stability of currencies relative to what can be purchased with those currencies, and compare the purchasing power of currencies over the long term.  All currencies fluctuate, the BTC is fluctuating wildly right now compared to purchasable goods and services.

Don't do anything until the exchange rates stabilize.  I'm going to avoid inserting my personal opinion about whether or not Bitcoins were overvauled here.  Your calculations will be totally pointless if BTCs are selling for $2 in a month, and they'll be similarly useless if it shoots back up to $250.

Are you looking to get into this because you believe in the concept, or because you hope to make a profit?  I guess this is the part where my personal opinions will become a little more obvious.   People who were going to cash in on Bitcoins already have.  You're already too late if you want to become a Bitcoin millionaire.  
It's still entirely possible that Bitcoin could still become a viable currency though, but not with the kind of volatility you're seeing.

We can debate all day whether or not Bitcoin is overvalued, but your post is.  I predict a crash when your post corrects back to 10 things instead of 12. ;)

The answer is very complicated.  The short answer for anyone looking to build an exchange is to hire a good tax attorney.

The medium length answer (in the US) is that profits to the business would be taxed in the normal fashion for the manner in which the company is structured.  Any proceeds to clients that result in a profit must be properly documented with a 1099 and submitted to the IRS according to current statute (for example, depending on the amount earned, you may not need to report.)
The long answer is to read current tax law, don't forget to cover the Sarbanes Oxley Act.  A lot of the stuff in there can land CEOs in "federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison" if you run afoul of them.  I'm not sure how else to emphasize that you NEED a lawyer to set up such a business.  SOX alone is 66 pages, and there are dozens of other laws to consider.

Most people aren't saying Bitcoin is a joke.  Most people are saying that four digit figure percentage gains with nothing to back it = bubble.  Housing crashed for the same reasons, people got into it wanting to make a quick buck rather than a sound investment.

Austrian economics has its proponents, but there really aren't very many peer reviewed papers coming from Austrian economists.  Proponents would argue that the establishment is too unwilling to hear out their arguments, most economists would argue that the theories don't stand up to scrutiny.  It's a cop out to expect a layperson to devote study to something that most experts in the field dismiss.

How'd that work out for the Madoff shareholders?

I like to consider myself a contrarian investor.  I've done alright with the philosophy you mention (20% yearly growth recently, closer to 10% since I started investing,) but that doesn't mean that you can just blindly cling to your favorite pet vehicle.  Sometimes the value just isn't there and you have to cut your loses.  If you're going to invest with this kind of strategy, always decide where you want to cut and run, and have a standing stop-loss order.
