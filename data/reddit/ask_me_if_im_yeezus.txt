9 days ago you said you were new to crypto. You know we can see your comment history, right? I know you’ve only been on Reddit for a month.

Right. Just think: what’s more harmful? People using crypto or people smuggling little kids so evil men can have sex with them?

I appreciate people wanting to learn new things. I like when people are interested in a new field; researching and reading, asking questions, etc. 
What I don’t appreciate are asshats like this clown who just started crypto acting like we’re the fools.

Will this have an impact on long term investment? If so, when should I switch to another cyrpto?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:25:14
I'm doing this with a very small investment, hope it pays off but if not I won't be too mad.

Yo have you been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC? It's fucking GIGANTIC and so many pieces were donated by JP Morgan. I mean, yeah fuck a bank, and the system, all that, but the dude donated so much priceless art to the public. Probably the first and only good thing I think about when I hear "JP Morgan".
