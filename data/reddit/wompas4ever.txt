Well belief is all we have to hold on to for now. Till bitcoin becomes more wide spread and used for tangible goods and services, all you can do is believe.

Down :(
But it'll come back around. I don't feel as if we are far enough out from the bubble for people to continue paying $100ish per coin. I would, but as a whole, I don't know.

Pathetic isn't it...
No but I have accounts with Mt Gox, Bitcoin24 and CampBX, I just have been watching to see how trust worthy these companies. I almost bought in through Mt Gox in February, but the varification process took to long and I did somethinking about the whole idea of Bitcoins in that time. Buy the time I could buy in I didn't want to through Mt Gox and bitcoins were approaching 60 bucks and it overall just sounded less appealing, so I decided to just wait on it and it seems as though sanity have found its way back. You can't be too safe.

I'm probably going to go with CampBX. I'm going to looking to making cash deposits via Bank of America. I'm also trying Bitcoin local seeing what that can work out for me.

Thanks much for a direct answer. I'll definitely look into that. I think this seems like more of what I'm looking for.

I'm in it for the long hall. I don't picture bitcoins truely becoming a thing for 5-15 years in all reality. I was just gonna sit on this maybe pick up some more over the years.

It would, that may be a few years off but I don't doubt it one day it could hit that mark. It has some proving to do.

This is a good point. I hear you out. I do not plan on transferring my bitcoins into USD once they are BTC. So from my point of view I am contributing to the system. And I will spend them, just not soon. There is nothing wrong with saving money, why is there something wrong with saving BTC? There is too many logistics to be worked out and not enough people offering goods or services I want for BTC. If a good or service is offered for a reasonable BTC and I want it enough I will spend my BTC, we just need to get to that point.

I'm in no rush, I don't picture it hiting 200 soon, I hope it doesn't. I hope for a natural growth of bitcoins that is legitimately stable, so its can grow as a currency.
