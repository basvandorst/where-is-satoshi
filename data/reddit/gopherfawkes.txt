Better than my negative 5500....
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:42:31
Just from looking at the charts, I'm expecting pretty big rally at some point from now til tomorrow morning USA time.
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:40:31
I honestly didn't think we'd see prices under 9k again after last week, figured it was the floor, even though I'm disappointed that it wasn't the case, I'm also happy that this might allow me get more btc for cheap as I work towards owning 2 full btc
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:55:59
I'm ok with this, I get paid friday and was planning on buying $750 more so this allows me to buy cheaper btc. I dont want btc to rise too fast too soon, want to hold as much btc as possible before we head to the moon
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:56:24
Here we go ladies and gentlemen, hope y'all listened to my comment earlier and bought more while you still can
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:19:29
[So far, going as predicted, hope y'all didn't miss out](
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:38:17
Up 2% since last week
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:10:31
For God sake people this is the same shit that happened last week and it was even s bigger drop than this, we made it out fine. Pretty sure most of these panic posters are just trolls anyways but I just don't want others to panic because of these trolls. We are still hoovering around 9000, we'll be fine, just be like me and see it as a buying opportunity. I have invested over 25k in btc and still want to invest more before we go to the moon, so slow rise is what I'm hoping for anyways.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:48:06
Getting BTC spread out across many entities and away from small amount of entities is the best thing long term for BTC, unless that 1 entity is me.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:12:45
Just doing what I can to help the Community. Not all heros wear caps, but I do though because I look damn fine with one
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:04:13
Likely never seeing btc under 9k ever again. We'll be saying that about 10k soon
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:33:38
Doubt it will ever get that low again. This rise is all because of people who actually believe in btc and aren't in it to make quick buck, once btc hits mainstream again that's when you really need to be careful, as for now, I'd say you should buy, don't see it getting below 9k again, that's the new support floor, there will be long period of Bart at around 10k, but if you are in it for long haul still good time to buy
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:00:08
Couldn't there still be credit cards for crypto? There is still gonna be a need for borrowing regardless
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:56:53
You are supposed to buy more before you get back to even to lower your cost basis and get back to even faster. Congrats on your milestone, I still got ways to go but not too worried about it, in fact hoping for slow rise so I can buy even more cheap btc
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:59:54
I'd be all over these prices if I had the money, sadly my student loans are due for this paycheck so can't take advantage
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:37:07
All my models say that USA will be pretty happy when they wake up tomorrow
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:05:21
Alright I'll bight, What is phase E?
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:56:04
Really hope we can stay under 10k for at least another 2 weeks (payday), I need to buy more cheap btc 
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:21:51
Pay day this Friday, which will also be may 4th, should see a big jump on Friday, and likely a jump tomorrow as well in anticipation of said jump, so get ahead of them all and buy btc today, I just bought $800 worth.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:20:23
I hear that, I've been buying $750 worth every paycheck, currently at a little more than 1.5 btc, would love to double that before we reach the moon but money isn't coming in fast enough. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:54:07
Less mining would mean less supply though right?  Honestly don't know why this matters regardless, I'm pretty sure the market is basing everything as if there are 21mil btc anyways, we all know this is the limit, doubt that forecast is the reason unless people are extremely dumb and don't understand how this works
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:17:55
I am in the red by $15,000(years worth of savings) because I didn't buy until it's highs because I was dumb and didn't listen 2 years ago to my friend and bought then. I am now just all in with it, if I lose it all, I lose it all. Just gonna pretend that money doesn't even exist and if it ever gets to the point of where we are all hoping it goes then it'll be nice little surprise for me. 
15 grand is a lot for me right now but come around retirement time, my portfolio can easily go down that much in a day with the stock market. So that is how I'm coping with this, also porn.
@_date: 2018-03-12 04:10:21
Can't argue with anything he said today, it's mostly stuff everyone on here knew already but he brought to light to the main stream
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:44:44
I don't get why people are so hung up on btc needing to be the world's only currency instead of just one of many currencies. Frankly it's just outlandish to believe this, I mean sizable part of the world's  population doesn't even have access to the internet. If it becomes a currency that all major institutions accept, then I'll be happy. I see btc being more like digital gold right now.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:02:01
You're comparing percentages, I'm comparing whole dollar amounts. When hopefully my portfolio is 1mil or more around retirement age, if the stock market drops 1.5%(which happens from time to time during a trading session) that's 15k. So losing 15k now sucks but when it's out of a million it sucks a little less, so that's how I am coping with current losses.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:28:11
God this sub feels like t_d sometimes, would love for some actual intelligent discussion on here for once.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:37:08
Right now I see btc similar to gold, it has value, but you can't buy groceries with it. This whole idea that the whole world will ONLY be using Bitcoin is outlandish, and frankly I don't think it needs to be, as long as it is accepted as a currency by major institutions it'll be fine, but that's the major hump right now.
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:20:26
But why would anyone sell their Bitcoin for their useless currency?
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:34:15
Hope everyone else sold like I did after seeing this post, shits dropping hardcore right now
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:57:44
still alive and kicking, more to life than money!
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:06:23
I sold after our most recent bull run at around 8500, bought back in at around $6500 was able to afford 2 BTC now without adding any Fiat thanks to the bear run, now let's ride Bulls!
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:45:30
they started this whole shit
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:55:43
I invested another 750 dollars last week by going into my savings figuring that I can replace that savings with my upcoming check which is tomorrow, would it be crazy to invest another 750, with the thought process that I can replace that with the check after that?
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:53:54
Noob question, There seems to be big resistance wall at 9300-9400. When that goes down does that mean there will be a pretty good resistance at the same point in the other direction? Seemed to have been case at 8700-8800, but not sure if that is by concidence or if that is how math works out.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:43:41
This might be a stupid question, but what is the advantage/disadvantage of investing in a fund like GBTC instead of directly into Bitcoin?
My friend does it this way and he says he prefers it this way because it's traded on the stock exchange so it's less shady and it allows you to do it in tax advantage retirement accounts. Only downside he says is that can only trade when market is open but not a big deal if you in it for the long haul.
Is he right? Is there something else he's missing?
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:25:48
Chart experts, what y'all forcasting?
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:55:04
If I was living paycheck to paycheck i probably wouldn't have $1,000 available after get paid to spend on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 03:02:59
Don't trust any coin that isn't Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:05:02
Just bought $750 worth, so I got 75 people covered
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:56:47
Asia started it
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:06:46
Guys...what am I supposed to do with my hands in these exciting times
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:59:59
the problem with bitcoin is a lot people who dont know how investing works are in this market, they expect it to only go up or only down, which is not the case in any market, but they don't understand, so when they see it go down a bit everyone panics and what should be a small dip turns into a crash, same thing in other direction, people see it go up and they all jump on because they don't want to miss out. People need to learn that time in the market is much better than timing the market. If you truly believe in what your investing in, then buy it and don't worry about short term numbers, but its hard to not worry about short term numbers when the masses move the market so much because they are too reactionary instead of longing like they should be
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:46:40
I always saw 6k as the floor that's why I wanted to invest as much as can at that price to hopefully make up my losses quicker but now I'm worried to invest, literally has gone down at every point I have bought, including 7300 lol
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:26:04
Here we go boys, here's that 8800 resistance we were all expecting. Let's go bulls! We got this shit
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:03:07
Wall finally gave way 
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:45:55
I have spent about 25k on btc over the past 4-5 months and my current holdings is valued at 16-17k, let's say I sold my entire holdings, is that enough to make a significant impact on the price?
I have no plans to sell btw, just wondering how much of an impact my holdings would create
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:14:58
Massive dip coming according to the charts, you've been warned
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:08:25
Gotta go big if you want a lambo
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:17:06
I've been consistently putting in $750 every 2 weeks into btc. I gotta feeling we're heading to the Moon, would be crazy to dip into my emergency fund to get in before it's too late, and just replace my emergency fund money and just replace it down the line with the $750 contribution in was planning on putting in btc?
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:30:36
The people who didn't sell are more likely to hold around ath because they don't panic sell, at least their actions would lead you to believe that. They'll be one of the 1st to sell though once they see btc start heading down as they likely learned from their "mistake"
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:02:51
Alright guys, not much time left to get yourself 4 figure btc, don't miss out on your likely last chance in history of being able to get it this low
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:14:40
Why would anyone attempt to short anything when it has this type of momentum, shouldn't they all wait til the momentum tails off
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:08:33
So glad I dipped into my savings again for another $750 to put into btc yesterday.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:15:14
All the experts who are good at reading the charts, how's it looking? When's the next resistance point? Should I buy more btc now or wait a little?
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:22:42
Need it to stay at around these prices for awhile so I can buy more at under 10k
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:32:29
I made almost as much today with btc as my take home paycheck for work. Maybe it's time to retire and have btc be my job/hobby, or I'll just wait til I'm back in the green first(only $8,000 to go!)
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:02:35
9400 is going to be hard to crack
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:57:38
Even in a bull run there will be bearish days, don't be alarmed over 1 bad day, if you try to time out the market you'll likely miss out on gains, just sit tight and you'll be fine in the long run
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:07:06
Lost/missed out on 2500 because I didn't Hudl, don't make the same mistake I made, trying to time the market is for suckers
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:49:24
What is everyones yearly salary, how much have you invested in btc, and how much is it currently worth?
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:11:56
We are going to be stuck at current price levels for a few days. That gives everyone some time to check their couch cushions for anything you can put towards btc. I'm currently in the process of selling my winter beater(my 2nd car) and all that money is going into btc. Let's go bulls!
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:17:05
What are y'all forcasting those of you who are pretty good at reading the charts
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:51:27
no way to tell for sure, $8.8K is the key support point, it'll depend on how well that holds up, if bears get passed that we are gonna be in bad shape
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:51:39
I make around 50k a year, have invested 23k and it's currently worth about 14-15k lol. I am not worried though! I pump more into it when ever I can to get back to the green quicker! I've got my lambo already picked out!
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:18:28
Just a dip in the crypto world, anything up or down 5% is considered flat
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:51:16
In 1969 we made it to the Moon, but space shuttles still "liftoff" even though they don't go as far anymore. Down the line we will make it as far as the Moon again and even further, but in the mean time, it will take many "liftoffs" before we can make those historic achievements reality.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:53:58
A lot of people on here are spoiled brats who have no idea how markets work, btc is up quite a bit from yesterday, yet people are bitching because it went down a little in the past hour? Every investment/currency goes up and down, the key is going up more than you go down, if you are gonna freak out every time it goes down, than you shouldn't be investing in anything, let alone crpto where the swings are a lot larger.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:11:38
Today is also my payday, I usually put in $750 every paycheck but for past 2 pay periods I've been just dipping into my savings to get ahead of everyone else and using the $750 from my paycheck to replenish my savings.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:11:03
hopefully at least long enough until I get paid on friday
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:43:27
Was waiting for today(payday) to buy $1000 worth more of Bitcoin but of course it goes up a bunch, and every time I have bought in the past it goes down. Should I still risk it and buy at current price? 
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:09:07
Who says I've ever sold? I have never sold, I just bought at wrong times because it always goes down when I buy, I have put around 25k in btc and it's currently valued at little under 15k, all I've done is buy to try dig myself out of red quicker, just been pumping money in at wrong times, in the long term I'm still confident but still sucks to be in the red by so much in the meantime
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:35:18
Alot of people were complaining that they needed more time to get I before btc took off again, well now is your time folks. 
For those worried that btc dropped, even in a bull run there will be bear days, if you can't handle that than you shouldn't be investing your money in anything
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:18:11
9400 another barrier we need to break through then it's 10k barrier
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:13:29
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for liftoff.

Not cool asia
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:08:23
Yeah bulls have sharpened their horns and are out in full force, get out of the bears or die on impact!
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:46:55
yup, so its not flat, its a dip, once it gets 25% or more its a crash
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:16:36
He never said breeze, just that the next major resistance is at $8,800, you still need buyers to get up to that point.
