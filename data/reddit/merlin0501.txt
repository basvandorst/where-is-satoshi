My guess would be normal statistical variation.
There don't appear to have been any dramatic changes in hashrate:

over the past few days.
Also it might make more sense to post this in r/dashpay

I'm not familiar with veracrypt specifically but generally disk encryption only really protects your data when the disk is offline or the computer is shut down.  When the disk is mounted the data is available in cleartext to any program running on the machine and hence is vulnerable to hacking.

That's been my point all along.  It's value is tied to how much it's used as a medium of exchange and the recent price stability is associated with lack of growth in that use (ie. transaction volume).
@_date: 2016-04-08 22:43:09
In the US I suspect that lot's of people and especially businesses are afraid to touch it because of the excessive and unclear regulations.
EDIT: Take for instance the NY bitlicense.  Even the way it is formulated seems designed to scare people away.  It starts off by requiring the bitlicense to do almost anything at all with bitcoin and then opens two probably very broad but far from clearly defined exceptions.  The US FinCEN regulations aren't much better with apparently very sweeping regulations that then seem to be limited by regulatory decisions on specific cases that seem to contradict the way most people would understand the regulations themselves.  Add to that media stories about people being prosecuted for bitcoin activities and it all starts to look like a government crackdown that is designed to destroy or severely limit bitcoin without outright banning it.  It's an underhanded form of tyranny that has become characteristic of how the US operates.

Gold's value isn't based on it's use as a medium of exchange though (at least not currently, though it was in the past).
I don't see how bitcoin has any value independent from it's use as a currency.  Sure you can say it can be used as a store of value like gold, but that's only true if there's some reason for bitcoins to have value in the first place.  I don't think people will find rare numbers intrinsically valuable.  This is different from gold which has both practical and artistic uses and a history of being considered valuable since the dawn of civilization.
@_date: 2016-04-09 01:51:20
Too much price stability at this point is not a positive sign.
With enough averaging to wash out the speculative bubbles and crashes it looks like price and transaction volume are roughly correlated, as one would expect.  I think neither has been growing very rapidly for the past 6-9 months (again averaging over all the spikes and dips) which suggests to me that we aren't seeing very widespread adoption.
@_date: 2016-04-09 10:01:47
But bitcoins don't store anything.  They're really just numbers.  Now either they have value or they don't.  I don't think a number, even a rare number that requires a lot of work to compute has any intrinsic value.  They can acquire value to the extent they are useful as a medium of exchange, I don't really see any other fundamental way to value them.

I think it would be interesting to see the same chart but with volume measured in BTC rather than in dollars.
@_date: 2015-12-05 09:33:26
You can certainly do that.  For example by running bitcoind on your own server and having the website call out to it over bitcoin core's RPC protocol.  Of course there are many possible security issues to think about in doing something like that (as there are with any form of payment).
Here is a link to a recent post that may provide some further information:
If you are asking about preexisting store front ends for this purpose, I don't have any information about that but it would surprise me if they didn't exist.  However even if you use such a preexisting solution you would need to think carefully about the security of the overall system.
@_date: 2015-12-05 09:39:24
It occurred to me that a web based store front would probably only need access to a small and relatively safe subset of the bitcoin core RPC interface (ie. generate addresses, query amounts and probably little else).  However if you give the store front access to RPC and the store front is hacked then it could do anything it wants with the online wallet.  It seems like it would be useful if there were a way, either within bitcoin core or using an intermediate gateway to restrict the set of allowed RPC commands, based on IP address or a user based privilege system.
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:38:00
If you're using a version of bitcoin core that's two or three years old it will be very out of date.  I'm not sure a version that old is even compatible with the current protocol and in any case newer versions have some features to speed up syncing.  You should upgrade to the latest version of bitcoin core (be sure to make a backup copy of wallet.dat before just in case something goes wrong).

As long as that number keeps changing you should be good, just let it run.  When it's done the message will disappear and there should be a green check mark in the lower right corner.

"It seems that the IRS/general legislation in the US (well New York at least) may be veering to stop people from trading BTC for USD "OTC" via localbitcoins or such and classing them as MSBs."
Do you have any concrete evidence for that claim ?
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:33:35
"Basically the bottom line is that if you sell Bitcoin, you are a money transmitter,"
This FINCEN ruling seems to dispute that claim:
Note this paragraph (and especially the last sentence):
"From time to time, as your letter has indicated, it may be necessary for a user to convert Bitcoin that it has mined into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, either because the seller of the goods or services the user wishes to purchase will not accept Bitcoin, or because the user wishes to diversify currency holdings in anticipation of future needs or for the user’s own investment purposes. In undertaking such a conversion transaction, the user is not acting as an exchanger, notwithstanding the fact that the user is accepting a real currency or another convertible virtual currency and transmitting Bitcoin, so long as the user is undertaking the transaction solely for the user’s own purposes and not as a business service performed for the benefit of another. A user’s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter."

I'm no fan of over-regulation by any means and your statements seem mostly accurate when applied to the Federal government.  But this is NYS we're talking about.

"Our servers begin to crash. It becomes apparent that BitcoinD is not well suited to crafting transactions of this size. "
What issues did you identify specifically with bitcoind not handling large transactions ?
Is it possible your servers simply didn't have enough memory for the task ?
Since most services probably depend on bitcoind it seems fairly likely that problems with them may have bitcoind's performance as their root cause.
I'm wondering if bitcoind itself has scalability issues or if people are running servers too small to cope with these kind of transaction volumes.
I was running a bitcoind node on a laptop yesterday and didn't notice any ill effects though.  Of course its unlikely my node saw your actual transactions but it certainly had to deal with the blocks that contain them.
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:45:11
If you're using Bitcoin Core as your wallet and it says "out of sync" you won't see any transactions appear until it has finished syncing, which can take days.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:22:28
Its theoretically possible of course but if you're talking about things like firmware hacks, unless the actual exploit code has been leaked it would still take a great deal of effort by very highly skilled people to deploy such a thing and you'd likely have to be targeted specifically.  Of course this state of affairs may change in the future so its definitely worth keeping an eye on the news but I wouldn't worry too much about it until you start hearing about attacks like this occurring in the wild.
Of course if you have really large amounts of bitcoin to protect its best to store them in a paper or other materialized wallet or at least an air gapped machine that never touches the internet (and be very careful with file transfer media) and securely delete any transferred wallet files from your online machines.

You'll need an asic miner, which is useless for anything else, to mine bitcoin.  I don't have any recommendations to offer on which ones are best at the moment but to estimate your daily return in bitcoins you should divide the miner's hash rate by the current total hashrate and multiply that ratio by 3600 (ie. 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours * 25 btc per block).  Also don't forget to consider your power costs and remember that the block reward will be divided by 2 sometime next year (though that may well increase the btc price so it may not affect your fiat return).
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:32:54
OK thanks for the clarification I was really having trouble making sense of this 1 line post.
So I guess the hope/expectation is that the "fee market" mechanism would kick in and raise the cost of such an attack to untenable levels.
One thing I'm not clear on (I'm still quite new to bitcoin) is whether the current software really supports this mechanism.  In particular what happens if I send a transaction with some fee and find it isn't getting confirmed in a reasonable amount of time.  Is there a reliable mechanism to cancel that transaction and resend it with a higher fee without risk of having both transactions confirmed when only one of them should be ?
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:05:25
What advantage would this have compared to simply multiplying the block rate by k and the block reward by 1/k ?
Also what do you mean by "spam blocks" ?
If you mean empty blocks why not require a minimum number of transactions per block ?
If you mean blocks with made up transactions what advantage would that give the miner relative to the loss of fees from real transactions ?
@_date: 2015-06-12 01:39:30
I don't think that's exactly what the ruling is saying though.
It seems like there are some very fine distinctions going on around the word "business".
This ruling was in response to a request for clarification from a company doing bitcoin mining.  Since it is a company I would say that it definitely qualifies as a business according to usual English usage.
The paragraph I quoted says:
"...the user is not acting as an exchanger, notwithstanding the fact that the user is accepting a real currency or another convertible virtual currency and transmitting Bitcoin, so long as the user is undertaking the transaction solely for the user’s own purposes and not as a business service performed for the benefit of another."
I think this is saying that a business is not a money transmitter if its transactions are done solely for its own benefit and not as a service it provides for some 3rd parties (ie. its customers). 
Note that there is a somewhat similar concept appearing in the NYS Bitlicense which talks about being a "customer business".  I suspect that the intent of the Bitlicense was to align somewhat with the FINCEN definitions.
I agree that these distinctions are very confusing.  I'm not certain to have understood the true intent behind the regulations and I'm not sure the government agents charged with enforcing them understand them either.  
I think part of the reason this is so confusing is that on the one hand the government would like all exchanges of value to be subject to MSB like regulation but doing that would essentially turn off the economy, which they would prefer to avoid.  After all virtually any non-perishable good could be used as a means of exchange.  
It's just one symptom of the schizophrenia created by a legal system that is supposed to allow freedom while simultaneously preventing anything bad from happening.
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:08:23
I believe that case involved someone running a bitcoin ATM which seems somewhat different from buying and selling on localbitcoins.
There are FINCEN rulings referenced from that thread which appear to exclude simply buying and selling in two party transactions from being defined as money transmission (at least at the federal level). 
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:33:57
I think I'm missing something fundamental here which is making it difficult for me to understand most of your post and I suspect this "missing link" is most related to the last part.
Suppose I have an address in my wallet that contains 5 BTC and I send a transaction to spend 1 of them.  Later I (or my wallet) resends that transaction, maybe with a higher fee.  As far as the code is concerned wouldn't the second transaction actually be a distinct transaction with the same inputs and outputs ?  How does the code know that I didn't actually intend to send 2 1 BTC transactions instead of just 1 ? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:53:20
The current total hash rate is running at about 3.5e17 H/s.
See: 
That corresponds to about 25 BTC/10 minutes = 3600 BTC/day.  So the return is about 1.e-14 (BTC/day)/(H/s).
20 TH/s = 2.e13 H/s.
Generally I think the return should be roughly proportional to hash rate so that would give you about 
0.2 BTC/day.
Watch out for scams.
@_date: 2015-06-14 01:21:04
It should be showing progress though.  There should be a message in the status bar telling you how far behind it is (ie. in years/days/hours etc.).  If you don't see a message like that something's wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-18 06:36:35
In addition to the documents mentioned by others I think this FINCEN ruling may be highly relevant to what they mean by an MSB:
This ruling specifically refers to miners but it appears to state that the means by which a person obtains bitcoin is not relevant to the ruling:
"How a user obtains a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as “earning,” “harvesting,” “mining,” “creating,” “auto-generating,” “manufacturing,” or “purchasing,” depending on the details of the specific virtual currency model involved. The label applied to a particular process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of the person engaging in the process to send that virtual currency or its equivalent value to any other person or place. What is material to the conclusion that a person is not an MSB is not the mechanism by which a person obtains the convertible virtual currency, but what the person uses the convertible virtual currency for, and for whose benefit. "
  Here I think is the important paragraph (note last sentence):
"From time to time, as your letter has indicated, it may be necessary for a user to convert Bitcoin that it has mined into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, either because the seller of the goods or services the user wishes to purchase will not accept Bitcoin, or because the user wishes to diversify currency holdings in anticipation of future needs or for the user’s own investment purposes. In undertaking such a conversion transaction, the user is not acting as an exchanger, notwithstanding the fact that the user is accepting a real currency or another convertible virtual currency and transmitting Bitcoin, so long as the user is undertaking the transaction solely for the user’s own purposes and not as a business service performed for the benefit of another. A user’s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter."
  Note also that there is a footnote on this paragraph that may or may not be important.  Please read the full ruling rather than relying on these quotes for anything important.

The conversion in (2) isn't meaningful.
It's probably based on how much general purpose computing power would be needed to equal the power of all bitcoin ASIC miners.  But the ASIC's are not general purpose computers, they can only do one thing (compute SHA256 hashes) and they are orders of magnitude more efficient at that one task than a general purpose CPU.
@_date: 2017-02-18 15:14:03
Comparing a general purpose CPU to a specific hardware implementation doesn't really make sense.
For example you can emulate some hardware CPU on some other (or the same) hardware but with orders of magnitude less efficiency.  You could also nest a chain of such emulations to arbitrary depth.  What could you conclude from comparing these efficiencies ?

OK, I guess you were talking about comments prior to the final regulation being released.

Does abandontransaction actually work ?  I tried using it in a similar situation yesterday and it did not.  As far as I can tell it will refuse to abandon any transaction that it considers to be in the mempool.  But I think the first thing the client does on startup is load wallet transactions into the local mempool.  So I don't understand under what circumstances this command is supposed to work.
What worked for me was restarting with the -zapwallettxes command line option.
@_date: 2016-06-13 05:42:36
The main inputs are the hash of the previous block and the merkle tree root hash of the transactions in the block being mined.
The amount of data being hashed is constant with the length of the chain because only the hash of the previous block in the chain is used and that's always the same size.
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:36:23


Not if the new transaction spends the same coins as the old transaction since only one of those two transactions can get mined.
It's a bit more complicated to actually do that because the core client won't allow you to respend coins used in wallet transactions even if those transactions aren't confirmed.
There's a command line option: -zapwallettxes that will clear your wallet of all transactions it will then scan the blockchain for any transactions that belong to you so your wallet will end up containing only confirmed transactions and you will be free to respend coins from unconfirmed transactions.  You could then use the coin control feature (enable from options) to create a new transaction spending the same coins as the low-fee transaction you want to resend.
I would suggest you backup your wallet before doing this because some metadata might be lost by zapwallettxes - then you will be safe in case you're not OK with what happens.
Note that new versions of the client have a command called abandontransaction that is supposed to make this easier but I don't think it works.
@_date: 2016-06-25 15:28:55
I can't really answer your first question since the most I've bought at once was about $100.  I think the largest cards they have are about $1000.  There may be something in the terms and conditions about how much you can have on your account at one time.
As for wait time they use Bitpay (I think there's an option to use Coinbase instead which might require you to have an account there, I'm not sure) and in my experience it's very fast.  At most they might require one confirmation.

It seems very confusing to me.
In particular does definition 12-a "Sale or issuance of payment instruments or stored value primarily for

apply to virtual currency or not ?
Bitcoin doesn't seem to meet the definition of "stored value" because it isn't "a claim against the issuer".
It isn't clear to me whether it matches the definition of a "payment instrument".  It seems to me that it is unlike the other examples of payment instruments because they all represent something that like the definition of "stored value" could be considered to be a "claim against the issuer" though that terminology isn't used here.
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:30:42
You would want to make sure that the second transaction spends the same inputs (ie. coins) as the first transaction.  Then you know that only one of those transactions can ever get confirmed no matter what anyone else does.  That's why you need to clear out the first transaction from your wallet first because otherwise your wallet won't allow you to send a conflicting transaction.
To do this you could for example use the coin control feature in bitcoin core (needs to be enabled in the options menu).  I think other clients have similar features.

It's really odd that there wasn't more significance to the background pattern of the blocks.  If you count the numbers of grid, horizontal, vertical and black backgrounds you get numbers that match a 6x6 triangular matrix like this:
G - - - - |
B G - - - |

I found it hard to believe that was a coincidence so I was convinced you needed to find a permutation of the blocks that gave this pattern.

@_date: 2016-06-25 16:04:00
So it looks like the only case where abandontransaction might work is if transactions have expired from the local mempool after the 72 hour limit.  However the client keeps trying to resend unconfirmed wallet transactions periodically.  Wouldn't that prevent them from expiring from the mempool ?
In any case it looks like if you don't want to wait 72 hours you have to use -zapwallettxes. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 23:31:09
If you sell on LBC and buy on exchanges the coins are still your own while you have them.  This seems equivalent to me to someone doing day trading in stocks or commodities and as far as I know day traders aren't considered money transmitters.  You aren't transmitting money for a third party like a normal MSB does.
Some of the FINCEN rulings regarding the virtual currency guidance seem to suggest that this should be OK, but I don't know about the various state laws.  On the other hand I'm not convinced the federal government has a completely coherent position on this either.
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:56:32
This is good information and should probably be put in the FAQ or made into a sticky post given the number of questions that appear here concerning this problem.
I would add that for the bitcoin core client there is a command line startup option: -zapwallettxes that is easier to use than exporting/importing keys (you should probably backup your wallet before using it though since it may lose some transaction metadata).
As far as I can tell the new abandontransaction command is unlikely to work because it will refuse to abandon a transaction that is in the local mempool and I think the first thing the client does on startup is load unconfirmed wallet transactions into the mempool.  If someone could explain under what circumstances this command would actually work I would appreciate it.

I think it may be related to acting as an agent or intermediary between two parties (ie. the employer and the employee) rather than as a party making a transaction for its own direct benefit.  Various rulings by FinCEN suggest that this is how things are seen by the federal regulator.  So far there is much less clarity at the NY state level.

On your second point.
The exemption covers:
"merchants and consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or

That explicitly says "purchase or sale of goods or services".  If you're using bitcoin to purchase goods then you're not accepting bitcoin, you're paying with it, so the direction of the transaction is irrelevant there as well.

I don't understand that interpretation.
If you invest you buy an asset with the expectation that you will be able to sell it later.  Nobody would invest in a perfectly illiquid asset.  I think investment purposes has to include both buying and selling to make any sense at all.

Where are you getting this distinction between the buyer and the seller ?
Buying and selling are both regulated by the bitlicense if done "as a customer business".
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:48:01
You don't have to register to sell your mutual fund shares either.
I don't think the question of who needs to be licensed is related to who is on the buy side and who is on the sell side of a transaction.
I think the question has to do with who is acting as a "customer business".  I haven't seen a clear definition of this term but if you look at some of the FinCEN rulings you get the impression that being an MSB has to do with acting as an agent in a transaction between other parties.  Direct transactions between two parties don't typically appear to trigger MSB regulations.
I'm not a lawyer or finance expert, I'm just trying to understand what these regulations really mean based on available information.  
I'd definitely be interested in seeing the analysis you mentioned if you can find it, though I'm sceptical when people claim to understand regulations that involve such subtle distinctions and unclear and even contradictory language.  For example I wouldn't put much stock in an analysis of the Federal MSB regulations that didn't explicitly take into account the various FinCEN rulings that have also been published on them.

"Bitlicense only affects the seller."
You're at least the second person making this claim here.
What evidence do you have that the bitlicense makes a distinction between the buyer and the seller ? I don't see it in the text of the regulation.
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:11:17
The NYS regulation says you need a bitlicense if you are (among other things):
"buying and selling Virtual Currency as a customer business".
It also contains an exemption for
"merchants and consumers that utilize Virtual Currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or
services or for investment purposes"
I don't know what exactly the line is between buying and selling as a "customer business" and buying and selling "for investment purposes" but this distinction seems to be the key to what exactly you can legally do in NY without the license.
I wonder if the NY DFS has a process for asking for clarifying rulings like FinCEN does.  There are a number of FinCEN rulings that appear to significantly limit the scope of what they consider to be an MSB relative to what a lay reader would understand from the regulations themselves.

By setting a low difficulty you could easily create a chain with more blocks than the current chain starting from the genesis block.
If the network used the block height to determine the best chain your chain would win.

Volatility cuts both ways (ie. you could gain or lose).  I'm not sure what you mean by "fees taken by middlemen involved in a bitcoin transaction".  If you mean miner fees those depend on the volume of data in the transaction, not the amount of btc transferred, so they can potentially be a very low percentage for large (in amount) transactions.
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:46:48
I think what people find a little surprising about the claim is that if remittances are developing to a significant degree one would expect to see an effect on the daily transaction volume.  But that looks pretty flat: 
Then again it looks like the **daily** transaction volume is about $100 million.  So $40 million **per year** isn't going to show up much.

But the email doesn't say anything about swaps.
It only asks about experience "trading Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies".
I didn't think CFTC had jurisdiction over that.
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:25:34
If you read carefully the FinCEN rulings it doesn't look like engaging in direct person to person transactions should require an MSB license.  
There doesn't appear to be any monetary threshold that applies to cryptocurrencies.  I think there's a $1000 threshold for foreign exchange but they don't consider that to apply to cryptocurrencies.
Some states may have broader laws though.  Somebody just got a 90 day sentence in Florida for just this: 
Whether this would be exempt under the NYS bitlicense is also less clear.
IANAL and this is just my interpretation of the texts I've seen.

I doubt very much a bank would be allowed to permanently freeze funds wired to your account.  That would amount to the bank confiscating those funds and I can't see how that could be legal.  Of course they may close your account and they may file suspicious activity reports to the government which might be able to confiscate your funds (in the US at least), but there's at least some possibility of recourse if that happens.

Just for clarification, was this a fiat or crypto withdrawal ?
@_date: 2015-09-28 06:20:22
That raises another question for me.  Is there a convenient way to segregate coins into separate sets so that a wallet won't combine coins between sets ?  I'm not aware of such a feature in bitcoin core, though I imagine you could do it with raw transactions.  I would think it would be a feature many people would want though, is it available in other wallets ?
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:38:30
Am I correct in understanding that the CFTC can now regulate trading in bitcoin derivatives but not trading in bitcoin itself ?
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:19:52
I think it's mostly a chicken and egg problem.  I don't think it's currently very difficult for merchants to accept bitcoin, there are several services that make that easy.  The problem is that there are so few people who want to spend it that few merchants are making this step because any gains from accepting bitcoin will be very small.
My feeling is that little by little usage will increase and that will in turn lead to more adoption which will further increase usage.  That's a recipe for exponential growth
but right now the rate of that growth is much smaller than many people were hoping.
There are also some significant obstacles to overcome.  
Bitcoin has a major fundamental advantage over credit cards and similar methods of payment in that it doesn't require the buyer to provide information that can be used to steal from him.  Unfortunately the costs of credit card fraud are currently absorbed by the system in ways that hide them from consumers (I think they're more visible to merchants).
The legal uncertainty created by a number of government actions, like prosecuting people for buying and selling bitcoins when the regulator rulings don't even make this clearly illegal, is also certainly not helping.

I would completely remove all bitcoin data files (except of course for wallet.dat if it contains coins and possibly bitcoin.conf) and retry.

My guess is that it was just an inaccurate statement.  What was probably meant was something like "funds from the sale of bitcoin cannot be used in qualifying for a real estate loan (at least for this lender)".
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:01:39
Yeah but I don't think even nonce + extraNonce gives you enough bits (it may have in the early days when the difficulty was much lower) so you still need to fiddle with other data or with the transactions.
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:15:35
Right, in bitcoin core it's defined as a 32 bit type but since it's inserted into the script sig of the coinbase transaction other data types can be used.
@_date: 2015-10-04 09:44:15
I'm puzzled by why this is causing problems though.
Most sites that accept btc, including this one, let you create an address for receiving payments to your account.  Any confirmed btc sent to that address should show up in your account, regardless of transaction id.
The site can't know the transaction id until it actually sees the transaction.  For txid malleability to cause a problem the site would have to remember the first txid it sees and then ignore other transactions to that address.  Why would a wallet do that ?
@_date: 2016-05-08 19:32:54
You are correct that the nonce bits are not enough to ensure a valid hash.
I'm not sure exactly how miners do it but there are many other places that data can be changed to change the hash, including the extraNonce field and data that can added to the coinbase transaction.  They may just select different transactions though.
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:08:41
Probably. There are wallet recovery services but I think they need you to have a significant amount of information about the password.
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:40:20
Bitcoin core passwords are arbitrary strings passed to the command:
encryptwallet passphrase
either in the debug console or bitcoin-cli.
There may also be a GUI option in Settings but I can't check that because I don't have access to that menu right now (some GUI bug that happens on Ubuntu).

Sure the problem is that anyone using an unapproved blockchain would be breaking the law and would be subject to prosecution.  The vast majority of Americans today would not want to take that risk.
Note that I'm discussing a purely hypothetical scenario here that was not brought up by me.  I see no reason to think that we're heading in this direction in the near future.  But it's certainly a possible scenario especially if bitcoin ever becomes big enough to pose a real challenge to traditional financial institutions and government tax revenue.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:33:51
In bitcoin core open the debug console and use the dumpwallet command to dump your wallet in WIF format.
You should then be able to import the WIF private keys into Electrum.

The global available bandwidth of the bitcoin blockchain is currently only about 10 MB per hour.  If such a service were widely used it would become very expensive and drive transaction fees sky high.

That's a strange path to have for your data directory.  The default would usually be something like:

How did you install bitcoin core ?
Also if you copy-pasted the path in your comment it looks like it may contain an extra space after Program Files that I don't think should be there (but then I doubt that path is correct at all).

You appear to be misinformed.  As far as I know Amazon and Target don't accept bitcoin, but there are sites where you can buy their gift cards for bitcoin.
From what I've seen the majority of major sites that accept bitcoin accept it through Bitpay, with a minority using coinbase.

Your question didn't ask about enforcement.

The transaction is sent from your node to all its peers.

Then I'm puzzled why this doesn't yet exist.  The only sidechain proposal I've heard about is Lightning and that seems much more complex.  I also don't see why segwit would be needed to enable this.
I can see that to make it bidirectional some sort of support from bitcoin may be required but even if you could only send to the new chain it seems like it could still have considerable utility and it seems like anyone could implement such a coin with or without buy in from the bitcoin side.

That's the installation directory, not the data directory.
Assuming there's no bitcoin data (ie. wallets, downloaded blockchain, etc) on this machine you need to save or that you have that backed up I would Uninstall Bitcoin Core then remove the following directories (or make sure they're gone):
C:\Program Files\Bitcoin
C:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin
Then run the installer.  When the client starts up (ie. after the installer finishes) you should now get a window asking if you want to set the data directory.  Leave the default selected and click OK.
That should give you the usual data directory.  Whether that will fully solve your problem remains to be seen.

Yes, each node maintains a list of known peers and chooses to connect to a subset of them.  Peer information is exchanged between nodes.
Blocks are distinct from transactions. Duplicate transactions are ignored (each transaction has a unique id) so a node knows if it has seen a transaction before and won't add duplicates to the mempool.
Blocks are also uniquely identified by hash and so also cannot be duplicated.

Sure there's very little the government can't do.  In the 1930's the US government outlawed the private ownership of gold.  Today any business receiving more than $10k in cash in a single transaction has to file a report with the government.  Also it seems that the police routinely seize cash from people they stop for minor infractions without evidence of wrongdoing.
I don't see anything that would prevent congress from passing a law implementing the scenario you describe if they had the political will to do so.
EDIT: On the other hand I doubt they could force the core developers to make code changes needed to implement this type of scenario (ie. tying identity to bitcoin addresses) so if such a law were passed it might have the effect of outlawing the practical use of bitcoin by legitimate businesses.
