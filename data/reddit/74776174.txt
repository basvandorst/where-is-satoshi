To be fair, bitcoin users are rushing lightning out the door right now before it's ready, so it's sorta the same, but on a much smaller scale than multimillion dollar ICO contracts that can't be undone.

 berserker mode:
 Encrypted multisig wallet parts on M-Discs in a Faraday cage (A dangerous solar storm is inevitable, the 1859 CME event knocked out telegraph wires for weeks, we narrowly avoided a similar one in 2012, it would be devastating happening today), then wrap all that in a UL Class 125 3-hour rated fireproof box. On top you'll be needing geographical and geopolitical redundancy in secure private facilities, not all with the same company, actual storage costs won't be that much averaged over time, effort required is magnitudes more. 
 mode: 
Learn about data degradation and archival best practices, make backups, use multisig, trust some people (they don't need to understand bitcoin to hold your keys), engage with lawyers/accountants and other criminals. A usb in a safe deposit box isn't a long term solution due to bit rot, a paper wallet in that same box isn't failsafe either.

Virtually all large scale mining is performed close to cheap renewable power sources. Places like Sichaun province have huge hydroelectric oversupply at times, power companies happily sell for virtually nothing, mining has coalesced around places like this. Same goes for other areas like the pacific northwest, it's very common.
On airtravel also:


@_date: 2017-08-10 22:39:59
And when people say it doesn't matter because they are valid fees it ignores the fact that if miners perform the attack they recoup most of the fees. 
Sometimes turns out to be a net gain for the miner, tx fees bump up in response.
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:09:39
How does a scarily low hashrate run by a few miners benefit consumers? It's a security risk for any real sums of money.
If you all you wanted was low fees there's a thousand other blockchains that are far more secure, have faster transactions and already exist with flourishing communities.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:08:55
Energy usage is a pointless measure, isn't carbon emissions the real problem?  
And no one seems able to quantify that too easily with miners, people just pull out meaningless blurbs like "Bitcoin uses as much energy as Austria"
If miners are using 100% renewables then what does it matter how much power they use? 
Sichuan and Pacific NW miners are all running off hydroelectric. The biggest ethereum mine is in Iceland and 100% renewable. With renewable resources its often use it or lose it, unlike a pile of coal you can burn anytime.
People really need to stop conflating energy usage with harm.

A company that receives bitcoins for their tokens doesn't have $100m in the bank? If someone bought $10m worth of tethers 2 years ago and held them, Tether Co would have $100m in 2017.
Do people forget there are two parties in a BTC/USDT transaction? 
So much unsubstantiated fud here. They had an audit, their bank accounts were checked. Arguing after that is pointless,has any other exchange done a public audit?

They pretend as though all power is created equal, when all the biggest miners in the world are near hydro in China, US, Scandinavia/Iceland. Together they make a good chunk of total hashpower.

Australia is well reasonable with cryptocurrencies, ATO has it clearly defined, individuals can spend it on purchases under $10k with no capital gains or reporting. It's essentially considered barter until you hit that limit.
Even tiny businesses in Australia have to deal with  anti-moneylaundering/terror-financing laws, was no surprise they jumped on bitcoin too. Meanwhile the largest bank in country gets caught breaking those same laws over 50,000 times and no one even lost their job over it. Pay some fines, be on your way.
