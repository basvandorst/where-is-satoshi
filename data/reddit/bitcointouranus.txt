Easy to do. This shit wasn't worth worrying about a few years back. So what you lost $50? No big deal... Fast forward to today's price and now it's an issue. I lost about $2.5M due to a very similar mistake. It happens. Nothing you can do, so just move on.

Every time I've purchased btc, it's been what I thought was a dip. I've long ago come to realize it doesn't matter when you buy it, so long as you have it when the rug gets yanked out from under you. Beans, bullets, and BTC. I'm future planning.

Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not in any capacity supporting Ver. I'm merely saying cock-blocking all felons because they're felons isn't necessarily the smartest idea. It also really depends on the felony. Raped a cat? I'm not hiring you. Sold a 20 year old college student 2 tall boys and a black&amp;mild cigar without ID because they were a flirt? I'll at least read the resume. Some folks learn from their mistakes.  (no, I'm not a felon.)

Might have been referring to pearling. In prison they use the melted stick from a ballpoint pen can to make the pearls. Using a hollow tube (pen body) you shove it through the skin of the peener, exiting the other side. Stick the ball on the end of the tube. Stick another tube on the ball so you can hold the ball between the two tubes. Move the tube back into the skin, stopping when the ball is where you want it. Withdraw both tubes. Stitch both incisions, try not to bone up.

2X is forking from Bitcoin. If 2X wins, it hopes to become Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin developers didn't say 1MB forever, they did voice possible support for larger blocks should the absolute need arise and a proper software solution be presented for peer review and analysis. Additionally, you may or may not know that the "2MB increase" is actually allowing up to 8MB blocks, not a 2MB total block size. 
Edit: if/once the fork happens, your BTC will be spendable on both chains. If you send your BTC to a B2X wallet, B2X is what you end up with. If you send your BTC to a BTC wallet, you end up with BTC. You can split the BTC into both halves and possess equal amounts the first time you transact after the fork. There are specific instructions floating around for how to do it, although I'd recommend that you wait for advancements. Don't wing it or you will lose.

I'd like to see an official response to this.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:48:57
I'm not even remotely concerned about these short term dips. I think about it this way: 
If this project succeeds for the duration of its scope everybody wins. If Bitcoin fails, it's because we've all nuked each other and there's nothing left but roaches and twinkies. 
I buy some every week after pay day, high or low.
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:38:06
Who did?
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:59:06
Correct me if I'm wrong, but couldn't you stick them on a phone wallet during the fork period?
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:18:08
If you are willing to pony up for the experience I say go for it!  Might be fun. You never know, that thing might be valuable later in life.

@_date: 2017-09-18 22:59:18
I look at it this way: If bitcoin undermines banking in any noticeable way, it's worth it at twice the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:57:43


Thanks pal, much obliged.

Future money vs fiat money. If you believe that the dollar will always be king then up 10% is fine. If you don't, buy the dip. It's decimal placement that matters.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:50:37
Right answer 
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:44:00
If we don't want the feature you want and you propose a dangerous way to implement said feature anyways, what incentive is there for us to cooperate in any way? Why should we tell you a better way of achieving the thing we don't want?
 
B2X is a step towards centralization when we should be stepping back. No support.

Openbazaar was clear that while they favor the shitcoin, you can switch to the BTC daemon and receive regular BTC. If you don't like, don't support it

That's a fair question that I don't have the answer to. I use my desktop wallet to do all my sending and I have never taken the time to see. Next time I send i'll time it and see if its reasonable.

People regularly sell illegal items on the clearweb. EBay and Craigslist is full of knockoff goods and jailbroken firesticks. Do you take issue using those avenues? This isn't much different.

"For the record, mining has absolutely nothing to do with making the currency secure. No, the purpose of mining is perverse: to solve a problem whose only purpose is that it is increasingly difficult to solve"

Not an apt comparison though, bch was a smooth fork with proper replay protection. B2X doesn't have that. It's designed to be destructive to BTC.

This helps in the fight against 2x, but isn't AS secure for your personal transactions as it would be running a node from where you transact. I'm all for this and will do this, but know that this isn't enough for real decentralization. You don't own the hardware this is running on.

People do want it upgraded, just not by a closed door executive meeting where none were invited to the party. It would be like me showing up at your house and telling you that on November 16th you're switching from 1% milk to 2% milk because it's better in some way whether you like it or not, because I agreed with your neighbor that the 3 of us are doing it.

@_date: 2017-10-24 03:19:49
For this event? No real reason not to. In general? Your keys your coins. If you don't have the keys you don't really have the coins. If you do intend to hold coins longterm on Coinbase be sure to use the vault feature for safety.

I had that just the other day. I rebooted my phone and relaunched the app and after my vpn fully connected it worked fine. It's just an app hiccup. If your keys are secure then your coins should be just fine.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:26:07
You get the new things regardless if you both own BTC and control the keys. Where are your coins? Hardware wallet? Paper? Electrum? You control those keys. Hosted exchange? Odds are you don't hold the private key to that. Answer the where and you'll answer your own question.
