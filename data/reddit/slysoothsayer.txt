Yea, I was going to use bittrex and I looked into gdax. Does my info from Coinbase carry over to gdax or do I have to get reverified

It's up to you 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:40:49
Yea I hope so, I was trying to buy a dip under 5k but I realized we many never see 4K again and in 10 years a couple hundred won't make a difference. I just spent 1/4th of what I have now and save the rest for a dip. My goal is to own 5 btc before 20
