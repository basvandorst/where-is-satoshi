Do not be stupid
keep Calm
Do not let your emotions take over your mind
keep your head cold guy
Learn to discuss rationally
We are talking about not only about glass currencies over btc
And you better get used to my comments here
Otherwise cross the street without looking sideways -
  (ahhahahahahh)
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:50:37
Now 6.790 $ USD per 1 TBC
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:43:32
I had spent $ 200 to pay a small bank debt
Now everything has been recovered
small profit
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:51:01
I do not care
You understood what I meant, and that's what matters
Are you politically correct?
I'm not, I hate politically correct people,
are idiots and hypocrites
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:18:27
let's go......6.850$.....so 7k$
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:02:22
Yesterday I wrote here that we were going to 7k in the next days, but everything was very fast, 1btc now costs 7.143 USD, it was very fast XD
Now we are going very fast for 8k,
OMG, I'M GETTING FEAR
Well, if until the end of the year the expectation and reach 10k ha, I think in this speed at the end of November we will already be at 10k $
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:53:20
No matter what you say man, buy btc as soon as possible
You'll be rich in the next months / years, believe me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:04:46
I understand your side
Do not worry
Time is the Lord of Reason
This is already happening
The worst blind and the one who does not want to see.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:28:59
OMG 6.910$ usd?,....next 7k$, My eyes......Lol
I already knew, in the next hours, days will reach 7k $ / 8k, and depis 10k $ USD
Can believe!
In the next few days bitcoins will be wild :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:58:04
Yeah, I'll wait for the next dive, too.
plus the price of btc will be so high that it will not make much difference, believe me
No one can stop this black hole called bitcoin (
the market will grow more and more, the number of people using btc will increase considerably day after day
the number of millionaires as well
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:00:20
This is a classic error of all beginners
Here's my advice
40% BTC
40% on BTCASH
20% on ETH, LTC, RIPLE and you will succeed
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:01
What is Yuji ?, a new virtual currency?,
send me a pm explaining what Yuji and details of your terms, 
send me your email too, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:54:39
My future financial plan
I'm investing in the top 50 virtual currencies
even if I have to invest only 1 $ and buy only 1 virtual currency I'm doing it
I have
and I intend to invest $ 1k / $ 1.5k in another 40 or 46 virtual currencies by the end of the year
I hope to multiply by 3 my investment in 1 or 2 years, this would already be a good profit, no bank in the world will offer me this formidable profit
Of course for this I must risk my 1.5k c.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:22:45
Plus there is a BTC exploit that can be used this way
You send btc to someone.
Next you will see 1 or 2 confirmations
Most malware sends btc to another btc key, although you may see 1 or 3 acknowledgments that btc were sent correctly
actually was sent to another btc key
So after a while you will see that there is no confirmation for the key that you sent, plus the btc were sent to another key replaced by the hacker
Make sure that you actually have confirmation that you sent to your key and only then someone sent to another key btc
I already saw this happen before
A friend was negotiating with a guy via cha
The guy asked my friend to send his btc key
He said he had sent the btc
my friend looked and saw 2 or 3 confirmations in his btc wallet
so he sent the product to this guy
in fact it was an exploit that siluma confirmations and sending of btc
Then my friend noticed that it was stolen and no btc arrived in his wallet
but the guy had already received the product, and he can not do anything
Be careful
Never send large sums of btc
Take a test before

It does not matter, if I lose money on some coins, it will certainly be compensated by other currencies, like ethereum, btccash, or monero
and that the return on my investment will be guaranteed for at least 50% of the currencies I have
I'm betting high, and profit will be high, of course I can have disappointments, but I do not care
man did not get to where he had not risked his life crossing the Atlantic Ocean towards the new world
going to the moon, and eventually to Mars
When you risk you may be disappointed and risk life, but you know you can get good rewards in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:43:23
This sounds good to me.
Every time we have a fall, it means that we will have a high,
Maybe btc will fall a little more, but will rise to 8k in the next weeks
I figure if anyone bought btc when we were between 7k and 7.5k they should be sorry now,
mainly novice people on the market and noobs about btc, did not commit suicide hahhahahhahahah
Time to buy btc and now
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:09:30
yes, 40% btc,40% btch and 20% others coins
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:43:09
Many people were also against injection
Against the TV
Against the internet
Against technology
Against BTC (you remember? 2010 and 2011?)
And you know what you gave
Do not be fooled
BTC and BTCH will continue their path in the cryptocurrense market
This is not a war, stop talking nonsense
This is a competition, and different.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:38:33
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:43:18
Yes, we will have stops and falls like yesterday and before yesterday, we can fall again to 5k $
More price will come back, this year end the price will continue to sweat up to 8k,9k and 10k and above
let's see how everything behaves before, during, and days after day 16 (segwk2)
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:02:37
my dream ))
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:55:36
Wonderful guy, me too.
this afternoon I spent $ 200
I recovered everything again because the price went up
I'm very pleased with that.
I want to see btc get to $ 10k in the next weeks
All people who invest in btc in the next months will be millionaires
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:20:04
My investiments in coins,BTC &gt;40%/BTCash&gt;40%,others coins (ETH,Riple,Monero,DASH,Litcoin.....etc)&gt;20%
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:28:13
A little philosophy
"People believe in what they want to believe", the rest and the time that you will say.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:12:47
I have more than 1k $ in btc in my HD,old account blockchain
plus I lost access to my files because my nephew formatted the HD on top of my files
I'm going to try to recover the funds and other files, I'm counting on this btc at the end of the year
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:57:29
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:08:40
nebneet,you're right, more naos and forget, sometime in the next weeks if btc reaches 10k $, we can see a dip of 1k/2k USD
If you have money to invest let me know,
I speak seriously,
send me your email at pm, I'll show you my business.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:35:05
NEBNEET,well, send a private message, let me know if you need help
Expecting btc to reach 10k $, then we will see a small dive, but the market will be strong.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:09:22
No emotion please
Dont be angry
There is no war
What exists is a competition
I will not shut my mouth
I'll keep talking,  writing, having fun and making money
You should not be angry at anything
Should take advantage of the opportunity that both BTC and BTCH is offering you and I make a cash profit
and who knows in the future to become millionaires
Good luck to you
Good luck to all, lots of money, woman and success to the good and rational investors in BTC and BTCH like me :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:54:37
my dear watson
Do not try to resist the grunts, get out of the box, leave the matrix
If it had been clear from the woman of Columbus he would never have arrived in the Americas
You must risk it, and this
You see, I hate people who have created a war between BTC and BTCH
There are no wars there is competition
Some troolls talk, I use btc, I do not use btcash
Others talk, I use BTCH I do not use BTC
Well, I am an investor, and I invest in both BTC and BTCH among other currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:05:56
Buy for 6.9k?,craze man 
I see a lot of newbies buying btc and swapping btcash for btc
This is a big mistake
with this price of 7k $ you should make a profit and not buy more btc
You should wait, soon we will have a small or big dive for 6k or 5,500 $
So it's time to buy
Life goes on
Actually, I love these newbies, they're making my profit.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:34:18

You wake up and the btc market is over 50 trillion dollars
1 btc costs around 20 million dollars
Much of the new class of billionaires in the world are former users of bitcoins
bitcoin and fashion all over the world
dozens of countries in the world have the bitcoin currency as official currency
China, the largest economic and military power on the planet, has the largest number of users of bitcoins
