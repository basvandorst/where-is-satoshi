Yeah, I guess you could verify your identity which would raise your limit. Other than that if you still plan on using Coinbase, you have to wait until your weekly limit resets :)

Meaning that you never got the payout? It's terrible how many scams there are out there nowadays, know many people who got screwed over as well...

Instead of simply buying BTC, you might want to consider this opportunity, especially if you are looking to play the medium to long term game :)
I recently joined a Bitcoin mining coop operated by a Forex trading bot, which gives returns of 1% per day over 140 days. This means that you get 140% of the amount you put in, but this amount also increases with the value of bitcoin increasing! 
Message me if you are interested, can post results if needed!

Damn, I'm sorry to hear that. It's a sad world out there when more of these sites are scams rather than legit investment opportunities...

I was a student but recently graduated. 
I didn't buy any equipment. I joined an existing infrastructure which provides this investment opportunity. 
I joined it 2 months ago and came to the conclusion that It is the best and safest method while keeping the most promising results:) let me know if you have any question

It definitely is a good time to invest now. Experts predict that BTC will keep rising to eventually reach 3-4k at the end of the year.

I must say that sounds fishy indeed...
I don't see why the packages could be out of stock. I am part of another bitcoin  mining co-op where I get about 1% return every day. Never had a problem with it to be honest.

You could be increasing it at 1% per day... I recently joined a bitcoin mining co-op where I get about 1% return every day. The compounding effect it has when you reinvest is absolutely crazy!

I think the best solution would be to put that money in BTC in a mining co-op, which would be a guaranteed win in terms of profit.

You might want to consider the opportunity below :) I am part of a bitcoin mining co-op where I get about 1% return every day. This, on top of BTC rising in value is crazy good!

I only put 250 euros at the beginning. That was 2 months ago, I already got back 150 euros from that, which I reinvested back into the coop. This means I know have 400 euros mining, which is bringing me 1% per day. I think I'll load up 1000 euros more to have bigger exponential results :)

You don't necessarily have to pay the cost of mining BTC yourself.

You might want to consider going through a bitcoin mining coop, so that you wouldn't do the mining yourself but would get daily returns.
I recently joined such a mining coop, operated by a Forex Trading bot, where I get approximately 1% daily returns. Can't stress enough how great this is compared to having your money sit in a bank which gets you negligible interests :D
