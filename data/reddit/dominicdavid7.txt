thanks for your answer.

yes, I agree. I think the point I wanted to make is that in tendency people would spend less besides their basic spending if BTC increases in value and that would in theory not be beneficial for the economy
@_date: 2019-03-27 22:44:31
thats actually the point I wanted to make. this is not the behaviour an economy is looking for. we need people to spend money now and now hold it back for future purchases since they expect to get it cheaper then.

thats true, i was just wondering what it would be at a certain point in the future if we can get rid of fiat and how the economy would work then since there are significant differences in the fiscal policy between btc and fiat.

not your keys, not your bitcoin. Atleast use electrum to store your coins and backup your seed safely

do you still have a normal job with a portfolio worth over 520 BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:52:55
you seem to be proficient at buying/selling market highs and lows! since you got it right with buying this time, let me know when you sell again, at, lets say, 250k? joke aside, good job.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:46:44
so you would consider eth a shitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:29:57
10% down and you consider selling?
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:44:06
when you talk about shitcoins, where does that start for you? after top 10? top 100?
