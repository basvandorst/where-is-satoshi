Eventually there will only be 21 million coins, each divisible 100 million times. For now there is a fraction of the total, maybe around 15 million?? ( has a wealth of information)

I don't think a wealth transfer, but wealth can be created. For example if you transfer 100,000 bits to someone in Africa, they may receive around $30 now, but if bitcoin hits $100,000/BTC then that is $10,000 USD equivalent for someone in Africa. That amount of wealth can change a couple families lives over seas.

This is the equivalent of casacius coins, what you really mean is a spreadsheet where they can just add zero to any balance? (no proof of work required)

I have used BM as well, and had a good experience, though the interface can be a bit slower. I will stay optimistic, maybe the sys admins are on vacation or something....

Bought breakfast from here with BTC
Aside from the cashier having to use a secondary device to generate an address to receive/validate payment I thought the process was easy, fast, and I didn't worry about my card being declined because of fraudulent activity. When POS systems are integrated with BTC we will see an order of magnitude improvement in experience.

My favorite is that it works independent of any printing presses, large concrete buildings, centralized ledger systems susceptible to hacking/damage/etc. or meetings with beauracrats.
