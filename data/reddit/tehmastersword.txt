He's probably right.

Just so you know, you aren't convincing anyone. Just making it really easy for everyone to tag you and ignore/laugh at you in the future

So is your lost market cap figures. The magnitude of that number's change is irrelevant, % change is the only thing that matters to the short-medium term speculator (which I think most of us are at this point)

Well for starters, the JFK-was-assassinated-by-the-banksters is nothing more than an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory.

You've misread the chart

You're wrong. Roger has admitted that he is going to push Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:07:40
This. The most likely threat from telling people you own Bitcoin is newfound envy and resentment for you.

imo the biggest value is being able to see relative changes over large scales accurately represented. If it were a linear scale, everything before mid 2013 would be impossible to make out.

To anyone seeing this video for the first time, allow me to caution you from swallowing everything it reports just on face value. It definitely shines a flashlight in the right direction, but it's riddled with half truths if memory serves.

Looks like someone made two incorrect assumptions about me in one sentence
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:32:53
Ok, I'm certainly shocked at this, and I definitely believe your source and what it's claiming. Just for the future though, your original comment saying that reporting ethnicities is illegal..... It's quite a bit different from police departments setting policies for themselves.
You painted images in my head of news reporters being dragged out of the studio and locked up for reporting information. That isn't happening

Agreed with the .1BTC threshold 
Am peasant American broke college student, nerd interested in bitcoin, only own 0.122BTC and looking to increase that up to 1 over the course of the next few months. 
I would be left out if this statistic even though I would have around 3k invested for the good part of a year. I'm definitely not unique. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:38:08
You completely missed the purpose of my response. He used a lottery metaphor to describe the rarity of this low fee transfer, treating it like it was complete chance that it happened.
I disagreed with that, it wasn't luck, just using a good wallet that allows custom fees and smart timing that can be replicated as reliably as avoiding rush hour traffic.
You're digging way too far into the details of his metaphor. Like 2 layers too deep.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:46:10
By then, computing power could very well be to the point where even poor hobbyist around the world can maintain and dedicate computers to the cause, right?

It's irrelevant. He maintains his position by transferring fiat into Bitcoin, so his profits are the same as if he paid with fiat.

\&gt;Right wing news and social media has spent years attacking Assange you plank  
Who where and when? Genuine question, all I know regarding this is that Sean Hannity fucking loves him, and I assumed that held generally true across the board because I personally haven't seen these attacks. Probably because I don't watch right wing media anymore.

Not the only, just the most probable.

Just your exchange not moving much
Your plateau looks more volatile on GDAX, for instance.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:19:51
It *could* be, but then you are trying to time the market, and that almost never works. The price could leap back up 5 seconds after you sell, and might not dip down again for you to cheaply get back on the train again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:48:29
Not the only, just the most probable.

Whoops! That's what I meant, thank you!
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:10:37
I think the fair price would be to pay biweekly in Bitcoin, whatever the going rate in conversion to USD is at the time the check is cut.
At least as long as the economy still runs on fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:38:11
What an absolute shit article. 
"Bitcoin is probably gonna fail because it's growing really fast, and look at these other things that crashed after growing really fast!"

My understanding of this chart is that an inordinate amount of people have set up sell orders right around the next milestone, lining up to cash out should the price go up.

GDAX is Coinbases own exchange. Create a coinbase account, then a linked GDAX account.
The How of all that will mostly be self explanatory in coinbase.

@_date: 2017-09-08 15:27:38
He's implying that he suspects you are a shill who is purposefully sowing fear and doubt about bitcoin, because you are a brand new account and made a beeline for this subreddit.
The reasonable explanations are....
1: You are a long time bitcoin naysayer, and only just made a reddit account to voice your opinion (okay, hello stranger)
2: You are a brand new redditor who is also new to crypto (okay, but nobody should give half a fuck what you think)
or 3: You have an agenda and just made a fresh account to spread it (He is probably is saying this)

The people who view it as an investment are only concerned with returns, so they firstly care about price. Treating it as a currency is an afterthought for the future when Bitcoin takes over.
I think we can effectively do both

@_date: 2017-10-15 15:15:36
Because escaping poverty is exceedingly difficult when the most accessible form of saving (savings accounts) are generally wiped out by inflation. 2% doesn't sound like a lot, but if Anton Antonopoulos's math is correct, that equals losing HALF your buying power over 10 years.
Inflationary systems only benefit the financial barons at the top. Deflationary systems benefit everyone.
