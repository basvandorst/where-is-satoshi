I've had localbitcoins charge me percentages that high for a transaction and then looking at the actual transaction on the block chain they charged less for every transaction sent out at the same time all added together.  Like they charged me .01 for a transaction and then on chain going to 100 different wallets the miner fee was less than .005.  Opened a ticket and they just said, "stop bitching" for every response pretty much.

Is Monero worrying you know or something?
@_date: 2016-08-22 21:24:43
It's in the same article at the bottom.

It's about as much of a scam as the real tokens will be.

Why does Coinbase suck so badly at actually responding to people when they need help?  It always seems to be resolved once a user posts a thread here.  OP waited a long time for someone to help legitimately before they did what every Coinbase user has to do for real help.

This was going to be my question.   When people deposit direct from their bank to coinbase how does tether get involved?
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:08:33
They charge so much in fees and the exchange rate is pretty shitty.  On top of that they charge way too much for the miner fee on the coin they send out (and they don’t use it for the miner fee really.  They just pocket it).
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:11:09
It is still over 120,000...

You are too in love with Bitcoin to think about it rationally.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:06:55
After talking with many people unfamiliar with how bitcoin works I think they do feel like 1 Bitcoin is like 1 stock.   
I when you explain how coinbase works they think of it as the stock market kind of.  I had to explain to three different people that you can buy $5 worth if you want.

I was introduced to  by a seller on localbitcoins.com when I started a trade and realized 270,000+ pending transactions were waiting with over $13,000,000 in fees going with it.  
I asked if he had any alt coins to sell instead and he mentioned his account on localethereum.  I have looked at litecoinlocal.com but it has crap for offers and thought it got hack a tear or two back
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:11:26
That’s how Abra does it (doesn’t actually give you the alt coin you buy) and it is some sketchy stuff.

Thanks for the info.  All of these new posts popping up today were making me confused as to what exactly is going on.  It annoys me that there are like four things  with Bitcoin in the name.  
@_date: 2016-01-11 22:16:22
So he was banned from Reddit because of something he did to another company?  What about AMAs that deal with murderers or other illegal activity?  Is Reddit banning anyone with a comment that admits to engaging in criminal activity because their is a large number of people that openly talk about crimes they have committed on here.
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:14:46
Good thing bitcoins are never stolen.

If it splits does that mean everyone that owns bitcoins will also own an equal number of BTU (like what happened with that other coin not that long ago)?
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:17:43
No.  Which is why headlines like these suck a bundle of dicks.  Maybe if people don't want the price to drop even further they should chose their words when making a post headline.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:49:51
Amen.  Also if people would start calling themselves holders instead that would be cool too.

Bitcoin has become confusing to me again.  Why the hell are there 70,000 unconfirmed transactions now?  I thought we were past that.  This subreddit  talks about like five different types of Bitcoin now.   
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:16:16
I love Bitcoins and I don't understand the feud between /Bitcoin and /BTC, I only subscribe to this one.  I have noticed how anything remotely complaining that gets posted here will receive a ton of comments calling it trolls or shills.  Can people not like something and still bitch about it because it has elements that frustrate them?
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:09:17
This kind of relates and I don't want to make a new post just to ask but can someone verify that this has more than enough fee  (0.0004 BTC)  for the size (879 bytes)
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:34:09
Don’t let them steal your $10,000, err $8,000 no $6,000 bitcoins!

@_date: 2017-04-17 06:16:16
What if they needed during the week?  Four days ago there were 80,000 unconfirmed transactions.   Will the fee always bee .10 cents if I use this to send to other people?
@_date: 2016-02-18 06:34:03
Exactly.  This is fairly trivial.

21000+ unconfirmed transactions as of 1:09PM central time.  So awesome.
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:23:23
I think the recent extension of the length of time before a underfunded transaction is returned to the wallet was a mistake.
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:22:53
I am asking this because I don't know the answer 100% and think it might help some  other users as well.
Story time:
A few days ago I withdrew about .05btc from a gambling site in a few different transactions.   All but the last one game through within an hour.  The one not getting confirmations was this one:
It has a low fee of 114~sat/B but here we are 5 days later and it still hasn't confirmed and there are "only" 60,000 transactions now (100,000+ less transactions from when it was first broadcast).   
I tried viabtc.com so many times and it would say it would be included but it never was.    I started going  backwards looking for more uncompleted transactions and keep finding them until I get bored of looking (at around 10 back or so) here:
So my question is:
 **Does every prior transaction that is part of what ends up as your transaction have to be confirmed before your transaction will be?**
I'm pretty sure the answer is yes and that's why viabtc doesn't help me it all because the transactions before mine have to confirm first.   I can't even use viabtc on any of those transactions because the fee included is lower than what viabtc will allow.  Any suggestions on how to speed this  up?   I can't adjust my miner fee because it's done via the exchange I use.  I have been using my own wallet for the longest time (where I own the private key) but I wanted to use something that would allow me to store multiple types of cryptocurrency and be able to send and receive at home and out and about.
Thanks for  your help.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:15:29
This is how:
Yes, I had to track down all of the unconfirmed transactions ominous transactions prior to mine and then try to accelerate them through viabtc for 48 hours straight or so because it's difficult to be able to get a spot in the viabtc blocks because so many people are doing the same thing I think.   Normally I would try to submit a TX right after they found a block but the final time (when I had three more txs to submit) I just tried at random and they were accepted.  Two minutes later the next block was found by viabtc.
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:12:31
21000+ unconfirmed right now.
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:14:42
Yeah, this is pretty lame.  The number of unconfirmed transactions just keeps going up.

For fun I put the txid in at pushtx.btc.com to see the fee to push it through. $36 hahahah.
Although that site is very helpful for showing exactly what the problem is on the transaction.

Up to 36000 and some change.  I now know that I'll have to get different wallet software because the "30 minute" medium priority setting is just flat out bullshit.  
I made the transaction because I wanted to take care of something hours ago.

Back when there were only around 15,000 unconfirmed transactions at any given time I had them charge me between .002 and .006 to send money off their site about five times one day and they wouldn't do anything to rectify the issue.  Multiple support tickets with excuses was all I got.
