But it's important to state, "supply and demand", to legitimize how we have all abandoned the lack of mainstream utility appeal, and instead embraced the current phase: convincing-mainstream-adoption-through-infomercial-snakeoil-marketing.
Turn off adblock for a few days and see what's happening out there.
This is not going to end well. The euphoria and celebrating is almost entirely centered on speculation and price, launching new speculation vehicles (exchanges), and outrageous ICO/alt valuations. All while... since everyone has become a religious fanatic for Bitcoin due to gains driven by when they bought in, not by fundamentals or feature growth, there is a 0% chance of rhetoric ever being negative. Rhetoric will adapt and always spin positive. I remember just 3-4 years ago, Bitcoin was so much more than a store of value. And now that is exclusively what the high priests chant.
I never thought we'd be in year 9, and the actual utility (most simplistically, let's use micro-payments as an example), would still not be there.
When Coinbase released the tipping "like buttons" years ago, I was so excited. They rather quickly abandoned them due to lack of adoption.

My sarcastic point is remind everyone the ridiculous price increase is dependent on the banksters and the status quo legitimizing Bitcoin. Feel free to go completely underground and detached from heavily regulated exchanges. That's supposed to be the actual goal, but instead, price euphoria is so fun we abandon the actual ideals.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:08:19
So basically...
Bitcoin should go from decentralized P2P payment experiment, to 'store of value', to manic speculation vehicle for armchair wannabe traders, did I say it's a store of value yet?, then skip immediately to overthrow existing systems of government and taxation while simultaneously making fiat irrelevant.
Got it, thank you.

It's difficult to compare this to the early Internet, given the cost of personal computers in the 1980s and early/mid 1990s. But, if we put a range and say the skeptical and hesitant mainstream adoption of the Internet began in the early 1990s, can we agree it took 6-10 years for proper mainstream acceptance?
Many of the verbage above has to be defined, as someone can easily say "acceptance" is ongoing still. But I think it's fair to say that mainstream Internet adoption took 6-10 years overlapping with the challenge of making personal computing mainstream.
From my perspective, the greatest challenge with Bitcoin is too many competing voices on what the purpose is. Store of value and a backbone/entry point into crypto is the primary purpose.
Using it for digital goods and other non-tangible purchases (like services) is the primary transactional purpose.
Using it to buy coffee and tangible goods is a distance second.
Not that we can't go after all these goals at the same time, but many treat these in reverse order.

&lt;over simplification&gt;I no longer agree this is a complex technical debate. This is a development philosophy debate and a psychological debate. Anyone who has created a digital product of any kind (brochure websites, interactive, "apps", devices, etc.) is familiar with the perfectionist vs. the doer, and the conflict that brings. If you're too extreme of a perfectionist, you get nothing done and think you can plan 10 years down the line. If you don't plan at all and you just dive in, you'll spend days/weeks of wasted time fixing errors you made in an early iteration. There's a balance and the perfect lead dev/director understands that and makes decisions based on both trains of thought.
It doesn't help that many (all?) of the vocal technical personalities (Todd, Hearn) and core developers are already wealthy (by most standards). So you combine individualist libertarian ideals, already established wealth, and the conflicting dev philosophies above... and you have a recipe for shit like this happening every 3-6 months. Today it's Mike Hearn, tomorrow it's...

If this isn't already done behind the scenes, I think it would be helpful to start with 2 (more in the future) distinct account separations.
It is common for Internet services companies of all types to make a distinction between personal and business. Perhaps Coinbase should create a clear business tier of service? Business service with Coinbase should come with additional communications, designated representatives and reliable access to live chat.
On a personal level, this is often determined by dollar amount. You could open up additional tiers of service based on either the buy quantity during the life of the account, or the total amount of bitcoin a customer wishes to store in their Coinbase account.
Hell, even Google Adsense contacts you directly and gives you a designated account person once you start making enough money with them.
@_date: 2015-07-30 13:38:14
I disagree with your absolute conclusion. Decentralized currency can be anything it wants, and it is perfectly logical for centralized systems to exist on top of it. They're optional. There are risks being your own bank, and risks trusting Coinbase or Xapo or Bitreserve. As the industry progresses, risks for the individual bank and risks for the centralized wallet-bank should continue to be minimized (that's generally the goal at least).
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:31:19
Is my sarcastic statement false? The few broadband monopolies got their infrastructure in place due to free market utopia principles? We all know that isn't the case. Your response is not grounded in the reality of the lack of competition among ISPs in the United States. But instead, comment on how things could have come about... if only broadband infrastructure in NYC, Chicago, etc. were more 'free market', like Romania or wherever.
Muh roads? More like... "muh internet roads were built through favoritism, municipal backdoor dealings, crony capitalism.. etc.. and now after that is done, we want to allow the tiny handful of ISPs who own those roads to do whatever the fuck they want". So yes, "muh roads".
The problem that fundamentalist free marketers have, is when they think pure free market principles can fix existing crony favoritism that lead to multi-billion dollar companies.
I'm extremely free market with regard to the Internet. And, I admittedly have no solution to this problem; I just know the solution isn't giving Comcast, ATT, Verizon, etc. the ability to push their shitblizzard alternatives to Netflix through the clever bullshit that will inevitably come about in the months/years ahead.

I am not a lawyer nor am I attempting to spark a debate as to whether it 'should' be against Coinbase terms for a legit US account to buy while in an unsupported country. I'm only sharing that this was likely the reason.
EDIT: This does not mean you should lose your money. That is a separate issue, and I'm confident you can work with your bank and even Coinbase to have a refund.

I was talking about how Bitcoin and blockchain tech can be anything. I'm using the word app to describe a consumer facing use. And good ideas grow like wildfires now unlike in the early days of the internet. I did not contradict myself, no one (mainstream) cares about using crypto for anything practical. Even worse, most 'usage' is to increase speculation with the existing financial industry heavily involved.

@_date: 2018-11-25 18:10:59
There are endlessly simple and complex uses of Bitcoin and decentralized architecture. No one gives a fuck. Everyone just wants to hype each other up on Andreas talking points and make money off other people's losses. Simple apps could be mainstream by now, but no one cares. Also, most of the great ideas do not require blockchain or decentralization architecture. Requiring that means you are dependent on a collapse of the current model. Don't delude yourself that existing payment systems can't easily rollout programmable money when it's actually needed.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:09:39
Except crypto/blockchain tech came about on the modern internet, where good ideas and practical apps grow like wildfire. So it's not a fair comparison as the promotional/viral ecosystem is completely different. The reality is no one cares about uses other than getting rich for reasons that are toxic to long-term healthy growth.

This is a horrible article.
You don't propose any solutions? Bitcoin can be anything it wants to be, and every type of party and interest can be involved. Coinbase can exist. LocalBitcoins can exist. Person to person off the fiat-record can exist.
Coinbase exists for those who don't wish to go meet someone for an in-person transaction with fiat, or trade tangible goods/commodities for bitcoin.
If you want a solution that accepts existing non-cash payment systems, it is going to be regulated. And in my opinion, when judging Coinbase within the context of the reality they are operating in, they are doing a great job.
Use LocalBitcoins and go to Starbucks to be off the grid to embrace true Bitcoin philosophy. Or, buy from Coinbase, then transfer them away, and hope that your local government/tax agency doesn't catch up to you.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:22:26
All practical wallets and payment apps allow calculations either direction. So you go to a store, pay someone $3 for a coffee, and you can input it as 3USD and it'll auto-calculate the BTC equivalent below (or vice-versa). Or, as others stated here.. you communicate in a different unit than bitcoin (bits, mbtc, etc.).

You are mathematically correct. I believe OP was pointing out the potential negative impact due to the psychological difference of $10,000 vs. $30 bitcoins. The audience being referenced in this thread is not your experienced trader or investor. It's the moderately technical family/friend, who you introduce to Bitcoin. With the price at $30 per coin, I think it's more common for a new buyer to throw $300 or $600 for 10 or 20 coins. The, the price crashes but the noob is only out $600 if they sell at $1 and give up.
At $10,000 a coin, the psychological need to acquire just 1 whole bitcoin will be great. Especially with a market cap of 144B. $20K or $30K will be the new price target. Now, the noob is selling some stock or dipping into savings they can't afford to lose to buy that single $10,000 coin. Then, the fucker drops to $1,000 and the noob is losing their mind.
Just story telling based on how I read OP's post. This isn't meant to be a generalization of every noob's psychology when buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:17:16
This doesn't make any sense. The calculation isn't right. Perhaps the Javascript calculation bugged out temporarily? Reload page and try again? I just did a sample sell calculation with the small amount of holdings I keep at Coinbase and the math was correct.
EDIT: Clearly not a big deal. The sub-total they're showing is exactly based on 4 bitcoins. So for whatever reason, the ajax calculator disconnected and missed the ".42" BTC. I'm sure it'll be fine on reload and running the numbers again. Good thing you didn't sell, at 493 now :)

Thank you and I actually would like to apologize for my assertive and aggressive language above. I need to chill the fuck out sometimes.
I think your article shows either a lack of understanding, or naivety, to the realities of what it means to buy anything with instant transaction mechanisms we're familiar with.
At some point, fiat has to change hands to get a Bitcoin. There are not many options here...
* Cash in person (for the most part this is anonymous)
* Credit card / debit card (not anonymous)
* Bank transfer of some kind ACH/wire (not anonymous)
That's basically it. Coinbase, or any company like Coinbase that accepts cards or bank transfers for bitcoin doesn't have any choice. And from my perspective, Coinbase is doing an excellent job within the regulated world they choose to operate in. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:43:22


Withdrawing money from your bank account takes time. They need additional options to verify you, and have backup funding, in case the money does not clear your bank. Why should they give you bitcoins instantly if it takes 3 days for them to withdraw money from your account? Also, the blame on that delay is not on them.. but on typical ACH.
