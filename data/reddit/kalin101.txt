Trezor. Any custom fee in terms of sat/byte, the ability to sign the transaction without sending it, locktime and even OP_RETURN. Simply the best. Too bad it costs money though

It's not RBF, I manually double spent it with higher fee

He found a block. The probability is reaaaaly low. He would have gotten 12.5 bitcoins plus all transaction fees but he was mining in a pool so he had to share it with the rest of the members

There is no KYC for running a node. Only for signing up for an exchange. Unfortunately even if you decide to prune the chain you first need to download it all so your node can verify it and then it will delete most of it. You can prune it to 5 or 3 gigabytes for example.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:31:50
I see what you did there
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:50:10
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin's backbone. The software that executes the Bitcoin protocol is called Bitcoin Core. Others also exist like Bitcoin Knots, btcd, bcoin etc. Just like you can access the internet through multiple different browsers (chrome firefox, edge etc) you can access the Bitcoin network through different implementations. Bitcoin Core is the most widely used and adopted one.

There is only so much gold. You can't create any more.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:17:56
Imagine you have a thousand coins and you give them to the bank. They give you one 100 dollar bill or whatever. That's basically consolidating. In Bitcoin you have to pay a fee for every output(every 1 cent coin you have) in order to include it in a transaction. So if someone sent you 0.1 bitcoins it would cost you almost nothing to send them. But if you recieved 0.001 bitcoins a hundred times it would cost you a fortune to do so. That's why when fees are low people consolidate their many outputs by sending everything to themselves. And you end up with one 0.1 bitcoins output instead of 100 0.001 btc output. Yeah Im not good at explaining I hope you understood it lol
@_date: 2019-07-26 23:04:25
That's great!
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:24:32

That's great! Consider running your own blockchain explorer to fully utilize the power of your node!
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:07:05
Satoshi Nakamoto mined it and no there is no back door key. Satoshi has no special power or control over Bitcoin. He created it that way so no one is in charge. It's a distributed system. No one can force you to use a different cryptocurrency. We dont know who Satoshi is because (s)he/they never revealed themselves. I believe Hal Finney is Satoshi Nakamoto, who sadly passed away.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:34:25
Not really. A full node means a fully validating node. Bitcoin Core is such a node. It's possible to prune the blockchain and thus not need 230 gigabytes of storage but I personally think it's nice to have the entire blockchain. That way you also help out new nodes which need to bootstrap the blockchain. For example, when you download Core and run it for the first time you will start downloading the chain from other full nodes. If they didn't exist you would have no way to do that. That's why they are important
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:13:58
Not true. 1 sat fee will not be relayed by most nodes.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:17:46
Just download the latest version of Bitcoin Core and it will automatically connect to peers and download the blockchain which is about 230 gigabytes at the moment.

Im pretty sure if you had malware the attacker would steal your money instead of broadcasting an old state.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:33:52
You are the same person who didn't understand the cheaper fees that come with using segwit so I don't expect you to understand this either. As I said we need balance. I'm telling them to use segwit because segwit transactions are smaller. Which actually means that space is used more efficiently and thus it's easier to run a full node
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:23:19
The mining difficulty is supposed to readjust every 2016 blocks, but due to an error in the code, only the last 2015 blocks are taken into account. A hard fork would be required to fix this (not really serious)  bug.

Your hardware wallets holds your keys. It uses the 24 words + a passphrase to derive them. If only you own the wallet and the backup you are trusting no one. Only you own your keys.
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:07:47
When opening an LN channel the two parties have to agree on what the fee should be for closing the channel. Since we can't predict the future most of the time a very high fee is set to ensure fast confirmations. LN transactions are time sensitive so we can't afford to wait. With this PR merged, fee negotiation is improved which means lower overall fees for us users.

We can't presume that. You are your own bank. With great power comes great responsibility. You must make sure your systems are properly secured. I think losing money due to banks being banks is more common than being hacked and losing crypto
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:03:37
You don't need a gpu. Just a decent cpu (you have it) some RAM and lots of storage. 16GB is better than 8. I run my own Bitcoin + Lightning node on a 1TB seagate,16 gigs and a ryzen 5 2600.  You can use windows. How is your internet speed? Also do you have a monthly cap?
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:19:05
The minimum is 10 sats
@_date: 2019-07-29 08:05:46
You seem like one of those people. I didn't say it's a loss of funds risk. I said the security is reduced slightly. And it's true. Yeah, we should be happy that even without that layer of cryptography Bitcoin is still secure. Take it as an interesting fact. Not everyone knows it so I decided to share it. Why so triggered.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:12:14
25 Mbit/s will be kinda slow for the initial block download but once you are done with that it will be sufficient to run the nodes. Germany is on 2nd place in the world when it comes to Bitcoin nodes count so you'll be contributing even more to your country ;)

It's 1, but with segwit the effective size is around 2MB. The theoretical maximum is 4 I think, but that's not going to be used realistically. So let's say 2.5

Your seed is compromised. Send your coins to another wallet or exchange and create a new seed for your ledger.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:20:37
The transaction is simply bigger. You pay in satoshis/byte. With the smallest fee of 1sat/byte a 250 byte transaction costs 250 sats. For a 8 kB transaction it will cost 8000 sats.
@_date: 2019-07-16 10:38:33
I didn't say it does. But it requires unauthorized access to your machine. If an attacker had that, they could just send all funds to themselves instead
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:52:57
!lntip 400  
To your other question, if you have a lightning node you might still have to pay a fee for some transactions. Most nodes charge 1 satoshi. So if your transaction needs 5 hops to reach its destination you will pay 5 sats in fee. By running your own node though you can also collect fees when you route other people's payments. It's not much but it's still something.
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:27:10
Interesting idea.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:08:24
This is most probably a bug/error and not malicious, but the point is WE NEED FULL NODES. They enforce the rules. They make sure miners don't cheat. Run one. Use Bitcoin independently, the way it's meant to be used, while making the network more resilient. It's a win win.

@_date: 2019-07-16 10:32:55
I love stories of people solo mining blocks. Do you realize how awesome that is? Leave the money aside, you mined a block (or multiple blocks) by yourself! This means you are part of history! Those blocks will most probably always be there on blockchain and every node will download them and store them. You helped strengthening the network and learned about an amazing technology. This is what I call an early adopter. Congratulations man. You should find those blocks and write down their nonces. Those are your lucky numbers

It's private key - public key - address.
Once you spend from and address you also reveal your public key. One layer of security less. Even though most likely it won't be a problem for now
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:31:15
Actually the security is reduced slightly. Once you spend from an address its public key becomes known. To OP's question - no. Spending a 2nd or 999th time won't make it less secure.

They don't yet. However LN is mainly used for microtransactions and small payments anyway. You can store like 5 mBTC on a mobile LN wallet. Even if you lose it which is still unlikely it won't hurt that bad. Mobile wallets = your everyday wallet and hardware wallets = your life savings

Not really. We have larger blocks and we will have even larger ones at some point. What's bad is creating a contentious hard fork (like Bcash) or increasing the blocksize too much. (Again, like Bcash with their 128MB blocks).

That's great. How did you query that?
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:16:00
It's pricey because users agree to pay insane fees. I pay 1 or 2 sats/byte, wait for like a day and get my transaction confirmed for pennies. Besides, swift sucks. Transactions there should be free and instant. But they're not. Bitcoin is way better.

@_date: 2019-07-02 06:10:09
Centralization is not binary. It's a spectrum. Yes, bigger blocks will make Bitcoin more centralized but I doubt a few hundred 2MB blocks would make it completely centralized. We need to find the right balance between decentralization, scaling, privacy and ease of use.

It's incredibly complicated to program good wallets/UI. The users doesn't see any of that. Just presses send/receive.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:18:26
Wallets are the software that handles your private keys and your public addresses. A wallet uses the private key to sign your transaction and broadcast it to the rest of the network. It also listens for incoming transactions associated with your addresses so it updates your balance and notifies you when you recieve a payment. They also derive your private keys from the 12/24 word seed. And much much more. All of that can be done by hand. But a wallet makes it much much easier.
@_date: 2019-07-06 01:32:48

@_date: 2017-12-17 07:43:27
Because it requires a hard fork. That's a difficult and dangerous thing to do. If blocksize was easy to be increased through a soft fork like segwit for example it would be increased for sure.

Your transaction is not "returned". It actually never left your wallet. When you see 1+ confirmations then it has left it. There is no agreed criteria. Everyone decides for themselves and everyone is free to rebroadcast your transaction so it never "returns" to your wallet. You should just double spend it with a higher fee.

No one will want to do that. NO ONE. Even if we increase the supply with 1 satoshi Bitcoin is dead. Because people will say " if they can increase it with 1 satoshi today, they can add 100 million bitcoins tomorrow". And they will be right. We promised a currency with a finite supply. And that's what it will stay. I wont support such a hard fork. No one will.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:18:59
That's an interesting address.
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:05:30
That's how it works. If the cap is reached fees start betting bigger. The bigger the fees the bigger the adoption. But this time it wont be that bad because we have segwit, batching and the LN. When fees start getting bigger it will hopefully push segwit adoption to ~100%
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:28:54
Eventually we will increase it, but for now decentralization is a bigger priority and changing the base block size is too controversial, but yes. If we overdo it, people like you and me might not be able to run full nodes.
@_date: 2018-09-18 22:20:11
Node updated. Everyone should do the same but also it should be noted that this vulnerability most likely won't be exploited because it would cost miners a lot of money and give them bad reputation for nothing really. A few nodes would drop and Bitcoin would be all fine. It's not armageddon. Upgrade and chill. It's all good.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:00:01

I never said I thought it was ready for mass adoption. Bitpay is cancer. They supported segwit2x and force their stupid bip70. It doesn't make crypto more accessible. The exact opposite. It makes it hard to use because you have to decode their payment invoices to get an actual Bitcoin address to send coins to. You don't support Bitcoin if you support shitpay. You seem like someone like Ver. Full of insecurities. That's why you just HAD to mention you were an early adopter even though it's not relevant at all in this convo.

You're either a nocoiner or you bought in December/Jan. "Bubble" hasn't popped, the price is higher than last year. How do you know if it's only gonna decline? Do you have a magic ball?

Ummm what? The point of running your own node and being your own bank is that you don't rely on anyone and you dont trust anyone. Full nodes give you full autonomy. That's how Bitcoin is intended to be used. That's not mining. We aren't talking about profit here. Running a node costs around a buck per month. And if you run a LN node on top of it you can actually earn some satoshis for routing payments.

I owe nothing. BTC is the only valuable coin and this bug is an evidence of that. Any other shitcoin would have been ruined while Bitcoin's price went up when the bug was discovered. Bitcoin is protected by game theory because it has the best reputation and is the most valuable. BCH is just a copy wanna be. No new tech, no nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:21:37
Nope you don't. New bitcoins are generated every ~ 10 mins. That means there is inflation. And that's currently 3.88% per year.

If we increase the blocksize now segwit will never be adopted because everyone will say "fees are low we dont need it". Plus if we are going to HF we should go straight to 8MB. We cant do this every week.

@_date: 2018-09-03 15:53:14
Probably. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:00:19
For one the token of the "other chain" is more than 10 times less expensive and 2) they have no adoption. Blocks are typically ~100kB full. That's nothing. If they had 32MB of TXs in each block you would see the fees go up. Also they have no LN and no segwit so at that point Bitcoin's fees would be lower because TX size would be lower and Bitcoiners would pay less satoshis for the same sat/b rating.
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:41:53
There is no plural of Bitcoin. Bitcoin (capital B) stands for the Bitcoin protocol. Just like you can't say Internets you can't say Bitcoins. However, bitcoin (lowercase b) stands for the currency. The denomination. And in that case the plural of bitcoin is bitcoins. Examples:  
I recommend Bitcoin to my friends.  
I paid 0.012 bitcoins for my purchase.

A private key is kinda like your password. Without it you cant spend the bitcoins associated with the bitcoin address. So analogy:
Email address: bitcoin address. You can share it with everyone so they can send you emails(bitcoins)
Email password: private key. You dont share it with anyone because they can read all your emails (steal all your bitcoins)

No buddy. You didn't pay 0.605 sat/b. You paid 1.00 or more. Blockchain.info calculates fees wrong if SegWit is used. Any fee less than 1.00 satoshis per byte won't get relayed by default so it wont even reach miners. You can however configure your node to relay 0 fee transactions which you should do in my opinion.

@_date: 2018-09-23 21:08:06
Tx size is lower.. the inputs take at least 40% less space than legacy. If everyone uses segwit fees are lower because the txs are smaller.

BIP148 had 2 options to activate segwit.  
1) to make a chain split with at least a decent chunk of the hashpower, mine 2016 blocks to lower the difficulty and then mine more blocks than the legacy chain and thus overwrite it, orphaning all of the blocks mined since the activation of BIP148 and that point of time, and activating segwit. This was a risky approach but desperate times call for desperate measures.  
Or 2)  threaten miners with 1) and make then signal for segwit2x which activated segwit. Then we just had to fight the 2x part which we succeeded at and boom. Segwit is active with no stupid hard forks, all thanks to the UASF BIP148.

A hardware wallet is useful for storing and spending large amount of Bitcoin. Online wallets is something you should avoid. The bitcoins there don't belong to you. They belong to the site. If they get hacked or decide to scam you will lose your coins. You can download a wallet like Samourai Wallet  on your Android phone. Phones are more secure than computers so you should store btc there. With nicehash you can withdraw without paying any fees if you have a Coinbase account. You should do it in my opinion, it's worth it. From coinbase you can transfer to their other site Coinbase pro and from there you can transfer to your wallet for free.

Well here they aren't. Sure you can open one for free but there are transaction fees, monthly fees, service fees, atm withdraw fees, currency conversation fees, international banking fees..�� Bitcoin sounds way better. $0.02 in fees for a 10-20 minute irreversible transaction.

@_date: 2018-08-17 22:05:47
That's your mining software's enforced fee. If you use your own wallet where you control the keys you can choose whatever fee you like. Currently the lowest possible fee (which is 1 satoshi/byte) costs ~ $0.01

Could you elaborate? Their bip70 wallets do just that. They decode it and send the amount to the btc address. My wallet doesn't support bip70 so I use another tool to decode it and send the amount to the address. Bitpay has no way of knowing if the invoice was paid with their wallet or not

why would it matter if people used exchanges as wallets? From bitpay`s point of view, that`d be even better because exchanges always send with a sufficent fee. GDAX (now coinbase pro) even pays the miner fee instead of taking it from the customer.

Being part of the UASF movement was incredible. There were memes of UASF being suicide, we were called crazy, BIP148 was called a Sybil attack. And yet we as a community did it. We forced the miners to signal for segwit and then stopped their malicious 2x attack. And now  1 year later segwit is active, the LN is getting better every day and Bitcoin is stronger than ever. There was no Flippening to Bcash, Bcash didn't overtake as all of the r/btc members were screaming and most importantly we showed the miners that they shouldn't abuse their power because the USERS are in control. Great work, gentlemen.  
Go SegWit, Go LN, Go Consensus!
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:25:54
These fees are pretty low right now. When you send transactions you will see the fee measured in "satoshis per byte" or sat/b. Set that to 1 or the lowest mycelium allows you to. The fee will be ~$0.02. Every time you send a transaction you have to pay those fees. That's why you should use segwit, because it gives you nearly a 50% "discount". What does it mean to have to hold onto a body? Sorry, not a native speaker. But you do not have to do anything for them. It was their choice to send you the btc.

@_date: 2018-08-27 13:13:46
The fancier you get, the more likely you are to screw up. First off you shouldn't be storing private keys. Store a mnemonic seed. 12 or 24 words which can be used to generate all private keys for your wallet. Just write these down on a piece of paper or two and store them somewhere safe and secure. Use a passphrase too if available. I recommend Samourai Wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:39:59
You dont need that. You can set Samourai to sign transactions without sending them. Then you can send an SMS to this number:  
+32460213730  
Copy and paste the signed tx from Samourai into the text field of the SMS and your transaction will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

@_date: 2018-05-02 23:39:48
That's not true though. When we reference the protocol, the payment system, the currency itself we use capital B. Bitcoin. When we reference the the currency denomination we use lowercase b. bitcoin. For example:  
1) Do you accept Bitcoin payments?  
2) That car costs 4 bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:27:51
It's pretty simple. For items under $0.25 use sats. For $0.25  - $1000 mBTC and BTC for everything greater than $1000

Hey, make sure to use SegWit!
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:51:21
Definitely use Samourai wallet if you have an android. Its considered an advanced wallet (not for newbies) but it has excellent features and Im sure you will learn how to use it fairly quickly. The most important thing you want in a Bitcoin wallet is **SEGWIT SUPPORT**. This effectively gives you a "discount" and you pay less fees for transactions.

Hi, and welcome here! First of all try using a wallet that has SegWit addresses. They start with a 3 instead of a 1 or with bc1 instead of a 1. They are way more efficient to transact with! You will pay lower fees to the miners. The best wallet out there for Android is Samourai wallet. If you use windows then download Electrum wallet and beware of phishing sites! After you have a decent wallet you can use Coinbase for buying coins. It's a good user friendly exchange for beginners.
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:00:55
What do you think will happen to that crypto if it ever reaches the adoption of Bitcoin? The exact same thing. Bitcoin is the only crypto, man. Everything else is just a joke. Eth and xmr are interesting. But "other crypto with cheaprr subcent fees" = shitcoin. Bitcoin transactions with 1 sat/byte are getting confirmed. That's $0.01 if you use segwit.

That was like the first two comments. I admitted I was wrong a long time ago 
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:14:50
People either scan a payment request with the address and amount included or they type in the btc amount manually. Why would you need to enter that in fiat? Either way you could still use external resources like preev.com. The users not understand bitcoin volatility is a real problem. I've seen people who were very confused when they sent a payment and their balance went up. They're just not used to it. And then the Samourai devs have to deal with it when the support tickets start flooding in. Honestly it's up to the user but I realized I don't really need fiat in my bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:34:05
Can't wait for the UI. Let's make every spend a coinjoin!
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:15:22
Why do you think using Bitcoin independently is a waste of money?
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:01:14
In my opinion it's good that they removed fiat. It's a bitcoin wallet after all. Your bank doesn't tell you your balance in btc. Payment codes are kind of like addresses, yes. You can share yours without worrying.
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:26:51
What are you talking about exactly?
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:41:54
That's why you have to find the right balance between security and ease. You can't really have both. You don't want to write them down, you don't like the idea of memorizing them either. The other option is to use custodial services, but that defeats the whole purpose.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:52:34
I think you mean not to store them in plain text on your computer or online. If you're that paranoid of someone breaking in your home and stealing your 12 words you can totally memorize them.
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:12:32
That's a great idea! Hopefully they won't think it's a joke and actually try to claim it.

This is amazing! I didn't know it was possible to send payments without an invoice, so yes, this changes everything. Thank you for showing me it! Can it work for cross implementation payments? And actually why were invoices chosen in the first place, instead of something like addresses?

When all bitcoins are mined fees will be the main incentive for miners to mine transactions. Everything will be like it is today, but miners won't mint new coins. They'll just receive the fees. Assuming the protocol stays the same of course.

The normal amount is less than 2MB per ~10 mins for new blocks. That wouldn't cripple any nodes. For the malicious nodes to really do some damage they would need to request historic block data over and over again which would make them stand out from the rest

@_date: 2019-11-02 20:41:24
Yep I tried it. Very nice. You can generate cool addresses like this one:bc1qusetheln8gpkv0yr60xsvx5yed4j8692rs3aux  
Don't store a lot of money there though! And don't forget it hurts your privacy to reuse the same address. Too bad AMD cards can't be used for faster generation. Nvidia only.
@_date: 2019-03-25 21:23:03
Sure. But then you won't have the cool privacy features. As I said it's up to the user. If fiat is that important to you switch wallets. If you need privacy use Samourai/Wasabi

Trezor model T. Nothing wrong with ledger, just my personal preference. Both are secure and reliable but trezor is kinda cooler.

I'm pretty sure whatsat is just a proof of concept and its creator doesn't expect everyone to use it as it is now. The changes you described most probably will be implemented too. If the devs are excited about chatting (which I don't think they are) they might work on this and have it ready in 3 months. If not, it could be years or it could never happen. What I like is that someone showed us that it's possible.

@_date: 2017-08-20 23:42:58
That's not true. Thousands of computers run a bitcoin node. I do. You can. Everyone can. Pools are just the miners. And that doesn't mean centralisation because every miner decides for himself. If the pool starts attacking the network or something the miners will not continue to use them
@_date: 2019-11-11 20:27:53
It would be indeed, but wouldn't that be a red flag for nodes which would then ban it?

Well I learned that sphinx payments are being developed, but if they weren't, why would this be spam? Currently it may be because it's not defined in the protocol, but once it's standardized and used by major node implementations it becomes a valid message.

It doesn't matter how much money you send with bitcoin. You can send 0.0001 btc or 100btc. What matters is how big your transaction is in bytes. The more inputs and outputs the bigger the transaction. An average transaction is 250 bytes so with a fee rate at 30sat/byte you would have to pay 0.000075 BTC or about 30 cents.

@_date: 2017-08-27 00:06:18
There's nothing wrong with bigger blocks, but they are not practical. You can't scale only with big blocks. If the entire planet switched to Bitcoin the blocks would have to be like 10 gigabytes. The blockchain is already big and takes days to be downloaded. Imagine it 8x times bigger if we made the blocks 8MB. Now imagine that in 20 years. How would the average person be able to keep a copy and run a full node? This will seriously harm decentralisation. The only nodes will be in data centers and we have paypal 2.0 Small blocks are the way to go.
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:21:34
First of all, thank you for the detailed explanation. I get what the attack is, but I think theres one thing youre missing which makes the attack really inefficient/almost impossible. the maxconnections parameter controls the total number of connections. However in reality this only limits the incoming connections. A node won't connect (make outgoing connections) to more than 8 or a few more peers. My node right now has 10 outgoing and 101 incoming connections. I don't think its possible to connect to many peers without modifying the code. So each attackers node would connect to 10 nodes, then 2000 attacker nodes times 10 connections is only 20000 connections and not millions. Please correct me if Im wrong.

This has nothing to do with dandelion or transaction broadcasting. It's about linking addresses together 
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:04:15
There are no main and secondary addresses. All addresses are equal and should be used only once to receive a certain amount and once again, to spend it. Think of an address as an invoice number rather than an account number.

STONEWALL basically makes a tx look like a coinjoin tx. 2 inputs and 2 outputs. You can't be sure which address is sending coins to which. It obfuscates the tx and breaks the deterministic link between inputs and outputs on the blockchain. The downside is that with more inputs and outputs, the tx gets bigger and thus you have to pay more in fees.

Why did you censor that? No need. You are commenting in the Bitcoin sub. Bitcoin is famous for its censorship resistance and you censor a word that's not even inappropriate. This shouldn't be considered a "bad" word. Or any word really. My 2 cents.

The more I understand about our current monetary system the more I wonder.. who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give the right of printing money to a handful of people? Money should represent value. You can't print value just like that. And the best part? If a citizen makes even $5 and is caught will be totally fucked and put in a cage, where as the government can print trillions, fuck up a whole country (Venezuela) and face no consequences.

He is not Satoshi. (My opinion of course)
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:42:15
You need to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:34:17
I think you must decrypt it first.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:44:46
That sounds pretty useful. What programming language will you be using? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:48:18
Nice acc, Ver.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:14:39
In that case I would recommend cashing out as much as you need to cover your initial investment and then HODL that GODL!

Bitcoin is the Internet of money.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:42:57
You could return it to the address you got it from.
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:23:41
Nope. Invalid means it breaks consensus rules. Besides, the fact that a transaction is not relayed doesn't mean it's not accepted by miners. If you contact a mining pool and give them like 20 bucks they will mine your 0 fee transaction. Same goes for non standard txs
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:29:56
Bitcoins are not green. You have 21m ecocoins.

Nope segwit locks in today. 2016 more blocks (2 weeks) before activation 
@_date: 2018-10-25 06:31:25
This is really an amazing idea. It would help so much to get a friend or someone else involved. They don't even need a wallet at first. I could just send them a small amount with Biterica and show them the power of Bitcoin. Once I get them on board, they will download a wallet themselves! Thanks for making this tool and helping with adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:53:59
Mining bitcoin* shitcoin mining is still profitable. And then you can exchange it for btc

Bip141 is locked in right?that was the goal. Success.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:16:02
As more and more people adopt it the volatility decreases. Ultimately we will stop using USD and everything will be priced only in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:55:43
Use localbitcoins or find a Bitcoin ATM (BTM). Good luck!

There were some security issues 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:53:38
Segwit yeah. Segwit2x no no no.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:17:31
What causes malleability and how is it possible? I thought if you change a single bit of the transaction then it will require a completely new signature.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:15:44
1mb to 2mb non witness data. 4 to 8 with segwit.
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:56:03
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:38:55
Yep. I really don't like BCH but it's just dangerous to use it at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:33:53
And that kids is why you don't fork off with economic minority and shitty devs.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:35:49
Every 2 weeks the difficulty adjusts. 95% of time it goes up because more miners are joining. That means that you will be making less and less each month until you cant cover the electricity cost and you are stuck with an expensive heater

Nice idea for a meme
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:30:55
I think the default time is 2 weeks. After 2 weeks most nodes will drop your transaction from the mempool. It would look as if you never sent it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:45:02
There will ever be only 21 million bitcoins. You sir just lied.

It depends on many things like the cost in your country how power hungry your system and gpu is and the efficiency of the power supply. For me it's $12 a month if I let it mine 24/7 which is not always so $10 maybe.

I think so. No matter how slim the chances are it's worth it. You are probably not making more than a few cents a day so you might as well go for the big bucks. And make sure to add something cool in the coinbase text.

Maybe you need to update/flash the firmware online on load the web wallet there but the setup is offline. The seed is shown on the device itself and you enter the pin on it too. None of that touches the internet 
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:58:47
Don't tell them a word about Bitcoin though. Just tell them you have personal info you really want and also  tell them not to wipe the phone/factory reset it!

@_date: 2017-08-21 12:01:18
1.You can buy them.
2. You can accept them for goods and services.
3. You can mine then.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:40:59
That's nice. Probably you could make it 0 for disabled and people will only enable it when they send/ recieve transactions so It doesn't spam.

Only trolls who want to spread FUD and propaganda about their big blocks say that segwit is a bug. Segwit is one of the best upgrades for Bitcoin. The code has been tested and has been even running on Litecoin for quite some time now.

Short for segregated witness. Basically an update which will allow more transactions to be confirmed and thus lower fees. It also fixes some bugs and allows for future scaling.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:57:29
The bitcoin protocol doesn't care about identity, or legal ownership. Private keys are literally the only thing you need to have. If you don't have them, you don't have the bitcoin. Period.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:55:04
False. Never in bitcoin history somebody was happy because  he sold.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:55:43
Use localbitcoins or find a Bitcoin ATM (BTM). Good luck!

I thought that too
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:28:55
Genius ikr

I will be running one too. 0 fees. Andreas Antonopoulos said he will do it too.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:39:43
The fees are stupidly high though. If mycelium adds custom fees it will be the greatest wallet ever.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:08:54
The pizzas were 2.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:29:24
Im talking long term. Segwit alone is not a scaling solution. It will maybe help us untill the price is 10k. And then when all of the new players come the blocks will be full again
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:13:46
What the hell are "faster signatures"?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:21:32
So true. Upvote to the moon and beyond!
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:53:06
You also lost 87% of the hash power :) Oh yeah consensus doesn't mean anything. Bye.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:44:01
Or just sign a message like normal people.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:31:09
Exactly. That's not your average project. Billions are at stake.
@_date: 2018-10-31 23:20:32
Sounds like a great wallet but why no android though..  computers are way less secure and definitely less practical to use

Any arguments? Bitcoin has all the properties of money. It was designed that way.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:03:18
Not likely but possible. it's like playing the lottery every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:55:30
Mine solo. If you find a block you will be jumping higher than bcash's difficulty.

Oh he was just explaining how you should control your private keys or else it's not your bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:24:39
Im pretty sure Bulgaria has lost the keys to the bitcoins they confiscated. Good for hodlers.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:57:04
I don't think there is an easy way to do this. Your wallet should tell you how much the fee is before you send the transaction. You can divide it by the satoshi per byte you have set and you will get the size.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:37:59
First you need to convince everyone to update their software with your lines of code and second that's still not inflation because you are just dividing already existing money.
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:14:04
It's true that you should fuck it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:33:14
Yes. No sarcasm at all. Those coins are YOURS.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:37:44
The lowest possible. Electrum goes to 30sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:16:51
Nope. That's why I said I need to move there. Im from Bulgaria.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:04:02

But how? They close at 5
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:00:47
I would do it for free. Andreas said he would too.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:40:43
Your node is in "passive mode." You will download new blocks but you wont broadcast them to the rest of the network. So for example if I wanted to download the blockchain I wouldnt be able to do so from your node. (I hope my info is right if not please someone correct me)
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:59:25
Dont you dare to mine bcash! And i think they dont use workers just point your miner there and use default for worker name
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:41:56
Great idea.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:43:47
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:43:34
Still waiting for the day when mycelium will implement custom miner fee. That would be the best  mobile wallet ever.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:42:43
Please add RBF and the option to sign messages 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:23:23
 Satoshi said that bitcoin is the longest valid chain. Your chain is not only 1000+ blocks behind but is also invalid to the majority of users because it doesn't satisfiy the rule for the max block size. Not bitcoin by any means. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:24:23
You are concerned that something might go wrong with segwit? Impossible. It has been tested and Litecoin has been using it since months.

Yeah. Not a good currency because it's not divisible, easily transportable nor scarce but if people were fine with that it could be used. Even pokemon cards which kids trade are currency :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:49:18
Replace by fee. This is a feature that allows you to bump the fee to an already broadcast transaction so you are still save with using a low fee and you can always speed up the transaction if you need to.

Don't use blockchain.info as a wallet. It's not reliable. For android I can recommend Electrum(ugly interface but it has custom fees) or Mycelium(the best interface with many features but the fees are kinda high).
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:17:58
There are no SMS backdoors. The coin join is fake but it increases privacy. A wallet with that is better than one without it
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:28:24
So every segwit address starts with a 3 like the multisig ones? Dang. I liked 1 better.

Sure but we can always upgrade from SHA. Your coins are safe.
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:18:22
That's what I told myself when I saw my earnings are $2.20/day. Then I thought... 4 years ago people were pissed that they "only" earn 0.25btc a day. And now that's a lot. So i will keep on mining and hodl. After a few years it will be worth it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:55:18
Download nicehash miner. You are not going to mine bitcoin but you are going to be paid in bitcoin so it's no difference for you.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:27:28
Yep, me too
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:39:59
I had this problem. I don't know about mac but on windows you need to create an inbound rule to let the OS accept connections through port 8333. Do macs have a firewall? If yes then add a rule.
Edit: turning the firewall off won't help. You need to add the rule.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:29:21
Not entirely true. If an attacker tries to 51% attack the chain he would need 300MH/s more now.

"Legally". I prefer to have control over my property  (in this case money) instead of relying on someone else to handle that. I can make a transaction in a few minutes with my private keys. Law might take years to give me back my money.

Be prepared to wait though. 24 hours at least.

I think you are right but we can't be sure. Bitcoin as of now is ready for 10MB blocks imho. As Andreas Antonopoulos said we will implement everything to scale. We will have both segwit and LN and bigger blocks. It's just a matter of time. Your Idea for at least temporarily upping the max block size is great actually.

@_date: 2017-08-26 22:14:21
My 30 satoshi/byte transaction was confirmed.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:44:24
This works. I always use 10sat/byte and then accelerate it here. You have to do it at exactly 1, 2 3 o clock and so on. When you see 12:59 type the tx ID and as soon as you see 1:00 hit send. You have like 10 seconds to go through.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:17:49
Good job man! Keep hodling 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:10:34
That's right man. Bitcoin has always worked unlike some *ahem* other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:43:07
Just use 1 satoshi/byte fee and try the viabtc tx accelerator until it gets picked up.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:15:46
Not true. Like 1 kilometre is 1000 meters and 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts 1 KB is 1000 bytes ( and 1mb=1000kb respectively ). 1 mebibyte is 1024 kibibytes. You are confusing them. Ask google for more info.

Ok now that I look at it, the post really sounds shady lol. Sorry about that and thanks for helping me. Next time I'll make sure to word it better. Yeah that is my personal explorer and I was just scrolling through the unconfirmed txs and came across those ones. I am connected to a few other 0 fee tx relaying nodes so I guess the transactions propagated to my node, but not to any other explorers.

There is enough time until then. You can be 100% sure it will happen

The fork itself is nothing bad. That's the beauty of open source projects. You don't like it? Just fork it so it suits your needs. The real problem is that instead of friendly forking off and going their way, they did (and still do) everything possible to attack Bitcoin and fool noobs that Bcash is the real Bitcoin and that Bitcoin is being "crippled" by  blockstream, banks and what not.

A miner decides which transactions to include. They can add none. In most cases empty blocks are found seconds after the last one and miners don't have enough time to process their mempools. Such blocks are not a bad thing. They improve security for everyone

There you go buddy
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:37:39
True, however you need to reach the difficulty adjustment first. With a very drastic drop that may happen after a year. And the difficulty can only go up and down by a factor of 4. So even if it becomes 4 times easier it would still take a lot of time for the next readjustment. I think a hard fork would be the only way if let's say 95% of the miners quit. It's also possible that individual miners and users like you and me help with their hashpower though.
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:54:59
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:27:06
Nice idea. Btw, this is a Bitcoin address and not a public key. Great vanity one though!
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:16:10
Bitcoin is decentralised. There is no website/server you can hack. It's a distributed ledger and is stored on thousands of computers participating in the bitcoin network. To "hack" it you would need to change the copy on every single computer which is impossible. The creator has no more power than the average user like me and you.

This private key could be compromised. You took a pic of it and then hid the private key part. That means the original picture has probably touched an internet connected device.

Honestly I think even if the Core devs release those we still wouldn't be able to use it immediately. Remember the battle segwit vs unlimited? And then the activation of segwit which took like a month? All of this and then we didn't have wallets supporting segwit when it launched.
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:34:58
True. No one uses it though. It's even shittier than Bcash
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:56:09
True. Litecoin is basically Bitcoin with lower block times and a little bigger blocks. They also have segwit. Good opponent.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:33:22
It is true. If you don't hold the private keys those bitcoins are not yours. You have a promise that you will receive them. But only a promise. If the exchange goes down like mt gox or btc-e you can say adios to your coins. And yeah the bank analogy is the same. When you deposit some it's no longer yours. It's the banks'. If they or the government decide that the money shouldn't be yours then there's not much that you can do.

You don't lose the coins if you lose the device. The device just signs your transactions so your coins dont get stolen (viruses, malware). You can always recover your coins with the 12/24 word seed you backed up and stored in a secure location.

The target hash is recalculated every 2016 blocks or about every 2 weeks. If the average time between blocks is more than 10 minutes, the difficulty decreases. If it's less than 10, it increases.

There's no reason to be using legacy addresses anyway. So if Im understanding this correctly, a transaction with 100 inputs and one with a single input will be the same size? If it is so, then this is huge!

There's a difference between waiting for one block and waiting for a confirmation. OP is asking about the former.
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:04:52
Thank you for taking the time to research this. This is what I mean though - Look at this this random transaction with 4 inputs. It's about 4 times bigger than a tx with just one input, which means the separate signatures are somehow combined (serialized?) into a single structure. 
So it's logical that each private key signs its input, but what signs the output(s)? All of them?

@_date: 2019-08-02 13:28:40
Your points about it possibly being a scam are valid. I would be cautious too. So how would you advise to structure this post? You are not seeing the txs because your node probably doesn't relay 0 fee transactions and thus those were not accepted to your mempool.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:12:18
Nice! Have you noticed your best share? How close have you gotten to mining a block?
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:23:26
Thank you for the detailed answer. I didn't think Core would allow you to sign a tx with a spent UTXO. So replacing a rbf tx doesn't require signaling anything special? Will any tx that uses the same UTXO as the rbf signaling transaction take its place in the mempool? Sorry I worded this badly. Hopefully you can understand me lol

Do you know what a full node is? Dojo is the what connects your Samourai Wallet to your own Bitcoin node. If you use Dojo you use Bitcoin the way it's meant to be used - fully independently and trustlessly. Using Dojo grants you maximum security (certainty) and privacy since the Samourai servers don't even know about your wallet.

I mean a non contentious hard fork.
@_date: 2019-10-05 10:44:32
I think such a transaction is considered non standard. That means nodes will not broadcast it. That doesn't mean it's not valid though. Create a raw transaction and send the hex to a mining pool. They might charge you some btc for the service, but they will mine your transaction.
@_date: 2019-10-15 04:55:35

You could try 0 fee. My node would relay your transaction but there's no guarantee that others will. If it reaches a miner it could eventually be confirmed.

The input is non standard (as far as I understood) and currently you are having problems spending it, or more precisely broadcasting the transaction. When you spend it, you will do it to a standard address. Once the transaction is confirmed you will be able to spend the new output like normal.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:21:31
Bad idea imo. We need sufficient blocksize on the base layer to open and close LN channels. Why don't we focus on the new signature schemes like Schnorr and the other good stuff like Graftroot instead of making controversial changes like lowering the blocksize?

Most likely you will have to construct a raw transaction. Mycelium used to support creating and signing of 0 fee txs. I don't know if they still do. You can use the console in Bitcoin Core or a site like   
It's too much hassle for every day use. You can try it for fun though. Or if you have a transaction with many many inputs. Otherwise just use a native segwit address (starting with bc1), set the fee to 1 sat/byte and wait. Still pretty cheap.  
If you like low fees (and we all do) then consider trying the LN. You have to tinker a bit to get a daemon working but it's worth it and you will feel great for accomplishing it.

I'm not sure if you're asking redditors what they do or if you want to learn how you can help the space yourself. Either way, you can educate people and answer their questions; Run a full node to 1) use Bitcoin fully independently, the way it's meant to be used and 2) to decentralize the network further and help new nodes bootstrap.  
You can also contribute to open source projects you like. Wallets for example or Bitcoin Core itself. You don't need to be a programmer. You can help by writing documentation, reviews, testing new versions and reporting bugs. You can also help with translations if you speak more languages.

That's another nice difference between banks and Bitcoin. Push vs pull systems. With banks the merchant pulls as much money as they want from your account. In Bitcoin you have to send as much or as little as you want. No one else can touch it. No one makes decisions for your money except you.

Running a Bitcoin node means using Bitcoin the way it's intended to be used. Only by running your own node can you trustlessly and independently verify transactions and blocks. Privacy is also increased. You can estimate fees on your own because you have your own mempool. You can interact with the blockchain without trusting anyone else!
 Honestly, a node is much much more helpful to you, then it is to the network as a whole. Sure, decentralization would be increased and you could help other nodes bootstrap, but at the end of the day Bitcoin could keep running greatly without your or my node. People run nodes mainly for their own sakes. 
Besides, running a lightning node on top of your Bitcoin node allows you to use the LN which is amazing, instant and very cheap. You can even collect fees for routing payments.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:50:14
Use OP_RETURN. Or, if you can't do that go to 
And create an address with the characters of your hash. If the hash is too big you can split it into multiple outputs. Send 546 sats to each of the addresses. Boom.
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:31:40
I consider myself pretty well educated on the technical side of things about Bitcoin, but this is still unclear to me. Let's say you have a transaction with 3 inputs, 3 different private keys. What does each key sign? How are the 3 different signatures combined into one final signed raw transaction?

I don't support the idea. We need to find balance between usability and decentralization. 1MB blocks make the chain 200+ GB. That's a lot, but fees are still sometimes high and the mempool reaches 25k translations. Lowering the blocksize would make things even worse. Not to mention how controversial it is. Let's not turn into Bcash. We have segwit, we have the LN, schnorr is probably also on the roadmap somewhere. Let's focus on that.

Not true. Miners cant censor your transactions. Besides you can be a miner too.

That's because there is a lot of speculation. Bitcoin is whatever people think it is. Some use it for speculation as a commodity, others for currency. Why not both? Everyone decides for themselves

That's why you should verify. When you first open mycelium write down the seed and double check. Uninstall mycelium. Install again. Input 12 words and if you are able to restore it then you can send btc to it.

They also have no segwit and thus no transaction malleabillity fix, no asic boost fix and no bech32. Oh also no schnorr sigs. And smart contracts(rootstock). Bcash is basically a shitcoin with Bitcoin's name.

Do not install anything else. It's going to steal your coins!
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:41:59
I have just one question. Why the fuck do people use blockchain.info? Seriously a Mycelium wallet is way more convenient (because you can scan QR codes and you always have your phone if you want to make a transaction) and probably a million times more secure than that web wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:37:31

Not a stupid decision imo. Many noobs get confused because of fiat. It's a bitcoin wallet after all. Not a fiat one. Paypal doesn't show your balance in btc.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:21:47
The nonce has its own predetermined place in the block header. Here is what a header looks like in JSON format:
"hash": "000000000000000000258bae7e83488c2e359239a18324330b844a6ca47e4434",
  "confirmations": 2,
  "height": 581608,
  "version": 536870912,
  "versionHex": "20000000",
  "merkleroot": "3dd39dbfe20cebfd046ab2bc6069da0a24b61efe3dedbb1acaff10567b923820",
  "time": 1561047088,
  "mediantime": 1561043087,
  "nonce": 385745717,
  "bits": "1725fd03",
  "difficulty": 7409399249090.253,
  "chainwork": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000006c53cd028c03ba3a1b79a01",
  "nTx": 1654,
  "previousblockhash": "00000000000000000011c13ff0d01abb1b20409d3448cf0de95d7fd3866aaf21",
  "nextblockhash": "00000000000000000010d0aa237ab85c1832b8b4ab9061bd4d37539c202d7b23"
There is a nonce field, and that's where the nonce goes. You can't just put it at a random place. Furthermore, putting it in 3 different places would result in 3 different hashes. The number itself is the nonce. Every block needs a different solution (nonce) to make valid proof of work. A valid nonce for my block most probably won't be be valid for yours.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:05:14
Does it start with a 3? It should work. Bug eventually you can try legacy
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:27:47

No. They can buy a cookie from subway for 0.0003 coins or something. The smallest amount of Bitcoin that can be currently sent is a satoshi. 100 million satoshis are 1 Bitcoin. So micro transaction are still possible. You can buy a gum with Bitcoin if you wanted to.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:24:22
I think they hide that on purpose to simplify user experience. You can't open channels manually. Autopilot does it for you.
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:46:24
I think one such project existed but then died out. A browser mining website with instant withdraws through the Lightning Network. A user could go and mine 3 sats and have them in his wallet instantly!
@_date: 2019-10-04 03:52:29
What's encoded in the qr code? You need a new invoice for each payment over the LN
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:28:18
Not really since you have to run it on a computer. Hardware wallets &gt; mobile wallets &gt; desktop wallets &gt; web wallets 
In terms of security
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:54:39
The solution is very simple.  You keep the private key too. If one day they lose it you could spend it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:17:39
Exactly. The more people who see about Bitcoin the better. They might not understand this post but they also might come to the sub to check it out.
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:17:23
Let me clarify that it's highly recommended not to reuse addresses, but you would still get your coins if you ever did do that. If you have to choose between reusing an address and not getting paid you can reuse it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:02:19
Wrong. Never stop dreaming.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:32:18
In September I was asking myself. How likely it is for Bitcoin to hit 5k for Christmas? That would be a nice gift. Well. Thanks Satoshi!

This is huge and doesn't have anything to do with price.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:44:06
Dont listen to the others :) it's great you thought of that. Every hash per second less will help Bitcoin with lower difficulty 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:36:01

Thanks man. And dont forget it's still not too late to jump in. Bitcoin is a risky investment, but its still in its infancy. It has lots of room for growth. Do your research and make the right decision. Never invest more than you can afford to lose and HODL!

@_date: 2019-06-20 16:00:40
Basically you need to understand how the sha256 algo works. So maybe use that as keywords for your searches. Once you know that, your computer performs billions of these hashes with a different nonce until it finds one that satisfies the current difficulty. Besides the nonce, a miner also includes new transactions (for example with higher fees). This way he maximizes profit and varies the block all together in order to find a valid hash.
@_date: 2019-02-16 10:07:05
The minimum is 10 or 20 sats I think. You can't send 1 sat with lntip

This info you collected and the things you learned are a million times more useful than a whole school year.
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:34:15
There is also a security problem with reusing an address, but it's not serious at all and you shouldn't worry about it too much. If you reuse an address your public key becomes known. Even though it's public, you shouldn't share it with others. In theory, if the cryptography that generates public keys out of private keys is one day broken, someone could steal your coins on the reused address. That's not likely to happen though.
By reusing, here I mean sending more than once from the same address. Just receiving multiple translations to the same address does not reveal your public key (assuming you have never spent anything from the address).
So to sum up, reusing introduces a slight security problem. Reusing addresses also hurts your privacy. It'd be best if you used a new address for every new transaction. Preferably bech32 (bc1..) or at least P2SH SegWit (3...)
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:10:26

@_date: 2017-11-01 15:19:22
Visa is centralised. In Bitcoin you sacrifice speed and efficiency for decentralisation, full control and freedom. Scaling takes time. One day Bitcoin will do more than Visa. Give it time. But I dont think it's that slow/ expensive. I wanted to sell some btc for cash. I send the coins for $0.50 fee. The tx takes 4 hours to confirm. They exchange sends me the money via bank transfer. The bank charges me  $1.10 and takes a day and a half for the transaction to go through. In my opinion Bitcoin is still cheaper, faster and way more convenient than Banks.
@_date: 2019-06-13 12:07:26
21 million BTC / 7 Billion people equals 3 mBTC per person on average. You have more than 33 times of that amount. I would say it is an achievement.

Of course. It was just an example. No one can mine with a pen or even a high end PC. The point is anyone could be a miner. There is no central control.

I saw a post where someone wanted a little btc for paypal. I hate paypal and I don't use it but I wanted to help him and introduce him to the world of Bitcoin so I agreed. He sent me the money thru paypal and everything was perfect. 
After that u/Xylemup messaged me because they wanted btc too. I sent it, it took 2 days to confirm and I haven't heard back from him since then. Soon after that u/jfjenson warned me that u/Xylemup charged back his transaction. I knew it was too late but I thanked him. He said he needed btc too and showed me his rep as a "trusted trader". We communicated on telegram. After the btc tx confirmed he deleted it. He wanted me to send 1/3 of the total amount. Good thing I did 1/10.
There are definitely good people who won't scam you here, but the risks are just too big.

Seems pretty easy to me. You want a channel with 5 mBTC? Open one with 10, then send 5 back to yourself on chain (via atomic swaps or some exchange) and now you have a channel with 5 mBTC + inbound capacity.

I know coinbase is not the most Bitcoin friendly exchange and I'm aware about the shit they've been pulling off, but still if a merchant uses coinbase commerce you would be punishing the merchant, not coinbase itself. When it comes to accepting payments coinbase is light years ahead of shitpay. You could complete your payment with coinbase and still notify the merchant that there are better choices. However totally avoiding coinbase powered merchants seems too radical too me. If you wanna boycott them simply don't use them.

 I think the article implies that the attackers used rbf. True, it's not impossible, but very hard for the average joe. Especially without rbf. If we had consensus on the mempool we probably wouldn't need the blockchain (right?)

It's definitely possible. You shouldn't accept unconfirmed RBF transactions. Wait for a confirmation or two. Alternatively if the purchase is small enough, you could accept the unconfirmed tx and ban the customer if they abuse it and double spend.

+1 for ditching blockchain.com. Horrible "wallet". And yeah, if you use a wallet you should enter just the amount you want your merchant to receive. If you're using an exchange the fee will be deducted from the send amount so you should input more than you intend to send. Btw Coinbase Pro has free withdraws.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:44:15
The blocksize has to and will be increased. The question is when. We should be doing everything we can to scale. Both soft and hard forks, on and off chain etc.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:30:21
Bitcoin uses both RIPEMPD160 and SHA256. So it's the perfect balance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:38:42
Not really. Bitcoin was the first. Its the most recognised one. Its the most used one. Hundreds of great devs are working on it. Many new technologies are being implemented like rootstock which will allow smart contracts (like ethereum) on the Bitcoin network. LN is also coming. Bitcoin is the deal. Other cryptos are just too small. Their price is pure speculation. I mean almost no obe understands Bitcoin, let alone other small cryptos like Monero or Ethereum or Dash etc.
@_date: 2019-12-28 22:12:46
Apples and oranges.  I wouldn't say it's true either btw. Declined cards, unpredictable fees, chargebacks, denied transactions from the banks, account freezings, unknown exchanges rates which often rip the customer off (assuming that a different currency is used) all contribute to a bad UX with banks.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:09:49
Make automatic payments each month for example. Maybe it will be possible with the help of smart contracts.

That's not so bad mate. A raspberry pi takes ~40 days. And yes, the further you go, the harder it becomes because blocks get fuller. The early blocks are empty and quick to validate. Blocks after maybe  000 are pretty slow to verify.

I wouldn't mess with it either, just curious.

You absolutely can. You can even mine with a pen and a sheet of paper. And no miners cant block any transactions attach a fee and someone will take it. Easy as that.
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:35:37
There is no official site because no one owns or controls Bitcoin. The best one imo is: btcinformation.org
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:10:02
Bitpay is the one using non standard software. They use the shitty BIP70 which only a few wallets support. It was recently removed from Bitcoin Core too. Why? Because BIP70 sucks and breaks Bitcoin's logic. Bitpay should not be dictating the rules. Bitcoin should be dictating the rules for bitpay. It's not that wallets are not supported by bitpay. Bitpay just doesn't support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:23:58
Samourai is better imo
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:06:55
Shitpay sucks but coinbase is fine.
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:14:09
A bigger blocksize wouldn't hurt that much, but the process of achieving that would. The hard fork itself is the controversial part imo. But yeah, with bigger blocks raspberry pi's for example wouldn't cut it. We'd need more powerful machines, fast internet and more disk space. Those are not a problem for some people. However, we want Bitcoin to be available for everyone. But then again most newbies have a mobile wallet. They don't run nodes. And if fees go too high, that makes Bitcoin unusable for them. So in the end, bigger blocks would increase centralization a little, but lower fees too. That would help adoption. With more adoption more people will be educated on the subject and will run nodes which will help with decentralization. I personally think it's a good idea to raise the blocksize to let's say 8MB. Hard forking wouldn't be easy though.
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:03:30
Why US only?
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:57:26
Which mobile app? Do you mean you use Trezor with your phone? That's great but you need to carry it with you, connect it every tine you wanna send and enter the PIN by looking at the grid on the trezor itself. It's slower than using a mobile wallet but really secure if that's what you do. Most wallets have a PIN. Some require you to enter it just once when you open the wallet and then you can send as much as you want. Personally not a fan of that.

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:01:42
TXs under 500 bytes are for free.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:48:08
I always use 1 Satoshi/byte for a fee. 3-4 cents. It gets confirmed within 24 hours. Stores wont make you wait for a confirmation. And if you need a priority transaction you will have to pay 70-80 cents. $4 is overpaying a lot. Bitcoin is working great for microtransactions at the moment but only for those who know how to use it. After some time things will be easier and the average user will be able to do it without any hassle at all.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:13:03
It's definitely possible to encode amount and address in the qr codes. Their setup just wasn't that good.
@_date: 2019-12-25 10:39:22

@_date: 2019-12-20 20:03:11
Bitcoin recalculates its difficulty for mining every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks), but due to a bug which Satoshi himself introduced only the last 2015 blocks are taken into account. Every node software now has to intentionally add the same bug or else the network would split.

It is! Each node decides for itself what the fee policy is. My node relays 0 fee transactions and I'm connected to another node that also does this. If you're lucky and broadcast through my node your transaction could eventually reach a miner and be included in the blockchain for free!

That's a raw transaction. A hex string that encodes it. It can be used to broadcast it at a later time for example. you can manually create a raw transaction if your wallet is not advanced enough for your needs and then broadcast it to the Bitcoin network.

Well RBF simply replaces the old tx in the mempool so it's not safe to accept unconfirmed RBF tx's. No one should be doing it. If they don't, that risk is mitigated. How can one configure a node to forward all transactions regardless of rbf or double spending? But still that doesn't matter if the miners don't have the same config as well.

That's not a raw transaction as far as I know. A raw transaction is a big hex string. You can create it with a wallet or manually and keep the hex text. That way, you can broadcast it at a later date.

If there's some space in the block it could happen. Also I have a theory that there are some very nice miners out there that mine 0 or low fee transactions to help people. My 0 fee transaction was mined in November/December of 2017 when the fees were up to the sky.

@_date: 2019-12-23 10:21:33
When the difficulty was way lower the nonce alone allowed for enough hashes to find a valid PoW. Now that it's so high the nonces are exhausted in under a second as you said. Besides the timestamps, miners add more transactions constantly which also changes the block.
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:14:07
It matters because a non rbf unconfirmed tx is way safer than an rbf one. Rbf is easy. Even wallets allow it. It's a feature. We were talking about replacing a tx in the mempool that's not marked as replaceable. (When you or someone else said that miners often do it for profit)  
 I never said we should work towards mempool consensus. I simply said that we need the blockchain because there's no no consensus on the mempool. Mempools in fact, as there's not a single one.

I meant it's not safe to hand a customer a product or ship something to them if the tx is rbf and unconfirmed. Thank you for the detailed information. I'll check the video out. Do you think it's better to leave your node as it is or set it up to relay double spending transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:32:25
That's an xpub and not an address. You shouldn't share it because anyone who knows it can see your entire transaction history and your total "balance"
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:22:57
Do you think Bcash's 0-conf is safer because they don't have rbf and the blocks are empty? The one reason I think double spending could be legitimate is if you're at a gunpoint, you are forced to send out all of your btc and then you want to try to get it back for example. Sadly the network can't distinguish between that and a user trying to scam a merchant.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:49:57
Nodes would reject a conflicting transaction. You would need special help like a miner who is willing the drop the old tx from their mempool and accept the new one for example.

@_date: 2019-04-24 21:44:00
I've never made assumptions about it. I said I tried it and it doesn't work. I get an error (mempool conflict) and I'm not able to broadcast the new tx. After flushing the mempool I can broadcast it, but other nodes don't accept it because the old tx is still in their mempools. The new tx can't be seen on block explorers. The only way I know is with rbf. It would be extremely difficult to do it without rbf.

Exodus is a newbie wallet in my opinion. At the moment you can't just send a lightning payment to me. First I need to give you an invoice which then you can pay. Im not sure if that's by design or simply hasn't been developed enough yet. If I'm not mistaken, devs are working on spontaneous LN payments.

How come it's only available in the US? An app is a piece of software. It can run in the US, in Europe, in Africa etc. It doesn't matter where you run it. If your product is more like an exchange or a custodial account then that's not a Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin is borderless.

Not really. Bitcoin could theoretically work over radio waves. It's just a protocol. We decide how to implement it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:48:18
Not a new coin but a new block. Currently that's 12.5 bitcoins and this amount halves every 4 years. When a miner finds a hash that satisfies the difficulty condition 12.5 bitcoins are created and the transitions in that block are now confirmed. You cant mine a single coin. Either 12.5 or none.
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:32:35
Well you mentioned wordlists. There are no wordlists for passphrases. Only for HD wallets
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:07:30
Damn corruption 
@_date: 2018-11-02 23:35:58
Wrong seed/passphrase then. It would have shown a transaction that spent his coins.
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:28:37
That would be a hard fork which no one would support.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:46:55

@_date: 2018-11-14 04:44:20
Why the hell would you send a large amount of btc to a new wallet you haven't tested? Send 10 cents, wipe the wallet and then see if you can access it again using your seed and passphrase. That's the only way to be sure that your seed/passphrase is correct. Once you have successfully done that you can send the big money there
@_date: 2018-11-02 22:48:28
Duh. It's just a server side problem. Your coins are still there, chill.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:13:22
Just roll back the chain a block before the attack.

@_date: 2018-03-02 19:09:31
I mean which upgrade will be implemented first. We chose segwit. How? We will just hard fork and increase the blocksize when there is sufficient consensus.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:57:22

@_date: 2018-03-31 21:06:34
Bitcoins are mined with ASICs and not ordinary computers since 2012. You would need massive amount of hardware and electricity to solve every block first. It's not sustainable. Also the difficulty would increase rapidly. No one decides allocation. You just try different numbers (nonces) until you find one that works and then you broadcast your block to the network. After everyone else verifies your block is valid they start working on a new block, one that's "on top" of yours.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:54:10
Obviously roll back with a new algo duh
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:57:29
Exactly. That's why I thought you meant HD seed with the 2048 word wordlist
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:51:14
If Im understanding this correctly, a transaction with 30 inputs will be the same size as a transaction with only 1 input thanks to Schnorr, right? If this is the case then that's amazing. It will make transactions so much cheaper. And a block would be able to hold way way more transactions. All this with a soft fork.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:40:03
Actually it's a bitcoin address. Or maybe you are talking about an xpub?
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:24:45
Doesn't wasabi require a min of 0.1 btc for coinjoin?

@_date: 2018-11-01 09:52:27
Sure, but that adds a lot of complexity. If we want a truly private Bitcoin, everyone has to use wasabi or something similar. Bitcoin is different enough, making people use linux distros on their PCs would be too much imo
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:32:12
You shouldn't forget that this debate is not about which one of the two, but rather which one should come first. Bitcoin will have both segwit and bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:42:17
Bcash? No thanks.

@_date: 2018-11-26 15:04:41
What is Neutrino?
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:30:49
Well Bcash raised it. And you saw how that worked out. Bitcoin's price is $4200, Bcash's is $200. Bitcoin has the majority hash power, Bcash has a tiny percentage. Bitcoin is the most reliable and proven cryptocurrency in the world, and Bcash is vulnerable to 51% attacks and supported by Ver and Faketoshi, both of which are known for being bad actors, scammers, delusional and pathetic. 
.. So why should have we raised the blocksize again?
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:30:40
That's an off chain approach. Definitely possible. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:14:09
Well you are angering people by saying stuff like "bigger blocks will stop the LN" and "people won't allow bigger blocks" and so on. If you don't believe me then just look at your original comment. -4 upvotes. First of all 2 or 4 MB blocks won't kill nodes. Secondly, schnorr and other soft fork solutions will also increase the tx throughput like segwit did. People always say Bitcoin can't scale, until it does.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:06:37
I have no idea how I haven't seen this post, but I do know what a soft fork is. In my opinion BIP148 was what brought us segwit. Even if you disagree with that though, you can't call it a scam just because you don't like the idea. There was nothing scammy about it. It was very clear what its intentions were and what the outcomes could have been. No one lied or tricked users. It was their own choice to run or not to run BIP148 nodes. Definitely not a scam.
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:13:07

Ok, cool. I'll send you a PM. You would have to use Trezor wallet to verify the message since there is no defined standard for signing P2SH messages. And btw, claiming less than the maximum allowed coinbase reward is not a fork at all. You need to actually decrease the maximum allowed reward without breaking consensus to win this bet.

Bitcoin doesn't care about age. Samourai wallet is the best for android imo. Electrum for PC.
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:17:07
In my opinion it does add at least a little more security to it. Bitcoin is still secure even if your public key is known,like Kerckhoffs says. But if it isn't, it's slightly more secure. Even if we agree that it doesn't add any security, it still hurts privacy so addresses shouldn't be reused.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:05:07
Bitcoin is not for everyone just like the Internet was in the nineties. You don't seem to need Bitcoin, or at least not now, and that's ok. You're not forced to use it. It's just an alternative as I said. What I don't understand is, if really Bitcoin is pointless and scammy to you, then what are you doing in this sub?

Bcashers can't understand that Bitcoin is what people decide it is. Satoshi invented Bitcoin and that's great, but it doesn't mean he/she/they dictate Bitcoin's future. Satoshi talks about consensus. The Bitcoin community has reach consensus and agreed that we will have segwit. And that's Bitcoin. Bcashers weren't happy with that and forked off. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's an open competition. The best one wins. The problem is that bcashers want to steal Bitcoin's brand and name and call it shit like Bcore, Segwitcoin, lncoin etc. In fact, Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Bcash is a copy cat wanna be, centralized scammy altcoin.

r/btc are anti bitcoin. They all used to talk about "death spiral" "flipenning" and "being the real Bitcoin and taking the name ". They also supported segwit2x which was an attack against Bitcoin. If 2x succeeded, Bitcoin would have been dead. Because 2x had buggy code which caused the nodes to freeze and not accept new blocks. r/btc supports everything harmful for Bitcoin and rejects everything good for it. Once 2x was defeated they started to panic. Then the LN "vaporware" became real. And now segwit which was "anyone can spend" gained adoption. They are running out of FUD to spread. Bitcoin is working better than ever. Bcash lost. And they are pissed about it because they were scammed by Ver who is their almighty leader and also a felon. They sold their bitcoins for a centralised Chinese shitcoin that barely has 1/10th of Bitcoin's price.

Tell them this. There's no Bitcoin accounts. Bitcoin is not a company. Bitcoin is not owned by anyone. Bitcoin doesn't see borders, age, race, nationality and so on. Owning a bitcoin means knowing a number (a private key). It's just software. Just like anyone can have an e-mail, anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is not like PayPal. PayPal is a company and deals only with adults. Bitcoin is a piece of software and is absolutely permissionless.

That's exactly what I said. The case insensitivity  makes it look ugly. Why would someone need error correction when 99% of the time you either copy the address or scan it? Not worth it imo. Maybe in a year when it has gained more adoption. But for now it's not practical.

A private key is like a password. It's used to sign transactions and thus spend bitcoins. Only the owner of a private key can spend a specific coin. If anyone knows your private key(s), they can steal your bitcoins.  
A seed (12 or 24 random words, generated by your wallet or other similar tools) is used to generate all of your private keys.  
You just need to backup your seed. If you know your seed you can recover your bitcoins even if your device is destroyed or lost.

It has to do with both privacy and security. Since breaking the crypto algorithms is highly unlikely, we could say it has more to do with privacy.

The US banking system might be great but it's definitely not like this everywhere. Here the insurance is up to a certain amount of cash. If you have more and the bank goes bankrupt it's your own loss and no one will help you. But even if you have the greatest banking system out there, it's still not the same as it is with Bitcoin. A 5 year old can download a Bitcoin wallet and send btc to someone in Kenya. A 18 year old has to give out tons of personal info and what not and do loads of paperwork so they can have a bank account. And the bank knows every detail of that person's financial activity. It's really a horrible system imo. Hopefully the next generation will never have to deal with banks.

That's perfect 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:09:20
That's exactly what I mean. You dont have to pay 200 satoshi/byte for a priority transaction if all other non-priority ones are like 1 sat/byte. Double or triple at max.  Use 3 sat/byte and you will still get a confirmation in (about) 10 minutes 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:31:28
Of course I wouldn't make transactions while bip148 was active. No one would. The point was to activate segwit by making a longer chain and reorganizing the existing one. If not then ok. No one loses nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:29:13
UASF was Bitcoin. It didn't break consensus. It just wasnt the longest chain, but it could have been.  UASF succeeded. That's why we have segwit today.

Ross will be pardoned. If not by Trump, then by the next president who gets elected. We as a community have to help him because he helped us so much. The first to walk through the door gets shot.

Bitcoin is the beginning of something incredibly beautiful, important and needed. Bitcoin grants us financial freedom and provides an alternative to the horrible scammy, slow, expensive, abusive and privacy invasive banking system. Bitcoin is one of the most important human inventions and definitely the most important one after the Internet. Remember what the Internet did for information? Bitcoin is doing the same for money.

It's so cool to see all of that fun LN stuff. r/btc were bragging about their cool tipping bot. And now we have the lntip bot, cool stuff like instant near free transactions, interesting websites like SatoshiPlace, new users spinning up nodes and opening channels every day, Lightning Torches being passed around and so on while they have empty blocks and pointless forks every month.

@_date: 2019-01-07 12:01:22
I wonder if AsicBoost has something to do with that. Maybe Bitmain knows a shortcut and simply skips those nonce ranges to increase probability of finding a block. But then again, the gaps weren't completely empty, they still had some nonces which produced valid blocks. Who knows. The plot thickens.
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:48:39

@_date: 2019-01-19 20:26:48
That's not what I meant. We shouldn't present Bitcoin as a commodity or a "store of value". While the second is true, Bitcoin is also a currency. A currency meant to be spent and used. And it works. The on chain fees aren't even high. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 17:51:55
Not only Sofia. Those so called cashterminals are EVERYWHERE in every city. Tons of them. And the fee is just 1.2% plus 20 cents for a miner's fee. Great deal indeed. You see the btc in your wallet 40 seconds after you insert the bills. They have existed since 2014, if not earlier.

Every block creates new bitcoins. (Except for the ones mined after all 21M coins have been mined) The miner basically gives them to himself. The first transaction in each block is "no one sends the miner 12.5 btc for solving the block"  and then all of the other transactions. A block can contain only this transaction or many. The miner decides.

No consensus for a HF plus the security of the network would be decreased significantly. We have 20 PH/s. We would lose all of that if we changed PoW.

@_date: 2018-03-10 01:51:18
The conflict is that Bcash is trying to steal Bitcoin's brand. Litecoin is also a fork of btc but no one has any issues with it. Why? Because it's litecoin and not Blite.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:50:26
The maximum coinbase reward per block is a consensus rule. Changing that requres a hard fork because the new change wouldn't be compatible with the old rules. It breaks consensus. Educate yourself before insulting others, you non genius.

He was not a drug dealer. He created a website. The actual drug dealers who sold meth and crack on his website got 5 and 10 year sentences. And he gets double life + 40? Complete bullshit. The judge who sentenced him deserves to be in jail. Not Ross. Ross is a smart productive young man. There's no reason to waste taxpayer's money to keep him in a cage when he could be contributing so much to society. Do you think it's fair for rapists and murderers to get 20 years and then walk freely, while a smart kid creates a website and gets life without parole? America's justice system is a complete joke.

I don't get this. People who run nodes are most probably interested and involved in Bitcoin and its development.  Or at least they should care about their funds. Such people should have updated their nodes the moment they realized a critical bug was found. Average Joes don't run nodes. So how come node operators haven't updated after 3 months?
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:21:57
Cool. Maybe you could put a private key too and create a physical bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:45:15
Then we could change the PoW or increase the difficulty with a HF. It might lower the price significantly but Im pretty sure Bitcoin can survive a 51% attack. Can't say the same about Bcash though.

Bye, Bcash!
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:15:44
This is correct, but let me add something else too. This is not a debate "this or that" it's about which will come first. Bitcoin will have both segwit LN and so on as well as bigger blocks for on chain scaling. The community chose to implement segwit first because it doesn't require a hard fork and thus the currency doesn't split. And maybe now you are thinking "but some people wanted to do big blocks first so they forked off and that's how Bitcoin Cash(which I will call Bcash) was created". But Im not too sure. Segwit fixes a bug which allowed miners to cheat.(called ASICBoost) This exploit was patented by Bitmain. They didn't want to lose their advantage so they forked off to Bcash which has no segwit and claimed they want big blocks to scale Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:53:42

@_date: 2019-01-04 21:00:01
Maybe it's intentional. Bitpay used to show a warning message that the tx has a way too low fee and it confirmed in the next block.. they just like their shitcoin bcash better so they do everything possible to make btc look bad and expensive, when in fact they are the problem themselves. Oh well. Already getting replaced by BTCPay.

I learned about Bitcoin when the price was $360. I was 13 and I found a website that gave you satoshis for playing in their csgo server. I was wondering what a satoshi is. And boom. Bitcoin. Thanks csgo! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:42:50
A transaction is a movement of coins(if that's easier for you to understand). If you go and buy a coffee with bitcoin you have to make a transaction sending from your wallet to theirs.

Build the software and lets fork!

You still are. Because that's what I meant. The Genesis block was not mined. It was just put there out of thin air.

Why not just make them circles?
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:35:59
Bitmain has 15% hashpower and btc.com has 33. That means Jihan controls 48% of the hashpower. That's dangerously high even though 51% attacks are not really profitable, it promotes centralisation 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:11:25
How is this a crime? He is not selling anything. The "buyer" gives him the money and he sends him a bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin is not controlled by the government. Giving money away for free isn't a crime.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:06:37
That's amazing. More info on how we can make it too? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:46:24
I have. Checked it in the settings

Great video in my opinion. Maybe they should have pointed out that the single authority (bank) has the power to block/reverse your transactions while miners dont have power over you. They can just verify. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:04:00
Thanks for the explanation

Im wondering why don't they do it as one big ass transaction, pay 5 sat/byte and call it a day?

Hardware wallets are single purpose computers. They keep your private keys, sign your transactions and send your signed transactions to the computer and thus never revealing your private key. Even if the PC is full of viruses and malware you can still plug a hardware wallet and transact safely.

This 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:23:35
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:12:07
That's not true. Anybody could recover a private key by brute forcing it. Of course the possibility is stupidly low maybe it's more likely to win the lottery while being struck by a lightning but still there's a chance. So that's not impossible 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:38:29
Exactly. And it's a real good 1Gb/s.  You will constantly get 900-950 mb/s. Both download and upload. No monthly cap. Perfect for running full nodes.

@_date: 2018-02-21 21:18:59
Was his use right though? "I could careless"? Doesn't sound right to me so I thought he meant " I couldn't care less"
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:42:38
The longest chain with the greatest amount of PoW*
Bcash's chain is longer but they are operating at only 10% of our difficulty. That means that Bitcoin's PoW is still a lot more which means that's Bitcoin. And Bcash is not.

It's not even about making money. We all know how new, experimental and unpredictable Bitcoin is. When we saw the price surge from 4 to 17k he should have known that the same could happen in the opposite direction. His main mistake is that he invested more than he can afford to lose

Still too much. 10sat/byte is enough. Not more than a couple of cents
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:41:16
r/btc have always been anti bitcoin. They support every single attack on it. Unlimited(Bugs), then they were against BIP148, then they were all about Bcash and now they support 2x. Im wondering if they sleep in Bitmain's basement too.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:25:41
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:43:30
Yeah? What are you doing with them?
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:30:28
Any wallet which lets you control your private keys. Core, electrum, mycelium, breadwallet you name it. If you leave them at an exchange though  (coinbase,gemini,xapo whatever) then they decide for you.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:49:22
Could you connect samourai to your own node even if the phone is not connected to the same LAN? And also would that work if I left the wallet enabled? (In core)

They are based in Bulgaria.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:38:55
UASF pressured everyone to signal segwit2x so bip141 activated before August 1. If they didnt do it we would still have activated segwit thru bip148. Win win either way. After that we blocked 2x because it was the dumbest thing ever and now we have segwit without any badly coded hard forks. How much does Ver pay you? Im willing to shill too if he pays good.

Great website and great products. I have one thing to say though. On the FAQ section it says "do you accept Bitcoins?" That's incorrect. It should be lower b. bitcoins. The capital B is for the protocol and the lower one is for the currency denomination. Please fix. Other than that it's awesome :)

It already looks silly lmao.
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:03:21
No. It should be do you accept Bitcoin? Or do you accept bitcoins. The first one means do you accept payments through the Bitcoin protocol/network? The second one means do you accept bitcoins, those digital entries on the blockchain? Both work.

@_date: 2017-09-12 16:56:42
The whole fee yes. But the satoshi/byte ratio is the same. We had high fees because people were paying them. If nobody sets fees higher than 5sat/byte then that will become the super-overpriced priority fee and 1 sat/byte will be normal 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:17:24
You are stupid. I will remind you that once we hit 100k. Crypto ftw. Fuck banks.

@_date: 2017-09-17 18:16:40
I always do that. Copy then paste. Then verify like 100 times then send a 0 fee tx to verify I can see the coins in the new wallet. Cancel the 0 fee verify address again and then finally send the whole amount.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:25:47
How can I do that as well?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:12:55
Mining altcoins with your gpu and selling for Bitcoin.(download nicehash). Buying Bitcoin thru a bitcoin ATM(BTM) or buying locally without a middle man(Local Bitcoins).
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:22:29

I can't screenshot my TV. (Or can I?) And it's in Bulgarian either way. But it was just a message you see before you can do anything else. It said that from this date (today) you can set automatic payments and you can also pay using the "virtual currency" Bitcoin. They said they will add other cryptos as well.

@_date: 2018-02-27 09:40:35
Use samourai imstead of mycelium. Mycelium doesnt have segwit and their nodes are absolute shit. Also doesnt let you set really low fees like 1 sat/byte. Samourai has almost everything you will need. You can even connect it to your own full node
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:09:05
Oh, I do. And you can too.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:22:50
They can. They have the private key. The only thing they need to do is use it on the bcash network to create a transaction and give you your bch back
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:20:14
I would eat tons of veggies for Bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:34:58
Congrats! Add NO2X in the uacomment to show strong opposition of segwit2x.

Could be a faucet, a mining pool paying miners (but amounts seem too small) or even a bitcoin bank processing transactions for the users.

Satoshi invented the Blockchain to be used as a way to keep track of transactions that have ever happened. Bitcoin uses this technology, yes. Other alt coins use it too, but some also use different technologies like DAG or Tangle.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:08:02
I don't think we are going much higher than 5k before that November 2x shit gets sorted out.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:35:44
Segwit- a great thing. It increases the blocksize which will allow Bitcoin to process more transactions which results in lower fees. It also allows for future scaling by fixing an important bug-transaction malleability.
Segwit2x- an attack over the Bitcoin network. In November they will try to hijack Bitcoin. That's why we should oppose them. Run a core 0.15 node if you can.
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:25:45
Miners have absolutely no power. They can signal 2x support because WE allow them to do so. If nodes reject their blocks they can signal all day long. Nodes rule. Miners follow.
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:02:01
That's why the fees are low duh

They charge you fees while taking control over your money, setting limits for you and censoring your transactions. Not to mention they could freeze your account any time for any reason or bring you other sorts of headaches. They just have too much power and often abuse it.

 100 000 000 000 units.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:16:17
No :) because you need that software  (the virus) to run. And HW wallets have only the wallet firmware on board.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:27:14
This. Changing a variable is easy. SegWit and LN are smart solutions and dont split the currency and community 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:33:30
You go through the process multiple times. For every segwit account, you add a new wallet in electrum. For the first account the last number of the derivation path should be zero. For account  the last number should be one and so on. For every account you want to add you do the procces of selecting "hardware device" and you alter the derivation path.

Of course not. Everyone is free to run whatever version of the software they want. I trust Core so I run that. You can run ABC or btc0 or whatever. But in that case you will be breaking consensus and thus not participating in the network.

Why so serious?
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:30:29
There is. If you pay from one address  and then you receive money there again. Then your public key is known. If one day the eliptic curve or whatever is called gets cracked your bitcoins can be stolen. But if you never reuse addresses they will be still safe. That's pretty unlikely though.
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:52:52
These guys have never let me down :) they didn't support bch too.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:50:10
Because if you spin up 100 nodes thru AWS you don't achieve anything. But if you run your own node at home and lets say an electrum server on top of it you can verify everything all by yourself. You dont need to trust other nodes and their copy of the blockchain. You are truly your own bank. Yes 2x will survive even with 1 node but we can judge user support by the nodes. There are 200 2x nodes and 10k Core nodes. Which one do you think is more accepted? Yes 2x is the new UASF. We have to fight for our freedom and for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-01 18:32:36
That's all wrong. Every single node helps keep the network decentralised and in this case reject 2x nodes. (That applies if they are not all spun up on AWS or something.)

This is a segwit transaction. The fee is more than 0.6sat/byte. Blockchain.info is just broken. It would be very very difficult to propagate any transaction with less than 1.00sat/byte because most nodes reject them.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:45:25
True. But blame eth not Bitcoin.(I guess you meant ethereum
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:56:15
No. I was hoping to get freedom regarding my money and that's what I got. Bitcoin is not an investment for me. It's simply a better system/currency. I still made some profit due to buying early but even if it stayed the same it would still be worth it. And of course I bought only with money I was ready to lose in case something happens. Bitcoin is a very interesting new technology to me and I would rather sink with it than watch it grow from the side. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:58:15
? I think you misunderstood my post. I meant that fees are low as dirt and someone is paying 2000+ satoshi/byte when 1 s/b transactions are going through. This person paid 2000 times more than necessary.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:06:21
If people realize their transactions can be reversed/not processed in the event of a 51% attack everyone will sell everything which will make Bitcoin super worthless, it might even kill it. The attacker would be able to double spend coins but they will be worthless 
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:04:38
It is an attack. They leave people without an option. They force them to use their fork by not additional replay protection. I dont like Bcash but they added that protection and gained my respect. 2x is just miners pissing in the wind.

Breadwallet has already generated a new address for you. After each payment you receive a new address will be generated. Look at the receiving address in the transaction you got your bitcoins from. Then if you search that on blockchain.info you will see your balance

Your SPV wallet is connected to a full node. That full node broadcasts the transaction to all of the nodes it is connected to. And when they recieve it they broadcast it to all the nodes they are connected to and that happens again and again until the transaction is fully propagated. So you send it to the IPs of all the nodes your node has a connection to.

Try syncing with txindex=1 for extra waiting. It's worth it though. It gives you access to every transaction ever done on the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:02:56
An update of the Bitcoin network. Forks can be soft or hard. A soft fork is compatible with the old rules which means it can be implemented without the need of everyone to update their software. A hard fork is not compatible with the old rules. Everybody needs to upgrade. If there's a percentage that doesn't want to there's a split and now you have Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B. Imagine you wake up and you see there's a twitter update but you are too lazy to download it so you just go to tweet something. That's a soft fork. You can still use it regardless if you update or not. But lets say somebody hacked twitter and they release an important security update. You try to login but it says that you have to update the app before continuing. That's a hard fork. You can't continue using it unless you upgrade.

@_date: 2019-09-29 15:37:41
Bitcoin Core's code is definitely not perfect. Far from that. I remember seeing a post here about someone analyzing it and it was of pretty bad quality. Unnecessary brackets, pointless expressions and so on. Besides, the quality of code doesn't relate to the security of crypto algorithms. Once they are broken anything that uses them becomes insecure, no matter how perfect the implementation is. So many things use SHA256 and AES for example. If those are broken, Bitcoin will be your last problem.

A legacy input is 147 bytes, while a segwit input which uses a bech32 address counts as 68 bytes. So in practice a segwit transaction is smaller. Older software doesn't take the smaller input size into account and thus shows wrong feerates.
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:42:43

@_date: 2019-09-11 16:21:20
A seed can generate all possible Bitcoin addresses. There is something called gap limit, which is let's say 300. The wallet will derive address number 0. If there is btc there, it will derive address 1. If there is btc there too, continue to address 2. As soon as it finds an address with no btc (let's say  it will look for 300 more addresses just in case and it will stop. Then it will add up your balance from all UTXOs.

Not many are able to do it. As I said you can't be sure if nopara is immoral either. Theoretically any dev can screw you. I advocate Samourai because they are the best wallet at the moment. Not only privacy wise. They have everything you would want. Segwit, bech32, batch spending, coin control, custom fees, message signing. They even have cool stuff like paynyms and cahoots. And finally and most importantly they released Dojo which allows me to completely bypass their servers and use my own node instead. Don't trust, verify.

You overpaid the fee. Next time you can send with just 1 satoshi/byte. No need to feed Jihan's mouth. Use a website like confirmtx.com when you send a transaction. It will go through in 24 hours. And dont panic. bitcoins dont just vanish. It will either confirm and get to its destination or it wont and you will be able to spend it again.

@_date: 2019-09-29 21:53:41
Ok you have a point. Everyone agreed on segwit though. It was just the miners which were blocking it. I guess the more controversial the change is, the harder it is to get it implemented
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:23:51
Definitely do not use blockchain wallet. Very unreliable. Try a mobile wallet. Samourai or Mycelium for Android and HODL wallet for ios. Completely open source and free of charge.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:16:51
It enables you to use Bitcoin autonomously, just like it was intended to be. Every mobile wallet uses a node to communicate with the Bitcoin network 
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:56:23
There is no easy way to connect a mobile wallet to a full node. Same goes for a hardware wallet (this is being worked on). You should be able to just type your node's IP and port and use Bitcoin completely independently. Instead I had to install a linux VM, configure a bunch of files and setup Dojo which sucks 2 additional gigs of RAM on top of Bitcoin Core. Not to mention it doesn't always work as expected. We need to work on the link between mobile wallets and full nodes.

Negatives: It's difficult to use at this stage, one typo and you could send 10 times more than you wished to send, unpredictable conditions: today the fees might be at their lowest, tomorrow they could skyrocket, bad parties make Bitcoin almost impossible to use (looking at you BitPay), it's resource and time consuming to use Bitcoin the way it's intended to be used, privacy is weak, it takes a lot of knowledge and some money to improve it.
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:51:12
If I open a channel to you with 500 000 sats you will be able to receive 500 000 sats. Whoever you opened a channel with can receive as many sats as you committed. That's the best way to get inbound capacity. The other way is to send some sats first.

It doesnt transfer. It stays in the old address. A wallet is not a single address. It's multiple addresses. If you recieve 10 payments all to a new fresh address and you want to spend them all your transaction will have 10 inputs( you will be sending 10 different addresses' balances)

I also thought so. But do you know how stressful it is to move them when you want to sell a fork's coins for example? You have to check the address a million times or you might lose everything.

I think you spelled it wrong. What a name though!
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:28:31
It's actually around 1.1-1.2 sats/byte, but still pretty cheap! Most explorers calculate feerates wrong because of segwit. You can't send a transaction with less than 1 sat/byte in practice.
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:38:45
It's horrible. I hate going to the bank more than everything. Hopefully I won't have to use it much in the future. Go Bitcoin!

The first transaction in the block is 12.5 (or more if there are any fees) bitcoins from nowhere to the miner's address. The miner literally pays himself. When he finds the block and the network accepts it everyone has +12.5 btc to the miner's address in the blockchain. That's how  miners get rewarded.

You will pay 9050 in case you need to force close the channel. If you close the channel cooperatively, you will pay a much lower fee. In order to receive you need spend some sats or have someone open a channel to you. Here's what you can do. Google "zigzag exchange". Send half of your lightning balance there and you will get it on-chain. Then you will be able to receive as many sats as you have sent there.

If I send you 10 btc and you want to send 9 of it to someone else it will be very very cheap, especially if you use segwit ( which you absolutely should ).  
If I sent you 1 btc every day for 10 days in a row though, and you wish to send 9 of it, the fee would be ~10times bigger.   
I said 10, but the amount can be 0.00001 or 100000 btc. The fee doesn't change. The only thing that matters is the size of the transaction in bytes.

I believe no one should change Bitcoin  (hard forks) without a replay protection. If tomorrow Core decides to set the minimal relay fee to 10BTC and Hard forks do you think people will support that? Of course not. But they should add replay protection if someone wants to pay 10BTC and use that fork.

An update of the Bitcoin network. Forks can be soft or hard. A soft fork is compatible with the old rules which means it can be implemented without the need of everyone to update their software. A hard fork is not compatible with the old rules. Everybody needs to upgrade. If there's a percentage that doesn't want to there's a split and now you have Bitcoin A and Bitcoin B. Imagine you wake up and you see there's a twitter update but you are too lazy to download it so you just go to tweet something. That's a soft fork. You can still use it regardless if you update or not. But lets say somebody hacked twitter and they release an important security update. You try to login but it says that you have to update the app before continuing. That's a hard fork. You can't continue using it unless you upgrade.

For one, Wasabi requires a minimum of 0.1 btc which is too much for some people. Samourai has a 0.01 btc pool. 
Another thing I dislike about Wasabi is that it is desktop only. I prefer mobile wallets. They are also more secure if we are talking about windows on desktop.
Samourai also has cool post mix tools like Stowaway. 
Finally, you can free ride on Whirlpool which means you can get as many anonimity sets as you want for the same price. It's just cheaper. Those are the reasons why I prefer Whirlpool.

Because no one uses Bcash duh. Your blocks are ~100 kb. If Bitcoin's blocks were not full fees would be almost 0 (they still are now) and transactions would be included in the very next block. Bch is not advanced in any way. You are not the only one who can increase the blocksize limit you know? If Bitcoin goes to say 32.1 MB and we have segwit and LN.. then who is more advanced? All Im saying is, BCH has done nothing revolutionary. Bitcoin could do that too. Many other coins have also done it. So why no "flippening"? Because it sucks.

You shouldn't be trusting the developers anyway. If you are that paranoid about your security/privacy just audit the source code. You can disable auto updates.

Some merchants have been accepting Bitcoin payments since 2013. Many people use it to store wealth since they don't trust the banks. (A while ago a big bank bankrupted and many people lost money) Also our gov is pretty corrupt so Bitcoin allows us to kinda escape from it. Overall it's pretty great that Bitcoin exists.

Hey, I agree with you but I have a question. Realistically, how could someone double spend a 0-conf tx? First off, singing the transaction is pretty hard without exposing your private keys. Wallets wont let you send the same coins twice. Even if you manage to sign a double spending transaction, propagating it doesn't seem to work well either. I tried it once. All broadcasting services give a "mempool conflict error". My own node did that too. I restated it and the mempool cleared. I was able to broadcast the double spending transaction but most nodes rejected it and it wasnt visible on any block explorers. So overall I dont see how anyone could abuse 0-conf. If a merchant is expecting a larger sum like $100 they can wait for a confirmation, but microtransactions could be accepted with 0-conf (if sufficient fee is added)

Im 1000% sure I havent sent anything. So yeah it's b)
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:51:59
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:01:34
To spend the rest.

@_date: 2018-04-15 11:09:53
I think the odds are pretty low. The chance of winning for 2x reward should be 50/50 aka 2 options. And we have 16.  
Edit: Im dumb. I didnt see you could choose 7 digits.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:03:01
I guess you are right. It should have been implemented right away. But miners abused their power.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:52:48
How much do you get paid?
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:36:07
The sending address is the same as the receiving one. It's not a change address
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:17:20
This is quality content!
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:49:22
Yes and yes. Well to any segwit address that starts with a "3".  
There are segwit addresses that start with "bc1". They are not fully adopted yet so Id recommend getting one that starts with a 3. Use samourai wallet or buy a trezor.
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:10:41
How is that ignorant? For the thousandth time. I used my **phone** to generate the seed not my computer.
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:02:43
I have just one question. Why cant we send LN transactions from phone to phone? That would be great! 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:07:55
You can check the transaction for yourself.
0.91 mBTC or 7 bucks.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:23:15
Really glad someone pointed that out.
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:20:33
Should I sell?
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:07:43
Did you even read my post? The iancoleman part is almost irrelevant. I used it now to spend the coins. They were stolen on 08/05/17. I haven't said it's the generator website's fault duh.
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:01:04
That's the point. We don't trust him/her. We can verify it.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:46:08
Bitcoin doesn't use GPUs for mining since 2012. How are we fucking it over? Besides, this is the future. Bitcoin is way more important than gaming. You will realise in ~10 years.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:04:18
Im running one ;) I can't seem to create an invoice for less than one sat though.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:16:24
Any arguments? Or it's gonna happen just because you say so 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:36:24
You cant relay a transaction with less than 1.00 sat/byte. Blockchain.info calculates segwit fees wrong
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:10:14
He said less than 0.1% but they wrote 10% in the subs. Great video!
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:35:08
That's great!
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:54:10
Invest in Pikacoin! It supports the Lightning Network!
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:44:41
The poor gamer hoping for the best lol. Bitcoin isn't mined with GPUs since 2012. Altcoins use GPUs.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:48:53
Dont use web wallets. And dont store your bitcoin on online exchanges. Download samourai for android or buy a trezor if you have a significant amount of money.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:46:34
It only needs coin control and it would be perfect. And LN support eventually.
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:23:46
Bitcoin also works. Pretty well actually 
@_date: 2018-04-30 12:59:49
Probably. You should find a trustworthy seller.
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:00:00
Poor ver.. being abused in such a horrible way. Crybaby.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:17:43
I did and it was my own.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:58:06
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:39:50
They are literally sending money to themselves. Did you even see the transaction?
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:01:18
Satoshi power.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:50:29
You are pretty dumb.
1) Bitcoin isn't mined with GPUs since 2012  
2) Bitcoin is more important than gaming. That's bigger than the Internet itself bro. Do you even realise that?
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:33:23
Maybe. But I dont see how they could have gotten my address. Oh well. Time to buy some monero I guess xD
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:44:40

@_date: 2018-04-17 06:24:46
I love how the last rider is Bcash!
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:01:36
It's fairly subjective. A successful hard fork for me is having only 1 chain after the upgrade. Let's say &gt;95% of users,miners, nodes, hashrate, exchanges etc.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:53:28
Това къде е? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:49:37
Jesus Christ. Bcash is becoming even more pathetic 
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:56:14
Why the hell is tax not included in the price?
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:22:30
Sure.

What's the 13th digit of the TXID of your 4th transaction with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:04:24
Of course I did it offline. But besides, this seed wont be used again so who cares.
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:48:26
Wait for one confirmation and you are good. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible unlike PayPal, bank transfers and other centralised payment systems
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:58:48
In Bulgaria you dont need any verification for buying/selling crypto worth up to 30 000BGN (~ $19 000)
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:12:59
Good job! I won't have to switch my favourite wallet. I think with 2 months left we have a  REALY big chance to make history. UASF, let's go!

As a Christian I know god said that he is the only one and no one should ever believe in other 'gods'. So I believe god appeard in a satoshi's dream and gave him the idea to create bitcoin. Thank you, Jesus. May the blockchain be with you! Amen.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:48:21
And bitcoin is a ponzi pyramid.
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:04:54
I like the idea a lot. How many people have played it?
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:50:06
Samourai wallet for Android or Electrum for Windows. Make sure you write down your seed and keep it safe
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:14:20
PoW means nothing if nobody uses the chain. Users are the law and not the miners.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:56:36
Малко е далеч, но е възможно! Имаш ли уеб сайт или нещо? И също надявам се, че ползваш SegWit адреси!

The best place to buy gift cards with Bitcoin. You will not be disappointed
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:57:54
1. With breadwallet.  
2.  It's not fucking stupid. Iancoleman can be used to generate seeds but also to derive addresses and private keys from seeds. I used that to create and sign a raw tx. Yeah a keylogger is probably the case. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:31:22
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:18:55
There are many exchanges who dont require 18+. Also BTMs. In person trading. Lots of options 
@_date: 2018-04-18 09:05:32
I'm considering OP's post is true. And my advice would help only if it's really true. There's no point in lying really
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:09:54
Just wait till they update it!
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:00:26
You should ask Craig Left. He is the Bitcoin CEO( Satoshi Nakamoto). He can tell you if your coins are real or not. /s
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:16:47
Bcash supporters are probably at r/suicidewatch now.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:15:23
So true

Blockstream has nothing to do with btc. Anyway. How much are you willing to bet?

Gotcha. Just thought there's something like a signature and I don't see it on mobile.

Well of course you only have 8, you haven't forwarded your ports.

This is Bulgarian, bro. Bitcoin is pretty famous here. For such a little and poor country that is.

Yeah but if I go to the store and something costs 2 bucks I know it costs that much and I can see if I can afford it. If I go to a US store I have to do math to calculate the final price after tax. It's just more difficult.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:01:51
I have tested it. As you see it thru the picture, you cant scan it. But in person it works like a charm
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:50:39
Where did you get the address from? Could you sign a message with the bech32 address? (Idk if that's possible)
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:57:35
Litecoin has been "more advanced product" than btc for quite a while with its bigger blocks. Eth too, dash, monero etc etc. Why is Bcash different? Because it has B in it. No one would have cared if it was called "CashCoin" for example. It's just the brand. If people wanted bigger blocks they would have switched to something else years ago.
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:26:26
That's 200 000 satoshis!
@_date: 2017-05-16 10:28:25
Soo. We will have segwit in 2 months? If that's true then awesome!!
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:29:07
As long as you signal segwit.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:57:08

Go back to your cave, Jihan.

For satoshi's sake bulgarians firts adopted the Cyrillic alphabet and then the russians. So if you're not gonna say "Cyrillic" you should say bulgarian.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:04:29
The fee is absolutely enormous. Right now 1sat/byte is going through. 6 mBTC is way too much
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:53:42
When the majority of transactions are off chain there will be more than enough space in the blocks for your transaction to go through IMO
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:52:39
True. There's mail for that
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:07:11
Andreas is really awesome. Too bad his videos dont usually appear in the recommendations so more ppl can join the revolution.

@_date: 2017-05-17 21:28:36
Of course, I know. I am actually selling my hashing power and getting paid in btc. Yeah, it's not really mining but $2.60 a day is really good for a 15yo broke teen. I think everyone knows that mining btc w/o many many asics and cheap power is absolute.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:18:17
For the love of god activate segwit. If this happens I will start doing my homework. I swear.
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:53:44

The advantage is that no one can block your transaction, freeze your account or make you explain why and where you are sending the money. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:00:34
Nicehash is not a scam nor a cloud mining service. I have reviewed 7 payouts w/o any problems. They are like the glue between individuals who want to cloud mine and users who offer their hashpower for mining.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:08:55
So now $2 a mbtc?
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:31:35
I do. You do. Everyone does.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:26:07
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:35:40
Cool I have one raspberry but the guy misspelled it (pie) and also the water thing is bullshit. That will short the pcb and kill your pi. Also im pretty sure you could download the mining software. The hdmi is dumb you dont need video output just set it to mine and leave it. Ill try it now and will report the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:04:27
Bad choice of words. The price will be witnessed when it goes to the moon!

@_date: 2018-04-09 15:10:25
Bcash is dumb. At one point the delay between 2 blocks was like 12 hours. What's the point in increasing the blocksize when confirmations are still slow? That's a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-22 00:48:11
Because Bitcoin is going up.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:07:19
I buy mine at crypto.bg the limit is 20 000BGN so about 12 000USD
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:49:35
Well I predict they will drop and be ~10c for a transaction. Maybe 20 for priority 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:14:37

Can't upvote this enough

nicehash. And actually its about 3.765 hashes/s. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:59:05
Do you realise that if we had segwit and ln already we might be at 10k now?
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:22:53
Litecoin is like bitcoin's brother. They have segwit and operate with 2.5 minutes block time. Maybe there is a reason why satoshi chose 10mins but I dont know.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:08:54
Yes, but what do you think is gonna happen to eth when they reach BTC level? It's the same story.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:53:35
Hate to be that guy, but.... too*
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:21:57

I can sense your fear, Jihad 
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:21:13
I really really hope so.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:17:46
They are using their asicboost cuz soon they wouldn't be able to do so. Segwit to the rescue 
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:44:03
Dash is trash

@_date: 2017-07-25 11:11:51
I like you
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:55:12
The same goes for bitcoin. It really is effortless and anxiety free. What do you have to worry about? I mean if there's a HF or something like that (aug 1) yeah but 99.9999% of the time you just send and boom.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:41:22
You could have bought 6x RX 480s for ~ $20/day. Much easier to re sell cuz they can be used for gaming while the asics are worthless after a while
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:52:48
With electrum you cango down to 30sat/byte. Still better than mycelium. They were my favourite until the fees went to the moon
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:23:07
Correct 
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:35:16
You are lying. There will never be 21M BTC in the world. Its just how toshi created it.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:10:02
But still encrypted 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:18:19
Finally someone who gets it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:27:39
Im really happy we have crypto.bg at my country. No IDs no passports no shit. Everyone can buy btc there. Just go to a shopping mall, famous grocery store or even a pizzeria, put some cash in the big red machine and the btcs will be sent to your address. Seems really difficult to buy btc outside of Europe if you are under 18
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:34:50
Im not being ignorant. The exact opposite. Im trying to understand what could have happened so it doesnt happen again

I meant it's not a good practice.

Segwit gives you a "discount". You pay around 30% less fees. And your transactions take up less space which ultimately allows more transactions to be included in each block. The more people use segwit the cheaper it becomes for everyone.

I think he meant how are we sure all transactions in this block are valid. Nodes who keep the whole blockchain and update it when a miner finds a block very that these transactions are indeed valid

BIP148 is the backup option if miners decided not to activate segwit thru bip91. BIP148 creates a chain split though while if bip91 is activated then it will be implemented on this chain.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:08:11
Yes, there is no protocol for the order of the transactions. Every miner (pool) decides for himself which transactions to include and yes if someone finds a block and broadcasts it all other miners have to abandon their previous work and start working on a new block .

Replace by fee. It's an option good wallets have which allows you to send a transaction with a low fee and later increase the fee if you want to. You shouldn't use this option when buying stuff from merchants though. They don't accept rbf immediately and you'll have to wait for a confirmation. Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Samourai wallet. Those support RBF. Other wallets do too, but Im not sure which exactly.

Why would you make the survey 18+ ? One of the reasons I started with bitcoin is because I believe everyone should have access to banking and control its own money. You cant have a bank account if you are under 18, no problem. There aren't any restrictions with bitcoin. Why wouldn't you hear what minors have to say? After all we are the ones from the new generation and we will probably adopt new technology before you.

The difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks). The more miners the more difficult it gets. The target difficulty is so only one block can be found every 10 minutes on average.

That's not really Samourai's fault. They can't change Core's code to make it encrypted. They're working on their new dojo thing which will completely bypass their servers and securely connect to a trusted node. Yeah maybe trusted node is not best now but Samourai has some pretty advanced features which other wallets don't have.

Does that mean schnorr is coming too? And probably activation is far away. Even when activated, we have to wait for wallets and services to implement it, right? Seems like it won't be here in the next year

@_date: 2019-05-02 12:50:30
Well I've been doing it for over a year now and nothing has happened. Of course that doesn't mean everyone should do it but it's not that bad if you use disablewallet=1

There's no guarantee he would pay if I had won too. It's an internet anonymous bet. He could just delete his account or be a little more decent and apologize publicly like I did. There's nothing creepy about that. That's the most I can do and I did it. It's easy to just sit and judge people. Try to imagine being in my shoes. Yeah I made a mistake. Im sorry.

The UASF was how we got segwit. It's marked as Bitcoin Independence day. A memorable event in the history of Bitcoin. Everyone who ran a UASF node deserves credit for helping us activate SegWit.

@_date: 2018-12-31 17:51:04
It doesn't use SegWit. That alone should be a deal breaker for any Bitcoiner. It lacks many features and is run by people who oppose Bitcoin in general. There have been many horror stories about lost funds involving blockchain.info's wallet. There's no reason to use it. Use Samourai Wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:49:56
Never again!
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:42:35
I just explained to you why it wouldn't. And by the way, Bitcoin doesn't use encryption. The process of creating addresses out of public keys out of private keys is not encryption.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:09:55
That is not entirely true. It would not get rejected by any node. My node accepts 0 fee transactions. But since Im not a mining node the transaction would probably never be mined (confirmed)
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:19:14
Even if someone stole your hardware wallet, they wouldn't be able to do anything with it. They need your PIN and have very few tries to get it before the device wipes itself.

Is there a way to run a LN node, but fund it from other sources (not Bitcoin Core)?
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:26:52
Yep I agree with that. Do you have an idea why the rpc isn't encrypted itself though?

Eat a snickers. Both of you.

Capital B (Bitcoin) refers to the protocol and the technology as a whole. Lowercase b (bitcoin) refers to the currency token. For example:  
"I like how easy Bitcoin payments are" and   
"I paid 2.5 bitcoins for my rent".
There are some disagreements between people. Some say the plural of bitcoin (token) is bitcoin as well. I use" bitcoins" though. Like we say 10 dollars and not 10 dollar it should be 10 bitcoins and not 10 bitcoin. But use whichever you like better.

@_date: 2018-12-08 18:50:37
You are right. It can be done, under certain conditions. The whole time I was thinking that it has to be done no matter what(100% success rate). So yeah if there's no majority the new upgrade could fail. If there is however, it would work and the block reward would be decreased through a soft fork like the guy said. It might not necessarily work but it **CAN** happen. That's what he meant. Moral of the story: read the description.  
So yes, I was wrong. I admit that. However, I can't afford to pay for my loss and yes, that is shameful. I am sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:30:25

@_date: 2017-07-30 13:59:58
Do you mean to confirm it? If yes then a person would need to find a block. A GPU can check about 330 million hashes every second. And thats super super super super slow. A human can do 0.67 per day. So the answer  (keeping in mind the rising difficulty) is never
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:17:54
Wow that's pretty serious. What is invalidateblock used for actually? Why would someone manually do it if the node validates them automatically?
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:19:52
Well they do say that trusted node should only be used in the local network at home without a vpn. Also I used disablewallet=1 so no btc at risk. However I learned that I could be tricked to follow a different chain(!!!) Which is also pretty serious.
@_date: 2018-12-24 19:08:21
How did we get from discussing cryptography to egos? What I said was true. I wasn't wrong. There can be multiple reason why we do things. One of them is as I said for security and the other is as someone else said for practicality (shorter addresses). There might be more reasons which I don't know about. Which of those is the primary reason is subjective. For me security is more important so for me the primary reason why we hash keys is to make it more secure.  
You don't seem to care about the technology much. You just like starting fights and being douchy. Have a nice Christmas eve man.

If you see my post history, you will see that I was supporting UASF. Strongly, in fact. I proved you that you lost the bet. You owe me 1 BTC which of course you refuse to pay. That was expected. There's nothing dishonorable here. I don't insist on hard forks. I insist on consensus. Hard forks are not bad as long as they are not contentious. Bcash is a contentious hard fork. You are pretty toxic too.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:25:59
It's not true that bigger blocks hurt Bitcoin. SegWit increased the blcoksize and it really helped Bitcoin. I've been banned from r/btc for ages. Bcash is a shitcoin, but I didn't create it and the people who did are definitely not my friends. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 12:32:37
Well I don't see it in your post but Im glad we agree.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:03:40
How are mempools kept in sync? How am I sure that my transaction is in at least 50% of them and not just in the node where I broadcasted it?

I don't think he would but yeah, of course.

This might affect Bcash since they are a month ahead. When their coin halves but Bitcoin is still at 12.5 per block it would be much more profitable to mine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:48:20
The UASF. I remember those exciting and also kinda scary times. It was really history in the making. Then about a month later I witnessed the activation of SegWit. The first SegWit block had an interesting transaction with a vanity address. Good times.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:11:19
You can in fact make a new consensus rule that limits the block reward to 0.25 or whatever coins. This rule however is a soft fork as you said which means it is opt-in. No one is forced to follow it. That means that newly upgraded nodes who follow the rule will reject blocks with a bigger reward than 0.25 btc. BUT since the new rule is not enforced on every single node, legacy nodes would still accept a block with a reward of 12.5 btc for example. The bet had 2 conditions. 1) A miner must not be able to claim more than 0.25 btc and 2) the change must be a soft fork. Since you satisfy condition 2) and the change is a soft fork, the change is not enforced. It's only opt in. That means, any miner could still mine 12.5 coins since the legacy consensus rule still exists. That doesn't satisfy condition 1). A miner would in fact be able to claim more than 0.25 btc. If we want to satisfy condition 1) and make it so that no miner can claim more than 0.25 coins, we must enforce the new rule on every node. And that would be a hard fork. The conclusion: only one of the set conditions can be satisfied at a time. If we satisfy condition 1), condition 2) is invalid. If we satisfy 2), then 1) is invalid. Therefore you lose the best because it's not possible to introduce a new rule via a soft fork that prohibits miners to claim more than 0.25 coins per block. Any miner who doesn't opt in for the new soft fork can still claim 12.5 coins.
@_date: 2018-12-26 17:37:10
Any passphrase is valid. So your 12 words + any passphrase will give you a different Bitcoin wallet. That's why it says it's successful. It's not like passwords where it says invalid and doesn't let you in. Sorry for your loss, man. Remember that money isn't everything. At least you have some experience now and you'll know not to repeat the same mistake again. You'll earn your money back. Don't stress too much about it and enjoy the holidays

It is the former. And I totally realize how wrong it was to participate in such a bet. To be honest I thought he would chicken out or that he wasn't being serious about the whole thing. You know, just like people on the internet lie all the time. But then things got serious and I didn't want to seem like a pussy for chickening out. So I went on. I expected to win (because I was too sure I was right) and him not to pay because it's a stupid internet bet. Well, it turns out I lost. I really wasn't and Im not ready to lose that much money though. I learned that I have to be honest. I'll make sure to never repeat this mistake in my life, but I simply can't honour the bet.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:42:47
I would say buy btc if you plan to use it and spend it. If you just want to make money (hodl) you shouldn't do it in my opinion. You could lose your money and 200€ is a lot for a teen. And I don't mean Bitcoin could crash. You could lose the btc if you're not careful. Buy 30€ worth, play with it, learn about the technology and how to be your own bank. Then you will be able to decide if you want to hold your savings in Bitcoin. Whatever you do, remember! With Bitcoin you're on your own in the wild. With great power comes great responsibility. Good luck!

Dude stop pretending you're so perfect. No one is perfect. We have all made mistakes in our lives. You just haven't made any in your reddit life. I understand why you're upset and your reasons are totally valid, but you can't pretend you're the best and the greatest and that you will remove all liars and cheaters etc from the ecosystem. There are scammers in r/Bitcoin, there are haters and trolls too, it's possible that criminals or sick monsters lurk there too, but we'll never know. Yeah I lied and it sucked but people change. Try to give them a second chance, because when you fucked up (and yeah you have at some point in your life) someone gave you a second chance and helped you become better. You've been here for 3 months and you act like you created this sub, this community and this ecosystem. No one likes to deal with liars and after this incident we'll have to deal with one less. Because I realized what I did and I changed. But you don't seem to change. You keep insulting me and the people who forgave me. I did something bad, but what you're doing is not good either. You're not going to make this ecosystem a better place with your negativity. There might not be a way to get rid of all liars and cheaters in this community, but if that's what you really want you should accept those who change for the better.

Not only on January 3. People should keep their Bitcoin in their own wallets where they have full control of their private keys, unless they are actively trading on the exchange.

I don't think my "signing of" is comical in any way. Those were the mistakes I made and I urge others not to repeat them. What you're saying is true.. but it's just too much money. It's not about being greedy. I just can't possibly pay that up. Since I can't do that, the best I can do to de clown myself as you call it is to make that post, apologize and learn from my mistakes. If I was rich or at least wealthy enough I would give him a bitcoin. Hell he can take 5. Let him be happy, he deserves it. He won the bet. But at this time that's the most I can do.

Of course it can be reversed. Just wait until the bank is the one suffering from a certain transaction (a security breach, hacker, etc) and the tx will be immediately reversed. They just don't care about users. 
When we mention chargebacks and Bitcoin though  I think most of the time people mean debit/credit card transactions. I've heard they're final after 6 months. In Bitcoin you have to wait for 6 confirmations at most. In the banking world.. you can always get your money taken away, because it's not really yours.

You can look at my original replies to his comments. The bet had 2 conditions.
1) the change must be a soft fork (aka it doesn't break consensus)  
2) no miner must be able to claim more than 0.25 btc.
If the change is a soft fork, any legacy node could still mine 12.5 coins because the old rules are still present. That invalidates condition 2)  
If the the change is a hard fork.. well that invalidates condition 1). Only one of the two conditions can be met at a time which means he lost the bet.

We are in active signalling, but it was supposed to start july 21. Some miners started signalling early though 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:48:01
I think a while ago exchanges used to track deposits not by the address itself, but the transaction ID. People exploited this. They sent X coins to the exchange, then changed the TXID and tricked the exchange into thinking they sent 2 separate transactions. They effectively double spent their coins. I'm not really sure about this exploit though. I know it has to do with exchanges, But it's probably not executed the way I described it above.

I disagree. We don't run nodes to earn Bitcoin, but to participate in the network. To be independent and to have full control of our finances. It's true, a node does help the network a little, but no one would care if your or my node went down for a week. People run nodes for their own sake.

Well prove it. I can also just say things. Every single sentence in my previous comment was true. See?  
I don't get what your problem with UASF is, but it was something important for Bitcoin and if you call it a scam and a lie then you probably don't understand it too well. When UASF was proposed, it was recommended to be run by almost everyone in this sub. Why? Because miners have been abusing their powers and it was time to stop them.
 Everyone knew what BIP148 was. Its creators didn't try to trick us into running a software that does something malicious. Everyone knew the possible consequences of running a UASF node and no one was forced to run one. If you don't support UASF then cool. Everyone has their own opinion. However, you can't call it a scam just because you don't like it. 
Bcash is a scam. Roger Ver is a scammer, Faketoshi is a scammer. They all lie and trick people into thinking things that aren't in fact true. UASF was proposed and it was totally transparent. Every single node operator could choose if they wanted to run it or not. No one lied to them about UASF. (Well besides r/btc users)   
BIP148/UASF was not a scam.

Invalid, according to the new rule. But the old rules are still present and they allow blocks with a reward of 12.5 btc. Now if we had a hard fork, it would change the old rule so that no blocks with a reward greater than 0.25 are valid. But it's not hard, it's soft. It adds a new rule, but doesn't remove the legacy rules. You are the one who doesn't understand. Just make a comparison with segwit. Segwit is a soft fork. New, segwit transactions are of course valid. But that doesn't make the old legacy transactions invalid. Your new rule caps the block reward at 0.25 but that doesn't make blocks with 12.5 btc reward invalid. You are the one who's trying to twist things and delaying the payment.

You better ask what is not corrupt. These guys will do anything for money. Not only the cops but everyone who has power. The laws can be easily bypassed if you have someone inside. Just a few examples.
2 years ago, my cousin was waiting for her bus on the bus stop near the school. A dumbass from Greece with a rented sports car was having a race or something, crossed a red traffic light with 100+ km/h and then failed to stop hitting my cousin and breaking both her legs. To this day she hasn't fully recovered and still needs one more surgery. Please note that all this was on camera and there were plenty of witnesses. After a long trial, the fucker got away only with a 10k fine. He was driving drunk, with very high speed, he didnt even have a driver's license and almost killed a person and didn't even spend a night in jail. This would have never happened in the States. He had money, he paid to whoever is needed and saved his ass.
Last summer a big Storage Warehouse got on fire. It all burned down and everyone wanted to know how it happened. Well, a rich guy (a politician, not the president but still high) paid someone to burn it, so he could use the land to build a house or something. Again, lots of evidence, but they made up a story that a homeless man lit up some wood to heat himself and that started the fire. Yeah, heat himself in 30+ degrees(Celsius btw) in the freaking summer. The poor guy is probably now behind bars while the sucker is living in a new house. 
The are probably many more stories and this will never stop. I love my country and my home city but the government is ruining it all. One day I will move out because this is just ridiculous.

Just the fact that they haven't implemented segwit 18 months after its activation makes them anti-Bitcoin to me.

The problem is not the bigger blocks themselves but the hard fork which is needed in order to increase the blocksize. Hard forks are incredibly hard and dangerous to execute.

Then we could also throw some bigger blocks in there.

99% of the time, such a transaction will not propagate across the network because it doesn't include a sufficient fee for relay. Anyone who runs a node however can adjust this setting and make the minimum fee for relay 0 satoshis. So most probably (99% of the time) no nodes would be aware of your transaction and it would be as if you never sent it. In case your transaction reaches a mining node it could eventually be mined when blocks are not full.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:14:02
Pretty much non existent. If you plan on using RPC make sure to use a very strong password. And it's recommended that you access RPC only in your home network. If you plan to expose RPC outside of your local network (that's different from opening the ports) then you shouldn't use your node as a wallet. If you just open your ports you will be completely safe.

Why should I hide in a hole and constantly look over my shoulder in fear of being recognized? Why should I try to trick people into thinking Im a completely different person? That's lying.

Ok, I'd like to know why Im wrong so try to explain it to me if you can. There's a soft fork, which makes all blocks with a reward bigger than 0.25 btc invalid. However, there's still a consensus rule, that exists, that allows blocks with up to 12.5 btc reward to be added to the blockchain. If a miner doesn't upgrade to the new rules and mines a block with a reward of 12.5 btc, all other legacy nodes would accept it. The upgraded nodes however would reject the block. That means the new rules could break consensus and cause a chain split (a hard fork). So how is it possible to decrease the block reward with a soft fork if it breaks consensus and causes a split? A soft fork is supposed to be backwards compatible, like segwit. In this example however I don't see how the 2 different node types could be compatible and reach consensus. Thanks for taking the time to explain

Because when you give someone your address they can send you coins, but they don't know your public key. It's like a second layer of protection. If the cryptography that makes public keys out of private keys is one day reversed, your coins would still be safe because your public key is not known. Once you spend from an address, you reveal your public key. And even though its name is "public" it's better if it's kept a secret. That's why address reuse is discouraged.

They are using some kinda internet service like coinbase to store their btc.
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:26:13
It's true I did. And it wasn't right to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:36:35
If you sell you are not doing it right.

It's "you're". Not "your".  Your second paragraph is not even a proper sentence and honestly I can't even understand what it means. Besides, aids is a condition. The virus that causes aids is HIV. You can't give someone AIDS. You can only give them HIV. 
I explained like a billion times already about the situation with the bet. I'm not gonna bother explaining it to someone who can't even build a normal sentence and types like a 1st grader. Even 1st graders don't type that badly actually. If you're done embarrassing yourself I'll wish you a nice life.

I am running one and using it to verify transactions and solo mine. Full nodes have nothing to do with 51% attacks though

Wtf. What's apple's problem? I know they always must be different from everyone else but come on.

Where exactly did I say I didn't have the btc? I haven't lied about anything. At least read the post before insulting people.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:21:49
Ok. This is on a whole another level. Salute!
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:45:25
I wonder why they don't do it then.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:28:47
I just explained why I won't shut up. If you don't like my posts or comments simply ignore them. I post them for the people who want to see them.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:27:00
Sarcasm. Cryptocurrency is very new and could fail overnight. Investing is super super risky if you don't believe in the technology behind it. There's no free lunch and thus free money.

It has a meaning to anyone who can see it. I never said I didn't have the capacity to pay. I said I couldn't afford it. Maybe no one asked for it, but after all it was an apology post where I explained what I went through. It might not be appealing to some, but it's definitely not nasty.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:18:48
That's what you think man. You don't know if I gamble, you don't know if Im lazy or not. You literally know nothing about me and judge me for it. But as I said, Ill accept the hate and the negative comments. Have a great day!
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:02:10
I would honesty be surprised, but it never hurts trying 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:36:12
try the Viabtc accelerator. Google it. Try it at exactly the hour. Like 9:00 10:00 and so on.. you will have like 10 seconds before the limit is reached 
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:57:31
Yes. And I at first was really sceptical but then I started doing some research and the more I read the more I became interested. It got to the point where I was so obsessed I was reading about it even on the bus on my way home and forgot to get out of the buss, missed my stop and had to wait 2h for the next one... just told my mom i fell asleep.
@_date: 2018-12-17 06:19:30
And this is why we can't hard fork every 2 weeks. No consensus = chainsplits and chaos. And with chaos the prices goes down and the coin dies.
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:49:34
Was it a segwit transaction? It's 99% sure that the fee wasn't 0.5 it was probably 1. It will be confirmed in a few hours. Maybe you can post a TXID?
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:49:38
This would be one of the best things he can do for Bitcoin. Go ahead, ban cryptos. That will show people how powerful and needed they really are. If they weren't, the government would just ignore them.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:46:22
What the worst that could happen really? But as of now only localhost can access the rpc so it's all good.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:17:51
No, how could you possibly think so?
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:28:42
Bitcoin has to have its blocksize increased (segwit is also a blocksize increase) in order to scale. You can a video of Andreas explaining it. Scaling is not a "this or that" decision. It's a "this or that first" one. Bitcoin will have both segwit and LN, and sidechains and Schnorr and bigger blocks etc.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:38:28
SegWit was a soft fork. So any non segwit transactions are now altcoins? No of course. Hard forks are incompatible with the legacy clients. Soft forks are backwards compatible. You want a soft fork and incompatibility(12.5 of some altcoin as you said). That just can't happen. A soft fork doesn't break consensus which means it's still perfectly legal to claim 12.5 coins and that's still bitcoin. Yes, hard forks are not defined by how many nodes enforce the rules but rather if the change(s) break consensus or not.

I know! 2 eggrolls at most.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:52:35
Yes actually. I have found one other node  which relays 0-fee. If we all connect to each other we could find a path to some miners. In fact, I was able to send a 0 fee transactions last year during the December craze when the fees were huge. It got confirmed in 2 hours.
@_date: 2018-12-26 10:55:33
Thanks! I don't get the reference though.. what's boxing day?
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:14:20
It's definitely fun. Not very easy though.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:41:14
What? Well that is strange. Another guy asked me this and then I answered and the conversion kept going on and on and now these comments can't be seen. So tldr: Heard of it, not interested, will do more research though.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:15:51
Dude, in the very first paragraph I said I wasn't honest and honorable. I also don't see why you put mistakes in quotes. There were real mistakes. Yeah of course it would be a great example, but it's not that easy to do. If it was 10 bucks, sure. But it's 1 bitcoin. You know very well how much that is. It's not as easy as flipping a coin.
@_date: 2018-12-31 09:26:00
It simply keeps trying until it finds a matching address. There are no shortcuts or tactics. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:49:36
I never said "Im too poor". I said I can't afford to pay up which is true.

Are you crazy? Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:01:01
I think I understand it very well. I  just think it's the right way. Maybe we will need on chain scaling in the future as well, but as of now SF is safer imo.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:29:51
Not as nearly as powerful. But Actually I'm happy that some people know about it. Most would use germany or Greece for example 
@_date: 2019-05-08 06:38:14
If they had enough hashpower at their disposal they could pull this off.
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:26:39
Do you realize how dumb it is to mock someone for allegedly being poor?
