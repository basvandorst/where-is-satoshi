DO NOT send these bitcoins to someone to return them unless they have a ton of confirmations, it is kind of a form of scam (I sent too much money, please return to me). Otherwise, it was someone making a mistake, likely someone you had a transaction with from this address.

Sometimes exacerbating a problem is the best way to fix it.
Think about the ebola virus for a minute; extremely lethal, killed a large percentage of its hosts within a few days, and it was scary as hell. Even though it is extremely contagious, it did not become a massive, global catastrophe because of this. If it rather laid dormant, had more subtle symptoms that progressed very slowly, and was less obvious, the "problem" would have more time to incubate, manipulate, and spread. 
If we ignore the possibility of problems like the block chain size limits, malicious miners withholding blocks, etc, they may only be theoretical problems, but we are giving them plenty of time to incubate, and the damage they will do will be far more wide spread and catastrophic. Its better to prod and see a response, and react before it causes damage.
This is in effect conducting an experiment in bitcoin as if it is a living organism; see how all of the cells of bitcoin as a whole react to a malicious attack.. we will only learn from this and benefit over the long term

I had to move out of the USA because of the banking laws as a professional poker player. Me and thousands of others were forced to exit a multi-billion dollar industry, and the US was by far the largest online poker market. 
As is now, Pokerstars has a total monopoly (Daniel's sponsor company) on the online poker world, and are scraping every penny from every player they can.
If bitcoin could provide an elegant solution, perhaps a decentralized online poker platform that is trustable, it would take the lion's share of the larger-than-bitcoins-market-cap-market that is online poker. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:58:39
this is exactly what we need to be doing; but in a more organized and scientific manner. There should be regular coordinated attacks against the theoretical weaknesses of bitcoin in order to build resilience IMO. Having the scientific method applied to this would be scary effective.

absolutely, the biggest issue nobody will pay attention to- its a massive barrier to adoption. How can we consider competing with existing fiat currencies, if we are capped at the current rate/size? How can we manage thousands of transactions a second as is? The "we will deal with it later/when it comes" is not adequate or realistic. It won't happen if its not ready before hand.

I think you have the right idea but in my opinion volatility is not as big an issue as the difficulty acquiring bitcoins. If you are not in the USA it may be difficult to find an exchange where you are not having to pay a large vig to buy bits. Also, its hard to buy bitcoins without a bank account which is a problem for the unbanked who may wish to use Bitcoin, they likely need to meet up with someone from localbitcoins and pay cash (usually at very high vig)

its just 'gold', used in jewelry and bullion, and the baht is a standarized weight. If you purchase gold, you buy "X" baht worth, or 'satang' for fractions (the currency is also the Thai Baht, and fractions of 1 baht are Satang similar to Dollars/Cents). It would be as if the US used instead of Oz a "dollar" unit for gold and 'cents' for smaller sizes. Confusing.

until there is proof of life, following the extremely suspect cirucmstances around the power outtage/closest airport shutdown/military prescence/wikileaks clinton assassination suggestion (against assange), its best to remain suspicious he is alive and well, until proven otherwise.

I had an asthma attack at my friends house once, in the States. I did not have an inhaler as I was asymptomatic for a bout a year. We went to the nearby CVS (I believe) pharmacy at around 3 AM, and they were unable to give me albuterol, even though I was obviously having an asthma attack. They had some bullshit homeopathic medicine that I had to deal with, because I could not afford an $8,000 emergency room visit, gambling with death was a better option.

He may have stolen millions of dollars from bitcointalk, but that is besides the point. The power is too centralized, and discussion is being censored.

diversify; people should have small amounts of things that are good, risky buys. Own some amount of gold, silver, index fund stocks, and perhaps even certain bonds.  Idle money is wasted money. 
Bitcoin is a highly risky, extremely profitable gamble, if you want to set-and-forget a very small portion of your net worth (~3% of monthly income each month depending on your risk tolerance). 
Why would you benefit from bitcoin? Its the best way to pay for something online. Its instant, you dont need to dig out a credit card, and theres no chance a thief will steal your identity, drain your bank account, etc. 
If you ever need to send money abroad, don't use Western Union, you can do it more securely, privately, faster, and most importantly more cheap with bitcoin. 
the $100k insurance is only as good as the money is, it is more for feel-good than actual protection. In the event it is needed, it would almost certainly be because of a huge financial disaster, not a bank screw up or robbery (they don't even have 15% of your money in the bank, its all digital).

In Thailand here, take a look at the medical tourism industry. If you get sick or need to see a dentist in the states, you can fly here round trip including four star hotels and food and a two week vacation, while getting your treatment from a doctor who got his degree from an Ivy league school in one of the best hospital in the world, and save money over go blowing your money in the states. People who come here with medical conditions that require medicine that is expensive, like me, can stroll into any pharmacy and get most medicines without a prescription, for a small fraction of the price for the same medicine in the states. 
People need healthcare and medicine. The US system is grossly unfair and expensive, and there is no freedom to self prescribe or even buy necessary medicines. I was forced to go to a hospital in the states during an asthma attack; I was in a pharmacy and they couldn't sell me albuterol which AFAIK is completely free of abuse potential. I could have died because of some archaic regulations.
There's a huge market for this, even if only targeting the US

Assuming agreement is made, when is your rough ETA (estimated time of arrival) for increased block size?
Gavin Andresen: “I think it would take anywhere from six months to a year to actually roll out that change. We have a soft fork going on, on the network now. I will be looking at how long it takes that to roll out to the majority of the network, to give me a better estimate on that.
And I’m not sure how exactly we would roll out that change. We might actually pick a date and say, eight months from now everybody is going to be validating these bunch of blocks. That would be the proposal, and that actually makes a fair bit of sense, because a hard fork is the kind of change where you need a kind of a flag day when it upgrades. As that kind of change affects both, it effects all footholds, not just the miners.”
it doesn't sound like they are ready to implement a change, not knowing how it would be put into play or how long it would take. If BTC wants to be future proofed, it should start fixing problems before they become hindrances  to further adoption.
