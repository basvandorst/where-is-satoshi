Yes, inheritances.

Bitcoin is going from deceptive to disruptive in 2014.

Poors have mental disorders, less intelligence, less education, its normal to not trust them. But we must avoid a massive poverty.

At least reducing it?
@_date: 2014-08-31 08:39:03
But banks dont give credits (in Europe at least).

Im agree, but huge inequality, independently from concepts like poverty, tends societies more violent. If you've red Piketty's book, you'll understand that greats wars are prececed by inequality.

Here in Europe your poverty according to ours is like ours according to third world. ¿No health security? Just insane.

Of course I'll do, but my first one is mine forever :D

Well, automatization is a huge phenomenon today and an employement generator that affects everybody. Poverty is an other issue, a mental issue i guess it is. But we should give everybody a basic income to prevent it.

Youre linking individual liberty and inheritance, it's okay, im agree. But its not practical: capital calls capital, the more you get, the more you get. There's a lack of oportunities there.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:36:47
Well, when you loose middle class, there's no free market: there's violence, war, and mafia. It's facts, and inequality is not cause by corruption, its cause when capital income are higher thanks to his acumulation by inheritances: that's why financial sistem is dead.

Both things are compatible. We can tax transations only for this kind of redistribution, not for political influences or market intervention.

Finally! I want to merge with machines.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:59:43
Is there new sectors absorving this workers? Maybe not enought and thats why we are leading to a post laboral society. Here in Europe, we have a high unemployement rate because labour market its not as flexible as in USA, but thanks to that we can see it easily: automatization.

The point of working will be to earn more money to be able to buy more things. Basic Income only provides enought money for food, clothes etc.

I'm more interested on the holistic effects.

Fuck yeah, sorry, I'm a Reddit noob.

What's the solution to tax bitcoin then?
