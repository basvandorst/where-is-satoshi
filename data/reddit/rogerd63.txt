Oh wow, that's sick! Thank you for the info ��

I'm not sure actually. I was leaning towards number 2 but I don't think the tx fees will be enough to cover your initial  investment.

Looks interesting...
My only concern is that you would still have to sync part of the blockchain to run the lightning network, which is not practical for the average non-tech savy user. 
I'm more interested in SPV wallets that are integrated with lightning, which are more user friendly. If there are any?
Appreciate your help btw

Well Bitcoin is already sort of centralized with mining. But I see you your point. Bitcoin Cash mining is currently centralized and future increases in block size will make it even more so.

Hey, 
I'm assuming currently we have to run a full node to have access to the lightning network. 
But is the plan for wallets such as exodus to adopt a lightning wallet, which will already be connected to a bunch of payment channels including exchanges and merchants so the end user will not have to run nodes on their computer? Also, will merchants just be able to have a wallet that is already lightning enabled? 
Not sure if this is what zap is working on.
Sorry to bother you again haha

I must say this is probably the best analogy of lightning I have seen to date. 
Thank you for your insight
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:02:31
Good point
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:06:14
I think the main argument on why the lightning network is centralized is due to major hubs such as exchanges that will route users transactions to other locations. Users are sort of incentivized to use these major hubs because of lower fees due to less hopping between nodes and the many payment channels that these hubs are connected to. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:59:26
What if a major hub decides to close all channels or goes offline? Surely, this will cause some sort of chaos. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:20:23
Yes, I know that you don't have to close a payment channel. However, the main question was on-boarding new bitcoin users on to LN, which requires an on-chain transaction. If you have a lot of new incoming users wanting to use the LN, the blocks will become full, hence higher fees, and lower user adoption on to LN. 
You haven't really explained your argument of why this is not true, which may be an indication of your lack of knowledge on this topic.

Never knew about channel factories. This basically solves the problem. Thank you! 
But seems like you would still require at least one on chain transaction. However, i suspect this fee to be low if channel factories does in fact get adopted.

Well said
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:15:42
How so?
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:07:45
Lol then how does this "company" solve the issue of an on chain transaction to get onto LN? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:29:16
How do we know if that's actually Roger? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:07:27
What do you mean by "wont really be your bitcoin" ? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:53:14
Are you saying that Bitcoin users who currently transact on chain will switch to LN and transact via Lightning and as a result, this will take a load off the main chain, reduce fees, and allow new users (ppl who are using bitcoin for the first time) to open payment channels at low cost? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:57:31
Coinbase lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:25:02
Even if you don't own the private keys, coinbase would still have to make an on-chain transaction on your behalf to on-board people to the LN. 
Are you saying there is a service that will not require an on-chain transaction to open up an initial payment channel?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:36:32
So there is a third party company that has a payment channel setup with Coinbase who will route payments for Coinbase customers? 
Do you have a link to this project?
