It's ok... You can be one of those non-believers, everyone has a right to their own opinion.  I just feel very bad for you in 10 years when you maybe realize..."Oh shit I should of bought bitcoin instead of just drank HATERaid all day while viewing Good luck with your hatred of Bitcoin!

I have a lot of the classics, spider man, flash, fantastic four and more.  I can snap pictures and get more titles if interested.
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:43:28
What year are they from?
Not to jack your thread but I have a bunch of 1969-70's comics I wouldn't mind trading for some bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:42:34
With so much happening with Bitcoin I am just going to chuckle at your comment.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:19:02
Looks like you are off to a rough start.
Apparently, you scammed another user on Flippa and he wants the domain you scammed him on.

Trolls going to troll, haters going to hate.  
Honey Badger is not worried at all.

Do you know how cryptowall infected you?  You use IE?  Download?  I am very curious how people get infected with this.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:02:44
LOL I AM not SURE!
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:50:54
Couple hundred bitcoins... nice.   My circle account is giving me problems... want to make some money? :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:13:52
37k coins and another 9k sold in a couple of days.
@_date: 2014-10-02 19:53:51
I likes.  
Surprised not 1 troll has commented yet.
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:59:11
They appear to be buying in small amounts very fast in weird increments, and then they buy up a chunk anywhere from 30-70 coins.
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:43:00
I have a pretty big collection of old comics from late 60's to early 70's.  Would love to trade for coins :)
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:59:50
What do you know... I will be in Orlando this weekend as well.  Going.
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:44:54
I would like to see $300-350 so I can accumulate more coins... but would have to agree it seems real steady right around $380 range.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:44:45
Hey gloomfrost, go fuck yourself... I was asking for opinions here not assholes.  Does there have to be value in a friendly conversation? 
Piss off.  Don't have anything nice to say,,, then keep your fucking mouth shut.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:30:16
What is up with the picture showing buy/sells.  Appears your BOT bought at $383 then took a loss and sold at $373?
I would love to see a longer history timeline of buys/sells
Would the longer timeline show your bot actually losing money?
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:03:49
I bought some hot sauce.

@_date: 2014-10-09 15:19:25
It is easily explained.  The price fluctuated before you finally locked in your order.

I wonder how much money you are making spamming all those BetMoose referral links?

Hrmm..on what?
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:36:57
Decreasing short would mean traders are not betting the price to go any lower.
Instead it seems traders are going long now, expecting the price to rise?
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:12:03

Just tried to deposit this morning with verified bank account and got the following error:
"oops something went wrong, please try again or contact support
tried again 2-3 times and same shit.
Email and Contacted support and they told me this is a known bug, and that they are trying to fix it.
Couldn't do anything else except tell me to wait and they will email me when fixed.   BAH!
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:31:25
Your mom's butthurt.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:42:44
Sure, which should likely mean we are on the way back up.
 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:53:58
Too much butthurt for you.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:40:52
You know there is a 50/50 chance you are correct 
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:19:39
You must be a bot shouting randomness.  Your comment has nothing to do with my post.
Your mom is holding my bag.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:46:07
You are just full of butthurt.
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:17:29
I am not saying anything will.  I find the price difference odd.
Care to add something useful to your comment?  Like a response to my question?
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:38:37
Ahhh I must be missing this reference? Care to link?
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:14:51
It helps if you look at the overall chart.
That will help you realize that we will have up's and down's.
If you believe in the technology, then hang on...if you are in it to get rich quick then I suggest getting out now.
It is one hell of a ride for sure!
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:18:03
Maybe, that's it?  Gut?  Give me some fancy chart pattern names.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:38:00
Oh and I forgot to mention that 2 security questions, 1 I answered right... the other I must have typo'd and they couldn't see if it was typo or not.

Sexy interface...wonder how volume will look in a week.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:38:41
I never kept my bitcoins in their wallet... as soon as I bought them I transferred them to my own wallet :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:36:56
Oh wait bubbaspare, you mean to tell me that I personally called in and verified multiple personal details about myself.
Yeah, I did... and they still could not do anything.
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:48:59
You get 3.3:1 leverage at bitfinex.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 17:47:10
I think I get it now...delay...LOL!
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:54:28
Wheeeee, I love roller coaster's.
The technology is insane.  You agree?
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:15:49
Good idea, but $122 for trading almost 1,500 BTC is pennies.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:51:52
The majority of the coins in the wallet are not small transactions.  I did however receive probably 20ish transactions at .001 so I assume this is the reason why the fees are high as you stated.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:53:07
Yeah, as shark256 stated above... I did receive about 20 or so .001 transactions.  I forget about those small transactions till was mentioned above.  Solved.  Thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-13 01:52:09
There is also one if you search for LOCALBITCOINS :  BEWARE!

You all should not use 'Coinbase' as your username.  I just requested the PW on Sendgrid and sure enough it is a valid account.
BTW Ignore that.  Was curious! 
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:40:52

@_date: 2015-02-23 13:30:49
I see this as more of a honeypot for cops to sit and watch and then make illegal search and seizure's.  Anonymous?  How so when someone has to physically pick up items?

Would be nice to know when thousands of btc(@ a single time) will stop being dumped on exchanges.

Why would you say no one is taking long positions?
Am I reading into something wrong on that URL?
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:39:01
Where are servers located, keep logs, and for the affiliate program you payout in BTC?
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:58:22
Gotcha, so the URL I linked to is non-leveraged positions.  Thanks
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:36:05
They actually do.  All someone has to do is file a complaint about false information and they can suspend your domain name until you verify your identity.  Best to pay for the whois privacy guard.

The random garbage replies I get, my lord jahosafat.
@_date: 2015-02-19 00:26:01
I am curious as to why the reply-to in the headers is:  automated
When munister replied back the email went to that address? 
How was the phisher able to reply back if it went to legit btcjam.com URL?
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:12:19
It's definitely like someone shitting on your frosted flakes man.
It sucks.  When price goes back up they will disappear and that will mean Bitcoin will have won.

Shit, anything with value can be used to buy drugs.  I have heard about people using their food stamp card to buy drugs.

People did start crowd-funding for him and got I think $44,000 raised for him.
They are even n setting aside funds for insurance, gas, and maintenance.  
Looks like he will not be walking soon anymore.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:25:02
Imagine the possible end number when you factor in all the lost/unaccssable Bitcoin. Less than 21 million for sure.

Etherum I thought still had something like 30K coins they were selling?
