If this is not a top indicator, I don't know what is.

Screw those big-blocker scum.
You wanna shut down my raspberry Pi full node in the Alaskan wilderness? FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!

We don't need a block size increase. We need a block size decrease to 300kb, as Luke Jr pointed out months ago.
I for one, am quite willing to pay 1000 dollar transaction fees, if it ensures I'm able to run a full node on my raspberry Pi. Bitcoin was never meant to pay for your coffee. In fact, it was never meant to pay for anything worth less than 2 million dollar.

Congrats, you're the target demographic

I'm fine with not participating. Either it succeeds and turns the world into a dystopian nightmare, or it falls apart and everyone who participated loses a lot of money.

TOP INDICATOR

Oh noes, I guess I'll have to invest all the money I saved on transaction fees on upgrading my Raspberry Pi

Forking would create two versions of bitcoin, with users of old software stuck using the old version. In addition, miners would have to support the implementation of software changes that have the effect of rendering their business model obsolete. In practice nobody is going to go along with that.

I'm not a big blocker. I just want some help with operating a tab through bitcoin.

I used Fibionacci analysis, to determine that 17400 dollar was the correct moment to step in. I maxed out all my credit cards to allow me to afford two bitcoins.

History demonstrates that it generally tends to be the reluctant skeptics who end up holding the bag.
I'm sorry for your loss.

Except for the whole part where the mempool now has 200 satoshi per byte transactions that are no longer being confirmed. How deep do you guys think the pockets of these miners go? The blocks are now simply full, due to the large numbers of users.

You'll spend more on transaction fees than on the tulips themselves.

You're so focused on the fact that you can, that you forget to ask yourself whether you should.

Whoever thinks using a household's weekly energy use per transaction is sustainable earns a crackpot flag in my mind.

You sound like an intelligent person who has made a significant contribution to humanity with your life.
