there will be plenty of miners willing to take 12,5 btc reward. I dont think the price will spike but it is an incentive for the price to rise. 
You are worried that miners will drop? MIners come and go, that is how I see it. If the bitcoin price is explodes and somehow people can have acces to cheap or maybe free electricity... they will keep on mining. 
And if not, the old generation drops out and a new generation of miners will pick up the mining game.

you did not answer my question. Why did you not answer my question? instead you say I dont understand this and that. You dont even know me. I am sorry if you lost all your money in enron and worldcom, but it has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Many hands will fold. People holding large amounts of bitcoin will be smaller in the future. There are many weak hands, but also people who need to spend bitcoin. 
In 5 years the amount of people with more than 10k coin will not be higher than 100. Heck maybe no one has 10k coin. People with 100 to 1000 coins will be rich. Lets say the price will be 100k per coin in 5 years that makes it net worth of 10 to 100 mill. That is rich but does not make you a billionair.

It is clear we both have a different view on this. I see the positive things in bitcoin, of course it is not perfect. Like big players dominating the network. But a creditcoin will also be dominated by 1 one entity, that means the entity is in control of the market unlike bitcoin. I can not predict the future, but I am positive it will work out. 
okay now a question for you
what are the odds for a 'creditcoin' to come out of the blue and taking over bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:12:42
I know some ways but I dont have to list them. The focus was on the concept 'smart' money. New apps can be built around the bitcoin protocol. And I admit I don't know what kind of apps will be built, but the possibilities are endless.

I expect you to post in 1 year:
is $50,000 by end of year possible now ? What do you think ? Chime in with your thoughts here.
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:37:34
Honest opinion. Nobody knows.
- 2013 Low: $13 High: $1160            --&gt; 89x increase
- 2014 Low: $340 High: $340 x 89 = $30,260.00
Who would predict a ATH of 1160 in january 2013? Anyway, I expect next quarter more giant companies to accept bitcoin (rallY). The EFT should be launched in last quarter of 2014 (rally). This should give a positive signal to hedge, pension, venture capitalists managers to diversify their portfolio in the 1st quarter of 2015 (steady gain in price). I am not saying 30k or 10k by the end of this year is realistic,  but the next steady adoption could be involving millions of people.....this could be the vertical growth of the S curve growth. After 2013 low of $13 to a high of $1160, I think we shouldn't underestimate bitcoin. 
imo: 10K is possible but not expected.

- Anyone can create an altcoin that is functionally identical to Bitcoin.
- Similarly all the VC money flowing into Bitcoin companies is being spent on building technologies and services that are broadly applicable to all crypto currencies.
- Adoption rates are still very very low
1. It is the network you can't create just like that. Just like facebook, you can make a social profile site. but try to beat facebook.
2. 'all crypto'? yup It is practically the same litecoin, peercoin etc. But go read 1.
3. Its slow, but it will change. Be patient. 1-2 years. new users grow exponential

You are right. I'll admit that there is a probability that a 'corporate coin' will appear trying to compete with bitcoin. But I think the probalility is low in this early stage of bitcoin. Bitcoin will get to the mainstream before any cooin will compete. Major players needs to see that bitcoin works before they create anything similar.
For now bitcoin is miles ahead. And if any major players try to make a coin now they will be needing 1000s tech guys ASAP to keep it up. You make it sound easy, but it is not. Bitcoin will be mainstream before any corporate coin will be introduced that might co-exist or replace bitcoin. 
e.g. 
- Bitcoin mainstream --&gt; maybe later corporate coin
- Nokia mainstream --&gt; Apple/samsung
- Altavista/yahoo --&gt; google
- windows microsoft --&gt; OS, linux etc.
- explorer/netscape --&gt; chrome/firefox

10,000% gain = $43,500.00
Why not?
pff 100,000% gain = $435,000.00 is even possible. but -100% is also possible;).

This could be a very long bubble. [30.06.2014 - Low $598,00 --- end of bubble 2015 2nd quarter] 
With news like california declaring bitcoin to be 'legal', this should push adoption of bitcoin. Yes I know, bitcoin wasn't illegal in the first place. But this should attract new investors who were sceptical. I expect at least 1 giant company to accept bitcoin within this quarter. 
We also have the ETF launched in the last quarter of 2014, this should give a massive spike. 
First quarter of 2015 should also be bullish. I expected hedge/pension/venture funds managers to also add bitcoin into their portfolio. 
damn I am excited!

@_date: 2014-06-26 22:28:33
The nice thing about bitcoin is the decentralization. You talk about visa/mastercard/banks creating a network, that is not decentralization. Everyone can put up a network, but you need people willing to use it. If it is in hands of 'someone' there is no point for people like us to use that person's network. $250 million to create a network, that can be done. But for millions of people to use your network is a different story. I wouldnt gamble $250 million to create a network with a high probability no one is going to use your network. That is why they can't beat the bitcoin network (yet?). People choose bitcoin over a CreditCoin any day. 
And I agree, wall street can take out the early adopters from 2010-2011. The new investors of 2013-2014 will be harder to take out. 
I am just positive in the future of bitcoin. Bitcoin has not reach its full potential. Bitcoin is now used as a currency, but in 2019 or 2030 it could be used for something completely different. That is also a reason why I dont see something replacing bitcoin anytime soon. We have to see its true nature before someone can make something better. Bitcoin is the only network now that has the best environment to 'test' new applications like colored coins.

He just does not want to lose his credibility. Of course he should stick to his projections. He is an university professor! Of course he did his homework and learned everything about bitcoin. He is smart and knows what he is talking about... and I give him until the 30th. if the price is not $10 or lower, he should quit his job.
serieusly.. this is an university professor? He has no clue at all. All he does was looking at the charts and not believing his eyes bitcoin rose from $13 to $1160 in one year. Of course bitcoin can drop to 0, but in 6 months?  No fantasy and not open minded at all?
About 1 thing he is right, money flows easily out of the market. If he thinks 99% of the market can flow out in 6 months due bad news, imagine what money can flow IN with good news in 6 months! markie, i see what you did there.
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:19:45
I know. The price was going down all day yesterday (610 or lower on bitstamp) and I expected it to down further when suddenly it 'spiked' within an hour (629 bitstamp ). So according to you this is just a random spike?
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:42:59
Bitcoin will be more than just a currency. This is where decentralization comes into the picture. The trust of the network and cutting out the middle man.
For now decentralization seems not important for the average consumer, but it will in the future. And that is why the average consumer don't own any bitcoin now. Bitcoin will evolve and then the average consumer will choose for decentralization.
If visa/mastercard/amex creates a coin, they still need to make money of it making it more expensive than bitcoin. money transfer is the main market for visa/mastercard. But for bitcoin the money transfer part is just one the many markets will be active. Bitcoin will be usable in many other markets and imo the main reason why bitcoin be better than credit coin.

If someone got 50 -60% of the bitcoins, that person is in control of the market. If he holds, price can go up depending on demand for bitcoin. But if he sells because he wants dollars/euros/cny, the price drops like a rock. So the market is still volatile because of a big hodler imo. The price will be higher but not because a big whale (infrastructure of bitcoin is more complete by then). Furthermore, i think it's impossible to have 11 million bitcoins for yourself.
This is what happens now. Early adoptes of bitcoin vs newcomers. Early adoptes are now selling their bitcoins at a fair price. Bitcoins are exchanging hands. The % big holders are dropping slowly. 
Imagine this, you now have 10 bitcoins and in 5 years the price of 1 mBTC is $125,00 a piece. There are people who need money/want to spend money and can't hold forever. Would you sell? 1 bitcoin for 125,000.00! The newbies in 5 years would tell you to hodl until price reaches $1000,00 for 1 mBTC. 
This is what happens now, big hodlers with 1000-10000 BTC are selling (not everything but little by little) for a fair price. The newbies (like me) are buying and cannot believe why people are selling their bitcoins. This cycle will go on and bitcoins will change hands and this goes on. This cycle will make the price go to the moon (and not a big holder). 
In 5 to 10 years for the 'age 20-30 year' generation owning 10 -100 mBTC will be a  very VERY big deal.

My view; 
Halving the reward means deflation. If the bitcoin ecosystem is more evolved in 2 years and demand is stronger than supply, the price will rise. As said in earlier comments, miners will be experts, miners will  selltheir mined bitcoins for a higher price. 
but then again, a lot can happen in 2 years. New miners will come and old miners will leave. If you're not satisfied with 12,5 BTC then quit your mining. There will be many others that will take the reward.
same situation:
people who bought bitcoin at $3 in 2011/2012 a piece are less likely to buy bitcoin at $630. But in 2014 people are willing to buy bitcoin at $630 (even at $1160 in december 2013). 
relax.. don't underestimate mr. satoshi, it will work out.

Be patient. $1000 is nothing, Bitcoin will be worth $10k or more. And wall street will keep buying. This should be the exponential explosion in the s-curve with thousands percentage yearly gain Who wouldnt invest in bitcoin;).

A big mac here in the netherlands is 3,50 euro. 50 bits is 1/20000 of a bitcoin, meaning the price should be 3,50 * 20,000 which makes a bitcoin worth 70,000 euro a bitcoin. Currently exchange rate for eur/usd is 1.36; 70k *1,36 = $95,200 for a bitcoin.

Well done sherlock. That is how it works. If I sold 0.01 btc for $10k. The price for 1 bitcoin is $1 million
If i buy 1 hamburger for 1 dollar.
then 1000 hamburgers is 1000 dollars. 
I hope you can still handle all the calculations when we go to mBTC or bits as notation.
