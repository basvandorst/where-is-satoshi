I don't see this as a big problem.

True, but I don't believe the SEC will sign off on this. 
I'm going to try to buy before the 11th though if my tax return comes in by that time.

Well they've been waiting for 3+ years to file this of course they're going to go through with it...
Do you honestly think the Winks would withdraw the application at this point? Pretty sure they're going to see it through.

Average person is not like you though. That's his whole point.

Pretty sure the prospectus is part of normal filing procedures. In which case this is indicative of absolutely nothing.

Fair enough.
I'm still bearish on the ETF though.

I like to think they pay for their ads with my hard earned cash

That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. The federal law enforcement is a threat for dispensaries but when's the last time you got pulled over by a federal law enforcement officer?
Are the federal law enforcement officers walking the streets of your neighborhood? 
Holy shit people are dumb. Do you think hundreds of thousands of federal law enforcement are going to be raiding peoples backyards and kitchens?
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:26:39
Lol yeah when people are walking down the streets smoking jays I'm sure they'll be on the lookout for federal law enforcement.
And the people in Colorado and Washington and Oregon are quaking in their boots because of the feds as they smoke weed everywhere and now in Colorado in bars.

Actually it sounds rational. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:48:44
I don't even smoke anymore lol... Nor do I advertise all my purchases.
But I do get your point. Thing is these things have to happen for federal law to catch up. Weed will be federally legal in less than half a decade with so many states (California most of all) legalizing it recreationally.
Plus if it's legal people can still choose to smoke on the downlow like they've been doing for decades. No need to advertise anything

What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.
 I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

The word "dispensary" is not in your post.
