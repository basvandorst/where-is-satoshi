autocorrect, you mean like using iOS? 
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:04:23

@_date: 2015-05-08 15:12:12

Hi, thanks for bringing this up. I didn't intend to blog "spam" reddit as btcisgod said. bitts is actually brand new, and I'm trying out different things including posting to reddit. bitts is a work in progress and [I appreciate all the feedback the community has given me so far!]( More to come soon, thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:55:13
leave a btc address in the post, or use Disqus to start a conversation. i will tip anyone using disqus/changetip too!

on the long articles: i put in a limit of 9-10K characters. i guess i didn't think people would post more than that many, but hey, this is why I asked for testing. I will increase the limit, but I think it would be unlikely to have many posts with that many characters.
about the error message, i'm not sure what happened. i'll take a look at the logs and check it out. thanks. 1 donut

Your bitcoins are safe (although we don't need a judge to make them safer!). 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:47:10
thank you so much, i'm tipping all posts on bitts! so check your btc address. if you have additional feedback, please let me know!
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:26:04
thanks, tip sent. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:23:39
cool, since you are the first to comment here and participate, I'm going to give you a tip here too!
$1 thanks for testing! 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:30:23
ok, i'm tipping every post with a btc address! check your btc address. also, if you can, test the comments on Disqus, I will tip there too (via changetip).
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:55:28
check again, let me know, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:24:10

@_date: 2015-05-08 16:55:37
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:56:13
thanks, i'll have to check into it more then. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:00:21
so the issue is the smaller view? i need to work on the "mobile friendliness" of the site (the CSS). i wonder if it has to do with the embedded view too, I'll have to check into that too further. 
thanks, here is a donut :) 
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:25:50
tip has been sent, thanks for testing! :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:57:23
thanks. i plan to make the search more robust :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:32:35
cool, the great thing about bitcoin is i have no way to tie your btc address to your identity (so i don't know which post is yours). so check your btc address, i'm tipping all posts with btc addresses!
