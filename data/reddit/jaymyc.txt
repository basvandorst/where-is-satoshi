Well played sir. Your good luck will no doubt continue ��

Check your bank. Most U.K. banks are cancelling the transfers and refunding with 5-7 working days. 
I’m with Natwest and from the moment I transfer (working hours) it has taken a max of 2 hours to hit my euro wallet. 
Alternatively, use coinfloor - express buy. 
You lose money with the bank in conversion charges anyway.

Until someone hacks coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:12:58
Can you tell me how many you bought so I don’t have to read all of that ☝️
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:16:24
Fuck it. It wasn’t meant to be. Chin up pal 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:50:22
If you’re working and don’t need savings, fire it in. How much money are we talking 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:06:42
Pay taxes

On coinfloor? 
It says “only deposit to this account in Euro” 
The Estonia account? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:07:29
You’re right. If everybody doesn’t pay.......

I saw on their homepage that they are suspending withdrawals at midnight for fork activity. Not sure why these haven’t been done, especially after so long ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:40:15
Has yours cleared yet? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:17:47
Been nailed by bank conversion charges 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:35:01
Coinfloor are a huge exchange, should be ok 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:49:04
Yeh. Maybe that’s slowed withdrawals down for some reason. It’s usually pretty instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:41:05
Same. It’s usually pretty much instant but mine has been queued for hours. Not sure what’s happening 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:52:21
Will do. Mine is £10k. How much is yours ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:11:07
Shit!

These are short term issues. 
Forks are happening because people that don’t have the creativity to invent bitcoin are given an opportunity to create their own currency. They will all get rich off it whilst the loyal “early adopters” trade off their bitcoin for whatever forked BS opportunity comes their way. 
If everyone followed the above, altcoins and forked coins wouldn’t have the momentum to cause a threat. They cause a threat because all of you jump all over them, FOMO’ing your balls off in case you miss the next *1000 value increase. 
Bitcoin was supposed to be anti society. Not trading futures on platforms and buying and selling to make a raise every time their is a dip or raise in perceived value. This is a major cause of the volatility which stops Joe Average from converting his wages into bitcoin. It causes the fear of “what if I lose it all”. 
If you converted your wages to euro or usd you wouldn’t have these fears.

Just received. I always forget how much you lose when sending through your bank in euro. Scandalous.
