When the local negros decided to rob us with guns and steal our cars the police did basically nothing. When one pulled an ak47 on me at a traffic light nothing. When my business failed to get a new permit for occupancy for a space we had been in 16 years they sent the fucking swat team. Government is a protection racket. Nothing more. Stop believing in imaginary hobgoblins coming to get you.

You seem to be under the impression that the vote tallies are representative of the debate for something like tsa. Voting against the aviation and transportation security act would be seen as political suicide and no politician would have the stones to do it. This does not mean they wanted a cabinet level department with hundreds of thousands of new employees.
Our nation has gone well down the path to becoming a totalitarian police state where the ideals of freedom it was founded upon are little more than a footnote in history. There are many things that government could be doing which would be far more effective than clamping down on the citizenry and their financial transactions to root out potential terrorists. We could start with basic things like securing the borders, keeping track of visa abusers, and (gasp) coming down hard on muslims who are at the root of the problem. What we are seeing is government destroying fundamental principals of the US which in an Ironic twist of fate is precisely what the fundamentalist nutjobs flying planes into buildings want.

The American people were whipped into a hysterical state of fear and anyone foolish enough to oppose government 'doing something' would be demagogued out of office.


With all of the multi billion dollar wars and more government over reach in areas like health care, crashing the economy and things like that the dumb masses that make up the majority of the electorate are a tad overwhelmed.


Really? I had a very different conversation with a former Soviet citizen last week. Watching what has happened in the US in the 20 years they have been here is unsettling to say the least.


You should put the bong down. There are more than 20 million illegals here. In what way does that even resemble secure borders?


Nobody in their right mind wants that. I think isolation is the way to go. Failing there, history is replete with hundreds of incidents of genocidal wars with muslims.

You are missing the point. This thing is just the tip of the iceburg. It needs to be stopped in its tracks NOW.

What has the approval rating of congress been for the last decade? What percentage of the electorate actually votes? What happened to the last anti establishment party that appeared to be making real headway? There is no mandate the game is rigged the political class has us by the balls and has no intention of letting that change.


Next to healthcare banking is the most heavily regulated industry in the US. Moronic laws like [The Financial Services Modernization Act]( and [The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]( set the stage for the economic collapse that came a few years later by unshackling the banking parasites and allowing them to pillage unchecked. Did you really just cite a Rolling Stone article about finance? 


20 million undocumented illegals committing crimes, using services, sending billions in remittances out, bankrupting hospitals and you do not see this as a threat to the sanctity of the state? 


Nobody said anything about ceding the world stage. I am talking about fencing them in their own little muslim paradise. No more screwing around with their stupid jihadi bullshit. Any act of violence outside their existing areas should be met with overwhelming and deadly force. 


We are in agreement there. We should also close ALL overseas bases with about half a dozen exceptions to allow us to maintain easy global power projection.

WHY ISLAMIC CONQUESTS? Islamic scholarship divides the world in two: 1) The House of Islam (dar al-Islam): Nations submitted to Islamic rule. 2) The House of War (dar al-harb): Nations that have not submitted to Islam but must be submitted according to Islamic doctrine. Thus, Muslims (dar al-Islam) believe they must make war upon non-Muslims (dar al-harb) until all nations submit to the will of Allah and accept Sharia law.
Islam's message: Submit or Be Conquered.

* Black slaves were castrated by Muslims as they were believed to have uncontrollable sexual appetites. While most slaves bound for the Americas were brought for agricultural purposes, slaves bound for Arab countries were used for sex and the military. Twice as many women as men were enslaved by Muslims. But most of the children born to these women were killed. The death toll from 1400 years of the Arab slave trade is estimated to be between 112 and 140 million.


Yeah talking to Boco Haram did a whole lot of good for the hundreds of girls kidnapped. The muslim religion is spread by the sword and must be stopped that way. The only real exception I have found to this rule is in the [Ismiali sect]( from India/Pakistan who have a lot of Buhddist concepts.

I am going to start by addressing this because I do not believe you want to actually face the truth about the hysteria surrounding what happened. The formation of TSA was debated strenuously and opposed by Republicans who did not want more federal bureaucracy incapable of performing anything but security kabuki theater. The position of the statists was best summed up by Democrat Tom Daschle who said during the debate "You don't professionalize unless you federalize" Now we have legions of morons confiscating shampoo bottles and fingernail clippers but missing firearms. 


The problem is the politically correct bs dance that tsa does. Israel is far more effective and far less intrusive with their security screening. They profile.


The illegal numbers runners of 40 years ago have children running state lotteries. This is all about protecting the states revenue. Nothing else.
