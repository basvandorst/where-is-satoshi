There's also a good chance that 20GB contains the routing and account numbers of anyone who had bank accounts linked to MtGox for the purpose of withdrawals or deposits.  **If you had any accounts linked to MtGox or issued a wire transfer at any time, you should contact your bank and inform them your account details may have been compromised.**

It is.  Prosecutors will do everything they can to make it harder for you to mount a defense, including freezing your assets so you cannot hire a decent attorney.  I find the practice despicable.
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:22:40
Thanks.  I knew there were risks, and could it have been much worse.  Hopefully, the lessons learned from this experience will help me avoid a more catastrophic loss in the future.

It may be a good deal worse if the database contains information about linked bank accounts or a history of wire transfers.  That information has the potential to be far more devastating.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:16:22
This is true (at least in the U.S.), but it still has the potential to be a bigger headache than a preemptive call to your bank to have your account number changed, or possibly adding some sort of flag to the account requiring verification of outbound transfers.
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:45:54
I've always assumed it's because the costs involved in banks overhauling their procedures (and infrastructure?) would be so great that the banks would rather deal with fraudulent transfers on a case-by-case basis.

Bank of America offers a plastic card.  I have it enabled for all external transfers (i.e., transfers to accounts that aren't mine).  But I'm not sure if you can configure your account to require 2FA simply to log in the online banking site.  AFAIK, it's also only used with online banking; I don't think it protects you from unauthorized withdrawals via ACH, wire transfer, etc.

And the balance here is reported at ~950k BTC.  They said they lost ~750k of customer coins?  That leaves ~200k BTC.  Wasn't there just a big transfer of 180-200k BTC in the past couple days that was thought to be controlled by MtGox?  I'm not seeing "proof" of anything new here.

In many areas, it's still difficult to subscribe to television or mobile phone services without handing over your SSN.  It was worse a decade ago, but things are still pretty bad.

There was an IRC excerpt floating around here in which MagicalTux said something to the effect of "we did not include BTC in the liabilities because we intend to return BTC as BTC".

Goddammit.  Is it even legal for MtGox to retain a passport scan once a user has been verified?  I'm pretty sure there are regulations about that sort of thing in many countries.  I have no idea about Japan.

It may well be different in Europe (I live in the U.S.).  The most recent outbound bank transfer I performed was two days ago, and the only bank details I needed were my routing and account numbers.  No PIN, no password of any kind on the bank side.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:30:56
I am not qualified to answer the second part of your question, but in the U.S., all I have ever needed to move money in or out of a bank account is the bank/routing number and account number, and perhaps some personal information (the kind MtGox would have for verified accounts).
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:51:05
Interesting.  Did the ruling protect the practice, i.e., prevent credit card providers from disallowing it?  Or did they simply rule that the practice couldn't be banned by law?

I should be surprised, but I'm not--not after everything else I've read about this company.
Perhaps, in addition to financial and security audits, we should be demanding audits of code and change management from the Bitcoin exchanges and wallet services we continue to do business with.  I work as a programmer at a major investment bank, and our change/release management procedures are rather elaborate.  There is no reason the same should not be demanded of Bitcoin institutions.  Clearly, giving benefit of the doubt is insufficient.

Two transactions sending BTC **to** MtGox:

More like they get robbed, and the robbers leave holographic stacks of cash in place of the original cash.  Everything looks good, even upon visual inspection.  Until someone actually tries to withdraw something.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:40:57
Nothing.  It really is that simple.  Getting away with a fraudulent transfer, on the other hand, is more difficult.  The banks will simply reverse a fraudulent transfer (or chain of transfers), and the person on the receiving end will, I believe, be liable for the amount if it cannot be retrieved (possibly in the form of a negative balance).  But I have never heard of someone in the U.S. not getting their money back when an unauthorized transfer takes place.  I do not know if that is due to legal requirements or bank policy.
My assumption has always been that banks would rather assume the risk and deal with fraud on a case-by-case basis than face the larger costs associated with revamping their procedures and infrastructure.

The penthouse in my building (midtown Manhattan) rents for $30,000/month.  There are far more expensive units in the area.  But such units usually span an entire floor, and are considerably larger than 1BR.
Given the cost of living in Tokyo, it's not unthinkable, though the 1/10 corrected price seems far more reasonable.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:11:55
Still, until everyday people are paid in BTC, most will continue to view their bitcoins' value in terms of USD or some other currency.  Habit and lack of familiarity no doubt play a part; Bitcoin is different in many ways from what people are used to.  It will also be a while before the exchange rates really start to level out.  They're more stable than they have been in the past, but we still have a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:51:57
The fact that Bitcoin is unregulated or unrecognized as a currency does not mean one cannot be prosecuted for crimes related to its theft.  If an exchange were to just run off with its customers funds, BTC or otherwise, they could be charged with fraud, larceny, or any number of crimes, depending on the jurisdiction.  And that's just on the criminal side--there's the potential for civil action too.  In either case, the coin would likely be treated as a sort of commodity/property, as opposed to money, and damages/repayment would probably be paid in fiat based on market value.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:24:59
If they know the customer's bank/routing and account numbers, that's enough to be a big problem.  All I've ever needed to move money in or out of a bank account in the U.S. are those numbers and some personal information (which MtGox would have, at least for verified accounts).  It's always seemed like a horrifyingly insecure system to me.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:34:25
If they have the source code, passport scans, and a database dump, there is a very good chance they also have the routing and account numbers of anyone who had a bank account linked to MtGox for withdrawals or deposits.  **If you had any accounts linked to MtGox or initiated a wire transfer at any time, call your bank and tell them your account details may have been compromised.**

I was registering with an online payment service to pay my rent (I recently moved into a new building).  I had never done business with this company before, and they are definitely not a bank.  They appear to be a third party service not directly related to the real estate company or the building management company, so they wouldn't have seen the bank cheques I used to pay my security deposit or first month's rent at the lease signing.
When I created my profile on their website, I had provided my name, address, e-mail, and phone number.  I never provided any sort of ID, nor a cheque.  To set up the transfer, I only needed the routing and account numbers.  It was not an insubstantial amount of money, either (~9600 USD).  The transfer went through without a hitch, and not a word from my bank about it.
Also, this is the first time I had initiated any external transfer to or from this particular account.  In the past, I had only transferred money in or out of it from another account at the same bank.  It didn't trip any "suspicious activity" alarms, though that could very well be because the bank considers activity across *all* of a customer's accounts.  Still, the system over here has never given me the warm and fuzzies.

Not double-checking their records against the blockchain is a bit like not inspecting the giant heaps of not-actually-withdrawable cash more closely, no?  Okay, so it was a silly analogy.

There was a law passed to protect a merchant's right to impose up to a $10 minimum charge for credit card purchases.  Previously, most creditors explicitly forbade merchants from imposing any such minimum (and still forbid minimums higher than the legally protected $10).
I haven't heard of a law like the one you describe, though.  Regardless, the OP never claimed it was illegal; just that it was a violation of most creditors' merchant agreements.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:45:22
Yes, but in contrast to Bitcoin, fraudulent bank transfers are easily reversed.  Still, I imagine there is some headache involved, not to mention the feeling of being violated and possibility of not having access to your money for however long it takes to resolve the matter.
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:58:38
I don't know whether that's true or not, but whatever additional information may be required is likely in the same MtGox database as the account numbers.
And yes, I do realize those numbers are printed on the bottom of every cheque I write.  FYI, last time I bought a car, I wrote a cheque, and the dealer just initiated an ACH transfer for the amount on the cheque instead of actually cashing it.

What you describe has happened with every major currency or commodity in history.  Human greed is a universal invariant.  Why would Bitcoin be an exception?  Any why is this necessarily a bad thing?  Greed is neither intrinsically good nor bad; it is simply human.  You cannot defeat it, so you may as well embrace it for what it is.

I have initiated external bank transfers without stepping foot in my bank or even using my bank's website.  Things are pretty simple over here in the United States.  Granted, it's also pretty easy to reverse a fraudulent transfer, but it can still be a headache (quite possibly a bigger headache than a preemptive phone call).

The database dump may include the bank routing and account numbers of anyone who had their bank account linked to MtGox for withdrawals or deposits.  Combined with the personal info they would have for verified accounts, that's pretty disastrous.
