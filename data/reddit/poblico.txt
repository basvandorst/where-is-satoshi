This is actually very good to explain the potential of Blockchain to the people

From what I understand everything is aes encrypted on top of tls, both parties know the other public key. So why relying on tls?

You have a blockchain app on windows phone, just saying...
Edit: providing the link 
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:41:03


And yet in your title you did not mention anything about it being a theoretical illustration, but rather of fact on altcoins which is a bit misleading.
OK yes this is a described weakness of bitcoin 51% attack illustrated on alt coins, if an alt coin will have a strong community of miners this attack is much less likely.
And risking $1M for such an attack also adds to it being a high risk for the attacker. 
Bear in mind it would only affect coins transacted during the attack.

Great post +all namecoins

1. Buy BTC because you are supporting a real and viable competitor to banks, banks have a monopoly on money (holding it, creating it and sending it around), a bank is the middle man holding you money why do you need a middle man?
2. It's not only about anonymity from banks it's about trust, you trust the bank with your wealth, I am not saying move all your funds but with BTC you have options.
3. Mainstream, that's a matter of time I would think.
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:39:39
True, however its quite easy to create services that will "know" immediately if your newly received coins are stolen, a quick search on the blockchain with a known "bad addresses" list.

Ha awesome...

Why is windows not a serious platform for bitcoin please elaborate on that.
C# is a powerful language and (with some twiks) can also be run on different platforms not to mention there are a lot of c# devs out there.  
NBitcoin is an awesome library.
@_date: 2016-03-15 11:57:48
Good point thnaks

Excellent post (although I slightly disagree on the altcoin comment) with all his contribution to bitcoin Mike kind of lost the credit with this drama.  
If you don't believe in it any more just walk away.

Regulation is not necessarily a bad thing, regulating services around bitcoin is actually good, if mt.Gox was regulated they would never lose so much of there clients money.

Hi, please do your research before commenting.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:07:07
What "obvious reasons"? (I am a programmer and have deployed quite a lot of systems to production environments) do you refer to security? on all windows version? normally c# devs will be deving on/for windows platforms (win server mostly, for web or api)
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:16:34
Ha.. I totally agree on that MS had some really bad products. However they seem to be improving their stack with azure which actually supports plenty of other platforms (node, hadup ubuntu etc..) and is now opensource-ish.  
Though I would disagree on the user base appeal, our goal (and I am a big bitcoin fan) after all is to increase adoption of bitcoin and I think that porting it to other platforms is part of the that effort.  
Having said that I am doing more ubuntu stuff lately and loving it.

I agree multisig does add complexity to an already complex concept of a regular address, this is a bit hard for the average person to grasp.

You got this all wrong I am afraid, Stratis is not attempting at "hijacking" anything, or pretending to replace the solid (proven in production) core implementation.  
Rather offer Bitcoin/Blockchain tools in C the full node is a POC of the C# implementation.

This is an excellent explanation on the concerns about increasing the limit.  
Initially I was a believer in bigger blocks but the Blockchain size is an issue in bitcoin that will eventually become a big problem, keeping the block size small comes with drawbacks but the alternative may be worth.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 09:49:14
Great I love it thanks, would sure like to get more of this.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:07:42
I really think stratis has lots of potential

I'd say nothing until LN and sidechains materialise.  
In fact there are already many sidechains to pick from, all altcoins.

Interesting points you made there.  


&amp;nbsp;  
Would that not mean your coins on the non HF chain be still associated to your address (they would not be included in a block unless broadcast also to none HF chain nodes) in a sense your property was not violated on the old chain.

@_date: 2016-02-09 10:12:14
Really great project.  
I have to ask though what you mean by "very busy"  


Blocks are almost at max capacity (empty blocks pull the averages down).
@_date: 2016-02-25 10:04:08
What you could do is hash some private details about yourself for a whole week (sounds like a long time TBH) and from the payload create a brainwallet, in that case if you forget your random sentence you can always wait a week to recover it (from your private details).  
A week is a long time to crack your details, what if you forget your initial details and need to do some guess work, I'd say a few hours is enough.  
&amp;nbsp;  
There are other ways though, [coinvault.io]( for example will give you a backup of your encrypted wallet using your wallet password but your password is also encrypted with their master key so if you forget the wallet password you can always recover it with their help but they don't have access to your password
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:24:51
Wowoo this was great I enjoyed it very much
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:42:02
Yeah I also made it a habit at company meetings to ask "when is the company going to accept bitcoin" unfortunately I am not being taken seriously (yet).
I do  however get some support from other employees and I think its only a matter of time, just need to keep asking. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 22:33:35

To all those how dismiss other altcoins are clearly doing it because they have plenty of bitcoins and are worried of the competition.
Yes altcoins are for those who feel the boat has left for them with bitcoin and looking for alternatives I see nothing wrong in that, the bitcoin is a breaking ground technology and should be shared with all.

I agree, I truly support bitcoin but not reckless behavior.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:58:24
It is a gamble though, what if we lose the lawsuits, I'd take the peaceful innovative approach.

There are companies out there that will do all the bitcoin transaction related work where you end up with $$$ in you account not having to personally deal with even a satoshi (a 0.00000001 unit of a bit coin) 
So the question is really why should you NOT accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:41:32
Did that some month back when the big crash came and I felt a bit uncomfortable.
Be sure to explain the risks and volatility.

@_date: 2013-04-12 11:51:51
I agree on that statement "we got some work to do" I think the main problem is the average person cant easily buy bitcoin's, the one that will just use it for online shopping.
When my close environment, who are not geeks, ask me where and how to buy them I find myself realizing it's not that easy even if you just want a small amount to store in some online wallet. 
If bitcoin is to satisfy the needs of a payment coin this has to be solved.
perhaps something like gift cards that can be sold in retailers or a similar sort (like the fb credit or itunes, amazon) but then the problem is at what price (with bitcoin being so volatile) so then it has to be done online to be able to adjust the price to current market value.
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:31:52
Word of advice, diversify...  add a 2-5% of that portfolio to altcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:47:54
Great quote.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:40:58
Hi hi If you don't want to accept litecoin then don't, that's not a reason to trash it (you know also bitcoin was 99.99% speculation at some point)
What message are you sending out by trashing another crypto?
@_date: 2013-10-18 08:14:48
I would like to add that bank transfers also are technically not really reversible, when a cancellation is made and a money return is required the bank will issue a new payment returning the money, there is no way to cancel the already executed operation.
Same behavior could be implemented on an exchange I suppose.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:46:37
Nailed it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:28:34
a rather pessimistic observation I would say, although you might be right, I think Chinese people will not hurry to get ride of there bitcoins if it represents such a difference in value compare to the current situation, bitcoin will continue growing out of China and there are more exchanges popping out every day in different countries, also remember big players have invested and are investing a lot in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:02:27
I think he means force banks to take a legal stand, which can go bad.

You can still mine other coins? in my opinion cryptocurrency is growing and demand for other coins will rise with time.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:03:12
here is one.
spreading the wealth that is created by crypto currency.
bitcoin is dominated by early adopters mostly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:20:15
What is the dot come bubble, there was not one company it's a combination of companies formed together to create a graph, so it's hard to compare.
second conclusion is buy bitcoin's because the internet (which is what the bubble represents) is still around right?
 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:33:43
thank you guys it's excellent you also support litecoin.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:09:29
armm yes exactly, spreading the wealth, that's what I said nothing to do with getting rich quick.
If you want crypto currency to succeed you have to give it to the people.
The majority of bitcoins are held by a relatively small percentage of total bitcoin coin holders, not saying its a bad thing, I am one of those myself.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:55:20
ho wowoo they have plenty of options next to where I live.
thanks man...

If one thinks bitcoin is a good product and has an added value to society then buy some all the rest is speculation.
@_date: 2013-10-22 16:21:10
The fees are for the work of exchanging the btc to $
You can accept bitcoin directly with no fees, but if you want fiat money the exchange is on you.
  
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:32:45
Good point, but it's so easy to accept bitcoins the middle man market might not get the chance to grow that big.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:29:33
I disagree some what, they should have prevented the bubble in the first place, but they should also stop the exchange the moment it lost 20% in value. 
if the trend was to sell it would continue anyway after the panic.
