love it, coinbase disabled my account for the 4th time recently and i'm not going through their crappy customer service again. they are fucking nutso over there.
just gave it a go and Ill let you know how well it worked out.  Stop complaining about fees, companies have to survive also and if you want this ecosystem to flourish, pay the damn fees.
Got charged $10 on my $1000 withdrawal.
Coinbase deposits usually hit my account next day so I'll see how fast this service is.
Edit: money came in right on time.  Very good, only a $10 fee for $1000 withdrawal.  I just did another. :)  Keep up the good work Glidera!

actually, I think it's useful.  I just tried it out today and will update on if it comes through or not.  It may be a better alternative to coinbase which has crappy ass service support and has now disabled my account 4 freaking times now for no reason.

wow It would be awesome if you guys could give me more than a cookie cutter response ever 4 days on why my account randomly got closed I could believe that your service has improved.  How can your email support take 4 days to get back with you only to get cookie cutter no info email like you don't give a shit about us. Fuck you coinbase.

No, I'm a real person just like you who actually find the debit cards useful.  So go away with your personal BS.  
Can people like you not be happy unless you shit in someones cereal every day and post like you're more holy than thou?

I got one too it was fantastic until coinbase closed my account out of nowhere forcing shift to lose a customer.  I now have a bitpay card and am even more satisfied.  Plus I use glidera.io with my mycelium wallet and get the same service as coinbase with shift.

stop copy and pasting your elitist bitcoin shit on every post involving bitcoin debit cards.  
We get it, you're some sort of word nazi but fuck man sometimes shit like this is useful as fuck.  If you don't like it then don't use it.
For the rest of us regular folk, this shit is amazing.

bitpay card has no monthly/yearly fee

that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard.

coinbase closed my account for the 4th time and the shift card gone with it.  Plus the shift card has such a low purchase/atm limit.
