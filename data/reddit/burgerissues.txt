well let's see after the transactions.
He nets $(-5) and a magic coin
you net $(-1 + 5 = 4) and zero magic coin.
So there's your fucking $4. you basically profited off of him. Now he needs to sell for even higher price than $5 to make profit. It's a fucking ponzi scheme.

First 17 yo kid giving life advice and now this. I guess we have a generation of finance geniuses.

Market charts are not radio signals. You just can't expect them to follow a pattern.

how are you going to handle growing economy with fixed currency supply. there will be deflation and deflation is a nightmare for the economy.
I love how you morons want to establish a new economic system without understanding basic economics.

great analysis. such insight.

basically crypto people are good at crypto but not at economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:01:20


But I don't get it, what is the rationale behind BTC being valued so high. 
I mean if it's a currency then such price hike would cause huge deflation and there's no reason to use your currency because using it would cost a lot in the long run.
If it has store value, like gold. What is the value here other than speculation.

So you mean 100 programmers are better guarantee than sovereign nations.

seriously! my point is that you can't just go and extrapolate historical market data to predict the future. I was not even trying to find a link between tulips and crypto.

Who would pay in bitcoin if it's much more profitable to hodl.
