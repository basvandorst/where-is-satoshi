Hahaha, I knew that wouldn't be too well received here.  To top it off she's the one pooh poohing bitcoin now, along with most of my friends, who think I'm nuts.

Omg.  I Remember waaaay back when Ron Paul was the shit  and my sister was getting all into Libertarianism.  She told me about this bitcoin thing that you "mined" with your computer and then people paid you money for the numbers you found.  She said you could mine them ok with your computer, but even better with a graphics card.  I thought it seemed like a waste of money to spend $1500 on a computer to go find numbers.  This was circa 2010 and while I thought it sounded a little interesting, it didn't seem to make any sense.  Man I wish i had done a quick google search on it!  Well, neither of us got into and she eventually grew out of the Libertarianism fad.  
When the first bubble happened I was pissed at myself, but I still didn't read up on it after the price crashed.  It wasn't until 2016 bought a humble bundle that came with "Bitcoin for the Befuddled".  After reading it bitcoin finally made sense! I bought in a little bit, and while it's easy to regret not buying in more, or sooner, I'm still happy and I think there's still a toooon of room for growth.

Really?  Because they're offering the same in the opposite direction.  It's not hard to follow.   Don't trade on margin across the fork if you don't like it, no-one's forcing you.

Then why charge for it??  A kraken account is free.
