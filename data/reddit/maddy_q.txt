He conencted my wallet to the Antminer S9 mining hardware and i started investing $250...And then i got emails daily from Genesis Mining Network saying your mining is this much % complete
And then on 100% mining i got email saying i made some $16000
And then i got email to pay $300 VAT
And then when i paid, he said now i need to pay $2200 to hash it
And then another $2400 to hash it
And then $1000 for private key... then $1500 for some V5 code
All these amounts i sent to my wallet
I paid for V5 and he said it couldn't be processed in time so it was added back to my wallet ...  And then they said V5 isnt working.. i need V7 wallet
And then i again paid for the private key which was $1200
and then i paid for V7 code 3 times... which was $2500... i paid it 3 times
And everytime he said some issue came up...first issue he said we have transfigured your wallet, and now i was required to send $2000 to my wallet to withdraw my earnings...
I paid that and then again some issue came and he said this time issue is that i have multiple addresses... so he said i have removed all of them and now again i have to pay $2000
I paid it again... and then i noticed that the bitcoins i could see in the wallet were in the imported addresses as Watch Only and my default wallet has 0 btc. So i asked him abt it and he said that i need to send $2000 to my wallet and it will release the earnings from the watch only wallet to my default wallet.... so i did that
And now hes saying that since i have very high earning around $1,50,000 so amount could not be released from the watch only... and for this to release, i need to send a big amount of $5000 to my wallet... He says, he can put in  and remaining i need to put in and then it would release my earnings from the watch only to my default wallet

I have access to my wallet, its a blockchain wallet..  Watch only addresses are imported in it. Can I have private keys of those watch only addresses ?

The guy says I need to deposit $5000 to my account so that private key transaction can be triggered and the earnings from the Watch Only could be released into my default wallet.
