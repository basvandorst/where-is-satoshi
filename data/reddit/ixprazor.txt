I am new to bitcoin.  I realize a few very relevant things have happened.  But why would it hit $2,000 any time soon?  What type of data/sites should I look at to help me get a better feel for the cost (rise/fall) of bitcoin?  I am not asking you to hold my hand - a quick fact or two and website to review. It is new and confusing. Hopefully this question helps other novices like me too!

I am Very net to bitcoin.  Hits its market cap?  What does this mean, why is it relevant and how does it impact a novice like m with genuine interest in Bitcoin?  Or is this something I should be unconcerned with?  I am sure this might help other people who are afraid asking this might make them look dumb like I do now :)

Id buy it - paypal
I think you would get a really good answer here:
(Or similar forum)
It is really not a lot.  You should be fine (no need to worry about being robbed from anyone established)
 (China buys almost a billion - recent)
This was similar to what others said.  Taxes won't kill you either.  They suck of course.  However, it is nothing requiring a degree in rocket engineering.  Hope that helps a bit.

While there has been some really bad comments.  There have been a few good ones and zero hedge has had a few good write-ups this being one.....   Some is rehash other is not:
It is on a lot of "established" sites.  I realize that is not always proof of anything.
Chao Deng has never been intentionally deceptive.  I am unaware of anytime he has put his name on a story that wan unconfirmed.  
While this does not directly answer the question.  It should help.  Interesting stuff - right?
