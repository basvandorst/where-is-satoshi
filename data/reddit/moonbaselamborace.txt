In that same interview he expresses that he considers them both equally worthless, but continues to give the edge to Bitcoin because of Finite supply...
He openly states he wouldn't invest in either has he "hates" them with a passion.  So might be fair to include his full sentiment rather then quoting out of context.

I caught that too.  Essentially his thoughts: We're going to stay neutral on Bitcoin just in case the world does in deed go to hell.
