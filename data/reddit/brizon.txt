You're wrong. There have been more than one occasion where I bought coffee and used the cheapskate option in Mycelium... and got my transaction confirmed in less than five minutes. Besides, what's the risk of someone doing a double spend for such a small transaction? Larger fees aren't really required for this sort of transaction.

It just takes getting used to. If children grew up with 8 decimal currencies, I'd 100% promise you that it wouldn't be a problem within a generation. I actually rather enjoy the number of decimals, it really opens up smaller amounts of value. Why only have a penny if everything is digital?


Sure, people will struggle.. or use software that converts it for them? Most consumer Bitcoin software allows you to basically abstract BTC away by only showing USD (or other fiat). So this issue really is a non-issue in reality. Circle (the best bitcoin consumer product out there, IMHO) abstracts away Bitcoin by default.

Why hasn't governments worldwide shut down torrents? Because they cannot. Why hasn't governments worldwide shut down all darknet markets? Because they cannot. 
Please watch this video by Andreas that explains that Bitcoin as a tool of resistance that could adapt to route around ALL government censorship. That is why it would be pointless to attempt. Not only would you introduce the streisand effect, it would be basically impossible to actually censor:

You're wrong. With Apple/Android Pay/Samsung Pay, you can pay from the lock screen and your fingerprint. 5-10 seconds TOPS.


unlocking is a swipe
Bitcoin "app" open is a swipe and a click
pin is exactly 6 keystrokes
0conf is practically immediate in my experience
In my experience... all of this takes roughly 15-25 seconds without counting the 0conf which alone takes 5-10 seconds. How long does it take you to hand cash over? How long does it take you to remove a card from your pocket and slide it? 
Trust me, I'm a Bitcoin advocate, but pretending that scanning a QR code is faster than anything is utterly asinine. Something like contactless payments for Bitcoin is probably a far better idea or the idea they had for Google Glass that only required minimal confirmation to push payments through. 


Yes, because I have a lot of real world experience in Bitcoin and most all other payment methods. It is my career. My question is, did you?
@_date: 2016-08-27 23:52:32
This would pretty much insure that you have zero privacy since all of your bitcoin transactions would be linked to each other...
@_date: 2016-08-28 02:51:33


How did I know you'd respond like this? No, I don't wait the five minutes for the confirmation. The business in question subsists on 0conf and they've never had an issue. That's why I said before "what's the risk of someone doing a double spend for such a small transaction?" Since it is totally possible for me to buy coffee with a &lt;$0.01 fee and then as soon as I walk out, double spend with a $0.25 fee on a prepped device... Not super difficult and I'm practically a noob. That being said, what is the real risk of this happening? The rewards seem to outweigh the possible risks in my estimation.


Which is the fee you'd use if you were shopping online... if I wanted to purchase something on Purse, for example... this is the minimum fee to most likely get yourself into the next block. With a coffee purchase, the time it takes to get the first confirmation is *almost* irrelevant. That's why I'd be comfortable with 15-30 satoshis per byte, which equates to ~$0.02 to ~$0.03 or so. Not the zero transaction fee I used to enjoy, but basically invisible financially.


Depending on how forward thinking the merchant is, I suppose? The coffee shop that I frequent has a Square setup with an iPad anyway. All cash, credit card, and bitcoin transactions go through the same machine. So that's a bit of a moot point, in my opinion.
 Is bitcoin _actually_ the easiest method of payment available to me at that coffee shop? Probably not... cash is fast, Apple Pay/Android Pay/Samsung Pay are fairly fast, and credit cards are pretty fast. Bitcoin is getting faster but is still cumbersome. However, both the coffee shop owner and I agree on ideological terms that supercede convenience in that case.

Paying with the phone is stupidly easy. Looking at Apple Pay adoption stats isn't helpful IMHO. The real transition to contactless payments is still dragging ass. Most places don't have NFC in the US. Most people in the general population don't care about technology beyond their ability to purchase an iPhone. Most people never setup 95% of the things on their iPhone. 


In my estimation, payments ARE communications. But I'll agree using your phone to pay isn't for everyone at this juncture.

If we're keeping within the context of the TNG/DS9 timeline, people work without profit because they seek to improve themselves and no longer care about material possession. 
In my estimation, profit seems far less relevant when you have the ability to create everything you need from a replicator for no cost and get everything you need to live a happy life for absolutely nothing in exchange. We see a wide variety of people within the Federation because of this: some that are "lazy" and just enjoy the fruits of the utopia that is the Federation. Others choose to work in Starfleet and other places within the Federation to work for a system that protects the paradise that has been built up. 
The Ferengi also help us to see creatures that place profit at the center of their lives. They chase profit for profit's sake and do whatever they can to acquire wealth/profit. I'd suggest that this is not endearing in people nor was it very endearing in Ferengi.

No idea. Don't really care as that doesn't seem to relate to the discussion. 


Not in the least. Please quote where I even implied such a suggestion. I simply pointed out that the "go grab the iphone/ipad" cliche was not relevant in this specific situation and all merchant setups are not universal.


Yeah? Square machines are insanely common around where I live and I'm poor as shit, I'm certainly not going to overpriced ANYTHING. Not everyone is literally using an iPad Air with the full Square setup... some people just have an iPhone and square reader in their stores. But is this relevant? No. 


Are you actually talking to me? Did I say that OP's friend ought to do ANYTHING? I was arguing that smaller fees are viable for coffee transactions and that is basically all. BTC is not ready for everyone, everywhere. That much is OBVIOUS. I'm sorry that you think I don't realize this. 


100 Bitcoin sales would probably be a high estimate too. Unless they had more than one Bitcoin regular, I bet it would be more like 5. Don't think I don't agree with you here? I don't really get the point of you raising these points either.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:28:50


Let me remind you of this thread's topic:
"Local corner store handles ~100,000 transactions a month... you'd never guess what their fees are."
Remember now?We are discussing OP's purported bodega, that handles 100k transactions a day. So no, not a cliche, that's how bodegas work. With cash registers, not ifuckingPads.
Exactly, so why did you feel the need to go into detail into a throwaway part of my previous comment? I don't care about the iPad portion of the conversation nor the comparison between the various kind of merchant establishments. This was about your assertion about the ability of $0.03 - $0.04 fees to work in a retail setting 


Are you paying attention at all? I said if one person out of a thousand pays in bitcoin, that would amount to 100 Bitcoin transactions a month, if we are to trust OP and his "~100,000 transactions a month" claim. That's not an estimate, that's basic math.
Don't know why you have to be a dick. Yes, I understand how you got your number. I was attempting to be charitable to your position and suggest that the real life number would likely be far lower as Bitcoin adoption has not penetrated mainstream at all. I thought that was obvious as well, but I've found myself explaining myself and you still having think all sorts of backwards shit.


Again, you're pointlessly being a dick and diverting while entirely missing the point of me bringing up a coffee shop I go to.  
My point is thus:
You asserted that $0.03-$0.04 is not sufficient for use within this context and I've given you my andetocal real life experience that contradicts this. Rather than actually address the points relating to that, you talk about iPads, and divert to non-related things. Absurdly suggesting that I wait there for the five minute time it took for my confirmation to go through, as if that is a requirement totally sidetracks my only fucking point which is that low fees are sufficient in low value transactions with 0conf.

Grabbing your phone, unlocking your phone, going to your Bitcoin app, scanning the qr code, putting in the password or pin and then waiting for the 0conf... a bit slower than handing money or swiping a card. Even Apple Pay/Android Pay/Samsung Pay don't make you do the above steps...

In the most superficial ways possible I'm guessing? What about on the metric of censorship resistance? What about privacy wise? How much identity information is associated with "decent banking" transactions? How much assurance do you have that the bank will not seize your funds with bail-ins and other externalized control of your money? 
Having an "easy banking experience" without most of the pitfalls of banking itself makes bitcoin far more impressive, in my opinion. Not needing to surrender almost any information in order to pay someone online is far more impressive, in my opinion. Not having trusted parties is far more impressive than having to quietly bend over backwards for the banks with the implicit knowledge that they will one day begin fucking you.

As if the reality you espouse is the only reality and that everyone else is in a bubble, but not you, right? How naive. There is clearly a groupthink bubble on and in the crypto space in general. This is a space I've been watching for five years and people tend to live in a different version of reality within our community. So this is no different. How do we actually affirm what reality is? By claiming and yelling the loudest?
Declaring it is "probably too late" is just hyperbolic rhetoric unless you can really demonstrate a reason for these seemingly empty words.
Then pointing at Ethereum, which has a slew of its own problems to contend with, along with the missing ecosystem and marketing which Bitcoin already possesses, it just seems like a dishonest marketing message. The same dishonest marketing message that I  started getting in my mailbox shortly after Mike Hearn declared Bitcoin a "failed experiment"... 


Don't pretend you're immune from being affected by distortion fields. Just because your distortion field is different, it doesn't make your version of reality unbiased and correct.

Brian, buying on Coinbase with the fee included is sometimes only marginally cheaper than Circle and sometimes more expensive. Not to mention including a 3.75% fee compared to the 0% fee of Circle.

What do you think Patreon is? Many YouTubers were losing income due to ad blockers, so they turned to another way to get direct income from fans.

Depends on how you look at it, I guess. Personally, I see it as a payment. When Google pays you for ad clicks, are they donating money to you or making a payment for services rendered? Not exactly the same, but I think the logic sticks. 


IANAL, but it seems that in the strictest sense, the answer would be yes. Though, that only applies when you convert BTC-&gt;USD. 
That would be a nightmare though. You'd have to calculate the cost basis for each microtransaction and then calculate the capital gains after you sell it for USD. 
I think this example shows why applying capital gains to Bitcoin is a little stupid.

Digital Currency Group, an investment firm focused on bitcoin and blockchain startups, is adding investors and advisers, bringing on Western Union Co. and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
The actions, which also include an expansion of the board of the six-month-old firm, aim to strengthen the investment company as it shifts its focus from the virtual currency bitcoin to its underlying technology, blockchain.
The amount raised in the round wasn’t disclosed. In addition to money-transfer company Western Union, the firm’s new investors include HCM International Co., an investment subsidiary of Foxconn Ltd.; Gibraltar Investments, the venture arm of Prudential Financial Inc.; and OMERS Ventures, the investment arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System.
The firm had an earlier investment round, also for an undisclosed amount, that included MasterCard Inc., Bain Capital and New York Life Insurance Co.
Digital Currency Group also named two new board members: Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, and Lawrence Lenihan, who founded FirstMark Capital and now runs a firm called Resonance. Along with founder Barry Silbert, the firm now has a three-person board.
Additionally, it added Mr. Summers and bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as senior advisers.
For Western Union, the investment is a way for the company to “keep our eye on innovation,” said David Thompson, Western Union’s chief technology officer. The company has run a pilot program with the startup Ripple.
Western Union is investigating other possible uses of blockchain technology and is considering ways to invest, as well as integrate it into its own services.
Mr. Summers said he has been interested in bitcoin since 2014 and said he felt that Digital Currency’s broad focus complemented his own views.
Rather than being a refuge for libertarians or gold enthusiasts, bitcoin will continue to develop into a technology that will improve financial infrastructure.
“I am someone who believes in the capacity of technology to take out friction,” Mr. Summers said. The technology offers the potential to establish a trusted platform that will allow people to engage in exchange directly. “That’s the high purpose of finance, to facilitate exchange rather than speculate.”
Digital Currency Group was formed in October 2015 by Mr. Silbert, the former chief executive of trading platform SecondMarket. Mr. Silbert’s new firm has invested in 70 bitcoin-related companies, including Boost VC, BitPay, Circle, Coinbase, and ItBit. The firm also has three operating units, including the media and events business CoinDesk, which it acquired in January, and Grayscale Investments, which operates the publicly traded Bitcoin Investment Trust.
The pace of investment in bitcoin recently has slowed. In 2015, venture-capital investing in bitcoin and blockchain startups totaled $490 million, up from $362 million the year before, according to figures from CoinDesk.
That growth rate of 35% compared with a near-quadrupling in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, investments increased by 3% from the previous quarter.
That also reflects a broader slowdown. In the first quarter, U.S. venture investment in fintech startups fell 29% from the fourth quarter, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

I'm only generally explaining why an idea *like* this might be a good idea. There are several parts of this thing that I don't agree with but I think it is an interesting base to grow upon. 
As far as friction, you load the web browser with a little BTC, set your settings, and you're done. More than a regular web browser, to be sure, but a regular web browser doesn't pay to replace ads using Bitcoin.
It might go down like a lead balloon or it might not. People are enjoying Brave for more than the Bitcoin aspect at the moment. It doesn't suit my needs, but it's an interesting thing to have within the space.

Is there anyway you can provide supporting evidence for the latter assertion?
Let me ask you a personal question. 
If you were injured and were unable to work for an extended period, then started to receive UBI in some future hypothetical future and later recovered from your injury, would you be satisfied with the UBI you were receiving? Would you go out and try to make more? I'm guessing the answer would be yes and that people are motivated by fulfillment, not money. 
Elon Musk is pursuing incredible goals, do you think the dollars were the goal or do you think personal fulfillment was the goal?
As far as I can tell, Elon Musk plays the game that he must to pursue the things he wants. 
Talking about taking risks, how many risks can someone with no capital take? None? Give them some capital and they can start doing something more with their lives. Maybe they could do some dollar cost averaging on Bitcoin? Invest in other shitcoins and turn their life around? Why not maximize the amount of innovative doers and inventors possible?
Edit: Ultimately, I think that taxation is not the path forward for UBI, but more of volunteer charity that over a long period of time grows to a large voluntary system where as many people as possible get UBI.

* Identity must be attached to all transactions and requires an identity verification gateway, thereby opening you up to identity theft through no fault of your own.

Do you really think this addresses the actual point I put forth? Nobody in 2009 thought this would be worth two pennies in 6 years. 
But to further address your point here: market cap is an imperfect name for it, I'll agree with you. But that doesn't change the fact that the pile of nuts represent an actual level of value. I'll agree you couldn't literally pull $6.8 billion out of Bitcoin if you tried. 
Currencies do not have 'market caps' sure, they have 'money supply metrics', the USD is around $4 trillion, just like the 'market cap' for gold is roughly $6.2 trillion. It might not be a 'super useful' metric ultimately, but it does show that Bitcoin does have SOME confidence and SOME value. It shows that Bitcoin can make progress and surprise people. I'm pretty sure it already has. 
The greater point is... when/if Bitcoin is doing more than a few petabytes a year in transactions, are you going to be off complaining that Bitcoin will never be able to stand up to YB sized blockchains? Things are only impossible until they are not. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:23:27
You never stop with your nonsense, do you?
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:01:15
What does bitcoin being a company or not have to do with calculating the full value of it? You're not making any sense.
Edit: Gold is a commodity, yet the 'market cap' for it is $6.2 trillion. This is a commodity that can have a different market cap if a large surplus of gold is suddenly found. The amount of Bitcoin that exists at any one time is predictable. No coins ever disappear or are destroyed. 
So keeping a running valuation of Bitcoin based upon the amount of coins that exist and their current trading value seems like an easy way to calculate valuation. Do you have an alternative method of calculating valuation of the Bitcoin network? 
Regardless, you're still ignoring the actual point. Bitcoin has reached milestones that were thought to be previously impossible or highly unlikely. But we've reached them and we will continue to reach for the impossible. You're more than welcome to sit on the sidelines sitting on your thumbs.

If I recall, 1MB was an arbitrary limit for short term spam protection, the block size should raise, and all due diligence should be done to mitigate any centralization pressure created by making the block size larger. Improving Bitcoin's utility as a permissionless 'internet of money' should be done to scale Bitcoin to the point that it can be without impacting the underlying value of it all. This is a tight balance and should be considered very carefully.
I think having a mining pool that prefers your fee free transactions is ultimately where things like this will go and not really having a bunch of low fee or zero fee transactions weighing down the mempool.

Even if the white paper stated word for word that Bitcoin should only be used for Bitcoin and nothing else(which I'm doubtful of), that doesn't mean that it is more than opinion anyway. Your opinion of Satoshi's opinion doesn't somehow get us to something that isn't an opinion. Bitcoin is permissionless and I think that applies to usage as well. Who the hell are you to attempt to censor my use of the blockchain? Of Bitcoin?
Do you know why I invested? Because I saw the utility in censorship resistance and how Bitcoin could become the 'internet of money'... which is likely to include far more things of value than just currencies. I'm sorry to break it to you. I'm sure Satoshi will be spinning in his grave over us adding more utility to Bitcoin.

I used to work at a bank too. Banks create policies that insure that NSFs are a strong profit center -- it isn't ONLY the fault of careless or 'stupid' people. There is some serious intent to maximize these profits by setting the rules. Like taking the biggest debits out first to insure the maximum amount of NSF fees. 
Chase changed their policies from having a 5 or 6 'soft cap' of what reps could refund to having a hard cap of 2 fee reversals during a 12 month period. This made it very difficult for even legitimate bank errors to get refunded in a timley manner due to higher level managers needing to 'override' such procedures. This is fixing the rules to maximize profits.
Why do think that banks should charge NSFs anyway? Why should they be so massive? Why should the banks be so hard nosed about refunding them? It is a profit machine, so your apology for it because some people can't handle their money is just dishonest.

It is a moral issue, I'd certainly agree. But I'd say that the 'war on drugs' (addressing the US more specifically here) has nothing to do with morality. Polticians parrot morality as their basis for the 'war on drugs' but they had no moral qualms when they made marijuana or opiates illegal. They made it illegal to attempt to create a negative perception of Mexicans and Chinese. 
Moreover, when the solution involves having the highest prison population in the world and spending massive amounts of money on this for decades with no results? I'd consider that a highly immoral system if it were allowed to continue to exist.
So for me, it comes down to the moral question of -- is an oppressive government spending my tax money on preventing me from exercising personal liberty being moral or not? I'd suggest that they are being an immoral agent and an agent for active harm when they do not look at drugs on a factual basis. They use drugs as a political tool. When this happens, drugs turn into propaganda and lies become okay in the 'war on drugs'...
I do not think that society has really gotten the chance to 'collectively' vote on any of these policies in a real meaningful way. Governments have actively resisted it every step of the way with all the might they possibly can (including lies and propaganda). Drugs were already illegal when I was born and it has taken from my birth to now for weed to START to become legal. That is 33 years for reference. 
So rather than waiting another 50 years for political thought to catch up to demonstrable truth, I think the greatest thing one can do to oppose immoral laws is ignoring them. It gives others courage to do the same and resist oppressive governments. 


That's a difficult question because I do not have all of the answers. Should they be 'easily accessible'? No. Certain age limits, certain dosage, and highly regulated/taxed. The goal would be to help get those people NOT using Heroin but not force them to by using the criminal justice system. That's why by making it a health issue, it would make it so the drug users wouldn't be afraid to turn to the state for help in fear of reprisal. Heroin and meth are gross and the government should actively fight to reduce their usage. Keeping drugs criminal for the last 50 years hasn't done this, it's time to change tactics.

Never ever said drug use was a disease or any of that nonsense. Addiction is a health issue, however. It is something that medical science can address. Addiction can be a very tricky thing to escape from so I'd rather have a system that is as open and helpful as possible. Not patronizing, not condescending, not propaganda, lies, and not jail time. 


Do you think I haven't? :) I've had plenty of Heroin addicted friends over the years as well and I'm pretty sure they'd say they were glad to eventually get away from it. I'm not saying every Heroin junkie would turn to the medical establishment for help right away but having the open choice is far more moral than always looking down your nose at Heroin users.


I'd highly agree with you! Alcohol should be far more regulated, far less advertised, and not glamorized with sexual juxtapositions.

No offense to you, but I think it's absurd that you can invest in a long term investment and then give up on it after only 10 months? Get fucking real. Consider if you had entered 5 months before when it was $100 a coin and you were up. 
Or consider if you had invested a year before when it was $10 a coin? Your prattle is amusing to those who've made thousands from Bitcoin and those working their asses off to bring this to the masses in whatever abstracted way possible. This isn't some short term investment, it something that could totally change our entire global financial system. It is already serving as a means to disrupt within the banking and investment industries.
So please, think a bit longer term than 10 months when it comes to investments.

Illegal drug trading is a direct response to the fact that governments have no interest in 'allowing' society to assess the problem in any serious way. So it's not 'bad' that Silk Road exists.

This makes a lot of sense. People would have been far more forgiving if you had stated all of this upfront with a bit better laid out evidence for what you are saying. That's why I was busting your balls a bit, because I don't disagree with the assertion entirely, I just think we lack more direct evidence of the truth of the claim.
Something about makes me skeptical about almost anything on that subreddit. It has been marketing toward this certain narrative of Bitcoin being on the verge of destruction and Ethereum being the only superhero that can save us from the speculative mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies that hasn't happened yet. 
It just seems hilarious to me -- a 60 million premine altcoin's hype cycle is dominating a somewhat more boring Bitcoin hype cycle. But both are just hype cycles. Not all that much has changed since 2013 in the adoption hype cycle for BTC. While there is a lot of great ecosystem things here and on the way, we're still basically "on the verge" of massive adoption. We're all caught up in the hype bubble by living on this subreddit and then the slightly more dopamine satisfying hype bubble of Ethereum comes along...
In other words, we're putting the cart before the house. Adoption isn't really here yet, the moon isn't rushing toward us at light speed, not for BTC and certainly not for Ethereum. Ethereum doesn't have the marketing that Bitcoin has earned by being the currency of choice on Silk Road, being associated with Wikileaks, hackers, ransomeware, etc. Bitcoin is a coin of resistance against the status quo and Ethereum is... a Microsoft Azure blockchain service? Perception is everything and Bitcoin is still utterly superior in the general awareness regard. It will be adopted before others given the current marketing/ecosystem. 
Ethereum's hype bubble is at least more hollow than Bitcoin's and that is why I am almost solely holding Bitcoin.

Copyright starts when you create the work, but registration is very important if you ever wish to collect statutory damages and lawyer's fees. 


Yeah, it lets you actually collect money from a lawsuit. Before you register, you'd be limited to $10k and you'd still have to pay your own lawyer's fees. Lawyer's fees in this sort of case would likely be more than $10k+. If you register, the numbers are more like $150k AND you can collect your lawyer fee's if you wish. So this isn't a "merely", this is "makes it worth it at all"...

Do you really think they are joined at the hip though? Microsoft is a massively large brand and the fact that some people from their Azure team are partnering with Blockapps and others doesn't really show me that the overall Microsoft brand cares about ANY specific blockchains at all yet. 
The implication that Microsoft is stopping the acceptance of bitcoin is probably due to the fact that bitcoin still represents just about dick in terms of revenue. Adding Ethereum and Bitcore to their Azure gives them a way to profit from blockchains: from devs running their own servers/apps from their platform and possibly scaling to be much larger (further making Microsoft money)...
No super close tie with Ethereum is required. Making their show of force was simply a way for Microsoft to advertise where they can make the most money. Just like Microsoft including the XB1 controller with the Oculus Rift. Are Microsoft and Oculus joined at the hip? Microsoft is a strategic business that cares about money. Cryptocurrency acceptance is basically irrelevant to ALL large corporations at the moment. But giving tools to devs to construct shit? The same reason why IBM's Bluemix is doing Ethereum and Bitcoin experiments. They want devs on their platforms.

Regarding prior users: 




A prior user can defeat the presumption, however, for any territory in which it can show that it (1) used the mark prior to the registrant’s date of filing and (2) acquired common law rights as a result of its use of the mark prior to the registrant’s use in that territory. Some decisions recognize that the preempted territory also includes the prior user’s “zone of natural expansion.” Because registration acts as nationwide constructive notice of use of the mark under Section 22, the prior user can establish rights only in those territories in which it was operating prior to the registration date.
Notably, the prior user’s territory is not frozen as of the earlier “constructive use” date of the filing of the application under Section 7(c), which by its terms does not establish automatic nationwide priority against a party who began use (or applied for a registration) of the mark prior to the registrant’s application date. If the prior user’s priority is based on the fact that it applied for a registration of the mark prior to the registrant’s application date, the prior user is entitled to nationwide priority (assuming it is otherwise entitled to a registration).
In addition, regardless of the territorial scope of the prior user’s rights, an unregistered prior user can oppose a junior user’s application for registration and can petition to cancel a junior user’s registration within five years of the date of registration. If such an opposition or petition is successful, and if the successful party has not filed an application to register its mark, the parties’ respective rights will be based solely on their common law rights, based on the priority in which they established their use of the mark in specific territories."

Using Bitcoin is spending Bitcoin. Your semantics are useless. You do have the option to spend Bitcoin here, regardless of your limited definition of what 'spending Bitcoin' means. Shift as a business is the one spending the USD for you, this is true, but that doesn't somehow diminish the fact that less BTC exists within my account.. ergo, I spent them. 


PRECISELY THE POINT. The merchant does not care about this magical internet currency yet. Trying to pretend that we can convince them right this moment is laughable in reality. So I'd rather have a workaround that is the next best thing, while we can. Again.. THIS IS A PRACTICAL THING BECAUSE WE DON'T ALREADY HAVE A CLOSED LOOP ECONOMY. This is tiresome.


Nor should they? You are really overestimating what this is. This is simply a tool in the toolbox that has value and meaning to some. 
Yes, they're planning on adding extra fees on top later and that isn't really that great of a move, which will probably result in me never using Shift unless it's for an emergency. Which is fine. A tool is a tool regardless. An option is an option, regardless of your narrow definition of 'spending Bitcoin'.


Coinbase is a business on top of Bitcoin offering a service so yes, they are trying to support a service that uses its service to create a novel workaround for Bitcoin usage in the real world. Shift is a company making money only off of interchange fees currently and a transaction fee later. Visa is getting basically nothing from this as it represents a pittance in their overall revenue. So this statement is just a bit silly within context.

There IS in fact an option here to spend Bitcoin using a VISA card. Just because you have some philosophical disagreement with using things that aren't "maximally Bitcoin" doesn't diminish the practical use of the Shift card. 
People can now have a Bitcoin bank account if they want, just because you disagree with the premise, doesn't mean there is zero practical value or is somehow not an option.
Edit: The article also states that Coinbase is 'moving away from Bitcoin'... which seems false. Coinbase seems to be the only large exchange/hosted wallet that is even addressing the blocksize debate in public. 
Moreover, the Shift card is not a Coinbase product... it uses Coinbase but if you notice, they were also doing Dwolla before. Shift wants to be a card that pull its funds from multiple locations and is not directly a Bitcoin thing. It is more of a universal payment thing.

Where? Pointing out that Coinbase stands to make money from endorsing a service that uses a VISA DEBIT CARD (extra emphasis added for you) does in fact not demonstrate anything about their stance with Bitcoin. Having more third parties use their API is within their best interest, true... now can you logically demonstrate step by step because I must be a moron... How are they moving away from Bitcoin? Walk me through it. 
Like I said before... at least there could be some small argument to be made about Circle or Uphold in this sense... both have made more direct statements about literally moving away from focusing on Bitcoin.
Coinbase is not perfect and I can certainly understand people upset about their KYC/AML compliance, etc. But your specific claim is that they're moving away from Bitcoin and I've seen NO evidence of that. Just your insane ramblings without any ACTUAL demonstration beyond your opinion. 
You were even arguing with me about it even being a Bitcoin option, like you get to dictate when something is Bitcoin or not like some authoritarian figure that I need to recognize. 


More bullshit so you don't have to actually demonstrate it in a way that is more than your assertion and nonsensical argument. Give me cold hard evidence, like people from Coinbase specifically saying they're moving away from Bitcoin or ANYTHING more substantive than them trying to support their more relevant API customers.
Also a bit of an ad hominem. 


It is dishonest to say 'Coinbase is moving away from Bitcoin' without backing it up with proof. You've shown no actual evidence AT ALL and yet claim no dishonesty. I don't think you know what intellectual honesty is here friend. 
Nobody tricked me with a VISA DEBIT CARD (emphasis added for hyperbolic crazy people)... I saw the practical use in the ability to spend Bitcoin and it is my option to use it.

Shift is an American company, Coinbase is an American company too. Can you blame them for having an American slant? Shift has probably decided to limit to US only in order to keep the regulatory compliance easy. (Not even all people in the United States can get a Shift card, so perhaps that is a bit of a weakness) E-Coin gets you not only on 'loading card fees', but they also have a stupid exchange rate that previously they were rather dishonest about. They charge roughly 6% in fees the last time I checked.
Shift is pretty cheap in comparison. Basically you only pay a 1% fee for buying Bitcoin on Coinbase or zero if you buy it elsewhere. Shift is talking about adding a fee as well and that is less than desired but it would still be more cost effective than E-Coin.

That's really important for you, isn't it? This is a hack. We don't live in a closed loop Bitcoin economy do we? So my option is either just spend USD as per normal or at least make some transactions using Bitcoin on my end? There was a time recently where having the card was helpful because my usual bank account card had to be replaced. I just bought some Bitcoin and spent it using the Shift card during a price upswing.


I never represented such. Your assertion that this is somehow not spending Bitcoin or not an option to those that hold Bitcoin, which is false. Checking the Coinbase spot buy price prior to purchase isn't that difficult if it was really a concern. 


Please show me where I'm making the argument not to do this? I'm only suggesting that this is an option to spend Bitcoin. Regardless of your special snowflake opinion otherwise. 


Seems like a pretty dishonest thing to say. How the hell would you know what I understand or not? Perhaps I just simply disagree with your assertions about the nature of 'spending Bitcoin' and what an option to spend Bitcoin is where none would exist without it. 


Can you substantiate this claim beyond your bald faced assertion? Since again, they're the only company that is even addressing the biggest issue with Bitcoin right now: scalability and blocksize. For shit sake, your argument might actually make sense if you were talking about Bitreserve er.. Uphold or something.

Bitcoin is still massively larger than any other Blockchain.  It still has the most transactions by far, most trading volume by light years, an ungodly hashrate, has had a global impact, has many companies in the ecosystem, has been getting massive marketing for 5 years thanks to Silk Road, and has been actually used by people in practical ways for those 5 years. 
How is it highly predictable when people have been saying ____coin was going to replace Bitcoin for years? Litecoin was going to overtake anyday now, then Ripple, then Dogecoin, then Dash. None of these coins have actually replaced Bitcoin. Just more speculation vehicles for people to enjoy.

I think there was a pump of Ethereum right after Mike Hearn announced Bitcoin as a failed experiment... I got messages on Reddit spamming the superiority of Ethereum, got messages on Twitter from whales claiming they were pumping Ether right around the same time. Then turned into a "Ethereum is going to take over, Bitcoin is on the brink of collapse..." subreddit. It all seemed so orchestrated.
So personally, I feel like the whole thing is marketing. Some older holders of Bitcoin might be moving their currency around to take advantage of the profit opportunities with Ethereum. But they might also be dumping it back into BTC after capturing that profit, we have no real way to tell other than Ethereum dumping out to some extent.

It's both. Bitcoin hasn't reached the pinnacle of its potential today as currency but that doesn't mean it never will. Regardless, people are still using it, as an investment vehicle, a remittance vehicle,  and some other niches. Bitcoin isn't great as an everyday currency today, admitted but was the Internet a failure because it couldn't do 4K video streaming in 1995? Of course not and many would say that the Internet STILL hasn't lived up to what it could be. 
My best advice is to look at a longer timeline. Bitcoin doesn't need to be currency right now because it is still an experiment. Everything else in this space is an experiment. Real world experiment that might be THE currency someday but there is no reason to think it isn't working today in its current state.

Are you planning on keeping the Bitcoin or just cashing out to USD?
If keeping the Bitcoin, it might be worth the research and the hardware wallet that you may purchase. Not only that, but the steps you'd have to take to obfuscate the source of the funds if you ever plan to convert some of it to USD.
If you plan to dump all of it straight to USD, it'd likely cost you around $300 to dump it on something like Coinbase and you would HAVE to obfuscate the source of the funds. You'd likely be hit with a fee from a tumblr or other complicated work arounds. So if you wish to just have USD in your bank account, then just take the $600 hit and not have to worry about navigating this complicated space with such a large amount of money.

Within Star Trek, they don't care about material accumulation in the same way as we do today. Of course things are still scarce in some sense, but the average person on the Utopian Earth of the Federation doesn't need to care about base survival in the same way billions on Earth do today. 100% of all poverty is destroyed in this universe on Earth.
I'd also say that Star Trek isn't a perfect representation of what the future might be if things were to go that way. People that are writing Star Trek are still stuck in the mostly capitalistic world with material possession built in. But like I said -- Picard and Sisko don't require these items to live a happy free life. It's an extra they choose to do to indulge in material possession. Imperfect writing that allows people to identify with a distant alien future that might not look our current time at all. Capitalism didn't die in the Star Trek universe, just moved to the fringes. 
Let me quote DS9 here:
* Quark: The way I see it, Humans used to be a lot like Ferengi: greedy, acquisitive, interested only in profit. We're a constant reminder of a part of your past you'd like to forget.
* Sisko: Quark, we don't have time for this.

* Raising the blocksize with no mitigations for propagation/centralization pressure.
Raising the blocksize has centralization pressure and other issues. Why not use a pressure valve to allow far more users in the fastest amount of the time with the minimal amount of centralization pressure? This would be the second layer of LN -- but this doesn't preclude the blocksize itself increasing. It just prioritizes the method that will avoid "Bitcoin breaking" as much as possible. I'm not willing to risk something as valuable as Bitcoin with being reckless.
Settlement networks AND P2P money are not mutually exclusive. I don't see why Bitcoin couldn't be both. You seem to think the future of bitcoin is "either large blocks or SW/LN"... the truth is that both is our future.

Calling people stupid will surely convince them to see things your way.
Have you ever heard of something called practicality? People use centralized exchanges because they work, people that have been in this space for 5 years know how to get financial privacy -- we found it with Silk Road. We can find it now with mixing coins, trading for Monero, etc and can be effective way to find financial privacy. It's also an easy onramp for people to get their feet wet. Stop pretending all of this is easy for everyone and try to give people credit for using Bitcoin in _ANY_ way. 
Your absolutist advice does nothing to help anyone. You just look like an insane person no matter where you post. Don't you groc that? You're getting downvoted in Bitcoin forums for being crazy. Let that sink in.
I want Bitcoin to succeed and be a worldwide currency myself -- I just don't think pretending that the closed loop Bitcoin economy exists is useful. When it exists, all of your advice will suddenly be far more relevant. You're just 5-10 years too early.
Not only that, but if any bank is involved with Bitcoin, you consider that to be some sort of plot. I see it as them drinking the koolaid and being the architects of their own destruction. You're too short sighted to see anything more than a few inches in front of your face.

Overstated bullshit. 
Coinbase and Circle will track you via the public blockchain because they are legally required to. Between being shut down and fined a massive amount of money and complying with legalities, which do you think a company should do? You may imply conspiracy if you insist but you've yet to demonstrate that such a conspiracy is at play. 
The correct answer here is to route around the censorship using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Banks will do what banks do, what they are legally required within the US to do -- perform KYC/AML That is what Bitcoin was designed to route around. 
Nobody is forcing anyone to use "Bitcoin banks"  but one is able to use a "Bitcoin bank" to their advantage if they obfuscate the source/destination of the funds. Altcoins are pretty relevant here.

A closed loop economy in this context would be a business being 100% in Bitcoin. Customers pay in Bitcoin, employees get paid in Bitcoin, and paying suppliers in Bitcoin. Bitcoin in, Bitcoin out. 
In order to support that and be a part of it, it has to begin with that first crazy customer. Then the second, then the third. This might involve giving a discount to Bitcoin purchases. 5%?
I just think supporting this meme (Dawkins meaning of the word) of a closed loop Bitcoin economy is worth some inconvenience IMHO.

Because the actual point of contention wasn't the specific size, it was the hard fork. They were unwilling to compromise on the hard fork. 
From Core's eyes, they compromised by producing Segwit and offering a "blocksize increase". But big blockers don't see this as a compromise either since it doesn't include a hard fork.
So again -- both sides think they themselves compromised but see the other side as being unwilling to compromise because both sides have been unwilling to compromise on the actual point of contention: hard forks.
Edit: So in my view, an actual compromise would be the big blockers accepting Segwit and Core doing a hard fork at some point soon.

Neither are "for sure" but nothing is. I think the comparison between now and late 2013 is now is not a bubble at the hands of Willybot. Our current growth seems at least somewhat organic. 
Those aside, I don't think Bitcoin is going to see any "mooning"... unless there is a major catalyzing event. If that doesn't occur, there's also a possibility that Bitcoin grows over a long period of time.

In general sure... but can you point to _ANYTHING_ that would suggest that this is true in this specific case with the Winklevoss twins? 
I'd also suggest there are other reasons to open up an exchange:
* You plan on creating a Bitcoin ETF and need underlying assets to use for such an ETF.
* You need a way to set a price for your ETF as "officially" as possible.
* You seriously think that Bitcoin is going to raise in value over time and the best way to make money off of Bitcoin is to attempt to add value to the ecosystem. 
* You seriously think that Bitcoin may become a global reserve currency and wish to be at the ground floor of such an ecosystem.
Maybe I'm wrong in all of this but I pay attention to most Bitcoin related things and nothing that has come from their camp has even suggested that they have sold any sizable amount of their own coinage. I might imagine them selling some part of their holdings to get the trading started but as far as I can tell, other people are bringing liquidity to Gemini, not the Winklevoss twins themselves.

I don't. I fully support your 100% bitcoin life actually. I wish I could go there, but I cannot. I don't think you understand why I get upset at your posts. I'm not against going 100% Bitcoin or trying to attain a closed loop Bitcoin economy. Like I told you before, I'm fighting for that in my real life.

You missed my point. It took roughly 30-40 years for plastic to fully be adopted in a massive way. Checks took hundreds of years to be massively adopted. Paper money took longer still. 


Correct, this is the point I just made to you. Adoption happens faster and faster over time. It doesn't mean it has to happen in a 7 year period. This is a new technology and it is a finance technology which traditionally moves slower than all other technology. 


Like I said before, just stating someone doesn't get something based upon assumptions is useless. I -DO- get this, I know specifically that people won't adopt Bitcoin until there is a good reason for them to do so. There hasn't really been a good reason for the masses to adopt yet. Like I said before -- people get ahead of themselves. 


I'm sure that's true of most people here, sure. Suggesting that nobody else will buy in because there are early adopters? Doesn't seem to align with the realities of almost any other popular financial instrument. This is a supposition of yours that you would need to demonstrate. I'm not here to say that Bitcoin WILL necessarily have massive adoption but you're suggesting it never will. Both assertions require demonstration to be taken seriously.


This is your own personal opinion and I do not see the factual basis for this. Bitcoin was popular with drugs because it allowed to bypass censorship. People buying weed aren't addicts, people buying prescriptions they couldn't get cheaply in real life aren't addicts, there may be some element of that but asserting that it is all 100% addiction is baseless. 
The same is true for gambling. I've gambled using Bitcoin because it is illegal and it was amusing to bypass arbitrary laws. Am I an addict? Are most people gambling addicts? No, only a small percentage of people would fall under this label. So it is dishonest to assign that label to everyone. 
The point is: people should be free to take drugs if they so desire, they should be free to gamble if they so desire, this is called personal liberty and you may not consider this to be a good thing, but I do. 


Please demonstrate that anyone is purposefully trying to do this. Right now, you're just overreaching and making apparently false assertions with no evidence. Just inferences.
I'd say that the real coercion that will get people to adopt will be the coercion of the state -- they'll attempt to steal wealth in some massive way and try to coerce people to give up their freedoms. People will resist with things like Bitcoin. 


I'd assert the person that carelessly states "you don't get it" is probably the one that doesn't get it. While this sub may be filled with delusional Bitcoin owners and I will certainly admit to having fallen under such a description at one time, it isn't true of everyone. It may be a wealth transfer mechanism in some sense, but what economy is not? Things aren't perfect, but I do not think the current state of things will necessarily be the future state of things.


You don't know what risks I take. You don't know what risks I took previously. But you also don't know how much money I've given away, how much I've tried to create wealth and value for others. Your method of assuming things about others you do not know is useless, my friend. Would you consider trying to having a two way conversation where we talk to each other instead of talking AT each other?
All of this stuff has very little to do with my previous comment. My point was that something can still disrupt the entire planet and still take decades to get there. _IF_ Bitcoin were to be the disruptive thing for finance like the internet was a disruptive thing for communications, how fast should that happen for it to qualify as a disruptive technology? Paper money took hundreds of years to be massively adopted but was disruptive. Time it takes to disrupt has little bearing on if it's disruptive at all or not.

Here are few choices:
* [Mycelium]( -- tends to be the wallet of choice around here, updated constantly and lots of advanced features including hardware wallets and fiat currency locks.
* [Bitpay]( -- Which is a version of [Copay]( for newbies, Bitpay's new flagship wallet product. Great for multisig setups. 
* [Samourai]( -- Great privacy Bitcoin wallet. Dev tends to focus on privacy as  priority. In process of adding coin mixing.
* [Jaxx]( -- A Bitcoin wallet that also supports various altcoins. Cross platform but tends to be very slow compared to native Android wallets. 
Others that are popular but I don't personally use or recommend very much: 
* [Airbitz](
* [Breadwallet](
* [Bitcoin Wallet](

It's more likely that their model of Bitcoin buying and selling was losing them money massively. Debit card transactions are probably not free for Circle and they didn't have a huge profit margin in exchange rate. It was a massive loss leader that they have now stopped.

Even I think you're right _in some way_ but the ways that you're wrong and unreasonable prevent from your voice being a more accepted one. If you took a step back and tried to see how Bitcoin debit cards can actually benefit the community -- you'd be listened to a lot more. 
The less you make baseless claims about Coinbase, Circle, etc being banker's plots the more you'll be able to have real discussions. Not just you yelling into the abyss.

Circle is a good way to cash out those payments, but you'd likely want to use another wallet to actually collect the money first. What operating system would you want to do this on? 
Edit: My advice is to go ahead and get a Circle wallet, but never give the BTC address out of this wallet... if anyone else is using Circle to send you the money, they may see the name on the account. The best way to avoid this is to have a standalone wallet... something like Mycelium or Copay to easily give people addresses to collect bitcoin, then send those payments to Circle in order to cash out to your bank account.
Get these people wanting to buy stuff or tip your girlfriend to buy Bitcoin and send it to you. If they don't want to... then we can't help you here.

Please copy paste where I said I was against anything other than your shitty attitude. I personally do not see the use case in using these but I have no problem in anyone else using them if they can work for them. I looked at "coinbills.com" since I am in the US and they have 10-15% fees for using the service. Why am I spending $100-$150 per $1000 for the luxury of paying my bills with fiat using Bitcoin? I don't see this as being useful. This is ass backwards. 
Using a card with zero upfront fees with a small exchange rate difference isn't that huge of a sacrifice in my opinion. The person can still be paying from their multisig wallet to the card and be able to purchase something within minutes. Never keeping extra fiat on the card. All private keys are not held by bitpay or banks. What is the actual issue other than your asserted "the banks want you to use plastic!!!!!!1111one" hyperbole you spread around?

Probably more of the latter.  My previous comment should have addressed the fact that Visa is a brand. It can shift to whatever makes sense in the marketplace. If Bitcoin were to become the dominate within the payment space, Visa would adapt and create some kind of viable Bitcoin product to service the new reality that exists. 
But yes, I think the easiest way to 'adapt' to Bitcoin would be for Visa to simply allow transactions in Bitcoin. Would they be able to get away with having a 2.75% + $0.25 fee (or similar) on Bitcoin transactions? I doubt it. They'd probably have to deliver added value to their product in some way that gives more value to the Bitcoin transactions. Perhaps they actually add fraud protection to Bitcoin transactions? This might to be valuable to some people and people may tolerate a higher fee? Who knows.

I think he's addressing your seeming misunderstanding of the philosophy of Bitcoin. You're expecting Bitcoin to have fraud protection built in? It's like expecting the HTTP protocol to have video streaming capability built in. The base technology should not have extra nonsense that can be layered on top by companies that come later. 
Keep in mind that there is no 'free' fraud protection. That is the conceit here, they make money through fees and higher interest rates to be able to cover the costs of chargebacks/eating charges when they can't actually chargeback. 
What advantage is there to Bitcoin over credit cards? I don't have to have good credit to get Bitcoin. I don't have to ask permission to use and spend Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a freer way to move money around. It may not be a perfect consumer product at the moment, but this space is still in its infancy. We haven't seen anything yet.

I've had a full node for the majority of Bitcoin's life up until 2015 when it seemed to be an encumbrance. After this whole poltical uproar, I thought the only thing to do was to reinstall a full node to help in whatever meager way I could but my experience was basically hell in my attempt to accomplish my task. 
I'm not an expert or a professional at this but I've been messing around with this stuff since 2011. But I've had difficulty syncing the blockchain on Windows on two different computers and troubleshooting bore little fruit.
I'm a lonely nerd that is willing to spend all night trying to make this work, but many of my friends would never give a shit about anything enough to work through endless troubleshooting steps to get around the issue. My less technical friends are not going to use a Linux VM to get around whatever Windows issue I was running into. 
Though conversely, I do like some of the things in 0.12 to help make the footprint manageable and whatnot but that initial sync is still intimidating for the non-savvy.

I figured you'd answer like this. But you apparently didn't read the actual question.


Was your response and my response to this was:


You responded by writing about their first public project and not any of the other internal projects they're doing. Please cite those internal projects so we can KNOW that 'literally everything they're doing' can be done better in existing software/hardware. You're just speculating on the CV1 based upon the DK1, it is a waste of time.
Without the mining chip, how exactly do they intend to solve the issue of no fee microtransactions never being able to propagate in the current state of the Bitcoin network?
Again -- this has nothing to do with making mining profits. By the time they launched in the summer of 2013, the hashrate was already skyrocketing. By the end of 2013, it was already almost impossible to RoI with a consumer miner that might have cost $400. You had to spend THOUSANDS in order to get the GHS cheap enough to RoI and it probably still never showed an actual return if you got them in Jan 2014. 


How would you be able to know this at all? Again, you're pointing at the DK1 and the lack of positional tracking as an indication that the consumer release will be the same. You're speculating and assuming. Who cares about your personal speculation? Either this is a useful dev kit or its not. Nobody is saying "Why aren't I making money from this?!"
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:12:59
Such silliness.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:57:32
This is is because the fee isn't based on the amount of money you're sending (the sort of logic that banks helped to instill) but rather just a transaction at all(specifically its charged by the byte size of the transaction). Each transaction needs blockspace. Blockspace isn't 100% perfectly plentiful at this point. Hence we have some small form of fee market. Usually the standard fee ($0.02-$0.06 lately) is enough to get included in the next block.
For sending your friend a $1 or more... you can manually reduce your fee in some wallets to be closer to $0.01 but zero? I haven't done a zero fee transaction in a long time.
Microtransactions are likely to be saved on Bitcoin through other novel additions to the ecosystem.
For example, 21 Inc is basically making a mining network for microtransactions as to get around that whole 'fee' thing by having their own transactions go into the blocks they mine. 
Lighting network, payment channels, etc are also other ideas on how to make microtransactions work.
Microtransactions aren't dead, they're just in limbo while Bitcoin scales and fixes itself.

Examine your own last few comments, it's pretty clear you're projecting. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:36:51
Typically, the amount you send does not relate to the fee. So you could send $100,000 and pay the same $0.02 fee. Though, in Mycelium, it does give you an option to change your fee to 'economical' before sending it out.

You're attacking a dev device for not being profitable. This isn't their actual product yet. When Oculus released the DK1 and the DK2, those weren't supposed to be the final incarnation of the product. 
The idea is to propagate mining to IoT and mobile devices. This chip is the first step of that. Your complaints about it not being personally profitable are absurd. The same kind of nonsense "Why didn't they just give you 2 BTC instead of dust forever?" 
Why didn't Oculus just give you 90 FPS and 4K on each eye with the DK1? 
Your expectations are silly.


Please cite everything they're doing and then cite existing hardware/software that does all of this in a trustless manner. 
Don't worry, I'll wait. 


Yes, the DK1 is a failure and Oculus will never produce a capable virtual reality headset. Might as well move onto other things... like Google Cardboard?

Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin could make the banking world nimbler based upon the current level of scaling so I'm not sure of the relevance of your response.
We are talking about blockchains being able to make things like ACH obsolete, not about Bitcoin taking on all ACH transactions tomorrow. 
ACH takes 3-5 days to settle a transaction, Bitcoin takes 0-3 hours for full settlement. Bitcoin is actually faster. I'm sorry Bitcoin hasn't scaled to handle 22 billion transactions per year yet but that also wasn't a relevant point to this discussion. Read OP again. BLOCKCHAINS, not BITCOIN.

Your point is plainly obvious in its meaning.  I just find fault with the implication of the word evil here.  Please demonstrate intent to defraud and not just incompetence. I've experienced all kinds of bullshit from Coinbase but it seems to stem from generally shitty management and not a specific evil directive to steal money. 
I'm suggesting to be more factual with what you say and not rely on positive assertions of intent that you can't demonstrate. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 03:28:55
Coinbase is cheaper and allows $1000 instant buys if you're verified. 
Circle is more simplistic and is great for getting new people into bitcoin because it is such a good money transfer app. Instant purchases from debit cards are immediate. You can get a $3000 a week limit with usage. You can have it setup so you can use your debit card to send bitcoin directly, no needing to keep a balance.  When you sell bitcoin, it'll take one business day to hit your bank account vs 3-4 business days with Coinbase.
So generally speaking, Coinbase gives you a better purchase price for bitcoin, it is going to be the generally slower choice. Circle is going to have more features in relation to moving your money quickly. 
Edit: So I'd say... use both. Always buy on Coinbase and sell on Circle if you need to sell. You'll generally get more for your bits that way ;)

They provide more than just the node. They provide a Trezor, a Faraday bag, membership in the Gold tier of their multisig keymaster setup as well as support. 
Keep in mind just how complicated this little device is and how expensive a support person would be. They've sold 1000+ of these devices. Let's assume they make $300 profit on each one (which is obviously false)... they made ~$30,000. That's less than the yearly salary of one support person. 
Take a step back and really try to understand the value prop here. If you don't like it, there is Nodl, Dojo from Samourai (coming soon), Lightning in a box, or as you said, make the device yourself.

Just to note, my main way to spend fiat is a credit card. Very few of my actual transactions in real life are with Bitcoin. Don't think I'm saying that everyone should use Bitcoin in place of credit cards tomorrow. I'd say use everything at your disposal as effectively as possible. Bitcoin is great for Purse.io transactions and nerdy tech experiments in my own life. It's also been the most effective way for me to save in my entire existence. 
But my general philosophy on this point is: I don't want a fraud protection system that employs thousands of people because the cost of that business will necessarily be pushed to me. If I take responsibility in my own risk management -- the actual overall costs to me are nil or very low. With the added benefit of keeping my finances actually private, not shared exhaustively with governments and third parties. Identity having to be attached to credit card transactions makes it so my information is a honeypot with as many third parties I may have purchased from in the past.
If even the federal government cannot keep private identity details from being hacked, what hope do small-medium sized merchants have? Let alone the massive ones with terrible infosec.

Sure, but did they pay attention to the actual transaction volume? Do they pay attention to what time of day they do their transaction?

No, they aren't. Fees aren't a big deal currently. But that doesn't mean that having $.25+ for average block fees will really be something to boast about in our brochure. Ultimately the use case of a store of value is hardly impacted with infrequent transactions and a generally increasing value. However, getting complacent about large fees as if it doesn't matter is hubris at its finest.

No, but they reduce the amount of transactions in total since people will be generally incentivized to keep transactions down to a minimum. When you could get by with zero transaction fees, why would you bother being conservative with your transactions?


Good thing that transactions get confirmations just fine. 
What competing solution actually has a use case today? Bitcoin's use case is not diminished by slow confirmation times. Sorry to break it to you. Store of value is not impacted because it takes hours to move money around. Again, if people want really fast confirmation times, why isn't Dogecoin the dominate blockchain? Because super fast confirmation times are only a part of what people actually want in a crypto.


What competing solution has throughput similar to what LN might offer anytime soon? 


It already has "real use cases" that actually generate real volume for Bitcoin. Store of value and censorship resistance have not been impacted by the blocksize. That's the entire point of being conservative with the blocksize and scaling in general. LN might take years to be widespread, but Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. Blocksize and scaling are not the only devolopment/network effect needed. 
Besides, how is the use case of companies using Bitcoin as an immutability ledger going to help Bitcoin? Just sounds like spam if they aren't willing to pay any transaction fees. I'm looking at REAL use cases, not forced use cases like trying to put all diamonds in the world on the blockchain, etc... 
What other cryptocurrency is going to be able to not only usurp Bitcoin, but also introduce transactional scaling to the point of being as useful as LN before Bitcoin can get their version propagated to the entire ecosystem? Ethereum might have a shot, but their ecosystem is still endlessly behind Bitcoin. They also lack censorship resistance IMHO.

Pretty much the same for any interaction then? While a credit card will not hold you liable for any fraud that a merchant may perpetuate, that cost is charged to the consumer in the end. Credit card companies don't eat fraud without trying to recoup the loss.
So the main message here: you have to make sure your merchant is trustable to keep fraud costs down regardless if you have a credit card or are using Bitcoin. Bitcoin already has multisig escrow and other avenues available to take the place of credit card fraud protection.

Some of the greater advantages of cash are inherent in Bitcoin. It's not some grand assertion that I demonstrated in my peer review journal, it's just my opinion. You're welcome to show where it is a wrongheaded opinion to hold. 
Yes, I'm aware that generally nobody uses Bitcoin in real life and Japan is not that much different. However, my real point was more to do with long term usage, not usage today or yesterday. A society already used to taking care of its own money and being highly technological makes Japan more likely (in my opinion) compared to other nations to have a higher adoption of Bitcoin. I'll admit that the adoption might never come, but that wasn't really the point I was addressing. 
More than that... my point was that in order for adoption to happen at all... the Bitcoin options have to be available to people. Talking down on an idea because of limited possible use TODAY in no way addresses if this is used in five years.

You're acting as though the masses are beating down the cryptocurrency door wanting to adopt just a single crypto. This doesn't seem to be the case. We're all still living in our little bubble where we think everyone is going to adopt tomorrow. This isn't going to happen. You're sitting here in 1992 suggesting that if we can't scale to 4K video on the internet next week, then some other version of the internet or TCP/IP will take over!!!!1one 
The "waiting 6 hours" chestnut is due to : people not knowing what fee to pay or having faulty wallet software. I've sent one penny fee transactions and had them confirm in minutes as recently as last week. Again, if this was *really* a huge issue, why isn't everyone just using Litecoin or Dogecoin? Their confirmation times are far less.
No other crypto is going to magically gain more network effect without having a stronger use case than Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has real use cases: store of value and censorship resistance that is superior to ALL other cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that things like Silk Road and Mt Gox helped to solidify the Bitcoin brand in the minds of the masses. You're going to have to start from scratch if another crypto were to take over and the ONLY way that will happen if a cryptocurrency comes along that is more useful than Bitcoin. Then I'd ask, what would prevent Bitcoin from just assimilating that innovation?
Edit: 


Pump and dumps are common in this space. There are just more popular speculative investments at the moment but tell me... how many of these cryptos taking some market share have actual real use cases instead of endless hype?

On-chain scaling -does- make sense. Both on chain and off chain scaling are on the road map, as far as I understand. Not only would I say in the short term but most likely in the long term as well. There is no one golden key or perfect way. Both avenues allow for different ways to help scale Bitcoin over longer periods of time. 
Having *some* fees is not the same as the fees steadily increasing overtime to be something like $0.25 or $1 or more. Creating as much downward fee pressure as possible is preferable. Introducing hard scarcity (of blocksize space) for the sake of introducing hard scarcity is foolish, we should be more inclined to subsidize transactions for as long as possible in order to make adoption as likely as possible.

There are two things I typically look at if I am going to do a transaction. The 21.co bitcoin fees site you linked to previously and  to check various stats. Including the time since the last block, general transaction volume, and see where the mempool is at currently. 
If you want to look at what I look at (if you've never been to this website): go down to recent mempool, set the time to 7 days, and then put in TX count. This gives you a way to roughly estimate when the quietest times are likely to be. Again, it is rough and can change depending on other various factors. But it has apparently served me well.

I honestly do not care what some subset think about drug dealers.  Drug dealers, as such,  wouldn't exist without governments keeping drugs criminalized. At a minimum, drugs should be considered a health issue.  Not a criminal justice issue. I am 100% for resisting the war on drugs by ignoring all laws related to such.  They serve no usual purpose other than to support decades old poltical agenda and serve as a platform for politicians to be "tough on crime" and "why won't SOMEONE think of the children???" Taking advantage of rubes who take that sort of rhetoric seriously.
Thus, Bitcoin has a purpose to resist laws and I'm sorry you don't see the value in it. "Only criminals use Tor, only criminals use Bitcoin,  only criminals use VPNs, only criminals use BitTorrent. " 


It some sense, it is. But you don't seem to very interested in nuance.  "Bitcoin isn't practical or useful unless it can be perfectly better than anything currently.  I don't care about censorship resistance because I've never had a poltical reason to care."  Good for you. I don't really care to prove to you that Bitcoin is better money if you ignore it's central strength as being irrelevant. We don't get anywhere. 


Can you point to anyone suggesting that we are using a definitive timeline in comparison to the Internet? It's a fucking analogy to say it's a fucking young technology and is in the hardest to disrupt industries I could possibly imagine. If different people make different analogies and the years don't line up... Is that a big issue for you? Personally I'd ignore the years being quoted and think about why I am referencing. Answer the question: Was the Internet ready to compete with the USPS, newspapers, and cable television in 1992?

Yes, but just because that website says something, it doesn't mean that's how things work in practice. So stating that fees are free is false but stating fees are $0.23 to get into the next block is also false. (exaggeration)
My response here isn't about pitching Bitcoin as being affordable -- it may not be depending on the use case, but in my own anecdotal evidence -- $0.01 is a practical transaction fee. Perhaps not 100% of the time and it may stop being that way. But my fees tend to be $0.01-$0.03 unless I really super need it right that second and in that case, I'll throw $0.25 down... but that's hardly ever and only for "emergency" movements.

Why would the US Govt. commit economic suicide by turning off the internet? How likely do you find that to be? How many millions or billions would be lost if US companies were not online internationally for some extended period of time? 
It just seems cartoonish to imagine that there would be overt attacks on Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be attacked from the inside, not the outside. Bring too much attention to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and suffer as your ability to control the population is significantly reduced. 


That's not proof, that's complete inference. Not saying this is impossible, but you're going to need to bring a little bit more positive evidence other than your god of the gaps argument-esque argument.

Says you. Your hyperbolic rhetoric doesn't really convince me. A plastic card loaded with fiat that allows me to spend Bitcoin through an intermediary (WHICH YOU DO FOR YOUR ONLINE PAYMENTS, DO YOU NOT?) which is an imperfect solution when compared with Bitcoin global reserve currency status. You can pretend that you're paying your online bills with Bitcoin but you're still sending them fiat and "continuing the agony of fiat"... 
You're a hypocrite that still decides to double down even when they've shown to be a hypocrite. You use online bill payments that use Bitcoin because it is a practical way for you spend your Bitcoin effectively even though it involves fiat and banking on the other side. Just like the plastic cards in question. Stop pretending you're so magically different from everyone else. The Bitcoin closed loop economy doesn't exist, so fiat banking is still involved with most of the ecosystem of Bitcoin, regardless of your viewpoint.

I'm sure people didn't care about net neutrality on the internet in the 90s either, but I assure you that it matters in the "real world" regardless of if people care about it. 


Do you know when they'll care about censorship resistance? When all money is digital and the government has the ability to freeze/hold all of your money without recourse. You might not have a problem with that, but quick money transfers pales in comparison in actually having full control of my money. 
Moreover, while Bitcoin isn't the fastest possible way to pay someone, you ignore all the disadvantages to each of the examples you listed before as if Bitcoin is the only one with negatives and specific use cases. 


Fast transactions, bills can be counterfeit, which requires more due diligence to insure validity (Bitcoin has no such issue). Value can be inflated away by central banks. Easy to steal. Hard to store large amounts. 


Bartering is something I really like in certain circumstances since it's not an externally controlled system. It is usually a direct trade of goods or services. I've traded my services for other services before. This is great, but probably not a direct competitor to Bitcoin.


While altcoins may have faster confirmation times, they have less security, but as you said.. you don't care about censorship resistance, so you probably don't care about robust security either. Bitcoin still has the biggest reach, merchant penetration, and size of ecosystem.


Can be lost, stolen, faked or have the bank freeze the funds. This is fiat on the money order, so it is still vulnerable to central banks inflating away the value. 


Might be something different in AUS, but in the USA -- we have ACHs. They take 3-5 days (not counting weekends) and tend to be the only choice for bank to bank transfers. 
All of these have some specific advantages and use cases. The same could be said for Bitcoin, it isn't some magical panacea, but if you value having actual control of your money, of your abstracted value, then Bitcoin is relevant. The internet didn't have 4K video in 1992 and couldn't compete with cable channels, why do you expect a seven year old decentralized currency bootstrapped out of nowhere to be able to compete with the biggest gatekeepers in the world, right out of the gate?

It is more that I do not think there is an actual basis for ownership and property beyond a Human's deceleration/desire to fight for it. What one might call 'ultimately real' as seen through a universal scope.
By honestly acknowledging that we are choosing to live within a social construct that has some negative repercussions on the face of the planet Earth and all the life contained therein can we really begin to address the issues with the social construct of ownership/property.


I think it is intellectual honestly to point out that ownership and property are bullshit. They are things we want so we declare them ours with no actual basis in reality other than what we can psychically enforce with brute force. 


How am I defying it? I still have property that I value but I must acknowledge that the basis of my ownership claim is nonsense. I'm a product of the culture of materialism and ownership. But I do not agree with it overall. Personal ownership is silly and pointless. But since the entire fucking planet is Rome, might as well do as Romans do.

Because he claimed that the device would never get any ROI. That is an assertion that rests upon the premise that Bitcoin's price will stay where it is currently at. I made no statements about the efficiency of mining vs outright purchase of Bitcoin. 
While I mine, I don't do it for investment.. I do it for supporting the network and helping however I can to make it less centralized.
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:28:22
Because Bitcoin being used on hosted wallets is still better than using digital fiat.
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:08:57
In all practicality, they could still sell the $100 worth of Bitcoin right away if they spent 5 minutes on Google. Another 10 minutes or so for downloading Circle, putting in a debit card, and then selling the BTC to their bank account, then finally uninstalling the Bitcoin app. 
So this suggests that the issue isn't some knowledge of Bitcoin, it's likely they don't know ANYTHING about it and didn't feel like learning. This would suggest that people resisting new things 'is the problem'...
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:02:39

Yes, but we also happen to live in practical reality. I'd much sooner have banks on blockchains and speeding everything up rather than them just avoid evolving fintech industry altogether.
It would be great of banks/bankers and great card companies didn't exist.. but sadly they do. Maybe them getting a taste of blockchains will help them to realize that there is only one blockchain of any significance. Once banks directly champion Bitcoin, mainstreaming doesn't seem far away. This seems like as good of a step as any to get us to this possible end of central banking power.

People love to read into comments so much that they sometimes think there is more to a question than there really is. I'm simply addressing the statement being made. I made ZERO arguments about this being a good product or a good investment vehicle or about mining in general. I was addressing the supposition that this device could NEVER get ROI in the lifetime of its existence. Wouldn't that premise rest upon Bitcoin staying $230? Hypothetically, if Bitcoin were $10,000 a coin.. this device COULD get an ROI at some point. Not saying that's the best way to get there.

Great, where is the AOL of Bitcoin to give a solid use case for n00bs?


Because the use case is lacking. Full stop. Marketing isn't going to make Bitcoin easier to use. Marketing isn't going to be the reason people use Bitcoin. People will use Bitcoin when there is a plain obvious advantage. 
You know when we got our biggest marketing push? When the use case was blatantly obvious in regards to censorship resistance: Silk Road and Wikileaks. Who needs censorship resistance to buy coffee? Who needs censorship resistance to do P2P money transfers 99.99% of the time?
I've been using Bitcoin for five years and I've yet to see the massively relevant use case that would make adoption happen. I just haven't. Store of value is pretty esoteric for most of the mainstream population. How much did Bitpay's "Bitcoin Bowl" really help? If Bitpay had bought a Superbowl ad, how much more adoption would we get? 
Is it based upon marketing dollars being spent or actual use cases we have available at the moment?
Edit: I'll accept the answer being "both" but without a more solid use case that has broad appeal, all the marketing in the world will be ignored.

Just like before, we cannot magically appear in the closed loop Bitcoin economy where everyone has the ability to secure their own private key in any significant way. We actually live in the exact opposite. Most people cannot secure a private key without serious hand holding. Most customers I encounter in my tech job tend to need use 'I forgot password' prompts very often. These are the sort of people that practically require an 'undo button'... 
Coinbase is a practical necessity: it is there for the noobs. It is the 'Bitcoin bank' for people that are too used to banks to suddenly be 100% responsible for their finances through always having proper information security practices. Most people are idiots and are insanely lazy. It is a useful tool, it will help propel Bitcoin.
You seem to be really against things that are even slightly antithetical to Bitcoin purity only 6 years after that currency was bootstrapped out of nowhere. Coinbase, Circle, Shift, and other services where you do not own the private key are the scaffolding to the future closed loop Bitcoin economy. They are structural support to help get us to the position where eventually we can get rid of fiat and slowly move towards a culture where we champion personal ownership of private keys. Or at least some sort of multisig. Edit: They will eventually fall away or significantly change. Infosec and key security will be something we teach 5 year olds. Bitcoin and public key cryptography will no longer be that hard for the masses one day. I await that day with bated breath.

Which is possible, but in this case...OP is correct. They put one exchange rate on their front page and then when you login, it is about $5+ less per coin. Intentionally deceptive and easily demonstrable. Go try it yourself.
Currently, their front page says $286.45 per coin and logged in.. it is $279.20. So a 3% difference. If that was their ONLY fee, then it might make sense.. but they also charge you 1% to load your BTC. So that is a 4% fee from market rates to spend your BTC as fiat.

I've advanced this idea before as well. This lead to a discussion and some actual useful ideas within that space, here is my post edited a bit:
Quoting :


So it seems that developing a similar idea for blockchains would be the way to go.
A few things can be done:
1. Trustless voting Blockchains where the votes aren't just sitting plaintext in the blockchain. Only the blockchain itself can see the unencrypted votes. The blockchain trustlessly produces the final vote tally.
2. Some way to obfuscate each transaction so it is no longer traceable or directly connected to the original voter. (Zerocash, Monero?)
3. A way to verify that you did vote, but not what you actually voted for.

What they are telling you is likely correct, they probably have thousands of backlogged tickets and they are not intentionally holding you up specifically. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 03:58:53
Truly having control of something means responsibility. I'm sorry that is too much for you to handle? This isn't very difficult, despite how the 12 bulletpoints might suggest. It is almost trivially easy to setup multisig wallets nowadays. Multisig wallets amongst you and someone you trust (or amongst several devices you own) to secure bitcoin fairly effectively for almost no cost if you don't count the cost of already owning tablets and cell phones, etc.
While the learning curve may be steep in some cases, I assure you, it is worth it to understand infosec in general, even if bitcoin isn't a priority now. 
But realistically, for you being a busy guy, you could probably spend 30 minutes securing your bitcoin against most all attacks if done correctly. After that, it is just about operational security, just making sure you do things in very specific ways in regards to the bitcoin. Being the bank has some responsibility and burden, I freely admit, but reclaiming that power has value too. Just because you are too lazy to learn and secure yourself, doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile.

You're a bit over the top as usual when it comes to these things but I do agree with your specific assessment of wirex and E-Coin.  They would charge several different fees and would show different exchange rates depending on if you were logged in or not. They should not be trusted at all.

Of course, I think that the blocksize should be increased. It should have been increased already and am somewhat annoyed that it has not occurred as of now. Though I do not see it as a doomsday scenario currently. Something like dynamic blocksizes seems like the logical solution but I also think other novel approaches can help Bitcoin scale while maintaining as much decentralization as possible.
My whole argument has been that I think despite the glaring limitation that is currently in place (1MB blocks), Bitcoin is still managing to grow and become something better. Even if it's not as fast as some other political factions would prefer. 
Sometimes I'm bad at making my arguments clear, I apologize.

Do you really see positive things coming from removing the minimum wage? Have you ever worked for ~$7-8 an hour in your life? For years? It's not fun and certainly not a way to get ahead. You'll never buy a house and a car on such a wage. Unless you live with your parents. Even making double that is very difficult to get ahead, while I managed a bit of a Bitcoin savings, I'm still considered poor for my age bracket because I can't break out of entry level positions in my 30s.
My honest assessment of the removal of the minimum wage would be a race to the bottom where employers would be paying people far below the poverty line because these people are "desperate" to compete by any means necessary. So person B gets the job with no skills because they are desperate enough to be paid $4 an hour.
My honest desire to combat this is not to increase the min wage per se but is instead remove the need for people to work and institute universal basic income. While this can certainly be a forced redistribution of wealth, I'd prefer if it were a voluntary shift in attitudes. I'd want people to see the advancement of ALL people being a priority and wanting to reduce worldwide suffering to a minimum.

Hindsight is 20/20. The grand majority of people were not using the internet in the early 90s. Just like the grand majority of people do not use or care about Bitcoin now. Looking backwards knowing the improvements that came with the internet and ecosystem makes it easy to see the clear advantages. How many newspapers and cable providers were worried about the internet in 1992?
Bitcoin has clear advantages over old systems, it may not be perfect in all respects, but the clear advantages remain despite the possibly huge flaws. 


You're correct that Bitcoin's biggest use case is being a store of value but I'm sorry, that's actual real value in that. Very similar to how people treat gold. Governments control millions of tons of gold, what do they do with it? They hold it as a hedge against other financial activity. As to with Bitcoin, from my perspective as a  user of it as a currency since 2011, it has certainly been an amazing store of value.
Watching porn and finding illegal things on Usenet used to be a large part of what the internet was. Does the current state of something mean that is stuck being that way forever? I do not have the ability to predict the future, only to compare patterns and make somewhat educated guesses. 


I'm sorry that you can't see a "clear progression" but I certainly can. There is no time limit on this so called "goal" of mine. I mention the internet in 1992 as an analogy, not a literal prediction of where we are on a timeline or progression. Mentioning it was meant to show that something that the current state of something does not mean it will stay that way forever. 


I don't think mainstream adoption is imminent. It's going to be a slow drawn out process just like the internet's progression was. That's the point of mentioning the internet in the 80s or 90s. It was heavily flawed, too hard for the average person to use, filled with illegal things, and nobody used it. Sound familiar?
Even if I was saying "right now is the internet in 1992 for bitcoin", that's still years away before things start heating up. If I were to *really* guess the comparative timeline for Bitcoin, it would be more like the 80s. But that's just a guess, we could be living in the bitcoin 1970s for all I know. 


Bitcoin by itself isn't going to destroy anything. Bitcoin and things like it will make the state redundant, not destroy it. Tax evasion is a red herring in our discussion. 
Sorry, I already use bitcoin as a currency and as an investment. That's why I like it so much, it's both at the same time. It is one of the most usual financial tools I've ever used in my life. You don't have to agree, but I think sometime in the future, Bitcoin or something like it will make you eat your words.

But how would it be against the Coinbase TOS? You send Shift BTC for an external purchase that Shift pays with fiat. Unless it was against Shift's TOS, I'm not sure this is correct. 
You're talking about a dispensary opening up a Coinbase account or sending BTC from a Coinbase account directly to a dispensary wallet. Since Shift itself is not a cannabis dispensary, I think this would work.

No, I don't think state borders should exist, but that's a separate conversation. Capitalism between individuals and small groups is fine.  Capitalism between massive corporations that use the state as a means of dominating the market and destroying anything free about the free market is not. Capitalism where a small handful control an inordinate amount of wealth on an entire planet is not okay. 


Because this is a gross oversimplification for the purposes of Reddit conversation I presume? When a small handful of companies act more like de facto countries, how is it just not another form of statism? These people got here because of the desperate desire to wealth and profit... which are simply a means of control. Call a spade whatever you like, but it remains a spade. 


In my estimation, a fair amount of corporate interests own the government and owns the nation-state. Corporations cannot use force but can enshrine puppets that control militaries that can use force. We've seen this in South America where the United States would send in the CIA and the military to make it easier for various corporate interests can exploit people and resources. Individual people are ground underfoot for the small amount of people on this planet to gain some profit year over year. It is disgusting to me frankly. 


Sadly it may be difficult to give concrete examples since most oppression that may come from capitalist business comes from their government collusion and their manipulation of free markets.
 
What about the oppression of having the min wage not track the profits of the rest of the market since the 1970s? My dad was able to buy a house and a car with a minimum wage job in the 70s. I cannot do that even with a $15 hour job. It is all a joke. Our world need not be about profit, it can be about something better. Not about wealth creation, but about honest human improvement and exploration of space. Why must we be Ferengi?

Yes, I'm aware of this. Assuming I'm ignorant of this is a bit premature, I'd say. I was not addressing its technical limtiations, I was attempting to say (and perhaps I made myself unclear) that bitcoin HAS seen growth since before the start of the real blocksize debate. Can you demonstrate the blocksize and the tps REALLY being the reason that bitcoin isn't the global reserve currency yet?
I've been using bitcoin since 2011 and from my perspective the growth I've seen makes the whole VISA benchmark so laughable to me. Bitcoin doesn't need to be VISA to be useful. It's already useful and it's getting more useful every day. It's like suggesting that if I can't watch a 4K Netflix video in 1992 then the internet will never grow or be really useful. It's short sighted thinking and your conesending attitude as if I must be ignorant of the blocksize debate since I disagree with you is not very helpful, either. 


Yet we're still puttering along with two years of increased growth despite the manufacutured crisis of the blocksize debate. The internet didn't need to be capable of 4k video downloads in 1992 to grow and be useful, the same is true of Bitcoin. We don't need to have VISA throughput in order to be useful and grow.

You might as well be talking about the internet in 1992... Does the Internet still have a limited user base and limited use cases? No? What changed?

Let's say we are roughly a decade before Bitcoin (or something like it) goes mainstream...  What would Bitcoin need to look like RIGHT NOW for that to happen? Does it need to be perfect?

It is a direct comparison to how things used to be: it used to be "easy" for someone with minimum wage or thereabouts to make a decent living. This is no longer the case. This isn't the case even if you make double the minimum wage. This is where I am at. I've been struggling for a decade to get ahead and I'm nowhere close to where my dad was at the same age. 
Something has changed with the economy since the 1970s and regardless of if you disagree with minimum wage, do you agree that keeping the minimum wage stagnate hasn't really helped things either? 


UBI doesn't have to be forced. It can be a voluntary act that people do to support the greater whole. I do not see it being a productive/non-productive split..

Hardware wallet are a dedicated wallet device with hardened security properties. Examples are Trezor, Keep Key, Ledger, etc.
Something like the Trezor holds the private keys in a secure way that is hard to brute force. You access the Trezor on the computer in such a way that it makes it difficult for malware to get access to the private keys or even see your access information. 
Coins on the Trezor would survive a robbery by having the written down the backup 24 word list in a separate location and being locked down with a PIN AND password. 
If you are able to setup a multisig with at least one key on your Trezor, it would be nigh impossible to get at your Bitcoin remotely or even in the event of the robbery.
