Most likely, because fees are measured in satoshis/byte. People do not understand this, they want high prices and low fees and yet do not even understand that one implies the other. In terms of BTC fees have always been around 0.0005 BTC

There is such a thing as fee manipulation though, miners make a lot of money by pushing up average fees.

Another person who understand nothing about how fees work or the current status of them. Only parrots talking points of others who do not understand it. Fees are measured in satoshis/byte not USD and they are always changing as well. Currently fees are 50sat/byte which is about $1.

If you already have confirmations you dont need to use CPFP. If you want to sell on GDAX send your bitcoin there and sell it. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:19:41
Facts prove them wrong as usual. Litecoin is being used more than bcash. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:53:15
Even when you use CPFP you still have to wait for it to confirm. 
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:48:39
New versions do not allow custom messages. Older ones did though which is why those who havent updated are vulnerable.

Yes, CPFP is just a way of getting a tx to confirm faster with a higher fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:42:42

Why is that not good? A payment channel can enable millions of dollars worth of zero fee instant txs for indefinite time.

pretty sure 3.3.3 has always been vulnerable it just doesnt contain clickable links
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:31:33
Its not though, look at the second rectangle the 30-40 sat/byte fee area increased by only a few hundred txs and then the 40-50 sat/byte fee area is pushed up by a few thousand txs. Same thing with the third rectangle. They are pushing up fees on multiple levels but trying to hide it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:42:07
Use 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:35:05
They arent burning money because they are mining back their own low fee spam txs while raking in high fees at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:35:33
I am using the large mempool graph which reflects all the txs. 
Plus if the mempool is dropping txs why is it showing them as being added?

Wow, its sad that bcash is breeding so many uninformed users. If you [look here]( currently 55% of mining is being done by unknown entities. There is no way to know if this is one entity or many which means there is no way to know if the network is secure. This renders the entire blockchain vulnerable to attack at potentially any moment. Bitcoin Cash is not secure, its not Bitcoin, its a shit coin.

There have already been many examples of Bitcoin actively responding to attacks this year alone. First was when chinese miners refused to activate and the community responded with UASF. Just recently its happening again with new mining manufacturers like Dragonmint coming online to combat the centralization of chips in china. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:44:33
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:43:00
Our only hope then is miner decentralization. Surely the centralization of certain miners in china give them a great opportunity to mine back their own low fee txs while still pulling in some of the high fee txs as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:06:36
Feel free to make your own then.

@_date: 2017-12-26 02:09:10
Still, low fee txs are being dumped on the mempool. Why would someone dump a bunch of low fee txs at the same time with an already full mempool? Someone is trying to exacerbate the problem. As another user pointed out the mempool starts to clear right away when the spamming stops.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:59:23
not much, large centralized miners in china can mine back all of their spam txs while pushing up the median fee for everyone else. we need more mining decentralization
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:41:21
anti-competitive practices. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:27:53
Fees are not calculated in $ they are calculated in sat/byte. To speak of tx fees in terms of dollars is a misnomer, the bitcoin protocol knows nothing about USD. 
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:38:32
Why is it so hard for people to understand Bitcoin as a store of value. Are people out there transacting with gold? Just be cause its called a crypto-currency doesnt mean that is all its is used for.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:55
lol free market ? Coinbase just launched trading of BCH and disabled the ability for people to sell, they could only buy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:44:26
Its called risk/reward,  the people who were ridiculed for buying bitcoin when it was below $30 took a risk, they are now rewarded.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:53:21
It doesnt though, Bitcoin Cash routinely has over 50% of the hashing power being done by unknown parties. This means the network is not secure at all. Also Bitcoin Cash hasnt patched covert ASICboost which favors chinese miners who hold a patent on it.

How is that possible without centralized planning? Natural order is not fair. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:21:12
Yes but each fee level is pushed a little higher than the previous, its not consistent. Indicating that news txs are being added at multiple levels at once. If it was one set of txs at one fee level it would move the chart up evenly. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:41:21
No its not, its the exact opposite. Its Anarchistic. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:16:03

Actually there is about [160k nodes]( Also I would argue there are no where near hundreds of millions of bitcoin users. But that is besides the point, just because someone chooses to connect through someone elses node doesnt mean the Bitcoin network itself isnt peer2peer. By nature the network architecture works as a peer2peer system just like bittorrent does.

No evidence of this. Only salty traders who use 100x leverage that shouldnt be. Instead of learning from their mistakes they blame a boogeyman. This is why 90% of traders lose, they blame other people instead of themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:05
The problem Bitcoin has is spam txs from miners. Anyone looking at the mempool seeing 100k tx come out from no where in a day is obvious miner manipulation of fees. Unfortunately bigger blocks does not fix this problem it only makes it worse. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:40:39
Inflation is the tx fee for fiat and it is much heavier price.

People like this guy popped up right when Ross Ulbrict was arrested too, acting like the state should get the benefit of the doubt, acting like their accusations are credible. Even though the state has lied and falsified evidence countless times in the past against politically outspoken people. 
If the girl was 16 how did she get an account on that website which requires you to be 18? That right there shows either she is lying or the state is lying yet you imply that Cody is the one who we should be highly suspect of.

Dude, bitrefill is using LN right now on mainnet. FUD elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:41:51
Bitcoin is antifragile because its a decentralized network. Regular software is fragile because it can be shutdown by the whim of regulators. When Bitcoin is 'attacked' it does not go away or stop working, its adapts and then becomes stronger. Just like how bittorrent is antifragile as well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:19:28

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:33:52
Allowing miners to choose which txs they include in blocks is the problem here. Each block should be automatically filled with the highest fees. Giving miners the ability to choose which txs to mine creates this problem, centralized mining also encourages this behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:26:10
Dude... Bitmain admitted in a press release that they build asicboost into their chips and have tested it. Luckily Segwit patched covert asicboost, now btrash is the only chain that has it, which is why the chinese miners are the only ones mining it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:32
Meanwhile no one is running a full node of ETH, they are all pruned nodes. Actual ETH chain is almost 500gb while a full client install is only 60gb. Security is always the trade off with scaling.

This chart is not accurate it only shows the % of segwit of total txs. When miners spam the blockchain as they do on a regular basis now to increase fees they use old tx types. A flood of old tx types will lower the segwit %.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:49:37
What a class act you are in deception and redirection. How about you go look at how political dissidents are treated in this country despite their color or gender. They have all been treated quite equally. 
Then you go on to misdirect some more by saying that the state is not corrupt because they didnt charge Ross with the completely fabricated murder for hire charges or execute him in the town square.

The increased amount of txs from increasing blocksize in minimal when you weigh it against the amount of risk involved in a full scale hard fork.

Adam Back = Bitcoin Core? These are the pigeonhole games people are playing right now. Bitcoin Core consists of 150 devs, the fact that you are trying to make this argument is absurd. Also he is exactly right, someone will gladly pay $10 to send a tx on the worlds only immutable blockchain. If Bitcoin doesnt get used for daily txs so what, another crypto will or a layer on top of bitcoin will.

@_date: 2017-02-28 17:26:06
There is plenty of reason, the majority of the network does not want to hardfork. A softfork is backwards comptaible and therefore does not split the chain when upgraded. Why HF to 2mb when we can SF to 2-3mb?

BU changes the inner workings of the code as well by adding emergent consensus, a feature that is completely untested on a large scale. Segwit atleast allows for backwards comptaibility if people dont want to use it. With BU your are forced to upgrade.


Because the first and arguably the only real hardfork was when a bug allowed someone to create billions of bitcoins in an instant. Not everyone wants to increase the blocksize for scaling so there is no dire need to, many will revolt and not upgrade. Also the network was much smaller back then. 


I said it was being tested and it certainly is. Show me where BU's emergent consensus has been tested at all.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:12:59


It certainly does because Ver's main point was that txs are taking too long on the network and when you have a buggy wallet and block explorer txs don't work properly.

Its a good thing Core and Blockstream are working on fungability and privacy features for Bitcoin. Something far more important than endless blocksize debating. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:07:15
You have presented false or misleading information on many of your points please correct them.




The creator is the one who added the 1mb blocksize limit. Satoshi has not commented on scaling the network in 7 years and network dynamics are different today than they were back then.


Segwit optimizes transactions and fixes tx malleability, a security issue in the network that has been around for a long time. Segwit txs are not required to be used, people can still use normal bitcoin txs if they want (backwards compatibility).


Very disingenuous statement here. Blockstream employs only 5 out of the 150 Core developers.


Hardforking is not safe because it is not backwards compatible with older nodes. Softforks are preferred by technical experts because it allows for backward compatibility. Bitcoin hardforked once maybe twice in the past and it was when Bitcoin was in its infancy, this is not the case today.


Segwit does solve short term scaling, it effectively doubles the blocksize. Lightning network DOES work and is being test and worked on by multiple teams, not just core. Again you are spreading completely false information.

You could but 1000 nodes cost you money and you have no monetary incentive to create 1000 random nodes. This is why keeping nodes cheap is important.


There is no exact number but the less nodes their are the less redundancy exists in the system. Bitcoin is trustless because of redundancy.


The issue is both and consumers have access to limited amounts of both.

Not sure, but you can configure you node to use less bandwidth if need be. 
Running a full node is a lot like seeding a torrent, you are hosting parts of a file for others to download. Throttling how many people can connect to your node helps reduce how much data you are using.

Most [major wallets are ready]( and users wont have to do anything but update their wallet software. Segwit more than doubles the blocksize, this would be plenty for the time being, If its not why not hardfork after? Segwit has also been tested for a year and most nodes already support it. A hardfork is a dangerous precedent to set at the moment, especially a BU hardfork which introduces entirely new untested consensus models into the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:29:47

Because hard-forks are not conducive to maintaining network security. Segwit increase the blocksize above 2.0mb with a soft-fork. What is happening he is an attempt to destroy trust in bitcoin through BU instigators and emotional pandering.

I disagree, a hf is not backwards compatible while a sf is. If segwit is activated people dont have to use it, they can still use old tx types. If a hf happens the entire network is forced to upgrade or be pushed onto a new chain. 
Segwit actually removes vulnerabilities in the network by fixing issues such as tx malleability it has also been tested on testnet for over a year now. If you could be more specific on what vulnerabilities segwit causes that would be great.

What constitutes as being against a proposal. If a company supports Segwit does that mean they are against BU? Or does a company have to specifically denounce BU for it to count? 
You have a great website but this metric you have added is incredibly bias and misleading. For one BU is a hardfork to a new client and Segwit is a soft-fork addon to Core. A more fair comparison would be Core vs. BU. Its only adding confusion to everything, with flimsy data concerning what company supports what.

@_date: 2017-03-28 12:41:23
It is of my opinion that this blocksize crisis has been fabricated as an attempt to either gain higher fees, destabilize the network, divide the community, or force unnecessary changes to the protocol. 
Whatever it may be this is not organic adoption growth. Looks back on the mempool of the last year we see similar [floods of txs]( which lead to backlogs, which proponents of big blocks used to rally support for their contentious hard-forks. 
Stay vigilante brother and sisters, dont be so naive as to think they arent trying everything in their book to slow down or halt Bitcoin expansion. Bitcoin is what they fear it is and its only growing. Dont let people play on your emotions and greed, keep a level head.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:01:18
I see no need to HF to increase blocksize when segwit does it with a softfork. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:54:48
Because its a hard fork and the entire network does not want one. When this is the case you will certainly split Bitcoin into 2 chains. People want safe scaling methods that dont but Bitcoin as risk of becoming 2 coins. This is the main reason, there are many other reasons based on untested code and consensus mechanisms BU wishes to implement. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:07:10
This has nothing to do with blocks times. Txs still propagate the network even though they haven't been put in blocks yet. This chart is showing a flood of 45k txs on the network (not blocks) in just a few hours.

Except that any responsible party using the blockchain for large amount of txs would spread them out over time rather than dump 45k txs on the network in one afternoon.

Completely counterproductive to someone using the blockchain for useful purposes.

Why would you want backwards compatibility? 
Because Bitcoin is a consensus network! Releasing software that makes all other previous versions incompatible is exactly what we DONT want.

Great explanation! These are the intricacies that many non-technical minded people do not understand. People think, "Hey just up the blocksize and its all fixed!" Without actually understanding how the network functions. This is why its so reckless to put faith in business minded people as opposed to developers when it comes to decentralized network architecture.

No, they can never be lost. They will either end up where you sent them or they will return to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:48:36
Read the entire thread. People point out much more than the invalid block bug. 
For example:
"1) there is a quadratic hash validation function that causes larger blocks to take exponentially longer to validate. If the blocksize cap is raised, even modestly, it becomes possible for a miner to create an "attack block" that takes the network longer than 10 minutes to validate. Segwit fixes this, BU doesn't.
With the way BU works, this vulnerability could make it possible for a small group of miners to constantly push the blocksize higher. There is also an much larger likelihood of selfish mining, and a higher risk of orphaned blocks/chains. Basically the blocksize debate becomes an endless problem that is a threat to network function, with a serious tendency toward centralization."

has nothing to do with the software core releases. You're convoluted arguments are meaningless. The truth is that miners have blocked every attempt at a blocksize increase. Classic, XT, 8MB, BU, and Segwit; none of them have gained miner support. Meanwhile the community is destroying itself while miners rake in the high fees.

Bigger blocks make it cheaper to spam the network, also easier to create backlogs. The more txs that can fit in a block the cheaper the blockspace is.

It keeps miners power in check though. If miners want to get paid they have to follow majority consensus rules and right now over 90% of nodes are Core.

We cant stop people from spamming the network, all we can do is wait for them to be priced out, the network is working fine, it is not a perfect system though so please dont expect it to be.

What other implementations support EC? Also why are you not framing it as Segwit vs. EC on the nodes and blocks pages? Those pages still show Segwit vs. BU. What you are doing is creating obscurity by not being consistent with making clear distinctions between proposals and implementations.

If youre buying something like bread why does it matter? You are being ideological for no reason. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer money, it works right now. You assume that you deserve endless cheap fees for this but the network is still growing. You cannot have everything you want right now. What matters is that Bitcoin does work as peer-to-peer money and you can use it as such.

Devs have been working hard coding and testing segwit for over a year now. It addresses all the problems you have. If you want to complain, complain to the miners who are not adopting it because nodes have, businesses have, and most users want it too.

This is how Bitcoin functions fundamentally, pay the proper fee and your tx will be in the next block. If you think it is flawed build something new. For now this is the best system we have, people are trying to improve it at the moment, it does work though. Like I said you seem to think you dont owe the miners a fee who are securing the blockchain, this is false. Bitcoin is not for buying bread right now, maybe you can learn to make your own bread, that is even more empowering. However in the future development will allow for small txs. 
Also you keep quoting Satoshi but just because he made a claim doesnt mean it will work in practice. You are literally doing the equivalent of bible thumping right now.

If blocks get too big other aspects of the network suffer, including security and block propagation. Im not for any proposal that removes blocksize limit.

Here are my suggestions...
1. For the [nodes]( page you have XT, Classic, Unlimited, and Core. Yet there are many other implementations that follow Core consensus (btcd, bcoin, bitcore) that you do not include in Core percentile. So why is it relevant to highlight the 26 XT nodes at the top of the page but not any of the other implementations that follow Core consensus? I suggest having a breakdown of Core consensus nodes and alternative consensus nodes then basing your charts off of those figures. Edit: Actually to be honest BU follows core consensus as well so its really disingenuous to be listing these nodes as if they are offering anything different. 
2. On the [blocks]( page comparing Segwit to BU is a misnomer. Segwit is a scaling proposal while BU is a new implementation with a different consensus structure. I suggest making it clear to your users the different between proposals, alternative implementations, and alternative implementations that break current consensus structures. Also you title your chart "Explicit Mining Pool Support by Proposal" however, signaling is not equal to support. Many nodes and miners signal for BU but do not run BU code. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:30:10

A full node downloads the entire bitcoin blockchain (every bitcoin transaction ever made) 
The current size is just above 100gb. Core is the most stable and advanced full node. BU is a alternative implementation that is attempting to hardfork the network to introduce new rules which allows miners to control blocksize. Over the past few months BU has been found to have many bugs results in catastrophic failures of their nodes.
If you want to run a full node run Bitcoin core, the team is better and the code is better.

You are missing the point entirely. Bitcoin core wants to scale Bitcoin without the need of a hard-fork which is very dangerous and opens the network up to attack and manipulation. Core is trying to scale with segwit (soft-fork) which allows the network to remain whole while increasing block capacity and enabling layer 2 solutions which scale better than endless blocksize increases. Even if we had 1gb blocks Bitcoin couldnt scale to global use. This is a technical debate but it has turned into an emotional one.

All of these bitcoin veterans coming out of the wood work to continue to push the hard-fork narrative. What would be the point of SW+2mb hf? Segwit is a much safer method than a HF and it has the potential to put 3.7mb in blocks. A HF is the most dangerous thing we could do to Bitcoin right now.

The attacker is absolutely correct. The terms of the contract were in the public domain for everyone to see and anyone who sent ETH to that contract signed that contract.

Block propagation is important too. Bigger blocks take longer to propagate the network. If it takes a long time for new blocks to propagate the network, the network becomes susceptible to attacks and also selfish mining.
@_date: 2017-01-29 01:41:29
Because a legitimate user wouldn't suddenly dump 60k txs onto the network with low tx fees. If this was a company trying to send btc to clients what would be the reason for dumping so many txs with low fees? They would just clog the network and potentially prevent their clients from receiving the btc at all.

You are completely assuming the fee amounts people use and why they use them. Then by saying this is the average fee makes people think they need to pay 42 cents to get their tx in a block.

You cant prove covert ASICboost, thats the point that it is covert. The evidence was from bitmain delaying segwit for months while mining empty blocks.

Depends on if you send your tx with the appropriate tx fee. Right now the network is being flooded with txs without proper fees and therefore those txs are being back logged. People who are sending txs with proper fees are being confirmed within the next block.

The Bitcoin software is programmed to generate blocks every ten minutes. The miner who finds the block is awarded 12.5 bitcoin, 'created' by the software. Every 4 years the block reward halves as well. Last year it went from 25-&gt;12.5 and in 4 more years it will go from 12.5-&gt;6.25

And what do you suppose causes these 50k tx to appear over night? Miners are gaming the system because they are able to choose which txs they confirm therefore minimizing losses while increasing overall network fees. This is game theory but I do think that miners should NOT be able to choose which txs they put in blocks.

Absolute rubbish. People like you have been saying things like this for years yet Bitcoin becomes more and more adopted every day. The truth is that merchant processing companies like bitpay, coinbase, etc all depend on people using bitcoin as a high volume of transactions. They do not make money off people hodling btc. Literally their business plans fail if bitcoin is not used to buy day to day items. They know this which is why all these private businesses want to support Bitcoin as a payment network and not a store of value.

Yes I know this but the network has no regard for USD value. It is a human concept to measure bitcoins value. In terms of purely in-network sat/byte fees they are less or equal to what they have always been. Therefore it is incorrect for people to go around saying bitcoin fees are higher without showing the relation to sat/byte.
@_date: 2016-12-19 00:16:39
decentralization is the priority of the network. The higher the bandwidth costs to run a node the less decentralized Bitcoin is. This is the priority, cheap fees and buying coffee with bitcoin however is not a priority at all. The amount of risk involved in a hard fork outweighs the benefits of a 1mb increase in blocksize.

No there is no proof covert ASICBOOST was used, but thats the point hence the covert part. However, Bitmain did admit they build it into their chips and have tested it on testnet as well as owning a chinese patent on asicboost. Occam's razor says its more than likely they used asicboost on the main chain and is also why they delayed segwit for so long.

Mining 500kb blocks is not a softfork. Some miners mine empty blocks right now, it is their choice to do so. Other miners however are incentivized to mine 2mb+ blocks and claim the fees.
 An actual softfork is something like segwit, if miners had started making segwit blocks without the other nodes updating they would reject those blocks.

Block validation/propagation is not just done by miners. The entire network is checking the blocks that are produced. Adding new rules via softfork would end up having their blocks rejected by the rest of the network. If miners controlled the network they would have forced a blocksize increase considering 90% of them were for it. But since the rest of the network was against it they couldnt move forwards otherwise they would risk having their blocks rejected. 
This is not theoretical this is factual, this is how the network behaved when miners tried to control it.

This blogpost by Bitmain admits that they build ASICboost circuit designs into their chips, that the have used ASICboost on testnet, and that they own patents on ASICboost and have a legal right to use it.  
There is no way to prove Bitmain is using covert ASICboost, thats why its called covert. But the amount of evidence we have points to a high likelihood of miners using it. Bitcoin is not a network where we can assume benevolence, Bitcoin is built on competition and game theory, which means all participants will act in their best interest. In this case for miners ASICboost is in their interest which is why the only way to create a fair playing field was to implement segwit which makes covert ASICboost overt.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:43:38
Please source your claims that covert ASICboost requires super special miners that no one could ever produce at cost. 
My main point is that its better safe than sorry, segwit effectively stops covert ASICboost. This means new miners are more likely to mine BTC where they know its a level playing field. 
Its crazy everytime I bring up ASICboost people try really hard to disregard its potential impact.

A fully traceable digital currency is better for criminals than cash which by nature is practically anonymous? If anything stuff like cryptolocker will encourage people to keep proper backups and practice basic computer security.

Yes, because you can make the same argument about any tool. Hearn is confusing the tool with the person who wields the tool, then blaming the tool for the outcome. This is something politicians do quite often in order to arise emotional knee jerk reactions from people. 3D printers for instance, within 5 years they will have the potential of printing fully automatic rifles. Lets draw up a scenario about how dangerous this will be and shame 3D printers for printing.
IMHO these types of arguments are for the simple minded. These scenarios attempt to remove responsibility from the individual and place blame on tools which are inherently neutral.

No, all my node needs is the genesis block hash and the sha256 hashing algo. With that all blocks and txs my node receives can be verified locally without trusting any other nodes.
@_date: 2019-04-10 01:43:22
PoS coins suffer from a lack of risk. Those who stake have no risk in terms of a chain fork. In the event of a fork stakers will stake both chains in order to maximize profit with zero risk. In PoW miners have risk and therefore are incentivized not to act irrationally. 
Staking is also subjective consensus in the sense that new nodes that enter the network have no way of finding the correct state of the chain without a hard coded checkpoint or referencing a centralized party. In comparison with PoW a new node entering the network just checks the entire history from block 0 in order to find the correct state of the chain, hence it is objective consensus.
@_date: 2019-04-27 19:14:05
Not sure why anyone even uses Samourai. Electrum Mobile is a way better wallet.

For a new node all they need is the genesis block hash and the sha256 hashing algo. Then all other blocks can be verified independently with zero trust. This is the basis of dont trust, verify and why bitcoin is and will remain the top crypto.

@_date: 2017-04-14 00:19:18
Satoshi added the 1mb blocksize precisely because it helps stop spam. The larger the blocksize the more room for spam there is and the longer it takes for blocks to propagate. Which is a deadly combination to a decentralized network. Maybe now you are starting to get why Core has been focused on optimizing blockspace rather than carelessly increasing the blocksize.

You dont have to predict the future, we already know blocks happen on average every 10 minutes and that blocks are 1-1.3mb. We can see the average growth of the mempool in real time and we can also see the fee structure of all the txs in the mempool. Literally all you have to do is quantify that data and estimate for variance in the block time. If fees go up while you are waiting for a block simply use RBF to bump your fee before the block.

After digging down the rabbit hole this is what I have concluded. CSW knows Kleiman was the main person behind Bitcoin and since Keliman's death in 2013 CSW has been forging and fabricating evidence in order to make it looks like he is the rightful owner of any bitcoins Kleiman may have left behind. Much of it is documented in the court case the Kleiman estate has brought against CSW.  
Fortunately it doesnt matter what CSW claims, the burden of proof is on him.

**Q: Wouldn't it be better to avoid rising fees for now, to incentivize adoption? Be a bit more pragmatic?**
Decentralization is the purpose of Bitcoin and essential to its existence.
Larger blocks create centralization pressure, an observation that does not seem to be in dispute among developers. And given the current state of the ecosystem, with a handful of pools directing most of the hash power and an apparent declining number of validating users, it seems one megabyte is problematic enough.
By analogy, imagine a door lock company advertising that they have the best locks on the market. People need to be able to get through doors, and their lock makes that really easy, so that the most people possible can get through! The company considers security important ... but not at the expense of ease-of-use. Can this reasonably be described as 'pragmatic'?
If Bitcoin centralizes and succumbs to the censors, it will have nothing to offer its users.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:19:14
Because its just based on trust. Your node has no frame of reference of the network outside the hashes other nodes are telling it. This is known as subjective consensus. 
In comparison with PoW your node can check the work of the hashes it receives using PoW. This is known as objective consensus and is the big difference between PoW and all other consensus algos.

To my knowledge they are not very keen on the idea as nodes are not a great way to measure consensus. Core is about security first and foremost. They get a bad rap for moving slow but they understand the risks.
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:21:42
Did you know that big blocks just makes spamming the blockchain cheaper? We need optimized scaling, like what Core is working on.

The biggest shifts in history are always overlooked by the common people. Consider yourself aware enough to realize the opportunity, those who wish to learn will find you.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:23:50
Maybe you are the shill, Ive never seen someone get so triggered over a discussion about who might be Satoshi. 
Kleiman also wrote cryptographic software for government agencies and started computer security companies. You just seem to have a deep hatred for Wright which distorts your perspective. Also why would Wright fabricate and forge so many documents and contracts relating to Kleiman and the ownership of his bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:32:32
But how does the new node know that the hashes it receives from the network are for the correct chain? Downloading a ledger from a trusted node is subjective consensus. PoW is objective meaning a new node can sync without needing to trust any other nodes. PoS and DPoS are state chains meaning the state of the chain needs to be told to a new node as opposed to a new node objectively finding the correct state.

The mempool is all in real time, you can see how many people send new txs after you and what their fee is. All you have to do is make sure your fee is sufficient enough before then next block, if its not use RBF and bump it. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:54:44
So they are just trusting the hashes they hear are for the correct chain, again subjective consensus.

Kleiman was a computer forensics expert, started many companies centering on computer security, and created cryptography software used by various government agencies. He was also a regular contributor to the same cryptographic mailing lists Satoshi was on. He wrote many books on computer security forensics as well. 
He was plenty qualified to code Bitcoin. Where did you get the idea he was just some random IT drone?
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:47:18
Yeah they paid $4000 because they see more value in a BTC than USD, otherwise they wouldn't have bought it. They werent around in 2015 though so the difference in price is meaningless. Value is subjective.

BTC was only over $18,000 for a total of 3 days. Either you are lying or incredibly unlucky. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:13:03
Yes pretty much. Every new BTC node will reconstruct the entire history from the genesis block in order to ensure the chain they end up on is valid. This is the only other way outside of trusting a third party and since its all done through checking the proof of work it is objective and therefore verified.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:10:10
Just because someone buys bitcoin at a higher price than i did doesnt make them 'the greater fool'. It just makes them a person who is risking one asset for another in hopes of a future outcome.

Ok so someone sells their BTC for a $5000 loss but a year from now BTC is back above $10,000 and had they not sold they would have a gain. This has nothing to do with zero sum games and everything to do with subjective value and time preferences.

In sat/byte they very well may stay the same. That is exactly why measuring fees in USD makes no sense if you want an accurate measurement of network fees. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:00:22
The link you posted shows daily transaction from September - November 2017 between 200k and 350k. Current daily transactions are between 250k - 300k. This is pretty close if you ask me, especially in terms of the fee difference between then and now. 
Bitcoin price has gone through many bubble cycles, if you call bitcoin being at $4000 right now stagnated growth than you haven't looked at the history of the price. The last bubble cycle was a 2 year bear market of stagnating price. 
What is your point other than baseless conjecture about the future of the network based on incomplete assessments?

Maybe the person I bought from bought in at $1.00 though and was happy to sell their 1 bitcoin for 500x profit. Maybe the person I sell to will sell their coin for $50,000. The idea that there is 'always' a loser and always a winner is completely subjective.

Stop denominating fees in USD. Fees are dnominated in sat/byte, the Bitcoin network has no knowledge or care for what a USD is. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:53:28
Its not my arbitrary metric, its the metric the Bitcoin network uses to calculate fees.
At todays price a fee of 0.0001 is 4 cents. If bitcoin goes to $100,000 a fee of 0.0001 is $10. In terms of the network though the fee never actually changed, its only the USD value that changed. Therefore USD is the arbitrary metric, not sat/byte.

Its a completely useless and arbitrary metric to measure in USD. If the price of BTC shot up to 10k this week fees would also go up. If you measure the fees in sat/byte though you can actually gauge fees accurately.

Dude are you serious right now?
[Even the chart you posted is showing that fees in USD are just a few cents right now]( just as they always have been for the majority of Bitcoins history.
[In terms of sat/byte, back in 2011 fees were just as high as they were in late 2017.]( How do you explain this? It is because in 2011 the price of 1 BTC was a few dollars and in late 2017 the price was $20,000. Do you understand as the price of BTC goes up so do the fees in terms of USD? Fees are measured in sat/byte and when the BTC price goes up so does the price of a satoshi. If USD went into hyper-inflation tomorrow fees would be $100s of dollars in USD but still a few sat/byte in terms of BTC. This is why USD is just a arbitrary metric in terms of fees and why fees should always be measured in sat/byte! 
You absolutely have no valid point to stand on right now.
You are talking in circles with nothing but insults and false claims. 
You seem to be nothing but another Bcash devotee who was duped by a bunch of frauds and chinese miners into believing their bullshit FUD. Meanwhile BTC is still growing in usage and relevance and BCH continues to fade into its inevitable fate of obscurity.

Again I will reiterate, "For the majority of bitcoins history fees have been a few cents." 
The chart shows my claim is correct but you keep trying to cherry pick the data.
Also if we really want to debate this BTC fees are best measured in satoshis per byte not USD. When you measure fees in USD the metric is distorted by the value of a satoshi so no matter what, if the price of BTC goes up the value of a satoshi goes up and therefore fees in USD go up. Its not a valid metric in terms of network fees. 
This is why the chart I posted (  ) 
Is a more accurate measure of fees and as you can see BTC fees right now are some of the lowest they have ever been in its entire history.

Its not an either/or situation, both miners and nodes keep each other honest. Many times the network has demonstrated that nodes will not propagate invalid blocks.

Segwit already is a blocksize bump. A hardfork is even more difficult than segwit. The problem here is that people have been lied to about segwit and continue to parrot false narratives concerning it. Scaling solution is on the table ready, litecoin implemented it and they have LN txs already on the way. The only problem here are miners in china who use asicboost who refuse to activate segwit. UASF will be the solution.

Yes it is false. It is the entire Bitcoin network that must come into consensus for new rules to be added or removed. As we have seen in the past when miners create invalid blocks, nodes DO NOT propagate them because they are not in consensus with the network. 
If it was just miners who choose consensus rules what is to stop them from creating 42 million bitcoins instead of 21 million?
This idea that miners are solely in control of consensus is simply false and completely ignores the fundamental mechanism of decentralized consensus.

Now here we are and it turns out ethereum cant scale either and bitcoin is still on top with an empty mempool.

This is how political theater works as well. Politician 'A' creates inflated expectations about an issue and when those expectations are not met they blame politician 'B' for hindering progress. Politician 'A' uses smear tactics, vague arguments, and lofty promises to convince the uneducated masses that he is the person to make everything right and save them from this newly created enemy. 
This is textbook political theater, Bitcoin has actively been under attack using divide and conquer tactics for a while now, we have seen these same tactics used in politics for decades. The attacks are becoming more aggressive because those who are losing power are getting more desperate. 
Stay vigilant, call out these charlatans when you are able, educate people, show them they are the ones in power not these dishonest cult personalities.

Based on blockchain analysis its very obvious that certain addresses intentionally send bitcoins in a way to increase network load and fees.

Seems that Waves is another ICO driven, buzzword ridden racket. 


First off they don't even say which blockchain these tokens of theirs will sit on. Furthermore as soon as you start representing a secondary assets with a 'token' you have created counterparty risk. 
For example, if I create a 'token' that represents one ounce of gold, it doesn't actually represent anything but my trust in the person holding that 'token'. 
The value of bitcoins comes from the fact that they are the asset of value as well as the settlement instrument, they do not represent or abstract any other value. There have been countless attempts to create these magic tokens schemes that represent other assets and they always end up falling apart, simply because people are reintroducing counterparty risk into a system that does not need it.
I really hope Mycelium doesn't go down this route of associating with these pie in the sky types.

Dude they are engineers and have explained repeatedly why they dont want to HF for the network. Not only is it incredibly risky, but blocksize increase offers no real scaling solution. Instead they spend 2 years programming a softfork which fixes many age old problems, increases the blocksize, and preps the network for further optimization and layer 2 scaling. Its the miners who are raking in record fees right now and Jihan who is blocking segwit as long a he can to maximize profits of his asicboost.

They take a percentage from merchants. They also charge anyone who pays in BTC an extra fee even though its not needed. They have horrible fee estimation and were one of the main reasons fees shot up last year, they don't offer segwit and they show no signs of implementing LN which can solve all their exaggerated fee problems. They also use a non-standard payment URI, nothing about the way they operate is logical.

["SegWit tx is unfairly cheap" -Jihan Wu](
Its not about blocksize its about blocking segwit which patches his asicboost that garners him huge profits. You are an absolute fool to believe otherwise. 


No, we arent. Bigger blocks means more blockspace which means less fee competition. Small blocks mean more competition which equals higher fees.


Just like core doesnt block anything either, 37% of the miners want segwit, over 90% of the nodes want it and over 80% of the businesses want it. Its Jihan that has been blocking it.

Yes and an engine is not the only thing that makes a car work. You also need tires, transmission, differential, etc. All these other aspects working in unison with the engine is how a car functions. Much like the Bitcoin network needs many aspects to work together. The notion that, "only mining nodes count" is absolute rubbish.

You cant offer price stability in any currency. When you buy a new card and drive it off the lot it losses a good chunk of its value. Same thing for most other technologies, cellphones, computers, etc. Also look at some other countries with hyperinflation, their currency is not stable at all. With bitcoin the supply is known and not arbitrarily manipulated.

Market cap does not a blockchain make. ETH blockchain can no longer handle ICO influx of users. Right now the Bancor ICO has almost 5k pending txs which is delaying the entire network. Not only that, the Ethereum blockchain is increasing rapidly as well, it is approaching [200gb]( which will lead to further decentralization problems. 
People look at market cap and all they care about it money. ETH is not a perfect system, it is already in muddy waters. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:28:30
Not an expert, his segwit2x code failed miserably because of an amateurish 'off by 1' error and since the code wasnt audited if it had been run the entire network would have halted. Garzik then went on to make and support multiple shitcoins such as Bitcoin United and Veriblock.
