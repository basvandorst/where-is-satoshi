Haha. I have seen a few people use the word "normal" rather lightly. Not realising the neative conatations it carries. He probably should have used the word "average".

According to their TOC any BTC sent to them should not have been exchanged for any other currency before. Rather hard to comply, don't you think?

Mycelium Local Trader does not require you to have the funds in the wallet to create an ad. You can have the funds in a paper wallet. You only need the funds when you confirm a trade. At that point you scan the paper wallet with the Mycelium wallet.

For the last 4 months I have been using kraken.com. I have made about 10 transfers out in that time. All where processed within hours of me iniating them. Support have always been responsive, and clearly know every detail of their business. They take security very seriously. Its possible to lock your account settings/details completely, they even sign all their email and, if you provide a pgp public key, encrypt emails sent to you.
Whilst I totally trust them with my bitcoin. As best practice you should never keep your coins on an exchange for an extended period.

That makes two of us. Looks like you will only own 50%.
