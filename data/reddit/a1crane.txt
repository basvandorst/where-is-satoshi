What wouldn’t you want to mine on renewable energy? It would cost you nothing to mine at that point. Yeah the start up costs and such would be a good bit but it will eventually pay itself back. And then you’ll be making even more money. 
Carbon based electricity or the sun, wind, hydro, geothermal for free? I choose the latter.

There are already ways to store that excess energy. Hydrogen Fuel Cells. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. I’ve been reading “The Third Industrial Revolution” , New York Times best seller, by Jeremy Rifkin recently. His book talks about countries and nations putting out green plans and helping with technologies that were being developed back in 2009. Rome, Germany, and San Antonio, USA to name a few. Hydrogen fuel cells were around back then. In the book he also states that renewable energy technology gets 8% cheaper every year. So since 2019 it’s already 80% cheaper at that metric than it was 10 years ago. 
Now he also explains how the industrial way using up a bunch of land to get resources like coal and oil doesn’t need to be the case for renewable energy. The wind is always blowing, the sun is always shining somewhere in the world, water is always flowing, and geothermal energy is everywhere beneath us. He talks about how houses are going to be mini power plants connected to an “energy internet” where you can buy and sell excess electricity across it. 
I live in Alaska, in anchorage our biggest city, almost ever new house that is being constructed, apartment building, etc with solar panels. Now we are much farther north and get way less sun than other parts of the world but during the 6 to 7 months that we do where the sun is constantly above us, i.e. “midnight sun” is what it’s called over here, we can save all of that in fuel cells or the many other storage technologies. 
Us as carbon based economies and infrastructures will take some time to make it happen but it’s definitely already on its way. The third world countries is where it’s really going to take off because they don’t have the infrastructure we do. They can build it as they go, we have to back track a little bit.

Need to have programs in place teaching our younger generations about money, finance, etc. It’s never taught in schools. 
I had the opportunity to take a math for finance class in high school and it’s helped me out tremendously.
I remember my mother always telling me, “Money doesn’t grow on trees”, well in fact it actually does just not figuratively.

I used Bitcoin a couple weeks ago to fund my America’s Card Room Poker account. They use to accept credit cards and PayPal and wire transfers etc, now it’s just only bitcoin. Took like 2 mins to start playing after I sent the BTC to the QR code address.

Connivence is what they’re selling. Their charge is whatever it is. If you don’t like converting your change through coin star or something similar, go to a bank. They will happily do it but will take way longer but will be free. 
On the premise of bitcoin ATMs, they’re taking the risk and jumping through all the hoops so the fees they’re charging is understandable. These ATMs aren’t for buying bitcoin, they’re for getting cash when you cant use bitcoin. Why would you regularly buy bitcoin from an ATM? That makes no sense when you can easily do it online. This is just a fiat gateway and for it being fairly new and not used as much for this such reason the fees aren’t really that bad. They will come down in time. Be patient. We are so early. Buy bitcoin, sell the dollar.

A bank telling you to not use another form of money but only use theirs. What a time to be alive. We are witnessing a revolution right before our very eyes.
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:08:45
Thanks. Worst thing you can do is just let your money sit there. Never “save” money. Keep a $1000 to $2000 emergency fund and invest. You have to at this point with inflation.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:03:43
You’re actually losing money with inflation. Your money just sitting there is the worst thing ever.

What are the advantages of having your own full node?
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:19:51
Yes. If you aren’t gaining more than the inflation rate of the USD, with your money sitting in a savings account, then you’re actually losing money. Over a 10 year period, with inflation sitting at 2% to 3%, you will lose 20% to 30% of your purchasing power without losing any money. You will still have the exact same amount of money in your savings but it will purchase less. 
Back in the 1930s, the government confiscated all our gold, gold bullion, certificates, etc. This set in motion “Quantitive Easing”, which is exactly what I just explained above. 
The reason Quantitive Easing was brought about in the 1930s, is because people were hoarding gold, and not spending their money or investing it into the economy. Around 15 years later, after all this was implemented, the Great Depression happened.

If they don’t change there fee structure no body is going to trade on there exchange. Especially if the fee to withdraw is high. Why wouldn’t I even want to deposit at all at that point.
