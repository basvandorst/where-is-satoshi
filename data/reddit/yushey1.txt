Are u playing bustabit. What's your username
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:07:14
When you sell alt coins. You always compare it to how much btc you will end up with. Why do you compare it with btc? Cause it's the best 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:04:28
You're an idiot LOL
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:03:09
It was auctioned and you could not buy less than 100k of btc I believe
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:41:04
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:44:20
1 year . I have good rep on it. It's good because it's a decentralised exchange. Only trade with people good feedbacks. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:30:08

Depends where you live. Just pay however you like. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:25:26

Why do you post this. Depression is real
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:32:25
I see then we would say
"I bought this shirt for 20 mbtc" right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:19:17
Gdax , localbitcoins or quadrigacx
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:18
coinbase has to profit too
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:19:00
He's fucking with you. You can't. Once the coins have been sent to the block chain you can only hope it won't get confirmed within 2 weeks then it will be refunded back. 
Check the transaction. If the sat/byte is above 100, then rip your coins. If it's under 100 then you got a like 50/50 chance for your money back
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:32:18
Idk man lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:47:29
You didn't make a grand. It's not considered profit until you sell it which I doubt you did
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:41
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:10:05
Buy ltc and send that
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:46:00
Quadrigacx. Localbitcoins. Gdax/coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:45:57
Thanks lmao just doing the right thing ����
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:23:18
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:56:51
No idea. Try it
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:55:00
Send your coinbase funds to gdax (gdax is coinbase) no fee. Then send gdax to where ever you want . Gdax has no fees
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:37:21
If you want to spend it, don't convert it to Usd. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:33:06
To the top
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:04:18
Quadrigacx. Also if you send btc externally from quad you pay no network fees. So it's blessed
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:26:35
Is it the same address to send back? Sometimes addresses change
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:30:34
Most likely ye
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:52:56
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:21:21
That's really good for your case. That means your fee has been super low and there's a high chance it won't get confirmed. So you'll probably get refunded after 2 weeks approximately
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:22:22
Good video
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:43:25
No idea who it is lol. I do several day trades on my localbitcoins accounts. I have over 200+ trades. it could be any one of them haha.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:33:28
I have some btc lol I just had a random thought didn't know the answer to. No need to be a dick sir
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:42:10
Only addresses. If the address is a another localbitcoins address it won't push the coins to the blockchain , it'll be just internal. With no fees
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:23:19
No idea. Once you get your money back I recommend you immediately transfer the btc to another wallet. 
How much did you lose btw
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:33:17
2m. I got 0.1 btc. Imma buy a fucking Aston Martin db series. 19 years old btw. Need 200k
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:19:35
2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:44:11
As a 19 year old university student, keeping the money would have really helped. But can't live with the guilt
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:44:48
You never know the other person's situation. Could be alot worse than mine.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:35:33
I live in Canada as well. Use localbitcoins and still it via interac E transfer
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:26:08
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:39:22
It appeared in my localbitcoins account. I can't attach notes to external transactions
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:13
Too soon
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:33:46
Perhaps. Who knows. Stealing is wrong
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:05:36

@_date: 2017-12-06 06:53:38
I like the way you think 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:20:14
Wait a day or so..  
See here theres alot of unconfirmed transactions, so it the fee will be high. When the number of unconfirmed transactions drop to undr 30k fees will be back to normal
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:41:00


Let's make the title sound like every Slovenians love Bitcoin.  
This subreddit is really trying hard to drive the price up
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:48:49
Rip then lol
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:09:37
Tech is great. But lets talk realistically, we all care about making the fat stacks
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:31:53
Unfortunately this is Canadian prices from 10 mins ago
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:20:25
They aren't really accepting Bitcoins. They are using an intermediate exchange to take Bitcoin and convert it to fiat which is sent to Starbucks. If Starbucks took the btc directly and converted it themselves, that's a different story. But that's not the case.
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:23:07
It is. Its the space between 2017 and 2021. Can't buy anything
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:17:59
I bet that makes you a skank
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:37:51
Please stop with this cringe
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:04:44
But the website accepting the payment uses bitpay which is a middle man that converts the Bitcoin to FIAT. A website using bitpay doesn't mean adoption. It just gives customers an easy way to spend their Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:55:30
Real shit tho
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:22:02

I have had 5-10 coins in the past year, but I always sold them. I have never held on to them as investment. I know how to get the coins and I know how bitcoins work. It's just the investment part which I'm concerned about. Thanks for the reply

When you can purchase retail goods and they accept bitcoins. No middleman that exchanges Bitcoin for usd
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:13:50

You can buy via cash deposit or interac E transfer from other people. Only trade with people with Good rep. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:25:28
It's cause of their fees. But if you're completely clueless just use it

I have 500+ trades on localbitcoins. and trust me, don't deal with sketchy people. just use cash deposits (safest).
edit: i doubt you'll see your 500$ again sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:46:31
Once its deposited, I also ask the buyer to send me a picture of a receipt with a note written on it. Saying trading with me. 
Once cash is deposited using the information on the void cheque. That's it. The other person is not allowed to withdraw. also make sure they deposit cash. Not a cheque. It says on the receipt what they deposited.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:03:05
I sell on localbitcoins, and asking for ID is extremely important. Ain't Tryna accept money from a hacked bank account mate.
@_date: 2019-01-05 18:52:12
Download the coinbase app, and buy some through your credit card. That's a start for beginners

Rip. If you had the private keys you could have gotten them back. The website held your private keys. Rip coins sorry,
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:22:10
Localbitcoins.com best to purchase from people in your country. Less verification process as well
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:25:41
Get RBC. You need non visa or non MasterCard debit card to use interac online. Rbc debit cards are good
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:42:04
