Oh yeah I wasn't trying to suggest that, maybe I misunderstood the context. I meant if you FUD and FOMO around with too many zeros you can pretty easily lose "thousands", but it's silly to blame the asset for that.

If you buy enough of anything during a pump, that's absolutely true. But throwing a ton of money at something at an ATH is just bad trading 100% of the time. Pure FOMO.

If only there was some form of public, immutable history of all mining and transactions of Bitcoin and some way to produce signatures as proof of address ownership! Oh well, I guess we'll never know.

Yep. So the lightning network has a bunch of nodes, not Bitcoin, not the block chain. So it's "decentralized" but it's still a network of nodes, less decentralized than the block chain itself. The transactions over the lightning network are multisig, meaning no one node can take a transaction and run with it. Multiple nodes would have to collude to do devious things. I don't know the specifics but I imagine it's designed so it would be difficult or impossible for nodes to collude. These nodes then open and close the transactions (sign them) and the funds are secured (with no on-chain confirmation). It's as fast as BTC transfers are now if you aren't waiting for confirmations (basically instant). 
Edit: this was more of an ELI5, not full of technical accuracy, always important to research yourself!

Right, but he's also saying use 100 satoshis (a 'bit') as the defacto unit.. which in theory makes sense given the current trending price of btc and how mainstream it will be by the time it hits 100k. 1 satoshi will still be really little value.

The wallet you use should suggest a transfer fee based on current load. If you pay 0 no one will want to take on your transaction. It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:12:06
I use it. Works like a wallet. Most importantly it suggests sane tx fees that allow your transactions to actually go through in a reasonable time frame. 5/7

Wait.. good devs? What? Isn't it like... Insanely imflatonary or something? Maybe I'm thinking of something else...

"market cap" does not apply to Bitcoin. At best you can use it to compare coins to each other in total penetration. There's no other value to that number, it is beyond meaningless.

Hash collisions. Yes it's possible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:55:20
Around $200 roughly.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:31
Actually yes. You can argue that these aren't true collisions because of the technique used, but 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:04:02
Absolutely go research. But the answers are basically "as soon as it's stable and processors / merchants start adopting it" and basically the same on the wallet side. Whatever app / extensions / thingy you're using will all start to adopt it. The idea is that the user won't have to do anything complicated, it will kind of be handed to them and as simple and obvious as possible. Like a debit card.

You can sign messages in such a way that you can verify you are the key holder of an otherwise anonymous address. It's literally a messenger.

I believe you can add a transaction fee bounty after-the-fact to push it though. Any wallet that doesn't suggest a current fee calculation tho is wayyyy behind the times. Maybe someone here can chime in about how to add a fee bounty to an existing transaction, otherwise you at least have something to Google for :)

It's a layer on top of the Bitcoin network itself. Bitcoin will have many layers, and layers on those layers, that do that actual day to day things. For instance, Exchanges are really a layer on top of Bitcoin, otherwise we would be using cash and PayPal to buy and sell and wait for long and expensive transactions. Lightning is a layer on top of Bitcoin. It brings the transaction fees down from very expensive to very tiny, and brings the wait time down from 20 minutes - 20 hours to 2-3 seconds. It's an abstraction on top of a single transaction.

I'm sorry what? 1% of people own Bitcoin? Are you out of your mind? Some tiny fraction of 1% maybe?

Please don't forget, America doesn't have the power to regulate anything about Tier 1 ISPs, and can't.. readily touch how most Tier 2's operate. Consumer ISPs in America would be the primary concern, and even then, they won't all flip some switch on day 1.

He's like.. a little goofy looking, and he's really awkward to talk to. His speeches don't have a flow that's easy to listen to. I don't know where you see charisma.
  
The man is a genius. He can take any subject and learn it at will, with sheer force of mind power and time. He is driven beyond belief. He doesn't stop. He never stops. Elon is anything but average.
