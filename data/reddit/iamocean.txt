Unfortunately yes, they are. Subsequently Poloniex which has been hacked before for 12%. I dont see them getting hacked again in the near time future, besides I wouldnt be putting a large amount and would withdraw every time Im finished

Being a soveriegn nation, industrial.. those 3rd world countries have no build economies, no jobs 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:27:58
Any sources on this? How would you do the calculation? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:53:30
You get to not be in a 3rd world country

Corporate tax rate is 35% sales tax 8.8% per item , income tax range 10-39% so whats the total? This doesnt count dmv tax, property, assets, inflation etc etc

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:42:43
what about this?
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:44:28
they are all greedy liars 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:23:32
Then you cant invest into bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:25:05
you cant thats why bitcoin wont succeed
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:16:06
Not on coinbase or gemini
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:29:58
pretty sure its tracible bitcoin is not anonymous cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:21:21
until government steps in and bans bitcoin because it would collapse world reserve currencies...and it goes to 0
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:48:54
if it were implemented tomorrow bitcoin would crash and burn 
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:19:03
You cant this isn dash or monero also you cant buy bitcoin without revealing your identity 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:19:58
Take down exchanges based in its own country. Then ip ban all other exchanges. Then if you say use a vpn ide say at that point bitcoin has crashed and burned and there wont be enough people to make it grow. Just look how bitcoin trades based off of other governments actions 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:35:01
Do you have any sources to backup these claims
"many of these officials have already been co-opted (i.e. they're hodlers and want to 100x their wealth via Bitcoin and not have to show up for boring government job anymore)"
All the governments needs to do is put a ban on the exchanges not shut down the internet
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:21:58
Exactly bitcoin wont flourish if its underground 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:43:05
you think bitcoin can continue to succeed and grow if it came to that point? Depending on when the ban would be implemented, I dont think it could most likely 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:25:37
Put a ban on exchanges, coinbase gemini...
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:16:18
Those exchanges aren't regulated enough, thats why. Gemini and coinbase are us based exchanges that are regulated like banks. You have to give them your ssn, proof of ids, etc They wont get compromised and if they do they can track it back to the person who did it, unlike the other offshore 3rd party exchanges, mtox or bitfinix, polinex
