Bitcoin went up and now it's going down. It's the classic up/down maneuver. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:38:21
Lucky for you. 50 BTC is a lot of money and small apartments are cheap. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:30:39
Why don't they just flip the switch labeled segwit/batching?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:40:22
Those people will divest just as fast when they're money keeps shrinking. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:32:45
Agreed. I wouldn't be surprised if it goes sub 10k for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:18:20
Survive lol jk not a joke
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:58:31
It may not just be all fear mongering. Some people just really believe the price will fall from here and to be honest, no one really knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:14:57
Not trying to scare you just don't expect it to go up forever. If you're just fine riding the waves, then have fun! I'm more concerned with the people who have been getting into Bitcoin lately who are expecting a quick Lamborghini. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:13:47
I think it'll dip again before that. There's usually a decent bounce on the way down. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:53:33
The blockchain was in invented for the very purpose of locking blocks so you can't get your monies out. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:43:59
I try to stay out of it, but it's boiling over lately. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:57:04
It depends on when you got in and what you really expect out of Bitcoin. If your in it for the quick money and you got in earlier this year, then it it very reasonable for you to sell. If you got in at the current price or above, you may not feel the same way. If you plan on taking down the banks you HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:19:19
That's exactly what I mean. New people that just got in thought this little dip was the crash, when the crash is yet to come. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:41:25
Man these new guys are so delusional. Still up 75% on the month and they think that was the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:56
At a beer garden in Philly right now but I've worked at some restaurants around the city. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:40:06
Downvotes until now haha. Just my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:00:53
It's true! Have you read the whitepaper yet? He put it in very simple terms. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:57:40
Wouldn't be that crazy. Even with the first drop we're up 255% over the past 3 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:36:06
Most coins yes, but Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:33
Just the brand? That's a major advantage. Apple? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:15:17
I think that's smart
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:35:40
Not in fintech. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:51:06
This. People just don't want to believe it. Note the "Denial" phase. The fear will set in soon enough and the hodl army will be tested for real. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:12:28
Soooo, buy the dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:34:11
Supposedly Mark Twain, but there is some uncertainty. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:39:55
This is great. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:00:24
Or watch your money dwindle away. Whichever happens to happen.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:49:03
True, the old convenience for privacy trade-off.   I'm personally not concerned with CB knowing who I am and where my coins are, but then again I'm not a massive holder. Knowing they can't freeze or refuse me my coins is enough peace of mind for me.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:43:07
Coinbase now has a multisig vault.  They can't touch your coins and you can move them without coinbase.  A step in the right direction.  Multisig is a feature Satoshi envisioned that allows trust-less interaction with an entity like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:32:57
Coinbase multisig vaults are nice. They can't touch your coin.

Man I'm 14 years old. I don't know what the fuck yield curves are! Is this good for Bitcoin or not?
@_date: 2019-08-03 04:04:57
Yes but how do I get in on these curves. They sound good too.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:15:51
They say more decimals can be added if it becomes too valuable to be usable.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:03:33
It's July 2014. A Bitcoin is worth $100. I read an article about it on gizmodo and think oh neat. 
It's January 2009. The first block is mined. 
It's April 23rd 2011. Satoshi disappears. 
It's February 2025. Bitcoin tops 1 million. 
It's January 2021. John McAfee is eating his own dick. 
It's May 14 2016. I think about buying some Bitcoin. I don't. 
I am tired of Earth. These people. I’m tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives. They claim their labors are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated with horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It’s too late. Always has been, always will be, too late.
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:46:21
Especially yourself!
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:06:42
No he was referring to the dollar being 100 cents. The dollar system we have now.
@_date: 2015-08-24 03:36:41
I'm more surprised seeing Cyanogen on there.

Bitcoin is coming off of meteoric highs.  It was gonna have some pull back regardless of China.

I mean is it on bitcoin's blockchain? My understanding of it was that the miners is what makes it a secure system. If it's not on bitcoin's, isn't it prone to all sorts of manipulation?
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:28:42
So is this running on *the* blockchain or *a* blockchain?
@_date: 2015-09-05 02:35:59
Then why would wall street trust it?
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:10:34


And they still fail to understand the basic principals of it.
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:19:21
Word. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:57:24
I thought the point of the vault was that you do control the keys.

It's no longer about nations, ideologies or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy transactions, sent by mercenaries and machines. Money, and its transfer of value, has become a well-oiled machine. Money has changed.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:11:59
here ya go.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:55:05
It may be an influx of nerd money in general.
