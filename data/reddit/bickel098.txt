you assume you know what I believe?

as more people mine it becomes more difficult
as miners find then are not get rewarded enough they will drop out
as they drop out then it gets easier to mine
cycles continues or averages out
i don't know all the details but what I can tell you is if you order top mining equipment sometimes it places like butterfly labs have delays in shipping. all while the difficulty increases and your potential profits diminish.
this question is better suited for someone other than me though..

I can't petition them to accept bitcoin. I don't buy their stuff so it wouldn't really be a truth. They will accept it in time.

perhaps I didn't use the best vocabulary and explanation of my thoughts but that doesn't make them invalid or any less a relevant discussion.
The more wealth you have currently and the later you get into the game the more risk occurs for you taking a net loss in your wealth I guess

Ryan x Charles just announced he was interested in building "Bitcoin wireless" lol as I understand is similar to this. That man has no luck, might as well join this team.

My opinion as right now?
1. I can't use what I don't understand but I haven't given IT that much of a look.
2. Whatever it does I assume they we will figure out a way to do in Bitcoin itself although I could be wrong.

I have been waiting for an app like this. 
I wonder if it will be relevant after the entire world is covered in Internet from google balloons, facebook drones, virgins satellites etc.
I would assume yes it will still be relevant,  but Im just pondering the implications.
In the mean time, This is something you can do with bitcoin that you can't really do with our current financial system! Very exciting. Although I Haven't read the white paper yet.

could someone clarify this for me please.
so if I were to buy a coffee with bitcoins but didn't pay a "transaction fee" then I could technically double spend?
how come this other guy says its impossible even in 10 seconds "look what bitpay does" ? ........this doesn't really help me understand, sorry
I need cold hard facts, clear and concise.
