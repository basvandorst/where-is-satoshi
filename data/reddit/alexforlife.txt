Several banks and several exchanges yeah, that was good advice thanks man! Limit risk on one single exchange
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:22:54
Thanks for the advice man, I guess selling at a potential top like this will be harder then, need to dollar cost average upwards when selling then?

I take everything as hostile? That is just stupid shaming language. I did not like your tone and I am perfectly privileged to express my opinion. What's up? Do you take offence? You take everything hostile? Wtf, go be bitter at someone else with a large BTC holding. This community is for knowledge sharing.

Yeah probably should not get to greedy and time the top by selling all at once.

I don't understand why I am the snowflake but not you? There is a logical dissonance in your way of thinking. Being the first one to call someone a snowflake, or telling someone they have victim mentality, does not give you monopoly on usage over those terms. You say that I ask a dumb question, you say that I am "Taking everything as hostile", you say: " You're overreacting " and calling me "a hormonal snowflake" Those are all accusations of me being weak, oversensitive and all that other crap. You are being an asshole and that is a fact. And you can't handle the fact that I am pointing that out, so you attack me further and calling me names. Go on, continue.

No I wish, I don't even have 1 BTC.

Are you even able to do critical thinking? You are not the only one that is able to criticize. You have just as much victim mentality for not being able to cope with my response. You say this was a dumb question, that is fine, "well that is just like your opinion man". No excuse for being an asshole.

Oh spare me. The people that say Tesla is going to zero don't know Elon Musk and are the same ppl that say Bitcoin is a fraud and will go to zero.

It is 150 000 now. It will be 1 million in one week.

That means bitcoin is not far from mainstream if normies have that kind of knowledge. She is by no means a normie. She is quite unique. First mover in YouTube, also first mover among women in crypto since women always lag in new things, still she is not a normie

I don't know man, I don't trust banks or exchanges, but if I had to pick, I would trust a bank in my own country over an exchange in another country.

It was a simple question, I don't have anything close to 25 BTC and BTC is far from $250,000. What's up with the hostility just because I presented a fictional scenario to learn from this community.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:34:45
Low time preference, have you learned nothing here? :-)

I'm whining you are yawning, I'm ego fragile you have no care in the world. I think we are having an argument but it doesn't exist for you. I'm a loser and you are so cool. And you say that I want to win? So you let me win? Woah thanks mr dear sir
