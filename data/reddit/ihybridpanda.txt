I was trying to buy some weed online probably back in 2012 and with no idea about BTC whatsoever I ended up on the phone to some guy who was obviously not interested in explaining to me how BTC works. 
I thought it would be simple, looked like it was going to be complicated so I gave up on it. I wish I had gone through with it and bought that weed so I had a funny "Smoked a $1000 joint back in 2012 AMA" story

How does a BTC ATM work? You can withdraw cash from it for your BTC?
Would love an explanation from someone who has used one. I know there is one in the town I live in but I have not inspected it closely yet

So you can laugh at bitcoin grandpa meme :D ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:59
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:52:33
Could you possibly make it so you can upload an image, and enter a price yourself. And then balance them against each other like in the lambo setup?
Means I could add, idk, the price of a house and a picture of a nice house and let the countdown begin.
Maybe an idea going forth if not no worries not tellin you how to live your life or anything
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:37
Sorry, could someone explain what is happening in this tweet.

When exactly IS the release of bitcoin futures? Said it was today right but is there a specific time or are we already there
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:32:23
You mean you don't check it the second you wake up on your phone that you take to bed with you so that you can check the price in the middle of the night if you wake up for 10 seconds?
Amateur shit

I had 500 peoples attention last night and attempted to discuss bitcoin a little bit. About 1% were interested the rest said I was promoting a ponzi scheme and that I am an idiot. 
Told them to come back in a few months and see what they are saying then. Counting down the fucking days right now

Indeed from what I read 6 months ago Tether was a risky play, looking full on dangerous now
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:21:08

They hit $0.01 in winter 2017, I had a friend that used to mine a bunch of it. Apparently in their circles it was the dream for it to reach 1 cent. 
Kinda cool was excited for him, long term meme bet paid off

@_date: 2018-11-28 19:50:25
Yeah thats true, I believe the correct play is to do what you think is right instead of allowing yourself to be talked down to and discouraged by salty people who got burned so far. Misery loves company etc.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:09:56
thats exciting I wish you the best of luck. Because wishing you luck is also wishing myself luck 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:24:07
yeah and your space cruiser would only have class 3 antimatter cannons :/ 
why even bother
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:45:17
why the end of december? 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:37:27
Honestly thats the correct play the people on here telling everyone they are idiots for holding out or planning for the future are the people who sold for a massive loss and are now wanting to bring others down to their level. 
Why else would they be hanging around on this sub and so VERY DETERMINED that they are right and that there is no future in crypto, because the realization that they might have fucked up is just unthinkable. 
Maybe it does shit itself and never recover but I am sure there were others like them during the last significant stagnant period that were proven wrong. 
Keep on doing you :)

Dude the Binance site  going down + the fact that even now the Binance desktop app is not working has chilled me OUT SO MUCH.
I do wish the App would start working again though I feel like a chimp trying to use the website version. The app is just so much better.
But damn yesterday I didn't think about it at all instead of permanently having it on my 3rd monitor 24hrs a day while I sit here.
Look out for the anxiety on the next up though :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:23:57
its practically 6k now, cant expect it to only go up :)

Does the tax year end at the end of Dec for the US? In the UK its the start of April.
I honestly only just started earning enough to actually be required to pay tax recently so I am pretty clueless, thanks for the response.

Its a life changer 
(It is actually working I just had to download the new version)
Uses way less resources than the chrome version, has an always on top mini version for tracking too. The "favorites" tab is just the best for tracking everything you need
