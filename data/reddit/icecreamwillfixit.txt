You draw false conclusions. Didn't read the article, but your quote says that "Micro-transactions and coffee" account for less than 20% of *money moved*, and **not** for less than 20% of *transactions*.
These less-than-20%-of-money-moved account for *far, far more* than 20% of transactions. If we focus on your bank-transfer-80%-of-money-moved-share, Bitcoin will be very niche with few use cases.
Also, what's the point of your statement anyway? That we shouldn't waste time developing Lightning Network since Bitcoin isn't meant for small transactions?

I do not think that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, but I'm pretty sure that Tether is one. For some reason, it's been constantly used to pump Bitcoin price in the last months. When the Tether bubble bursts, it might crash Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies significantly, and hurt "new investors" pretty bad. I'm sure that in the end Bitcoin will recover from it, but we might possibly have some nasty times ahead.

If he used ASICBOOST on BCH, wouldn't that mean that the total hashrate (BTC and BCH combined) would increase significantly whenever he moves a huge share of his mining power to mining BCH?
This doesn't seem to be the case, so I guess he's indeed not using it.

We have no proof that he's trying to harm *anyone*. What if he just truly believes what he says and isn't trying to scam people with BCH, but trying to make it a useful, growing cryptocurrency? Because I believe that he'll profit the most if BCH becomes a success, and it's in his best interest to keep the users of his coin happy.
BCH is no scam, it's simply *competition* for BTC. And competition is a good thing.

I never said that it wouldn't 'survive' the fork.
OP claimed that the fork would create a coin that could be dumped. But that's not true. You can't buy Clashic, you can't sell it, you can't exchange it for goods or services, and it's almost impossible to make a transactions with it. It's market value is zero and it's not listed on any exchanges. There's no demand, supply only. All you can basically do is mine it for fun and hope to find a block full of zero-value coins. And nobody will waste electricity on that, so it'll soon be gone completely.

It was completely unrealistic that BCH would overtake BTC so fast. And I don't think that was the plan.
They have greatly increased BCHs market value, making it a more serious competitor to BTC in the future.
And I think a little competition will be very healthy for BTCs evolution.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:40:07
Seriously, where exactly is the problem? I finally decided to look at the website for the first time, and it clearly differentiates between BTC and BCH. It even shows both prices at the top. When I click "buy Bitcoin", I can only buy regular BTC, BCH is not even an option there (yet). I couldn't find anything that could be misleading to newcomers.

See, that's the difference between a *contentious* hard fork and a *non-contentious* one.
What you describe in your OP will be impossible on a non-contentious hard fork, because there's no demand for the forked off coins, they have zero value.
It really is just an upgrade.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:17:52
There's a single mining pool, a block explorer that doesn't even work / contains zero data (yet) and it's still not listed anywhere.
I stand by my point, the fork was not contentous. Clashic is 99% just a troll attempt, probably from people that never even supported BCH in the first place.
And I'm still convinced that it's market value is and will always be zero. No coins to dump like you mentioned in your OP.

Hmm okay. But how do we know that he intentionally tries to scam people then?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:05:13


Nope, there's been a huge community supporting BCHs ideas for years now, and they've been very vocal about that for a long time. It was clear right from the start that BCH would have a lot of demand and not die easily, anything else was just wishful thinking by delusional people.


I feel like it doesn't make sense to discuss this any further, let's just wait 2 weeks or a month and see who was right.


Now I'm not sure anymore if you were just trolling right from the start. The BCH supporters will continue hodling BCH, the unsure will continue hodling everything, the BCH haters will dump BCH for BTC. No sane person will dump BCH for Clashic lol.

@_date: 2017-11-11 20:38:25
Yes because you claim to be a website that lawfully belongs to someone else.

A mere 5% of the nodes signal UASF, 15 companies support it to date. BU for example has a far bigger support at the moment (even though it may have more opposition as well).
The fact that promoting BU is strictly forbidden but promoting UASF is perfectly fine although it breaks the rules in a heavily m0dderated sub like this one, is more than enough proof that Core does support UASF.

The problem with these graphs is always that the companies's stances are of course in no way binding. They can express their support or opposition to something, but in the end they'll follow whichever side wins anyway. Especially exchanges would dig their own graves if they decided to boycott the winner, be it SegWit or BU.
The only thing that matters for UASF is nodes on August 1. It does not even need an economic majority.

Analogies like these don't add anything valuable to the Core vs. BU debate.
If this analogy was on the other subreddit, it'd be about core supporters crying "paid shills!" if someone drew penises on top of their SegWit logo.    
Putting it this way shows how absurd it is to claim that everyone with a differing opinion is a paid shill.

Let's be honest, the very same thing is happening here every day. Neither of the subs are better in that regard.


No, there is no filter at all if that toxicity is pro Core. It does not filter toxicity, it filters *opinions*, no matter how factual, objective and untoxic these may be presented.




I agree on rbtc being a complete anarchy. But rbitcoin is not a police state, it's more like a Trump-(or Clinton or whomever you prefer)-supporter house party that calls itself "house party for politically interested people", where everything is allowed and applauded on as long as it's pro Trump, but you quickly get kicked out by the hosts if you dare to voice an opinion that they don't like.


I like neither, but I tend to check out both to get an unbiased point of view about what's going on. Checking only one of the subs is unfortunately not sufficient anymore.
I'd also like you to read my response to Bitdrunk on this thread. It's not being displayed here for some police state filter reason, but you can see it in my post history (2nd post beneath this one).

Your understanding is pretty accurate.




Yes, on the surviving chain of course.


No need to move it.


You can do that! It's just a bit of a gamble. You can't be 100% sure which chain will fail, and the moment it becomes obvious it will probably already be worthless. Also, regarding the upcoming SegWit2X fork, it's entirely possible that both chains stay alive, coexist and both gain value, so you might want to keep both.


Yes, be careful though! Your private keys are the same for both chains! When you use your private key (or seed) on any third party service to sell your "failing chain"-coins, that third party basically get's the private key for your coins on the "good" chain as well - you should move the "good" coins to a new address beforehand, just to be on the safe side.

This isn't a BCH flaw and may just as well happen to BTC, if BTCs hashrate drops low enough due to BCH mining being more profitable for a while (there even were a few hours when BCH had more hasrate than BTC) or due to 95% of the hashrate mining a 2X chain.
It's just calculated risk for exchanges, nothing new or specific to BCH. Could happen with any altcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-06 06:28:44
Not disagreeing with you. I think we have to keep in mind that a huge part of it's value originates not from what Bitcoin can do today, but from people's expectations for Bitcoin in the _future_. In order to meet those expectations and thus preserve it's value, Bitcoin needs more worldwide adoption and use cases, so it needs decent scaling solutions before other cryptocurrency can take it's place. This probably won't be doable without introducing "instability", so to answer the question in your title, no, I don't think it's possible.
**edit:** Just to be clear, maybe I mixed the words price and value a little bit here.      
I think Bitcoin's price consists of two parts: It's value originating from it's usefulness today, and it's value originating from people's expectations for it's future usefulness.      
It is definitely possible to preserve the first value part (usefulness today) of the price without introducing any instability.      
It will **not** be possible to preserve the second value part (expectations) of the price without introducing any instability.
We can preserve the value of it's usefulness today, but the price would still crash if Bitcoin fails to meet certain expectations.

Wait, what?


I never even said that


I never even said otherwise

Dafuq dude
Let me try to put it very simple: The biggest part of Bitcoin's current price (~2500$) stems from people's expectations for Bitcoin's future. If these expectations are met, price will be stable or grow. If they aren't met, price will drop significantly. Simple as that. There's no way to keep a price stable that is heavily based on speculations.
To keep Bitcoin's _value_ stable, if we define value purely as what Bitcoin is capable of today, that's easy and no problem. But that doesn't mean that it's _price_ won't drop in the future.

If you stored them offline, you'll be fine.
There *might* be a chain split, meaning there'll be two blockchains operating independently from one another. You'll own your bitcoins on *both* of these chains, if you spend them on one chain, you'll still have all your bitcoins on the other chain.
The chain that the majority of the community uses to make their transactions will then sooner or later become the "real" bitcoin chain and the other one will quickly die because no one uses it anymore.
If you wanna be on the safe side in case of a chain split, just don't do anything with your offline bitcoins after August 1 until one of the chains has died. Afterwards you can use them on the surviving chain just like you're used to.
Here's what's most likely going to happen: A new chain will split off from the original chain, and then die within a few hours. You won't even notice it and nothing will change for you. No need to worry about August 1, it's much ado about nothing, really.

@_date: 2017-06-19 19:05:44
Both chains *may* survive and become seperate coins. If both survive it's very unlikely that both of them to keep their current value though.
Value is tied to *demand*. Demand is big enough to keep one chain at 2500$/coin right now. If we suddenly wanted *two* chains to keep a 2500$/coin value, we'd need *twice as much demand*, this will only happen if suddenly twice as many people in the world want to buy bitcoin, or if everyone willing to buy bitcoin would suddenly want to spend twice as much money to buy both bitcoin versions. This is very unlikely. Demand is going to split between both chains, so both versions may have a value of 1250$/coin if they're even, or maybe one will be 2000$/coin and the other 500$/coin, depending on which one is more popular.
However, if for some reason both chains miraculously end up keeping a 2500$/coin value, then yes, every Bitcoin owner would've basically doubled his invested money.

I don't think so. BIP148 really only is a big topic here on reddit, most of the rest of the world doesn't care about it or might not even be aware that it exists. It's support is dismal anyway, so August 1 is very likely going to be a pretty boring day for bitcoin and a few days later nobody will be talking about BIP148 anymore. Only very few people owning very few bitcoins might panic sell, not enough to significantly affect the price.

Exactly! BIP148 is like trying to cut down a tree with a lawn mower!

Interesting, reading this subreddit I always feel like it's the complete opposite.

Chill dude, no need to enter enraged mode. Consider taking a break once in a while if harmless comments on the internet cause you so much emotional distress.


Care to prove me wrong, or at least explain why you think it's bullshit? I'm always open for discussion

Dude, relax for a moment, take a deep breath and think things through again.
1. There's no proof ASICboost has ever been used outside of testnets
2. Bitmain has already agreed to [make ASICboost available to everyone]( Bitcoin could profit from that.
3. Keep in mind that miners gain money from block rewards!!! A succesful Bitcoin with skyrocketing value will make them far far richer than any ASICboost on a stagnating coin ever will! They wouldn't give a fuck about their ASICboost if they really thought that SegWit would make prices skyrocket. They simply don't agree that SegWit is the right way to go.
**tl;dr** ASICboost is not our enemy! The childish stubborness that prevents us from finding a compromise that all sides can agree to is our real problem at the moment. It's in everyones (i.e. users, developers *and* miners) best interest for Bitcoin to succeed.

Basically yes, people will then have two different kinds of Bitcoin, the original Bitcoin and... "Splitcoin" maybe. So if you own 10BTC now, you'll have 10BTC and 10STC afterwards. It's very unlikely that this happens though.
**edit:** copypasta from my other response      
Value is tied to demand. Demand is big enough to keep one chain at 2500$/coin right now. If we suddenly wanted two chains to keep a 2500$/coin value, we'd need twice as much demand, this will only happen if suddenly twice as many people in the world want to buy bitcoin, or if everyone willing to buy bitcoin would suddenly want to spend twice as much money to buy both bitcoin versions. This is very unlikely. Demand is going to split between both chains, so both versions may have a value of 1250$/coin if they're even, or maybe one will be 2000$/coin and the other 500$/coin, depending on which one is more popular.

Huh? Do you mean me or the 148 guys?

Why not both though?
It's not "either or", you can lower taxes *and* build electric cars.

Do you understand BIP148 or do you just support it without understanding?

[ok](
