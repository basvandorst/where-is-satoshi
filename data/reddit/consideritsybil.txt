I fully agree, it's a system that is incredibly easy to manipulate, no different really than the reddit voting system.

It can still be [done]( with verified users just requires a little bit more effort to create sybil identities. I purposefully made it obvious that I was just doing a demonstration by creating all the accounts with same name pattern and email domain name. They should be easy to remove from the database by searching for all email addresses with  While there are obviously more verification steps that can be done to make this type of thing harder it would still be subject to manipulation.

This wasn't intended to cause damage or economic loss, it was only a demonstration that community voting systems can be easily manipulated. I also intentionally made it easy to delete the accounts by using the same domain name on all of them.

I did this to make that clear to people.


I didn't see any terms and conditions saying one couldn't create multiple accounts or use automated tools for voting. Since this is not an exploit or hack but just automation of voting I don't see how it could be illegal.

Yep, once you make some sybil identities you can use [this]( code to automate the voting.

Yep, [this]( is how anyone can carry out a sybil attack
