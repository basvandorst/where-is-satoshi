Hi Free_Will,
Yes, we are currently in the process of evaluating suitable instant deposit methods for Yacuna, and yes - we are also looking at the UK :)

We at Yacuna also have a testnet faucet and fully functional sandbox for Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin.

Your not saying it's a scam but your are implying it. ;)
I say that we are a regulated institution and do not save any private keys and also request every user to only use empty addresses!
We are not responsible for any actions done buy misinformed people spreading their sensitive information across the web.

We should separate two issues here!
One is the procedure at Yacuna. We are an FCA regulated Bitcoin exchange and do not store any information after we signed the claiming transaction at the Clam network. We also make it a requirement to only paste empty and worthless private keys!
Second is the lazyness of people. Some people will do stupid stuff but we as a company are not responsible for people who try to paste their loaded private keys in every chat window expecting money to come out.

We are confident that XBT will be the ISO code for Bitcoin soon.

Thanks for the Feedback guys :)! So far we can only offer SEPA wire transfer for deposits, these are handled within 24h. However, we are already working on real-time deposit methods in certain countries.
Suggestions for improvement are more than welcome :)
Just let us know.
Yacuna Team

It is a free market and people are paying money for them.
The reason is that Just-Dice.com ( the former biggest Bitcoin gambling site ever ) reopened and accepts only Clam for gambling.

I think that all of us want to live in a decentralized future. The question is how to get there? Should we do it as a revolution or an evolution?
Individuals can of course jump on the decentralisation train and even live off-grid but companies have to many stake holders who are risk averse. So most companies will go step by step, lower their cost, join the new Wallstreet ( or however we will call it ) and at the end arrive at the same point as many of us already are.

I will comment on Cryptsy as I work for a competitor.
But there are other professional exchanges around!
We at [Yacuna]( are an FCA regulated UK exchange and offer BTC, LTC, DOGE, UTC for EUR and GBP!
More currencies will arrive in the next weeks.

Thank you for your detailed answer!
Our team at Yacuna will sit down the coming week and discuss how we can make life easier for you.

You are right, this is nothing special!
We are just selling cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. :)
Our goal is to give the community more choices to get Bitcoin fast and to help everybody to buy his first Bitcoins without sign ups in seconds!
