It doesn't seem extreme to me. Which miners are taking even close to 1 minute to push 1MB? It seems crazy to me that that's even a serious consideration when these people are dumping so much $ into their mining setups... and they can't manage to get even a 100mbit line? That's already &lt;1 second for 10MB (I'm picturing someone pushing out to a node running somewhere with a 1gbit+ line that is then used to relay... and this is only needed for someone who for whatever reason cannot get the 1gbit line right at their mining op to begin with) . 


Well, being closer provides benefits - sort of a universal law. 
I do like the idea of rewarding orphans as Ethereum does, however I'm not familiar enough with the downsides of it to reasonably give a  +1 towards it.

yes, yes, no, no, huh?
I can run a different fork with different features and interact fine with other computers running Linux. Centralization is fundamentally different in a p2p software project which is what I've tried to explain multiple times now.
If Linus puts out a version of Linux that operates differently than the kind I want to run it will not prevent me from interacting with those other computers (I mean if you want to be really pedantic... but I hope you understand what I mean).


Correct. Bitcoin has what, millions of users now? It's not where only advanced users can use it. We've surpassed that stage.

What is a bank anyway but organized theft? 
With each deposit you are ensuring a magnified plunder in the future. There is no escaping this reality, it occurs as the result of your actions regardless of whether you are aware or not.


By dutifully refusing to partake in an escape from this constant scam under the illusion your small glance at the world is sufficient to make intelligent choices you will invariably support the worst atrocities across the world and yet never be any wiser to it.

Not really wrt storage. The total blockchain is 128gb, or about 2 and a half blu-ray disks. Even with constant 4mb blocks the blockchain would only increase by 200gb a year. That could the the case for the next 10 years and fit on a $100 hard drive today. If we assume storage costs drop as they have historically in 10 years when it's time to buy a new hard drive I'm sure you'll have something larger than 10tb for $100 then. Even right now 10tb hdds are just $400 so I think we're safe on that front.
Bandwidth I know less about so I wont touch on that.

So if the vast majority of users have to switch software because 3 people in the same project died that isn't centralization to you? 


Ok, multiple branches from the same three maintainers/repo. This is pointlessly pedantic.

How am I reaching? Everything in my comment is falsifiable which is why I laid it out with links to prove each statement.

**Pre 2013**
Bitcoin users and developers have near universal agreement that the block size limit is a temporary feature must be raised and/or removed. Preparing for this hard fork is one of lead developer Gavin's top priorities.




However development priorities are not very unified, as noted by one observer:


For the first time in Bitcoin's history, arguments begin to erupt regarding the desirability of increasing the block size limit.
Many of the proponents in favor of making the block size limit permanent are investors in competing currencies/payment systems and this fact was not lost on observers of the era and can easily be confirmed by viewing the profiles of the participants:
In May of 2013, Peter Todd funds the production of a propaganda video:
None of the claims in this video are true, but it is effective in creating drama. Tensions rise and development work grinds nearly to a halt due to infighting.
BTC market share is 95%.
In December, Gregory Maxwell begins to revive the idea of sidechains along with Adam Back, TheBlueMatt, and other individuals who will go on to form Blockstream.
They begin promoting sidechains as an alternative to Bitcoin scaling.
April 7: Unwilling to deal with the drama any further, Gavin steps down as lead developer. At the time the BTC market share is 90%.
Sidechain discussion is well underway, yet a few people still manage to speak up to point out that sidechains should not be treated as an alternative to scaling Bitcoin. You may notice some familiar posters in these threads:
In October, Blockstream.com publishes their sidechain whitepaper:
The response is underwhelming.
On November 17, Blockstream announces the securing of $21 million in seed funding.
BTC market share is 91%.
On June 22, Gavin Andresen proposes BIP101 to increase the block size limit as the conclusion of his work performed since stepping down as lead developer.
On August 6, Mike Hearn announces BitcoinXT, a full node implementation that includes BIP101.
Many Blockstream employees, including Adam Back, call this effort a "coup", a claim that can not be made without admitting they believe themselves to be the legitimate rulers of Bitcoin.
In October, Blockstream employee Pieter Wuille proposes "Segregated Witness":
This is the time period most Bitcoin users are familiar with, which really only represents the tail end of a five year long fight to prevent the planned block size limit increase.
The BTC market share has been steadily dropping since the anti-scaling propaganda began in late 2012/early 2013.
It currently stands at 66%.

There is no objective measure to determine whether or not code will be merged. It is subjective, and up to the maintainers of the repo. Therefore, centralized.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:53:20
I don't understand your argument. It reads like you are agreeing with me, but your tone (is as retarded) seems like you are not. 
When one group deploys the client that more than 50% of users that is defacto centralization. If it was say 3 different groups where none had majority.. that would be decentralization.
But maybe I misunderstand what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:11:02
Well, I wanted to see what both communities said. You can even check my history - I'm not a regular there...
The idea to post there came a few minutes later anyways :/ once I realized that this post wasn't in the new queue here...
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:16:44
Which statement did I not prove? Do you disagree that blockstream is funded by AXA Strategic Ventures or that is censoring posts regarding this? I made a post the other day in regarding this - guess what, it never made the new queue. I find it absolutely ridiculous you'd be hostile towards someone who is for transparency in a forum for trustless currency and at least historically a great distrust of banking institutions. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:39:31
There are what, 3 maintainers for core? It doesn't matter if you "join" core if your code doesn't get merged. 


In other words Bitcoin Unlimited also has maintainers that won't automatically merge your code. 
Do you understand how open source development works? It's not like any random person can just get their code into any project on the main branch without the owners approval. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:35:58
What are you saying?
I'm saying that if you have a group of people who attempt to keep something quiet relating to who they are funded by it's probably not for very good reasons. 
I don't trust international bankers. I don't trust people who censor forums and are being paid by international bankers. Not that crazy of a viewpoint, is it?
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:33:35
I'm using actual definitions of what makes software development centralized or not. You are making things up as you go. Does "decentralized" to you meaning they live in different buildings?


Correct (well, there is no such thing a pure objective meritocracy). Buut... Bitcoin is different than Core. They are not synonymous. Bitcoin development is decentralized in the sense that people can fork it and work on their own branches of clients.
However currently Bitcoin is essentially centralized because if 3 people say no or yes to an idea it goes it. It's a 51% attack except with code, not with mining. Any ideas that go outside what these 3 maintainers want will not get in, and have no chance of effecting the system. Ideally enough people will switch away from Core to remove this attack vector and eliminate the immense power these people have that has clearly gone to their heads.

Pretending that I didn't prove exactly what I wrote is passively hostile.
Additionally, you ignored to list what I didn't prove.


That has nothing to do with what I posted.

Where is the funding for blockstream coming from? [AXA Strategic Ventures]( AXA Strategic Ventures is part of the AXA Group. Guess who was the chairman of the 2016 Bilderberg meeting? [Castries, Henri de (FRA), Chairman and CEO, AXA Group](

A single group of developers controlling the bitcoin protocol is centralization. What you are seeing with Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, and others _is_ decentralization. Hopefully it continues and makes Bitcoin the most resilient currency to nefarious influences. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:31:50
You could have a billion merges from people and still control the protocol by never merging ones relating to certain things. It doesn't matter how many people contribute nor how much code is accepted (other than all... but that would be dysfunctional) for something to be centralized.
If you knew what Git was, you'd know it is a distributed version control system. If you just have one branch that's actually deployed... it's operating as a centralized model. 
You also have no idea how open source development works. It's no crime to be ignorant, but I cannot understand why you'd be rude and have such a strong opinion if that's the case. It's just a way to make yourself look foolish.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:37:58
Why? I'm all ears.
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:13:38
Yes, it would. What sort of argument is that? Obviously 2mb can be handled fine otherwise segwit wouldn't increase size to 2mb.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:38:34
To do otherwise would be an attack on the subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:34:44
Well, certainly people would be able to come to an agreement in the next two years on what to do. It's a fallback so the same horseshit that's happening right now is prevented in future by a forcing of hands... what should have been the case during the 1mb setting. If you think that the core team could not come to an agreement in 2 years time for what to do past then I think there are severe management issues that should be addressed first and foremost... this would force that to be addressed as well. 
The effective 2mb increase is obviously fine, otherwise segwit would not require it (well, 4mb lol). In 2 years once harddrive prices have dropped in cost to same price as today there'd be a similar ease without removing "safeness" (which I completely disagree with as an issue but regardless let's keep our differences of opinion on this out of this topic as it's mostly irrelevant). 
p.s. Why do you downvote each of my comments prior to replying? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:24:44
This would work fine:
    
    // currently height is ~465000
    
    if height &gt; 470000 &amp;&amp; height &lt; 600000:
         max_block_size = 2000000;
    else:
         max_block_size = 32000000;
To be safe, people can wait and see how well SegWit works with Litecoin and this will solve the current issue of high fees and delayed transactions. This also gives a 2 month time period for updating which should be sufficient for nearly all miners and nodes to ensure a smooth transition. It additionally requires within the next two years another consensus to be made requiring what increase to the block size is necessary, otherwise the block size is increased to 32mb.
