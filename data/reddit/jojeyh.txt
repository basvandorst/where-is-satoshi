I'm afraid if you want low fees for swapping fiat for Bitcoin that's probably not gonna happen very soon. This is why it's so important we all just start using these currencies. Then we can do away with large fees caused by centralization.  Once Lightning Network matures I expect the on/off ramp to get much cheaper, since you will be sent money on LN and it will never come off.

Find websites where you can buy Bitcoin using PayPal or some other fiat payment service. Then all your bank sees is that payment service. 
If you are worried that purchasing Bitcoin will blacklist you from using fiat methods, you can always get a Bitcoin debit card. You just transfer money into the account and can use the card anywhere Visa/MC is accepted.

I think hubs will just form naturally over time in the network but its important that the base protocol is completely decentralized. 
It's not pricey if done properly.  There are strong incentives in place to not misbehave. You lose all your money in the channel if you commit some fuckery.

It only requires main chain when parties disagree. Google the paper.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:19:01
The goal of the LN is to move almost the entirety of transactions off chain. So in a way it is a panacea if it achieves its goals.

I used to try and defend Roger Ver cause he informed so many people about Bitcoin, but honestly that guy is such a penis.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:29:18
Transactions are routed through nodes (channels).  The really important part of LN protocol is that there is a time frame for redacting incorrectly updated changes to the channel ledger. If two parties disagree on the balance either can immediately post the current channel balance to the main chain. What's really great is when both parties agree on a current balance of the channel they can throw out the previous balance entries (transactions). This can only happen if both parties agree. In the vast majority of cases parties will agree so there is no need to have a public ledger for all transactions  (in fact any) as long as everyone agrees.

@_date: 2017-12-31 14:23:35
So in the beginning this may be true but once the network is matured new users will just join the Lightning Network as opposed to the original chain. They will have to run a bitcoin node just in case, but will not be required to first get coins on the main chain. Miners will still need to make transactions for their reward, but that's no biggie.

@_date: 2017-12-31 12:54:37
I get your argument but I don't think that's how it will end up. Once lightning gains traction new users will just enter the Lightning Network as opposed to the original layer.  To 'open a channel' you don't technically need to commit any funds unless you want to use coins on the main chain.

Very interesting.  So I looked up the price of gold during the period when it was outlawed in the US and used to build a reserve system on, and found that from 1934 (the year of the Gold Reserve Act) to the 1970s it did go down by over 50%, which seems to back up your point.  I'm still not convinced though, simply because in order for Coinbase to effectively implement a reserve system on top of Bitcoins, they would effectively have to be sure that users would not pull out funds en masse no?  They could lower the reserve requirement, but you wouldn't be able to spend any "Coinbase Bitcoin on reserve" without going through Coinbase.  I have the feeling that if this were to happen, eventually users would go into a panic that they couldn't get their Bitcoins back from Coinbase, and a run would ensue on Coinbase, eventually leading to its insolvency (similar to banks in the early 1900s when Jp Morgan was recking them).

I think it would be far easier to launch a 51% attack on ant other cryptocurrency network, which is probably why they are not as valuable. That was what we were discussing.
The new York agreement was in fact an attempt by miners to change the rules as they saw fit, but users running full nodes checked this move, so I'm more confident about the network than ever.  
Another thing to remember is that conducting such an attack is extremely risky and costs a lot of money because one must still provide proof of work and creating a block in Bitcoin is very very expensive.  The "farms" are actually pools of lots of large and small miners. So if a pool wants to collude with another it must convince everyone else in the pool, which is extremely difficult. 
mining is a bit centralized but the network itself (full nodes) remains extremely decentralized.  
Please don't ask questions as points in a debate id rather you just told me the answer and we move forward with the argument. Honestly I hope you found this informative and I also hope you do more research and really understand the nuances of the game being played because it's super interesting. But you're shit is basic and you need to level up.

If there was an energy crisis where no one could produce electricity banking would be the least of our problems.  Decentralization is about more than just banking. You say that Bitcoin is flawed because it depends on electricity and that makes sense but it's really the electricity that's at fault not the Bitcoin protocol. Currently electricity is highly centralized but there will come a time when it will not be, houses will generate their own power and electrical grids will be more fault tolerant. 
Honestly your argument is dogshit, so maybe do a little reading up before you just join Reddit and spew.

There are lots of places to use Bitcoin. More likely though as the transaction fees go up less people will use Bitcoin as a payment method and move to other cryptocurrencies. 
I personally think that eventually Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency and countries will peg their national currencies to Bitcoin, or back up their currencies using Bitcoin. 
When the Lightning Network becomes commonplace, I think countries will back up their regional currencies with Bitcoin and then employ second tier networks for their respective country.

Better to look at the exchange rate as a result of the network effect. You can call it speculation but A LOT of people are entering the network and staying (HODLing). Essentially the price follows the square of the number of users in the network.

I get what you're saying with reducing Bitcoin to a settlement layer not being true scaling, and in many ways I guess you're right.  Its not on-chain.  If the Lightning network becomes ubiquitous (it probably will) and is well made (the people working on it are straight from the highest echelons of Linux) then it will operate very much as the current Bitcoin network does, only faster and cheaper, albeit sacrificing a very small amount of security.  
And BCH and DASH may be scaling successfully now, but realistically there is no situation using bigger blocks that will allow a permissionless transactional network that scales to billions of users.  The blocks will undoubtedly become way too large to share quickly and efficiently.

I think if you need to move Bitcoin quickly you should absolutely spend 2$ to do it.  You can easily send Bitcoin transactions for less than a 1$ within hours.  The fees will go up as the mempool fills.  If you want to help bring down the fees then you should start contributing to Lightning Network implementations and writing/reviewing code.

If any of those transactions have to go in a block, then it will not scale to billions of users. Block sizes would become so large that blocks could not be shared in a realistic enough time frame.

I agree, a lot of block congestion is being caused by the political turmoil going on, which is why I am in favor of a political compromise to unify the community and bring that congestion down by a lot.  I think if a compromise is made and as a gesture of good will a community wide 2MB hard fork is planned a lot of these problems will go away temporarily.  Once we deliver off-chain solutions I believe that this debate will go away.  It's not a technical decision, but I still think it's the right thing to do right now.

I agree with you. It wont be an out and out ban. A damning law would be one where a government passes a very loose law regarding money laundering that gives broad powers to the executive branch to arrest and hold persons using Bitcoin.  By the government I mean people who are reaching out through the govt. An out and out ban is not likely because crypto is just better than fiat. Think about the internet when it began and where it is now. Its not illegal, but it's heavily monitored and censured by nations around the world.

I think even with the segwit upgrade (which i definitely support) a 2MB upgrade on the hard limit would be good just to relieve congestion for the time being.  It is definitely a political move though.  But I think Bitcoin is a really political thing and so some political compromises should be made.  Its not just an engineering solution and there seem to be a lot of decisions that need to be made which are not necessarily technical ones.  Definitely the tech will win out eventually though in my eyes.  The cool thing about Bitcoin is it provides a political system where people with the highest technical skills seem to have the most say, which is probably a good thing.

I think in general though we are talking about different things. Volatility is an exchange rate phenomenon, and yes it tends to zero for efficient markets. I'm talking specifically about growth and in general profits do not disappear or even trend to 0 in a growing system. I'm talking about a global state of wealth, not locales which exhibit equilibrium states.

At this point I think using the term 'volunteers' is a bit untruthful.  Even the developers who work on Bitcoin probably themselves own Bitcoin and are invested.  The CEOs are just people who are invested as well, albeit in much larger amounts.  I think an olive branch right now would be a good thing for everyone.  And I don't think they've contributed nothing.  A lot of them built a lot of services on top of Bitcoin and helped spread the protocol, and they made a lot of money taking that risk.  58 CEOs is kind of a lot of CEOs.

You're correlating things that aren't necessarily correlated. The exchange rate is not solely based on miner investment. Miners generally follow the exchange rate. If it goes up, more miners enter because it is possible to profit more given the current difficulty. Going down is a bit trickier since Bitcoin mining hardware is dedicated so people don't necessarily stop mining at a loss.
The exchange rate is most heavily correlated with the number of users, not the current supply which is programmed and cannot be independently tampered with. Its basically O(n2). The more users that join (purchase and use or store some amount of Bitcoin) the higher the exchange rate.  Miners simply follow this trend after the fact. 
One extra thing: Miners and their behavior certainly affect the exchange rate but the dominating effect seems to be user participation.
I think its worth pointing out that a lot of known economic principles don't necessarily hold in cryptoeconomics and so it's best to approach questions by building from extremely simple assumptions.

One example would be if the Bitcoin market cap grew indefinitely. Or you could just say if the wealth of the world grows indefinitely.
This is the classic argument against modern economics and its application of thermodynamic equations (diffusion equation). 
I don't think anyone really knows how ultimately all of the wealth in the universe will turn out.  Though here's an interesting fact about the thermodynamics equations in physics (which are used to model the efficient market hypothesis): the point of equilibrium for a set of global equations in thermodynamics is the death of the universe.  Supes weird.

But if DASH tried to scale to billions if users it would encounter the same issue with block sizes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:38:41
Firstly, yes they don't really contribute to Bitcoin in technical ways.  I think there a lot of contributions made to Bitcoin which are not technical.  They took on large risks and bet big on Bitcoin.  They have a vested interest in it.  They staked their lives on it in many ways.  Secondly, the SegWit FUD was definitely the low-point of the whole debate but was probably politically motivated.  Thirdly, losing some hashpower from the network is not that big of a deal.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:23:47
The only reason DASH can do this is because hardly anyone uses DASH. If all Bitcoin users moved over to DASH tomorrow they'd be experiencing similar issues. In many ways alts are the sidechains people use to transact off the Bitcoin chain. The thing is, using a bunch of alts as sidechains isn't gonna work when Bitcoin begins scaling to billions of users.

Only in a perfect system. Bitcoin and crypto in general are complex adaptive systems. It does not necessarily hold that things will come to equilibrium as in classical economics. Also, Bitcoin may come to equilibrium at some point (but maybe not) but is it anywhere near that?
Also ask yourself, is an economy (especially an emerging one) an equilibrium state in general? Has any economy ever reached a state of true equilibrium? It seems they grow and die. I cannot think of a single economy which has actually found equilibrium.

Also if LN is implemented as it is planned to be, then there won't be any downside.  It will just be an effective solution to the scaling issue and will operate in a permissionless way just like Bitcoin does.

That is the worst argument I've ever heard.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:16:59
I disagree with that simply because the only reason that those altcoins have those properties (fast transaction times) are because there isn't much throughput.  If all the users of Bitcoin suddenly switched Litecoin, then Litecoin would just be having the same problems that Bitcoin does.  I honestly dont believe that on-chain scaling is a viable solution, especially if we're gonna reach a billion or more users.  But raising the hard limit is a very easy change to make for the Core developers, and planning such a fork would settle down everything that is going on.  I think that's important.

Ok so if you get your private key you can just download the other wallets and import the key.  You should have 24 words that act as your private key for the Trezor stored on paper or file somewhere  (Not in the trezor). If you get these you can use to import key into bitcoin core wallet. Then you can dump the private key in base58 and use that for the other wallets like bitcoin cash. Once you have bch wallet running you should see same balance as in Bitcoin Core. Then send bch to exchange of choice and flip it for some more BTC! PM me if you have questions

Look into promising ICOs and/or existing ERC tokens. Altcoins will follow Bitcoin mostly, but these tokens will appreciate more if they are good projects. Look into OmiseGo, IoTA, Augur, etc.  these are like the new tech stocks that were emerging in the late 90s. Imagine buying Google stock in 2001. Much riskier but choosing good ones can lead to very healthy profits. Good luck!

According to classical economics it would go up because it's deflationary (in an economic recession investors flee towards stable and/or deflationary assets). 
Most of the Bitcoin to ever be released is already mined, so I would expect to act like any other scarce commodity and store value for people. 
People may tell that Bitcoin really isn't a good store of value because it's not backed by anything but that is a myth. It's backed up by millions of people everyday. Or because it's volatile. But in a recession when all the inflationary assets are going down in value, investors always flee to less inflationary assets.
It's really too early I think to make any real assumptions.  The price of Bitcoin is probably going to be way more affected by its continued improvement and solving is scalability. Once scalability is solved, look out, fucking moon bro.

The same way the network of people using Bitcoin makes it not worthless. You could say Bitcoin has value because of the cost to mine it but that's sort of misleading. It's the network that gives the currency the value. It just so happens central banks control a HUGE network (albeit a centralized one).

@_date: 2017-07-08 17:40:45
The Federal Reserve isn't really a private company, though you can make the argument it's a private non-profit I suppose. 
The Board of Governors is filled by elected officials so it's not really private. The governors are paid well, but they do not receive any profits from the interest accrued on loans. All profits are paid back into the Treasury I believe. 
I think crypto banking is way more effective and efficient then fiat banking, but that is yet to be proven (it probably will eventually though).  
Also, before the introduction of third central bank in the US there were multiple currencies being printed by several different banks (during the Wild West, expansion) and it was a disaster. 
A unified national banking system has its drawbacks to be sure, but I honestly don't think we would have ever gotten to this new method of banking without the prosperity brought on by the global banking system.
Now that we have cryptocurrencies, the Fed will become less important for sure.
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:35:58
Obviously the overall economy is what creates demand for a currency in the form of buying assets from that country, but the whole point of the central bank is to collect information on the economy and then change supply/demand through free market operations. Central banks aren't infallible. Their job is to determine where the economy is headed and what policies to enact to steer it accordingly.

Bitcoin is definitely a protocol. It supports competing clients as well. Devs are usually the ones recommending improvements through BIPs but the entire community has to reach a consensus.  If you're mad about the fact you had to wait so long in May it probably has to do with miners stuffing the mempool with fake transactions. 
Are you really agAinst SegWit? It will bring down transaction size and lead to the Lightning Network.  
If all you care about is being able to make quick transactions in the mean time you can use Litecoin, it's extremely fast. 
Also don't be an asshat, nobody likes an asshat.

There's no reason that there can't be a healthy amount of on-chain and off-chain transactions. Given that in order to fund a LN channel requires on-chain transactions it will probably end up that there will still be a good amount of on-chain transactions, probably for much larger amounts too.

Memory hard functions are a great improvement, but in reality ASICs are way more efficient power wise.

@_date: 2017-07-09 22:25:42
Dude take your meds. Please we care about you.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:44:31
The majority of transactions would be off-chain definitely, but the idea is that this allows for huge scaling. If the crypto with LN scales massively it's likely that the majority will be off-chain but because of the enormous amount of transactions required there will still be plenty of on-chain transactions in general. Hard to say how it would turn out. I would say without LN scaling seems almost impossible while maintaining some decentralization.
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:42:34
Also the way the Fed 'prints money' is by purchasing bonds from the Treasury. So the government is the one printing money.

No actually it has multiple clients, Bitcoin is just a protocol anybody can build a client around it. 
When people talk about centralization they are not talking about the Bitcoin client.  They are referring to how transactions are conducted by the network which IS decentralized.

GitHub may be proprietary but git is not. One could easily use git as the version control method for obtaining and updating source code independently of any proprietary organization. It is also easy to verify that you are getting the correct repository using checksums. 
So basically it's almost impossible to subvert the version control system (which is decentralized) given that there is a large number of honest participants.
Many people can and have maintained code repositories independently of sites like GitHub by storing repositories on their own computer.

If there are unusually large fees it becomes very expensive to secure the LN, but it could still work I guess. Honestly there's no reason to limit the block size to 1MB, more a latent fear of what may happen. I don't think it would change much though, might even make thins better once Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:41:44

Litecoin has already enabled SegWit and in terms of selling pressure it's very low. People in Litecoin are very loyal and have done at least some research. Bitcoin is full of pure speculators who don't really understand the ecosystem, so they will see all this drama and bail hard. I'm betting that Litecoin is going to get a huge pump from the Bitcoin controversy.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:57:27
Both will scale, Litecoin will always be faster though. Also has Scrypt algorithm which makes it more resistant to ASIC design, so it is more compatible with SegWit. The current Bitcoin controversy is really about miner profitability.

Yeah competition is not decentralization at all.  Competition leads to centralization usually. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:21:41
Agreed. Central banking system and floating currencies was 'least evil' at the time. They held it down for a century and people of course abused the centralized system. It's not that the Federal Reserve or central banks are evil per se, it's just that the advent of cryptographic banking means it is no longer required. 
If people think that there won't be wars and abuse in a world of decentralized banking they are kidding themselves. At best the wars will just be smaller.
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:03:11
Even if someone has a few seconds head start on the next mining round, if the difficulty is such that it takes 10min to mine each block and the hashing process doesn't give an unfair advantage to miners with more hashing power how would every single block thereafter be mined by only a single miner. Can you give a detailed explanation as to why that happens?

I watched that video and it seemed to make some strange claims. He claims that SegWit will increase reliance on miners but did not explain how. It should decrease reliance on miners by allowing off chain transactions? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:53:33
The concern over mining centralization is just the concern that a very large party will gain majority hashrate and most transactions will be conducted through that party (similar to how central banks operate).

The larger block size would be to handle the transactions for people using Bitcoin as a store of value. Nobody will want to store large amounts off chain. It's more likely altcoins like Litecoin will handle smaller transactions anyway. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:46:02
I'm sure there has been but using a more ASIC resistant algorithm at this point would upend the miners who have built huge operations around SHA-256. Better to just use an altcoin.

Central banks can absolutely change the demand for a currency. In fact that's a huge part of their monetary policy. They raise interest rates and demand for a currency goes up.  The whole point of a central bank is literally to affect the supply and demand for a currency through monetary policy.

Interesting read, even if this is true it's minimal compared to the amounts being dealt with. Obviously people at the top rungs of the top banks have a significant economic advantage.
