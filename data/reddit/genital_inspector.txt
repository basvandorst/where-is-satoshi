Gold sucks as a currency.  Hey, let me send my friend in Russia some gold for the program he wrote me.  Well that's  two fucking week wait at least.
Sorry, bitcoin is the winner.  Just tell your friend to shut the fuck up.  He doesn't want to be convinced.  I wouldn't try.  Just laugh at him whenever your investment starts paying off.

Any Google Coin is a god damned scam and you bastards promoting it are evil.  OpenCoin, Ripple, Buttercoin...all that shit.

It dropped to 0 once guys.  That was the biggest drop.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:34:08
This is mostly because you don't understand the technical reason it is so important.
Never before in the history of mankind could a decentralized currency exist.  Satoshi solved something called the double spend problem.  This person(s) will win the nobel prize in economics for this.

Sure they could change it.  This would cause all current holders to abandon positions making mining unprofitable.  The miners know this so they would not upgrade.  Hence if the programmers made the change, it would not be accepted.  There is constant dialog between the largest pool operators/miners and the programmers.

You mentioned fluctuations which was absurd.  I responded in kind.

You goober.  The evidence is simple.  As folks jump into Litecoin mining, the difficulty increases.  As it increases, it requires more and more hardware to mine the same amount.
This is true with any coin but GoldCoin prevents massive simultaneous hash rate increases.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:17:33
Ok..so the altcoin goes up?  You just don't have a point with this.  This is like those advocating against bitcoin saying it has little value as a currency because of the fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:47:38
It doubled the day I said to get it and it's a scam.  Fuck you prick.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:46:25
By this logic with inflationary currency you would never sell your house, your car or any other goods because they would keep going up in value.
Most people lock in gains and then invest in other things but still stick around the crypto world because it will truly take over all payment systems.
Say goodbye to cash, Visa, Discover, Western Union, Paypal and hello to Bitcoin, LiteCoin, PeerCoin, GoldCoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:55:09
It's "crashed" many times.  I would call them waves.  
Put it this way, if you were to design a near perfect currency what would it look like.  It would look a lot like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:24:59
Other coins are actively trying to keep GoldCoin out of the top 20.  It's not going to last for long.

LiteCoin has some major competition from GoldCoin.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:38:21
70+ trillion in circulating money world wide divided by 14 million bitcoins by the time it happens is 5 million per coin.  Given that there is competition for worldwide crytpo currencies, I'd say anywhere from 1-4 million per coin.
I just can't see anyone choosing to use Paypal, Western Unioin, Visa, Mastercard, Discover or any kind of fiat in 5-10 years when these currencies do such a better job and will retain their value over time.
Also, whole new markets will be created from thin air in places like Africa, etc.

Please stop telling others what to do and I'll stop telling you to stop telling others what to do.
On a side not, what you're seeing in cryptocurrency is not some new damn company, it is a fundamental shift in the mechanics of trade.  
Bitcoin and a LOT of the altcoins are going to absolutely replace most currencies, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Paypal, Western Union and open trade/barter in the 2.5 billion + world of the unbanked.
Honestly, having seen what's been happening for several years, your opinions are naive.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:17:49
If you want to get rich, buy GoldCoin.  It's listed on coinmarketcap.com.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:42:13
I understand precisely as I have mined for a long time.  As the difficulty increases, the cards and electricity will no longer pay for themselves so readily.
GoldCoin at least stops extreme spikes from happening. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:54:08
Go back to your hole man.  You're clearly an insane troll.

Bitcoin went up and down 200 bucks+ today all by itself.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:35:50
People are already using alt coins.  We're all in this together.  Bitcoin, LiteCoin, PeerCoin, GoldCoin, etc will replace MasterCard, Visa, Paypal, Discover and all forms of fiat within 10-20 years.

It's going to be short lived.  I'd check out GoldCoin as their protocol actively prevents those with massive hashrates from hogging the network.

Lol...are you insane.  What's a scam.  GoldCoin is in the top 20 dude.  It doubled today.  It's been traded a LONG time now.
Get over yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:51:57
I don't know but I do know the crypto world absolutely needs alts.  As bitcoin goes, so goes the alts.
If not for the alts, there would be no easy argument against making your own bitcoin.  Also, all alts have to compete with one another.
People shouldn't worry so much about alts.  I foresee a world where each bitcoin will be worth 2-3 million dollars and the entire alt market will compete for the remaining currency usage which would be an additional 1-2 million per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:54:43
Sounds like horse shit to me.  This reminds me of the fiat vs. bitcoin debate.  Purists sound absurd.  There is innovation in the alts.  Perhaps he should read more about them.
Does that mean they are better than bitcoin?  Hell no.
In the end each bitcoin will be worth millions and the altcoins will have to fight for about 1/8 to 1/4 of the total currency/transaction pie...imo.

Also, Cryptsy doesn't require real names.  You could go there in tor or a vpn if you liked.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:58:14
I believe you can set the transaction fee to 0 and send the coins to one address.  So in your wallet, set the transaction fee to 0, create an new address and send 1 bitcoin to it.
Just see what happens.  It will likely go through but take a LONG time.  It's worth it to try in my opinion as it's either going to go through or not. 
If it works, just repeat for 1 bitcoin at a time.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:54:44
It doesn't have to be done through cryptsy.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:17:18
Bitpay or Coinbase.  
Make sure you list them on coinmap.org.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:50:28
Got picked on for this but GoldCoin doubled today.  Like I said.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:56:40
You could trade some for alt coins.   A lot of purists don't like the idea but it really is fiat against decentralized cryptos.
Personally I like GoldCoin.  It is set to move way the fuck up in a matter of days in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:20:29
That's funny.

The types of chicks that would double up on you require many bitcoins.

Dude...just hold onto your coins.  This shit has been said time and again.  
It's not like there's a fundamental difference in bitcon between yesterday and today.  It is still a major breakthrough and always will be.
Hold and don't be stupid.  You will regret selling for a loss in a few months....big time.

I would say for getting intelligent, devoted people interested, this is big.
If we could get chessbase.com to accept bitcoin or chessclub.com that would be great too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:32:46
This is actually huge news.  Chess players exist world wide and many teachers have students across borders.  I believe we'll see more payments made this way now in the chess world.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:56:17
Also, Ripple is in NO WAY decentralized.  Google is a major backer of OpenCoin the folks behind Ripple and they are the ones that call the shots on their "stamp" generation.
With Ripple, you're trading one central bank for a new one.  I think Google has made enough money without having to print our money now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:19:55
I dont' know but we need cards like this for bitcoin and altcoins to be used as payment methods. 
This would be an AWESOME looking hardware wallet--sexy as hell.

hahahaha....that's funny.  Inaccurate but funny.  Go count all the previous "crashes" too see why.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:44:39
LMFAO...are you for real?  Dude, look it up.  Satoshi solved the double spend problem with decentralized currencies.  
I don't think you truly even understand what bitcoin is.
