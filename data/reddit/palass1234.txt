Therefore I asked people to not submit anything they are not comfortable with. 
If anybody likes, create a new wallet - for example on myetherwallet - receive the payment - and send it to anotherone 
Or just ignore this post

Just edited it, wanted to write BTC/LTC/ETH but the bot took it for talk about altcoins and deleted it. I just cut it out now. You are free to  choose. (Maybe not ANY coin on Coinmarketcap) ;)

we just fell to the point that nobody imagined we could reach exactly 1 year ago.

Thanks again, it is very complicated to find academic sources on cryptocurrencies and it is not allowed to just invent questions. I had to copy or adapt items from former studies from related subjects like online payment. And it is very complicated to find Good items appropriate for bitcoin (and PayPal at the same  Time - there will be a comparison later) because in Payment Systems how we know them, there is always a service, a company, a Hotline, whatever.  
If you Left your Mail, i would be glad to Share my findings :)

it is not... because i am not asking for coins or shares but lifetime experience from people who are at a point in their lives, that is still far away from mine...

I know I know... but even if it is a no brainer, AND I know most (rich) people say possesion of something makes you happy only some days... it still makes me think through it... 
You are definately right, I think I will follow your advise
