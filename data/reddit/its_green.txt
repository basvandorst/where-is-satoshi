Wow this exact situation is happening to me as we speak
Edit: I'm also used to transfers occurring instantly, but this is the first time this happened. Coinbase shows that the transaction is still pending and has 0 confirmations.

That's a lot for a bitcoin... Also shows up on Venezuela localbitcoin for that price

A 2010 pizza worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:45:47
Ah gotcha thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:26
Well this sucks... please update if it goes through for you. I will update if mine goes through
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:36:37
Just shows up under history and transactions on GDAX (not under holds) and on coinbase it appears as "Sent Bitcoin" with status as pending... Been like that for over an hour

It's on sale
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:33:53
That wall went down with like 3 orders of 200 btc and then some.....

Kinda similar to the mac app Coin Tick where you can display crypto prices on your menu bar... had to delete it cause my focus on work never lasted more than 6 seconds 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:19:49
It hasn't even been confirmed by coinbase yet. The transaction was performed on gdax over an hour ago and my coinbase transaction list shows that it is still pending, and has 0 confirmations as if coinbase hasn't processed the transaction

Only invest what you are willing to lose. If you have the mentality that you already lost the loan as soon as you bought bitcoin and have 0 of that loan left... then sure i guess

My bad, what I meant to emphasize was the fact that the ledger updated so quickly, was wondering if anything had been updated on their end or something... idk it was nice to see it show up quickly 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:54:29
If you are willing to accept that by investing it you might lose it, and if you can afford to lose it, then yes. 
If you need the money for rent/food, then absolutely not at least until you get on your feet and get some steady income that you can afford to potentially lose
In the meantime, research it so you can make a more educated decision whenever you do decide to buy some!

I think OP meant they want to get coins off the exchange before temptation causes them to sell

Another step climbed on the trip to the moon

A minor setback

It's about to hit 11,000 USD

Depends on how much it goes up each month, without knowing that it's hard to tell. Here are two polar examples of this
Scenario A: invest 500 a month for 12 months starting at 12.5k, next month price goes to 25k and flatlines for next 12 months. You end up with $6500 after your 12th investment.
Scenario B: invest 500 a month, this time price stays at 12.5k until month 12 and then doubles, you have $12000.
Point being, without knowing the rate of growth it's difficult to calculate how much fiat you will have at the end of 12 months, even with a hypothetical pricepoint. You can play around with rates and say 
((StartingPrincipleEachMonth+MonthlyDeposit)*MonthlyGrowthRate)=MonthlyTotal for each month.
Carry over the starting principle from previous month total for each consecutive month.

I'm confused
Edit: Wait nvm article is in Australian dollars

Best time to buy bitcoin is yesterday. Second best time is now... third best time is on weekly/monthly repeating purchases
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:57
That's a shame
