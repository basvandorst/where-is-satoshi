The  moment I got into bitcoin are started reading charts, well at least trying. It has really helped alot although most of it is just speculation at least you have some idea of where to buy. If Bitcoin goes to $8k, that's my next entry point.

Sounds like a solid plan

It's exciting right? I got my first $350 worth a few days ago now I'm hooked.

This was me a few weeks ago. I bought on just over 7k, after that the price took a dramatic dip. Since it was my first time I just carried on doing as much research as possible. Basically most people have no idea what they're talking about but the best advice iv picked up over the last few weeks is to "Hodl".

What's your personal strategy to deal with the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:10:01
I won't sell and ofcourse it was spare money just sitting in my bank so I can take a loss no problem. I just hope it bounces back, buying right now, while it's low, is a great opportunity.

Important question. From what Iv gathered, this doesn't seem like it's in Bitcoins best interest. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:12:43
I bought yesterday as well, although I also bought some Bitcoin Cash. Silverlining and all that shit.

Iv  read as much as I can as I am new to this. I bought my first Bitcoin last week. So when the fork happens? What does this mean for BTC? Is it possible that it will go bust?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:21:37
I'm pretty sure that's not why they exist

FOMO kicks when a drop from 11k to 9k happens, especially with the noobs. In my opinion, I think we still got alot of sliding to do still.

Considering I bought my first 0.1 last week, I do feel abit stressed. To make matters worse every prediction iv read on Reddit has been wrong thus far.

Profit and greed are also the reason banks plunged the world economy into a recession in 2008. Decentralization is extremely important.
