Linda depends on the apocalypse of course but yeah I always thought it was weird how much we've liked gold over the millennia considering we never found a real use for it until recently

But what if it's symbolic value outgrows it's inherent/intrinsic (whichever is correct)

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!! How old are they? I've been thinking about it for probably 3-4 years so if it's newer than that then I claim it!!!!

Ico? I'm sorry I'm not sure what that means lol

I always thought a cool dystopian/post apocalyptic currency could be honey. It's limited in supply and production. It has caloric value. It never spoils.  I don't know why I'm sharing this it's just a thing I thought of

Yeah she leads a pretty sad, but interesting life.
I'm not gonna bother editing because I live for people calling out funny spelling mistakes

I'm sure it does EVENTUALLY (can't do italics on my phone sorry) but from my understanding it's considered "the only food that doesn't spoil" I've heard it might be that the honey itself doesn't go bad but the containers it's in will contaminate it first.
