Have been doing this since Feb 2018 :) but I never thought a reputed Journal like BI would make such a mistake

Man you nailed it. I was thinking the same thing, people who generally loose money are traders while Holder are generally safe. But hodlers too are impatient. I know quite a few people who have invested their savings back in Jan 2018. Now these guys don't look at the market daily, but when they do they get dissapointed. Its their fault, but still when they pull out, money is lost.

I agree....Government officials are underpaid workers. Now if a big corporate comes with almost unlimited money to well just make haggle some data, the official would take it. Human nature in itself is greedy. More regulations will just act as catalyst for these government officials to make more money from the corporates.
What can help is making all the data publicly available. (I don't know if it is). say all the data are stored digitally and publicly available, this will make it tougher to sell thrash as gold but not impossible. But it will be a start. Look at how through the internet fake stocks and Penny stocks scams have decreased.

Isn't it where the problem is. If due to bad actors, good actors are at a loss...how will a system take off? How will it adopted by the masses?

Thank you for the update James :)

Decentralization still requires gate keepers to ensure that its not missused. Look at Facebook, completely free, big moto such as connecting people, freedom to express blah blah. The truth is now its being missused and the government is stepping up.
I think same goes with Bitcoin. Decentralized or not decentralized it's a legitimate tradable asset. That means it should come under SEC and other jurisdiction. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 17:21:19
Yeah...once they have good amount of Bitcoins they will be like hahaha...we are making legal

Mordern society calls owning home an ultimate achivement in life. In my previous company everyone I talked to wanted to own a home, that was their ultimate goal. And these were people in their 20s and 30s. Male and Female both. No wonder, people with big money find it easy to dupe people. Kind of reminds me of charlatans of 17th &amp; 18th century who would sell snake oils to people with diseases.
The financial ads you see of the newspaper &amp; televison are just marketing material not financial advice.

I have been thinking....why don't we all as community come together and lay down some guidelines for protection against these kind of manipulations...
 I agree "whales" have the capital but we all combined together can become more stronger than them. 
We have been in this space for many years, much more than these whales...we shouldn't be dependent on them, instead either work with them or fight literally them

I agree...many people did compare Bitcoin to digital gold back in 2010 and so, but it drained in popularity due to bad media press due to its association with Dark Web. But now I guess its back on track

It wasn't fully rolled out, plus it was disabled soon after. But not with a new exchange under its belt, it will relaunch the service.
@_date: 2018-03-19 09:56:50
Max they would do is beef up the security... Japan and Korea wouldn't want to part with Cryptos... As they are too profitable for them

It's an opinion. Everyone has the right for an opinion. The choice should be left to me to decide whether I want to believe their opinion or no. Now I don't believe what they are saying, but I do respect their right of opinion even if it is wrong. Today they are censoring based on political views, tomorrow they can censor base on anything.
I realised long back, there are always 2 answers: the one which people believe and the one that is true. Just because majority believe it's right doesn't make it right. It's always good to know both the side of the reason and make your opinion.
Imagine if religious franatics still kept on censoring documents related to astronomy! Where would we be? You believe earth revolves around Sun, stop his bank accounts. Don't get me wrong here, I am still not saying that whatever Gab has is right. No one knows. But a true democracy would never eliminate opposition's thoughts.
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:50:40

@_date: 2018-03-21 07:27:55
It can....but luckily it got found...I am sure the core devlopers would fix this issue! There shouldn't be any data except transactional data..if there is anything else it could pose a serious threat/security flaw in the Blockchain, and will indirectly effect Blockchain adoption. My only concern is, no one in the group and other communities seem to have reported it, so I am wondering whether its a media propoganda against Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:43:44
The original bitcoin is called bitcoin and the fork is called bitcoin cash
@_date: 2019-01-09 12:23:04
True..end of 2017 wasn't a revolution, it was a bunch of people getting inside a bubble. But it did glimpse us with what would Bitcoin worth be if 500 million people join here.
The revolution is ahead. Not institutional money, but a revolution to finally ditch the old financial institutions and embrace the new one

Miners are concerned about the fact that most of the transactions would happen off chain, and I don't blame them. Most of their hardware has come through a substantial investment. And they would want profits from their investment.
But for Bitcoin to grow as a daily transactional currency it has to be fast.... lightning is the best bet as it keeps the network truly decentralized. Large blocks are a short term solution, and considering the amount of transactions going through BTC its even shorter. PoS on the other makes the network centralised, that is only people with money can take part in the mining. Rich gets richer.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:15:39
huh...why do you say so? They have just introduced lightning...
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:21:59

@_date: 2019-01-23 12:41:11
That's what I like about Bitfury, they are into mining as well. But instead of trying to fight lightning without even testing it out, they are embracing it. Even helping it adopt, unlike Bitmain...that's more concerned about less mining profits.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:30:56
That's because they are working on their own Crypto currency
@_date: 2018-03-25 06:39:15

I agree but 0.3 times from december! Its bad and boosts the morale down of the people, and if the whales keep manipulating the market other people will just stop playing the game. We don't want to do that right?
