yes that may be the case, but even without the patriot act these measure would be in place

but if it is only a few coins and they are now aware of the issue, why is there so much fear and animosity? Are they working to fix it? Are the BTC withdrawals going to resume -- has the company assured clients that withdrawals will ever come back or is everything in the dark?
I am located in Canada. Still thinking about it, but trying to get the best understanding from people who are intimately acquainted with BTC.

i think you may have misunderstood, which may have been due to my poor phrasing. i meant to mitigate risk on the bank's end by limiting the amount you can just walk in and take away. they only stand to lose 5,000 (as per the quoted text above), whereas anything above will be scrutinized by both their internal and external services to ensure the credibility to the person withdrawing.
basically saying they want to limit the amount they can lose if someone ends up scamming and tricking the tellers. if they have to return to get the money at a later date and provide more info/docs, they will be less likely to go through with it and far less likely to succeed

this, and it is to mitigate risk. there will be many more checks and assurances (revenue services, etc), and you cant simply walk out with 10,000 even if you fool a couple of front line employees.

but wouldn't the price be much higher to do so? The reason MtGox looks so tempting now is because the price is so low and the potential return is so high. 
If I do set up a Coinbase account, what do you mean about wait for the correction? Is the market not experiencing a correction now? Are you anticipating further drops for BTC as a result of this -- or any other issues?

I mean, I can throw a couple thousand at it for now. If they are solvent, and I end up with 10 or 20 BTC that sounds like a huge plus if they ever hit the 1,000+ mark they were once at. 
Where did the uncertainty with MtGox originate? Why would they claim more than they have and aren't there processes to determine/obviate that?

so you are predicting a correction towards the 3-400$ mark? I've only ever seen people here talk about BTC going upwards "to the moon" and eventually having the potential to be worth a few hundred thousand per unit. 
Is this wrong? Can you provide a reasoning to substantiate your claim? I want to understand why and where it will go. Thanks!

okay, one question guys. can you really mine half a bitcoin a day? on such an inexpensive machine? i had read that it was not really profitable to mine coins anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:03:22
well, you can first start out with the reasons why this would keep your money safer. you really offered no insight whatsoever into the questions posed.
what threats would be there that would, or coul potentially, necessitate these actions?

this is why I am skeptical about digital currencies. Doing this is such a formidable and arduous task that it would deter any sort of popular use. I am above average in terms of computer skills and still found that ridiculously difficult -- imagine the rest of people who have trouble setting up netflix on their computers. 
can you explain why exactly you would go through these steps? I'm genuinely curious as to what the benefits of this are and what the thought process behind them is.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:09:18
but in terms of actual money, its a little different. 
what risks are posed by becoming a millionaire overnight? what would you be safeguarding your btc from? is it not safe just on your computer?

its easy if you think of it in terms of fractions:
small and large denominator respectively when written. the exchange would just be a numerical representation of the two inputs
