Legally they can't, even though the Bitcoins are worth loads more now and they could easily pay everyone back, bankruptcy laws mean creditors have to be paid back in the local currency of the state in which the business is incorporated, which in this case is Japanese Yen.

It means they report your transactions to the IRS and you can be easily monitored just like when you use Visa / MC / AMEX.

I know personal transactions fall below the limit, but you're still supposed to check to prevent money laundering scale mini transactions (which HSBC gone in trouble for with the Mexican 
 drug cartels). They were sending family people with small amounts to cash and then transfering it to bigger clearing accounts of the country, on an industrial scale, millions of people cashing only a few dollars each day, added up to many billions per year.

I've never actually seen a LocalBitcoin ATM, I assumed it was only for transfers, my mistake! I'm gonna have to visit Finland just to see one. Here in Barcelona we supposedly have seven ATM's, but the last time I checked they all closed down. The government keeps hailing the "crypto revolution", but everyone I know in crypto in Europe works in London.
