i get charged about 5% with my bank for circle

they do, they just choose not to exercise it. I do believe the country was founded by taking power from oppressive regimes, but unfortunately the USA has fallen back to pre-american revolution freedom levels.

that link does not inspire confidence, I do not know what that is and don't want to check that out..

I have been using bitcoin regularly for a year and I don't know how much 0.01 MBTC is
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:25:06
apparently they are hidden under the "legacy accounts" section, causing unnecessary panic for im sure many users, so check there! 
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:23:33
I would be happy to but I can't. They can exchange bitcoins for dollars instantly for free if they like. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:36:49
I like how using bits brings the "dogecoin" like tipping and community feel to bitcoin

the ad comparisons are great; the childish bashing on their twitter pages is indeed shameful.

I have always wondered how to use QR codes that are not bitcoin addresses, I have seen them on occasion but I don't know how to scan them. Good to know there are app(s) for this. Definitely needs to be some more practical way to read btc addresses.
@_date: 2014-10-20 12:19:13
why would they use mbtc and fractional BTC in the future? answeR: they won't
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:17:55
I agree it will be fixed in time, and something as easy as a phone number would be great. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:35:25
sent them an email and told them about bitpay, hopefully I get a response! I find it ironic, I cannot donate to doctors without borders because of arbitrary political borders around my money in the legacy banking system.
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:40:00
who prefers to own a fraction of something? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:17:30
just trying to understand your perspective, are you saying that the current bitcoin addresses are perfect as they are, and that there would be no value in making them shorter or more easy to remember (short term)? 
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:17:02
yes please, I will spend my 4 bitcoins on a chain of islands. Can you please link me to your source?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:06:46
currently they do not accept bitcoin. I think this would be an amazing time to raise awareness about bitcoin and help a cause in need. I don't want ebola spreading to my country, and the health workers are dying, desperate, and under-funded. Heroes that need help. I am sending them an email now to accept bitcoin donations.

or until Americans force the NSA out of existance. Seriously, isn't it a free country over there? I am shocked to see this company constantly get away with so much, or Do most Americans believe the NSA is beneficial?
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:40:48
i've tried, sent them an email and they just said they accept credit cards. Worthwhile to keep trying.
@_date: 2014-10-18 08:51:01
except the rest of the world doesn't have the power to make the changes the American citizens do; but choose not to.

feels like spam to me, unlike the advertisement comparisons which were pure gold

well, i'd hold some amount. Why cash out 100%?

"Who wants to own a full bitcoin?" just doesnt have the same ring as bitcoinaire does
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:17:38
is this an endorsement from google?
@_date: 2014-10-09 09:29:45
awesome choice, I like how using bits works well with the XBT standard denomination. Finally, we can get some unification and simplicity that will help with mainstream adoption (people+fractions=uncomfortable)
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:00:50
it costs me ~5-6% to buy bitcoins from circle with my bank account.
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:30:41
me too. Decimals = bad   
people = don't want to buy a fraction of something
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:01:19
bitcoin units are not acceptable. People do not work with fractions or decim unless its absolutely necessary.

I didn't even know what G+ was at first. Ouch.

 i believe so, I remember having a really hard time doing it, I hope I followed through completely.

i was just wondering yesterday while watching Andreas talk to the senate, can we make a test net to try things out like this to test bitcoins resiliency? When he was asked about the selfish mining problem, he didn't have a concrete answer. Why don't we simulate this and see? Why not have a play-money test network where users are encouraged to try to double spend, spam, etc and where we can simulate selfish mining (and such)? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:21:40
I don't know much about NFC but it does seem like something that will be more convenient in the future (its hard to be less efficient than what we are currently using, where copy/pasting long strings of text is sometimes the best way). I think having a string of words would be an improvement, at least having the option to do so, but why do public addresses need to be so long? Of course, having the correct public address is by far the most important factor, but they are also something that we do use, and see, and have to painstakingly type out, or copy/paste on occasion.

@_date: 2014-10-30 05:09:26
although I do agree with you for the most part, why do we trust them? They have not verified their RNG, and they do not prove they own all of the funds, AFAIK. Trustless sites would be a huge step forward.
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:37:02
how? I do not have any accounts in USD. I could if I had a US bank account, I suppose, but I do not. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:16:26
I agree, although why can't there be another mathematical function that would transform specific addresses into more friendly ones? Why shouldn't doctors without borders have a specific bitcoin address? There is definitely some use for addresses that will be re-used for a period of time. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:56:24
we can still ignore the transaction size/limit problem, right???

its on the winning poker network, house takes $100 out of the $5100.  Great room, I love their bitcoin integration; allows USA players to play :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:55:25
Americas card room or true poker, true poker is working great with BTC now and I think the others are still implementing it
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:55:03
36 entrants for a $180,000 prize pool. "RescueGenieFromReno"  from Vancouver is currently chip leader with $24,0055 in chips and  here is the 2+2 thread about it. the WPN network is truepoker, americas card room, black chip poker, and a few others. They all accept bitcoin deposits now I believe, and I think all will have withdraws working by next week. I have withdrawn some bitcoins already as a test and it was just fine! 
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:35:10
this is an extremely underrated factor in dealing with bitcoin. WE need unification, and a unit that uses whole numbers. People hate fractions. Bits will work better.
