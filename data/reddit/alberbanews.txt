Excellent explanation! Reading it gave me the chills - the good kind.

One big vicious cycle.

I think people will begin using them when the price is not so volatile, which might be when many, many more people own them.

Never had Reddit Gold before. Is it like internet magic!?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:34:53
No, I haven't used LB yet. I probably should have, but I'm just going to get my girlfriend to get verified on Vault of Satoshi and buy some, since I heard they're pretty quick, and she has photo ID and I don't yet. I hate this gold rush.

It's on its way back up now. Happens every time: Goes down a bit, then shoots past it and breaks new records. This will go on for a long time.

Are bitcoin sellers just slowly raising the price because they can, and because people are willing to buy? Then can't they keep doing this for, like, forever, since bitcoins are under so much demand. 
Like, since I want some, I have no choice but to buy them at their current price, and sellers know this and continue to slowly increase the price. Will there ever be a point when bitcoin buyers are like "Nope, too much, not buying at that price".
I don't know how this works, so I'm probably wrong about this, but I'm just wondering. Maybe a ELI5? lol

My teller said she couldn't send my VOS account number along with it, but I did email you guys with the USD quantity and account number - this okay?

Please hurry with the CAD implementation!. I went today to BMO to deposit $150 CAD and once converted to USD, was only $138 USD.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:49:32
I cash deposited $150 CAD at BMO a couple hours ago, the bank converted it to $138 USD. They attempted to charge me a $2.50 "handling fee", but the teller was told she could enter "$0.00" for it. So not fees, just the pain-in-the-ass of having to convert to USD and lose a little money kinda. $15-or-something fee on Bank Wires, though. Can't wait till VOS has CAD!

@_date: 2013-12-04 01:27:18
I agree. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:18:19
I kinda wish the value would stabilize so it wouldn't be so scary using the currency.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:33:02
Are any Canadian exchanges doing this as well?

Do orders usually take fooorreeevvverrr to go through on VOS? It feels like it's just people on there looking to make money by selling, not really much more buying - am I correct on this?
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:17:54
I'm glad you're having good luck; I'm having bad luck.
I originally tried to get some via Cavirtex, but they require photo ID, but I have to get an ID and that'll take who-knows how long to receive (and at a cost of $50).
So I tried to contact a few people on LocalBitcoins; there were three, but all three of which had ridiculously expensive exchange rates listed - like $40 above Cavirtex price.
I contact one but didn't get a reply. I contacted another and asked if he could give a first-time bitcoin buyer a little discount, and he basically told me to screw off and go buy on Cavirtex.
This has really turned me off. So I'm back to waiting to get my ID, and by the time I get it, 1 BTC will probably be $700. FML

$1 million, holy shit. You could buy something like that in NS for $150 000.
