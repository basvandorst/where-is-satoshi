Your comment is so divorced from reality I'm not sure what to say other than seek help.

More word salad.

Guess again.

Lol you know that no one believes your bullshit when you say things like "I'm no trumpet." We all know what you are.

Omg! I've never won an internet argument before!!!!
Is this what power feels like? My penis is rapidly engorging with blood.

Amazon won't accept it until it scales if I had to guess. I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon operated a LN node once LN is stable.

What do you mean? Technical analysis is a tried and true science that has been proven time and time again over the years.
Just like voodoo!

Bailouts helped the US economy rebound from the crash significantly faster than had they not happened. When credit and accept to capital is no longer available the economy grinds to a halt (financial services are basically steroids for an economy).
The thing is, once you bail out the banks and things start running smoothly again you can't let them just "get away with it." You break them the fuck up so no bank is allowed to be "too big to fail" ever again. Well that never happened and instead the banks consolidated even further since the too big to fail banks were able to aquire the "small enough to fail" banks for huge discounts (because they were going bust).

Nothing says classy like fucking a bimbo pornstar while your wife just gave birth to your youngest son, then bragging about sexually assaulting women because you're a disgusting fat slob.
Best part about Trump supporters is they're generally all unemployable losers that Trump secretly fucking hates. You realize your "god emperor" is disgusted by people that don't own a tux right? He only puts up with trash like you because you get on your knees for him. Notice since he took office he has done nothing but fuck his supporters over.

Tell you what.
I'll bite.
Why do you hate Bernie. Even if you disagree with his political positions surely you can agree that he carries himself ethically compared to most politicians out there, and he is genuine.
I don't agree with John McCain but I respect him for the above reasons.

Almost all economists believe deflation is worse for a currency than inflation.
Good currency incentivizes transactions, if it's deflationary people hold it instead.
Again, the goal of currency is to facilitate frictionless wealth transfer, not be used as an end all be all store of wealth. That said Bitcoin could have properties that still make it a good currency even with this traditional shortcoming.

This is absurd. If your portfolio goes down in market value your wealth drops.

I could see a flash crash if it turns out tether has been artificially pumping the price up. Especially after the bear we're already in.

As if this retard can even read.

Haha I'm well aware but I don't really give a damn about downvotes.

Congratulations, you made money in the greatest bull market of the last century.
Now do that in a mature market like the stock market and I'll be impressed.
