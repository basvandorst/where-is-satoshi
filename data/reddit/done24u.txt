I doubt you can send BTC to PayPal without fees. And also, it's about using crypto and not pos like PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:31:57
Coinbase. If you're still unsure of what to do, always go with Coinbase. It's sort of on the expensive side as fees go, but nothing major. In return you get a pretty reliable exchange.
Then move to their GDAX and buy for free using limit orders. 
To learn about GDAX (a product of Coinbase) watch these really good tutorials:

Isn't a panic sell when you sell because it's falling in price?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:30:38
Agreed. The market cap is far too large for it to go away any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:13:47
If your definition of shit or not shit is the price, then all coins other than BTC are shit. But if BTC crashes real bad, which it still can, will you be calling it shit too? Or are you just another cult follower?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:16:21
Wait, what? I said if you have no fiat for BTC, sell a bit now and buy during the dip.
You are calling me an idiot for allegedly giving wrong advice and try to claim that a dip is not about to happen. The dip happens, proving me right. So then you reply by saying "duh, obviously, everybody knew that".
Okay... I think I'm done here lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:56
All the more coins we can buy in the dip :)

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:05:50
I'm not predicting. I'm just saying that everything sometimes dips. Or drops. Don't know when, don't know for how long. But it will.
Maybe this astronomic rise in the last few days is even down to big players buying up lots and lots only to sell it all after shorting BTC. Thus collecting profits twice.
But noone is predicting, we can all only guess.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:52
Completely agree.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:41:20
Thanks for the fast reply Personthingman2. So transfers would show up on both instances at the same time, being the same wallet on the blockchain, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:35:53
Yeah, everyone else is an idiot... It will dip. And that's perfectly normal and fine. Gives people the chance to buy in. 10000 was like a couple days ago. I am thinking long term.
And time has shown that BTC dips now and then.
I don't get why you need call everyone an idiot. Some people don't know how it works yet and some people panic easily or are not cut out for hodling. Doesn't make them idiots. Why all this aggression? BTC is winning in value like never before right now. Instead spreading hate and insults, spread some positivity!
Edit: the above poster said that they don't have cash to invest in BTC when it dips. That is what I replied to. I am not selling right now in order to buy in the dip. I will just boy more in the dip.

To clarify: small loans = small amounts of cash we loan each other for pizza or something like that. 10 EUR or something like that.

My first contact with BTC was betting on its rise on Plus500. Then I started buying BTC directly at Coinbase/GDAX. So I think it's a good start. Also it raises interest in general. And more interest = more adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:41
I probably would. I am hoping for more of a dip, so I can invest some more fiat. But I feel for you.
It's important to only invest what you can afford to lose.
I am lookin forward to a day when Bitcoin stops being a store of value with owners not wanting to spend it for fear of losing out. That's not what Bitcoin is about to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:09
You really believe that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:57
Sell now and buy during the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:40:08
Time will tell if I was wrong. Not making excuses, making explanations for you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:06:48
I disagree completely. I used to think that Bitcoin would coexist with Bitcoin Cash with Bitcoin being the store of value (like gold) and Bitcoin Cash being, well, cash.
But that will not happen. Something cannot just be a store of value if it has no other value or utility. 
Houses are stores of value, gold is, precious stones, etc. But they all have other utilities. Bitcoin right now is unusable as anything other than storing value.
At some point people will realize this and it will fail. Or it will just slowly be substituted or taken over by Bitcoin Cash, because it is usable, fast and cheap.
I do think that there will be more than one crypto currency 10 years from now. But Bitcoin as it stands now, will not be one of them. Because it's doomed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:38:53
I'm gonna be laughing so hard when BTC drops noticably after futures trading begins. I'll dig that thread up and post there again. Probably get myself banned lol.

The banks will buy into the lightning thing and make money off of BTC. The bigger BTC gets, the sooner banks will get into it and profit from it.

Oh wow, btc is dipping as I said (and that is all I said). So yeah, didn't even take that long.
Let's see how many thousands it goes down. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:30:44
Because I like it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:51:26
My btc is at Coinbase right now (small amount). They charge stupendous fees for small transfers. But this is useful info. That means that once the btc is in my Electrum wallet I can transfer for low fees and so can my friends. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:26:22
In another thread someone wrote that the fork never happened. Don't know how to check though, because I'm a noob. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:20
So the dip is over? Nice to see BCash slowly but surely declining while BTC is going up and up and up. :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:54:30
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:47:59
I registered at Coinbase, then registered at GDAX. I had the option of photographing my ID (they wouldn't allow me to use the ID card (Personalausweis) so I used my passport), but I could also upload a scan. I tried photographing it but it would keep getting declined. So I scanned and uploaded it. Then I had take a photo of my face. Then they said I was declined but accepted me anyway after I logged in the next time. Make sure you use the same address as you do in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:56:47

So it's saying that Bitcoin is either going to go up or go down. Got it. Hodl.

But calling Bitcoin "Bitcoin core" is different?

German institutions are always late to the game. Publishing, music, telecoms and now crypto. They always jump on the train at the last second. As a result Germany is always behind in these fields.

I wouldn't. Maybe it comes soon, maybe it grows to 10000 and then dips to 9000 and you end up buying. 
There is a Chinese saying that is very popular here:

It's a good project and a helpful overview! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:40:28
At first people would simply use their existing saves or security deposit boxes.
But if someone comes up with a business model of storing keys, digital or physical, they would instantly become the number one target for organized crime, hackers, etc.
Maybe banks could be used as secure fortresses for key storage. You know, once they become obsolete. Not just because of bitcoin. People do a lot of their baking online already. And those buildings tend to be built with security in mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:36:33
Looks interesting. Are there going to be more coins added? (XRP, Litecoin, etc.)
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:05:50
I have editted my answer to explain. I still maintain that the Nobel prize in economics is a sham. It's an attempt to pretend that economics is science. It's not. Mathematics are a science.

This is the first time I heard Ver speak. After about 3 minutes I was pretty sure that he is a complete asshole.
What made it definite was when he started saying how rich in fiat money he was. That just totally showed what that guy and his altcoin is all about.
He was also incredibly rude, interrupting every time the interviewer spoke.
And he seems to think that having a lot of fiat makes you a better person or somehow gives you extra dignity or value.
Also what the fuck is up with him calling it Bitcoin Core? It's Bitcoin. As a (totally new) holder of Bitcoin I could also take offense to that and see it as an insult. But I don't. Because I'm not a complete asshole. 
So to recap: I was unsure about Bitcoin Cash. Ver helped me realize that it's a centralized altcoin run by an asshole. All my fiat is controlled by assholes already, so I'm not going to have that with my crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:22:47
Are you saying it's cheaper to transfer to Electrum from GDAX than it is from Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:50:24
Just name them and name percentages so we know what you're taking about. If they take a fee for their service, it's hard to see that as robbery.

No worries. BTG is as dead as anything dead was ever dead. Once it's confirmed dead by a specialist, things will go back to normal at Coinbase.

No bank I know of has problems with transferring to exchanges. Bitstamp uses an Estonian bank for SEPA transfers I think. I don't know why any European bank would not transfer funds to any other European bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:12:35
That was fucking epic man.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:21:20
SEPA can take longer, depending on where they are and where you are. When I make SEPA transfers within my own country, it takes one day max. Any other European country takes a couple days (although I have to admit, I rarely transfer fiat across borders).
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:42:55
That looks like Ver after that interview when he flipped out. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:19:17
I hate when people say stuff like that. When I criticize something that is wrong in my country, some asshole will come along and say (or scream): if you don't like it here, you can just fucking leave!
It's stupid and it helps nothing and noone. I'm pretty sure OP knows that he can take his business elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:59:42
You should try another European country that isn't as strict as Germany when it comes to bank accounts. Try Estonia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, etc.

There is no nobel prize for economics. But please continue.
Edit: I should probably elaborate. The Nobel prize was invented by the Swedish Central bank in the late 60ies. It's to a real Nobel prize as Bcash is to Bitcoin. Not the real deal.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:03:59
Coinbase trades Bitconi Cash? That's news to me. I only see BTC, Ethereum and Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:36:40
A phone is about a million times easier to hack and steal from than Coinbase.
If you just want to HODL, by all means, use a cold wallet like Electrum. But please don't use a phone.
The thing is, you're gonna have to buy your coins somewhere. Most people start off buying at Coinbase. Because it's popular, well documented, trusted and regulated in the US.
And once you've bought at Coinbase or wherever, you will need to transfer the bitcoin to your wallet (of you don't want to keep it at Coinbase), which will incur fees. Which I see as a waste.
If you are looking to invest more than a couple thousand Euros or Pounds, just get a hardware wallet. If not, my advice is leave it on Coinbase or transfer it to GDAX for free and sell when there's a spike or just use GDAX to buy without fees which is also pretty neat. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:15:09
Sorry, I should sleep more lol 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:15:31
It is an original Nobel prize. The Nobel prize for economics was added later by a bank in order to give legitimacy to economics as a science.
Again - just not the real deal. I don't mind prizes for economists, but that's not the Nobel prize because it was invented by a bank. Bcash basically. Invented to make money and to look like the original thing by capitalizing on its brand. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:02:32
At $0.00 :D
Seriously though - no idea. What I'm doing is selling a little during highs and then buying in again during lows. Gives me some profit in fiat and also increases my BTC. Win/win.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:07:36
Try coinmama. They're from Israel (I think) and are more expensive than Coinbase and such, but they don't ask for your ID and stuff. Just buy there and transfer to your own wallet right away.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:13:09
Download a good software wallet like Electrum. Sending BTC is done via addresses. Electrum will let you create an address. It's a looooong string of letters and numbers. You enter that address in Coinbase when promted for an address.
After a while the BTC will show up in your wallet. Don't panic if it takes a while.
When you create your wallet, you will get a list of 12 random words. Write them down. Don't make screenshots, don't type them up. Write them down on a piece of paper with a pen. Don't use a copier to make copies of that word list. Store it somewhere safe and somewhere nobody will find it easily.
If your wallet is lost, you can restore it. To restore it, you need to enter the 12 words you wrote down. All transactions are in the blockchain and you will always be able to restore them while you know the 12 words (seed) in the right order.
Transfer a miniscule amount of BTC to your new wallet. Wait for the payment to go through. Then delete it the wallet. Completely remove it. But write down the 12 words first.
Then reinstall the wallet software and restore your wallet by entering the 12 words. 
That will allow you to be secure in the knowledge that your BTC is in the blockchain and can always be restored as long as you know the seed (12 words). ENJOY!
