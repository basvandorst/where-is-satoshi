Skyhook have the worst customer service of anyone I have dealt with .
I purchased a skyhook a year ago it is now just a paper weight .
I can not get it to connect to the net and I get no response from Jon Hannis or any of the sky hook team when ever I contact them .
If i wasn't in Australia I would go and knock on their door.
This is no way to build a brand and very bad for the bitcoin eco system .
Most of these units are purchased by people who have good intensions of expanding the availability of access points , not with profit intention.
Buyer beware you had better be very tech savy or forget these machines .
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:57:58
If the machine is put out for public use it should be serviced by competent operators. 
Come on guys get it together.
I am testing our machine several times a day I am my own best customer making sure the experience for the real customers is as positive as possible.

Plus future profits on top of that the profits of you're children and future generations .
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:30:02
Should I get out of bed should I have breakfast should I go outside I am sure these along with the questions you asked about bit coin are able to be answered by your self 
The one question you should really ask your self is why do I want to be in bit coin if the answer is just for profit take a deeper look into the real value of this game changing technology and then ask your self why am I so shallow

When the power goes out and the credit card machines don't work you should see the look of horror on the faces of our visitors.

This post is a bit weird  in the body of the article I get ads for a phone company that I recently bought a sim card from.
The report is copied from another post.  
The same headline banner appeared on a post that I responded to that made a whole lot of misleading statements about the shape of Bitcoin in Australia (that post was very quickly removed after my response ).
My feeling is who ever is posting this stuff is saying super positive comments on Bitcoin that are not backed up by substance .
Things that the Bitcoin community would like to hear while using the platform to sell advertising .

@_date: 2014-05-18 23:22:17
Despite all the issues I am glad I purchased mine .
I think Lamassu are well intentioned they offer a vastly better deal for their customers than the main competitors.
Lamassu are developing software to improve the back end interface for the benefit of the owners .
And have also introduced a cash out stand .
I don't think it will be long before they over come the machines operational  issues .
It is exciting to be at the forefront of this amazing technology .
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:51:29
This is a very considered response 
It would be easy to say report them to coin map and lambast the owner 
However I agree there is probably an intention on the owners behalf to accept bit coin
It isn't easy to get listed on coinmap it took my 4 hours of mucking around to find the correct little code 
When I first went on I wasn't quite ready my website was operational and as you said I had to be in the store with my mobile to accept payment in BTC over the counter 
I am now part of a beta test for DCpos a tablet based system 
I also have a coinkite terminal which is easy for the staff to use my website  accepts bit coin for payment
Perhaps a phone call before leaving home to check is in order in the early stages of adoption   
@_date: 2014-04-09 08:26:16
I agree the identity proof and palm scanning etc are total over kill  
In Australia and all financial institutions  need to report on is transactions over $10,000
Seriously if you are going to pull $10,000 out of an ATM or deposit it you probably are dodgey or uneducated 
There are plenty of other options 
The Lamassu is great for purchasing coin but no redeeming cash for your Bitcoin

We have a Lamassu machine installed in our store in Nimbin Australia.
They are in their early stages of development and require constant supervision .There are  number of teething issues which require patience on behalf of the bit coin community .
The guys at Lamassu are very helpful and we have worked through many of the issues since installing our machine 6 months ago 
Interestingly connectivity has not been one of them except when block chain.info goes down.
I understand that there is a backend improvement to functionality coming soon more for the operator rather than the user 
If you have any issues contact Lamassu I am sure they will be pleased to hear from you .
I will also pass this thread on .
Don't give up trying its a brat way to acquire bit coins anonymously.
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:43:21
The uptake on Bitcoin is rather slow I have been asking people as they come into the shop what they know about bit coin
We have young have tourist from around the world and the understanding of the subject is minimal
I expect bit coin usage  will grow over the next few years 
I am in Bitcoin because I believe in the future of crypto currency I want to be geared up to handle the transition and to strengthen my position as an advocate of bit coin
I feel the adoption of bit coin is inhibited by the difficulty of usage it is my aim to make it as easy as possible for my staff and customers 
Back to the original question my holding thus far is minimal I don't expect to generate a great deal of bit coin in the initial stages but my intended management of this new resource will be as follows ;
1 I will save my coins 
2 I will spend my coins when the right opportunity exists
3 I will trade when appropriate with the view of improving my position 
Thanks for your interest

The owner of this unit has a legitimate complaint 
I have owned a Lamassu machine for 6 months .
It requires constant supervision and is operational about 20 percent of the time .
I believe the company is trying to sort out their issues but this post worries me when Lamassu continues to roll out more machines with out fixing the obvious bugs first .
I like Lamassu's business model of selling the machine , the owner then has no residual fee structure on sales of BTC unlike the Robocoin.
Lamassu continues to add features to the soft ware very recently allowing cash out with a new stand .
More effort is required on Lamassu's part to get the existing units working well before going any further .

This article completely overstates the situation of bit coin acceptance in Australia and contains a number of inaccurate statements regarding the location of the first ATMs in Australia .
The Facts are the Lamassu machines were the first to land and they were in Melbourne Nimbin and Perth 
People generally have not much of a clue about what bit coin is  how to acquire it or in fact use it .
Bit average as at today has Australia at .97% of global use that is pathetic  
Most people I talk to are still stuck on the stories of the expensive Pizza ,The guy who lost his hard drive and the hacking of Mt Gox.
We have a very long way to go before we will achieve mainstream adoption . 
If it was possible to ban beer and stop television broadcast of sports the general population might turn on their brains and things would happen .
Until then we will continue to lag behind.

The reference to the variation between the MT Gox price and the rate offered on the machine was a little misleading The owner can set a price referenced by any exchange they choose .
There is also a log on the machine that records all transactions so if there is a mal function this could be sorted out and the customer won't loose their money .
The Lamassu unit is a winner and unlike its competition the vendor owns it and pays zero commission to the supplier of the unit we have one operating in Nimbin NSW Australia

Chargeback is the return of funds to a consumer, mainly used in the United States, forcibly initiated by the issuing bank of the instrument used by a consumer to settle a debt. Specifically, it is the reversal of a prior outbound transfer of funds from a consumer's bank account, line of credit, or credit card.

On the other hand Lamassu are outstanding in their customer service and have addressed any issue I have had with a professional courteous manner and very promptly  .

I am holding off  accepting bitcoin in my bricks and mortar store not because of the confirmation issues I am willing to take the risk on double spend 
What concerns me is having a viable point of sale device that makes it easy for my staff to accept bitcoin 
All that is needed is a calculator that converts fiat to bit coin and produces a QR Code accordingly on a print roll 
I have ordered and paid for a unit from coinkite which does this but it won't be ready to ship until the new year and I don't get much feed back as to how it is going

Bitcoin offers the best of many worlds you can make a speculative  investment very similar to the stock market or currency markets buying and selling when you like with out having to set up accounts with brokers
You can stash cash for a rainy day and not worry about inflation eating away at your savings 
At the same time you can transfer funds around the globe without having to pay ridiculous fees for basic services or risk having your cash or gold stolen or confiscated at borders or during travel 
As a retailer you can accept payments with out having to pay at least 5% of your income to financial institutions for virtually nothing 
Thinking people of the modern world will embrace all of these aspects and support a currency that is of the people and for the people with out government and nationalistic control 
I suggest less concern about a bubble and look towards the longer term whilst enjoying the benefits of a little gamble on the side
