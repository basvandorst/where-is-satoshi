The verification is to use GDAX. That means failed verification will not lock you out of accessing your money as you claim, because without verifying you couldn’t have even put money in.
You don’t have to use SMS for Two-Factor Authentication. That was your own choice. You could have used Google Authenticator, Authy, or something similar.
Also I’m not sure why you were keeping your crypto on there. You shouldn’t leave crypto on an exchange. If you don’t own the private keys, you don’t own the coins.

I'm not sure how you can say someone making a wild bet based on zero data or trends would possibly be a good bet. If you stop basing your analysis on pure opinion then you would have a more compelling argument. And again even if Seg2x wasn't cancelled, it didn't have enough support to surpass previous hard forks that had MUCH more support. Proof of that is the fact that Seg2x didn't happen, with the reason of the cancellation being: NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT. To claim that there would have been a huge influx of support all of a sudden is nonsense.

Not necessarily true. If they were planning on hodling it could go three ways.
1) Invest more, increasing the balance of that wallet (as you said)
2) Invest more, but since they've educated themselves they know that the gift wallet might not be very secure, so they put more in a different wallet (could leave the $100 in the original wallet or move it)
3) Decide to hodl, but not wanting to risk any of their personal finances, only hodl the gifted $100.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:11:12
You example doesn't apply at all. They shorted credit-default-swaps. This guy was long on b2x. They also decided to short based on EVIDENCE they discovered in trends from past data. Like the data I quoted. Everything you've offered has been purely opinions and What-If scenarios.


But this wasn't happening. That was my point. A very small group of people were in favor of seg2x. If there had been a huge support system for it, maybe it could have defied the trends. But there wasn't. Most were against it. Those that placed futures on it did not value the coin as high as this guy. This guy made an outlier bet that was ridiculous. All of the factors I have quoted in my past few comments are things that ACTUALLY happened and could still be used if the hard fork was back on for later this month. Your argument is based on what-if scenarios that weren't the case.

Wow you're pretty salty, going through my comment history :)
Logged out of Coinbase, then uninstalled the app. No way to get back into my account on her phone. I also have two-factor authentication so there's no way to get on my account on any device without first having physical access to my phone, then knowing my phone passcode, then knowing my Coinbase passcode, then knowing my email password to confirm the login. Unlike you, I actually understand how to keep things secure.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:25:23
Personally, I went for the Ledger Nano S. When you set up the device, it provides you with your 24 word seed, and comes with a card to write it down on (if you wish to have a physical copy of the seed). It then has you set a passcode (up to 8 digits). You use the passcode to access your wallet. You can also setup hidden wallets with different passcodes. Most wallet services generate your seed for you.

You're still stuck in your own thought bubble while criticizing others for not breaking out of theirs. So no, you're not understanding. The coin just wasn't going to start at $1k or more. Two other forks is a trend. Both can be used as a speculative basis. Current price doesn't matter that much. What matters is that neither coin STARTED at $1K after the split. The fact that neither has broken $1k ever is just icing on the cake. Seg2x was met with even more resistance than the other hard forks. Those two factors, along with other futures for way lower, is why the coin (if it came to be) would not have started selling at $1K per coin. Meaning that his bet was a not a smart bet, regardless of the coins coming into existence or not.

You're talking about making 3x return on pocket change, and therefore receiving pocket change. This guy didn't bet pocket change, he bet $1000/coin. None of the other hard forks of Bitcoin (BCH, BTG) have ever reached $1000. What exactly makes you think it's a smart idea to pay that much per coin even if there wasn't any risk of the hard fork not happening (which there wasn't)?

You're not understanding my point at all. The price is the ONLY thing that matters. I'm not claiming it was bad because Seg2x didn't happen, I'm claiming it was bad because he bet waaay too much per coin. I'll say it one more time for you. Had Seg2x gone through, it STILL would have been a bad bet because he greatly overvalued the coin. Previous hard forks have never reached $1000 per coin and the coins would have been sold on exchanges for way cheaper. It has nothing to do with hindsight. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to type up this same comment a third time if you still do not understand after reading this.

Finally I decided to take the plunge in September and went with Coinbase because they were the easiest. Going forward however I will be using other wallets and exchanges for the reasons I stated above. This subreddit can be a good resource for information sometimes. There's also some good sites dedicated to bitcoin and some irc channels where people may be able to help out with any questions you may have. Best of luck!

If you're referring to the Ledger Nano S, the whole point of a HW wallet is ultimate security. Why run the risk of compromising that security by buying from a third-party on Amazon? Better to buy direct from the manufacturer and wait longer, to ensure no tampering has been done to the wallet.

Yeah I felt it was more secure to buy direct from the manufacturer rather than a reseller. The integrity of the Ledger is checked each time you turn on the Ledger, and they claim it's tamper-proof. But I just felt that it was best to buy direct. Didn't seem any crazier to me than people that generate paper wallets in VMs, even if their PC is not connected to any network. Peace of mind is sometimes worth the extra money.

Is there a better exchange with lower fees where I can put the coins directly in my paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:54:48
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:37:28
OP here. I used Coinbase because I was just starting in Crypto and it was the most straightforward way to purchase with relatively low fees. However it is not a good idea to keep your crypto with a third-party, especially one that doesn't give you control over the private keys. I purchased a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet last night. Hardware wallets are a great solution, especially if you are dealing with multiple cryptocurrencies. If you're just dealing with BTC, a software wallet or paper wallet might be better as they're free. I will be moving my BTC into a paper wallet in preparation of the hardfork (if you don't control your private key you don't control your coins!), and then moving from the paper wallet to the hardware wallet when I receive it. If you decide to go with a paper wallet, make sure you download the wallet generator and then disconnect from the internet BEFORE creating a wallet. Even better if you do it in a VM. I will still keep the Coinbase application on my phone so I receive price notifications, but I have been looking for a comparable alternative to purchase Bitcoin elsewhere. Someone else in the comments here suggested localbitcoins.com, so I may be giving that a try when I'm ready to purchase again.

If you bought the BTC when it was say around $2000 USD, sure you're technically getting a discount on any purchases. But then to replenish what you spent you have to buy at the current price of ~$4400 USD, nullifying any discounts received. By just hodl-ing and spending fiat instead, you could maximize profits on the BTC that you initially bought for $2000 USD.

I have it set up the same way as u/Pink-Fish. I used the Coinbase app to do so. The only downside is that you have to wait for Bitcoin to reach certain prices before you can set up the alert. For example I cannot set up an alert that will trigger if Bitcoin dips below 6k, because the current price is not above 6k. But once you set the alerts once, they will stay until you delete them.

It works the same way that it would if you transfer to any other wallet or make a purchase (which is essentially just transferring to another wallet). For specifics to Coinbase: 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:12:21
You probably misread my comment. You cannot set an alert for below a price if the price is not currently above that price. For instance, if you were to scroll to 6k right now, it would only let you set a price alert for BTC going ABOVE 6k. If you want to set an alert for BTC going BELOW 6k, the price has to already be above 6k.

You could buy more to have the same amount, but if the price has spiked up when you go to buy more, then you may end up spending more money than you would have with fiat. Especially if you had exchanged for the bitcoin a while ago when it was way cheaper. I'm fine with promoting bitcoin as a utility/currency, but until it becomes less volatile, most will just view it as an investment.

You could have a high-tier GPU and you still wouldn't have a fighting chance. Bitcoin mining has evolved from GPU mining to specialized hardware called ASIC miners.

You mock about PCs being compromised, but why do you think people run software related to bitcoin and altcoins in VMs? If you're investing a lot of money, and you are your own "bank", you take all the security precautions you can with no compromises. Otherwise what is the point in the first place. Also as long as you have control of your private keys you can take advantage of the hard fork. So a paper wallet will be good.

Wouldn't spending fiat be maximizing the profit though? If you bought it for much cheaper a while ago and spend it now when it's higher, sure you are spending less. But then to replenish it now when it's higher, I feel that it might be more cost efficient to just spend fiat.
