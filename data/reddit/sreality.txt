I use paypal4u on bitmit, or pepinw on local bitcoins.com in Canada. He's easy to deal with and the PayPal is fast from your btc.

you cant run bitcoind on your server?
Perhaps I can provide you with a server (or at least some of its resources) to help you make a couple BTC gambling games.
What do you think?

depending on where you live, try visiting your local satoshi square meetup, if you dont find someone who has on site, you're probably 1 step closer to meeting them through there.

I am a full time PayPal seller (albeit not bitcoin, but a similar risk profile). --- after 2 years of this I learned that 85% of customers/transactions are straight. But there is that 15% which includes buyers remorse, and the 3-5% of just malicious fraud (aka friendly fraud -- google this)
Still... PayPal opens doors and you will make loot. Just make sure your margin is at least 10% (+3% pp business fee)

I think there's some truth to the NSA=satoshi idea, except I figure its more about making it easier to follow the money.
my 5c says theres lots of financial international institutions that dont play ball with the NSA or other agencies, like a cash blackhole.
with btc adoption, you could sniff the economy at all levels, from person to person, all the way up to the worlds richest folks, etc.
