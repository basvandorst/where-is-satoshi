A great analysis! 
However, I didn't see anything about ICO's - don't underestimate their profitability, as they have proved to be quite efficient. For this to happen, one needs to read a lot, plan ahead, invest and HODL - as with any other coin.
For example, I'm considering investing in an upcoming ICO known as Giftz, thanks to their partnership with BlockV. Once this is done, I will simply HODL and pray for the best. Another profitable option of mine would be Cointed - a very promising ICO in terms of ROI :)

This is immensely a lot. What do you think that they will do with them? Since the price has fallen, do you think that they will HODL until it reaches up once again?

By definition, a statement without facts becomes an opinion, rather than an argument. And, without any intentions to apologize, I couldn't care enough of your opinion. I'm buttressing what you stated above about uninformed people taking actions into something they do not understand and also ask something which is of my particular interest - the sole idea of such threads. And here you are, posting laconic and devoid-of-meaning comments. If you do not have any ACTUAL comments on this, consider abstaining from commenting.

It's a rational behavior of people to panic and raise tumult when they believe that their investments are threatened, in a way. Nevertheless, I believe that they shouldn't worry. The predictions are that Bitcoin will continue rising even after, which speaks positively for prospective followers of the coin.

I can strongly relate - that's basically my story in a nutshell (with slight variations, tho). I, however, focused harder on ETH, IOTA and LTC, rather than on BTC. However, I need to be rational and to know that BTC also has a huge potential, regardless of its price drop, thus, I might take advantage of the low price now and just hodl in future.

I just read that BTC fell to $15,000. Do you know anything about this? If this is so, what do you believe would be the most efficient and profitable move?

To be honest, I believe that regardless of possible price fluctuations, BTC will prevail as a cryptocurrency in the long-run. This is due to the fact that it is stable an a lot of people have faith in it - it is based on people's faith, thus, as long as this stays up, the future of the coin will be possible. Nevertheless, it is not the only one, nor it is my favorite - I personally prefer ETH, however, I need to stay objective and to speculate that the future of BTC is bright.

For all ICO traders - can somebody provide me with more information regarding these projects: Cointed (cointed.com), Giftz (giftz.io), and AgroTechFarm ( They all seem very promising to me but I am still collecting opinions on their long-term profitability &amp; stability.
