If it had an option for deterministic keys using a seed password, that would be great

I think the alt coins would be expensive for the end customer due to low volume at first. As a currency, people would normally use what is cheaper for them. I don't see people running away from bitcoin. If they saw something obscure like mincoin, I think they'll try to keep their money safe(r) with bitcoin. People in the world use the dollar as a backup currency despite the variety available (Zimbabwe). To be honest, I'd hope this would end some alt war battles and show how they fare in the merchant market.sink or swim. They should sink for the most part and hopefully people will stop making so many of them.

Aww, nae good man! Should be advertised all over!

the majority of people with bitcoin have lost bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:48:00
Robustness is the ability to handle errors and incorrect inputs. Bitcoin is having problems downloading the blockchain. Given my lack of Linux expertise, I'd say I'm probably giving some bad input somewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:05:35
Not the typical user, no. But your advice is reasonably good and incredibly familiar. You haven't hacked me, right?
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:12:27
Then I wake up

Are withdrawals manually done by gox or is the delay intentional for some reason? It is nearly a 10% gain. It'll attract big money for arbitrage even if the delay takes a week. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:57:54
I accept bitcoin from people who want to test transactions. Also as donations buy I have a processing fee for that.
@_date: 2013-08-21 04:16:43
Malicious link?
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:42:47
I'll jump to litecoin when that happens
@_date: 2013-10-19 21:48:21
I'm selling for only $9,000 so buy from me to make an easy grand!
@_date: 2013-08-09 00:58:31
If they make such a major change to bitcoin, a billion dollar market, I guarantee volatility. It'll be tested on alt coins first.
Edit. Zerocoin developers deem it more likely to be used in alt coins than bitcoin... 
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:37:44
Buy a member of the bitcoin dev team a coffee
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:57:15
I guess it would make some people switch to bitcoin

Asics are not as likely to dwarf computer's hash power with scrypt compared to sha. It is based on ram

Can it connect to a merchant's website?
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:59:15
Anywhere to sponsor it as a project and accept donations?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:19:08
I believe in what you are saying.
Just buy bitcoin and buy stuff with it. The market will follow. If you have a business, accept bitcoin. If you think if an idea to use bitcoin, work on it or promote it to others.
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:12:30
The end of the bitcoin is nigh right before I need to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin to the moon whenever I need to sell.
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:41:53
I'm just meh
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:33:35
Wow, that's terrible. Being given currency that increased several fold over the past year, man, that's tough. You don't need to use them, most Christmas gifts suck and get thrown out. Bitcoin could gain in value so put it somewhere until it gains enough that you get off your lazy ass and use them. Your girlfriend is likely the one who was embarrassed. How the hell would you find it embarrassing that someone's brother handed them out? I get lots of crap at Christmas that gets thrown out. At least with bitcoin I can buy stuff or get a gift card with it real easy using a smartphone app. If it is beyond you, hell, you could give that bitcoin to someone for a cash exchange.
You are a douchebag and a serious dick. Fuck you.
I don't like apple but if someone gave me $20 of shares for apple I'd still be happy. What about gold or platinum?
Dude, I got silicone cooking stuff for Christmas.
And if you are just pissed because the guy was overenthusiastic about his bitcoin gift, ignore it. There isn't enough enthusiasm in the world about positive things and the potential for bitcoin to help the poor is massive.

Decentralized internet. Hide data with redundant overheads. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:28:07
Yes, I'm aware of the mechanism, but what made you look? Do people monitor certain addresses or just randomly check?
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:01:45
0.5% fees? Who cares fit a currency exchange? The important thing is what their margin is in the exchange rate they give you.

Still beats the hell out the Zimbabwe dollar. Paypal uses dollars. Bitcoin is a new currency.

if only it could automate transactions. if only it could move fiat at the rate of bitcoin. if only it could get a dime out of mt gox.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:42:54
How do you notice?
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:46:13
I'll buy with bitcoin. Give me opportunity.

Bring a small economy compared to bitcoin doesn't seem like an issue. The service could charge a big markup for a lack of liquidity. It seems like it would open up the market.

Downvoting to obscurity... ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:06:31
Because they sold already
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:50:39
But I'm broke. I'd never sell the rock! It is too precious to me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:57:11
It didn't stay at$50 much. Wouldn't say it corrected to that. Wasn't it more$120 it suck to?
@_date: 2013-07-28 01:50:26
That won't boost adoption of the currency. I'm not talking about my personal needs. I'm referring to providing a tool to let people buy things online and provide the merchant with money in his currency of choice without risk to him. The aim is to boost adoption of the currency.
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:35:45
Heck yes
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:17:02
I'm returning the rock as soon as I can find the gift receipt he gave me.

I wouldn't invest right now, wait until it hits $700.
@_date: 2013-07-29 14:02:21
I doubt the volume would be large for alt coins and the markup would be used to offset the risk. The hash rate of the network could be checked for suspicion of an attack and suspension of operation with a currency could be an option temporarily. E.g the recent attack on terracoin.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:03:07
Wow. Btc is a big deal.

I now need to get dollars from somewhere to pay taxes?

Bitcoin won't get scrypt. Bitcoin hash power will always be with asics.

Crazy bubble in April? I bought all the way up to 180+. Sold at 190 during the crazy oscillations during the collapse. Lucky I was able to do that it happened so fast.
Also bought after silk road news dip in price.

If think if isps blocked the bitcoin protocol, people would find a way to reroute the data so the isp wouldn't know. E.g different port.

Recipient needs to use a new address per customer or transaction so that receiving funds can be said to be from my transaction. Otherwise they could claim received funds came from someone else for something else. There is no linkage to a transaction from my address. The values and timing could be considered circumstantial. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:44:14
Admittedly my check hasn't cleared but only sent a few days ago. By tough do you mean there are delays above a couple weeks? Because mt gox is horrific as far as I hear.

it's ok.my concern with asics is the ability of a wealthy interested party to manipulate the network with a high hash rate.

I agree with his post except wonder about peercoin.

Dumb. Credit card gives protection. Spend only what you have and pay in full and there is no interest. And choose a card with no annual fees.
