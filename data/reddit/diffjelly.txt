Yay, another useless study where they grasp at straws to try and act like they are in the know and give the guise provide vital information to the country so as to make people they can't live without them.
I'm expecting "the crypto market crash caused lots of people to lose money".

Gubement doesn't want you to realize you can live without them over your shoulder.

Well the number you made up as made up as the numbers I'll come up for the cost of all of that. All of that incoming supply would cause the price to go down aoo...not as profitable as you think, maybe in the very short tern.

You do realize it has to be profitable to mine from that asteroid or its not going to be done? The Earth is practically abundant in gold in the deeper layers and crust but we don't and likely never will have the technology to go that far down as our tools will melt, or that isn't cost effective enough so for us its still rare
There was a big boom during the industrial age in terms of gold mining, I think something like 70% of all gold mined was done so the last 200 years. Yet gold has still kept its value and the total amount of gold mined can fit under the eifel tower. Also, speculative value in gold...lol. Part of the reason is governments keep on printing decade after decade. We still dont know if Bitcoin can succeed its a project, with each halving we will be more or less confident depending on the outcome and hopefully we get LN more polished.

You dont need empirical evidence to prove this. Just common sense. we were under a gold standard when we achieved the industrial revolution...that should not have been possible with how bad mouthed gold backed currency is.

Gold is to preserve your wealth. Let's say you are 68, you've worked hard, made as much as you think you will, and you want to park your hard earned money into something that survives crashing economies and currency replacements...where do you put your money? Gold. Economies can crash, if you owned only stocks and those businesses fail, you're outta luck. If you owned government bonds or currency, and the currency experiences hyper inflation and is no longer used, you're outta luck. But no matter how many new economies are formed, no matter how many new paper currencies are introduced, gold will have a measurement in each one and can be exchanged for each one.
So when you're old and want to preserve what you worked hard for to pass it down to your family, you buy some gold.

Gold is deflationary. There is a fixed amount of gold on Earth, it's not that we are "finding" more gold, we are finding more gold mines but the gold was always there. No new gold is being made, we are simply  pulling it out from the ground and now able to use it. What happens is that there IS a lot of gold in the sense that we keep finding more, but the amount we find per year is not a lot, it's something like 1-2% of the supply and still fits under the Eiffel tower because gold is very dense so you can do a lot of things with a very tiny amount. Relative to silver, copper, iron, and oil...it is pretty rare.
It is differen't than Bitcoin though. Never in the history of mankind have we had a completely finite commodity. If you count Bitcoin as a commodity (I do), then it is the first of its kind and we have never experienced a truly fixed commodity, though we know close enough from gold that it leads to deflation.

Doesn't this mean states are violating section 10 because they accept paper notes for payment of debts (taxes)? I know practically it may not be a big deal but I am just askikg purely technical
Also since you are here I'd like to ask about IRS code. In the IRS code it defines property as "includes services and the right to use property, but such term does not include money.". Do you happen to know what their interpretation of money is? It certainly can't be gold and silver as they claim that as property/collectibles....could just be US dollars, I am wondering if crypto currencies could technically be exempt. In the 2014 crypto currency notice they provided, they talk about real currency and virtual currency, so I guess crypto currencies would NOT count as money? But they dont treat crypto currencies as currency rather as property...so again what exactly do they mean?

A 1oz gold coin would buy a Roman a toga. Today, a 1oz gold coin buys you a suit.
A quarter made in 1900s (which had silver in it) would buy you a gallon of gas (25 cents at the time). Today, that same silver quarter would get you $3.92, enough to buy a gallon of gas and then some.

Preserving wealth and accumulating wealth are two different things. If you want to preserve what you already have, you buy gold. If you want to make more, you buy gold stocks (as an example). Gold fluctuates a lot in nominal value in 5 year periods, but over 10 or more years it generally has a higher nominal value and keeps its purchasing power.

Back when we had kings, the kings confused the common folk proclaiming they had the right to the throne because God said so. How did they prove that it was from God? Well they had a crown made of gold, gold so shiny and never deteroritates like nothing else in the world, its unexplainable, so must be from god. That's probabaly how it played out.

If we can make gold so cheaply dont you think we would have other technology that would find a rarer precious metal? Palladium was discovered only in 1802, whereas gold was found practically since beginning of ancient civilizations.
Even if you find a bunch of asteroids of gold in space, it still needs to be profitable to mine that gold or else it won't be mined. The earth itself basically has an abundance of gold in the crust and further down but we dont have the technology to extract it (and probabaly never will as the temperatures are far too hot) nor is it profitable to do, so for all intents and purposes gold is still considered rare.

My analysis is 10 months after the halving and if you look at each halving its taken a few more months longer each time. The full effects of the halving were experienced in December 2017, so the bull market lasted for 2 years. However the beginning effects were as early as May 2017. The last halving was July 2016.  So July 2016 to May 2017 is 10 months.

Just wondering, it's no different than understanding the constitution?

Something current PoS implementations can't handle if I am not mistaken.

How do you expect to buy if nobody is selling?
