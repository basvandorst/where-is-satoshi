I get that. What I don't get is why I'm getting transaction and balance from my old mycelium wallet, and not my current breadwallet's balance and history.

I think I got it. Both apps used the same phrase, but a different derivation that landed on two different keys.
When I installed breadwallet, I must have tried to restore the original wallet with the same pass phrase, but I landed on a different private key and I had to transfer the bitcoin through a transaction. Now I have successfully imported the breadwallet pass phrase in electrum by specifying the m/0' derivation.

Who knows ? My understanding is that it will reduce fees, but that's not the only reason users hoard their coins. Spending bitcoin feels like cheating your future self out of value.

I timed the market at 0.2 by accident as I just waited for breadwallet to update with the bitcoin cash send off feature. 
That was a sweat deal!

The price you buy in only matters relative to the price you sell out. It's not really cheap or expensive, the only questions are will it rise higher, and when.

The seed is a series of words that you can use to restore your wallet and its attached bitcoin balance on another device or app.

I just dumped my bitcoin cash on kraken (after maybe 25 Error 520 and other "service anavailable at the moment, please try again later") in celebration!  
Couldn't get around to doing it earlier because vacations on the French Riviera without my laptop was a thing.

What if you're just fudding around?
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:55:13
That would be like any transfer from adress to adress, yes there would be a fee.

I got there back in the end of May, and bought the last piece when the rate was 2100$, which made me nervous. ��
Take care of your private key, and see you on the moon!

All Time High. 
Hodl is a meme based on a typo. Just keep your coins, price can fall and rise, but selling is cheating your future self. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:13:25
Thanks. That was a poor piece of UI design.

That's not what a strong currency means. It's about how its change rate relative to other currencies evolves over time. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:33:01
There's a pin on the device though.

Bitcoin is highly divisible, up to the eighth decimal, unlike fiat currencies that only divide by a factor of 100. 
The smallest unit is called a satoshi, as a nod to bitcoins pseudonymous creator(s).

There is a good chance bitcoin remains mostly a store of value, and never becomes an everyday use currency simply because it's much more interesting to hold it than to spend it. And that's fine.

I sold mine at kraken back in the days. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:31:23
I have one but can't use it on usb3 on any of my PCs. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:01:27
It's simply amazing. Now nothing can stop it!
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:59:44
It's worse because r btc describes itself as a place to discuss bitcoin but its content is mostly anti bitcoin and pro alt coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:02:48
Got to multiply my btc by 1.2, not a bad trade. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:47:20
Come on, a 10 times increase in not [exponential]( it's merely [geometric](

Maybe you should try to argue without using false dichotomies and strawman fallacies. 
Socializing some aspects of life such as healthcare is not communism. 
Being left leaning does not make me a communist. 
Besides, I enjoy bitcoin and there's nothing you can do about it. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:53:10
Some stuff like defense, healthcare, education work best when socialized. 
It doesn't mean everything does. But it means paying taxes is a good thing.

My banker just told me he hated bitcoin. I had no further questions.

I donate monthly to provide free food to homeless people that need it because it's better for them than having to beg in the streets. 
Libertarianism is a very simplistic world view and leads to inefficient and cruel policies.

It's supposes to go from dumb to genius, but is sometimes reversed for pseudo comical effect.

Send all your coins from coinbase to your mycelium wallet (hit send one one side and copy/paste the address you get when you press receive on the other side). 
On mobile you can copy and paste your receiving public address to make it easy. 
If you use coinbase on desktop, you can telegram your receiving address to yourself.

I think it's a typo that became a meme in the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:07:48
That's what was suggested indeed. But the price might rise instead. Who knows?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:23:07
You can hold and buy at the same time…
