There is no sense in all this negative speculations. In the contrary, it can even make additional damage with all this panic evolving.  They have written on bitstamp.net that they are working the matters out and that all customer acount balances will be honored in full. I cannot understand why so many of you think anybody is making false statements or wants to lie to anybody.
What is written there is binding for them also in any case and as such they probably would rather post nothing than to make such a strong statement.
You all seem to read only what you want to read. Just let the guys finish. 
The worst thing would be to set up the system online with the same "hack bug" again. So rather give them the time.  
We all want crypto? Lets stay professional. It was born. This guys also helped.  Now we have to go over childhood illnesses. There will be many other. After that it can grow.

Customer service is perfect from my experience. 
No body is hidding behind Slo laws...this might be even harder in such cases. 
What you explain as good service when you lost your codes from other exchanges is in my eyes bad service, as they actually should and must complicate the recovering process...your fault was to loose the codes, to obtain back access easy for you, might the next time also be same for others to get access to your account.
ETA of the service is today, and I trust the guys to be back soon.
