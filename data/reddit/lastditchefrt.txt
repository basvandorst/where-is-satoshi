@_date: 2017-12-27 16:36:05
Dont be a dick.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:06
I agree. I am sure they are making a killing right now in transaction fees and yet they cant host a few additional servers from a cloud provider to handle temp increase in load.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:04
Every time i refresh gdax we lose 1k.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:35
Huff post is trash....
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:21:14
So basically pissed away 5 million....
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:13
Dude I dont think anyone has higher available bandwidth for their site than Gdax. That being said it doesnt appear they have anyone over there that knows how to scale with load.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:37
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:08:06
Dumped it the second i got it at 3600.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:12
And.... gdax is down.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:48:10
100 btc is nothing....
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:42
Running to taco hell for lunch, I have a feeling this lunch run is gonna cost me a few k if gdax comes back up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:45
what the fuck.... almost 19k
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:05:49
How bout we actually open it up to free marlet rather than crony capitalism?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:19:38
And thinks free markets means regulated.....
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:03:43
Is gdax slow as hell for everyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:00:36
Howd thst government regulated monopoly work out so far? Answer to government regulation is more regulation? Who let the liberals in here?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:52
