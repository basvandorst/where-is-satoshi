Gavin, you probably don't remember me. I had doubts about your leadership(and your person) before, but now I think that your way is the way to go.&amp;nbsp;
At this point I am almost certain that "the lighting guys" are sabotaging Bitcoin. The question is - do they do it just for personal profit, or do they have some deeper (darker) agenda ? &amp;nbsp;
I think that, if consensus cannot be reached, you need to fork the shit out of Bitcoin. I think that at least 80% of miners and full nodes will follow you. I certainly will.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:57:36


Agreed, this is why i think that **stealth addresses** should be the standard for earning BTC this way. Without it, it doesn't make a lot of sense for most of today's BitTorrent usage.

Actually, I already pay fees 10 times smaller than "normal" using my soft-fork.
The transactions confirm much slower obviously (6 confs may take several hours), but it works.

Don't be like that. Begging for bitcoin acceptance is like begging for pennies in the street. It puts you in bad position.
Nobody is going to take people here seriously if they behave like this. 
Its not that i don't like the idea of STEAM + BTC. I simply believe that posts like this will only make matters worse, not better.
Man, paying Steam in Bitcoin would make my life so much easier.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:52:04
When both block size and TX fee adjust automatically based on an algorithm, there will be no need for limiting usage of Bitcoin to bigger transactions.
The free market will auto-regulate what transaction fees are proper, what is the minimum  cost-effective amount to send and what blocksize is necessary.
Not saying that it is easy to do though...

I think that the real rulers of the world (those invisible hidden behind curtains) are simply preparing for their endgame. They are not stupid, they know what is going to happen.
What is the endgame exactly is uncertain, but probably involves complete destruction of current system and introduction of new, terrible, totalitarian and/or orwellian system, now with even more slavery.
I hope that Bitcoin seriously messes with their plans and perhaps even will bring us true freedom. Internet probably already changed the game, as they did not expect it or underestimated its influence - proof:

That DDoS argument is complete bullshit.
If it was easier to DDoS Bitcoin then somebody would have done it when blocks were on average 100KiB. Why were there no successfull DDoS attacks when blocks were only 100KiB ? This DDoS argument is completely senseless.
The situation today == the situation when average block was 50 KB. &amp;nbsp;
The same RELATIVE suspectability to DDoS attacks.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:38:00


Been there, done that.
Noooope. Does not work. But feel free to try yourself.
You can test that easily
* 1. send little coins (for example: 0.01) to you with normal fee
* 2. wait for 6 confirmations
* 3. Now try to resend them to another addr WITHOUT a fee
* 4. Bitcoin-QT will not let you resend them without a fee. My fork will

But does GBT really solve 51%-pool problem ?
What if miners are on (for example) GHash will only see the blocks GHASH wants them to see (those double spending blocks) ? Won't this destroy the effectiveness of GetBlockTemplate ?

Oh, we just need to invent FTL communication systems. No problem there ;)
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:52:15
Specifically, I didn't say it solves 51% problem. I said it solves the **current 51% crisis**.
Getblocktemplate does not allow a pool operator to easily execute 51% attack.

Why are you pursuing this broken line of thinking ?&amp;nbsp;
It's obvious AMT cannot use drives when power is OFF. But the AMT has power, so it can install rootkit which will activate later when you start your computer.
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:58:00
Are you kidding or what ? It has everything to do with Bitcoin.
People store Bitcoins on their computers, of which a lot is INTEL-based.
I personally consider going all-AMD after this.
Also, most of web servers which run Bitcoin markets are based on Intel CPUs and Motherboards. This is another possible attack vector.
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:03:03
AMD (to my knowledge) does not have anything of this complexity level built in.
So maybe buy AMD instead ?

Wake on lan is one thing. Running JAVA code when power is off is another thing.

You can reflash BIOS (and probably UEFI). You cannot reflash AMT. You don't have access to AMT. You don't have keys to AMT. AMT does what Intel wants, not what you want. &amp;nbsp;
It's like your computer is no longer yours to control, frankly. &amp;nbsp;
Fuck this, Stallman was right all the way. Again.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:29:51
"Conspiracy" would assume that it is merely a suspiction of being real. That is not the case here. **This shit is as real as it gets.** &amp;nbsp;
As for AMD, even if it is not completely clean, its backdoor is nowehere near the level of complexity of Intel's. &amp;nbsp;
Intel has been on it for like 15 years (most of the time together with Microsoft). Google: TCPA, Palladium
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:10:15
There is electricity running through the AMT module even when computer is OFF.&amp;nbsp;
AMT could activate power-on-lan.
Also, it can actually boot your computer.&amp;nbsp;
This thing has more control over your machine than BIOS/UEFI itself.

Why don't you guys also engrave all the black points of QR code 2 mm deep in the metal ?
Then it should endure any kind of fire (as long as the metal does not turn to liquid).

Nope, this is a soft-fork, which means it will not cause chain splits.

Or perhaps simply do not use the same browser for Facebook and other things ? This way Facebook has no way of tracking your browsing activity.&amp;nbsp;
The days I used Facebook i had a completely separate browser profile for it, so it had nothing to do with other parts of my life. But you can do even better - configure a proxy in the browser you are using FB on, so it doesn't even know your normal IP.&amp;nbsp;
Now i simply do not use Facebook anymore as after last terms update they effectively own your ass and can do whatever they please with your data &amp; your photos.

Bill gates, similarly to Jobs, hasn't really done much innovating anyway. He mostly ripped off somebody else's ideas and used them to make tons of money.&amp;nbsp;
And I am not even mentioning the patent trolling his company has done... World may have been a better place with no Microsoft and no Bill Gates.
