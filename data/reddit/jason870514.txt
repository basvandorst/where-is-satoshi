A lot of retailers here in Germany don't accept credit cards due to these high fees, might be simpler here because for historical reasons, debit cards are much more common, and many Germans still use to pay in cash. But profit margins especially for grocery discounters are below 1%, so no chance to pay 3% fees to the credit card company.

Honestly I don't tell anyone my credit card PIN, are you doing that? You give your card details and the CVV but you have the right to take back your payment if you doubt it.

Your money isn't gone, it just belongs to other people now.

If you believe it, just bet on it.

Surely it's possible, mathematically it's similar to when you hit the jackpot in a lottery to win millions. Very unlikely but it happens all the time (however to very few players compared to the total number of them)

Basically his mistake was not to make the mistake which is not considered a mistake any more.

Of course not all "Asians" look the same, but when you get to know a lot of Chinese people at the same time, you are insecure in the first place and you quickly need to improve your face recognition patterns to know who is actually who. 
Working in Germany, I was just doing a project in China.
My recommendation is, don't imply racism when there is none.

Ok I thought this can have a good end but it doesn't. You imply I'm racist because you are racist. I explained three times what actually happens in the brain but you want it to be a racist comment so you just invent the racism in it.
Guys like you are creating racism in the end because you are shouting "racism" all the time and you don't see in time when you're losing the respect of those people who would have been on your side and you're still blaming them for something they didn't do actually.
I'm working with a lot of different nations in my company, guess I can handle international communications properly.
You can stay in your corner and cry that everybody is racist even when they are not, and it is you who is pathetic in the end, not me. I stop here, not interested in another racism-implying answer from a hysterical guy like you. Go away.

Just to give you a serious answer, I was working with Chinese guys on a project in China and my ability to see the differences in their faces was getting better every day. I guess our internal "face recognition algorithm" is optimized for Caucasians but it can extend to other races, just like learning a new language.

Gold has been used for jewelry, art and cultic items for more than 3,500 years due to its unique features, its intrinsic value wasn't invented by the electronics industry. For the above uses, gold is irreplaceable without changing the result completely. Silver, copper and platinum might be close but are obviously different in color and behavior.

Are you *actually* asking whether in the biggest worldwide crisis ever, with massive issues regarding basic electricity supply among thousands of other serious life-threatening issues, a virtual internet-based asset depending on a distributed network which must run with lots of electrical power will be the solution to think of in the first place?

Bitcoin can handle 600k transactions / day, this became an issue or at least a perceived issue during the hype phase. Since the price was rising quickly, people wanted to be part of the game immediately, actually "FOMO" - this is pulling up the fees of course, if you're expecting the price to rise hundreds of dollars within the next few hours, you wouldn't care so much about a 40 dollars fee.

Not true, you would have the same issue with black people or Latin American natives. And I am quite sure that they have the same issues in distinguishing our long noses and pale skins. It was the Chinese kids in the cities running after us because they had never seen a European face before. And I'm not working for Asians. I notice your passive aggressiveness but I cannot see where my comment would be racist anyhow, maybe this is what you just want to read because you are secretly racist yourself.
