scientific notation.

Yeah true. Scientific is subcategory of floating with base==10.

Some people don't enjoy the idea of bagholding for years. Better to jump out while market sentiment is shitty

Exactly, they set a floor and let you lock in profits. If you believe a certain support level shouldn't be broken and then it does, your thesis may have just changed . The alternative, which I guess many people here do, is just to stare at the prices 24/7 and continually monitor and reanalyze. Which one sounds morw efficient? Lol

Yrah but hodlers hold the majority of bitcoin now. Their cost basis is obviously lower than the current price, so you shouldn't be looking at it from a percent perspective. Going from 2000x to 1000x stings a lot more than going from 2x to 1x

Still thinking 100k?

Coin valuations are highly correlated. If btc goes to 100k, I would expect the prices of the top 20 or so alt coins to rise a similar level (give or take) . That would represent a total mkt cap similar to gold. Further, I think judging value creation on a percent basis like you do is highly suspect. You would be a fool to bet that AAPL stock in next 20 yrs will  rise 100x since it did so in the last 20 years (if AAPL is worth $80 trillion in 20 years then I guess I'll eat my shoe) . There are carrying capacity factors involved and you can't expect returns to replicate at the scales btc/crypto now operate at.
IMO, the best thing for the crypto space at this point is a stabilization of prices and a consolidation of offerings. Until then, widespread practical adoption will remain a struggle.

I meant I would be willing to take 1:10 odds that it doesn't hit 100k. At this point, it's probably closer to 1:100. 100k would mean a mkt cap higher than gold. That kind of valuation increase that shortly just seems ridiculous.

This video has lost people so much money during this current crash lol. No reason to not sell out and then jump back in lower instead of bagholding the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:10:03
I would give you 10:1 odds that happens. Some of y'all are delusional
