I think it's great and might pick one up.  It'll go great with my sterling silver bitcoin pin :)

Hey thanks DevTheDevBTC :)
It's always humbling when somebody likes your stuff.

They allow you to use bitpay or coinbase as a payment processor.  Both of which allow you to keep the bitcoins or have them auto-converted to fiat.  I personally keep all the bitcoins as bitcoins when paid in bitcoin on my shopify store.

This should help you figure out how many hashes you can do with your hardware.
You'll need about 2150 Mhs to make 1 bitcoin per day at current difficulty.  The amount needed will continue to rise.  If ASICS are released that amount will shoot up multiple times what it is now.  BFL states they are scheduled to release in October but who knows.   Somewhere around the beginning of December the rewards will half so it'll double at that point as well.
Remember though, this is running your card at 100% 24/7.  This will cost you in electricity and reduce the life of your video cards.  Lots of miners undervolt and underclock their cards just to get more life out of them but at this point with ASICS coming out that might not be the wisest course of action.
Not trying to persuade you not to do it... just you should know what you're getting into.

If you moved from a previous client to 0.8 then it creates hard links to some files for backwards compatibility reasons I believe.  This causes it to look like it's taking up more space on the hard drive than it actually is when you look using the normal tools.
If you want it to look cleaner you could always save your wallet.dat file and start fresh with 0.8.  There is probably also some safe way to just delete some of the files but I'm not sure.  You could research this some.  It's probably answered on the forums somewhere or you could try to get a hold of one of the devs on irc.

The rpi has hardware capable of handling the load.  Just the software stack they used for usb was pretty bad.  I've heard they have made some improvements in that area lately but I'm not sure if they've fixed it.

There have been some usb issues with using an rpi previously due to the software stack used.  MineForeman is currently putting together an Arch based distro for rpi users to mine.  The thread for it is here:
It looks promising.

The only wallet I know of that exports as a json file is blockchain.info which is an online wallet.  If that is what you were using then a hard drive crash won't lose your coins you just need to go back to the site and log in.
