Awesome job not_reserved---i knew it but you proved it---It is the bragging in the variouse post about his office and come by and see us etc...-------BUSTED BY YOUR OWN CLAIMS---yes virtual offices are normal but you claimed and implied a whole alot more---bitspend???bitfash???? older post  --I am not defending enymity.com, I am defending honesty and decency as you well know. You have altered your business model as you have been made aware of laws and methods already in place. Your original model claimed anonymity which is ILLEGAL with Bitcoins and with dollars is an existing patented system employed by four companies and licensed to seventeen. This action makes you a criminal in a number of ways and makes bitspend an ILLEGAL operation. You are in violation of a number of state and federal laws and in direct violation of the Banking and Secrecy act as well as the Patriot act. YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAW and honest business men, who have followed the law and jumped through all the hoops and red tape, hate people like you. A legitimate website and/or business is required to have a few basic components----a privacy policy to be Hippa compliant---a terms of use policy----an SSL certificate---money laundering and terrorism compliancy policy----the list goes on and on----YOU SIR ARE A FRAUD AND I CHALLENGE YOU TO ANSWER THESE SPECIFIC POINTS AND STOP LYING TO THE CONSUMER AND GIVING BITCOINS A BAD NAME. The enymity.com site is the only legal way I know of to purchase an receive a service or a product, from the internet, with complete anonymity.
2 + 2 still equals 4, right? You take a dollar and buy Bitcoins, your Bitcoins are now worth less then the dollar you just had, you now take this less amount and decrease it even more buy using this ILLEGAL entity calling itself bitspend, Now you have already lowered your purchasing power, for no apparent reason but hey lets double the S &amp; H by first shipping the product to the bitspend “warehouse” where they can then turn around and ship it to you doubling the cost of the shipping and this is all based upon crossing your fingers and hoping that the bitcoin maintains it value while the third party holds and controls it, because there is no insurance policy if it doesn’t as many people just experienced. Bitcoins has been touted from the beginning as an anonymous purchasing process and to a large extent that is the reason for its growth and this implied anonymity was due to the non-existent reporting requirements for the actual transaction. A month ago the powers that are changed all of that when they made all virtual currencies subject to the bank reporting requirements. This now means that every time someone purchases bitcoins or spends bitcoins the facilitator of the transaction is required by law to record the identifying information of the person conducting the transaction. The fact that bitspend/Justin claim to do what they do clearly shows his lack of knowledge of the law and that bitspend is an illegal operation, nothing more nothing less. But hey, if you just happen to have some bitcoins lying around you can use bitspend to spend them and devalue them even more. The big point that the consumer is missing is that the Vendor’s credit card % cost is actually built into the product cost, so when you use bitcoins to purchase an item you are paying both the credit card fee and the exchange rate. I wanted to point this out because some people are claiming that the bitcoin use rates are equivalent to the credit card process but in reality you are incurring both when using bitcoins and you are tripling down when using bitspend---HELLOOOOOOO
