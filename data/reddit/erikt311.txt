I’ve seen ten charts today from ten different people (actually a couple of them might even have been from the same person...) showing 100 different indicators and drawing 7 different conclusions. 
This reminds me a lot of astrology and numerology. Somebody will end up being right just from the law of averages and then build a following who will somehow overlook the next 5 times the same person is wrong. 
Human beings are really good at finding patterns in randomness because we feel like chaos has to have order (see religion).

In all seriousness, though, I’m not sure I personally think this is a grand idea. I’m not convinced the infrastructure is quite there yet, based on the past few months. I’d rather see some continued consolidation and organic growth. Get further into segwit and lightning and some decentralized exchanges and then open the floodgates. Keep opening new onramps that can actually handle the adoption, etc. Right now the exchanges seem totally overwhelmed, both technically and from a support perspective. They need some time to get out ahead a bit.
On the other hand, it WOULD be a good spot for somebody like Robinhood looking to make an even bigger splash. If only they were opening nationwide.

@_date: 2018-01-28 23:09:25
Yeah I hear you. I was just looking at bitstamp and s couple of others for comparison (I’m usually watching Gdax too) and was struck by the contrast. Gdax has a huge sharp drop in volume starting somewhere around the new year that has remained consistently low. I do t see that in the other platforms, oddly. I would almost have expected that given how many had turned off registrations for a bit. But the volume on, say, bitstamp, has been much more variable. Down a bit from December, for sure, but nowhere near as much. Odd.

Bitcoin (any crypto) is a high risk investment. As everyone who bought in in December has realized, there's certainly no guarantee that your money will grow at all, let alone quickly. You should invest if it aligns with your risk tolerance and overall asset allocation accordingly.  We can't answer that for you.

I generally like it because it has segwit, custom fees, and several good security options. The downside is that they do not have the development resources to commit to any tools allowing you to export any forked coins, so you will not be able to get those in most cases if you care about that. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:08:54
The only thing that makes price goes up is a higher demand at the same supply level. Some things that I hope will influence supply:
Institutional money as big banks/brokerages move into the Bitcoin/crypto space bwith ETFs, more futures, etc. 
Bringing the fees down with increased segwit adoption and lightning. 
Progress along the adoption curve. More people aware of and curious about crypto could pump it up. 
Etc. 
But none of those are guaranteed and they are far from the only factors.

Doesn’t bode well when an executive personally corresponds with you and you still get no follow through. That’s frustrating. Scaling issues or not, part of the role of a support leader is to get resolution for hot issues/customers.

As far as I know, all the "Bitcoin IRAs" are just self-directed IRAs with catchy marketing brand names (and probably more restricted than a normal self directed IRA).  Look into a self directed IRA. Or GBTC.  Or wait for Bitcoin ETFs to finally be apporoved.

That’s probably the best way to get an actual sense. I think they are being a little naive on the roadmap, which essentially says "we hope to talk to all the right people and eventually integrate into retirement accounts in the future."

Getting money out of exchanges is easy. See other comments in this thread. Getting money from cold storage back to exchanges to sell will involve more explicit fees. That’s just how it works. 
Use a combination of cold storage for funds you want to keep long term and another wallet for your “spending money.”  Like a savings and checking account. You will still have some fees, but at the current levels, we're talking about cents (or maybe dollars if you aren't using segwit and have a lot of inputs or something). Not really all that different to credit card processing fees. Only difference is you don't see those credit card processing fees explicitly, as merchants generally price them into the price of goods you are buying. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:32:51
I’m posting this chart to counter the “doom and gloom” that I perceive as a pervasive attitude at the moment.  I understand why those who bought in at 19k are concerned, but I think it’s important to illustrate that if you take a more macro view, there’s every reason to be optimistic still. 
I also happen to align more with a Buffett-style buy and hold strategy, in no small part because it’s a much more stress-free way to invest. It just so happens that my experience has been that’s it’s also much more successful (I’m 37 and retired). Crypto represents approximately 10% of my portfolio, so yes, I really do not care or have any stress about this. I wouldn’t have allocated more than my tolerance to something with this risk profile. 
I understand that some folks prefer trading and actually enjoy the daily wild swings. Great! But for those who are having a hard time with it, perhaps a change of perspective would be useful. Clearly, even just from the responses to this post, some people haven’t yet even figured out how to look at monthly charts vs daily or hourly. 
I’m not here to tell you what to do. Makes no difference to me at all. Just trying to illustrate another side to the coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:50:29
The Bitcoin network can only process so many transactions at a time. Right now, demand is so high that there are more transactions than available space for thosr transactions. Miners generally prioritize by mining those with higher fees first because that's one way they make money back. So it's essentially a bidding war to get your transactions mined. 
Several off-chain layers/solutions have been developed (including lightning network) that either aim directly to reduce this or through some other goal are likely to reduce this. The major exchanges and wallets now need to implement them. That's essentially where the hold up is now.

To elaborate on how that relates to your original question, we have already seen how other layered tech (lightning for example) is being developed to address some of the core concerns you mentioned. Developers will innovate in such a way, building on Bitcoin itself rather than developing totally separate projects (although clearly the amount of alt coins shows they are doing that, too) because Bitcoin has gotten big enough for it to be worthwhile already.

This is the correct answer. There isn’t a “main influence.”  There are many, many influences. It’s why, even with all the technology at our disposal today, there are no accurate forecasting models. Lots of people like to point out their successes with TA or FA (or s combination of the two) - while conveniently ignoring the failures - but nobody has beyond a crude, general, often incorrect idea of what will happe in the future. There are just too many variables.

So the things “whalecalls” is reporting are the effect of the big drop, not the cause.

I would first make sure I had an adequate emergency fund and funded retirement account. But then I don't think the monetary system as we know it going to collapse imminently and I look at crypto as a smaller, riskoer portion of my overall diversified portfolio. In my opinion, you would be doing future you a disservice if you didn't acknowledge the possibility that Bitcoin may not make money forever and then plan accordingly (that is, invest in your tax advantaged retirement accounts, whatever they might be wherever you are). 
Or at least this is what I would do if I was working and had a steady income. Until then, I'd be socking away cash since I didn't know when I would have that steady income. At the very least, consider Bitcoin a hobby and spend accordingly. 
Tldr: don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

I don’t think he’s being a dick as much as he’s pointing out that we’re getting on Coinbase’s case because they are apparently unwilling to put in the time and work to create a practice that will be better for the community (and them) in the long run. 
You are essentially doing the same by saying it’s not worth it to you to change your practices or find a bank that can accommodate you. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:39:07
Ok, so think I’m answering my own question from the following two links:
So if I’m understanding this correctly, in the case of liquidated longs, the price drop meant that those holding long positions could no longer cover with cash on hand and a margin call occurred. So they had to then immediately sell their coins at market prices to cover that. So that causes a bit of a cascading downward trend because all those coins got dumped on the market, inundating it with supply. Correct? Or am I still off base?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:17:59

On iOS, I’ve been using GreenAddress. On the plus side, segwit, custom fees, and multisig. On the negative side, seems to be a relatively small dev team, and coupled with multisig, it’s very difficult if not impossible to get any forked coins if you care about that.

Best bet is probably to try the accelerator posted above on the hour every hour until you get lucky. Otherwise, just wait it out. It will eventually drop from the mempool. The default for nodes is 14 days, but that's not guaranteed depending on how individual boxes are set up.  For example, I've had a 9 sat fee transaction stuck since December 16th that's still not dropped. I refuse to pay the current fee for RBF so I'm just going to see how much longer it takes to drop.  Maybe it never will lol. 
It's frustrating. Seems like an oversight to me that there's not an actual strict drop limit (although I'm sure there's some technical reason it can be changed). 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:22:09
Crypto isn't guaranteed to be an income. You could just as easily lose money as make money. Lots of people like to post about their successful trades (just like in the stock market) but you never hear about the thousands who lose either some or all of their money. 
If you are looking for beer money, you are better off getting a job, either one that pays you in traditional currency or one that pays you in crypto (if that's still something you find yourself interested in). 
Rule  is don't invest what you are not willing to lose for a reason. Because it is highly likely you will lose it, especially if your intention is to trade it or even just hold it and wait for moon. 
This should be an appropriately small, higher risk portion of a well-diversified portfolio. I'm fairly conservative, but I wouldn't have any money (other than hobby money) in crypto at all of I didn't first have a stable income, debt free, and retirement accounts maxed out. You are more likely to "make money" that way than with 100 bucks in crypto.

Exactly right. “Zoom out” just means to look at things from a more macro level. I think it gives a little more context about where we are right now, although as some have pointed out, if you are trading or hyper-focused on the here and now, you lose the granularity, as well.

I’m not sure anybody really knows. I’ve seen predictions on one hand that BTC would soar because people would dump money in there as a store of value (the “gold bug” theory?). However, it also seems to me like much of the new money might be directed elsewhere because casual investors wouldn’t feel like they had disposable income to invest in something “unproven.” Who knows? We’ll find out at some point...

If you are invested heavily enough that daily normal fluctuations are giving you anxiety, that's a good indication that you are invested too heavily. Nobody likes seeing drops, but if you invest beyond your risk tolerance, it's not healthy, either financially or emotionally.

Eh.  If it goes to 1, there's very little to lose at that point. The money I would gain from selling at 1 wouldn't make a long term blip on my life, and the damage would already be done. So might as well hold (and buy more).

Well, one could argue that the merits of a support organizations are determined just as much by how the exceptions are handled than by the norms. Congrats on the success. To me, personally, though, “it’s not my role to ...” is a red flag that demonstrates a lack of accountability in your leadership culture, even if technically true. 
Like I said, I’m taking my business elsewhere just based on the response here. I’m under no delusions that this impacts you at all, but primarily just wanted to thank OP, selfishly, for providing info that helps me make my decision, at least.  I would be frustrated, too.

Just trying to tie in the daily discussion with the same question to this thread for anyone tuning on.  Got things slightly backward:
From : I'm also new to the futures thing, but there's one aspect I know is incorrect.  The futures traders are not actually buying coins.  They are cash settled contracts (investopedia definition) meaning that the contract is for "the cash equivalent of X,XXX BTC at $20k each in 90 days" not for "X,XXX BTC in 90 days" itself.
So they aren't dumping the coins on the market.  They are not directly affecting the BTC market as much as they are affected by the market.

@_date: 2018-01-10 12:58:12
You are welcome. Yes, I’m not preaching “buy the dip” because I want to ensure my own success (although that would be great, too). I preach it (and “zoom out”) because I think it’s still counterintuitive for a lot of new investors (especially with this volatility) and because I believe that it’s how fortunes are made. There’s probably some money for some people to make in playing the daily/weekly swings, but for the vast majority of us who believe in the tech/economics long term (and for me personally, that’s a core prerequisite to have any money in this in the first place), I’m just saying that we’d all do ourselves a favor spending our time productively instead of staring at the charts.

I’ve been using it for a few weeks now. I love it. I find the interface intuitive, I love how you can deposit money and immediately use it before it clears.

Lots of new onramps coming on board (like Robinhood, decentralized exchanges, etc) for people to get money into Bitcoin more easily, usage across the board has been rising, there's fantastic development going on in the community (lightning, MAST, RSK, Ivy, simplify, etc), public awareness is up, all kinds of institutional money coming on board (can't wait for a crypto ETF to be approved someday soon), costs are going down thanks to segwit, lightning and more efficient network usage, and even the normal FUD about regulation and state/bank naysayers hasn't been terrible (look at Japwn and Canada and some of the countries embracing Bitcoin) etc. All these fundamental things look great to me. There's always going to be volitility, but of you are in this for the long run, it's an exciting time for sure. 
This subreddit is full of haters, bcash shills, and alt coin advocates. Everybody wants the king to fail. My advice: start following community members on Twitter who actually are interested in Bitcoin and discuss the things actually going on with it. If you follow the right people, you'll have a much cleaner picture of what is happening (and I'm not talking about all the charting TA guys who are everywhere, I'm talking about the development community and other commentary that isn't so focused on guessing price, which is what this subreddit has turned into).

I wouldn't expect big bucks. I've got a couple year old media server mining ethereum just for fun (not overclocked or anything) making like 60 bucks a month (factoring in everything).

I’m not sure I get ya. Why NOT buy each time the price drops for a bit and you have cash? If you are planning on, say, dollar cost averaging, it’s essentially the same thing except you time it a little bit.

If you are interested in lower cost alt coins instead of bitcoin for some reason, you’ll likely need to buy BTC, eth, or lite coin first and then swap through an exchange that carries those other alts. It’s heresy on this subreddit, but see what trading pairs exist for the coin you want and then choose either lite coin or eth, as for 20 bucks worth the fees will be much smaller st this point. 
I’d just buy 20 bucks worth of bitcoin myself, though. If you do so through Coinbase/Gdax or Gemini, it won’t cost you anything to withdraw then to your wallet when you have them. And no reason to sign up for a secondary exchange just to do the swap for the alts. 
Edit: I’m not sure what the minimal deposits and withdrawals are though. Never tried with 20 bucks before.

This will round out the BTC per share to an even number. That's got to be why. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:57:19
He’s saying that with the premium, it was about 30+k price equivalent. Each share of GBTC holds .091 shares of actual bitcoin, so a share price of 3500 means that people were willing to speculate, based on the premium, that BTC would be going much higher.  
The problem is that the premium in GBTC isn’t simply a bet on future price.  It also prices in ease of entry (not having to use an exchange and being able to invest through a normal broker), the otherwise difficult to accomplish ability to hold in tax advantaged accounts (tax free bitcoins in a Roth IRA, for example), and the payout as distributions to share holders of forked coins. 
One of my all time favorite investments for those reasons, but OPs statement isn’t the full story.

I'm a little confused on what this app is. Is it simply a ticket watching app? Or are you attempting to compete with portfolio apps like Blockfolio and Delta? If the latter, does it track actual individual purchases or just total amounts? It would have to do the former to really compete with portfolio apps to be useful for things like tax reporting. If there was a demo, I'd probably download it and try it out. But it seems like it maybe doesn't do what I need it to doctor replace those other apps, so not going to at this time without more detail. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:28:56
By what measure are you coming to the conclusion that adoption is plummeting? Transactions are trending up, hash power is trending up, the amounts of money sent is trending up, price month to month is trending up, etc. The only think really shrinking is market cap, but that's bound to happen just based on the sheer volume of new alt coins (which, by the way, only happened because Bitcoin was popular enough to create a new market, essentially).

I don’t think the two are incompatible. Just recommending a good, non-anonymous source who knows what he’s talking about if you do care to learn more about your investment (which can be a good idea). He hosts one of the most well respected podcasts in the community about bitcoin, which has on actual core developers, isn’t a shill like this post is about, and actually discusses bitcoin from the perspective of somebody who is using it and believes in it, not trying to make a quick buck. Sure, blissful ignorance can be nice if that’s what you choose to do. But there is also value in sharing sources that are actually good, too.

So the things “whalecalls” is reporting are the effect of the big drop, not the cause. So it’s not that the liquidation’s are causing or increasing the drops, it’s that the drops are causing the liquidations. Got it. So it’s likely really the news about Korea or something else acutely impacting the market, thus causing the liquidations. 
Appreciate the explanation effort. I still feel like a dolt when it comes to truly understanding how futures and the market itself interplay. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:56:16
Yes. I do think some events do have very real, albeit short term effects (emotional buying/selling, for example). Every time there's a big move like this, you can pick out several news or other items that I'm sure impacted things to a certain extent. I also think it's a big red herring to focus on one or two, because like you said, it doesn't do lot of good and there's no real way to quantify the impact weighting. 100,000 people selling could have 50,000 individual reasons and only the aggregate in hindsight looks like some big black swab type thing. Who knows.

Right, for a week or two things might get a little slow until the difficulty adjusts.  Many of the Chinese miners are already in the process of moving to Canada (where Quebec, for example has a hydroelectric surplus and competition for data centers for mining is very high at the moment) and elsewhere, though, as this hasn’t been unexpected. So it would be a bonus for decentralization and because of the difficulty change, I don’t  see how it would really impact anything except for maybe a very short period. 
It’s FUD plain and simple, if it’s even really effecting the market. I’m not sure it is.

PSA this doesn't seem like it has changed anything. There were never like-kind exchanges before this law (at least according to most tax experts familiar with crypto that I've seen). This law just explicitly clarified that.

This type of stuff (refunds after specific times, etc) are going to be the type of stuff that all of the upcoming smart contract projects (MAST, RSK, the Ivy IDE, etc) will excel at. As it is today, my understanding is that Bitcoin script isn't really used for much and I'm not sure how you'd be able to pull that off at the bitcoin level (I guess it would be possible with something built on top somehow). But we'll see more of this type of stuff coming up in the next few years assuming these projects come to fruition.

My money (which isn’t rich, by any means, just gives me a bit of financial independence) hasn't come from crypto (though it's been a fun year, for sure). But I wouldn't say "happiness" is the right word. For me, "security" is probably a better word. There is most certainly a particular type of peace that comes with financial security. But that doesn't mean you don't still have other life stresses. Family, medical issues, depression and anxiety, etc. all still exist. I'd say that in some aspects, the more financial security you have, the MORE stressful some things (ahem, family) become. 
I don’t think money has had a net positive impact on me truthfully. Just DIFFERENT focuses. 
That said, I was never poor enough where I couldn’t make ends meet and have always been able to live below my means. I identify a lot with all those studies that show that money does by happiness up to a very specific point, but beyond that point, the diminishing returns happen very quickly. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:19:48
I’m not so sure your original premise is accurate. It’s sexy (and convenient) to think it’s all a big conspiracy, and no doubt there is some level of manipulation happening (or we wouldn't need the regulation that other industries have to begin with), but I think much of this you can take at face value.  Volume is highest when volitility is highest because people want in or out. The exchanges haven't been scaled with the type of growth they've had in mind (why would you build our Infrastructure and support for 4000% growth or whatever it was? That would almost always be throwing huge money away). They just need time to catch up and maybe get ahead. It takes time to plan and execute growth, including both the hardware and the support staff. Cant just flip a switch and say "as of now, I immediately allocate an additional 100% to this budget). That's not how it works.

How a company interacts with its customers from the highest levels often reflects its values. I may be missing out on a good product, but based on this interaction, I’m not missing out on supporting a company with values that align with mine. I have no problems “missing out” on that.  The product itself is an important part, but certainly not the holistic totality. I’d like to know how that company stands by its products and services when things don’t go as planned, especially when talking about something that needs to be reliable, stable, and respected to be valuable.

Sure. If your idea is to just accumulate and hold, you can buy as little as you want. Using GDAX or Gemini (not sure about others), you can even withdraw to a wallet for free.  It’s probably not worth trading or even moving money around from wallet to wallet much with the fees right now with that little. But just buying and holding? Why not?

Bitcoin is an appropriately small, riskier portion of my well diversified portfolio. I fully expect, as is the case with all smaller, riskier, investments, that I could lose it all. Or maybe it will be the homerun, as occasionally small riskier investments are.  In either case, I’m aware of the risk and reward and have allocate assets accordingly.

It appears that they did a lot of things to support bcash at the expense of BTC when they added it to the exchange early, disabled bcash/BTC trading (still) and had to clear the order books and delay trading for a while in an effort to pump it up because of UTXO BTC problems they have. Or perhaps there were just a lot of coincidental mess ups at that time that we’re not sufficiently explained, all while leadership was essentially absent and customer support was similarly absent. 
Or it could all just be symptoms of severe scaling issues.

Dollar cost averaging is investing the same amount on a set schedule (like 100 per week, for example). The idea is that you don’t need to try and time any ups and downs, because you are “averaging” your cost basis, which to some extent nullifies the peaks and valleys and is a “set it and forget it” type of strategy that you can fully automate.

Honestly I have no idea. I'm just holding now. I think there are too many variables tied to bitcoins success (regulation, etc). So I keep an appropriately small amount of my whole portfolio in Bitcoin/crypto. It's been good to me so far, but if it tanks, it won't kill me.  I may not end up a Bitcoin billionaire that way, but I also won't end up in the slums.

It seems to me that it would take the “common man” doing a whole lot of buying when I whale does dump a bunch of BTC for profit to begin reallocating some of that wealth. Of course, there’s nothing stopping other whales from doing the same thing. And when a whale does dump a bunch, that’s going to be when people start panic selling, so I’m not sure the psychology of most people would lead them to buy. For the same reason that idiots panic sell stocks during a market downturn.

What do you mean by "actual worth?" There is no definitive price for Bitcoin. It's worth is determined by how much people are willing to pay for it, which is exactly what each exchange is doing. So Bitcoin is "worth" more on coinbase because buyers on coinbase are willing to pay more for it, likely due to a variety of factors including convenience.

I would make sure I had no debt, had an emergency fund, had a well diversified existing portfolio, and then if I had room in my asset allocation for 2k more for a riskier bet, buy more bitcoin. Through an exchange, unless I wanted something through a brokerage in an IRA or the like. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:43:43
Coinbase seems to be about as legitimate of a company as there is in this sector. My view is that they are struggling to keep up with massive, massive demand right now. That has manifested itself in some of the infastructire issues you mentioned, like outages and support staffing issues. The bank processing times don't really have anything to do with it. That's just how Bank transfers and processing work. 
That said, I have no direct knowledge of the company. But I'd say it's not totally unexpected considering the massive inflow of new users and traffic. You can't just hire people and say "staffing issue is now solved." You have to recruit people and train them, which takes time.  Same with hardware Infrastructure. You can't just throw money at a scalability challenge. You have to create an operations plan that includes upgrade planning. These things take time.

Nobody knows. It depends on who you believe. Read as much as you can about it and read varied opinions. Some believe it could end up valued at a million and some think it will end up at 0. As with any investment, the best you can do is make an educated guess. 
My take is that I think blockchain is here to stay in some form or another. Just about every industry is either already using it or investigating using it in some capacity. So for me, investing a little into Bitcoin is one way to stimulate me to learn more about the underlying tech. I think that has value regardless of where Bitcoin ends up.

They already do. Check out GBTC, which is a bitcoin trust that you can buy through a brokerage. You'd think that it would track pretty darn closely to Bitcoin, but the premium (how much higher it's trading for than the actual underlying Bitcoin it holds) has ranged from 30-90 percent the last couple weeks. Meaning that people are willing to pay 30-90 percent more than what the bitcoins actual worth to be able to buy it through a brokerage. Part of that is because you can hold it in a tax advantaged retirement account where you can have tax free gains (is Roth IRA for example). 
I'd love an ETF (although I'd love a full crypto or even blockchain ETF more for diversity) because you'd cut those management fees and premiums that something like GBTC has way down.

Bread has explained elsewhere that the timer on the app itself (the one that keeps updating) is based on something (I forget what exactly) that means it isn't accurate with the current transaction backlog. 
They don't control the network backlog and given how things are now, you're likely stuck behind higher fee transfers.  Not a whole lot you can do but wait it out. My understanding is that most likely, it will time out in 14 days of you don't get picked up by then, at which point it will be returned to your sending wallet where you can try again with a higher fee.

I have about 10% invested in crypto/blockchain (note that my target was only about 3, but with crazy returns and the fact that I JUST rebalanced, it’s still out of whack). Another 2% in precious metals (just in case zombie apocalypse). About ten percent bonds/treasury protected securities, and the rest allocated to stocks of all caps and demographics. 
So yeah, I’m not going crazy with crypto. I consider this a small, riskier portion of my portfolio. I’m 36.  Portfolio consists of two 401ks (wife and I), hers maxed out (I’m a stay st home dad now), two Roth IRAs (maxed), an HSA that I use as a retirement fund, a smaller taxable brokerage account, and the various other things. I did not include in that asset allocation the property we own, which consists of the house and a fairly large swath of farmland that we own and rent out (or I’d probably have some investment income in REITs or something also).

Get your agenda out of here. It has no place. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:29:32
Ok I was confused that you capitalized Futures. Thought you meant that it was based on Futures (like many of the proposed ETFs would be). Just clarifying that it’s not. In my opinion, most of the premium can be explained by the ease of entry/purchase and the fact that it can be held in retirement accounts. But I get what you are saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:32:34

I don’t think they announced a payout date yet. Just that it would be paid out with the record date. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:56:28
Why wouldnt it be true? Nobody is forcing anybody to buy bitcoin. So supply and demand is the answer.  Everything else is just a factor of either supply or demand.

I’m going to assume you aren’t in the US? If not, I can’t really help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:58:33
No, they were not. You are cherry picking data to try and make a point that doesn't add up. You picked the worst 20 year history for the stock market that was possible (which is fine, I did say any 20 year or longer period). But then to make that work, you chose mortgage rates that were only normal for the TAIL end of that period in the 80's.  
I thought it was a given that we were saying that one would have invested the money vs paying off the mortgage DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD.  Using your 65-85 time period, yes, stock gains would have been 0.  But mortgage rates would have been 5-6 percent. 
Assuming that money was invested for twenty years, what would have happened in the early 80's? You would have made a KILLING on returns when the market turned up. 
So unless you you somehow ended up with a mortgage rate 3 times higher than normal was on 65, and didn't actually invest during that same period, AND happened to retire at the exact moment in 1985 that you paid off your house (at the magical 15% that didn't exist in 65), you would have had quite a great ride in the 80s and 90s. 
I'm not too young to remember shit. I'm just calling you out on cherry picking the doomsday scenereo (that isn't actually accurate). It's like running cFirsim or FireCalc today, seeing that you have a 99% success rate on the Monte Carlo sims, and saying "nah, I'm good.  There's a 1% chances I'll fall a little short." And then investing in Bitcoin with that same risk tolerance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:02

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:48:32
Relax, bud. I know it's hard to hear now, but think of it like this:
In the grand scheme of your life, 4k is not a lot. I know it doesn't feel like it now, but it's true. This is probably more valuable to you as a 4k investing lesson than any college course will be. Diversify and let time do its job (and good for you for even thinking about that at this point in your life). 
You will find a way to make college work and you will be better off for this, even if it does go to 0. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:26
That's right, hopefully. If not crypto, hopefully blockchain in general.  Just saying that if we want to talk true diversification, we need to talk about the big picture. Invest wisely and if it does blow up even more, it becomes a bigger part of your portfolio by itself. No need to to risk the house and kids (unless you don't like them). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:55:45

You cannot buy "Bitcoin stock," at least directly.  Your question seems to assume that Bitcoin is both a publicly traded company that you can invest in as a shareholder and an asset that you can purchase directly (in the form of purchasing Bitcoin through an exchange directly). That is not the case. The latter is true. The former is not. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:51:27
Ha, fair. I was thinking more along the lines of a small portion of the overall retirement account :) Best you can do today is GBTC and some blockchain centered tech funds like ARKW (Both of which I've been really happy with recently).

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:19:09
That IS the market price for bitcoin in that market. 
Why do bananas cost different amounts at Walmart, Target, and Kroger? Because there is no one set “banana price.”  Buyers (you) and sellers (Walmart) have matched up their sell price and your buy price, and that is the “market price.”  Don’t think the price at Walmart is fair? Then you are free to go to Kroger for a cheaper price. It might take you longer to get there and maybe it’s in a bad part of town, so it’s riskier. But your bananas might be cheaper when you factor those things in. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:32
Agree. When crypto makes up an appropriately small part of an overall diversified portfolio, this whole thing has little impact. It's all good.

Ok. Good luck on your taxes if you are in the US. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:23:08
Or maybe he’s invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks/bonds/ and some riskier investments that have performed well and outgrown his target allocation. In which case, if you don’t believe that bitcoin is set to dominate the world and that most finance is cyclical, it’s probably a wise choice to rebalance at some point. 
Or maybe your risk tolerance is high and you believe that bitcoin is set for world domination. All depends on your investment theory. I sure wouldn’t risk my overall portfolio to go all in on bitcoin at this point (although I’ve added some to my portfolio). But that’s just me. 
Choice is yours OP. Good luck!

I don’t think it’s inherently a terrible idea, but I think we've got a while on the adoption curve before people are comfortable with what to do with a wallet.  Too bad, though, because it would be a great way to try and introduce more people. A classic Catch 22 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:03:06
They do not set prices. They match up buyers and sellers. Different exchanges could have different prices because they have different buyers and sellers who agree to different prices. I feel like you are overthinking this :)

Don’t forget to account for taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:45:18
I’m definitely not an accountant, but my understanding is that if you sell for USD, even if it’s just to immediately buy another crypto currency, you create a taxable event subject to capital gains taxes (in the US, anyway). 
I’m not positive how that would work if you just exchanged directly without USD in the middle (like if you exchanged directly Ltc for BTC or something). 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:34:27
I’m not sure they want to lose the tax revenue.

Might as well give it 4 more days to see if it drops from the mempool at this point. I’m in the same boat. Going to give it the default 14, and then if it doesn’t drop determine what to do from there.

I’m not sure. Might depend on source wallet. I’m not an expert, just trying to be patient based on what I think I do know :) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:09:34
I hold a large amount. No sketchy exchanges to deal with and I can buy it in my Roth IRA, with no worries about taxes. Those are two of the biggest reasons it generally has a hefty premium.

That’s pretty standard buy low, sell high rebalancing...
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:34:35
I cannot pay my mortgage or utilities in BTC. I cannot sell my house in BTC if I need the liquidity. I cannot get groceries at the local grocery store if I am starving. 
So no, I'm not there yet. I do believe that blockchain has the potential to be really disruptive. And I do believe Bitcoin had the potential to someday reach a tipping point with usage where we could get there. But for now, it remains for me a relatively small and risky portion of my diversified portfolio.

You won't be able to mine Bitcoin without specialized equipment that the big boys in large mining operations have. 
If you are interested in mining other coins, there are potentially some that could be minorly profitable depending on your video card(s). Check out whattomine.com.

This is a solid tip not just for bitcoin wallet info, but for bank account, investment account info, etc. keep (in a safe spot someplace, obviously, like a safety deposit box) an update financial sheet that includes access info for ALL your accounts in the event that something bad happens. Of course, the security of that sheet is of the utmost importance.

That’s not how exchanges work. They are just facilitating matching up buyers and sellers. If there aren’t enough bitcoin sellers to match to the buyers, they simply don’t get matched and no transaction takes place. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:25:57
To be clear, I'm not convinced the tax plan has anything to do with, UNLESS there are a ton of uninformed folks who thought they could trade tax free (or unless they are correct).

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:42:14
Can we please stop spreading that lie? Coin to coin trading was never explicitly a like-kind exchange. Got back and look at the bitcoin wiki or any of the tax posts in this subreddit (including mine yesterday). The new tax bill just explicitly laid out what we already knew and the tax law that is already reality. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:38
It was never clear there was a loophole to begin with. Willful ignorance, maybe.

I’m fairly sure I read today that Cuban said he has invested. His point was that you shouldn’t invest more than you can afford to lose.  As has JP Morgan, at least according to Andreas A. It seems like they are doing it quietly to hedge bets while also publicly trying to deny value.

I don't disagree with diversifying the crypto section, although it does appear that most of them are pretty darned linked. I just wish people would have a little less tunnel vision when it comes to overall market. Maybe I will be wrong and those who go all in on crypto will end up as my boss one day as I am forced to return to the workforce. But man I see a lot of risky folks here. And I actually believe in the vision.

I absolutely think that. I also hold it in my IRA. However, if Bitcoin itself continue to rise, it won't matter much how much the premium contracts because I'll still end up ahead.  IF Greyscale stays in business and can still compete.

No, I’m looking at how businesses of all sectors are either implementing or researching how blockchain can be used, from banking all the way to publishing companies. Right now, I’m just investing in a few tech funds like ARKW and SMH, mostly the hardware being used. I’m hoping some true blockchain ETFs get approved in the near future that will make it easier to invest in a wider swath, though. Nothing too crazy, but just a way to diversify a bit from bitcoin itself while still riding this innovation train.

I'm no expert, but I had wallets created with both Bread and GA. Bread was a much simpler, prettier app. GA had many more configurable options in terms of security/authentication. I chose it for those reasons along with segwit. If you don't plan on making a bunch of transactions, I'm not sure segwit would matter to you. Either is probably going to work fine 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:52:22
No segwit yet. I went with greenaddress because of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:56:42
I'll attempt to answer my own question based on some Googling.  Wish I'd known about this sooner.  Essentially, GA has taken the stance on the past that they don't have the development resources to support the forks. So, to retrieve those forked coins, you have to rely on community or third party developed solutions. For BT Cash, that was only available for 2/3 wallets, although it might be possible for somebody to create a solution for 2/2. 
Is that accurate?
And are you saying that Bread has inherently chosen to support forks so it may be better for anybody who cares about them?
Thanks for bringing this up. Wish I'd known about this yesterday prior to moving everything to GA, although I'm still too new to fully understand whether or not I should even care about forks.

Wouldn’t quantum computing also be disaster for all other current financial/banking systems as they exist today? We’ll reach a point where it’s necessary for ALL of them to evolve into something more secure.  Whatever that is, I imagine that bitcoin will follow suit.

ETFs can be purchased through traditional brokerage accounts including retirement accounts. In the case of, say, a Roth IRA, that means tax free gains. 
There’s also the advantage of trust. Fidelity or Schwab aren’t likely to get hacked or just disappear with your coin. 
Also, instant buys/sells and no worries about transaction fees or times. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:04:49
I've been using the Delta app. My situation isn't terribly complex, because I'm mostly just buying and holding, so it seems sufficient for my needs. You record each transaction (all the buy details) and it tracks current value based on exchange prices.

Spot on. Even if you don’t care at all about bitcoin/blockchain itself and just joined late purely for the moon trip, it’s going to save you a whole lot of stress if you stop watching the minute or even hourly periods and start looking at weeklies or monthlies instead. There are plenty of people who claim to be successful short term investors, and some who even are, but for the vast majority of us, we would be much healthier and better off in life if we zoom out (in life too) and start noticing the forest instead of staring at the trees. 
This South Korea nonsense is a tree. It will soon be lost among the rest of the trees and deserves no particular attention from anybody who is in this zoomed out.

Determine your risk tolerance, from there your portfolio target asset allocation. And then diversify your portfolio (across investments, not just bitcoin/crypto) accordingly. We can’t tell you what to do because we are not you and individually have different risk tolerances and unique situations.

Personally, I think that would give me an incentive to sell. If I’ve only got in what I can afford to lose, I’m not going to sell when there’s a big correction because I’m in it for the long run. If I had in twice as much, I probably would have sold when we bottomed out at 11 and would have had no money in for the current rebound. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:38:40
Could you elaborate on why this is for new people like me?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:24:29
Mining Bitcoin? Not unless you have very expensive hardware and very, very cheap electricity.  At least not profitably. If you want to make a few bucks a months as a hobby, look at other coins instead.

That's exactly what I was thinking it might do in order to get funds into it's economy. But I figured not, because then people like me would just use it as a middle man to send/receive. Just thought I'd ask :)

Sure, if you let emotion get involved. Somebody who is comfortable taking enough risk to invest in crypto surely is comfortable with the risk of a 4% loan, especially given that there has been no modern history where it wouldn’t pay off to keep it.

If it were me, I’d be buying and not selling in that situation.   But I prefer to buy low and sell high.

I believe strongly that of you have enough invested that it's causing you serious anxiety, then you are over-invested.  Sell enough to cover your original investment (plus taxes) and then let the rest ride if you'd like. 
Investing in ANYTHING shouldn't be anxiety inducing, unless you happen to do it for a living.

You haven’t lost anything until you cash out. If you bought because you believed in the short term vision (“end of the year”), then yeah, you were foolish. If you did your homework and believe in the long term vision, none of the past two weeks (or two months) matters.

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:49:32
I think it’s going to be a combo of both. North Korea is going to continue trying to hack and steal bitcoin from major exchanges (and everyplace else) to fund itself in the face of unreal pressure on legitimate finances.  Then, the US and allies will use that as part of the reason to crackdown on crypto currencies as much as they are able to. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:08

Last time I looked, my mortgage wasn’t a 1 year event. Or even a ten year event. Know what happened in ten years since 2008? Record investment returns. So yup, I’m pretty comfortable with that. Again, there would have to be a period of say, 20 years or more for it not to pay off. And if we are in a 20 year recession of that type, we will all have a lot more to worry about than whether we lost a few percentage points on our investments. 
But enjoy losing money by prepaying your mortgage :)

I hold GBTC.  But to be fair, there are several good funds like ARKW that hold smaller stakes of GBTC and are also diversified with tech companies. They haven’t made GBTC-level gains recently, but are similarly trending way up. I like those a lot too. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:55:25
Nah, he's saying that a lot of people seem to be under the impression that trading crypto to crypto today, before the new law takes effect is a like-kind exchange and not a taxable event. It's not and has never been. The new law doesn't seem to change anything except to call it out explicitly. A lot of people who didn't do their homework are probably in for a nasty surprise. I'm not really sure how that would "crash" Bitcoin though. The damage is already done. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:39:16
Is this your video? Some constructive criticism. With the audience level you are shooting for, break it down even more. Ex. When explaining wallets and key pairing, you say things like “you sign the key.”  I’m certain people who don’t know what a wallet is have no idea what that means. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:42:53
Nobody knows what the future holds. You don’t know, your dad doesn’t know, nobody here knows. My suggestion is to go through the resources here in the sidebar, hang out in here and read everything you can, read the counterpoints elsewhere (so you aren’t researching in a bubble) and then determine what you want to do. Which should pretty much be universal life advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:57

I’ve never understood this. If it’s infinitely divisible why is it considered a limited supply? I’ve seen the “slice of pie” analogy before, but that doesn’t seem to work because slices aren’t destroyed or lost. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:51
You are looking at this the right way, in my opinion. As part of a balanced, larger portfolio.  Presumably you’ve already calculated your target asset allocation as a result of your risk tolerance. It ultimately depends on how often you want to rebalance. I don’t do it often.   Yearly.  Maybe twice a year   
Stick to the plan and it’s pretty difficult to get over invested in something based on emotion. 
Of course, others will tell you that bitcoin is the future and will replace fiat currency and all that :) And the goldbugs over in this subreddits will tell you to sell everything and buy gold/silver because the end times are near. 
I like to make sure I don’t get tunnel vision from hanging out in any one particular subreddit/community too long, personally.

I thought it was pretty good, honestly. I'll subscribe. I'm fairly new to this, but understand enough to make sense of it. I'd like to see some more detailed reviews of  wallets. For example, the pros and cons of 2/2 and 2/3 wallets, controlling your own key, and how wallets handle forks.
