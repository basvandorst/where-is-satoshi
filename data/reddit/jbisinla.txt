If you take them to small claims court (which has a limit of around $5k depending on your area), you won't need an attorney.

True, but they often say that they wish they'd been better able to provide for their family, or that they wish they hadn't deluded themselves into falling for a swindle.
Bitcoin is essentially a HIGHLY speculative investment that is only occasionally used as a transactional currency, frequently for purchasing contraband.
If you're not looking to buy illegal product, and aren't a wealthy investor looking to make a gamble with a small portion of your assets, you may want to rethink your intentions. Look at the "all" portion of this chart -    - and see if that looks like a sound option.
I say this as a small business owner who is happy to take bitcoin in payment for my product. The level of people using bitcoin for purchasing at my site was never large, and now it's nearly nonexistent.
If I were you, I'd be headed over to or or and looking into starting a small business offering networking solutions for homeowners and small businesses, as that would be MUCH less of a gamble than bitcoin.

Quick answer. My shaving soap is a soft soap / croap that [can even lather effectively in SEAWATER]( so it just might be what you're looking for.

How are you defining regulations/protections for the principles of freedom?
People who are starving or in ill-health are substantially less free for all practical purposes than those who are healthy and well fed, but you rarely see libertarians arguing for regulations providing a guaranteed minimum income or national healthcare.

A good straight razor costs upwards of $100 new, and both new and vintage straights need to be professionally honed prior to sale (if you're a decent seller). I don't have the honing skill or the inventory to support that at the moment.
(I'm focusing on making the soap (I make all of it from scratch), but there are plenty of good vendors over on that will help you find a good straight.)

I ship internationally (although it gets a little expensive).
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:06:51
Yes. See if your country is on the list. if not, pm me and we'll sort it out.

Good luck!

As a small business owner who accepts bitcoin, I can honestly say that the only thing bitcoin empowers is the very occasional purchase from bitcoin enthusiasts.
While I'm very grateful for the business, it's going to be very hard to use bitcoin as a serious independent transactional currency until its value stabilizes.
Right now, I can accept it easily, as the buyer pays in bitcoins and I get paid in dollars, and the transaction risks are dealt with by the commerce vendor, so basically I'm still dealing in dollars.
If I couldn't readily convert them, and had to leave them as bitcoins, I'd be a little more skeptical, as in the last 2 years, bitcoins have been worth less than $100, over $1100, and are currently just under $500.
That's a speculative investment, not a transactional currency.
Add the fact that it's not impossible to create other cryptocurrencies and bitcoin becomes even more speculative.
Honestly, it's only a matter of time before someone develops a separate algorithm that's pegged to the U.S. dollar, to provide the stability and predictability of a reserve currency, while offering the transaction/confidentiality benefits of a cryptocurrency.
TL:DR - It's cool, and I'll take it, but it's not that empowering.

No, not really. Technical analysis based on chart behavior is like driving a car while only looking into the rear view miror. It tells you little about what's actually going to happen.
Yes, bitcoin is a pretty obvious bubble, but the thing about bubbles is you can't tell how big they're going to get before they pop.
If the economy starts to recover though, IMHO, gold, bitcoin, and real estate are all going to take a pounding, as they've been used as hedges, and the need for them lessens as people find better investment prospects elsewhere.

While this is true, bitcoins also have a much greater potential for reaching the maximum downside than many other investments.
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:15:21
Well, it should be pretty obvious in 6-12 months which way bitcoin's headed.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:16:37
It is also why bitcoins have so much potential downside.
Settling is one thing, being wiped out is another.

I don't see how a currency that is best known for helping people buy drugs anonymously on the silk road, and is also used by the Iranians to avoid currency sanctions, has quite that much upside. I don't see that as a bargain at all. Ymmv, obviously.

If obvious events on the horizon will change the price, then I'm not sure how you can claim a plateau, unless you're predicting a very short duration of the current environment.
I mean, so far this year, [Bitcoin has been valued at: $20 in December, $40 in March, $230, $80, and $140 in April, and between $100-$134ish in May.](
Maybe you and I are using different metrics, or are understanding our terms differently, but I don't see how 30-40% fluctuations over the course of a month, or multiple hundred percent fluctuations over the course of the past 6 months, suggest anything resembling a consensus plateau.
From my perspective as an investor, the volatility combined with the uncertain outlook, do not make bitcoin an appealing option at the moment. (Except maybe as an arbitrage game, as it looks like there's currently a 3-4% gap between Mt. Gox and Bitcoin Exchange.)

Well, I'm shorting gold at the moment, so clearly we're coming from two different viewpoints.
If you think gold is non-divisible and can't be traded online, you may not understand the gold market very well. The percentage of gold trading that occurs at coin shops is a tiny fraction of the overall market.

Stable until the precedents set by the Liberty Reserve litigation  provide ammo to go after BTC related entities.
