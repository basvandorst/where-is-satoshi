This was me. Overly excited and willing to share how much I made this year. I was an ass. Of course I'm willing to share how much I lost as well, but it's not quite as fun. I'm taking this opportunity to refocus on the tech and stop focusing on the price.

Well, if 'survive' means at least existing as an obscure, near worthless, coin or unused technology (except by a very few) then, yes, you are 100% correct that it will survive in even the most meager of states.
I think we all want it to do more than have the most meager existence. We want it to do more than survive, we want it to thrive! 
My very non-technical thought on this; I think the core dev team should take the high ground and incorporate a larger block size, then move on to segwit and the lightning network. But, that may not be technically possible. I would love an explanation, but mostly I would love for the core dev team to be able to incorporate all of the best ideas out there. It would steal the thunder from any dissenters, and keep what we know as 'bitcoin' whole.

I was wondering if there was a conspiracy, but this makes me ch more sense. It's late, I'm tired.

She even admits that she isn't a technologist during the interview. She is focusing on public policy. However, she has no real knowledge about blockchain technology and shouldn't be representing it. She reminds me of Elizabeth Holmes, full of talk but no substance.

I sure don't. Double negatives make statements confusing to me.

Could be a bad USB cable or USB port.

We'll call it LCar for short and watch Roger Ver freak out about LCar being a slur.

Both. Buy some now, buy some when it goes down again. Buy some while it's up too.

Actually, August 1st is when UASF (BIP148) activates. Around July 25th is when SegWt2x (BIP91) activates.

'Cause the Bitcoin drama don't stop!

The bitcoin block time is 10 minutes. So assuming no outages or major backlogs, it would take about 10 minutes. But this is gdax/coinbase you're talking about... so YMMV
