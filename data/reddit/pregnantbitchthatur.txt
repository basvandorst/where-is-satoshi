You can post whatever you want. If you want to look pathetic, go ahead. You're cutting your own throats.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:07:48
Stop jerking yourselves off and fix your own problems. This makes you look weak
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:40:01
I think Bitcoin is destroying itself, and your'e making yourselves look weak with this petty, self-congratulatory schadenfreude
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:28:45
Bitcoin has major PR problems Bcash doesn't right now. Stop yapping and right your ship
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:41:57
To the general public, you fool. I don't give a shit because its obvious to me the Bitcoin community has their head up their ass. I'm assuming you want universal adoption of Bitcoin as the prime cryptocurrency. This is exactly how you will never get it. You look like butthurt amateurs. It's your funeral
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:37:33
There's a fella by the name of Adam Eget, spends his days underneath the Queensboro bridge jerking off punks. Just $15 a man, not sure if he takes Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:36:02
You think Bitcoin is doing just fine? Wow. Keep putting that stick in your spokes, Chachi.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:59:50
Jesus Christ. This is sad
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:47:30
How's it doing in the last month? How many people have turned their back on BTC as a viable currency? You have major PR problems, and whining about what Bitcoin Cash is doing will make it harder to move forward. Again, I don't give a shit because I'm not buying any BTC. It's your funeral
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:10:30
I'll do it for 29
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:04
You'll be fine. It's going much higher
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:03:04
Exactly. My hardware wallet falls into a volcano. Then what?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:04:21
That he'd never tweeted about it
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:51
That sounds super scientific, thanks Dr. Anecdote
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:37:53
You'll be fine. The Trump economy is just what crypto needed, baby
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:41:36
If it's not baby blue with a big stupid wing you are a bad person
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:27:04
It's a 30 Rock reference, you whiny twat
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:54:45
Nobody cares what a drummer thinks about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:52:00
It's a 30 Rock reference, dumbfuck. And this sub is the whiniest, most butthurt sub on Reddit. You're actively harming yourselves. Wake the fuck up, junior
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:28:43
How many Lightning nodes in Africa these days? Bitcoin has nothing to offer the average African. This altruistic pose is horseshit.
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:44:55
Weaponizing your platform for the benefit of some of the most evil people on the planet has consequences. And they don't work with people they can't control. I wonder what leverage they have over 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:46:24
Bitcoin is fast becoming a joke. You bitches crying all the time is making it worse for you.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:25:50
AKA panic
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:57:40
You need to fix your broken platform and stop whining.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:44:35
Yes, only you have figured it all out. The rest of us are mere children compared to you Mr. Wizard
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:04:10
Nutting 50 times a day?
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:50:30
He's been a bad, bad boy. The Facebook data mining story is a universal one for the social media companies, and 2016 wasn't the first of it. At some point you stop being a social media company and start being a political action committee. There are extraordinarily strict rules about that sort of thing.
And those are the least of  worries, really. Antitrust is coming like a freight train, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him on the run/incarcerated by the end of the year for some genuinely evil shit.
Like a number of the tech titans, Jack Dorsey is a piece of human garbage, and when people wake up to how bad of one he really was, Twitter will cease to exist. His time is up.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:16:49
I have, you sad twat. Your platform is dissolving before your eyes, you have a hideous PR problem, and your answer is paranoid raving about shit that doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:30:56
Are the Keystone Cops running Bitcoin? Hard to imagine failing worse than you are right now.  Pathetic
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:49:06
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:52:20
Jack Dorsey is a POS. Period.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:30:34
Do you people do anything but throw tantrums?
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:40:46
You're thinking about this all wrong, dude. Just imagine a tree, a really big tree
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:35:28
Rektum? Nearly killed r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:50:26
I'm not the one with the PR and functionality problems. You're blowing it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:25:41
Bitcoin is having the mother of all PR problems, and pretty much standing still otherwise. You're getting left behind because you chose poorly.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:13:56
LOL. Exactly what I expected
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:41:40
The irony
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:25:06
Tech chief won't be a chief much longer. I would avoid attaching yourself to anything with his name on it.
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:22:46
For my children, 8 and 12
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:45:21
Agreed. You're the most pathetic bitches online right now. You do want to know how others see you, don't you?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:44:36
You sure are. Instead of working to make your platform the best, you're whining about other peoples'. And your shit doesn't really work like you always said it would. Sounds like a fine use of your time.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:43:50
In Russia, Bitcoin kill YOU
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:40:39
THE BLOOD OF THE UNBELIEVER SHALL RAIN DOWN
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:23:55
I'm more of an Ethereum guy right now, as their platform actually DOES SOMETHING. And you can use it with considerably more convenience than fucking Bitcoin. But what I like is beside the point. You're blowing it. You've BEEN blowing it. And what do I see here in your sub? WHINING. Incessant whining. It's fucking pathetic.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:51:45
Jack Dorsey will be a very different thing in about six months. I wouldn't attach myself to anything with his name on it.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:45:35
This whole sub is Bitcoin trolls. Are you joking?
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:32:52
Enough of this whiny horseshit. Explain why Bitcoin is better. Period. This is truly pathetic.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:52:04
Lucky him
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:39:42
I can't imagine a more tiresome take than this. You lack self-awareness
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:45:56
That's a great argument for Bitcoin being the one. Great job, Chachi.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:38:19
Bitcoin attacked itself, fool.
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:45:54
You're a terrible liar. Bitcoin is a fucking joke right now. Fix your problems and stop whining, you pathetic bitches. Your paranoid delusions are just sad
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:51:47
This is a childish and information-soft take. Shut up about your feelings. No one cares or ever will
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:21:32
AAAaaaaand right back to your hurt feelings. Let me guess: you're one of the Net Neutrality idiots.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:13:41
What's insane is crippling your platform, trying to fix it with a horseshit add-on, and then whining about how the mean people are ruining your life.
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:40:27
What an idiotic statement by a congenital liar
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:22:39
This is a level of delusion I had yet to encounter on Wow.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:01:26
I set it at 80 kajillion
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:31:26
Did you learn delusion and losing at everything in life from Hillary?
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:34:47
Keep telling yourselves that, as if repeating it does anything but make you seem sad
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:05:34
Fix your platform. Stop whining. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:12:35
You're talking in emotional terms about people making their case for one or another platform. For your own sanity and for the benefit of the rest of us, stipulate that people are imperfect and inconsistent, and in your own right make an effort to recognize when you're taking this stuff personally. NOTHING TO DO WITH CRYPTO is about your feelings, or mine, or anyone else's. When you find ourself using words like "underhanded," "mockery" and "crazy" to describe people talking about concepts few of them understand fully, you're completely missing the point.
I'm telling you to shut up ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. Talk all you want, but there should be a point to it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:21:46
That is not good news
