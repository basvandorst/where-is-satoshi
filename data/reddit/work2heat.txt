You should change that 75% to 99%
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:43:11
So we're still talking about an order of magnitude drop in nodes. I think the point stands. If we can't scale out the "off chain" bitcoin ecosystem (micropayments, exchanges, pegs, change tip etc) fast enough, hell, we don't even deserve bitcoin. Cranking the block size is a cop-out and our kids will call us cowards for it.

you might surprised to discover there is actually no such thing as a bitcoin, there are only transaction inputs and outputs. The way its designed, every input must consist of a previous output, in totality. So if you received 9 BTC all at once, and now you want to spend only 1 BTC, you have to create a new transaction whose input is the 9BTC and whose outputs are to some new address with 1BTC and some other address you control with the other 8BTC. We call that a "change address"

well, come on now, you could query all your peers and see what they converge on...
the only reason I know of for why a node should know its own ip is so it doesn't try to connect to itself. which isn't even the biggest deal.  Is there anything else?
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:27:30
of course - that was the point of using the term, except rather than eventual consistency on a data point when no new updates are made, we're talking about eventual consistency on the chain of history itself.

You make a good point. The best solution here is reputation systems. Of course, that's highly non-trivial - no one knows how to design a good one yet. But with some trusted bootstrapping and a reasonable design, it could all work out.

Python and javascript. 
Python is pretty close to english, there are plenty of crypto tools in python, it has built in big integer capabilities (so you can do crypto without using a library to handle arithmetic with massive integers), and its quick to prototype new things. you can also practically learn the language using the ipython interpreter.  
Javascript is the language of the web, and while less intuitive than python, it comes with all the fun of the browser, so you can make interactive things immediately. Crypto on the web, and the possibilities of client-side crypto (a mostly javascript affair), are obviously massive opportunities. everyone loves a good web interface.
As for how. Codeacademy, khanacademy, wherever. Go through a bunch of tutorials and find what works for you.  Come up with fun little problems and implement them. Factor numbers. Write a simple sha256 miner. make a socket connection.  use a simple web server in python to host your own javascript ;) . StackExchange or someone's blog has the answer to virtually all of your questions (for now).
Most of all, just keep at it, and have fun.

This is a wonderful initiative. 
I've been working on and around ethereum a lot lately, including with the project douglas team. We're interfacing ethereum and bittorrent to form a complete platform for decentralized applications, through 'contract controlled content dissemination` (or c3d) and encrypted (group)chat services.

I'd like to point out a very basic mistake.
The author states, "It can be mathematically proven that given only a synchronous network it is impossible to achieve distributed consensus in a cryptographically guaranteed way [1]"
However, the paper he cites applies to an `asynchronous` network, not a `synchronous` one. Distributed consensus in synchronous environments is actually much easier, though it is probably the case that modern cryptocurrencies fall under the asynchronous model (please correct me if I'm wrong!)
Ie, the abstract:
The consensus problem involves an asynchronous system of processes,some of which may be unreliable. The problem is for the reliable processes to agree on a binary value. In this paper, it is shown that every protocol for this problem has the possibility of nontermination, even with only one faulty process. By way of contrast, solutions are known for the synchronous case, the “Byzantine Generals” problem.
I have other reasons to suspect his conclusions may be wrong, but I will take more time to formulate coherently before dropping here. This simple error is certainly worth correcting!

Here's how bitcoin can help take down cancer.
* step 1: bitcoin spreads as world reserve currency
* step 2: deflationary nature disincentivizes people away from overconsumption and mass production and towards thoughtful savings and investments in both their society and themselves
* step 3: due to step 2, society and people become dramatically healthier
* step 4: cancer no longer so big an issue
Hope that helps.  I totally love molecular biology, but because it's cool, and because the computational infrastructure of the cell is astounding and will move computer science forward in a big way when we get a better handle on the signal processing.  But for cancer? I don't think throwing millions at big labs is the way to do it.  Good luck anyways (and hope you figure out something cool about computation)!

In other words, there are lots of things to be done to pack more in blocks now, at a technical level, before we actually have to consider more economic and philosophical issues.

i can only imagine i2p has their own set of market places and this is unecessary, thus its probably a honeypot/scam. my understanding is i2p is not a proxy, but its own internet - so there's no clean/non-centralized way to get on i2p from clearnet or vice versa. which means you have to use i2p's internal bitcoin, otherwise you have major centralization/trust issues. Is there an exchange for the two? Anyone know about the exchange rate? I have yet to cruise i2p...
please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:32:01
You obviously do not appreciate the value of a fully self contained darknet. Again, I2P was not designed to proxy to the clearnet, so the proper use of I2P, and the proper way to run bitcoin on it, is self contained, and not to sync with the clearnet.

That's brute force "scalability", not scalability by design. It's clumsy and seriously suboptimal and not what an engineer or architect means when he says "scalability".
Anyways, at this point we're going to be running in circles. Solid discussion, but I can't say you've convinced me. I still think she's a baby and our focus ought to be infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure. SV already has its panties wet over this thing with nearly (over?) $100 mil in investments this year. I don't think they're holding off because "oh, the blocksize". I guess we'll see. Would hate to see her crumble because she tried to scale to fast, but equally would hate to see her crumble because she couldn't scale fast enough. Is a tough balance to bridge. Maybe something like 40% increase a year is reasonable. But that's not going to be enough if financial apocolypse looms this year and the bitcoin population doubles or triples or more, will it? The only thing that could support that is a more robust ecosystem, sooner, which is a lot tougher than upping a block size limit. We've still got alot of work todo. Anyways, we should be friends!  on twitter.

ye sure, but I'm giving the I2P people enough credit to assume they wouldnt keep consensus with the clearnet because of the centralization risk through the outproxies. Do you know either way? From what I've heard from an I2P user, they do run their own internal bitcoin, as they should, and as I would expect them to. they probably use a different network number, so the clients wont automatically sync, like for mainnet vs testnet.

I think you got it backwards! You want to take potentially irresponsible measures to continue subsidizing a scarce resource. And you call that "the free market"?! Dear sir, I dare say that Bitcoin's free market economics shine truest when fees rise with volume. The network is very young and needs time to grow responsibly. We are fortunate that such sound economics are already in place, but indeed, it needs to continue to evolve, ie. wallets need smarter fee mechanisms and we need things like segwit, which will double or quadruple the number of txs we can put in a block.

I like "bitcoin is a digital currency not controlled by governments or banks; it allows you to send money anywhere, anytime, to anyone, with no personal information or permission required. It's consensus technology, meaning it only works because thousands of individuals all over the world are collaborating to make it work, like the internet itself. No one is in charge"

In conclusion, it not possible to operate with standard bitcoin over i2p unless you are willing to trust a very small number of individuals with that traffic.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:07:50


My point was that the service bitcoin provides does not accomodate a free market as it is one size fits all. Doesn't care how much security you want or need, its gonna chug a zillion flops and inflate x% no matter what.


Indeed, and I dare say that, regardless of the cost of bandwidth, a larger blocksize will not give us scalability. 7000 computers all crunching the same computation is not scalability. A diverse healthy ecosystem, anchored by a sturdy backbone, and offering services on a spectrum of trust/cost/security/speed is.


Don't underestimate their utter incapacity to regulate the internet. Bittorrent is doing fine, just fine. 


IMO, blocksize pales as a roadblock to adoption in comparison to trust and design. Who can trust this ridiculous currency? Who even knows how to use it? We are so far from mass adoption at a technical, educational, and user-interfacing level that the blocksize isn't even on my radar. I'm on the ground floor trying to get merchants to accept bitcoin. Every person I interact with in the world I inquire about bitcoin. When telemarketers call me, I turn it back on them ("no I don't want insurance, but do you know about bitcoin!"). Half the people don't even know yet, and most of them don't even care. They don't give two shits about a blocksize. You know what they want? They want it to be easy. They want it to be seemless. They want it to fit right in with their existing pos-terminals. They want it to work with their bank accounts. They want it to be insured. Private what now? Multi who? What do you mean if I lose it it's gone? Alas, we're not all anarcho libertarians. But we have much more important things to deal with right now than the block size.

I'm saying a primary use case for Tor is anonymizing your IP address while connecting to sites on the `clearnet` (what most people call the internet). This is done through exit nodes. The network effectively serves as an anonymyzing proxy to other sites on the internet, and you come out an exit node and hit clearnet sites. Hidden services functionality is a separate, additional feature that is not particularly well designed.
I2P does not give a fuck about proxying you to the clearnet. It is an overlay network that provides strong anonymization *within* the I2P network. If certain individuals are kind enough to run proxies to the clearnet or tor, then lucky for you, you can use i2p to access reddit, but this is not a defacto supported functionality in the i2p protocol.
The only way to talk to what you think the bitcoin network is is to funnel traffic through the kind soul proxying i2p to the clearnet or to tor. You think Tor has an exit node problem? I2P has no real concept of exit node - its not desired functionality. Unless/until the I2P community has a strong concern and devoted effort to connect to the clearnet through many users, a service which uses the clearnet bitcoin blockchain on i2p is a bad idea. 
The one thing I'm not clear on is whether or not the I2P community has already undertaken this effort. I don't suspect they have, because they probably don't care - who needs the clearnet anyways :P
Better idea what I'm saying? Still most certainly wrong? Does no one understand how these things work?!
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:27:18
You make a compelling argument. Alas. Modern banking is fragile because it is not exposed to free market forces but pivots around govt regulation and eats at the souls of men. A network centered around a blockchain (rather than regulations) will not have that property. Regulations will be unable to constrain it, nor, as many countries will discover, will it be desirable to do such a thing.
However, Bitcoin is poorly designed. It is incapable of being a network for all, since it offers a single one size fits all solution for every single possible use case and has none of the flexibility in quality of service demanded by a free market, especially one seemingly beset to *be for all*. 
This is not about bitcoin. It's about the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is the awkward pubescent teenager proposing an alternative way of working with the world. It would terrible of us to thrust her into marriage, a career, and having children before she's even gone to college. She needs time to feel this out, to build a support network, to make friends and grow relationships and figure out who she is before she rushes into the adult life of mass adoption. Other wise she might burn out and die before she ought to.


Nonetheless, there are still *no* incentives to run a full node, and larger blocks mean more resources, for all 7000 or so nodes. How many of those poor, brave, thankless souls do you think will stick around? I booted up a new full node yesterday. I'm watching blocks roll in. I would not be pleased if they were much larger. 


Have faith. Governments are virtually incapable of squashing this thing, unless suddenly the number of agents running nodes drops off to a number the governments can target. We are 6 years old. A lot more slow and steady growth is warranted before we can even imagine "mass adoption". Patience, my friend.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:32:36
"parkway". I rest my case.
Also, what's in a name? Can you define proxy? Does the common use of tor as a way to anonymize yourself while browsing the regular internet satisfy that definition? These are important questions to ask yourself when arguing about something you don't fully understand.

a series of central points of failure is not a central point of failure, least of all for the network as a whole. The blocksize may rise much more rapidly than bandwidth. there is still no incentive to run a node. larger blocksizes is even less incentive. and besides, bitcoin is an obscenity: most of the transactions on the bitcoin network do not require anything near the quantity of security provided. it's inefficient overkill. bitcoin becomes much more scalable and healthy with a strong off chain transaction ecosystem. we need to start promoting that and get real with modern world infrastructure and a steady transition to cryptoeconomic payment systems  
a block size fork poses a real threat to bitcoins existence, especially given the clear lack of consensus in the community. this is consensus tech. if we can't reach a clear consensus (clearly, we can't), it should not happen.

While I agree in general, I believe getting banks working with the blockchain is something like a trojan horse. The blockchain's chief characteristics of decentralization, transparency, security, autonomy will be a never ending pressure on the foundation of the banking enterprise that will, I believe, give way. There will still be companies administering, and abiding government regulations (as, to some extent, there should be, you know, so long as we have governments), but the result will be far superior to what we have today.

Ah of course. It's because you're obsessed with abstract and misleading notions of value and scarcity. Yes bitcoin is scarce, and thats part of what makes it valuable, but it doesn't begin to be the whole story. The whole story is one about distributed network protocols, open source software development, and software-based community governance. That ecosystem will not get a chance to mature if it is confined entirely to Bitcoin. It needs to breath and incorporate ideas from elsewhere, be challenged and tested, especially at this early stage of the game. Proliferation of crypto currencies has not done damage to Bitcoin - in fact, the fact that Ethereum was around to soak up the Hearn-induced bitcoin collapse was probably great for cryptosystems, if not bitcoin itself. Have no fear, competition is a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 08:40:16
block propogation. the incentive to mine in pools comes from two places: 1) variance in payouts 2) orphaned blocks.
the 1st means you make the same amount of money but you make it more regularly when you're in a pool. I don't think its affected by blocksize
the 2nd means you lose money if you produce blocks that other people don't build on. this happens when you don't hear about new blocks early enough. with bigger block sizes, it takes longer to hear about blocks, so it becomes even harder to mine as an independent, since your orphan rate goes up the further you are from the big mining pools. so bigger blocks just create more incentive for larger pools, and for the pools to have very strong network connections to eachother (so they can hear about eachothers blocks right away)

No, in principle we shouldn't, but we have to be cognizant of the fact that bitcoin nodes are 100% volunteer. We've already seen their numbers drop an order of magnitude in the last couple years. I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen again with larger blocks. And that would be a catastrophe.

While I think you're probably right, consider the state of bitcoin: a month ago we forked because miners who voted for stricter signature validation failed to do the validation. Changes to the protocol are risky - very risky. And the economics of the system are still poorly understood, despite any claims to the contrary. And bigger blocksizes will create centralization imperatives as much as the lightning network will if not more - my node has enough trouble keeping up as it is. With 8MB blocks, I wouldn't be running one.
Now, while we're conspiring about incentives, keep in mind both Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen's ties to government and corporate worlds. Recall Gavin's meeting with the spooks a few years ago. For all we know, he's working undercover for them to destabilize bitcoin - his actions over the last year do not seem to contradict this (eg. "forgetting" that RAM is a thing, conducting scalability analysis without considering security, etc.). 
The risks here are enormous - this is easily the greatest techno-political dilemma for decentralized systems since bittorrent had to figure out how to do its thing without trackers. And this time there's $4 billion on the line. Bittorrent was lucky to have a logarithmic scaling profile (ie. a DHT). Linear hash chains bear no such advantage (every node carries the same load, regardless). The lightning network is genuinely good for bitcoin. A rift in the community caused by BitcoinXT is genuinely not. 
What we need more than anything is a greater pool of competent dev expertise. Education, education, education. 
In the meantime, I'm still voting for CEO of bitcoin. And obviously Bernie4President.

How is it a chance to break bitcoin? It's an aggressive, untested increase in assumed capability of the network. Bitcoin does not have a particularly good record of making updates without problems. Switching to leveldb in 2013, which should have been trivial, caused the chain to fork. And miners voting for upgrades to signature verification (bip66) but who weren't doing what they were supposed to forked the chain this summer. In the face of such blunders, XT appears very dangerous indeed!

Actually, hubs are just for connecting people, and don't require any btc themselves. The actual participants in the channel are who requires btc. If you and I were close friends, we could open a payment channel between ourselves with 1 transaction on the bitcoin blockchain, and pass btc back and forth on it indefinitely without any other 3rd party. The hubs are useful for connecting many channels so that for example, if I end up sending all my money to you, I could receive more money on another channel and forward that to you as well without having to make another transaction on the chain

In theory you're right. In practice the community has managed to establish in the past that the longest PoW chain is not the correct chain (ie. a month ago re bip66). So in this case, even if the BitcoinXT manages a majority of hashing power, if the community rejects it, they can happily stay on Bitcoin Core. Of course it means Bitcoin Core can be attacked, so community would have to deal with that somehow ...

I love how well this demonstrates the importance of miners running validation, and of how nothing within the protocol itself forces miners to make blocks with valid transactions.
It's also a lesson in voting: if you vote for something, make sure you know what you're doing!
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:13:51
To make proof of stake work you need security deposits. Validators put up a security deposit to be eligible to sign off on blocks (and reap tx fees). If a validator is found to sign on two blocks at the same height, they lose their deposit.
This solves the short-term nothing at stake problem. To deal with it over the long term, you need what Vitalik calls "weak subjectivity", ie. you need to authenticate a state hash *just once* out of band. It's quite similar to making sure you have the correct genesis block in bitcoin when you download the software the first time (maybe your TLS connection to github was compromised!). In any event, as a light client, once you authenticate the hash once (by calling your friends, checking at the grocery store, on reddit, whatever), you simply need to come online at least once every X months to keep up with changes to the validator set. Then you get all the security that is on deposit and there is no chance of "costless simulation" or "nothing at stake" unless some significant fraction of validator deposits are destroyed (ie. the cryptoeconomic security guarantee).

Actually, about a total of 7 people control bitcoin, and to ignore that reality is incredibly naiive. If it weren't for the extremely small number of people who control it, bitcoin would be dead by now, because it never would have recovered from the multiple forks its had in its life, which have only been resolved because the small number of people in control were able to co-ordinate rapidly. 
It is nice to play make-believe sometimes tho.

they cant be trusted because of systematic dishonesty. they may be inefficient, but the real problem is they're lying about it! It appears Bernie Sanders is an honest man. The only candidate without a superPAC. Consistent on civil and human rights for decades. If he's gonna take money out of the military and use it to send kids to school (so they can learn to program and help make bitcoin better too!) then let's do it!

Wrong. Bernie doesn't want to fight the business man. He wants to fight the "business-thats-too-big-to-fail" man. He is a *strong* supporter of small business and businesses that, you know, actually create wealth rather than liquidate it into a billionaire's pocket.
The way I see, left/right doesn't capture the political divide anymore. Today the only distinction that really matters is "those that support big banks that are too big to fail" and those that do not. Bernie is emphatically one that does not.

its not. that ipfs namespace is exactly the value the decerver is adding. there's an ipfs module wrapper under the hood that exports a "filesystem" interface to the decerver's javascript runtime, allowing you to push files with just that command. the idea is that for each different filesystem or blockchain we provide a little module wrapper that gets bound into the js runtime so the decerver can communicate between them.

what if we convince miners to additionally run btcd and libbitcoin with bitcoin core, benefiting both from robustness and decentralization of source code control. Though I don't know much about where the conformal team's funding comes from, and I suppose the funding of libbitcoin might be unsteady.
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:01:59
the point is that as we move towards a many chains internet, we want a blockchain client that can handle more than one chain, so you don't have to download new software everytime you want to connect to a new blockchain (imagine having to download a new browser for every website). That is the long term goal of the thelonious project, though we are still a ways off.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:25:02
`Bitcoin is decentralized, but not enough for contracts until transaction malleability is fixed.`
Agreed. But it's more even than transaction malleability. Until ASICs are commodity hardware and come with every new macbook, bitcoin will be mostly centralized. Most of the devs are funded either by the bitcoin foundation or blockstream, and their associated corporate interests. Mining is controlled by a very small number of people. And most of the hardware comes out of a single factory in china. Woe is us.
We are using ethereum's baseline design. We are not committed to their particular platform. Their economics are irrelevant to us. What matters to us is that there is some Big Bad Public Blockchain (BBPB) that we can trickle hashes up into. Bitcoin will do just fine, but it'd be nice to have a cleaner contracting/scripting system like ethereum. And I dare say its not vaporware. Have you played with the tech? It's actually quite beautiful. The only shame is they are trying to do too much at once.
Tell me, how do I use the term blockchain technology inappropriately? Does the bitcoin network have a monopoly on that term? How do I apply to be granted the privilege of trying to place it in the context of 30 years of research on distributed consensus and byzantine actors?

first of all, the point of thelonious is scriptable consensus. so you can have pow just like bitcoin, or you can lock it down so only 7 people can mine, or you can have it so 7 people can mine but they can open it up over time to make it fully public. whatever you want.
oh by the way, 7 people mining is still better than bitcoin, where there is effectively only 3. Sorry your hero of decentralization is hardly decentralized at all. such a shame.

You may not be able to have a decentralized authority blockchain without a currency, but you may be able to have one with a currency that is not itself native to the chain, in the sense that it is merely a recognized representative of a fiat currency.  It's like a blockchain between a known group of people (not of a single organization, so not inherently trustful), where the "commit" authority is decentralized among them, and where the currency is a legally recognized digital representative of fiat denominated bonds held on deposit by trusted third parties (including even a BBPB, like Bitcoin - though in realty right now no lucid businessman should hold their balances in bitcoin, as it's volatility can be crippling). 
I especially like this idea because it promotes the notion that organizations may come about for the sake of (and possibly dissolve following) a particular project, rather than existing as exclusive membership clubs with unparticipatory stake holders (ie modern businesses). And they don't need to throw down ridiculous compute power or indulge a new currency market to secure it, if they can fall back on enforceable legal agreements defined in large part by programmed contracts. Crowd funding is beginning to take us in this direction, but the organizational/coordination overhead is still tremendous, and the legaltech still needs to catch up.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:47:05
that being said, we are not only building a generalized blockchain client. The [decerver]( is a distributed application server that allows you to work with bitcoin, ethereum, thelonious, and ipfs all through javascript. Our token example is [2gather]( a decentralized youtube where video is stored on ipfs and tracked in ethereum contracts (well, thelonious). It's practically a working decentralized pirate bay. Did you not come across 2gather or the decerver in your digging?

Simple saying "its open source" doesn't mean anyone can compete. The barrier to entry is now thousands of dollars. You cannot ignore the reality of mining farms and asic factories. Yes, bitcoin is in its infancy. I have faith in PoW iff the hardware commoditizes so that any average user can mine without spending thousands of dollars or renting space from a centralized organization.
I still don't follow. You can hash data and record the hash on bitcoin. The hash is secured by the bitcoin blockchain for perpetuity. As long as I at one point knew which bitcoin address to look at, I'm good to go.
How is the reality of bitcoin mining today any less apartheid than PoS?

I agree that there are some problems with the amount of copy we have. it can be easy to get lost and hard to find what you're looking for. we will work on that.
the point of the helloworld tutorial was to demonstrate integrations between ipfs and a blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:45:09
Until mining hardware is comoditized, it will be controlled by a very small number of organizations that maintain the infrastructure. the original dream was "one cpu, one vote", which is clearly no longer true, especially given large pools, asic farms, and massive asic factories that produce significant fractions of the hardware. Bitcoin mining today is anything but decentralized.
As for the BBPB, not sure I understand your argument; I would be grateful if you'd clarify. What I'm saying is that we can push merkle roots from the weak chain onto a BBPB and forever after be able to request preimages. If they cant answer the request, we know they've tampered with the data and they shall be smitten by the hand of zeus. 
For the record, blockchains are not the first solution to the byzantine generals problem, which has been studied in the distirbtued consensus literature for 30 years. they may be the first solution for decentralized digital currencies, though, and bitcoin offers a unique solution that purports to provide 2f+1 security (rather than the classical 3f+1), though even that can be called into question by certain mining attacks which allege you only need around 30% of the mining power to do damage. It has been easy in the past to achieve this (though things look a bit better now).
Finally, as for PoW vs PoS, we could increase bitcoin's security (ie. the cost to gain a controlling share of the voting power) by an order of magnitude by moving to PoS. Bitcoin mining operations are estimated at a few hundred million dollars, the market cap is a few billion. Daily tx volume appears to be under $100 million, so we could have a few billion dollars worth of bitcoin in validator's surety bonds. thats 10x more security at a fraction of the cost (no more wasteful mining). We could also just quit it with the inflation and pay validators in transaction fees. Tada! Bitcoin is saved :P

"smart contract" to me means "stored procedure call + verifiable code execution". ie you can audit the actual execution of the code. you don't *necessarily* need money. if you want it to be legally recognized as a "contract", then sure, you need to legally or socioeconomically integrate a store of value.
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:26:06
let's take an example from history. march 2013 bitcoin blockchain forks because of a bug. thank god there were so few people in charge of basically all bitcoin mining, so that the core devs could call them up and say "hey guys, we need you to switch software asap to save the system". centralization is sometimes a virtue. but now imagine someone calls them up and says "here's $5 billion dollars, break bitcoin". bitcoin miners don't have enough at stake - that's the real problem.
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:57:33
Except miners today pose a massive counterparty risk, especially since they pool into *very small numbers* of *very large groups*. yikes! also, the technologies you cite have failed *time and time again* to provide the transparency and auditability we desire. if you don't think we can do *way better*, I feel sorry for your pessimistic soul :)
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:27:46
not necessarily. that's the point.  consider any large scale business deal that may involve anywhere from a few to dozens of organizations to complete. Whether its a construction deal involving construction companies, architects, consultants, law firm, city officials, etc., or a food supply contract involving farmers, truckers, distributors, grocery stores, etc. Having the process co-ordinated across a standardized authenticated database could do wonders for society's ability to audit those details and keep the players honest.

its not so much about loops as it is about contracts that you can call that can call other contracts. with persistence and cunning you can put contracts on bitcoin's blockchain but there is no mechanism for them to call other contracts. that is THE advantage of ethereum (along with various design improvements like the god damned state trie root in the header!)

That's not true. The eris chain software (thelonious) allows you to encode your own rules abotu the chain. So you can launch a standard PoW chain (though good luck finding enough miners), or you can lock it down so only say the following 6 people can mine, and you can bring in more miners over time. The point of the eris blockchain ( is to bring the consensus rules into the blockchain's virtual machine - to have them scripted! If you can't see the value in that, well, I feel sorry for you.

dht's don't provide contract like code execution and storage. since everything in a dht is content addressable, there is no "central" place to store the hash of the latest update. This is the perfect job for an ethereum contract. You make an update to some file, push it to the dht, and store the new hash in an ethereum contract. This is exactly what Eris does in it's Hello World Dapp ( except using thelonious for the blockchain and IPFS as the dht

bernaenke has the same effect on the market that a dealer has on his clients (the addicts).  So long as he's in town and supplied (printing money), everyone gets to shoot up and get high.  But the mere threat of him going to his cottage for a weekend and leaving his clients dry causes a sudden panic, motivating everyone to stop what they are doing, hold their drugs, try and put off getting high, and perhaps, if they're lucky, go to a meeting.  all of this equates to flops in stock indices and bond markets, and everyone holding a little tighter to their slightly more valuable dollar.
Of course all of this was just on account of a threat...
