Why? Just because you (i mean the company, not you personally) wouldn't want to bother?
I can speak for myself. My deposit came in the 17ish UTC and wasn't even credited to my account. That tells me you already knew something was going wrong but did nothing to warn users not to deposit, or simply hide deposit section on the website if you didn't have exact words to warn.
Then you got a load of such deposits from people who don't understand why they are not credited, writing messages to support &amp; here, and after that the platform halts.
So it shocks me *why* do you think these funds which arrived in your posession due to your procrastination to communicate, and never stolen, are not going to have special treatment? May be you have a good reason for that, but I can't understand how this view could be promoted at all.

thank you for supporting my question. I think so as well: what wasn't credited to accounts can not be calculated for socializing loss.

I have posted similar thoughts here 
and some other people agreed with me there.
Zane answered not substantially, and tried to avoid confiscation/haircut topic completely. Looks like, it is not known yet what they will do, but the danger for late deposits I estimate as high, which is sad.

What was in the response?

Finally got e-mail and approved the btc withdrawal. When can I expect it to arrive?

Sorry Zane, but it's not a full quote present in you comment, and thus not accurate.
Another question from *tohico* was:
"And in case of socializing funds or insolvency, will those late deposits be used for it as well?"
I think the users want to know if you are going to include the late deposits, which the exhange didn't want or wasn't able to stop between the wallets froze and platfrom halt, in the probably serious funds haircut.
I understand that you can't guarantee anything right now as you prepare the announcement, not finalized etc. Many times written and read. But it's not good to tell "no special treatment" then as well. Which I believe would be unfair and makes an impression this deposit collection was done consciously for that.

On the 10th click it sort of worked.
Shows now it's pending and I should have an email.
While I don't have such.

Withdrawals don't really work. Shame

No. Even unconfirmed transaction doesn't show yet. I hope BFX will process it soon.
