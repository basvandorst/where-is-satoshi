Their are micronations that manage to run independently and with the backing of cryptocurrency we have a better chance than any other micronation.

This is important because regular databases that hold the lists of people waiting in line are never transparent and can be gamed by people with connections/money so they can skip in line. The problem of fraud is magnified here because kidney transplants deal with peoples lives and a fair transparent blockchain is sorely needed.  Fraud will not be possible with our blockchain since it's immutable and it's easy to see what number in line someone is. 
There will also be a smart contract to help incompatible partners receive compatible kidneys. Let’s say Bob’s wife needs a kidney transplant, but she’s blood type B and he’s blood type A. Then let’s say Amanda’s brother needs a kidney transplant, but he’s blood type A and she’s blood type B. With the kidney swap smart contract Amanda would be able to be Bob’s wife’s donor and Bob would be able to be Amanda’s brothers donor. The smart contract could transparently pair groups of two or even more than two groups together to make it easier for people to receive the life saving kidney they need.

Sadly most legacy healthcare databases are extremely unreliable. A simple list on the internet that isn't immutable can be altered and then there is the plethora of healthcare institutes being hit with ransomware that takes a lot of their databases offline and makes them unrecoverable. 
Another problem in the healthcare industry is overcharging, if you have ever seen the bill for a hospital visit you will understand how big of a problem it is. Healthcare institutions spend an exceedingly high amount of money maintaining these faulty databases when the move to an immutable blockchain would be both safer and cheaper.

This could really put people new to the bitcoin and crypto space off so please discourage this kind of activity in the community.
