so the the mining companies now make more money from the transaction fees than the actual release of bitcoin is that correct? if so my question has been answered

hmmm but it wont be long until they try and tax your wins like regular stocks if they have all your info, I am guessing they don't already do this due to it being anonymous (once you convert back into your currency of choice that is)

Bitcoin is not a currency at this point the only reason it is being accepted as a currency by some companies I presume they think they can hold for a while and sell it at a higher price, as a currency I cant see it working

Okay thankyou for your help, the only other thing that worries me about bitcoin is for it to be used for mainstream transactions such as buying video games and buying your groceries it needs to hit stable ground, I know that this past year bitcoin has really had a huge amount of interest and at the rate its going I don't see it hitting a stable ground for a long long time, what are your opinions on this, when do you think bitcoin could really make an appearance in our everyday life (not just on the internet)

The whole purpose of the experiment was for it to be untraceable and untaxable

Steam has stopped accepting bitcoin due to the high fees, and I don't think that is quite the same bitcoin is ment to be a currency you are effectively cashing out some of your bitcoin with the bank to trade it for AUD so its not really the same as spending bitcoin

i am replying to all the comments here, if i am not mistaken it is boasted about how little the transactons fees are to send money ect, so either the fees will have to be increased or a mining company (or transaction company) will have to have a huge amount of computer power to earn a decent amount of money
