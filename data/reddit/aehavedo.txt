I added a USD version to the post. 
Anyway changing the currency actually changes which prices are pulled from CoinMarketCap, but the currency in google sheets you'd need to update manually since it's just presentation.

Cryptoscripts is just the name I gave to the script on the sheet. Google asks you for permission to run because the sheet adds the book price and a timestamp in the "transactions" sheet automatically when you enter a transaction.
There is nothing shady in the code as you can see.

Hi! To be honest I was inspired by your sheet to make mine. I would like to see your improved sheet if you don't mind sharing. :)

I believe that was only the titles. The actual values were already in USD. I updated it anyway:)

I suppose it could. I would have done it in excel if VBA wasn't such a pain in the arse. 
I never worked with Open though.

Hey! You can take a look at the script. It's just pulling data from CoinMarketCap. It does nothing on your computer :)

Hey. What error are you getting?
I tried entering request-network on column B and it gets the price just fine.
