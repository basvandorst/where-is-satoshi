thanks for adding that last sentence in your reply.  i'm really trying to distill this down into a method that, assuming i don't understand the change wallet issue and assuming i don't want to wrap my mind around it, will be a fool-proof way to store and retrieve the purchasing power of my coins.

i'll believe it when i see it.  many reasons to doubt the coinlab thing will materialize.  and if it does there's no reason to think they won't make the gox situation worse. to the extent they communicate their plans at all (which isn't much), they voice wide-eyed enthusiasm about the Gox trading platform.  they are newbs to high-volume trading platforms. and they only have a few hundred thousand dollars worth of financing.  amateur hour.  the foremost BTC trading platform in the US deserves top notch adult supervision from people who actually know what they're doing.  not this shit.

i think he is referring to the go-live date for trading BTC on that site.

Coinlab's silence is deafening. what are they hiding?

They claim to have landed a deal with a bona fide US bank - Silicon Valley bank -- to smooth the transition from USD to BTC. Nothing to stop Gox from doing same with any bank in world serving US customers.

Gox has enough money/ investment interest to get some serious help from counsel in complying with US regulatory issues. Lawyers only charge $500/hour - drop in bucket compared to selling out US business to  CoinLab.

I am having the same experience.  i sent an email to their support desk asking for an update and all they would tell me is they'd let me know when they're done. like many here, i am trying to migrate away from Gox, but at the end of the day, i'll go where i can get the job done.  Gox is the closest thing to that for me right now (I'm in USA).

which would only require partnership with existing US legal entity or forming a new one -- trivial hurdles.

Can we persuade him to tweet some bitcoin love to his 14.2 million twitter followers? Imagine the exposure that would bring bitcoin.
