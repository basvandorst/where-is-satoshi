If you think Trump and others in the government don’t own Crypto..wake up! 
It’s why the CFTC turned a blind eye, that was all the Trump endorsement I needed to see. 
Since he didn’t come out and say Bitcoin is “fake money” lol. We’re good! His silence on the issue, says “I like Bitcoin”

Lets be honest, all forms of investing outside maybe Mutual Funds is gambling. 
As “Tin Foil” as this article is, there are valid points asserted in the article. 
One thing I will say, Bitcoin was a first of its kind. I wouldn’t be surprised if a coin we aren’t even DISCUSSING, shows up in the mix. (That would be a curveball)
My natural pessimism, says this article is TRUE, my holdings say it’s FUD...
Is the truth somewhere in the middle?
