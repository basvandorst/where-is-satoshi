It's not a good incentive, because inflation increases disproportionally tax revenue due to tax brackets and nominal limits.

Well there is a legal way to avoid the taxes. It seems to be tax free until $14000, so by having 100 friends to buy you stuff, you can spend $1.4M every year up to $5.49M.

Do you pay capital gains if you trade pokemon cards? It is not possible to tax btc-to-goods transactions legally before Bitcoin is legal tender. If any government tries to do it, you should sue the government.

What if you give your friend the 0.02 BTC, who is also American and he/she immediately uses it to purchase the pizza with the 0.02 BTC? I see also many other problems in this interpretation of taxation, so I hope someone goes to court to challenge this, because that is very unreasonable.

The increase in difficulty doesn't increase the energy consumption per transaction. The difficulty adjusts to keep the block time stable, so the only thing increasing the energy consumption is the amount of mining hardware mining bitcoin. In the future there will be hopefully hundreds or thousands times more transactions per block and it's not economically sustainable for the same increase in mining hardware, so the energy consumed per transaction will be a fraction of what it is now.

I'm not an U.S. citizen, but do you really pay taxes on gifts? So when does the IRS raid every home after Christmas?
If I would have to pay taxes on every BTC transaction, that would mean I would have to pay taxes on every transaction done on any currency, object, service or work. It would mean that you would have to pay taxes if you agree to cut down your neighbor's fence at summer if he then shovel your snow in the winter. I think that is the exact definition of unreasonable. It would be reasonable, if you could pay the taxes in BTC, so it would be 0.02 * capital gains tax.

Ok, guy. If you haven't noticed, most of us live in a democracy. The government cannot just raise taxes. In fact, the fed has been encouraging inflation for 10 years straight with repeated QE and zero interest rates. The EU is even worse in that regard. It's ridiculous to say the government isn't incentivised to encourage inflation for it to pay off its debt and increase tax revenue. All this happens to the cost of the tax payer.

There is no fundamental problem with a deflationary currency. It would in fact encourage into a much more sustainable economic development. The prices of goods and services will lead to an equilibrium at some point, where it is beneficial for both parties to do an exchange. Just hoarding currency doesn't provide happiness, but spending it on things will. The biggest obstacles are psychological and are entirely possible to overcome.

99% of people just don't understand how our currencies work. When they do, they will realize how unfair and unsustainable the system is and start to search for alternatives. There are many motives for me to be excited about Bitcoin, but one of the important ones are control over my personal possessions and distrust in fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:41:07
Yes the IRS tells you to pay taxes on it, but I see no chances of it holding up in court if they try to prosecute on it. You could even complain to the world human rights court of it.

Pay capital gains and reinvest? That is a 20-30% guaranteed loss depending on where you live. That would enable Bitcoin to drop 30% and never recover to be a better option and I see that extremely unlikely when you consider it as a long term investment.

We are talking about a store value, that requires no interaction on your part. I don't know what you consider to be the best fiat currency, but got example US dollar has lost 96% of its value along the years. In my opinion it has failed long ago as a store of value. 
The same applies to Euro and the national currencies, which preceded Euro. Most of their value has disappeared due to inflation and if you failed to convert the national currency to Euros in time, they would be now worthless.
So all in all the 27 years is not at all biased.

The ideal purpose is great, but it doesn't work in reality. There is absolutely no incentive for the government to take money out of the economy in growth stages and that's why we have enormous bubbles &amp; crashes. The inflationary model is not sustainable for the planet we live in, neither is it sustainable economically.

If you can afford it go for the M3, they're prices are appreciating rapidly for a good reason - it's the best M3 to date. 330 ci is a good budget option and propably will appreciate in value as well if well maintained.

I'm from Finland so it's not the go-to option. The "safe" option is to invest in the Finnish stocks and the biggest company was Nokia in 2006. It's easy to say in hindsight it wasn't a good purchase, but it was a sure bet back then.

Have you calculated the miner in the sum? The miner is still an asset that has value and can be realized quite easily.

That was my whole point. I think you must not believe in the community if you are just here for the bucks. What is your threshold to go back to bucks? What will you do if the dollar value of Bitcoin keeps rising after that? I'm assuming your investment span is over just few months, because if you believe in the community, but don't believe Bitcoin succeeding in it's ultimate goal, there must be a tipping point. But if you are greedy and the value just keeps rising we might be in a situation where there is no return to the dollar economy.
I'm am not saying you should go all in for Bitcoin, but it would be wise to think about the action plan if you are a long term investor/speculator. Turning your Bitcoins into real estate or shares of a company would be much less contradicting than Dollars.

But then you will still get burned in the end. This approach works in VC investing, where you usually invest mainly in the people and it doesn't matter if the initial product fails. In bitcoin, you are investing in the product, not the people. So even if you believe in the people behind the product, but the product fails, you will not profit.
Then if you fundamentally don't believe in Bitcoin and it turns out to be a much bigger disruption than anyone imagined, you will still lose because you will assess at some point it is overvalued and take your profits out. In that case you transfer your "bets" on the losing side again.

I guess it is a little misleading, but my point was that there is a lot of risk involved in the stock market. It may average around 7% annually, but if you get extremely unlucky with timing, like in 1929, you would need to wait 25 years to break even. 
I think of myself as a rational investor and with the current market situation Bitcoin has one of the lowest risk/reward ratios. I think it is more than evident we are due for a major correction in the stock market, bonds are in the longest bull market ever and the real estate prices are totally unobtainable with average household incomes around the world. That leaves us basically with commodities and cryptos. Cryptos have bigger risk with a bigger reward, while investments to precious metals, oil and food supplies are less volatile.

I will never convert my BTC into fiat. I'm already paying all my bills with BTC. Just like if I buy a litre of apple juice and exchange it to orange juice you don't pay taxes. You only have to pay taxes on gains when converting back to your governments issued currency (at least according EU legislation) and since I will never do that there's zero taxes to be paid.

At least the U.S stock market has zero chances of going up 50 % before a major correction. The only stocks keeping it afloat are the FAANGMT. The rest of S&amp;P 500 are stagnant or declining. The Russell 3000 is even more worrying. The FED has a massive balance sheet of equities they will start to unload at the moment. If you look at the P/E ratios, they are mainly delusional. The shorts are at a 8-year record high. There is really very little room to grow with massive risks of a serious downturn. It's definitely not anything close to safe at the moment.

The stock market is doing all time highs weekly right now, bonds have been in a bull market for over 30 years, real estate is globally in the biggest bubble ever. Bank accounts have negative interest rates. It's like choosing between guaranteed loss or a high yield high risk investment. There is no good reason to ban for only a suggestion to the best performing asset during the last 9 years.
