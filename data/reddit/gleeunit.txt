Ok this is pretty much what I was asking about.. still wrapping my head around the mining side of things and how they relate to the size of the network.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:22:41
Ok, thank you.  Appreciate the answer.

I know, FUD/media-pile-ons drive me nuts sometimes too.  Just some friendly feedback from a fellow enthusiast though... not everyone asking a question is trying to spread FUD.  I really just want to understand this stuff better, and there are very few places I can go for answers and knowledgeable discussion.  I’d imagine that’s true for the honest majority of people on here.

So yeah, that’s the big part of my question - I have limited understanding of what the network “spends” energy on, or whether that expenditure would track with the size of the network.  I figured that as more transactions take place more frequently, more energy would be required at some stage in the process, but I’m not clear on whether that’s true, false, or somewhere in between.

Can you go a little deeper into this?  Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:17
So is the implication then that miners (who we expect to be rational) will get out of the business as competition increases, because the cost of electricity will be such that mining will no longer be profitable at some point?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:48
Yeah I specifically said I didn’t want to talk about the environment in my post, thx tho
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:25:42
Well as long as my buffoons are safe.

As a noob... I'm commenting to bookmark this so I can read it after work.

That's probably exactly why the guy upthread says he's fallen out of love with this sub, I'd imagine.

This is a circle jerk shitpost that has absolutely nothing to do with the technology, trading, adoption, or use of Bitcoin.  It's entirely devoid of any value, and does nothing for anyone who isn't already neck-deep in this kind of "world against us" mindset, and for many, makes this community look like paranoid weirdos.  It's fine if you want to jack off to your "down with the media oppressors" cartoons, but if you think you're helping bitcoin's cause, you're mistaken.  What's more, it's a repost.  
But hey, post another meme, you're doing great.
@_date: 2019-02-01 00:10:02
Do you really think this type of attitude helps the cause?  Telling people they’re probably going to kill themselves unless they do what you say?  You’re not helping.  These types of comments, yours and the one I originally responded to, are what make everyday people think we’re a bunch of fucking weirdos and stifles adoption and the growth of the community.  The growth that we HAVE seen is in spite of this bullshit, not because of.
Also, I hope you can recognize the irony in calling ME patronizing (by the way, the 2 million people OP mentions would be 0.000026% of the global population - I’m comfortable calling that “vanishingly small”) and then immediately labeling me a no-coiner.   I just don’t think that holding bitcoin is going to fully insulate us from  some economic judgement day that leaves 99.999974% of humanity in poverty while we enlightened few sip piña coladas on private islands, spared the inconvenience of a global financial collapse.  Come on, dude.  
If you actually care about this stuff, and if you really do think that it’s a good way to help people diversify and protect themselves from economic turbulence, GREAT.  I couldn’t agree more.  But try helping people to understand it and join in, don’t issue prophecies of their destitution and death if they don’t.  You catch more flies with honey, and we don’t have nearly enough flies yet.

But wait where do we get the drugs
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:03:50
Wait.  I want to make sure I understand.  
You think that everyone who doesn’t own bitcoin is going to starve and die, that the vanishingly small percentage of people who do own it will somehow remain miraculously unaffected by the circumstances leading to this massive global societal collapse, and that those people will then lead the next phase of humanity into some sort of decentralized economic utopia on Earth?  Interesting.

Yeah he thinks that's all his though.

I know there are other options that technically exist, but very, very few people use that in reference to the price.  My question is, when would it be appropriate for major consumer-facing platforms (I tend to use Coinbase as an example) to start using "satoshis" as opposed to Bitcoins in their interfaces?  And what would the effects be?
