Clearly the brief rally is over. What triggered it in the first place? The announcement of Libra? Whale manipulation? Only good thing is that it didn't last long enough to trigger any media attention. I hope this isn't the shape of things to come... few days of pump, then a bloodbath. What's the point of Bitcoin then, other than another asset to be endlessly pumped and dumped by whales and the wealthy? Not feeling great about Bitcoin's future anymore... to be honest.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:32:15
WOW! What is going on? Trump and the Fed officially tanked Bitcoin's "rally"!
It's looking like a seriously looooong road ahead for Bitcoin and crypto. Just WOW! Not good at all....
@_date: 2019-07-13 19:08:12
Very well said!
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:04:53
I'm not saying these countries should replace their currency "overnight", but move in that direction cautiously. I agree Bitcoin is way too volatile right now. But as it's use and popularity grows and the price stabilizes, that's a different story. Maybe it stabilizes at $1M, $10M, $100M per coin... who knows?
At that point, wouldn't the country with the largest reserves of Bitcoin be in a great position?
What's the alternative... stay trapped in the current fiat system forever?
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:08:29
I’m a little confused about something… if Bitcoin is a “global” asset/property/currency, how can U.S. regulators hold so much power and influence over it? Are other countries going to be bound by these U.S. rules and regulations? Or are all these regulations to control it so that it’s legal to buy/sell/trade on U.S. crypto exchanges? In any case, it seems like overregulation is going to kill Bitcoin fast, doesn’t it?
Why not let Bitcoin continue on as a wild, speculative asset, and stop the talk of it replacing the dollar…. which it never will anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:01:13
Just a general question about Trump's and Mnuchin's remarks: why is everyone waiting for the US and the Fed to give Bitcoin and cryptos their "endorsement"? Wouldn't that be like Coca-Cola having a press conference to tell everyone how great Pepsi is? Of course they're going fight for the dollar to the bitter end!
Secondly, isn't this a once in a lifetime opportunity for other countries to even the playing field (China, Russia, Iran, South America) by going full bore on Bitcoin? It would do away with the constant threat of US sanctions as a means of financial control. Why should the US and World Bank get to dictate what's "good" and what's "bad", as far as global currency? I'm starting to think that Bitcoin is WAY undervalued, like its value and potential is being heavily suppressed...
@_date: 2019-07-27 12:03:03
That's scary to think... no buyers left... especially at this relatively early stage. If Bitcoin can't attract buyers now, what does that mean for its future?
Not trying to give in to the FUD, but it's getting more and more difficult to see Bitcoin rocketing up in value or everyday use any time soon. All the dips are making the April "rally" look weaker every day, like it never had any legs...
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:32:11


:) So glad to see 12k broken today!
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:47:55
Any specific reason why 12k is such a hurdle the last several days? There's a ton of resistance at 12k, but it seems like such an arbitrary number... I could see 15k, then 20k...
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:24:56
WTF? Anyone have any ideas about what's going on? Another $600+ drop overnight. Is this more consolidation before a "real" bull run, or are people losing interest in Bitcoin?
Starting to think that maybe the real treasure is the blockchain, and Bitcoin is just going to die a slow, painful death... negative press, overregulation, stagnation, heavy dips.
Anyone have a good idea where we're heading? Not trying to be negative, but I'm starting to get really discouraged...
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:36:03
Any thoughts on the stall and drop? Trump's negative comments? More consolidation? People on summer vacations?
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:49:25
Yeah, but Bitcoin has much more exposure now than it did 10 years ago, and one would hope, much more interest... and the price is as volatile as ever, it seems, even more so.
I just expected Bitcoin to be on a much healthier trajectory by now.
If it doesn't happen soon... I'm really starting to think Bitcoin will always be so heavily manipulated for quick gains, that no average person would touch it... sad the way things are shaping up...
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:24:23
Thanks for your response! Yeah, generating more FUD with all the regulation talk makes sense...
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:46:10
Nice! Bitcoin moving in the right direction again! Please stay above $10k! (fingers crossed)
@_date: 2019-07-30 11:49:22
I think it’s important to remember, with all the taxing and regulation coming at Bitcoin now… didn’t Satoshi Nakamoto create Bitcoin as a response to the 2008 financial crisis? **Governments, lawmakers and corporations could care less about your financial security!** They are all out for themselves. They raided pensions and 401Ks to bail out the "too big to fail" banks. Many CEOs also received "golden parachutes". 
If Bitcoin has a chance of being an alternative to that system, **a store of value for the people**, we should all give it some time to prove its worth!
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:28:31
What about all the corrupt networks Trump is taking down right now… weren’t they all set up and funded with USD? What about corrupt politicians… weren’t they all bribed with USD? Now you catch JP Morgan trafficking $1 BILLION in drugs. All of this was facilitated with USD. Bitcoin is a brand new asset/currency. To say that Bitcoin funds illegal activity and NOT mention the US dollar in the same sentence is totally flawed logic, in my opinion. I know Trump has no choice but to endorse the Fed and the dollar for his re-election. Like him a lot, but I honestly think (and hope) he’s very wrong about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:07:14
Please stop the bleeding! Bitcoin's really getting hammered lately. With more people using and the infrastructure growing every day, shouldn't the value be slowly and steadily climbing? 
I know I sound like a broken record, but these constant backslides since June/July make no sense to me...
Who benefits from a lower and lower Bitcoin value... other than those who don't want to see it succeed?
@_date: 2019-11-23 11:05:23
That's exactly what I said yesterday. If China has dominance with the Bitcoin hash rate, then why doesn't the state (China) make deals with miners to purchase all Bitcoins at X amount below market value? They'd be stocked up with Bitcoin in no time, and would have a great interest in seeing the price skyrocket. Why hasn't China thought of this, it seems so simple? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-11-23 12:15:10
Well, if China doesn't think Bitcoin is worth investing in, doesn't that say a lot about Bitcoin? Not good...
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:48:12
What are feelings on the Fidelity news? I remember hearing back during the 2017 run up that Fidelity was setting up its own mining operations, etc. They seemed to take Bitcoin very seriously, earlier than most firms. So, I think it's very positive (fingers crossed)...
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:23:58
All good responses, thanks everyone! Just get burnt out on seeing the backslides after some positive movement. But like you said, as long as there's a pattern of "higher" lows, maybe that's a good sign...
@_date: 2019-11-10 12:21:55
Weak... so when does all this supposed halvening "mania" kick in? 
Or is it already factored in and May 2020 will be yet another non-event? Price action has been so disappointing lately...
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:40:30
Yikes! Not good... guess there's an early holiday sale on Bitcoin :(
@_date: 2019-11-08 13:47:16
Fantastic... any idea what's causing "this" drop?
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:07:42
Anyone else think it's really bad to have China controlling such a big percentage of Bitcoin mining? Renewed talk of China crackdowns, and here we sit... sub-$7k in November 2019. Every time China flinches, the price gets hammered. 
What's the point of a decentralized digital currency, if all the mining is centralized in China? They're not exactly stable these days...
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:00:25
Just curious, why are you expecting the price boom next month? Because of Bakkt? I'm not sure that's gonna move the needle the way people think... it's going to take a **lot** more than that...
@_date: 2019-08-01 23:16:09
How does "dishonest" factor into any of this? That's a weird comment...
It just seems like it should be performing better value-wise at this point, considering it reached 20k two years ago, even if it was brief.
I don't know... I just can't get excited or hopeful ***myself*** it until reclaims that ATH. Until then, it just feels like it's being undervalued and underperforming. Beyond 20k, there will be a lot of renewed excitement, don't you think? Just my ***honest*** personal perspective.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:52:48
Isn't that concentrating more and more Bitcoin in the hands of whales only? Doesn't that kill price growth and turn off new investors? just asking...
Seems like it's way too early in Bitcoin's life to keep dumping large amounts to take profits... especially if all signs point to it only going up in value...
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:11:05
Everything is relative... you're only up 300% if you bought earlier this year. What if you bought in December 2017... still down over 50%. And why is 20k this holy, unreachable valuation for Bitcoin? I hear all these things about Bitcoin "mooning" toward 100k, 1mil, while it can't even hold 10k in August 2019... that's the current *reality* fellas...
Sorry, but I am focused on price and anyone that isn't is bullshitting you. Would you all be so wrapped up in Bitcoin if the current value, after 10 years in existence, was $5 per coin? I don't think so... You can't keep spinning the price moving backwards as "a value" and "consolidation"... not with me...
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:09:47
It's not a *rally* if all the gains **disappear** in 24 hours!!!
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:27:48
So, what caused this *latest* crash?
As soon as Bitcoin starts gaining some real upward momentum, WHAM! Getting so sick of this...
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:34:23
Hopeful, but not falling for this EVER again! Every time the price climbs a few hundred dollars, people start with "moon" thing again.
Bitcoin needs to make **massive gains and sustain them** in order to have a chance of ever "mooning" for real.
Where is the flood of new money to moon going to come from, **realistically**?
It's okay to be hopeful, but be let's be ***realistic*** as well. It's going to take **decades** to "moon", if ever....
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:45:52
If Bitcoin could break out of this current price rut, that would be great : (  I don't get why 12k is such a hurdle....
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:02:39
Everyone was bitching at me last week when I said Bitcoin's value was faltering... here we are, 9k yet again. Just more healthy "consolidation", right? I want to see Bitcoin's value rise as much as anyone, but it's looking very unhealthy lately...
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:43:35
Either you can't read, you're in denial or you work for CME. So which is it?
*And* I replied to that other poster. I'm sticking to what I said: today, the CME futures is manipulation, just like the rise from $3.5 to $13k was manipulation... my point is, it's ALL some form of manipulation.
*And* you're ignoring the dozens of other posters that are citing the CME futures expiring as the cause of ***the current*** downward spiral in price...
Yet you feel it's ALL organic and you're calling me delusional... I'm done for today, think whatever you want.
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:58:19


I'm entitled to my opinion and to ask questions, cryptogrip. This is a public board where people ask questions, give opinions, etc...
You know what *I* didn't do, check *your* post history because I could care less what you think. But, you did call me TROLL so I felt compelled to respond to that...
So anyone that doesn't share *your* exact opinions and analysis of Bitcoin is a TROLL? Got it, thanks! I'll be sure to ask you what I should think before I post in the future...
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:14:40
This "retracement" is lame! C'mon Bitcoin! What about other parts of the world driving demand? China/Hong Kong conflict, Brexit, Argentina collapse, Fed printing money like there's no tomorrow... where's all the demand? I would think price would be rising steadily with all those factors? September/October performance better be SPECTACULAR...
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:58:51
Well, since it already reached 20k, my idea of a "moon" would be 100k per bitcoin. 1 million per Bitcoin would be Mars ;)
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:47:47
How is dropping from $20k down to $3k "green" movement? That's a loss of $17k in value!
I said in my post that "Bitcoin can't seem to hold any gains since it peaked at $20k."
The fact that it's trading around $10k today - August 2019, two years later - is proof of that...
Not trying to be negative, just tired of people getting all excited about small moves when it's still so far down from the ATH. How can anyone argue with that?!
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:42:51
What the heck is going on? Why is 12k such a hurdle, seems like such an arbitrary value?
If Bitcoin is destined to be so valuable, why is it struggling so hard at this stage?
I could see there being tons of resistance at 19k-20k, but 12k? C'mon!
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:42:01
That makes sense...
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:57:07
Under $8k again, this just sucks! Bitcoin's price has been steadily retreating since June, when it spiked to nearly $14k. 
What's the deal? If this downward trend is organic and not manipulation, does that mean no one is interested in Bitcoin anymore? Why else does the price keep sliding backwards? If there's more widespread use and innovation, then why is the value dropping again?
Looks like it's going to be a bumpy ride until the May 2020 halving, and I'm losing hope for any significant spike then as well... just frustrated!
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:15:47
If these constant "pumps and dumps" don't aggravate the hell out of you... then good for you, but I can't say the same!
I'd really like Bitcoin to gain HUGE value before it degrades into a "pump and dump" coin.
Like I said, it's still very early in Bitcoin's life to be doing this... it's not the same as dumping from, say, 200k down to 150k. It's never going to get off the ground at this point, reaching the heights it has the potential to.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:06:09
By organic, what I meant was real world, everyday use… Bitcoin taking hold as either a store of value or payment method. If Bitcoin was rising because of everyday use and utility, that (to me) would be healthy, positive, organic growth. Not all of this speculative trading action...
It's growth seems to come from sudden, inexplicable rises, which are inevitably followed by either sharp or drawn out retreats… like the drop from 2019’s 14k back down to 7.4k.
I’m just a regular guy, not a trader or investor. Just frustrating, because it was talked about so glowingly for the past few years, when I bought in… and it looks like it’s degraded into a pump and dump fad. You can make money, only if you have a lot of Bitcoin to play with or a lot of money to burn…. but who has that?
And the CME Chairman's comments about "taming" Bitcoin really rubbed me the wrong way. God forbid regular people can gain some financial independence. I can't imagine how fiercely Bitcoin is being attacked behind the scenes.
Just my opinions. Nice talking with you. You seem to know way more about trading and the markets than I do, that’s for sure…
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:07:44
Barely finished my reply and Bitcoin's already back under 10k again... exactly what I was talking about!
Bitcoin just can't seem to hold on to any big gains long term.
Since it hit 20k in 2017, it's been in the "red" ever since... very troubling.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:25:17
Any idea why the price is stuck in the current $8k - $8.4k range? Doesn't seem to want to move up. I would think Bakkt's poor debut would be wearing off and the price would continue its upward movement, no?
Not looking so hot, especially if it's supposed to be heading toward $16k in October...
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:25:58
Couldn't central banks buy (or mine) Bitcoin anonymously at this stage... before they make a public announcement? It could be a sly way to keep the price down while they accumulate...
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:00:28
So, does this mean that in May 2020, Bitcoin won't be much higher than $7,620...?
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:19:48
Ugh... under 10k yet again! Something had better energize the Bitcoin space soon. This is not feeling good lately... never thought the price would flatline then reverse like it's doing, someone please stop the bleeding!
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:43:32
Deluded, huh? Here's what CME's chairman said about Bitcoin back in 2017  
 [
Now look at this [ 
Still think I'm deluded?
@_date: 2019-08-22 03:58:48
So, let me get this straight... you all think Bitcoin's price dropping below 10k numerous times after weeks and weeks of stagnation is a reason to be pumped? Like, that's a positive thing?
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:08:30
What I'm afraid of, is that Institutions are buying up Bitcoin just to take it out of circulation. They are not "investing" in it for the future, they are eliminating their competition by buying it up.
And by Holding, it's not integrating Bitcoin into people's lives and everyday use. Kind of a bleak scenario, but very believable. Institutions and Governments need to keep you poor, and they have limitless funds to do so...
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:58:17
Really, you think so? I would think most people 35 and older barely know what bitcoin is, much less own any. I don't think it's gotten even close to mainstream adoption yet. Right now, it's more of a speculative asset that investors are playing with. I'd be surprised if saturation were the reason that the price keeps plateauing this early on... I think it's being manipulated/suppressed lower, but not sure exactly why...
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:45:58
Good points and good perspective. Thanks for your response!
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:05:31
Just curious, what is going to spark a huge surge in value anytime soon? Bakkt? China trade war? Where's all the institutional investment that was supposed to drive the price into the stratosphere?
Price has been faltering since 13k. I know, I know, it's way up from January of this year. But there seems to be no "heat" on bitcoin lately... no buzz, no excitement... worrying...
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:10:17
Seriously, how many times can Bitcoin crash in one month? This is going to set some kind of record...
@_date: 2019-10-12 19:18:35
But, Bitcoin only had a fraction of the exposure at the $200-$1000 level that it does today – in October 2019! Those prices were very impressive back then.
I'm just saying it seems pretty "blah" lately, after sliding steadily backwards for two years from $20k. 
Just hate seeing it stagnate at such a relatively low price point... makes me start doubting a serious rebound toward and past $20k.
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:31:44
Apparently there's a huge Labor Day sale on Bitcoin! Just when you think it can't go any lower... BAM! What the actual fuck? 
I said it weeks ago... Bitcoin lost a tremendous amount of momentum in August... just a horrible month performance-wise. You all downvoted me, but I was absolutely right.
Hope things get better in September, but Bitcoin is looking so weak right now. I can't see where a new big September pump is going to come from. Where is new money going to come from? Gold and silver are pumping, the stock market is chugging along and Bitcoin is sinking! None of this makes sense to me anymore...
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:47:23
Stalled... again...
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:23:29
Excellent video about how Bitcoin is being attacked by U.S. Government and Institutions together, as a store of value. Confirms a lot of what I feared: CME, CBOE, and BAKKT were never intended to help Bitcoin.
Takeaway is that we'd better start using Bitcoin for everyday transactions, or it's doomed to fail.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:08:56
Can selling 25k bitcoins really drop the price $1k in 24 hours? What if the coins sold were bought up by other people right away? Doesn't the whale take a risk that the same amount of coins won't be available to buy back? Sorry if these are basic or stupid questions, just trying to understand more...
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:11:22
Take a look at this [
If you're not concerned about this type of blatant manipulation, you need to think. Bitcoin has never looked more bleak than it does right now, October 2019. No reason at all to be positive...
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:40:43
Absolutely! How is this not another fake pump, that will be followed by a sudden crash?
You really think people, institutions, and banks are suddenly genuinely jumping on board since yesterday?
As I said in my previous post: "my point is, it's ALL some form of manipulation."
You're being set up for another massive dump within weeks or months, tops.
NONE of this is organic, up or down.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:46:34
Nice! Just like the good old days, with $1k gains per day. Please keep it going! :)
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:56:46
Yeah, Bitcoin is looking pretty grim for the rest of 2019, really wish it wasn't...
I hope May 2020 halving mania kicks in, because I think Bitcoin really needs some positive press and positive headlines before the general public ever looks at it again.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:40:31
I'm getting so tired of having a reason to post "WTF Bitcoin" every week lately.... seriously Bitcoin? WTF is going on, anyone know?
Futures contracts are seriously going to destroy Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:45:29
Gotta admit, after this latest crash, (how is a 24 hour 3.7k loss not a crash?) I'm thinking the path to Bitcoin being utilized by everyday people and maintaining any consistent value is going to take YEARS longer than anyone thinks, if it ever happens. The only people that can survive 3.7k a day dips are either Bitcoin whales or the very wealthy. This kind of movement scares off and wrecks everyday user and small investor confidence.
I know it can't just go up and up, but these big crashes are TERRIBLE for adoption and make Bitcoin really look like a reckless investment. Coinbase being so unstable is TERRIBLE too. Is this going to happen every time volume spikes? Awful for adoption and trading! Just my opinions...
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:19:52


Totally agree with this. I can't believe Tether exists, it's such a horribly bad idea. I hope it goes away sooner than later. I really wish it was not possible to purchase bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:05:53
EXACTLY! I thought the exchanges would be better prepared this time around too. Seems like the same old story, unfortunately. Really bad for widespread adoption and usage.
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:44:08
Just wishful thinking... I guess :)
If not 16k, would at least like to see it gain positive momentum again...
@_date: 2019-12-01 12:18:41
What a lame holiday "bump"... starting to think we will NEVER see 20k Bitcoin in our lifetime again. Bitcoin has been officially "tamed". 
It's just a manipulated mess for the foreseeable future. Happy Holidays everyone!
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:24:47
True... so this means that none of Bitcoin's up or down movements are organic any more... it's ALL just manipulation.
This just sucks so much! Maybe I didn't realize fully until today...
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:07:58
I realize it's a long haul to change the way people perceive money. So many liken Bitcoin to the internet/email in 1995/1996. By 2005/2006, mass adoption had happened. I know, I know... it's apples and oranges and people are very resistant to changes with their money, so it may take 30, 40, 50 years (who knows?) for the same widespread adoption... IF it ever happens at all.
I don't know... I just thought we'd be further along with adoption and especially value by 2020... especially since it spiked so high in 2017. It is looking like a very, very, very slow process and long haul... just disheartening at times. Feels like I won't live long enough to see Bitcoin's payoff. You also have to agree that it's likely being slow tracked and attacked behind the scenes by governments and banking institutions, which isn't helping things...
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:39:43
Ugh... Bitcoin's been stuck in the $8k range for far too long.
Is there just a general lack of interest from the public and investors? Action kinda sucks lately...
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:19:27
"Game" being the operative word. You really think Bitcoin isn't being both manipulated and having its growth stifled? 
Only early adopters got lucky, the rest of us will not be so fortunate... sucks, but that's the reality.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:38:08
Exactly. Any pumps lately are small and short-lived... or the product of flat out manipulation. 
There's no positive organic growth going on with Bitcoin right now, or any time soon... get used to it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:06:47
I know 2017 was a fluke, but one could also say that $7k Bitcoin is down 65% from that ATH of $20k.
I just don't think that $7k Bitcoin is going to set the world on fire, and revolutionize the world's monetary system.
Bitcoin has to have some HUGE, sustainable growth at some point, before it captures the world's attention again, if ever. I honestly feel that's the truth...
@_date: 2019-12-14 17:26:26
Ugh... dropping again, what gives?! Remember $1k gains per day? Will we ever see those again? Bitcoin is just looking so miserably weak lately... sucks...
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:18:05
WEAK! C'mon Bitcoin, you're better than this!
@_date: 2019-12-14 23:37:25
"But BTC really isnt doing so well."
I said the same exact thing, and get furiously downvoted for it.
Bitcoin is doing miserable lately and all anyone posts here is "Great, I'll just buy more!". What's the point if it keeps losing all of its gains? You'd have to buy so much Bitcoin to make any profit, like who has $70k lying around to buy 10 bitcoins, so they can make only a tiny profit?
Since July 2019 (when it tanked from $14k), Bitcoin's been making minimal gains only to give it all back the next day or week. I see absolutely no strength behind Bitcoin's price, and none on the horizon. It's wasting away and no one seems to be bothered by it. Bizarre...

Don't worry everyone, as soon as the markets get back to work, they'll crash Bitcoin *hard* to make up for the minimal gains this past week... you can bet on it!

I don't know why, but I recently had that exact same thought... the wealthy use "art purchases" to move around large sums of money. Who can argue about what art is supposedly worth to someone? Great way to launder money.
Rumor is all these celebrity politician "book deals" for millions are the same thing... the book publishers are used as a front for an unknown party to pay for a favor from the politician. Shady world we live in...

Thanks for the replies, guys! Always helpful to get different perspectives.

I agree, Tether has to be addressed, seems like disaster waiting to happen. The idea of a virtual currency pegged to the dollar, with no cap, should scare anyone away.
How would Tether's collapse effect Bitcoin? Asking because I'm not sure...

Stagnant with multiple, sudden dips since August... what the heck is going on?
Bakkt seems to be a non-factor. What will move the price up anytime soon?

$400 drop in minutes.... nice!

So, is the popular opinion that the Bitcoin price was just manipulated down to cover futures contracts in the $7500-$8000 range?
If so, that's pretty disturbing... that means it can happen over and over again... not good.

Once quantum computers are mainstream, couldn't you just "nest" the entire blockchain behind quantum resistant passwords?
What I'm saying is, if they start using quantum computers to crack passwords, then won't they start using those same computers to generate passwords that are essentially "unhackable"... like fighting fire with fire?

That's what I keep wondering... why is all the Bitcoin news, regulation, and adoption so driven by the USA?
Don't other parts of the world stand to gain so much from moving away from the dollar? I would think the USA is the least pro-Bitcoin nation on the planet because they manipulate everything and everyone through the dollar...

Max was predicting Bitcoin crossing $15k in mid August... and it immediately slumped to $9,200:
I Tweeted to him that he should stop making baseless Bitcoin price predictions, as it hurts his credibility... if he still has any. He immediately blocked me... that's Max Keiser in a nutshell. Guy knows nothing more than you or me about Bitcoin.

Excellent article about the recent injection of Fed cash into the Repo market... really underscores the need for Bitcoin. This excerpt was an eye opener:
*For every US Treasury security outstanding, roughly*[ *three parties*]( *believe they own it. That’s right. Multiple parties report that they own the very same asset, when only one of them truly does.*

Turning into a bloodbath... $8.6k and falling... thanks Bakkt! :(

If the Fed printing $53 billion out of thin air overnight doesn't underscore the need for Bitcoin, I don't know what will.
Bitcoin's value should be screaming past $100k right now. The fact that it is only $10k makes no sense to me. My guess is Bitcoin's price/value is being heavily suppressed by multiple institutions (The Fed, Central Banks, Wall Street, Governments). They need to keep the "average Joe" working for scraps and taxed to death.

Seems so fishy... there has been months of talk about how alt coins are on their deathbed (isn't Bitcoin close to 90% dominance?), then alts suddenly start pumping again?
I have zero interest in alts until Bitcoin reaches a new ATH... hopefully soon...

One thing I noticed about Bitcoin, it fluctuates so rapidly that right now, all of the featured articles on Google's home page are wrong and outdated (Bitcoin Price Dips to $9.6K as Bear Cross Looms).
Gotta keep up Google, it's back over $10k already!

Anyone else think that the US and central banks might be happy if this "Craig Wright is legally Satoshi" nonsense disrupts the progress of Bitcoin? Almost like muddying the waters and allowing confusion is the whole intent?
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:15:20
Very well put! 
It does seem very strange that we're waiting for approval and acceptance from the same system that we're trying to break away from.
Once Bitcoin rises to a certain value, they'll be racing to approve.

Just watched the CBS piece... did I miss something or was it just terrible? The two best people to represent Bitcoin were a felon and the guy who paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas? Really CBS? No talk of Bitcoin’s unique qualities or possibilities. What a garbage piece, in my opinion…
