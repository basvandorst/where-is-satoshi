"Only the keys" heh. 
Yup thanks will do. Haven't really been keeping up with developments on the software side.

Cool. Thank you I was pretty out of the loop on what the latest bitcoin apps were. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:02:08
I guess? I haven't really paid attention to developments in the apps and such over the last few years.

Wat. How would that be?

Actually most of it is binding. Some of it can be disputed, that is true, but if 99.9% was not binding then almost no-one would care. 
Compulsory arbitration clauses are very much enforceable especially in the UK and the US.

Let's not forget these.

IAAL. 
What you've described is called consideration. And using someone's services, like paypal, constitutes consideration.

You can put an awful lot into a contract. Even consideration need not be reasonable. Courts have held that literally chocolate bar wrappers can be consideration if exchanged for something else of value. 
But some rights cannot be waived (in some places) but those are pitifully few.

Fine, in which case OP's article is not even high-school level philosophy.

Great comment

The European Union and the European currency are two separate things. 
There's plenty of European entities, and the Euro, the EEC, the ECHR and plenty of others. Easy to confuse.
