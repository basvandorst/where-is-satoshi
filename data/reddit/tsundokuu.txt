A hodler never cares. I can't even fathom caring.
But in all seriousness if you're not using bitcoin as a medium of exchange (which is what will make it more valuable), and if you are using it solely as a means of investment, you really shouldn't put more in than you could afford to lose. The anxiety goes away when you don't put your life on the line.

Well said, I'm still gonna hodl but I'm sobering up to the fact that hodling won't make me rich 10 years down the line.

This is exactly what keeps me at ease when I passed on investing years ago. Even if I had invested, chances are so incredibly high I would have sold the moment the price tripled, I certainly wouldn't have held on till now. No fucking way

i probably am, but it's a question that's so fucked. "what was the first name of your first manager?" well, i've had maybe 7-9 different jobs since I was 16, a lot of them i had more than 2 managers, so how the f*ck am i supposed to know? sorry lol. just, ugh! haha.
also they don't even specify if the answer needs to be case sensitive...

I know, I understand, they just all seem so different and I was wondering if there was a general recommendation for wallets in this subreddit.

thanks for this information, I'm so stressed out right now (not just concerning this) so I haven't really been doing the proper research. shame on me. btw in your opinion is there any wallet you would recommend?
