Now let's get out there and give em the business like we mean it! I'm so jazzed up right now I can't even play in a major scale anymore.

But what about what Amazon did to the post office/mailing services?

Well maybe this is me being naive, but assuming bitcoin never gets hacked or has technical limitations, if everybody says it's safe to invest in, wouldn't that mean it's safe to invest in, in theory. Because bitcoin only works if everybody believes in it? Like the more that people use it, which is basically belief, the better it becomes?

Keeping half is better than nothing, it's still definitely not a loss if you weren't even expecting to get I back.

Does anyone know what kind of impact 300k or whatever arbitrary investment has on bitcoin as a whole. I know there's more factors but I would assume, the more pepper buy, the rare it becomes and the more me have to "split" bitcoin in order to make bitcoin available to anyone, at increased prices. I just didn't know if you could know something like "someone is investing 10 million dollars, it will cause bitcoin to be X more" scarce" and X more expensive"

That's literally the attitude anyone should have about anything in life

Ya that's almost 5 grand you didn't have before assuming you sell now, which you shouldn't ha. You already waited a few years, you can wait a bit more others you'll go through the regret all over again. Plus if I were you and I lost all of it because bitcoin tanked, whatever, I wrote off that bitcoin anyway and 5 grand isn't THAT much but that could turn into something very substantial, especially considering that's money that basically came out of nowhere, ride that train to the moon my man!

Yes, I was just pointing out that bitcoin has a ton of room to grow. $10 will always be $10 but the more bitcoin grows, the more we'll have to divide it. Just because we had rapid growth lately, doesn't mean it's topped out.

I remember seeing up mining software on my computer and attempted to try and join a pool like 5 years ago, right after I got my new computer. I got the software set up but Ilafter trying to figure everything out I was like "what the fuck am I really gonna do with this bitcoin"... If I woulda just went through with it and tried mining for a couple weeks or months... I'd probably be able to buy the house I've always wanted... It just sickens me because I remember doing similar stuff like folding @ home protein software to just "be nice" and yet, I didn't do a similar thing for bitcoin... I didn't really get back into it until the price was hovering around 400 bucks, I just feel so dumb for actually being there around the time it was really all starting up and I just didn't really know what I was looking at.

How much is in there?

@_date: 2017-05-22 06:52:37
For bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:53:21
How you could tell if he smelled bad? You're like 40 feet away

I don't think it's too late. mBTC will just become the new BTC etc
