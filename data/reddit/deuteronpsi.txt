My 4hr charts show right here in the mid $14s to be a resistence level and the 1day chart shows not much support until mid 9s. That said, it's just educated guess work TBH

Does your computer at home have the capability of storing hundreds of thousands of 1TB blocks? Do you want to centralize BTC? Because this is how you centralize BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:46
$18640 for Mar18 contracts would mean that the buyers are betting on the price of BTC being higher than that come March while the sellers are betting the price will be lower.
It's a sideline bet that is not directly tied to the BTC market.

Good idea. I'll give that a go for the alts I know I used in the past. This particular dat file did come from a folder specifically labeled as BTC so fingers crossed. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:35:52
So like large companies with data centers? Again, that’s how you centralize Bitcoin which is against one of its core principals. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:07:10
Futures trading does not involve Bitcoin, at all. It isn't actually trading BTC. It's all cash settled side bets. What the futures do could influence price when people actually trading BTC buy/sell based on what they see the futures doing but the futures trading itself doesn't touch BTC in any way.

I see many people complaining of these long transaction times. I've been moving mine around and spending here and there and haven't had to wait more than an hour at worst. Most are on the chain with a minute or two and confirmed in 10-15. We do need to get back to the early days of transaction speeds though. Fingers crossed that Lightning Network can do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:09:45
Ideal target price for sellers is $0. $18640 is just a seller betting that the price won't increase above that by March '18. That's it. If you as a buyer think that's too low, you'd buy that contract and hope to profit in the next few months. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:41:07
With fewer on chain transactions fees will drop to much lower levels than they are now.

Perfectly normal when dealing with fiat banks. What I do is transfer a bit to my GDAX USD account then use that to buy when I'm ready. Then I transfer again immediately so in another few days I have more USD at my disposal for another purchase.

You're really young which means you have decades to watch BTC grow in your favor. BTC is still a child. It's teenage years are going to be explosive. Buy a little here and there while enjoying life, hold it all in cold storage until you retire early. I'd give anything to be young again and have decades of BTC (not to mention life) ahead of me.

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:37:25
That's normal if you purchased via ACH transfer from a bank account. You were locked in to your price at the time of purchase but you won't get the coins until the bank transfer clears in 3-5 business days.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:41:00
I see that it places market orders. Just food for thought, add an option so that it'll place limit orders instead with a variable of how much % or $ below current market price. If it doesn't fill within x minutes cancel it and resubmit the order at an updated price target. I hope that makes sense. It does in my head. LOL 
This way the orders get the maker fee which is currently 0%.

I feel as though LN is like writing a check, kind of. The check itself means nothing and the money in the bank doesn’t move until the giver hands over the check and the receiver agrees to close the transaction by depositing it (closing the channel).
Someone feel free to correct this analogy. Still learning about LN over here.

Where does it stop? 10MB? 100MB? 100TB? Eventually block sizes would become too large for your average person with a PC at home to run a node. The larger the block size gets the more centralized BTC becomes. It sounds like an easy solution, and it is, but it's far from the correct solution. The flagship feature of BTC is decentralization. If it starts to lose that what's the point any longer?

Not to mention that by trading on his own exchange his partners are able to see his trades and have disclosure.  If he uses whatever knowledge he does have and trades on other exchanges then that's shady.

Precisely. It's like buying that bag of chips at a convenience store versus a grocery store. It's the same product but one was a little more convenient (and more expensive) to get than the other. Coinbase is also dealing with a ton of US regulations in order to make the process seem easy when it really isn't behind the scenes.

@_date: 2017-11-23 09:29:21
I concur. If you want to avoid Coinbase fees, transfer the USD to GDAX (free) and then place a buy limit order below the current market price. That makes you a "maker" which means you pay a zero fee.
