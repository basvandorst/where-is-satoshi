You're all fucking dumb and when the bubble pops I'm going to have a great time laughing about it. Literally counting your chickens before they hatch.

Speculation used to be punishable by death. Still is in Russia. This kind of hype benefits no one except the person spinning the hype. Crypto has been pretty toxic for awhile, ever since the first Bitcoin got a USD value in fact. Since then the people in it to make a buck any way they can, including posts like this that subtly promote buying more coin right now before the value spikes, far out number the people that got into it as a decentralized form of alternative currency. OP isn't putting in his "two cents" because there is nothing rational about what he is saying. This is rhetoric intended to create a response, hopefully getting some naive people new to the system to buy buy buy, driving up the value so OP can dump his coin for a big payout before the bubble bursts. Do yourself a favor and just don't get involved

Speculation, in Italy, specifically Venice (no surprise) was considered so dangerous that merchants openly engaged in it could be punished or even executed. You did NOT fuck with their money.
Anecdotally in Russia there are 13 "economic crimes", one of which is speculation, considered so damaging to local and national economic safety that they carry the death penalty. Look it up, no lie.
OP, here in this post, is engaged in a form of speculation. Hence my comments.
