I hear you on certain vested interests and the costs that we don't see, but my focus is on the pocketbook on consumers.  Germany is a poor example  cents per kwh -   I wish they hadn't been so foolish to shut down their nuclear power, but that they did and it forced them to get more dirty energy from coal.
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:29:14
So you’re saying we can clean that stuff outta the atmosphere?
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:31:06
Again, we just want cheapest energy. Give it to us, science!!  :)
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:39:43
Seriously.  Who think weee pathetic humans can have a significant impact on either warming or cooling the planet.  The planet gon do what it gon do.  Ps carbon is the essence of life.  
It’s all about money.  Hose the common people on electricity prices while fat cats make big money on their carb cap and trade schemes.  
I’m out. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:43:23
Politics will bankrupt a people without providing a new clean energy source.   [  And after all the BILLIONS obama pumped into clean energy loans, no innovation emerged that would spare us the heavy price.  It's like they don't want it to be cheap or clean, they just  want to milk the consumer through higher prices / taxes.....
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:13:20
Again, it’s reality.  High electricity prices for consumers.  We agree politics sucks and hopefully science gives us some good prototypes.  Until then, inaction is better than the action proposed by the political climate movement.

Dont get your panties in a twist. Stieglitz can both be intelligent and also a shill.  Those who cant tell the difference between his shilling and economic genius are economically illiterate.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 04:14:15
I’m curious to know why the gods of science demand a pound of flesh instead of giving us low cost clean energy.  The implications of higher cost energy are anti humanitarian.  Surely the gods are both smart and compassionate to give us the better solution...

Restricting Bangladeshis from using coal prevents the escape from poverty.  Cheap energy is the number one factor in reduced poverty.  
@_date: 2018-09-25 00:01:20
That escalated quickly.   Jk.  I’m sure we could have some pretty excellent whiskey philosophy conversation on those higher planes.  I agree that globalization seems like a race to the bottom - check out yes men ok remote labor  acceptable risk is also awesome   At a basic level I think the average and reasonable maga view is that lower the tax / cost of living, the better off I am.  The more complicated equation create too many degrees of assumption.  That’s why a reliable sub $.05 kWh energy source will distinguish itself and steal biz from traditional sources by its superior value and not through political mandates. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:13:04
Yeah so.  We can skip the whole money grab Paris deal and wait for these brilliant people to give cheap clean sources in next few years hopefully.  That would save us the pound of flesh many want us to sacrifice.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 20:22:37
How does action to levy carbon taxes not hurt the middle and lower classes?  28 cents per kwh in Germany is very real and it hurts the poorest people the most.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:31:38
I have no doubt that the price will be paid by my children if a crazy wealth redistribution and carbon tax scheme is put into place.  That would be inhumanely destructive of future economic growth.  In fact, it's downright lazy.
If these brilliant scientists have the tech to deliver cheaper, cleaner power then bring it on!!!  But no rational person signs up to some kumbaya about futile efforts to save the planet through crippling energy taxation.

The reality is BTC is obsolete.  POW incentivized economies of scale and has led to centralization of mining.  CZ discussed having miners roll back transactions.  Not sure these patches will do anything but further erode integrity of the principle.  There are better on chain solutions like nano that are instant, feeless, and not susceptible to the downfalls of POW centralization.
