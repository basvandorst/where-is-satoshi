Thank you.
I wasn't aware.

I have friends that hold all of their savings in the banks and now with the capital controls they withdraw only 60€ / day.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:27:48
Is there any graph for these metrics? That would be very interesting as well.
EDIT: Found this: (
If you look deep inside it actually demonstrates the gradual minimization of interest rates of the central banks. If he actually stated that, I think Andreas is exaggerating a bit. Nevertheless, I'm sure he knows very good what he is doing and f**k central banking, their money and their policies.

Have some extras!
What an awesome evening!

Member of the Greek bitcoin community here.
There is deep uncertainty here, but we are giving people the alternative.
We are trying to build a community that could receive and give bitcoins to the Greek market. We are worried for our food, our pensioners, and of course we believe that this fear and distrust for the central authorities is not going to stop, on a global scale.
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:22:49
Yep! That's absolutely right.
The donations will facilitate us to create the first representative body of digital currencies in Greece.
The main goal is to be a decentralized autonomous organisation. We have a lot of work to do.
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:40:54
We handed out 600 flyers in the rioting people outside the parliament of Greece. The flyers were saying:
It is time for plan B
The independent international currency
-Works without banks, you are the bank.
-It is a decentralized digital currency. No middlemen.
-Not governed by any institution, not subject to any restrictions or haircuts.
-Send and receive everywhere in the world, instantly and completely safely.
You can inform in here meetup.com/AthensBTM/

or a better integration for iPad!

We mainly did our presentations in English. We announced the launch of The Greek Bitcoin and Blockchain Association also. Further developments are on their way. 
Also, there was a presentation of [spartanroute.com]( and some technical presentations from the people who teach at the University of Nicosia in the MSc for bitcoin.
Pretty good meetup! We are here to grow the Bitcoin ecosystem. Now is the chance.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:45:40
We cannot get into details right now, but it will be the first entity in Greece.
We certainly need one. A community to help people with expertise to arrive in Athens and Greece to innovate and solve the big problems that our businessmen have and transact with bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:19:59
If not, whose fault is it?
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:00:55
What matters most now for the bitcoin ecosystem is the fact that it is on a neutral ground. No economic inefficiencies can suspend bitcoin.
It is at the center and rapidly expanding. Hope that the expansion will pump the unfair economic relations out of our society. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:53:07
This is our financial sheet: 
This is our blockchain wallet: 
And we are taking more and more actions with our community.
@_date: 2015-07-16 10:07:39
We are gathering donations for further actions like the flyers in the Athens ground.
EDIT: I had a second thought in the word official. I erased it. Sorry :)
We need ways to atrract specialised people to build new forms of societal organizations. I do believe that the hierarchies should be in a cyclical rotation and decentralized. It is difficult to implement, I know, but not impossible. Greece is a very interesting place for bitcoin right now.

Thank you my friend
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:41:07
I used a feature in picasa called retouch that you can rearrange pixels in the photo.
Do you think it's OK?
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:23:15
haha. It's a lot obscured. 
I don't think you could get them.
EDIT: and the importance of this story is to spread the word, rather than the 2 dollars
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:30:04
We have to spread the word my friend. Just take, for example, the refugee crisis in Europe. All those poor people, stuck in some hostile borders and fences have a cheap smartphone in their hands, but they don't know that they could use it to get resources.
We have to do more. All this interconnectivity of people could raise our species in a whole new level. We just have to use our technology the right way. 
Others call it homo universalis. All the people to act as one. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:44:33
Hello dear friend.
It's a very complex topic, about the way we are governed. 
All I am trying to do is to spread the idea of human oriented economy. 
We could describe this as a symbolic and allegoric move. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:03:15
This is the article I wrote for the blog we have in the greek community.
@_date: 2015-09-20 22:42:43
Hello friend.
Well, I believe that there is a spiritual change that our world needs and cannot be achieved when we worship our leaders. Bitcoin has the ability to inspire the solidarity that will alter our moral values and build a society based on truth.
The truth that our society and our candidates mostly understand, is the monetary truth. 
The consciousness and peaceful revolution, as I call it, will only spread from the bottom to up. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:18:14
Hey my friend.
The translation is at the bottom of the imgur album.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:07:21
Yes, it just counts as invalid.
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:00:31
Hello dear friends and thank you for being part of this action.
I am a bit dissapointed though, because all of the comments I wrote have downvoted. 
I would kindly like to remind, you and the admins, that reddit community uses downvotes to exclude irrelevant and non-contributive to the discussion content. (see reddiquete)
Do you believe that that content wasn't a contribution?
Although, I am really happy that a lot of people questioned this bitcoin voting, because a questioned man is a wise man.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:09:35
Hello dear friend. Thank you for your question.
The radical coalition of lefts, known as SYRIZA is once more the winners with the emphatic 37%.
The second party is the right wing "new democracy" with 28%.
Third is the neo-nazi party "golden dawn".
The abstention of the elections has touched the huge 48%.
Both big parties at the moment follow the policy of memorandum that Troika has imposed to the Greek government. Before two months SYRIZA drove the country to a referendum on whether the ultimatum of negotiations of EU and Greek government would be accepted. The "NO" vote triumphed with 62%. Right after the referendum capital controls in the banks imposed, which still count, and SYRIZA changed entirely their policy by signing the memorandum.
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:56:15
OK. That's it. I'm calling a demonstration outside of the HQ.
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:20:24
haha. 
did you think that i said nice work to the mod?
@_date: 2015-03-26 08:22:57
one guy for one billion.
doesn't seem fair.
isn't it?
@_date: 2015-10-19 07:51:48
I know that.
We are just discussing.
Being bad isn't really needed.
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:51:48
No man, with the network effect the bitcoin has achieved, it is censorship resistant.
Only if we were in the early stages, someone could harm bitcoin.
For example,Jullian Assange [declared]( nakamoto's worries about linking bitcoin to wikileaks.
Furthermore, no banking system or government can apply to all bitcoin users KYC.

It just doesn't make sense why he hasn't even thrown a little mention.
I've been following him since the beginning of his peaceful/openness/connect the world with technology and Computer Science mission and bitcoin has the potential to fit into these dynamics.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:14:31
Yes, that's correct.
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:31:05
The combination of bitcoin, social networks and the internet in general is a new scheme that has never existed before.
Economic crises are and will be beneficial for bitcoin. The adoption of this technology however has the potential to transcend and make obsolete previous situations.
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:10:03
It is the oldest profession that despite all the disruptive technologies still thrive.
No problem by me (for now).
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:05:18
Thats a good point

Actually, Sarutobi gave me my first bitcoins.
I really think that Apple sucks and they certainly think different...than bitcoin!

Greetings from Greece.
Actually I've never tried changetip before that's why I post to this thread.
Take care!
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:35:57
Yes, but Facebook cannot achieve the computational power the Bitcoin network has...
@_date: 2015-10-11 02:58:02
two are the fundamental attributes of bitcoin that cannot be restricted:
Money without government
Censorship resistant
Anyone who doesn't understand that is doomed to fail.
Nice work buddy!
