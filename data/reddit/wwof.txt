ı actually want to ask . some people create this bitcoin. i think there is a link between bitcoin and people who created this magazine  frontpage . 
so i want to learn these people who planned 30 years ago this bitcoin. what they want to make this money value .. we can call new word orders boss. what is their plan ? surely we cannot understand but 1 btc is 10k dollar is good for these people or 100 k dollar is good for these people. and why they created this money. i think they created because they want to convert all the moneys in the world to one type.  so they are pump up bitcoin. and pump and pump. when the value will come the point which they want. it will stop. if we can understand these main thing. we can make true guess about btc value in 2018 or 2019.
i have very bad english. i hope you can understand me little bit :=).
