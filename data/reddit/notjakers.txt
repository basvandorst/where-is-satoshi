Even more so, what is priced in Bitcoin? Merchants that accept it nearly universally price in some fiat currency and convert the price to bitcoin. And the Bitcoin is almost immediately converted into the same fiat. 
When salaries are specified in Bitcoin, when prices are set in Bitcoin, when merchants hold on their Bitcoin to make further transactions with their suppliers, then Bitcoin will have demonstrated its a real currency. And then it will have some tangible store of value. Until then, it's pure speculation. "Store of value" is a fairy tale crypto-anarchists tell themselves at night to deceive themselves. Real stores of value have a stable, well, value. No one buys $10k of Bitcoin because they want to keep their money safe. It's purely speculative. And valuations based nearly entirely on speculation wholly unstable. 
Let's see which of us hits triple digit negative karma first.

There's no hope. If the financial statements are accurate, they simply don't have any money or Bitcoin. Maybe ten cents of assets for every dollar in the reserves, but my guess is that money will be seized by governments before a single user sees a single penny.
There is no way anyone will do any business with Mt. Gox or any successor entity again. None, zero, zilch. At best someone will buy the domain &amp; trading platform, and let the assets rot.
If you're offered more than a 1/10 what your account was worth, you should snap it up in a heartbeat. Unless there was no theft, there is simply a 0% chance that you'll get all your BTC back.

And in fairness, he did butcher your name. But like it or not, the quote is 100% accurate. And he is under no legal, ethical or journalistic obligation to convey the underlying message of your interview. Many of us-- including myself-- have given long interviews to journalists only to see a few quotes (not of our choosing) used in the eventual article. Once you make the realization that that's the ordinary course of events, you start to think that folks believing journalists have some sort of ethical obligation to recreate the spirit of an interview rather than merely use selective quotes to fill out an article are a bit naive.

Could not see that one coming. You come across as surprisingly naive. After writing an extended screed attacking a writer for accurately quoting, you can't really be surprised that the readers would act in such a childish fashion.
The only wrong Michael Casey did was misspelling your name. Besides that? He's a reporter, not your publicist. The whole open letter reeked of someone with a sense of vast entitlement. This letter simply rounds out the image of someone holier-than-thou. Really the perfect coda.

Is this a popular solution? There's absolutely no guarantee of security, and the incentive structure is set up to protect Flexcoin ahead of depositers. That's an unsustainable way to operate a bank (or wallet) in the long run. Favorite bits from their terms:
The "if we fuck up you're screwed" term:
*However, Flexcoin Inc is not responsible for insuring any bitcoins stored in the Flexcoin system. You are entering into this agreement with Flexcoin Inc. You agree to not hold Flexcoin Inc, or Flexcoin Inc's stakeholders, or Flexcoin Inc's shareholders liable for any lost bitcoins.*
And 
The "you're bitcoins never expire until 18 months are up" term:
*Flexcoin Inc reserves the right to close accounts that have had no activity for a period of 1.5 years (18 months). If an account has had no transactions associated with it over the course of 18 months, it will be considered dormant. Flexcoin Inc reserves the right to collect the bitcoins in any such account and label them as fees, which will in turn make the above section on discount payments applicable to any such bitcoins*
Do people read these terms before putting thousands of dollars in what is effectively a bank? Mind boggling.

Stocks pay dividends. Bonds collect interest. Fiat currency in the bank is a remarkably stable way to store wealth for a few years, losing about 2% in value annually. 
Bitcoin pays no dividends. Collects no interest. And is not at all unstable. The insistence of Bitcoin fandom to conflate everything into a "bet" is the root of the evangelism around it. Understand the difference. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 23:22:20
It's like eBay, where the sellers were openly selling illegal products and eBay took active measures to enable the illegal activity to continue. And if eBay instructed sellers how to package their illegal products to avoid detection. And where eBay held all the sales in escrow, effectively serving not only as a marketplace but as a financial middleman for drug dealers and many others. 
Just like eBay.

There was just a Planet Money episode about Bitcoin. Back in 2014, one of the Coin Base investors bet that at least 10% of Americans would use Bitcoin *to buy something* once/month by 2019. The bet: a pair of Alpaca socks. 
Ipsos did a survey, and found that 3% claimed they had bought something with Bitcoin in the past month. When asked where they used Bitcoin, most answers were either Crypto exchanges or via retailers that don't take Bitcoin. So maybe 1% of Americans use Bitcoin once/month for purchases. 
So the Coin Base guy lost a pair of Alpaca socks, but made tens of millions in appreciation. He's probably not too beat up about it. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:30:20
Still not clear to me why any of this would happen. Are there any available figures on the volume of sales priced in Bitcoin? 
Or even, the amount of retail sales where the seller does not soon convert to the despised Fiat currency. 
If retailers, in some meaningful quantity, start holding Bitcoin in order to pay their vendors without ever exchanging for Fiat currency, that would be the first sign that maybe Bitcoin could be a legitimate currency. Right now, it's a speculative tool (90%) and a way for a tiny segment of the population to pay for items priced in stable fiat currencies.

Bravo! Bitcoin is not an investment, it's a currency (in theory). Holding Bitcoin to make money is simply speculation. Owning shares in Apple or Verizon, you are making money (some of which is returned as dividends). 
Want to invest? Buy stocks.
Want to loan money? Buy bonds?
Want to maintain a fairly steady value over a few years? Leave it in greenbacks.
Want to bet that one currency will appreciate faster than others? Buy Bitcoin.

This is such unadulterated nonsense. And it's all downhill from there. There is no stability. It's not backed by anything and there is no intrinsic value. It's difficult to transfer.

It’s a token with no intrinsic value. It’s not used as a currency for any serious purpose. Almost nothing is priced in bitcoin. Almost no transactions are conducted directly in bitcoin between buyer and seller. It currently serves virtually no purpose besides serving as a “store of value” which is rich for a commodity/ currency/ token that has proven to be more volatile than anything else used as a store of value. 
If Bitcoin ever hits $19k again you can mock me all you want. Until then, I can just laugh at the Internet jockeys baselessly proclaiming that the value of this virtual token will increase 20-fold in more due to the scarcity of a token that has no use. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:23
Exactly. Bitcoin has no real future if it's only treated as a commodity. It's a curiosity. When it's used as real currency-- when goods are priced-- not just paid-- in Bitcoins, that will be an indicator that Bitcoin has potential. Right now it's purely speculative, and that won't change until the volatility drops dramatically. That may never happen because the community that has formed around Bitcoin is primarily engaged in speculation.
Digitial currencies wil work at some point, but I don't see it happening with BTC.
