What would full bore by iran look like? Would they buy up bitcoin and use it as a reserve to back their own currency? Not sure what full bore looks like

Last April while I was at work in a DataCenter, some analyst came in on the weekend and mentioned Bitcoin. I already knew a little about it and thought it was stupid but I liked the guy and wanted to entertain the idea so I could call it stupid without sounding like an ass. Turns out I knew nothing about it and our talk turned into a "damn how do i get some? I only want one you know in case it takes off." kind of talks. He ended up buying like 40 back in the $100 range and I have like 17 now from when they were in the $100s. I sold my silver lol good move.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:15:03

Shes right but just because someones floods the market doesnt really hurt anything btc will be back. If someone buys up it will only increase the price  as long as btc is denominated in fiat i dont really see the problem

I had that same problem mining scrypt coins, i wasn't good at it right away so i mined btc instead, this was a year ago however. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:22:39
I liked the idea of a coin with a set amount on a private key inside the coin that is accepted as a medium of exchange. If someone wants to cash it they have to open it which also destroys the coin
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:17:15
no possible way. The guy who invented bitcoin is a math genius along with an economics degree and a coding background. What does physics have to do with anything???
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:45:27
Oh  i guess the larger the community the more problematic that could be  
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:51:10
I remember when they 30 everyone was like sellllllll selll
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:02:12
Spending bitcoin is the same as selling it. Too many sellers not enough buyers. New coins are created everyday, they need to be absorbed. The bitcoin ecosystem simply isnt large enough to handle the inflation and keep a consistent price imo
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:50:04

@_date: 2014-07-12 14:07:58
That and the cia plans to use btc to fund the overthrow of unfriendly foriegn governments. Think of the uses a semi anonymous form of money has for a secretive agency.
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:52:07
I my time in the btc community, I have noticed that just because you were an early adopter doesn't mean you kept with it. It's like the nerds are too busy being nerds to stop at one thing, that's what makes them nerds. amiwrong? I can GUARANTEE I would have done exactly as you and lost them all by not backing up.

@_date: 2014-03-17 02:49:13
yea I actually started out with 21, spent a couple on a video card, cashed out a little. Typical stuff, I have a hard time holding onto things. See silver, I also had some Iraqi dinars. lol I'm a bad investor. They are all cold storage though know, i have .3 to spend as I want to but when that's gone I'm going to try and leave the rest alone.

bad example, pizza drivers make good money, the net gain is substantial. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:01:48
True for sure. My point is that nothing required to make bitcoin was even mentioned. Also without formal training that makes him even more of a super man having taught himself everything.

@_date: 2019-03-15 22:33:54
That's a bummer dude. That's like my biggest nightmare. Can I help you figure it out at all? maybe get a fresh pair of eyes on it. More so i can try to help but i would understand if you don't want to lol. If it is two transposed words i would imagine the words are close together and if you just switch each pair of words with the one to its right and left and test those combos maybe that would work. or looks at words that might be similar to another word and try switching those. i don't know just stuff i would try in that situation 
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:03:54
I switched to cash app. Wayy faster but the price is higher.

He might be right but a Chase bank account for a person who doesn't make a lot of money gets shafted left and right with fees. So not sure how he can say that with a straight face.

@_date: 2019-08-06 20:55:35
Totally agree that Hal is not Satoshi. I also don't think Hal has any idea who Satoshi and it kinda makes sense that Satoshi didn't even have a name and relied on Hal to give him one lol. Satoshi doesn't sit around thinking of cool names, at least not in those days. He was focused on one thing, especially if he is some kind of savant or autist. Really makes me wonder who this person is and their background.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:49:37
I like it personally it because its super simple and no fee. Just a high spread but for smaller amounts its much cheaper than coinbase or other traditional exchanges that charge you each purchase
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:53:29
Can confirm

You can buy all at once now or buy a little every week and average your cost. Either way works
