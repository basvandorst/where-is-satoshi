They fight for years and can't stop.

I am not sure if that would be so easy or even possible if i took cocain or crack or some other shit.

on side - yes - I just wanted to point out, that they could have "something big" from me ... now they have nothing
on the other - when stable RAID is usable - so u get "reputation"
lets say average nodes lose that in X%, I would lose in 0.1X% - better reputation - more "customers"/data/trust ==&gt; more money ==&gt; better for all - it all just depends - if its worth it (and yes, I assume not) - those ones are just some half-unused servers

and NASA flights
and Brazil &amp; Kenya &amp; Russia &amp; China govs/schools ...
and 95?% routers &amp; wifis
and 100% of my computers :P
I like when some1 these days says - I don't use Linux. yeah u used it already 100x this morning, by checkin FB, GM and twitter.
Without tapping your smartshit with Windows mobile, cause u got all over 10 routers etc.
**And we would have NO INTERNET without linux!**
We would have MSN or AT shit with huge 10mil pages a overspeedy 10kbits for every1. And you play only 1 cent per minute. Checking emails are free. And new technology is coming in next few decades - sound over internet.
Internet helped linux and **linux allowed internet to spread 1000x faster** - but 1000x faster multiplied by network effect = brazzillion faster.
So that's how bitcoin can cange world in my opinion.
Synergic effect 1+1=3, maybe 100. + another 1 = maybe 4500 + another 1 = 1 mil?

Not me &amp; maybe not him.
I never used a chopper, lets forbid them.
Many ppl very often send many over the internet - $2 or $2mil - who cares.
I would like to buy/sell car (which i dol every 5 years but sellers does like 5-50 times a month) - buy clicking on my phone.
Not going to this and that department - only in working hours - cant afford, not wasting 6 hours there and using paper &amp; pen - even tho my country payed bilions for e-gov and e-citizen shit.
Thats bitcoin for me.
Having my passport &amp; all IDs &amp; $100 in my phone.
When stolen - get to internet and 1 click - LOCK ALL, another 1 click - get new one to new phone.
A nice option for me.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:34:52

I didnt understand your point at the first time correctly. Sry :)
Not native english speaker - as u can see/read :P
I think at least for 95% in world and 70+% in EU/UK/US/CA countries is bitcoin very usefull.
For different ppl it will be different reasons of course.
And once they will find out - they will start using it - and finding more &amp; more reasons (they didnt see/realize/tested (or even exists)) why to use bitcoin &amp; to recomend to friends &amp; families.


Let it be :)

You dont have to put 401K into it.
Put your daily spendings (automatically) - if u lost it - np i think.
"personal conversion" from dont need to happen in 1 second - can take 10 years 
Like noone 100% replaced smail to email in 1 day - but maybe in 1 year.
90% companies still use snail mail (after 30 years!!) - no problem with that.
Even i have to use it sometimes. But like 5 times a year for official reasons living in shit country right now.
Every shit gov/tax sends me is over smail. But its like 0.001% of my comms.
I still prefer sometimes pen &amp; paper over smartphone/PC ...
Does it mean internet/tablets/ebooks has no future?
We still have cinemas &amp; paper books &amp; can buy CDs - and thats GOOD - that we have options. ;)
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:50:00
Again &amp; again its not 100% replacement.
Its same like email - in 1996 hotmail.
Read &amp; learn about it.
Hmm, i will try this new stuff.
Click webpage - hmm - signup - hmmm.
Send $5 from your bank account.
Use it!
AHA effect - great it works ...
Dont have to understand TCP/IP &amp; DNS to send email.
Dont have to be math pro to crypt using own brain (cant do myself and know shit about crypto), dont have to understand money, economics, FIAT, in/deflation /// (advantage, but optional).
Just use it - on a webserver.

Please elaborate &amp; name countries.
I think not possible for 90-95% countries today.
And in many "instantly" cases u "instantly receive" money - but cant instantly use.
Friend of mine put 10K DEM (Deutsche marks - before euro) cash to _his_ account in German bank cash, and he couldnt use it for 3 working days - even in the same branch - he couldnt even to cash em out back - next 5 days - his cash - now in his account.
Not blocked, not fked but gov, not suspicious, not charged - free man with "his free" money.
Yeah banks are very bad - even if they dont kill/rob&amp;mob.
And of course he payed for this services like $20/month + $5 for "cash operation".

so we are in 1992 - 1996? maybe? who cares?
buy buy buy /joke
OK, so 2008-2010 was 1970-1980 arpanet
2011-2013 was gopher
2014 was 1993? OK
so we are going 2-7x faster ...
and it can be accelerated more
Is it possible that 1% of all E-shops will accept BTC in 2017? Sure! Is it speedy enough - guess so.
Because 1% to 10% _all_ E-shops can growth in 2 years. Than bitcoin+internet+ppl won!
but in 2015 doubling can occur (we can say that only in 2016)

did airbags deploy? :P
In 1980? only 20% of villages in Russia had electricity. And they had hundreds of nukes that time.
Bitcoin can change it to few/no nukes but every1 has access to internet ...
Yeah ty for your comment
