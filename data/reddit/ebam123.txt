Why hit BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:34:40
Oh ok so 0.003 bitcoins to mine 2 bitcoins is a bit of a scam... lesson learnt and it’s expensive

Yeah it’s market psychology, if you sell an asset generally it goes downhill.
If one buys an asset generally it goes up.

The problem is the transaction says pending is there anyway one can withdraw from a pending transaction ??

They could probably assuming they own several billion I imagine any big holder of bitcoin can create downward pressure on the market and short term volatility...

Yeah my wife is about to blow our savings on bitcoin, she even bought at close to the recent high of 20,000 dollars 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:31:38
She sent it through bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:14:43
Well there goes £20k down the drain...
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:37:13
This genuinely happened, I told my wife it’s a scam but she seemed pretty desperate as we have about 20,000 of debt to pay...

Hmmm that’s the wisest thing to do, sell on the way up.
But you have to know that at the top of the market it’s likely the whole bitcoin system is unstable and liquidity is harder as exchanges tend to get overloaded and crash.

I already have a child with her ( new born). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:36:20
Nope this just happened 2 hours ago...
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:40:53
:( I thought $400 of transaction fee for 2 bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:09
Hmmmm 
I thought when it crashed now is the time to use any spare cash to catch the bounce. But I doubt that when it’s at all time lows I’ll be able to easily login and buy and sell, due to the exchanges crashing...

@_date: 2018-03-24 19:22:53
