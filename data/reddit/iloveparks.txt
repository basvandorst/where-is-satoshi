Whoo! Running a full node!

I really appreciate the extra info, I am starting to learn about inputs &amp; outputs, and figured that had something to do with it. For some reason it took out way more than it needed to and sent the change to a new address, I think that was why it wanted to charge me such a high fee(and why I lowered it dramatically.)

Final question: 90% certain I have a legacy address in MyCelium, there will be no issues if I send the BTC to a SegWit address when transferring to my LNS, right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:38:15
Thanks again for all your help. I found an option in MyCelium to just bump up the fee by sending another transaction, I didn't need to send my whole balance. Starting to see some confirmations now. Now I can rest easy and test sending to a SegWit address with a minimal amount before sending the remainder.

Oh, and if I decide I am impatient and want to send my BTC to my LNS before the previous transaction clears, I can send my entire balance from MyCelium, with a decent sized fee, and then both transactions should be picked up and sent to their respective addresses, correct?

Does anyone have any sort of idea when they will support all US states? 
I live in one of the 3 they do not support. :(

Is there any way for me to see what the "clock" is on my transaction?

I always thought that you also needed fast upload speed too? If you don't need fast upload, I'm gonna spin up a VM tonight and start running a Node!

I finally get my LNS today, I can't wait to feel much more secure about my Bitcoin.

Thanks for all your help.

Not true, I bought BTC at 11.9 on Coinbase during the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:36
Wow, yeah not available in my state. Didn't realize they got that granular..
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:04:35
So, its going to be a looooooong while then probably, right?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:02
Drat.. Any idea how long I might have to wait? I thought I read that certain Nodes would drop transactions with no confirmations after 3 days.. It sounds like that is not correct.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:00
Ok, I used a fee of 26 sats/byte.. Looks like there are still 7.9k unconfirmed transactions in that range.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:15
Without a doubt!
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:11:05
In the 2020s(what OP said) is a lot different than 2020.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:08:59
I always hate this line.
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:16:02
Already sold that garbage.

1700 - just before the Coinbase listing - unfortunately I wasn't privy to the insider information, but hey, I'll take some free money anyway.
