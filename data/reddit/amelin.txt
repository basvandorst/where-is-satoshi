That is the guy who has been providing all the updates since late April and his website is linked to from  since May.

I've never held gold and silver, I normally only invest in shares but have diverted 2% of my portfolio value to Bitcoin.

Same here and yes, tentatively it seems like progress. I had mentally written off the money already as lost, but maybe the efforts of their lawyer has paid off.
Also noticed they are linking to a new ticket system at

I would trust an exchange more if it has been put through hell and survived than if it has never had difficulties. If BTC24 starts operating and the market has sufficient depth then I'd trade there.

And here's a [video]( to learn a little more about them and why they are important.

Minimising charges makes a lot of sense when transactions are insured (or providers are generally highly reliable) and you're going to do a lot of transactions. 
In an environment like Bitcoin where a lot of exchanges [close]( you may want to think about putting priority on protecting your capital instead. 
Splitting your transaction across multiple exchanges or at least over an extended time period will cost a little more but avoid a worst-case outcome where you lose all $4000.

National currencies do fluctuate enormously. 
Check out what happened to [pound &lt;-&gt; euro rates]( a few years ago or [dollar &lt;-&gt; pound rates]( These are enormous currencies with central banks that work to stabilise them.
Because Bitcoin is a vastly smaller market, with no central backing and in a very early developmental stage we're seeing such swings on an almost daily basis. This effect will reduce when Bitcoin gets a user base of hundreds of millions of people (rather than tens of thousands) and more business is done in BTC-only with no conversion to fiat currencies.

Yep, down.

You may want to think about using more than one exchange so that you don't end up locked out of the market if MgGox is under DDOS attack or otherwise down. That will also help limit your losses in case there is fraud or a successful hack against one exchange.

There are no safe exchanges, there are multiple risks that you need to consider:
- Legal enforcement (any exchange that doesn't fully comply with laws about money laundering is at risk)
- Hostile or risk-averse banks (many exchanges including MtGox have had accounts shut)
- Fraud (the operators of the exchange may walk away with your deposits)
- Hacking (several exchanges have been hacked as the size of deposits and value of bitcoin increases they become more tempting targets)
Consider using a risk-mitigation strategy of having accounts at multiple exchanges, never having more money than you can afford to lose at a single exchange and storing your BTC offline as much as possible. This needs to be weighed against your trading strategy needs (no problem for LTBH, difficult for day-trading) and transaction costs (international money transfers and currency conversion can be expensive depending on where you and the exchange bank).

Well, that pretty much sinks the tedious argument in mainstream media that BTC can't be used for anything but pizza and drugs.
