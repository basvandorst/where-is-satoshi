Me too.

That's right, drcross... You have a point. I didn't really expected much of a feedback, exactly because we live in this screwed up world. 
I don't want to put a target sign on anyone's back, so I am dropping it...

This must have a psychological reason rather than a safety related one. Most people must feel better having to double authorize everything, but this is only the beginning, i guess... In the future people may care less about electronic money and even discard the password for small amounts.

That is correct. A Thousandarie is what I originally wanted to say. I screwed up with mathematics here. I thought of it because of the symbolic aspects of being a "Millionaire". And how a Crypt Currency "Millionaire" would be essentially different from a US Dollar one.

You are telling me that there is no one, right now, with that amount of coins around? Miners? Primary investors? Nobody? :"(

Thanks a lot for the feedback! 
I See! Actually what really interests me is the fact that I believe that most of the big fishes in the Bitcoin business are, in fact, living not very different lives they used to live before the boom (Am I more or less right here?). That's the story for me. I chose Hundredaires because I am ignorant and thought that that would be a lot of coins for nowadays. What would be a good number of Bitcoins to make the story more, lets say, meaningful therefore?
