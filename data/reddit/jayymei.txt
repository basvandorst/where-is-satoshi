Even though this has been reposted 5 times today, I will always upvote it.

You stated that the customer pays more if they use a credit card, which is not true because the customer would be paying the same amount if they were paying with cash. Boom. Lawyered. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:16:24


This is not true. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:03
Nope. Hodl hodl hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:04:54
....as it rises past 11k. Bad time to post this article. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:50:47
The thumbnail gave me aids
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:42
Or $30k. To the moon!
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:24:09
It’s almost like one of those **A**utomated **T**eller **M**achines, but like, for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:11:36
Yeah but don’t you see the value you are getting? Right now 2 bitcoins is approximately $27,000 USD. I would definitely throw down $7.99 to get these 2!
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:03:46
Why did you post when Bitcoin is back up over 11k already? So much spam on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:22:14
That was sooo 2017. Catch up, Gretchen.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:09:36
Pretty sure this a bot account similar to the Fred one. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:15:07
No, you seem to be the retarded one. Please explain how I am paying in the end. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:18:58
So sell when it's low, then buy back when it's higher. Sounds like a great way to lose money. Thank you sir!

There is no anxiety when you HODL. To the moon!

Third time posted today
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:07:48
Still waiting for a response, FYI. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:48:45
No thank you
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:40:34
No. If I go to McDonald's and buy a McDouble, I will be paying $1.30 whether I pay with cash, CC, or debit. I will not be paying an extra 2 cents just for using a CC.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:56:59
My BTC that I bought for $150 say otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:35:22
Lol because all this guy does is spam the sub with links. He hasn’t actually commented on anything in 229 days. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:31:49
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:07:52
I’ll meet you at 30k. Dilly dilly!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:49:51
To the moon. Dilly dilly!
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:46:22
Please stop spamming

There seems to be a trend here: people joining reddit and immediately thinking they are Crypto know it alls. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:44:48
This is literally already on the front page. Please delete
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:22:57
Thank you Mr. -40 Karma Man

Thank you for your insights Redditor For 2 Months. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:16
That's so not fetch.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:34:52
Say "normalization of prizes" one more time. Maybe you will sound smarter next time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:39:14

The people who bought at $16k will also say otherwise when it hits $30k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:34:12
This is not true
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:15
You obviously don’t understand crypto then. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:46:51
Who is panicking? Lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:06:18
This is not true. If I buy a $1 cheeseburger at McDonald’s it does not cost me 1% extra. It costs the same amount as if you were paying with cash. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 02:23:25
Lol. No. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:13:21
What do you mean? It was over 10k yesterday 
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:13:38
Lol.
