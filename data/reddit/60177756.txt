An exchange inside the country would not be able to bring any more BTC into the country unless it were bringing something out.

For someone with infinite time and infinite money, yes. For everyone else, [risk is a real thing with negative value](

No government could sustain a 51% attack until we lose interest though...

The government is attempting to lock down any payment methods out of the country; how would someone in Argentina deposit non-USD currency to an external exchange?

I don't think so.

It's the coins not being spent that affects the market.

halving the rate of increase of supply != halving supply

It would be absurdly expensive though, to pay the fees on enough transactions to have that kind of impact.

Gold: an early fiat currency.

They can only continue exporting pesos if there's something they're importing. Bitcoins are safe and easy to import, and have higher utility in Argentina than in most places due to their suitability as a currency for untaxed international transactions.

No. What it implies is that the user receives less compensation for taking risk than the service provider would be willing to accept.

There's demand for money in a form where it can readily be used internationally without paying the tax; this operation would meet that demand by providing Bitcoin. The illegal portion of the operation would also be compatible with other ways to do that, but Bitcoin seems like a potentially great option.

Someone enterprising soul needs to start smuggling pesos/liquid assets out of the country in order to operate an exchange where people can buy BTC for pesos without the tax...

1024 keys could be tried with a perl one-liner in a few seconds. You'd need to generate a lot more fake pieces than that to be effective, although the efficacy does grow exponentially - the problem would be distributing enough in legitimate-seeming ways.

I think as long as most people believe the hash rate is adequate for security and will remain adequate for security for the reasonably near future, the variation in "how secure", impossible to quantify, will hold little weight in people's considerations, and will naturally have little effect on the market value.

18% of this currency is being actively traded, most of the people who own it own it as an investment, and you're wondering where the rest of it is? I don't know what you look at bitcoin as being but as a currency the proportion of it that's being exchanged at any given time is obscene.
