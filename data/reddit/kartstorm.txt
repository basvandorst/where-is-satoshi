Oh I missed that. Thanks.

Pm sent to talk over details and such. It's definitely an interesting research project.

Wow $1 is pretty generous compared to a lot of the online faucet's I've been to.
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:12:26
Thank you. It's very much appreciated. :)

Nice site.
Whoa you never mentioned the Java Bitcoin Programming section. :)

I'd be interested in this.

While only time will tell what happens and if the people organize to make someone a millionaire. I feel that in the meantime the subreddit could be benificial. And even if anyone could get $1000 by working extra. That could have a very benifical impact on someones life who's struggling with bills or college tuition or just needs some extra money for their family. Which is why I'm optimistic that good will come from this experiment. Also as an added bonus people could learn more about bitcoin (other payment systems could be used I guess for $1000). Just my 2 cents.

Wow this is amazing. Now it makes me want to have my own laser so I can make my own metal wallet. Thanks for sharing!

I've used Coinbase and have had no problems. Though I don't have a credit card so they used my bank which took 5 days to get my bitcoin.

Do you mean like 
You enter the value in USD or BTC and it will show you the value.
Also if you leave the page up it will update the price every few seconds.
Even the title bar in your browser will show the value.

Any clues on 5? Been working on this for hours. I think I have the rest. Also the brainwallet I'm using generates different addresses depending on case. Is this all lowercase?

Wow seems very useful.

1. Save some for the future.
2. Buy something tangible with it like a pizza.
3. Use ChangeTip and tip someone.

Did you hear Coinbase now has an option in their Android App that alerts you when Bitcoin falls below a price you set?

Had to convince the internet watch-guards I wasn't sending spam emails. I can keep scanning but I have to slow it down. This is going to take a while....
Nonetheless I press on!

Well I think it's time for me to stop scanning the whole ipv4 address space. I'd be interested if the contest changed format so I'll keep a look out for that. Checking 4 Billion IP addresses even when the processes has been automated by scripts is taking too long.

If this ever goes to court I wonder if the judge will understand the technology behind bitcoin seeing as some judges seem to be unable or not wanting to keep up with technology.
