We know they exist, it's whether or not anyone has the private keys to be able to move them.

Yes, all bitcoin transactions are able to be followed.

If someone already knows the original address, they would know you have 1000BC in it. Other transactions after that point would link it to you a bit more, however if you send it through a few addresses there's no reasonable way to tell that you own all of them and they aren't some other person's addresses, so long as you don't use them twice.

Oh wow, looks even better than I thought it would, thanks!

First bitcoin purchase I've made after buying some! Feels great.

This answered all of the questions I had when I first learned about bitcoins. Wish it was around sooner.

You expecting it to drop more or surge back up again?

Sold 2/3 of mine at 824.88... feel like an idiot. Will buy back in if it gets that low again. (Bought at 210 so it is still a gain, but stings to see it go up again)

I've heard it brought up independently 3 times int he past 2 weeks, and had heard it brought up once before that besides when I was telling people. It is definitely getting around.

*cough* could you share it with us?

Of course there are, however my job pays in fiat and it's a lot better fit for my current skillset than what people in are looking for, and I'd rather not beg, like I said, I have been able to get them through coinbase.
