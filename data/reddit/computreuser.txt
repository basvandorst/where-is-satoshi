Basically Ghash.io is slowly on its way to being able to control how you spend your bitcoins.
Currency of the future!

They don't even get the bitcoins though. They're sold off before they get to overstock.

So it's not actually money.

It drives home the point that bitcoin isn't seen as a currency, but just some commodity to be sold for an actual currency

As long as they are turned into a real currency first.

I dunno I thought it was worth a brand new discussion.

Right and coinbase takes your tokens and turns them back to real money that the business actually wants since they can't use your tokens to pay employees or buy goods.
Seems like the tickets at Chuckie Cheese are more of a real currency at this point. At least you can trade those directly for prizes.

Would you really call Chuckie Cheese tokens a currency?

So you can't pay people in bitcoins? I thought it was a currency.

Seems like a rather large flaw with Bitcoin's basic infrastructure. Should an organization with most of the miners be able to control the flow of money like that?
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:54:21
So basically the organization could completely control how you spend your money.
Still sounds pretty scary? And still sounds like they basically do control where all the money goes?
