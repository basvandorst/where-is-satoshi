Wealth creation ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:24
Shit i just did, back to 11.5K. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:04:29
I though the purpose was to not depend on dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:31:41
I’m not the one who deployed an immature technology, and calling it a revolution. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:33:37
Good luck to you. Hopefully you live with your mom and don’t have to pay for rent and food. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:42:47
Do you do emergency brain surgery ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:55:01
Please remind me again, what can you buy with Bitcoins ?
Edit: it seems you can buy pizza in Arizona and subscribe to VPN services. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:09:48
Right, but in that case Bitcoin is the first car ever made, ready to be replaced by a more advanced one. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:32:42
You’re just upset your investment lost value and have to blame it on someone, even though you know you’re wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:41
Average means nothing in this case without knowing the mean and different percentiles. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:26:31
Could also be « shit ». 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:44:48
By getting rich instead of « them » ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:18:02
This is going to cost slightly more than the $93 million dollars :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:28:37
That’s a good example that there is actually very little money coming in. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:01:34
As in how much actual money people throw everyday to buy Bitcoins ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:40:01
Lol, just admit you wanted to know before hand in order to buy it somewhere else and make profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:09:03
It’s up again because loonies want to pay $16K for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:59:12
Good, that’s the type of behavior that leads to financial crisis. Let’s go boys !
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:00:36
What ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:23:20
What is this calculation ? 40 years at minimum wage will not make you close to $1.8M. A large part of the US are on minimum wage or very close to. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:55:21
Smart ? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:51
What about 50% dips ? 10.5K on Coinbase as I write this. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:21:55
Why would decentralized mean it cannot be regulated ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:15
Come on, almost there, 288K unconfirmed 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:27
People investing a lot of money to try to get something to work does not constitute an ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:44:38
Then it must be that the purpose of Bitcoin is not to be a global medium of exchange, or someone forgot to display a « Beta » somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:15:19
That would be a great South Park superhero. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:08:14
3.8 transactions per second. Ouch. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:50:13
It still is. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:35:41
The world’s economy being unsustainable does not mean BTC is sustainable and would be some kind of replacement. 
I love The Matrix but if you really think about the last quote, it does apply to pretty much anything one can be a part of, such as BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:16:17
Was it accurate or was it rigged ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:44:05
Lol « there’s 0 risk » 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:11:55
What did you smoke ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:00:18
Thanks for posting this, I wanted to make similar points but did not have the words. 
I’ve been reading comments on r/bitcoin for some time now and am concerned about the cult-like mindset of many people on this subreddit. People are giving up reason in exchange of beliefs and a sense of « community ». 
Many users bluntly admit speculating and contributing to a pyramide scheme and encourage their entourage to bet their money, for their own personal gain. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:48:04
I don’t know about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:56:40
All ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:48
Well there is the risk of being charged with money laundering. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:55:43
It works out for some people, just like investing in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:36
I’m not sure if this is sarcasm or you are actually encouraging other people to speculate for personal gain with disregard of what happens after you cash out, or try to. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:15
And what do we do once there is no more US dollars incoming from the pyramid scheme ?
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:43:56
Why would you want to live in Dubai ?
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:21:48
You must have a nice credit score. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:21:03
You mean the slaves ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:42:47
Buyers ? What buyers ?
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:37:53
Just remember that whatever money you’re putting in, he’s taking out.
