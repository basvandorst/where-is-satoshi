Done it yesterday. Already up 10 % ! It's not because I love bitcoin that I will not short it. I prefer money.

That's the spirit

Same bank says for 2018 : "Investors flee Bitcoin as governments strike back, Bitcoin @ $1,000 (-90%)"
So I guess they disagree.

Why would you use bitcoin ?

To read such differents and extreme points of view means the bubble is bursting right now.

Bubble is bursting
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:50:09
Yeah but for now they don't make prediction on the past. For now.

Analysts are just people who are making money on peoples greed, but the truth is that no one has a clue
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:37:59
It's obviously the end of the bubble. Everybody knows it, but greed is powerful.

What did you buy with it ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:18:50
I love to see the bitcoin price dropping. Feels so good. I'm going to buy so many coins when it reaches 2k$.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:47:51
Let the holders hold if they want to hold. Let the holder sell if they want to sell. And let the sellers rebuy 5x more coins when price is 2k ;) ah ah ah ah ah holders are so funny
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:13:54


This. Holders are so funny. They made my day :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:46:34
I sold everything two weeks ago and it is pure happiness since. I actually enjoy the crash.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:57:17
Who said the price will go up indefinitely ? We may never reach 10k$ again. Do you realize that ? The smart holders have sold everything long ago in december. Don't wait the end of the bubble to sell lol, sell on top !
