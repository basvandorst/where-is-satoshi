Yes, but if you can buy it with your tax advantaged funds and it’s the only way that you think you can get exposure, some people will do it.  Imagine the average person, and know that 50% of all people out there are less intelligent.  It’s not too bad if you can enter the trade at a much lower premium, but you are getting ripped off with any premium that high.

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:28:47
No.  It’s a closed end fund, which means no change to the assets within.  It will be valued at its net asset value (NAV) no matter if it traded below bitcoin price (discount) or above (premium).  It’s scarce, can’t be shorted, and people really want exposure and that is why the premium goes so high.  If GBTC tanks to below bitcoin price, it will be a discount to bitcoin itself which is another way of saying Bitcoin on sale.

Relax, friend.  All exchanges are swamped with new deposits, new members, etc.  it used to be faster but my 4 separate deposits went from 2 days to 3 days to 3 days again to 11 days for the money to hit my account after wire.  I think all exchanges are understaffed, they weren’t prepared for such an influx.  Your money is there, you didn’t lose it, you just don’t have access to it and that’s unfortunate.

Government regulators and lobbying/financial interests are a revolving door.  It’s movement between those that regulate and those that are regulated.  Goldman, for instance, has numerous recent hires that were once members of the Federal Reserve, the SEC and Justice Department.  Goldman executives also go on to be appointed as high ranking government officials after they “retire” from private employment.  It behooves them to have a excellent working relationship with those that regulate them, and what better way to achieve that than have former and future coworkers as your regulators.

You can’t short it if you can’t borrow it.  In the beginning rates will be too high to short, options will be the most likely route.

Bitcoin will never replace the USD because most of the major wallets belong to Geeky McSpanksalot and Dark Web Pirates.

I understand where you are coming from, I’ve traded all of that for the past dozen years professionally.  I thought there would have been a lot of bag holders from the crash in 2008-2009, but somehow it kept on chugging.  Silver shorts never paid the price, GLD somehow still exists, and don’t get me started on the Tesla stock price.  
Let me know when times get tough, because when they do no one is going to care what the price of Bitcoin is, or if their gold ETF has gold backing it.  There will be more serious things to be concerned about.  
I’ve stopped reading Zerohedge almost completely.  Love the reporting but overly negative and almost never correct in the long term.

It’s cash settled.  They can short the futures to zero if they want to, but it still settles to Bitcoin real world spot price.  All of these eager dip buyers should prevent the market for crashing.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:58:05
Futures aren’t options.  You can either buy or sell the futures contract that is set to expire at the contract expiration date.  The futures contract can trade at a premium or discount to the true spot price and only at expiration will it settle at the settlement price.   This leaves plenty of room for Wall Street shenanigans.
Edit:  Please read up on derivatives, especially futures and options.  In your above call purchase scenario, you are buying the right to purchase 1 BTC at 10000 for a cost of $1000.  At expiration date to break even, BTC has to be at $11000 (option price + cost).  If BTC is 9990, you would lose full value of your option as it expired worthless, you lost $1000.  Above 10000, your option would be valid but remember that you paid $1000 for the right to purchase, so if BTC is $10500, you actually lost $500.

A big part of the population is not trading in the futures market, but a big part of the population is affected by the trading in the futures market.  This is how the banksters have suppressed the price of gold and silver for many, many years.

I have a family to think about, so I’m reluctantly paying.  I won’t wish you ill will or good luck, what happens, happens.  
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:01:49
That’s pretty comical, but I’m sure you meant well.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:06:23
I guess I just don’t understand then.

I did a chunk, took out 2x original investment after New Years.  Now no stress investing.  
Don’t put too much weight on other commenters advice.  Think how stupid the average person is and remember that half of the commenters are probably below that.

I don’t follow TA at all.  I’m a trader in equity and futures markets as well as crypto.  
I was saying don’t equate wealth with brains.  There are idiot billionaires, and poor geniuses.

If you don’t pay, then my taxes will be used for your room and board in a federal prison.  I’d like a better utilization than that.  Subsidized healthy school lunches maybe? Think of the children!  
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:18:13
Agreed.  No problem with B of A.  Multiple deposits and withdrawals, no issues.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:59:02
That’s a pretty stupid question.

I did, and sent all my trades in as well.  Let them audit the low hanging fruit.

Oops, he’s libertarian, not Democrat.  Won’t get the votes because he won’t pass out freebies to the masses.

Tesla died poor, and he was one of the most brilliant minds to ever walk the earth.  Don’t equate wealth with right and wrong.

I see what you did there.

Why are they always located in vape shops and liquor stores?  Interesting clientele choices.

I don’t want to find out.  I’m paying.

Oh man, $70 lost. That’s equivalent.

Do you actually think my taxes matter?  They can print up as much fiat as they want as long as other countries buy Treasuries.  You are just using a convenient excuse not to pay your taxes.  
I don’t get a say in how my taxes are spent, my vote counts as little as yours does.  I don’t get a choice on who is my president (Clinton and Trump both TERRIBLE choices).  And I won’t shed a single tear if you get punished for not paying your taxes.  Take your child killer rhetoric, wrap it around a cactus, and insert it into your rectum.

Volkswagen was briefly the largest market cap company in the world back in 2008 due to a short squeeze.  Google it, it was a pretty amazing time to be trading.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:05:13
Because they can.  I’m with you, I don’t like paying, it’s not patriotic, it’s the law.  You want crypto to suffer, give them more reason to regulate the hell out of it.  
If crypto taxes aren’t paid, they will try to kill crypto.  That’s how I see it.  Sorry for the attack.  I hate war.  
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:59:33
Uhh....  No thanks.

I watched it. I can come up with my own conclusions, I don’t need them spoon fed to me.  I shed no tear for Ross.  
It wasn’t just about drugs, and it wasn’t just about Bitcoin.  You should stop being so condescending about strangers on the internet.  I might just be your real father.

There is a guy selling custom wood boxes for Trezors on here.  He could make you a custom wooden mining box for the low low price of $2999.  Best German craftsmanship.

You can educate them yourself as well.  My kids are fairly young but even they know the USD is backed by faith and a strong military, not gold.  They know the difference between quarters minted before 1965, and after.  It’s fun to watch them learn and figure out how the world actually works.

Is PFR an abbreviation for PoorForeveR?  I don’t get it.  And I can’t unsee it.

Never say never.  We will see 10k again within a few months.  A lot of FUD has passed.  Regulation really won’t be that bad, and THEY had to do it.
