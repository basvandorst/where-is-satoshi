you can transfer your funds off before it opens, i sent my btc home immediately after it shut down
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:00:25
agreed. btc-e has cloudflare and goes down just as well
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:49:35

your API looks just like mtgox's API.. is this a coinkidinky or are you using the same code base?

I appreciate your insight and experience with a volatile commodity. However I must ask: Why would you compare the two? You cant send silver to your friend on the opposite end of the Earth in 10 minutes for less than a dollar.  You can't store an immense amount of wealth in silver and secure it in your estate.  It just doesn't make sense to me to compare them.

oh, it's a joke.. i get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:56:03
I already tried.

The reason is that there were outstanding orders that needed to be "funded".. Once funds became available in that account whether they deposited cash or BTC, the order executed.   You could take down your orders, but could not submit any new ones.  
Someone just forgot (or didnt mind) to take their order down before they added funds.   (This is an explanation from MagicTux)
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:37:15
man this sounds way better......  i wanted to know if it would be feasible to do a different scale for bid and ask, so now you know if it was a huge ask or huge bid that went thru..
even so, GREAT JOB!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:41:28
that's a pretty good idea actually.. mtgox clients will be able to port over to your api pretty easily.   another developer and I spent a great deal of time on this idea that we would build a single UI that would interface with all major exchanges to give you an entire view of your portfolio and possibly identify opportunities for arbitrage.. 
we lost steam however, as it was a side project for us both and having full time jobs got the best of us.
I'm glad you guys are going full legit, it sounds promising.  Thanks for the gold and good luck!
found an old droplr of the ui:

7 2 off suit?
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:58:23
holy shit, people actually use this? this is my repo.. i havent made any updates for a while.. would you mind submitting a fix and ill merge it in?
edit: this client should not require the user to enable withdrawal.. hopefully nobody is that dumb !!
edit i see that this isnt just a simple fix.. im thinking about pulling in bouncy castle and using AES with a user generated key and IV..  ill have to dedicate some time to this.. thanks for pointing it out

wow 4 2's.. im glad you didnt get shot.   pocket queens is my nemesis. i'll always bet pocket SMAX (J's).. and if i win i yell 'SMACKS MATE!'  .. havent played in a while, i love the game.  i havent had much luck on the NL tables..  the most i won was one of those side games called ultimate texas holdem.. i hit a spade royal on a $15 bet, came out with $2700.

Yeah what dillpickle said.  Your transaction is already on "the blockchain".  Open your browser and go to:  long public address here} to see it.    As we have never seen a ticket, we can't tell you how to move those coins from the paper wallet to online or offline wallet
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:18:15
because everybody thinks that lag = panic.  everybody is anticipating that atleast some people will panic, so what do most people do? remove their high bids and place them lower to try and get a better position.   this, in effect, causes more panic as youll have sellers wanting to scoop the high bids, driving the price down lower due to the bids moving back anticipating retrace.. and as each seller tries to "out ask" each other, the ask wall starts to descend south as well... this is key. once enough asks shift down, the ddos'ers complete the cycle by buying up all the newly retreating asks.. getting a discount on BTC (determined by the level of panic they've caused).
this is just my theory though.   also.. this trick wont last for long, people are noticing the patterns and i think are more reluctant to give into the fear

I agree, Bitcoin is not backed by utility.  I believe Bitcoin is backed by the trust of the people who utilize it, which is to say that it is backed by the secure peer-to-peer network it was built upon.  As long as people can trust this network to work as intended, Bitcoin will have value.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:31:18
well i guess that settles that then
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:03:14
For a good time, call!
