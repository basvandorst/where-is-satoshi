Oh wow a dated technology is trying to predict the future of other technology. This paper waste has been left in the dust. $4 for some paper? Has anyone shown this company the internet yet?

Well worded, thanks!

Well most obvious way, just buy bitcoins.
I'm not very familiar with mining but I do know it's getting more difficult to mine so not sure the cost vs profit on it

I did a lot of research into Bitclub because someone I recently met really wanted me to join...
turns out Bitclub is more along the lines of MLM multi level marketing company, whos product is bitcoin mining but in reality the money is mostly made from getting referrals to join. 
One of their members talked to me on the phone to try and convince me to join but revealed that it took him a year from late 2016 to this year to earn his $3,500 fee to join, and break even (just from mining alone). Had he just bought $3,500 worth of bitcoin instead of joining the club he would have much more money now.
I will say they are making money getting referrals and mining, but I'm just not the type to go around get people to join a MLM so it's not for me.
Plus the people I talked to acted like they knew alot about Bitcoin but in reality they are just spewing stuff they heard. When I was using terms most of us would be familiar with in here like even names of some popular alt coins, they were a little confused and went back to talking about bitcoin. So its mostly just bitcoin newbs trying to sell you on a referral program.
