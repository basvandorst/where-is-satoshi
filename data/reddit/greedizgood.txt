FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE"
" "
" Maintenance Announcement Effecting Bitcoin transfers!
" "
Tokyo, Japan, February 15th, 2014!
Dear Mt. Gox Customers,"
In order to implement our solution to the “transaction malleability” issue being 
faced by bitcoin exchanges and businesses, we are going to have a 6-hour 
downtime on all bitcoin deposits and internal bitcoin transfers in addition to the 
current pause on bitcoin withdrawals. Trading will otherwise still be open as 
Maintenance Schedule (approximate): "
6pm ~ 12am JST (February 15th)"
The above downtime period is approximate: it may be shortened or lengthened 
as required. Once the implementation is complete customers will again be able 
to deposit bitcoin, but we will be doing extensive testing before bitcoin 
withdrawals are reactivated. We will publish an update on the situation on 
Monday ."
BlockChain.info have implemented changes to address the malleability issue. 
Our solution should work in the short term, while a longer-term solution is being 
discussed with the Bitcoin Core Dev team and the Bitcoin Foundation. We are 
also discussing this with other exchanges and businesses. "
Thank you for your support during the maintenance, and we will update you on 
the progress shortly."
Best regards,"
MtGox Team"

please explain to me why you think that --- "Keynes Theory of government stimulating demand in economic down turns to maintain productivity and avoid depressions" is not even a properly formulated hypothesis.

Price does not equal value.
You might be willing to spend $100 on a pair of shoes, that have $0 value to the man with no feet. 
Just because price rises or falls the value has not changed. The value is determined by the usefulness of the good, not its price. Price can be reflective of value but value is not reflective of price. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:41:35
Economics is math, can one assume that there are then Economic Laws (absolutes like 1+1=2) even though yet to be defined ?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:23:31
MTGOX really lost 744,000 BTC wow --- ALL of that stolen inventory needs to clear, before a bottom can be established for the price of BTC.... wow

If nobody seems to understand me, how is it that JamboRambo was able to actually answer the question posed in the post ??
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:12:27
im not quite following your train of thought here, im sorry but, what do you mean bitcoin is not a currency then you say the currency is fiat. 
im sorry if im reading it wrong but I just don't understand what you mean, im confused by bitcoin not being a currency but the currency being fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:34:54
I am thinking of mining btc too, would you like to join my mining pool ??
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:43:07
The point is to take yourself out of the equation and look at the question objectively. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:57:24
So do you wish me to believe that not one person here can make a case for an economic law and how that will relate to the future of Bitcoin as a currency ?? I have more hope for mankind than you apparently =D
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:30:39
very well formed comment =) I commend you, , , so is it safe to surmise from your comment that you in fact have come to a conclusion that you realize an economic law, , , humans are apt to act like humans , , , fear and greed not altruism are the motivating forces of humans participating in an economy.
The paper boy problem is a fundamental problem that anyone with a choice of entering into One Whole Bitcoin purchase at any level must face.. .. how dose one justify parting with real money valued at XYZ purchasing power to acquire One Whole Bitcoin, when a paper boy "theoretically" is selling you that Bitcoin he traded his tip money for $1 in 2009 and then sat on the Bitcion - - - ? ? ? 
This goes back to the primary question, what is the value of Bitcoin in society, , , and when most of the computing power and energy in the Bitcoin system is being used to solve the block chain , there really is no benefit to society measurable in any form other than supply and demand for the Bitcoins themselves. . . It is non productive . .  . IF however the network were being used to host, process, or store then there would be an intrinsic value relative to the outside economy and draw revenue into the BTC economy from providing a marketable service. 
Hey thank you for having this conversation with me, I know I am not a good writer and it is difficult for me to put the thoughts in my head down in a comprehensible format to the reader, so I want you to know I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. Thank you
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:43:17
you could just as easily walk away from this thread, rather than continuing to jab with your hate speech 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:32:04
Im not here to make points (other than you are obviously _________) --- I am here to begin an exercise in critical thinking for the readers, these readers can then come to their own conclusions and share them here... ... ... You are free to abstain , , , in fact the thread might be better off without you --- thanks
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:27:04
the definition of currency is a "a :  circulation as a medium of exchange"
the fact that bitcoin acts as a vehicle in which wealth can be stored and/or transferred, in the facilitation of the exchange of goods and services, makes it a currency
this might even be considered an economic law :-) 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:37:36
BTC is worth the
Electricity used to process the block chain
The storage capacity of the eco system (at market rate)
good luck on the math
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:23:49
im speaking about economic law --- like if you spend your $1 bill for a can of soda, you no longer have the $1 --- if you drink the soda, you no longer have the $1 or the soda ---- if you throw away the can, you no longer have the $1, the soda, or the can --- This is absolute truth and can not be refuted. . . 
What I am trying to encourage with my post and the question within, is critical thinking on behalf of the reader, to determine what they see to be Economic Law and how it relates to Bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:19:51
I find it interesting that the first 3 people to respond to the post, , , obviously did not read the post. . . nor opine in kind - - - yet you geniuses are going to change the global economic system ... .... .... bwahahaha ... ... ... and become Zillionaires in the process LMFAO ---------
Any intelligent conversation from those who read my original post would be more than welcome 
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:15:20
hahaha good one !! hahaha 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:53:42
I have 1 word for you Ethereum :-)
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:08:03
thank you for your attempt to make what i said more palatable to the reader
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:13:05
If I were to edit the post to have no capital letters would that change the content of the message ?
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:23:22
you still have not joined the discussion 
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:54:41
Actually no, the paper boy risked losing 100% of his investment $2,000 but if the doctor wanted to by all the paper boys BTC in November 2013 and risk 100% of his investment it would be $5,000,000 
The likelihood of BTC going to $0,00 are the same for both investments, Loss of 100% is the same, but one loses $5,000,000 and the other $2,000 --- so, the "investor" who comes to the table late int the game has the MOST to lose and the least to gain (exactly opposite of the early investor) and this fundamental flaw will be key in why BTC will never be widely adopted.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:33:39
The various wonderful advantages presented by bitcoin are not in question, what I would like to focus on are the absolutes. 
Absolutes like 1+1=2 , infinite currency distribution crashed every economy that tried it , gravity pulls things toward the earth , etc 
I am interested to see what people conclude to be economic law, based on historical date, and how they think it might effect the future of Bitcoin. . . . 
Thanks for you post though 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:39:21
the mental process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:37:46
As stated in my original post Economic Laws have not been written, therefor I am posing the opportunity to the reader to objectively look at all of economic history (as if they were a martian) and share what they might consider to be economic law.... .... then relate it to the future of Bitcoin as a currency ----- 
I have no agenda other than a better understanding, reached through critical thinking, I look forward to seeing what conclusions people reach 
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:02:14
As a student of economics and investing .... everytime someone says "When you have something completely new, then the past no longer applies." you must run for the hills (especially if it has to do with investing) 
JDSU, Tulips, Housing Bubble, Dot Com Bubble, ect ect ect --- it's never "different this time" when you are still dealing with economics
How about you make a case for me as to why a Bitcoin will be valued at 1,000,000,000,000 US Dollars (other than the collapse of the US Dollar lol) and then explain to me how on earth anyone in 99% of the real world would be able to aquire one whole bitcoin (once all have been mined) ---- while reconsiling that a paperboy who bought 50 BTC for $50 in 2009 whould have 50 Billion US Dollars worth of purchasing power ? ? ? ? 
Being you are the most intelligent person I have discussed the Bitcoin topic with so far, I eagerly look forward to your response. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:03:36

I don't know to what you are referring 
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:26:18
BITCOIN is the technology of the future, but not the currency :-) 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:15:57
so the laws of physics are enforced by people with guns? your statement is erroneous 
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:33:34
no where in the laws does it mention "legal tender" 
the laws forbid "wagering" -- regardless of what is wagered 
BUT there is loop holes in the laws in the US that allow for LEGAL online poker playing, but rather than share that here I would start my own site then reveal the loop hole - hahaha 
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:57:26
in legal terms , poker played for bitcoin is not legal unless poker is legal (regardless of what is being wagered, wagering is the legal question not poker or bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:26:56
One "law" of economics is every time someone says "this time it will be different" it never is, , , my point with that statement is economics has laws - like gravity has laws,,,,, I would like the community here to identify those laws and opine as to how economic laws relate to the future of Bitcoin as a currency ---- the technology is not in question at the moment (just the currency)
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:05:46
you don't understand, BTC and BTC mtgox are 2 very different things at the moment. Options on any other exchange would be at the other exchange price $650. I only want the options on Mtgox BTC at $325 (when i posted this topic)
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:50:51
Stop drinking the Kool-Aide and make BTC actually work
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:12:25
I am not going to waste my time right now with you, enjoy your Kool-Aide, remember to stop and smell the tulips.
I will respond to you tomorrow
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:47:47
Really wish I had the time now to have this debate with you, but I don't.
You seem to have an interesting grasp on the subject so it might be nice to debate with you. If not tomorrow, definitely Sunday. 
I will even give you a little head start. What is to prevent all holders of BTC and miners from jumping out of BTC and into XYZ cryptocurrency, bringing the "price"/"value" down to absolute zero ?
I look forward to an intelligent debate 
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:01:13
it is my contention that there absolutely are economic laws (even if unwritten) just as there was gravity before Newton and the world was round prior to Magellan 
I know what I have identified as economic laws, but rather than try and impart my views onto others who would inevitably argue for the sake of arguing,,, I leave it to the reader to define their own economic laws based on their views of economic history =)
if your view of economic history leads you to believe there are no such thing as absolute economic laws , thank you for your participation but I doubt you will have any further interest in this thread
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:12:09
Let me know when will be good for you to have this chat :-) 
I will be busy Saturday but Sunday I'm game 
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:36:48
but this is CRAZY !! exchanges are meant to facilitate exchange not to HOLD DEPOSITS like "banks" , this in itself tells me the BTC community is not financially literate enough to know they are being fleeced.
NO WAY under the sun, would I ever give money to anyone and NOT have POSSESSION of the item I gave them the money for, waaaaaaaay too much risk there.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:23:23
the short answer is no. 
The long answer is think in terms of everything else, there is no one way of doing it. Coke, Pepsi - McDonalds, Burger King - Johnson and Johnson , Proctor and Gamble , etc , etc . 
Let's assume Bitcoin (the brand) is widely adopted, that does not mean it will be the best or sole digital currency system in play. In fact the only people "getting richer" from BTC are the ones who got in early and are reaping the rewards of the hype. 
The more successful BTC is, the more valuable it becomes for a competitor to step in and do it different (or better), so the idea that the long term, wide spread adoption of BTC by the world economy is basically a false premise (for BTC is a brand nothing more than a brand).
Is there upside in BTC from here -- yes.
Will BTC be the world reserve currency -- no
Does BTC increase the wealth of the world -- no (it does distribute wealth differently than the fiat system but not efficiently)
The example I use I call the Paper Boy Paradox:
A paper boy in 2009 could conceivably have heard of BTC and taken 50% of his weekly pay to purchase BTC. So lets say the paper boy made $80 per week for delivering news papers and bought $40 each week worth of BTC. At a price of $0.40 per BTC he would be acquiring 100 BTC per week. At the end of 2009, let's assume the paper boy has possession of 5,000 BTC. Then he gets hit by a bus while delivering his papers. 
IF he is dead the BTC is out of circulation forever, hence worthless. But let's assume he survives, but in a comma until November 2013, he logs into his BTC wallet to find that his 5,000 BTC are "worth" $5,000,000 US Dollars in purchasing power. How does one justify this paper boys purchasing power, in 5 years his purchasing power goes from $2,000 to $5,000,000? ? This makes not sense at all, he has brought no value to humanity, society, BTC community, yet because of the hype while in his comma - his 50 weeks of news paper delivering has afforded him the purchasing power of $5,000,000 ? ? How does one reconcile that with, the doctor who studied for 12 years and saved the life of the paper boy and over the same period of time amasses a purchasing power of $500,000 from practicing medicine for 5 years (after 12 years of school) ? ? 
In closing BTC won't be the digital currency adopted by the world, because it transfers all the wealth from the people who get on board late Directly to the people who got in early, for nothing more than having got in early. 
I hope this helps

Did you identify (what you might consider) an Economic Law and how that Economic Law relates to Bitcoin ?? 
Thanks for your post but did you answer the question posed ??
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:12:15
you seem to know A LOT about the process, 
what if you mine BTC and want the money right now ?? 
how do you go from mining, to getting btc, to selling btc, to "getting the money ?
thank you in advance

B. T, C, spells Kool-Aide but whatever
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:26:57
you guys are missing the point, options on the MTgox exchange would be based off of the BTC price of $330 when i made this original post. Any other exchange was quoting BTC above $600
I dont care about trading BTC options in general, I only wanted to take a hail marry on the Mtgox $330 price
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:05:34
even if unwritten there are laws in economics,
if you have $1 and you spend it on a can of soda -
you no longer have $1 -
if you drink the soda -
you no longer have $1 or the soda -
if you through away the can -
you no longer have the $1 or the soda or the can -
so I would contend the law to be, if you spend you
r wealth on consumables, once consumed your wealth is gone. obviously I use an extremely simple example but in the terms I have provided , would you refute what present to be an economic law ?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:23:25
oh yes i agree 100% the technology is earth shattering and I learn more about it every single day AMAZING !! --- and there is intrinsic value to all of the things bitcoin will be able to do relative to the market. . . but that does not exclude bitcoin from economic law . . . discounting the currency aspect of bitcoin makes it worth "BTC=the value of service it provides" ==== how would you determine the current value (not future value) of bitcoin, if you take away the currency aspect of it ??
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:05:30
Absolutely Mtgox is solvent, they are going to buy up as many BTC as they need to be solvent ---- and what better way to recapitalize the exchange than to take the price down 70% first

would you care to take a stab at the question posed ?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:06:59
im new to reddit but why do you insist on saying "what" so many times?
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:37:19
You are cherry picking to make an argument, by focusing on Newton rather than "the world is round" or "gravity existed before Newton" you have been able to attack theory rather than facts. . . I encourage you now to try and attack the facts, 1) the would is not flat 2) Gravity existed prior to being defined. . . 
If you chose not to address these facts, I will assume you agree that there is 'law' that exist beyond theory and can be correct and complete (along with useful)

Not one response to the actual question in the post, maybe if given a little time a fruitful conversation will develop. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:21:31
I think it is even simpler than that. Whatever group was running the male-ware that was capable of stealing the btc to begin with, they are panicking that they have a whole bunch of BTC that they can't move out of MTGOX. Rather than sit on their BTC (knowing how much they actually stole and that Gox might be insolvent) they are selling for whatever they can get, and withdrawing the real money. 
We can all have an opinion but the bottom line is this, as long as MTGOX remains solvent (easy to do with outside funds when BTC is sub $300) there is really nothing to worry about ---- AND THE BEST BUYING OPPORTUNITY YOU WILL EVER SEE, for you don't have to worry about the fate of BTC but the fate of MTGOX (and they will survive)
All it will take is one rich silicon valley dude (or group) who believe in BTC to BUY MtGox and "fix the glitch" and all of the BTC purchased there for sub $300 will shoot right back up to "market value" ---- once management at Gox is replaced.
I wish I had a gox account honestly, but I am new to the entire bitcoin realm.... But those of you who have accounts on Gox ----- ENJOY THE SALE !!!! 
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:59:24

@_date: 2014-02-12 06:29:56
very interesting thoughts, that is the first truly intelligent answer I have seen here. It is logical and well thought --- cheers --- 
Of course I will produce a counter point to this, given a little time to collect my thoughts. But off the cuff I would say, economic law is not man made and can not be "avoided" ---- 1+1=2 even in bitcoin
Economics is math, computing is math, Bitcoin is math and math has laws, so it is reasonable to say that Bitcoin will be subject to certain laws (not man made) as it can not avoid economic law
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:21:22
but why would your coins be locked in an online wallet by mtgox ?? I don't understand the value in the counter-party risk. . . They are supposed to facilitate "exchange". It is not exchange if they hold the BTC in their wallet.
Is this how all the BTC exchanges work ? That is an insane RISK, to have to rely on the individual exchange like that, what am i not understanding ?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:15:17
that is like saying "i think you are confusing mathematics with computing" 
math is everywhere and has rules, economics is not impervious to math, nor is bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:21:39
you are correct, it is very necessary to stop the theft, but what i don't understand (i am new to btc) is why can't the path of the BTC be tracked through the block chain and if it was stolen , it should be returned to the owner. 
Im having trouble understanding why this is so difficult
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:39:01
I am very interested in the fact that you mention Islamic theory, I have studied Islamic Economic Theory and if not for human greed I think it is the most equitable form of economic theories available to mankind thus far --- 
Unfortunately in practice it always fails, as the rich hoard the wealth rather than spread it back into circulation. . . look at all the Arab nations for proof of this
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:23:27
you don't need access to the financials to see what is going on, they tanked the price and are buying from the people freaking out and selling to mtgox for $350

is that the only way to spend the money though ?? I mean must it be transferred to a bank account or can you spend it right from your wallet ?? 
Not the BTC but the real money is what I mean

i have read the terms of bitfinex.com and I'm not comfortable with them at all. If you read carefully, there is no guarantee they can cover your gains, so basically you have unlimited loss potential and unknown gain potential.

I am having trouble understanding the concept of owning BTC and having it be worth $220 on MTGOX exchange..... that would signify to me that you don't actually own the BTC in your wallet....
what am I not understanding here??
When you buy stock, you literally own those shares. How is owning BTC not the same ?? I really am not understanding this whole MTGOX fiasco at all. please help me to better understand how BTC differs from stock ownership.
thank you
