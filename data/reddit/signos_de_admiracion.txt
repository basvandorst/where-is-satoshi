Segwit is basically a 1.7x blocksize increase. It's not a long term solution. It's an accounting hack to lower transaction fees without actually limiting bandwidth and storage requirements.

A hardware wallet isn't a magic bullet that solves all security problems. Look at the people who bought a Trezor that came with a seed and they actually used that seed and lost all of their coins.
You still need to have some basic security knowledge if you want to "be your own bank". If OP fell for a phishing attack they'd probably fall for other types of scams, too.

Besides centralization, LN adds the both a trust requirement and the ability to censor transactions to a network that was built to be trustless and censorship-proof.
When sending a transaction to an LN node you need to trust that it'll commit your transaction to the blockchain. A LN node could decide that it doesn't like the source or destination wallet address and just refuse to process the transaction.
Compare that to vanilla bitcoin where no single node can reject a valid transaction and if a single node goes away your transaction is still processed by the other nodes.
I get that it's great for scalability, but it removes two fundamental properties from Bitcoin. I really have no problem with it though because it's not required. Bitcoin still works like Bitcoin and nobody is required to use LN.

Structuring is when you make cash deposits under $10k to avoid AML laws.
You can make bank-to-bank transfers or deposit checks under $10k all day long and they don't care. When you transfer between bank accounts, they can trace the money. They can't do that with cash. That's why banks need to ask you where you got the cash from and report large deposits (over $10k).

There is no official roadmap for bitcoin. It's a decentralized project. From the sidebar:

So you might be able to find different teams of people working on features they'd like to integrate into the bitcoin network, but they're not "official" and they likely won't commit to any timeframe publicly until their software has been heavily tested and is ready to launch.

From the article:


And based on [this blog post]( that provider is BitPay.
Now remember that BitPay was going to [stop processing payments under $100]( in December before [backpedaling two days later](
Maybe they started pulling the plug on Bitcoin payments when Bitpay first told them about the new minimum, then were pissed off when Bitpay bailed on that two days after the public announcement.
It's hard to say exactly what happened, but there's a 100% chance it was related to BitPay since Microsoft's reason for re-instating bitcoin is that they "worked with their provider" to allow lower bitcoin amounts.

I don't get the Brian Armstrong hate. He owes no allegiance towards Bitcoin. The fact that he owns more ETH than BTC doesn't make him corrupt. In fact, none of the things in [this dumb list]( makes him corrupt.
Plus he managed to leave out people who are actually corrupt like John McAfee and Kim Dotcom. And the people who shilled Bitconnect.
There are people out there causing actual harm in the cryptocurrency space and this dude is focusing his attention on a guy that makes it possible for millions of people to buy, sell, send, and receive BTC, ETH, and LTC? A guy who's company allows merchants to accept BTC in their stores?

The headline is bullshit because the analyst didn't say that. The actual quote was that they wouldn't be surprised if it hit $100k. That's a lot different than predicting it'll hit $100k.

That's a bit underwhelming considering you could get the same experience by setting up a bitcoin client on the testnet and buying a fake coffee with zero or one confirmation transaction. You don't need to wait for a block to be mined that includes your transaction, which is effectively what lightning is doing.
I'm sure it'll be great when it's running live and you can actually use it and it's faster than regular transactions, but this demo doesn't prove that lightning is better, only that it works.

Yeah and she's also been wrong before. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Also she's not predicting $100k bitcoin, she said that she "wouldn't be surprised" if it peaked at $50k-100k this year.

If you write a lightning app, that app needs to run somewhere. Someone needs to own and pay for the servers it runs on. Besides a server to run the app, the app developer might need to run their own dedicated lightning node. If the servers or nodes go away, the app stops working.
Compare that to a dapp, where once it's published it could in theory go on forever because it doesn't require anyone to run that specific app. The app runs as a smart contract on a distributed virtual machine.

Sorry, but the petition is dumb. Why would Coinbase management even bother looking at it? Why is the opinion of 600 random people important to them?
Your efforts would be better focused on having actual Coinbase account holders file a support ticket with the request. That's something that they actually track even if you think their support is bad. Brian Armstrong even said that SegWit wasn't one of the major features requested by customers. How does he know this? Because he knows what people ask them for, he's not basing the decision on reading reddit or random online petitions.

Why? You either support an organization and their cause or you don't. If you are promising to give them money monthly/yearly in exchange for "reports" on how they spend it, that gives you influence on how they spend it. But they're the experts on the cause, not you.
If you're worried that an org is going to spend money poorly, then don't give them money. Or you could try saying "here's a bunch of money but you can only spend it on this one thing" and they may or may not accept it.
Either way, if you really want to influence how an organization spends their money, join it and work on getting elected to the board of directors.

I think advertisements like this from people who contribute to the community are fine. If you look at OP's post/comment history, most of their comments are helping people get their own stores set up to accept BTC/LN payments.

You are truly naive if you believe that. In the Ross Ulbricht case, the police grabbed him before he could lock his laptop and they had access to his unprotected wallet and were able to immediately transfer the bitcoin out.
If you read the article, it says the police were able to seize £500k worth of bitcoin but he still had around £1.5m unaccounted for that they couldn't seize. There are tons of ways they could have got that £500k, like an accessible wallet on his phone. Or an account at an exchange that they were able to issue a warrant for.
Besides being able to seize the bitcoin, a judge could order someone to pay it back. At that point, they might as well have seized it since they'll get the money back eventually. If the perp claims they have no money, a prosecutor would simply have to catch them spending money to prove they do and then hold them in jail in contempt.
If the government knows you have bitcoin and they want it, they will be able to get it either through seizure or threat of prison. What's the point of holding on to a few million worth of BTC if you can't actually use it? 
I don't know about you, but I'd rather be poor and free than "rich" but unable to spend my money without constantly being on the run from the law.

You realize land can be seized too, right? Stocks can be come worthless. OP's title gives an example of metals being seized.
And if you don't think bitcoin can be seized, look at the Ross Ulbricht case or any of the others where the government got their hands on someone else's bitcoin.
Obviously it's good to diversify your holdings into different asset classes, but if you do something to piss off the government/society, they can take everything you have. There is no class of asset that's safe from government seizure if they can prove that you have it.

That's a really shitty argument though. It's the same argument people use to defend ponzi/pyramid schemes. "If more people get in, it'll be worth more!"
It's a given that if more people are interested then it will become more valuable. Why not focus on how or why people would be more interested? What is the catalyst that you see causing 1/10 of the world to "get a little skin in the game"?

The barrier to entry is a required amount of intelligence and ambition. If you want to get into tech simply to make money but otherwise aren't interested and have no natural aptitude, you won't make it very far.
But if you are generally smart and passionate, you'll find there are very few barriers in your way to becoming successful.
I was a hiring manager for software engineers for most of the past 3 years and I've reviewed thousands of resumes, phone screened a few hundred people, and interviewed about a hundred in person. We hired 5 of them. I don't think we were incredibly picky, it's just that most people we interviewed were fucking losers.
I'd say that 50% of the people I talked to who listed C/C++ on their resume couldn't write a for() loop to count to 10. 50% of the people with Java couldn't write a class definition with a couple of empty methods. It was rare to get to the point where we actually asked CS questions because it was clear that they didn't know half the stuff on their resume.
So yeah, I agree that there is a constant flood of people. But most of them suck.
But to keep with the topic of the thread, 2 of the 5 we hired were women even though they made up only 5% of the interview pool. How'd that happen? Because we discriminated? Was there a quota? No, it's that the women who applied tended to be far better applicants than the men. Their actual experience and knowledge matched what was on their resume. I got the feeling that the women wouldn't apply unless they thought they were actually qualified, where many men just blast their resumes out hoping they'll slip through the cracks and get hired accidentally.
When it came down to actually getting a good candidate in an interview who really knew their shit, there was a nearly even split between men and women. There were way more men who were straight up badass coders, but that's more of a minimum requirement than the complete package we were looking for. A big chunk of the badass coder bros were basically robots and weren't very well rounded. People like that suck to work with so we didn't tend to hire them.

The number of bitcoins in existence (UTXO set) and the number of bitcoins that have been mined are two different values.
It's true that 17M bitcoins have been mined. It's not true that there are 17M bitcoins in the UTXO set (meaning: bitcoin that can be spent, or "bitcoins that exist", or "bitcoin supply") because of the reasons  pointed to.

Not sure how. If someone pays you in bitcoin, they likely have to buy the bitcoin themselves.
Maybe asking to be paid in BTC will help normalize it and maybe get more people to buy and hold for payments? If nothing else it'll increase the transaction rate because someone has to buy BTC and then transfer it to you.
