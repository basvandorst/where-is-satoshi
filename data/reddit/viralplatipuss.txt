Yeah I'm hoping when support get back to me, they can file a report. They'll have more info available to them than me.

Although there does seem to be a psychological barrier when people hear how much "one coin" is worth. I wonder if the Japanese suffer the same barrier when converting yen into US dollars during a trip to the US.
The trend of using the term mBTC (which, by the way, is currently about $1!) is taking off and hopefully might be easier for people to deal with when thinking about bitcoins.

Good idea. Although you could just upload the invoice to the site using their functionality to do so.
As for recourse, the transactions and trades are all logged on the site. So there's evidence for a dispute.

It was a brand new account with 0 feedback and he/she has since deleted it.
If the same user were to attempt to scam again, they'd create a new account.

Check out LocalBitcoins.com
That's where I got mine. Quick UK bank transfers with escrow for safety.
The values are slightly higher than MtGox typically, but then again you could sell there for higher too. It all sort of works out.
Quickest way into BTC either way if you're UK based.

I haven't used it but considered it too before going with LocalBitcoins.
The prices are higher and at the time I was on, there were only a couple users actively selling. I can't see a single user rating at 100% either. Maybe that works differently but most seem around 80-90%.
On Localbitcoins there seem to be more people and the only ones I see selling all have 100% ratings.

There's a post on r/bitcoin right now about meeting at your bank and borrowing a meeting room. Which means you could pay the cash in then and there.

You're saying $1 million valued bitcoins (21 million coins in total) is ridiculous.
So instead you suggest $1 bitcoins. Then after agreeing that 21 million $1 coins in circulation, forming a market cap of $21 million is too small, you're ultimately suggesting that the number of coins should be increased.
If it was increased so the market cap was now $2 trillion again, then value-wise, nothing has changed. Sure, now 1 BTC = $1, but there's also a load more of them. The change is pure semantics (assuming when this change happened, every owner of bitcoin gets their current value in the new denomination).
I know you said you believe a $2 trillion market cap is too high for bitcoin, in which case your point should be that 1 bitcoin isn't worth $1 million. Not that there need to be a load more bitcoin, each valued at $1.  Bitcoin can be broken down into smaller fractions, including $1 amounts. You don't need to buy and use a whole number of bitcoins for it to work as a currency.
