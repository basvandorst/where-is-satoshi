I am buying more miners right now... if I hadn't committed funds to that, I would likely be putting in buy orders.
I think it could touch 7.5K before the rebound.

True.. subject to VERY STRICT RULES and prior approval and work entirely different than credit cards.
with most brokerages, you are not allowed to cover a margin call by selling stock, you HAVE TO provide NEW CASH or else you lose the right to trade on margin in the future!

That's called a CASH ADVANCE and is subject to a completely different set of rules and limits by the card company.
I have a card with a 28K spending limit and 1K cash advance limit.  Also, the cash advance incurs interest INSTANTLY.

Dear god.. you really should follow the link before exploding.
You know something else you can't buy with credit cards.. MONEY ORDERS.
The point is that credit cards are set up to allow you to buy PRODUCTS, not investments or currencies, or however you want to classify Bitcoin.  FYI.. it DOES behave like a stock right now.
Go to a currency exchange location anywhere in the world and see how far your CREDIT CARD will get you.. not very.  IF they allow it (and most don't) You will be subject to the credit card companies cash advance restrictions, likely allowing you to get very little cash AND subjecting you to fees PLUS interest from the moment you make the cash advance.
However, people were using credit cards to buy Bitcoin like a product, thereby skirting all the restrictions.
I'm glad they did this, people shouldn't be using credit cards to buy BTC, it should be purchased the way any other currency is purchased, with a different form of cash.

I've made claims with items purchased with my debit card and gotten my money back.
Fraud is fraud.

Casinos are not allowed to sell you chips via a credit card.  ONLY for cash.  So you can go to an ATM, take money out and buy chips, or you can wire transfer money to the casino to buy chips.. BUT, if a casino allows you to use your CREDIT CARD to buy chips, that is against the law in everyplace I know of.

Yes and no.
If you want to buy a PRODUCT (1 oz of gold), yes, you can, you can buy and X-box as well.
However, if you want to buy gold futures, a gold index fund any of the other ways MOST people buy gold, the answer is no.

Some stocks do... depends on the stocks.  I recently had one go from 6 to 30 in an afternoon.. it has since settled at 18.

Not in most places.  You can only buy currency with cash/cash equivalent (debit card).
IF you try to buy with a credit card, it is treated as a CASH ADVANCE, which credit cards have major restrictions on. (much lower limits, interest accruing from the moment of purchase, etc..).

There is a ton of "that" money in everything.

I am not quite sure why, but it seems like that  A LOT of people think this is some type of negative BTC post.
It's not.  It's actually exactly the opposite.  Not allowing credit card purchases of BTC is a step in the RIGHT DIRECTION towards BTC being seen in a proper light.
You could buy all the beanie babies you wanted with credit cards.. but you can't buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, MONEY ORDERS or many other things b/c it is considering skirting the cash advance rules.
I don't care about the motivation of the companies, if their goal is FUD, whatever, however, no one would ever take BTC seriously it can continue to be bought the same way people bought furbies!

Racking up credit cards without the absolute means to pay for it is the stupidest thing you can do financially.  
Buying ANY investment with credit cards isn't smart.  When I bought my mining equipment I did it with money I had saved for investment purposes.
You know something else you can't buy with credit cards?  MONEY ORDERS.. and they literally pay for themselves.
This is why this should be a non-issue, but instead caused a panic.

I should have said products/services.
Not really so much for cash advances, as, if you read your credit card agreement, you will find is EXTREMELY limited.
Not only is it likely subject to a completely different limit, but the interest on it is different.  
Below is a cut and paste from one of my cards.
APR for purchases 8.99%(V) APR for cash advances 21.24%(V)
and another:
APR for purchases 9.9%(V) APR for cash advances 23.24%(V)
Discover card has a whole FAQ on the subject.  
It is a separate credit line, subject to a different APR and set of rules.
I am shocked it took credit card companies THIS LONG to wake up to the concept that people were using credit to buy BTC.

Probably at the moment because it is the "thing".. but in the long run, it will all settle out.
