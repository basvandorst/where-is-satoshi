How is this a problem with bitcoin or its community? The item being ransomed here is information, not bitcoin. They could have hijacked the exact same info and asked for Canadian dollars to be wired somewhere or dropped in cash at a location they deemed fit to collect

Fair point. I should have acknowledged that in my comment

Fantastic resource for keeping your head straight during the dips

If you can afford it, yes. So very much yes. But you've got to be in it for the long game. Short term can always loom disheartening. Just keep buying all the way down and smile all the way up

It may just be the aspergers talking here but... you had 10 fucking groomsmen?!?!

OP... be extra careful of scammers like this ☝️☝️
Anyone pushing to talk to you "privately" and making grand "guaranteed" claims is looking to separate you from your money

Whatever you feel you can afford to lose (this should be the answer for literally ANY investment). The good news for you is that at your age you dont have too many responsibilities on your plate yet. What is going to be hardest is playing the true long game and not tapping into it when you need an easy way out of a stressful financial situation in the next few years. Good luck and happy hodling

You said there were no discernable use cases over credit cards so I provided you a very recent and important one over credit cards. I didn't know checks fell into the credit cards category but we can talk about those too I guess... Should I go into the specific advantages of btc over just checks then? Or does it need to be an advantage over both checks and credit cards for you to count it? Are you saying that because checks have a 0% fee attached to them that credit cards are also snake oil like the evil bitcoin? Or is that just a disadvantage of the credit card and bitcoin systems when compared to a check? I mean that's kinda the point of different payment systems isn't it? That they have different advantages and disadvantages?

So are credit card fees being 2.5x higher not a "discernable use case" or are businesses that pay taxes "fringe groups"?

Dude... you're making it real tough to have a genuine conversation at this point. If I was making that claim then your sarcasm would be clearly warranted here because that's ridiculous. But you actually made the equally ridiculous claim that there was "NOT A SINGLE USE CASE FOR BTC OVER CREDIT CARDS". I showed you a single specific case in response to that and you act as if I'm telling you that response is enough to make it take over the US dollar. All I am trying to show you is that btc does have advantages whether you choose to ignore them or not. 
And yes my username is excruciatingly relevant here. It should bother you that you have more problems following a simple concept than a retard like myself
