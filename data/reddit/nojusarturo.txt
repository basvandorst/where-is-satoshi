i was here during the dark days
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:09:20
I'm all in crypto.... DO IT!
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:20:02
If you're willing to risk 20k then sure.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:21:51
Looks like he got some sun.
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:30:42
I'm sick of the politics in this state.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:29:18
I bought some at 800+ and do still hold them.  I refuse to sell for fiat, if it looks like bitcoin isn't progressing then I'll just spend the coins.  I have not seen any reason to think that bitcoin is done growing so I'll hold.
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:17:58
I'm Lithuanian and this is embarrassing.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:42:40
Fuck these stupid spy gadgets.

If you're a company and you want to serve your consumers best and want them to keep coming back to you, then you don't want to piss them off by putting the risk on them.  Overstock will make more money by taking on the risk when it makes mistakes.

I'm a fan of this dude.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:04:36
It needs to be more accessible at the moment,  as soon as I don't have to jump through hoops to install it, I'm on board.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:36:11
Does this guy even know anything?
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:44:55
I have put a portion of my savings into bitcoin to hedge against inflation, it's not a bad idea if you believe bitcoin is going up long term.  The price has stabilized a lot in the past weeks as well.  If you invest more than you can afford to lose however I think that you're just asking for something bad to happen.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:11:42
Dang that's an ugly sweater.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:56:21
EVERYONE MOVE TO DENMARK
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:58:20
He's a troll.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:00:14
I tweeted a request to guest Andreas Antonopoulos on the Joe Rogan Experience to him, other bitcoiners should do the same.
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:25:26
This is insane, and I'm definitely going to be using this feature as soon as I get familiar with FrostWire.  This is huge for artists like myself.
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:57:15
No way...
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:18:24
I bought some at 1k, it went up to 1.2k and I was happy, then it crashed and just bought more.  Next time it goes up to 1.2k I'll be super happy again, we just need that first real big player to invest in the market.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:01:09
Sweet, I heard about the meet up and Andreas was there, didn't go but now that I know of a business that accepts and keeps bitcoin, I'm definitely gonna go there.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:22:47
There is no advantage that Apple Mobile Payment System has over Bitcoin and Bitcoin is already somewhat established.  This will most likely fail.
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:11:11
you kidding? That 49ers Seahawks game is gonna be a classic for years to come.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:10:28
Of course it's a unit of account. And price volatility is going down, and it's still a tiny market.
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:08:56
This article seems to be reaching for negativity.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:54:41
me too
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:50:03
Ugh I remember when I bought in at this price too it was really frustrating, what helped most was buying a little every now and then at different prices
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:45:10
Stratis, Wings, Golem, Lumen, Komodo, Waves I would keep. the rest i would sell for OMG and NEO since you can also get return on investment right away with NEO claiming gas just by having it in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:48:42
Just buy a little at a time.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:42:32
If you got NEO and OMG then you did well.
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:31:14
Circle is trash
@_date: 2016-11-18 05:22:21
Not surprised.
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:50:58
Funny how they wait 2 years for the price to rise so they can investigate the gains. Where was all this interest in our info when the price was low?
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:35:50
That's not what I'm asking
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:35:30
Psh my whole savings is in btc
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:34:15
What if there are no records
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:45:15
That's not a lot I thought it'd be more
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:36:57
How to stop the decline - YOU DONT
This is just a market cycle and ppl buying are just delaying us hitting bottom. We need to hit bottom and reverse otherwise it's going to just bleed.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:35:26
Or the other two people...
@_date: 2016-09-17 19:52:25
This is so legit.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:36:44
Not to mention he was the cause of the drop from the bull trap.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:54:20
Sounds like someone needs to move into alts.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:38:58
instead of gambling on crypto, concede defeat to the chains of fiat, got it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:47:34
Barry Silbert
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:57:10
Buy more.
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:12:18
Didn't help
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:39:18
The fuck does manicheist mean
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:08:09
Lmao forced hodl 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:29:52
I refuse to go under a whole Bitcoin and that's that.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:36:04
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:45:21
Smart man
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:18:36
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:26:42
Also not to mention raising the fees ridiculously high 
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:32:27
Everything I hear from that side is political trash.  I don't even have an opinion on the debate.  I don't claim to know what bitcoin should do with the block size and scaling.  The whole podcast I listened to sounded like a cult gathering.
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:28:21
It's bad
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:57:40
I love hodling 
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:22:51
Lol wat
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:11:25
You should have been hodling for years now it's too late to buy
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:01:06
Yeah Alts are amazing and will be a huge part of why crypto changing the world.  Alts need bitcoin, but bitcoin needs alts and neither of them have any choice in whether the other exists or not so it would make sense for them to work together.
@_date: 2017-07-15 03:16:03
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:32:40
Why is Litecoin a "threat"? Why don't you own both?
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:24:24
For the party on the moon?
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:48:57
I hate your fees tho
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:00:34

Hey dude u do Jiu Jitsu?

Coinbase has been the best exchange so far in my opinion and I'm not gonna jump ship, but they do need to do better.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:13:50
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:12:52
I need to get my residency established over there just a little
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:55:44
This is why exchanges suck from now on I'm doing local
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:29:04
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:12:22
I do it but not often.
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:25:59
If Risk the board game says it's a continent then it's a continent
@_date: 2016-07-12 06:12:51
Just easier with cash
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:40:47
They can manipulate the price then pretty much
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:12:46
What did he do that was illegal? Sell his property?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:41:36
Even though losing China sucks, it doesn't take us back in time.  BTC has grown GLOBALLY since China came in.  We may no longer have them pumping the value up, but present day BTC without China is way bigger than it was when they entered.  This isn't to say the price won't be lower in all circumstances, but BTC doesn't go back in time.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:39:57
Bitcoin is global.  That's the biggest hurdle that governments have in killing bitcoin.  Most of the world's population still would benefit from adopting Bitcoin.  Remember, the price of Bitcoin is not actually that important.  Once it's accepted where it's most in demand, it would be to America's detriment to try to ban it.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:05:42
"Bitcoin represents the reconstitution of a hierarchal system that directs wealth into the hands of a small elite — and maintains the oppression of the masses."
So if this is a bad thing then that makes fiat better than bitcoin? Let's also forget that she doesn't have any proof for any claims.
