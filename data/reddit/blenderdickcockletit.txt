LN doesn't work and BLockstream knows it. It was just bumped from a L2 scaling solution to L3 because it has so many problems.

I'm not looking for an argument, I'm looking for an explanation and you have yet to provide one.
I am legitimately curious why this idea that bigger blocks is going to centralize Bitcoin because you're not the only one that I've seen saying that same thing around here. 
If the claim has any root in reality I am here to be educated. If it doesn't then I would ask why the fuck anyone would spread such lies unless they're either pushing an agenda or have been conned into being a foot soldier for said agenda pushers. 
This is not a matter of opinion. This is technology, science, and math and should be based only on facts.

Does nobody remember how the miners nearly unanimously agreed to Segwit as long as the block size were increased along with it? 
Now that Blockstream and Core have Segwit they fucked the miners by fighting the expected block size increase and causing a huge rift in the community.
BCH wouldn't have even been a blip on the radar if Core wasn't pushing so many people out. 
You want centralization? Hand the reins over to a dev team of 16 people who are on the payroll of a company that has a conflict of interest with on-chain solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:03:26
Is it possible that Core and Blockstream supporters could be creating need for their second and third layer "solutions" by rejecting bigger blocks? 
Being that there is no proof of anything, and even if the transactions are fraudulent(they're not), almost every side of this debate has incentive to spam the BTC network.

This is legal speak for "you're allowed to use it as long as we agree with what you do with it."
If you think that they wouldn't go after a competing company or development team that used something they believe they've patented, you're naive as fuck.
Blockstream's lead investor is AXA, a Multinational investment company and primary shareholder of Blockstream. They invested in Blockstream's "innovation" and if Blockstream allowed bigger blocks, it would reduce need for their side-chain technology and go against their business model. 
Blockstream is the exact same type of company that Bitcoin was developed to avoid. They are beholden to shareholder expectations and profit. In other words, you and people like you have let Bitcoin be taken over entirely by corporate interests. Congratulations.

I will not download that malware to my computer because it serves no function and I do not trust the people that created it. 
LN will not be live in 2018, I guarantee. You know why? In order to use it you have to run TWO transactions through the backlogged mempool.
"Further optimisation" is just a euphemism for needing a layer in between so that channels can be settled off chain. It's, yet again, talking about a "trustless" system that promises the world but is fraught with the same problems that LN has.. 
There's no logical reason that Bitcoin can't have larger blocks while these L2 and L3 "scaling solutions" are developed. There is no useable product, there is no timeline, and therefore there is no solution. 
What Blockstream has done is prevent a block size increase in order to create a need for their product from which they can collect fees. If the mempool weren't backlogged, there would be no need to scale. Blockstream is attacking Bitcoin from the inside and you guys can't see it because they've convinced you that the miners are the evil ones. If they cared about Bitcoin as a technology, they would allow it to scale as intended and develop their product on a level playing field.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:29:09
You need to realize that bigger blocks are not a long term solution in anyone's book, even the developers of BCH. However, the BCH community isn't afraid of increasing block size in order to handle demand in the meantime. while logical solutions are developed.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:15:27
Nice to see some sense being discussed here. 
I don't know if Blockstream owns a patent on LN specifically but they do have a patent on "side chain technology". People keep trying to cite Blockstream's "statement" about their patent which says that it's free to use **as long as it's within the confines of Blockstream's vision** which means it's NOT free to use. 
The best philosophy with stuff like this is to assume the worst and hope for the best and, based on Blockstream and Core's behaviour lately, I think assuming the worst is the best way to go. 
If they really wanted to "preserve" side chain technology and keep it from being patented by a nefarious company then they would make their patent public instead of limiting progression with the constraints of whatever vision they have that day.
Also, LN has been pushed to Layer 3 now and likely delayed even further. So this congestion is not going to subside any time soon. The damage they've done to Bitcoin is unfathomable. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:30:13
"The miners" are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing by mining the most profitable chain.
The problem is that Bitcoin Core blocks are full. Do you know why they're full? Because they're too small. Even if blocks were being found on schedule the backlog would take days to clear. 
The only good thing about small blocks right now is that people can't pull their money out as fast as they want so it's slowing down the mass exodus from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Cash. 
Open source does not mean open access or open discussion. it simply means that the source code is available to the public. Who makes the decisions for Core? Who is actually allowed to contribute to the project? Who makes the decisions for Blockstream? Have you ever asked yourself why Core and Blockstream want smaller blocks and off chain scaling? It might be because Blockstream pays the Core team and it might also be because Blockstream *actually owns a patent on side chain technology*. 
So not only do you continue to blame the miners for Core's failure, you also don't understand what open source means while projecting on me by calling me a troll. I hope you've sold your Bitcoin Core, it's going to have a bad year. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:52:40
Regardless of the current bitcoin fee cost, instead of replying to his post with anything about Bitcoin Core like a solution or plan you just point the finger at "the miners". It's always someone else's fault in this sub. What exactly is centralized about Bitcoin Cash? It's a 100% trustless P2P digital currency that has several development teams working on it and a community that supports their decisions unanimously through constructive discussion and problem solving. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin Core is controlled by one development team and one company who are creating an artificial need for their product. Which, I should mention, is not remotely ready for deployment and was just delayed yet again. 
The only reason the backlog might be temporary is because once everyone pulls their funds out and the price crashes, nobody will want to use it any more.

Just because a comment is gilded doesn't mean it's truthful or even useful. Lightning has been moved to L3 because it doesn't work. Right now it's a prototype and not even a minimum viable product. As-is, it only exists on a testnet within a tightly controlled environment and has no real-world application. 
Easiest example to use as to why it's useless is that in order to use LN you have to first do an on chain transaction and then to close the channel you have to do another one. Instead of solving backlog problems, it actually would increase the number of on chain transactions. 
I say this while the mempool has over 100k backlogged transactions.

[Here ya go.]( It's a 1TB computer for about $370 bucks. 
The current blockchain is about [140 GB]( total. So that computer should give you another few years before you need to upgrade the hard drive. Maybe by then the Blockstream layer 2 and layer 3 "solutions" will be ready and you won't need to worry about it but I'm not holding my breath. 
I'm wondering how cheap memory will be in 2 or 3 years. I should also admit that this is the first computer I found on the Best Buy website, if I spent some real time I could probably find something with a bigger HDD for less than $200.

Nobody in r/btc attacks r/bitcoin users. Generally dissent and discussion is welcome over there. The problem is the trolls and shills that make claims that bigger blocks will somehow centralize Bitcoin while Core and Blockstream move in and take over while you guys are complaining about us. r/btc users see it plain as day and just can't understand how you would let them take control of BTC in such a way. 
Meanwhile, now that 2X has been called off, Blockstream immediately announces that LN is no longer a L2 scaling solution (LOL) and they've proposed some other bizarre middle-man bullshit in its place and moves it to L3... and they still haven't even released a minimum viable product!
Their whole defense was saying that bigger blocks will centralize and the decision for 2X was made too fast and to give them time for LN to activate and lo-and-behold, 2 days later it gets delayed yet again and this time with promise of additional vaporware in the middle. 
BCH is a much better investment in the long run because it has a community with critical thinking skills who takes information at face value instead of believing propaganda and promises that never come.
If you want a decentralized trustless means of exchange, BCH fits the bill. If you want to hand your future over to a single company that's made promises for years and never delivered, that's your prerogative.

You are aware that LN has been moved to Layer 3 and a new product is being invented to fill the L2 space, right? 
Even if LN isn't technically classified as a side chain tech, the legal system lacks the knowledge to properly defend any accusations that Blockstream might bring toward a company that tries to compete with them. They now have the money and power they need to file lawsuits whenever/wherever they want. The patent they got is so generic and vague that they were basically handed the keys to the kingdom.

How can it be attacked? It's a free market. A lot of people recognize problems with the current state of Blockstream Coin and chose to compete directly against it. 
Does WalMart say that a Costco opening up across the street is an attack? No, it's competition. With the amount of money in cryptos now, competition is going to be everywhere at all times. 
If Blockstream and Core want their coin to survive they better start learning how to compete with a better product instead of just complaining about competition and erroneously labeling it as an attack.

Redditor for 2 days.
So bigger blocks somehow "centralize" bitcoin while a single company and a dev team on their payroll deny scaling solutions and make promises that are years away is somehow not a centralization effort. 
You recommend against Bitcoin Cash why exactly? Because it works? Because it's not overtaken by a company that owns a patent on sidechain technology who fights against bigger blocks in order to create a need for its product? 
Look it up. Blockstream has a patent on "side-chain technology". You think they would allow Bitcoin to have bigger blocks? Of course not, because it goes against their business model. 
Wake the fuck up. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:49:30
Bigger blocks are the simplest and most immediate solution and provide breathing room and a level playing field for development teams to propose solutions. This is not a new concept, it has literally been *the only scaling solution for 8 years*.
Transactions records take storage space, this is a fact today and it was a fact 30 years ago with paper records. 
The average computer bought for less than $500 today can handle 10X the size of the Bitcoin blockchain easily. Storage technology moves faster than the Bitcoin blockchain record. 
I don't have to prove I'm not a shill because I bring facts and reason to the argument while you bring the same regurgitated bullshit that's been spewed by Core and Blockstream for the past year while they work to create a need for their side chain technology patents.

BCH supporters do not believe that bigger blocks are a long-term solution. The block size increase is a maintenance solution while L2 services are developed. They would rather not have a crippled, impossible-to-use currency in the meantime.
What I find particularly interesting is how the miners are vilified on this subreddit but then when it comes to scaling solutions the replies are "think of the miners!!!".
Also I HOPE YOU KNOW that people running independent nodes don't have to save the entire block chain. I also HOPE YOU KNOW that the block size doesn't even need to *have* a limit and didn't have one during the initial development of Bitcoin. I also HOPE YOU KNOW that even if the block size limit were 100gb, if only 1mb of transactions were on  a block it would only take up, you know, about 1mb of space. 
IF the L2 scaling solutions WORKED, you would see a gradual decrease in the block sizes regardless of whatever the block size limit is at that point.

"Industry" is the operative word. Industry suggests companies that are seeking profit as companies do. When you have a decentralized product and an individual entity that's gained control of it in in place, profit is the name of the game.
Block stream artificially limits block size increases because it has patents on side chain technology. This is not an exaggeration, they literally obtained a patent. Guess what Lightning Network is; sidechain technology. If blocks were bigger, there would be no immediate need for LN and thus they'd be going against their business model to allow it. 
Can you show me an industry that sacrifices profits in order to support the greater good or is it overwhelmingly common that companies go for maximum profitability first and altruistic endeavours second(or last).
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:44:54
The internet is not a [series of tubes]( Seriously stop with the bullshit analogies. 
The BTC blockchain is a SINGLE pipeline. There are no branches. There are no bends. Transactions go in one end and out the other and the destination of the transaction does not matter. 
Increasing the pipeline size increases the volume that can be pushed through it. There is NO UPPER LIMIT. There is NO DIMINISHING RETURNS. It is LINEAR PROGRESSION. More space = More transactions. Period.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:00:30


So wait a minute, you're telling me it's the miner's fault because they refused to run a change? If they refuse to run it, obviously there is no consensus. Do you understand the meaning of the word?
You know why segwit was added? Not to directly scale Bitcoin but to add a vehicle with which Blockstream and Core could implement some kind of L2 side chain instead of a block size increase. You know why? because Blockstream has a patent on side chains. That's fact, look it up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:13:01
As I said, it's a free market. It's unregulated and nobody has a patent or ownership of Blockchain Coin or Bitcoin Cash therefore there's nothing stopping 20 new forks from happening and all of them using similar names and logos. 
Costco using WalMart's name, logos, etc is actually illegal because they exist in a regulated space and Costco would be sued instantly.
So because of that, Costco has to compete more directly by providing better service and cheaper prices. My point is that Blockstream and Core could do that with their coin if they wanted but they're choosing not to. Instead they run smear campaigns and propaganda while they literally do nothing to improve their product.

Also, "custodial Wallets" aren't going to provide their service for free. In fact, I would be MORE SKEPTICAL if their service was particularly cheap or free. Perhaps fees would be reduced from on-chain transactions but now you're paying money to a bank, not to the network.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:22:17
Yes,  you are.
A channel can only be opened between 2 entities with LN installed. If you open a channel with your local Starbucks, it will ONLY work at Starbucks. In theory, that channel could be open forever, but not in practice. Starbucks has bills to pay and will need to close the channel regularly in order to settle their accounts. When they close the channel, it will require another on-chain transaction and another fee. 
If you want to buy from them again, you need to open another channel, requiring another on-chain transaction, and pay another fee.

Be smart, do their own research and make the decision for themselves. I don't instruct people to "HODL" or buy BCH or anything because I am not a prophet. My holdings are my own and I keep/trade them at my own discretion. 
The countless posts of HODL and whatever other bullshit is just going to usher in a new generation of Bagholders because Bitcoin Core is nothing but a speculation tool at this point. It has no underlying value and it doesn't work. The record high mempool is a good example of what I'm talking about. 
But go ahead, wait for the mystery L2 scaling solution to go live that just got announced a couple days ago. Lightning Network has now been moved to L3 because it doesn't work as L2. How many layers do you think they'll need to add in order to make it work? Time will tell, but in the meantime, blocks will be congested and support will falter. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:03:50


This whole argument has come down to smear campaigns and ad hominem attacks on personal character. Core has ~16 developers, a few of which have commit access and anyone who's disagreed with Core has had their access revoked. The longer it goes, the fewer people are allowed commit access to Core and the more vulnerable the team gets to echo chamber development and corruption. 
Bitcoin Cash has 4 separate teams with nearly 200 developers working on the same project. 


And that's your prerogative. I won't vilify you for making a decision with your own money. BCH was created because that part of the community believes that Blockstream and Core have now gained sole control over the development of Bitcoin. This is about decentralization first and functionality second. You're right that there are plenty of altcoins that are better or more functional than Bitcoin. But, unsurprisingly, this is yet another discussion I've been involved in over the last few days has devolved into "If you don't like it, use an alt coin." Even supporters of Core and Blockstream are admitting that BTC is unuseable and recommending that people use other cryptos if they want to actually have a functional currency. If that's not an indicator of a problem, I don't know what is. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:08:55
It depends what service you're using but some wallets and exchanges will show you the transaction even if it has no confirmations.
There are two stages to a Bitcoin transaction, the first stage is when the network acknowledges the tx and adds it to the block to be confirmed. The second stage is the confirmation process once the block is mined. It takes 6 blocks to fully confirm a transaction. 
When blocks aren't full, you will usually immediately see the transaction in the recipient wallet. If you're not seeing it, that means the network is so backlogged that it hasn't even been acknowledged yet. 
Worst case scenario, if your transaction never acknowledges, the payment will be reversed back into the parent account. If that account is an exchange, they should have a system in place to deal with that. I can't recall how long a tx needs to sit in limbo before it's purged but it's at least 48 hours.
Your BTC is probably fine and don't have anything to worry about. I'm sorry that your first interaction with Bitcoin has been so negative. This is the exact reason that a large portion of the community has moved to Bitcoin Cash where these problems don't happen.

Why would anyone open a channel with a friend? For the joy of paying extra fees for no reason?
Opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions and therefore 2 on-chain fees. Those are, of course, not including the LN useage fees which are currently a mystery.

When you remove anyone with a dissenting opinion and punish people for asking questions, that's when cults are born

It makes perfect sense. The miners are ignoring low-fee transactions because the blocks are backlogged. Small transactions are falling below their threshold so they aren't being propagated. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:31:15
0 conf transactions aren't even working on small BTC payments so there's no way that the vendor could possibly verify that an attempt to send has been made. People are waiting hours/days for their TX to even show up.

The writer of this article is wrong about a few things. First he believes that the BCH community has no interest in a L2 scaling solution which is completely untrue. And second he claims that bigger blocks only delay higher fees which is *the entire point of bigger blocks*. They can be increased again if needed but 8mb will go a long way. 
Are you aware that BCH did a hard fork today? Maybe not if you mainly spend time in this sub. All of the FUD around hard forks comes directly from Blockstream and Core.
Did you also know that the original version of Bitcoin actually had no block size limit at all? It was only added so that the network was more unlikely to be spam attacked by zero fee transactions which worked for the first few years because the blocks never got close to the 1mb cap. 
Lastly, if you want to run a node, you can do it with a Raspberry Pi using the on board memory and simply set it to purge transactions that are older than a certain age. You could have a 8gb memory card in it that never fills regardless of the block size. If you want to run a full node, you have to put up a couple more dollars and get larger storage which gets cheaper every year.

Nobody, not even supporters of BCH believe that bigger blocks are a long-term scaling solution. 
Bigger blocks are NECESSARY in order to alleviate congestion and allow the system to continue functioning normally while second layer solutions can be developed.
Rejecting a system maintenance increase in order to push a narrative or, more accurately, artificially create a need for your L2 product, is the reason that BCH has so much support. 
Blockstream and Core have crippled Bitcoin in order to sell their alternative technology and stick it to the miners. If 2X had been implemented at the same time as Segwit, BCH would not exist.

Centralized. Got it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:33:49
You're assuming that way over half of the global population will be making "multiple transactions a day"?
What exactly are you basing this on?
*Right now* over 1.3 BILLION people don't even have **electricity**.
53% of the world's population does not have internet access. 
These are two REQUIREMENTS to having or using Bitcoin. If **every single person** on the planet that had internet access used Bitcoin right now it would only be about 3.6 billion people.
Please provide some kind of realistic argument because the shit you just spouted is absolutely ridiculous and makes you sound like an idiot.

LN will only be free to use in a direct P2P setting and is also completely useless in that environment. 
Why would someone opt to use LN for a P2P transaction when it would require TWO on-chain transactions and thus 2 fees plus a third transaction on LN. 
Seriously. If you're going to tell people about LN, at least tell them the whole story. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:45:14
I suggest you sell

Sneak attack? BCH didn't do anything during the 2X drama, they just kept clearing transactions. The 2X people cancelled and moved to BCH because it's not been taken over by a single company with an agenda

Oh, sorry I over stated the diversity of the Core team. From what I can see, 11 people have commit access to Bitcoin Core. 
In the meanwhile, there are 4 major development teams working on BCH which total well over 100 developers. 
Publicly, meaning on the Bitcoin Core and Blockstream web sites, Luke Jr. is working for both Core and Blockstream. I don't even know if I need to mention anyone else because that guy is so unbelievably unhinged that I can't understand how he's not been pushed out. But I guess as long as he toes the party line he get's to stay on the team.

Traffic is not applicable to Bitcoin. Roads are limited by physical space and traffic is heavily affected by human psychology. The physical space that roads are built on does not get [progressiely cheaper]( every day. 
A more accurate analogy would be a hose. It's a unidirectional system moving information, not a multidirectional system moving people. 
If you have a 1" diameter hose that can move 100 literes per minute and then increase it to 8", it can move a LOT more water. If instead you decided to start attaching straws outside the hose, you might get more volume but now the hose has been weakened and there's far more points of vulnerability.

If you truly believe that Blockstream has no influence on Core you're too far gone. I will continue questioning things and doing my own research on these subjects, something you might think about doing yourself. 
Funny how, at your request, I provided you an example of conflict of interest between Core and Blockstream and you outright ignore it and accuse me of spreading FUD.
Now you've demonstrated that you actually don't care about facts at all, especially if they go against the narrative you've been fed. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:02:01
How does increasing the block size centralize Bitcoin exactly?

That's what happens when you're selling a store of value.

Oh, all "real" altcoin developers own crystal balls now? The only thing they underestimated was how quickly people would want to leave Bitcoin Core

You're arguing against my assertions that Blockstream is going to do what every company ever does and work only to maximize profits by using statements written by the company themselves? What guarantee do you have that they won't change their mind on every single point in their "initiatives"? 
I judge companies based on their actions, not some words and promises that have yet to be delivered. This whole subreddit always falls back to these same flimsy arguments using future events as reasoning for *current* problems. 
Meanwhile LN was delayed yet again because, big surprise, it doesn't work and barely a whimper from this sub while your blocks are full and people are paying hundreds of dollars to use their coins.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:34:05
If I'm wrong, please educate me. I have no problem changing my mind about things if presented with verifiable facts that contradict my current beliefs. This is not a religion to me or about what team I'm on, I care about the tech and I care about usability.

Lightning isn't even on the horizon. If you aren't aware it was just bumped from a Layer 2 solution to a Layer 3 solution. I guess the devs figured out that their concept was impossible to deliver after all.

You haven't given me any proof. You gave me opinions on a message board and a screenshot of the mempool from literally months ago.
As for the ASICBOOST drama, these guys invented a product that does the job of mining Cryptos better than anyone else and people are mad at them for not sharing it? It's 100% in their right to hold and defend their patent and utilize it themselves. I would expect any other company or person in the world to do the same thing. These guys aren't charity workers, they're in it for the profit and so are you.
This entire message board seems to spend half their time just complaining about miners which just further widens the divide between the communities. Miners are supposed to be greedy, Bitcoin was built with that assumption. Expecting them to do anything other than that is just delusion.
