They were each literally designed that way.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:42
You literally can't use more than 1 car at a time.
You literally can use a railroad by yourself. And even if you couldn't- what if you're not using the railroad to produce more capital?
But the point is; what do we do with this disagreement? How do you enforce the prohibition of private property without a state? What central authority has the final say? What central authority has the moral authority to confiscate private property?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:13:50


What's left wing if not liberal?
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:13:16
I dunno, Bernie Sanders is pretty set on getting the central Government to do everything.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:43:58


So like prohibition for property rights?


...bruh, Hillary was center left.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:05:38
Not agreeing with it doesn't mean I don't understand it. There's no internally consistent test or objective method to differentiate public from private property, and any enforcement or subjective determination of this rule would require a government or central authority, once again breaking the supposed flat power structure that far leftists want.

Pal. There's no way to separate the two.

What if we disagree on the distinction? You can't individually use 3 cars because you can only drive one, but you need a whole railroad to go somewhere. 
Which one of us has the moral authority to confiscate the other's personal property?

Nobody can tell you how comfortable you want your gap to be.

In the example of Bitcoin vs Bcash, if you post a transaction after the fork to the Bitcoin network your Bcash won't move with it.

If someone would be so nice as to explain how they knew who was sending them money.
My current understanding is that you scanned their wallet into your phone, and then transmitted money into it, and their wallet increased, and they know your address.
Did you not also have to type in your address to the form in order to claim the payment? Or is there something I'm missing?
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:53:38


Sort of. 
There will be no more violent enforcement of monopolies, or theft, or bombing third world countries, but everything else, like utilities, food inspection and road construction would be replaced. Seems like a win win.

Slavery is incompatible with the recognition of personal rights... I'm not sure how you're imagining slavery in a libertarian society.
Your question boils down to "What if 75% of people agree to create another government after there isn't one?"
If there's a central violent authority, that's really just a different name for government.

@_date: 2015-01-04 08:54:59
Wait, your previous comment, were you trying to imply that nobody currently pays for:
dropping bombs on perfect strangers two continents, and two oceans away.
the abduction, caging, feeding, and monitoring of people that grew a particular plant.
But to answer your question. I have no idea what would happen in your imaginary hypothetical.

@_date: 2015-01-03 23:09:31
Sort of. The concept of marijuana being illegal doesn't really make sense in an anarchist society. Nobody is allowed to declare it illigal, and nobody is allowed to use violence to intervene in another's marijuana use.
Things like prisons are only profitable because money is stolen to pay for them. If there were no taxes for prisons, you would have a very hard time making money caging other humans. And the violent abduction of peaceful people would be unpopular - to say the least.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:04:52
It doesn't. It doesn't prevent them from doing anything. Why?
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:28:32

Who's going to pay for bombs to drop on perfect strangers two continents, and two oceans away? - nobody.
Who's going to pay to abduct, cage, feed, and monitor people that grow a particular plant? - nobody.
Who's going to pay for roads? - everyone who wants to drive.
Who's going to pay for food inspections? - people that want their food inspected.

If units have different traceable histories, they are not all the same by that differentiation. Being different is incompatible with fungibility.

Get a wallet. Back it up in multiple locations. I have 3 USB keys each at my house and my parent's house. Take your time with this step. Learn about security and the possible ways your wallet can be compromised.
