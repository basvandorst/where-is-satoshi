It was just introduced on 11/28/2017 but it is better to start now so we can nip it in the bud before it goes any further.

If you want to protect Bitcoin (Americans) Call your REPS ON:
**S.1241 - Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017**
Get off yer asses.. this bill would not only require exchanges to follow the same money laundering laws as banks, it would legislate away your right to your private keys, and allow the DHS to imprison you - it creates the complicated legal necessities to claim that anyone holding cryptocurrencies is a terrorist or is laundering money.
**Fuck your private keys:**
(c) Customs and border protection strategy for prepaid access devices.—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall submit to Congress a report—
**(1) detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States; and**
(2) that includes an assessment of infrastructure needed to carry out the strategy detailed in paragraph (1).
**You're a bank, harry:**
31 U.S.C. Section 5312 ammended to read:
“financial institution” means--
or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency
Just read the bill, it's fucking horrible:

Yep, they want to treat all crypto as a possibility for drugs or terrorism. Fucking ludicrous.

As a vendor you can accept that as payment and not have to worry about the % that credit card transaction processing is taking off the top of all sales.
