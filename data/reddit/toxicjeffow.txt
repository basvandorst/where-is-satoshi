If he wants to be Satoshi he must first realize that manipulating the Matrix isn't about focusing on an object and trying to change it. The object doesn't exist, so he can't change it, he has to change himself.

Haters gonna hate? I'm not trying to make a BCH v BTC statement, nor troll - just making satire for entertainment. If it really offends Roger I'll take it down. But he don't give a fuck, his middle name is Keith.

Thanks man, I appreciate it. Glad you liked the mash up.

It's a shame it got banned (for duplicate posting) as I had a rant (it also applies to some people over here tbh). I was interested in seeing the response: [

I've just reported him, and linked him to this thread. I will keep you updated. Fingers crossed LBC deal with this.

So you're saying the overheating laptop and listening to endless Roger interviews again and again, was all worth it then? My wife disagrees.

Haha! I love your post title, made me laugh. I think you were a Kamikaze pilot in your former life.

Glad you liked it dude.

Well he speaks fucking fast, I'll give him that. Maybe the king of WPM?
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:36:25
Thanks for the feedback. I kind of agree, it doesn't sound as clean as I would have liked.
I blame Roger - he speaks too fast and seldom pauses between words, forcing me to crop the word short.

Roger Ver has done a lot for crypto, lets all make friends and live in peace forever and ever. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Maybe if I do one on Craig Wright, Roger will forgive me?

Update: He's now given me negative feedback and called me a scammer. RIP my rating.
