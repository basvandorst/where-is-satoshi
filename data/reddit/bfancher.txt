We don't know who the creator is or how old he or she is, so how can we possibly know how long their lifetime is likely to be (even as much as we can know how long anyone's is)?

Yes. Shred the paper wallet in a blender, mix with water and drink it down.

Wrong.  The U.S. economy is still larger than China's, and the U.S. is still the world's largest manufacturer: 
The reason that people think that "we don't make anything anymore" is because the kinds of things that are manufactured in the U.S., like jet engines, earth movers, industrial robots, etc., aren't things that you see for sale at the local mall.

The difference is that if you lose your credit or debit card, you're out (at most) $50.  If you lose the device your bitcoins are on, whether it's a phone, or a laptop or a "bitcoin hardware wallet", your bitcoins are gone for good.  Even if you've got them stored in an online wallet, if someone, somehow, hacks your account and accesses the wallet, there's no way to recover them.  This is very different than a debit or credit card.
