noooooooooooooooo Amanda!!!! Why?!?!?!?! :(
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:30:43
why don't use bitsquare?

for sure Theymos, is better to have a B plan.. as POS or other brillant idea that maybe someone is on the right way to propose asap :)
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:52:20
Thanks for the link! I look on it too ;)
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:55:31
it seems that POS isn't yet mature, but maybe in future it can be used gradually
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:56:53
Personally i think that is better to have mining centers all around the world and not mainly in only one nation.
@_date: 2016-04-12 19:06:14
Surely they have more ideas than only implementing it on website
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:01:22
Thanks Rusty for your new post :) Very very interesting!
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:30:56
It could be nice in order to incentivize the use of mining for the hardware like phones, routers, usb keys to add a kind of lottery. (Maybe 21.co  has thinked of it yet..) In a website will be listed all bitcoin addresses that mining in solo or in a "lottery" pool.. and every month will be choose one or some bitcoin address from that list and they will receive into that address x bitcoin as winning (or better.. they search into the site if they had win and then ask for the collection, if not the jackpot will rise).. the others bitcoin will be divided between current PoW and ASIC-resistant PoW.
@_date: 2016-04-10 16:05:17
it would be a nice dream.. but china loves yuan more than bitcoin (for now..)!
@_date: 2016-04-22 10:09:16
I suggest to buy an hardware wallet like Trezor and to move there all your bitcoin

It's a joke? : )
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:51:58
Wrong, there are a lot of miners in China, in my opinion is a problem to resolve. Bitcoin will be more strong with decentralize mining.

Thanks for reply kinyutaka! I was seeing how works these kind of sites, but it seems that there are bots and so on.. "new users born" and win articles, where real people that push the order button, isn't take by the site... so if with close source, these kind of site are scam or similar. Only using open source, it can works without bad actors and all open! Sorry for my english!

Maybe he (she/they) has changed idea in five years.. surely the opinion of the dad of the Bitcoin will help dev cores to unity, but as i said in other comment, i'm sure that without Satoshi too.. developers will take the better way possible to resolve it.

I met Manfred Karrer in Milan last month and talk with him a little at the end of the presentation, he's a very nice person. Bitsquare is one of the best apps in the bitcoin's enviroment! I suggest to all to download and try it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:45:11
yes.. mynode is a project of six months.. raspiblitz and raspibolt are older.. but if you check the features.. is another world :) in past i used raspibolt (very good to learn)
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:22:33
I started with raspibolt too.. Very nice project to start! I have learned a lot too thanks to stadicus. The error in the bitcoin daemon is normal as at start script will start to download whole blockchain. Probably you didn't connect to webinterface too where it told it. If you came on telegram channel of myNode.. There was more than 2 hundred people ready to help.
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:41:24
I guess that you don't know this new project  [  ( [ ) it's light years ahead the other full nodes like raspibolt and C.
If you have a rpi4 or a rock64 and an hdd or ssd you have all.. the software is OPEN SOURCE and for basic things is FREE. Telegram official channel -&gt;  [

QuickSync - Quickly sync Bitcoin blockchain (you can choose to use it or not)

Sure! The app will download a .torrent file with a good part of the blockchain.. and when done bitcoind continue to download the rest of the blockchain. But if you want.. you can download all blocks without QuickSync.
come in the official channel of the community on telegram.. there are more than one hundred people there -&gt;  [

"In light of Ethereum’s recent problems with its imperative, account-based, programming model, I thought I’d do a quick writeup outlining the building blocks of the state-machine approach to so-called “smart contract” systems, an extension of Bitcoin’s own design that I personally have been developing for a number of years now as my Proofchains/Dex research work."

I'm redditor user since some years.. The file is ok. Thanks however for the advise :) 
@_date: 2019-11-10 14:46:40
If i can suggest.. i own nodes for about two years. I have started with raspibolt and i learned a lot from it.. but after.. listen.. The better thing to do is to buy a specialized hw like RASPBERRY PI 4 with 4GB of RAM, an HDD or SSD of  1TB to plug into the USB3 port of rpi4 and a MICROSD of 16GB where to put the software.
Actually the better software to handle a bitcoin full node and a lot of other stuff is MYNODE (  [ ).
It's an OPEN SOURCE project with a lot of features.. for example TOR is enabled by default.. you will have BITCOIN FULL NODE, LND, ELECTRUM SERVER and so on.. this is the github page if you want to help to the project:  [ , and  Telegram official channel -&gt; [ .
And most important.. for almost all of features this project is FREE. You have only to download the image from the site, put into microsd, plug in the HDD to rpi4 and magically all will works.. it will format and partitioning the HDD and start to download the blockchain :)

it seems that hashrate is grown in few hours of about 30%... absurd!
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:11:56
I had same result on my bitcoin full node doing this command ([chain.so]( take the hashrate's value from this command too):

Yeah, very nice idea about medical/nutritional advisor! With OpenBazaar and bitcoin there will be a lot of new jobs with instant payments and fast replies, even if in case of doctors is more delicate arguments. 
Is from about first years of 2000 that i buy items online and i acquired a lot of experience, with prices, shops, comparatives of products.. i have save thousand and thousand of euros with my online purchases so now i'd like to help other people doing it and obviously take a little percentage of the money that i have made save :)
Thanks for contacted me ;)

Bitcoub's low of $1,800+ yesterday simply could not be maintained. In the long term Bitcoin moves above  $500,000 within three years. Bets?
