I've pretty much accepted it's gone and have since bought some more bitcoins with the aim of making back my losses when the price goes up to $2,500 this summer. (Yeh, we can dream right? :P)
As for getting back our lost coins, I've signed up to two "class action" law suit things but doubt they will actually go anywhere tbh. Worth a shot as long as I'm not asked to pay anything of course.
We can always wait and hope... I think Mark is genuinely sorry for what happened and if there is any way he can get our coins back he will. I'm still a bit confused by what his plan is but it seems they want to reboot mtgox and maybe make us share holders? I doubt that will really be very profitable tbh, i'll get like a 0.0001% share or something and the profits they'll back when back in business will be a fraction of what they ever made before. 
It's also a little disconcerting that they seemed to not mention the BTCs when they were referring to their losses/assets in their statements on the website.
Fingers crossed though :)
Hope you didn't loose too much.

27.5 coins sadly :( Bought with a £15k initial investment too... 
I ain't got my hopes up that I'll be seeing that again either. Would be a nice surprise though. For now I'm just planning to buy more and trade to recoup my losses by trading :P

Thank you :) Was trying to find discussion on this and didn't see anything on BitCoin News 247 twitter feed or the r/bitcoin main feed. I was dubious that I was the first to f5 the site but clearly i'm not quite the reddit pro just yet, thanks for the tip :)

Harsh, he didn't get 'fat' until this whole thing blew up and the stress got the better of him and resulted in him gaining a lot of weight :(
Also, I actually like him. As a fellow aspergers, He's alright in my book, I can read his body language quite easily and tell he's quietly confident but also shocked by the insane amounts of attention he'd rather just not have to deal with. He just wants to get back to his quite self to continue working. Whatever the problem is, I hope he can resolve it given enough time, if not, I feel for him as it's a horrible situation to be put in.
Speaking as a person who's lost 27 btc (£15k investment) because of this, the only person I would be annoyed at is the thieves who took the bitcoins if they were actually stolen. If it's an internal mistake, then I feel sorry for them as if it's not recoverable then they've killed a potentially huge company. I used gox as it was the nicest of the exchanges for trading (everything displayed on one page and had great trade history keeping) and had a good API too. 
Saying that...
They had ONE job, The one thing they didn't want to happen, and they managed to let it - loose their bitcoin stash. Not the best way to run an exchange :(
/end rant.
I feel for him :(
But damn they should of kept better care of the coins!!

Just followed the steps and I gotta say, WOW! this is really cool!! I see they'll soon have facebook implemented too :D I can't wait to tip my friends, as everyone has said it's a great way to introduce people to bitcoin as they'll have some incentive knowing they have bitcoins waiting for them :)
When i've finished testing it out by tipping back and forth between twitter and my reddit account i'll return the tip back to you :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:48:34
Ah I didn't know! haha
Thank you! It really is an excellent service, very professional and easier to use than I was expecting!
I'll indeed send the tip on then :)

It's weird how on this address, it sends to:
Which then sends to:
And that then goes to:
A "Silkroad Seized Coins" address:
Is that just really unlucky or do loads of addresses end up at a silkroad seized coins address?

You're a greedy troll seeking some food... Here's a little bit for ya. The least I could do :P
As for learning lessons, I learnt that trading bitcoin is extremely profitable and despite the losses I'm still better off with than without :)
Lastly, as for tldr, you clearly read it so what's with the "dr" ? ;)
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:05:34
This may seem blinding obvious (pun intended), but making the bitcoin donation page presence very small, dull, non-shiny would prevent non-bitcoin users noticing it at all (As a Brit, if i see "dwola" payment options or "okpay" I ignore them as they sound irrelevant to me and uninteresting)
So a simple, tiny, grey scale bitcoin image (the coin with a b on it) next to the usual Visa, Paypal etc. Only bitcoin users would recognize it hence no wandering off to learn about bitcoin right when it's donation time.
Or you can just stick a bitcoin address right at the bottom of the page all alone with no description in plane text. Non-bitcoiners would ignore it and think it's something to do with making the website work. Bitcoiners would see it is a donation address :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:42:46
Yep, mine is there too. Not fun having your private information leaked :P Wasn't expecting to see it there tbh. Seriously, Mark has terrible security :(
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:55:38
:O Didn't think of that!!! You might be onto something here!

Haha like the quote :)
And thanks, I once had just over 100BTC :( Crazy how easy it is to loose that down to 27 by trying to play the big swings back in April and also this most recent rush from 100 to 1000... I could have had £150,000 had I just left it. Lesson learned indeed. Then again, I'd be SERIOUSLY upset if I'd lost £150k :P

The benefit of allowing the entire world to read and potentially add a solution to a problem far outweighs the slight inconveniance of the odd spam that might occur. I'm sure the Dev's are used to looking past spam emails that the odd off topic post wont kill their development effort.
The solution to reducing the spam is pretty simple though, as the person who starts the discussion to specify a Question and Answer required to take part in that discussion. I.e. a technical question related to the topic such as what's the number of confirmations required to make transaction malleability a none-issue?

So far my twitter tip hasn't been registered, I've waited a few minutes, I'm guessing it takes a while for the bot to detect it...
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:28:35
I have it recorded on my sky+ box and it's on Iplayer too. I can record a clip on my phone and upload it if you wish :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:40:57
How do tipping bots work btw?
Do you have to register with the bot and give it your private key? (I presume not  :p)
So do you load it up with some bitcoins and then start tipping people? How does someone claim their tip? Does the bot create an address for them and PM the private key? :/
If someone wants to tip me 0.00000001 BTC so I can see it first hand go ahead :P (this isn't a begging for money thing though, i'm just interested how it works).
Question is relation to both reddit btc tip's and this twitter tip bot.

Why I stuck with Gox and as a result lost ~28BTC...
Firstly, Started using gox about a year ago so was fully verified and used it to buy my first bitcoins. Was scary and I tried many methods (OTC, Blockchain.info) and in the end risked the scary practice of sending £5000 to a foreign country via a wire transfer. It arrived safetly and so +1 to my trust in Gox.
I then developed software to create graphs and send SMS alerts to my phone using the gox API.
I was aware of Gox's lag issues (especially aware when it caused the crash from $260) but with it being the biggest exchange at the time and having a good API and more uptime than bitstamp I stayed with it. Granted there were warning signs but tbh, there always were and they had always pulled through in the past. They had gained a lot of respect from me for their resilience. 
I did try using bitstamp but their CSV exports didn't include running balances, the advanced trading didn't show your open orders on the same page and didn't let you specify "Amount of USD to spend" when buying bitcoins. So all in all, it was much more cumbersome to trade with compared to Gox.
I was a day (well "twice weekly") trader, made about £300 a week on average during the "non-growth" times of weekly rise and falls. (Gutted after months of hard work I lost ever penny in the end!!)
So combining my custom code with the API, my preference to Gox's trading website to Bitstamps, my verification status on Gox and the pretty much 24/7 uptime I stayed with Gox despite the fiat withdraw issues (because I just assumed I could do a BTC withdraw as I had many times before and sell somewhere else). The argument that the goverments/banks were just making life difficult for BTC to fiat conversion seemed very plausable, especially since I witnessed first hand when Gox's Barclay's bank account was shutdown here in the UK. 
When the BTC withdraws broke I had the choice to either use bitcoinbuilder and loose a big % of just stay and wait for them to "fix" the problem which at the time seemed likely as the smoke and mirrors was very confusing for everyone and no one seemed to know what was going on at the time.
So there you have it, my reasons for not jumping ship. I hope that helps some of those who can't understand why anyone would ever be so "stupid" (or naive) to even touch MtGox with their BTC. I and many were tricked by the lies and deceit, count yourselves lucky you weren't :)

@_date: 2013-04-03 11:06:04
As I just said on BTCTalk:
They are inflating the price. New bitcoin users come to buy $500 worth of bitcoins and see the 'highest ask' / 'last' at say $135 when if you take away all the "scaffolding" (the hundreds of asks for 0.01 BTC with increments of $0.025) it would actually be like $125.
Sadly the "newbie" bitcoin users doesn't know that the recommended ask price on mt.gox of $135 is actually erroneous and should really be much lower (such as $100 considering its nearly all "scaffolding"). So proper orders are being foolishly placed ontop of this "scaffolding". They end result being the newbies inadvertently, and independently peg up the price high. And so more scaffolding is build up on top of that.
It's a vicious cycle and wont stop untill newbies learn to look at the deep market orders. Sadly MT.Gox keeps that hidden and unless you have half a brain and google for it you'll just take what mt.gox shows you and place a bid foolishly. (*source: I did this when I first bought some BTC :p)
p.s. "Scaffolding" is a term I invented last night after 4 hours of watching the price go up in huge jumps with only a few actual purchases of (&gt; 20BTC) appearing between rises of $2 from empty 0.01BTC orders acting as inflatory filler.
