Ofcourse, the blockchain will always be under attack, and needs to prove itself.
But it is in the consumers and customers hands to demand better offerings from companies, and in a pure capitalist marketplace like this, we need to stand together and tell companies what we expect.
Both by boycott, and "protests", online and offline (in this case offline is tricky, so we will have to complain loudly online on reddit and Twitter etc).

Hmm, I think we can get there if we plan for the summer, how much does a small pizza hut/domino's pizza cost? How much discount do you think we can get on 10'000 pizzas? ����

Yeah, everybody should tell people how they expect the business to be run. Ever heard about free speech?
In the end its about the money obviously, but hopefully more people will join me and demand responsible use for the best for everyone, and hopefully Coinbase (and others) will recognize that implementing what their users want is in their best interests.

Yup, absolutely, I will definitely take my business elsewhere, and hopefully LN and schnorr signatures will be deployed faster because of this.

Well, I assume 100% ( ~30 000) of the 0-5 sathoshi/byte transactions are spam, so that leaves only 10 000 low priority transactions that should be cleared within a few days :)
(I made a second low fee transactions with only 10 sat/byte, took 1 hour to confirm :)

I have some bad news for you :(
Google Authenticator can't be backed up (I recommend Authy instead!)
Also, when you set up 2-factor-auth in Electrum, you got a list of recovery/backup-key-words, you **have** to get those to recover your funds :)




Good luck!
