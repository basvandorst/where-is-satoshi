1 bitcoin is now worth $2,500. It rises that fast. I'm trading my bitcoins via Paxful which gives good rate exchange.

That's huge and risky. You will need to undergo verification process fin any site for sure. I suggest buying bitcoins in a small batch amount via Paxful.

I'd better stay with Paxful when buying and trading my bitcoins because I haven't had any issues from the time I started joining them plus, they use an escrow and always protect my trades from scammers.

Bitcoin is a good investment nowadays. People took it for granted a few years ago and thought it doesn't have value. Now, these people are regretting as to why they took it for granted. I kept my first bitcoin I received from a friend in Japan years ago. I myself admit that I took it for granted as well like other people does. But I did not throw it away. Until I heard how bitcoin rises and I'm lucky to say that my first bitcoins are now earned at $5000+. I trade some on Paxful and enjoying the profit :)

Register with Paxful and buy from there. They don't require an ID or verification. They use an escrow too safe for you to buy.

That's risky. You need to find where you can secure it. A secure Bitcoin wallet. I suggest you buy a small amount in batch via Paxful and start from there.

I invest my bitcoins thru Paxful. They are one of the reliable places to trade. They also trade giftcards and vice versa. One thing I like Pax is that they use an escrow and I can chat with their moderators anytime because they are on a 24/7 shift. had no issues ever since.

Try  They cover the US and most of the countries actually and uses an escrow.

Not sure about Game of Thrones tabletop. But if you have GCs, It is acceptable thru Paxful. They buy and sell GCs at a good rate.

Check Paxful. They cover most of the countries and have several payment methods to choose from. I used my US visa debit card and had no issue. No hassle. Transaction was instant

Good to know that they now have a tutorial in Facebook. I was watching their video tutorials on Youtube. Paxful is expanding. This is great! :)
