I’m fairly new, so not certain. I didn’t realize for awhile because of hodl. Then I went to send btc as payment earlier this week and saw that my funds available to send didn’t include btc I had bought days before.

Cashapp does have fees but they’re hidden. They botch the exchange rate in their favor when you buy and sell

High hashrate is a good thing. It means that a lot of new btc is being mined right now. People being willing to mine that amount of bitcoin indicates that it’s worth the amount of capital, time, and energy it takes to do it. 
A good analogy is: if gold were being mined at highest rate ever, miners are pouring money into drills, land, research, labor, etc. It would similarly be a good indicator for the future value.

100k in 3-4 years? Sounds farfetched, but I’m new to this. Is that sort of price more of an if or when?

I told myself it would go lower. I told myself to wait for the low 9s...

Coinbase pro is my go to for trading. I use cashapp when I’m buying something since I can send btc I buy instantly rather than waiting over a week.

There’s no evidence that btc and ant miners cost fiat currency? Neat.

That’s just my politics showing, sorry. 
A better way to put it would be:
Take group Z of people: rank them based on their wealth in fiat. Then rank them based on their wealth in crypto/btc.
The two lists of ranks will likely look the same or similar because fiat can buy you an advantage in crypto. 
If the  variable in how much crypto you’re able to buy or mine is a variable that reflects privilege, then how is the outcome that uses that variable NOT reflecting the same privilege?

Why are you pretending there is no special privilege given to people that can afford to keep a few hundred thousand dollars invested in btc or a mining farm?
This is like when paying women less was finally outlawed, and employers started decided pay based off of your previous pay. They claimed “there’s no disadvantage to being a woman, this way of deciding pay just considers what you used make!” 
Except the employers knew damn well that before they had to use “previous pay” as a factor in deciding current pay, they just used “you are a woman” to decide pay. So in reality using “previous pay” as an input was still just a way to pay women less, and the SCOTUS ruled it illegal. 
You’re using the same logic as the employers. “No there’s no privilege in X mining operation getting the 12 btc reward, they did the work!” 
I know X did the work. But X was only able to do the work because they could afford massive amounts of electricity, thousands of ant miners, either the time to set-up and keep the operation running themselves, or money to pay someone to do the same. 
All of the inputs to them having that work done were based on special privilege is my point.  
Do you see what I’m saying?

You prove your work that you did with multimillion dollar investments into mining operations? 
How is it not exactly the privileged class in charge still??
Like I get it: I can join a mining pool and get in on the action, but one’s returns with mining will almost exactly reflect how large an investment was made in fiat currency.

The ~~advantage~~ special privilege is being able to buy all those machines... are you being dense on purpose? Sorry if I’m wooshing.
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:42:03
Remember that time I said I get it and explained exactly what you just explained??
The amount of btc/other crypto that someone can mine, or buy solely depends on how much fiat is available to them. 
If you were to rank the wealth of a group of people measured in crypto, and then rank the same group’s wealth measured in fiat: the ranking will be very similar if not the same... that’s not a coincidence. It’s because having a special privilege in fiat can buy you a special privilege in crypto.

Big yes. If you use coinbase there’s some file you can download and put into TurboTax with all your transactions.
