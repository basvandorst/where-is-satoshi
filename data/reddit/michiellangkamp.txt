They do worry about this. Thats why usually they have good insurance and good security. 
And there are lots of bad willing people targeting the rich and famous. Houses get broken into all the time. 
Like [this]( gang in the uk. 
And lots more examples like that. 
Hell even kim kardashian got robbed at gun point a while back. 
But a nerdy person living alone or whatever with a stack of btc is a much easier target in the minds of bad willing people i’d imagine.

If his techniques make for better then 50% chances of being right, why isn’t he crazy rich and retired somewhere?

And those things aren’t used on a massive scale

All the miners in that pool ( a lot of the miners aren’t in China, they are all over the globe). Would just direct their hashing power away from the pool that is trying a 51% attack.

Why would all of them destroy their source of income.

A lot of these youtube crypto “experts” offer courses “they” made. 
Most if not all, going by peoples reviews, arent worth shit. 
Their goal is to make as much money, as fast as possible. 
Don’t know about this one specifically. 
But I would just use that money to invest. And research on your own. 
All you need and can know is freely available on the internet
Edit: And to add to this, if the information he gives in this course, would make you good money. Why would he need to sell the courses in the first place. 
Why doesn’t he just use that info himself and trade himself to the top.
People like this make money with their social media, youtube etc. Not with trading. 
TA is their vehicle to sell you stuff, get views and get add revenue.

Well kinda true I guess, bankrupt for a company is a bit different then bankrupt for a country. 
My country ( The netherlands ) went bankrupt in the 19 th century tho, and it went from a republic to a monarchy system. The old system completly fell and the whole country was changed. Basicly a new country was formed, with different borders and all.

Lol, the fix is in the guide... please read the guide before crying about something you quite clearly don’t understand. 
And a second thing. Your coins are never on the ledger. Or any wallet that you use, will never store any coins. They always stay on the blockchain. Thats how blockchains work. Your ledger holds the private keys to them.

Read the guide posted here. 
 If the firmware version identified in Step 1 was 1.3.1 or lower, the Ledger Nano S will display MCU firmware is outdated (left side of the image below) and To begin, connect your Ledger Wallet on the Ledger Manager (right side of the image below). In this case, go to Step 6.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:32:41
If you can’t read a simple guide..  I will assume you are a noob indeed. 
 If the firmware version identified in Step 1 was 1.3.1 or lower, the Ledger Nano S will display MCU firmware is outdated (left side of the image below) and To begin, connect your Ledger Wallet on the Ledger Manager (right side of the image below). In this case, go to Step 6.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:37:26
This would be step 6 of the guide. And it will fix your user error.
6.	Reboot the Ledger Nano S
Unplug and replug your Ledger Nano S to your computer while holding the left button. The left button is the one near the USB connector. 
Bootloader is displayed on the Ledger Nano S while Restoring MCU is shown on the Ledger Manager.
During the MCU update, Update then Processing will be displayed on the Ledger Nano S and Installing firmware on the Ledger Manager. This procedure can take a few minutes. 
The Ledger Nano S might now display Update while the Ledger Manager shows the default message To begin, connect your Ledger Wallet. If this happens, wait a few minutes for the Installing firmware message to appear. Follow the next steps if it does not appear.
-	Quit and launch the Ledger Manager on the computer.
-	Disconnect and reconnect the Ledger Nano S to the computer using the USB cable.
-	Unlock the Ledger Nano S by entering your PIN code.
-	The process should restart. Still having an issue? Please check our FAQ for troubleshooting tips.

It does work. I think you ment to say it doesn’t work for you. 
A lot of people were/are in the same boat. And it worked for them. Seen it a lot on reddit. 
Usually when it doesnt work at first for people, it is becuase they didn’t follow the instructions meticulously. 
Try again would be my advice.

He is talking about a physical atack on you. 5 dollar wrench atacks, they sadly happen. 
When/if bitcoin goes parabolic again, you’ll be very interesting to a lot of people with bad intentions. 
You have broadcasted to the whole world that you have 3 btc ( maybe worth a lot, live changing money even in the future) 
You bet your ass people with bad intentions will see you as a potential mark. And will go to great lengths to get your money, be it via hacking/phising/physical or other means. 
You have an old acount with a lot of comment and post history, it probaly isnt hard to find out who you are and where you live. 
Or get your ip from reddits servers. 
Why risk al this by broadcasting what you have.

I don’t know. Probaly. Nerdy kids/people with Btc tend to be easier targets in the minds of bad willing people maybe. 
Or btc is easier to fence maybe, I dunno. 
But people get robbed or get broken into their houses all the time ( thats why you have your car and jewelery insured) 
If you drive your fancy car through a bad neighbourhood, you have a chance you get carjacked or become a target too. 
Broadcasting your Btc you have on the internet would have the same effect I think. 
And hell, even Kim kardashian got robbed at gun point a couple of years back.

Because Bezos lives in a highly secured house with a security team and has bodygaurds... 
Plus he is a public figure, so lots and lots of attention when you try to get to him. 
Meanwhile OP is a kid in his early 20ies who is an very easy target.
And probaly isn’t well conected, so little chance of retaliation ( people coming after you when you rob him)
You can’t just knock on Bezos his door ( or any high-profile target) 
But a nerdy young dude, who lives alone and has a couple of Btc... worth the risk for a lot of bad people. 
And those couple of Btc might be worth a lot more than a couple K in the future. 
Even so a couple K are a lot for someone who has nothing. People have been robbed for less. 
Robbing Bezos or any high profile target is a lot more risky then a young Btc owner.

It doesn’t matter. No funds are stored on the devices. Just the private keys derived from your seed words. 
Bitcoins never leave the blockchain. You just get writing rights on the ledger with your private keys. 
Save the seed words, phisically in a secure and safe way.

I thought we were talking about Btc and you wanting to put copyrights on aspects on it.
There are forks and other projects( coins/tokens) plenty that do that. 
But the whole point of Btc is that it’s open source and decentralized. 
Putting copyrights on it defeats the point of it. 
You’re free to create whatever you want, and let others use them for free or charge them for it. 
And other people are free to accept that and use it or not.

It could go down in the meantime too. 
With robinhood you don’t own any Btc btw. 
So I would sell it asap and buy real Btc somewhere else, and store in a wallet where you have control over the private keys. 
Preferably a Hardware wallet like ledger nano s/x or trezor.

It would just mean less hash power in the network —&gt; difficulty of mining decreases—-&gt; mining costs less —&gt; other people/company’s/etc will pick up mining ( because it is profitable again for them)—&gt; btc gets more decentralized.—&gt;hash power grows——&gt; network strengthens. 
Rince and repeat. With an upward momentum.
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:19:26

@_date: 2019-04-11 11:10:40
They are talking about banning mining, different from banning bitcoin alltogether. Which they can enforce more easily. 
But I think that would be a good thing, if they ban mining. 
In the long run it would lead to more decentralization I think. 
If the big mining company’s like bitmain are forced to shutdown by chinese government ( wich they can if they want). 
Then the total hash power of the btc network will drop. Then btc mining difficulty will adjust accordingly. 
Then it would be provitable to mine again in a lot of other places. 
Other people/company’s etc will pick up mining again,  leading to more decentralization. 
The network will get stronger again. More total hashpower, but more decentralized. 
Rince and repeat with an upward trend.
Edit: they most certainly have banned and laid restrictions plenty of times. And they have had an impact.

In the Netherlands its real easy, it is seen as property/capital tax, evertything under 25k is tax free, (50k if you have a partner/married)
25k to 100k = 0,86% tax
100k to 1000k = 1,38 % tax
1 million and up = 1,68% tax
They take the first day of the year to asses what the worth of your crypto is, what the taxable amount is. 
So it takes no time at all

The private keys are derived from the seed words. 
The 24 word seed is used to create your private keys. 
And since the words are created when you first setup the device, no one else has them. 
Please read how seed phrases work here, its a good read. And a must know for anyone investing in crypto. 
[Here]( you can read how it works
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:24:58
If someone finds or has acces to the 24 word seed. 
They would have to brute force only one word to acces your funds.  ( don’t know how easy or hard this is, maybe someone else can chime in )
I use a 25th phrase obviously, but I would never ever think ligthly about going about carelessly with the 24 word seed.

This is clearly a scam dude. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:15:07
Because the private key is created from those 24 words. 
Simply put: the words become the private key. 
First you get the words when you setup the device, then the device uses those words to create the private keys. 
So you can use those words on any BIP39 device to restore your device. Because those 24 words will create the same private keys again. Using math to translate them into your keys. 
Those 24 words always produce the same private keys. Read the article I posted.

They are lost. Can’t reverse a transaction. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:43:28
Ledger uses a secure element chip to store the private key.
In simplified terms this means that the private key is stored on a special chip that is almost like a small computer with a Operating System with a very strict and well defined interface. This interface is designed to NEVER allow an extraction of the private key except during the creation of the key when the seed is shown on the display. The only operation that uses the private key that is supported is to send input (read transactions in terms of bitcoin) that the chip signs with the private key, and then returns the signature. Therefore the only output you could get from the chip is the signed transaction, and never the private key, no matter where you put the chip.
tl:dr : the private key never leaves the device, it can’t leave the device. Thats how its designed. 
The private key is created when you first initialize the device, so no else but you has it.

Supply and demand I suppose. Just like it is now with fiat.

It is very socialist. 
socialisme isnt a bad word imo. Look at the link I posted in this thread, it works over here. 
Not total socialisme, just certain aspects work, at least in my country and some of the other most prosparing country’s aswell. 
People are naturaly greedy I think. Only people who can criticaly think about themself and the world escape these chains. 
Edit: I do agree that voluntary funding would be much better, but I don’t think we are there yet as a society.

Maybe, but generaly speaking, people need incentive to share what they have with the people that are less fortunate or less able to fend for themselfs I think.

Define ‘fair’
Taxes aren’t inherently bad imo. If they are used for the common good, 
examples: if they are used to care for the sick&amp;weak, public infrastructue, public facilities, health care etc. etc.
So yea I do believe taxes are fair if they are used correctly. 
[studies]( show that country’s with some of the highest taxes, and where the taxes are used for the common good, are generaly the most happy country’s. 
Most people in those country’s call themselfs happy.

@_date: 2019-01-23 05:51:37
Thats not true at all. 
If ledger would store your private keys on their servers, no one would buy a ledger. 
The whole point of the device is that you are in control of your private keys, in a secure way. 
You are the only one in the world who has come to this really wierd conclusion. 
Do you really believe erveryone else is wrong? And that you are the only one that is right in the world? 
This is my last message.

It is. 
Be carefull about posting screenshots on the internet.

In the Netherlands its real easy, it is seen as property/capital tax, evertything under €25k is tax free, (50k if you have a partner/married)
25k to 100k = 0,86% tax
100k to 1000k = 1,38 % tax
1 million and up = 1,68% tax
( in €  of course)
They take the first day of the year to asses what the worth of your crypto is, what the taxable amount is.

Only if you don’t store it on a exchange. Or in a wallet that doesn’t let you keep the keys. 
Else, it can still easily be seized. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:41:49
Thats the way to go, actually use BTC. 
Spend and replace! Use it. 
Btc is meant te be used. Not just a assest you hold.

Most likely you will get private messages from people wanting to “help” or something. 
Don’t respond to them. They are not trying to help you. 
If someone really wants to help or give advice, they will do so in a public thread where their comments can be seen by the whole cummunity and be judged to be true and sincere or not.

That would mean no one can buy either...
@_date: 2019-09-17 16:30:18
Yeah, its still his until it is spent. 
UTXO = unspent transaction output. The bitcoin ledger basically just keeps record of the UTXO’s to determine wich Btc belongs to who. 
Crudely said.

Excactly, bitcoin isn’t replacing pencils.

[these]( videos explain things very well. Andreas Antonopoulos is one of the most well respected and knowledgeable people in the cryptocommunity. 
I suggest watching all of the bitcoin for beginners playlist that I linked. Just start at the beginning. 
He also does a lot of Q&amp;A.

All exchanges opperate like this. They just facilitate the trades. 
The second thing you are describing is more like a broker.
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:43:09
No you dont have to. It is an option sure. 
But every node has an expiration time too for UTXO that don’t get picked up. 
If an UTXO isn’t confirmed ater that time, the funds can be used again.
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:35:59
Sounds plausible.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:54:46
My advice: don’t take advice from random people on the internet. /s
No one knows what is going to happen. 
  
Ask yourself this: am I willing to lose what I invested? ( can I afford to lose it?)
If the answer is no, sell. If the answer is yes, let it ride. 
That’s my take on it, how I invest/gamble.

Tamper proof seal is something different then plastic wrap. The do come wrapped.

They should come plastic wrapped. I’ve ordered 3 in the last 6 months. All came wrapped. See atached photo i googled, lots of them to be found online. 
Doesnt mean this one isn’t secure tho. Wipe it and set up new seed. 
In doubt, return it. Buy from official site.  Peace of mind is worth a lot.

Very misleading/confusing title. 
The article is about volume on localbitcoins only. So purely p2p based bitcoin sales. In a weeks time. 
$186.000  traded on exchanges in Korea is nothing. 
$186.000 traded solely p2p is another thing entirely.
