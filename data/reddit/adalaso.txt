thx. what fact decides if a user got a bitgo wallet or not? i have a btc deposit adress, does that mean, i dont have bitgo? is the deposit adress the adress i have to monitor, to know, if i am concerned by the hack ? (i dont have any movement on that adress)

this is the history of banking/share/financial market history of the last 100 years repeated with bitcoin. reminds me of bad fund-setups before the big regulation came.
is there a good not to technical explanation somewhere why bitgo is so popular to exchanges? whats their magic recipe? or are they just an escrow, that spares the exchanges from awaiting validation from the blockchain for every transaction?

come on, its a offshore exchange. your allegations base on the false assumption, that its a regular european/us bank or such. this is almost trolling.

thx for your answer :)

yes, thats a good plan. keep on that track. its important to go step by step. first bring the accounts online. then check the hack and what can be done about it and why and so on. and then we all take a break and only then, we start to talk about consequences, losses and so on. no need for arguing at this time. thx zanetacket :).

are you aware of this?
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:59:49
because you should first know what you are talking about, before doing the talking. thats a good rule in life. switch on brain before mouth.

would be nice to have a heads up per email 2 days before
@_date: 2016-08-06 06:19:51
so you confirm, that there was no information about implementing bitgo? i never got one. (besides: "you can see yourself in the settings").
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:46:59
thats not an argument. as well you could ask: "prove me chemtrails are not real, because i can see them".

good point, maybe they had to rollback the selling of those coins to give them to authorities?

so wtf nothing happens, all just spam?
