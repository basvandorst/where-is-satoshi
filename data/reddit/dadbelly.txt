Can I test my recovery seed for my trezor before before I put it in my safety deposit box?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:15:44
For my situation I have both mine and my dads bitcoins on my Coinbase account. I own two new Trezors. Would it be safer to keep them on separate devices or is there a way to put them all on one device and then duplicate my Trezor? I don't even know if that is an option but just a thought.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:55:18
I dont have that many coins but is it a good idea to send them slowly to my trezor? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:41:12
I'm so nervous but I think I will do this tonight. Hopefully this wont be my other bitcoin mistake of deleting my wallet with &gt;100 bitcoin on it :P
I have a mac and a PC, should I use my mac for this or does it not matter?

When I click on the receive address in the coinbase site it brings me to  (my address)   should it be blank until the first confirmation happens?
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:28:13
I would but my bitcoins are already on my trezor and I can’t find a wallet for my alts :( I don’t trust Binance AT ALL 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:00:55
Coinbase is the biggest threat to a major crash bitcoin has. We are one hack away from mass miss-trust in Bitcoin. 
If a hack occurs the average user will blame Bitcoin and call it dumb and never buy or use Bitcoin again. 
Buy a Trezor

Do people actually use GPU mining? 
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:56:04
Why is that the general consensus? The 4975 crowd follows bottom lines in TA. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:09:08
Your TA is flawed. Always trust in Lord Tone Vays. $4750 will mark the end of the bear market and anything above that is just prolonging the $4750 low.

Go all in YOU WONT YOU WONT
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:06:09
Bottom is 4975
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:55:33
The regulators will waltz with the highest bidder.
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:39:24
The next and most important step that you can do in mass adoption is getting paid from your job in BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:00:30
Up and up and down... We need to bottom at 4,750 to stop this madness. You people are way too optimistic. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:12:48
I would say the only reason it isn’t is if you are going to have to deal with the irs from selling in the short term. Also buy more - just don’t eat for a few days 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:09:00
Hummm. Does this make my Trezor less secure at all? I am interested but skeptical.
@_date: 2018-05-06 06:18:15
MMMM that looks really good!
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:52:55
This is fantastic for bitcoin if you believe that the government wants bitcoin to succeed.
This will result in misguided regulation created by misinformed politicians.
@_date: 2018-08-28 04:27:50
You mean 4975. Remind yourself to look at this post when it bottoms there.

If I have a Trezor, and I do a recovery on a second Trezor, are the coins still accessible on the first Trezor?
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:48:57
Bitcoin is worse off since everyone starting doing TA.

How do we 51% attack these alts to get rid of the noise and refocus on btc?

Download Bitcoin Core

Put it all on a trezor and buy a safety deposit box
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:58:21
Love the app! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:04:12
Are there other types of coins? :) seems like a distraction from the real coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:55:39
Do you need to report trading crypto to crypto or only report if you do crypto to USD?

Now that Coinbase controls the on and off ramps, do you think they will lobby against p2p transfers (i.e. localbitcoins)
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:38:27
Is it for the watch face or do I need to open the app every time?
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:25:29
I mined bitcoin on bitcoin core back in the day. Too bad I lost it all... all 125 coins....

Why the hell don't people use ant miners? Is buying graphics cards an excuse to their wife to build a gaming computer?

I tested it twice just now before updating :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:19:44
After my calculations I really only owe ~$90. I was more curious on the concept and how exactly I do this.
Technically if I take the check that my Roth sent me if I deposit it in my checking and then deposit in Coinbase do I still get hit on that ~$90?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:34:40
Thank you!

Hey remember when we thought futures would send us to the moon? ��

ETFs are not designed for you. Even though a large firm owning BTC on a trezor is safer than an ETF, perception of security is more important than reality. 
2 situations where BTC is stolen...
Situation 1: Investing firm owns coins with a trezor and a few disgruntled employees steal them all.
Situation 2: Investing firm invests into an ETF and the ETF crashes because of some internal theft. 
In situation 2, the investing firm is going to take far less heat because they are removed from the theft.

If only the answers were instant when BTC was at $5,100 :)

You guys are gonna call me dumb but I liquidated my Roth IRA. It was a small amount maybe 2k worth. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:25:09
Is naming my Trezor my name + phone number dumb?
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:39:28
$7,750, $8,500, $10,000 and $12,000
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:55:01
If I just logged into my trezor but only used the password to go onto the website am I still safe ?! I didn’t type in the recovery seed 
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:51:46
Great show!
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:08:10
Did you use credit or debit?
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:10:07
Did you have to identify yourself for the purchase?

I wonder how many shitcoins are lobbying hard for the law to go in their unregistered security favor
