Yes, but those addresses are under the hackers control, no? Or at the very least, these addresses will eventually lead to some other addresses and "pool up" there for purchases or currency exchanges, or this could happen directly after mixing no?

I guess it would be rude not to say something. I love the bitcoin. For me it's an opportunity, just like a lot of other people I guess. But unlike *some  unnamed members of the bitcoin community* I take the high road...I am...part of the bitcoin market! *queue shock and awe*. 
The bitcoin isn't going anywhere, so I figure I might as well get my cards in order now. I'm still mining away (I've made maybe 5btc total ever in donations) and yet I haven't released anywhere but bitcoin, which includes turning down or at least disappointing a few small labels.
I also have an album out now on coindl
I hope you will find some enjoyment from my work.

I'm betting on future investment. I get about 500mhash right now, and I'll have another ~330 mhash when I get my hd5850 going. Going into the winter, it's also a nice source of warmth.
Some day in the future, it might be worth it to get .10btc here and there right now. I'm definitely operating at a loss for now.

Thanks! I'm glad you enjoyed it. I've actually got a lot more stuff...a lot on the table that's not on that album. I've considered making a big release but I want to get quantity as well as quality. A good example of that would be DJ Shadow's The Private Press or Endtroducing. These are two great albums that will make your day today if you so choose, and if you're anything like me you'll replay them your entire shift. So I guess what I'm saying is my next album will be in the shop for a while, I think.

This is not necessarily the case. While virii may automatically steal the files, the process of loading the files and stealing funds is most likely to be done manually, I'd imagine. After all, is it just going to automatically steal the maximum amount? What if the account holder has 3 billion BTC? A giant transfer like that would attract a huge amount of attention.
I usually send it to myself (at a new addy) after I get a virus and clean my system. I guess its actually useful maybe?

To me, this proves that the bitcoin works. It is a currency, and I can provide a product (music) and receive something back for it. Not just black markets, but ones that we create for ourselves. Long live the BTC, thank you fine sir!

@_date: 2012-05-10 12:14:37
Yeah, but that's gimmicky. It's about quality. I try to make the best music I can, and what's that on my page with thousands of listens? A bitcoin address and a suggestion to donate. It's been there for months. I've made 4.6 bitcoins this way, and bitcoins are the only way I have ever (or likely will in the near future) attempt to make money through my music.
So thanks for your kind comments. Bitcoin is a dream technology, excuse me while I stack my chips on it out of lack of faith in any of the existing bullshit mediums (in the world of music or currency). I'm a rebel. Where are my other rebels at?

After my [last post]( got some attention, I really started thinking about putting together a longer, more mature album. I really wasn't expecting to sell many albums, and most of my BTC have come from mining still (I'm up to about 800mhash). But I just want to convey that it is legitimately *exciting* to participate and kick tunes for bitcoin. After playing some silent hill 2 and getting some work done, I opened up FLStudio and made the linked track. A longer version of it (without the semi-satirical bitcoin ending) will probably be on the album.
Happy holloween, and cheers :)

Wikipedia has a number of layers and practices. You can't ignore their many spam/defacement/automation handling processes, of which TOR is most likely a criteria and for good reason - those IP's are high in malicious behavior. I'm not saying it's great, but antisocial browsing is still antisocial browsing - someone is bound to shun you to prevent malign behavior.
@_date: 2012-10-03 16:59:24
I'm sorry you feel that way. Personally, I feel that there's ten times more discussion about con artists and malign figures in the bitcoin community right now than there is for legitimate uses of the currency. And really, that makes sense. The bitcoin is a bit of a digital wild west. The number one hang-up anybody has talking about bitcoin is when it comes to the prevalence of legitimate services. Whether you like it or not, I think most people would agree that what I'm doing is good for the bitcoin. I certainly feel it is. I'm normalizing it, taking advantage of it, instead of taking advantage of *you.* This is what bitcoin needs.

Can you provide details on the actual cpu or gpu share you are utilizing? Is this your botnet, an "in the know" botnet, or a rented botnet? In the second and third cases, other activity besides your mining may be taking place (needn't be said what), which doesn't exactly complicate your moral dilemma as you understandably have little control over the activity of others. Regardless, association with the means bears some careful consideration independent of your own intent. Even if it is your botnet, it could be hijacked by others and used to perpetrate far worse activity. Finally, the share of physical resources you are utilizing is the most important factor. You're at a rate of .69 BTC an hour with a 5000 host botnet, which gives us .000138 BTC an hour per host. This might not seem very significant, but this is actually fairly aggressive at current difficulties if you are using cpu mining. With GPU mining, assuming you have not targeted a group with above-average GPU's, this is less aggressive but you are very unlikely to tweak each parameter per host so I figure that the exact impact/footprint will vary widely - in short, you cannot predict how this is affecting people (by my estimation), and you are likely mining bitcoins at a less-than-negligible expense to others.

Deepbit and mtgox only get small transaction percentages, and for many hoarders coins never reach mtgox or pools with transaction fees. I'd say these two account for only a small part of a very profitable upper echelon which rears its beautiful head every once and a while and triggers value to leap in the market. Plus, you have to remember that the primary acting force here isn't even hoarders...It's most likely going to be a wealthy individual who does his homework and sees a worthy risk. At $15, a large buy to juxtapose a dimished supply would trigger a wave of selling to increase value. Then, people would sell as the value drops a bit more. Some would hold on to coin hoping for another bounce, some would sell to get what they can. And before you know it there's another rally. Then it enters a trough until excitement dies down and the cycle repeats. Humans have short memories, hot heads and varying pitstops on the learning curve of any new concept. So long as it keeps growing functionally unimpeded, it will gain trust and larger markets. More hoarders, too. There's always openings for new hoarders, even if they're hoarding bitpennies. Any micro-amount saved is a detraction from the active market and it adds up quickly to where these effects can take form.

It will succeed if it has the merit to do so. Pretending like there is a magical fix for users who are naturally bad at computers is a joke. My original point is that no change made to the client or architecture will fix this - people overall will eventually become more knowledgeable and take security into their own hands which is really the only way since *axioms do not change for people*. *People change to axioms*.

There were several. Look up Jacob Appelbaum's tweets claiming a nameless "vulnerability" in bitcoin protocol which he failed to identify of give any specific information about. Just vague disinfo in the midst of a price lapse, given Wikileaks (and by some extension, Appelbaum's) support of bitcoins.
That and I saw several blogs which proclaimed legislation had been proposed outlawing bitcoin, though no source was cited and no research on my part was able to identify anything matching the description.
@_date: 2011-06-15 03:27:44
Ok, I know you really want to prove me wrong here, but look at it this way. I start X bitcoin insurance company. My focus is bitcoin computer security. My responsibility is to hold on to your wallet files and manage your addresses. You initiate transactions through me alone, which I am responsible for confirming, and I give you all of the information regarding your account without you actually using your account locally. The only party with access to initiate transactions from your wallet is me, and I am contractually responsible for the security of those transactions, thus making me responsible if there is a security failure. 
How then, would it be possible for any beneficiary with coverage to commit such fraud? Indeed, if anything went wrong I would be contractually obligated to compensate you - thus, the very nature of insurance to begin with. Since the customer only has indirect access, there is no point of failure but my own.
Bitcoins are so vastly superior to the current monetary systems, I could throw these models around all day.

@_date: 2011-06-15 03:43:03
Encryption wouldn't solve this problem. With user-level access an attacker can send transactions at will by accessing input functions.
Security means safety in either case. Which is the users responsibility unless there's some sort of insurance model. See the bottom of this thread for one such model:
@_date: 2011-06-14 23:04:42
If you have to be careful what you do with your wallet in real life, why can't you be careful in your day to day computing activity? I'm sorry, but 80% of the people on the internet are just this: fucking stupid.
Good security practices like NOT executing the pdf from a strange email address shouldn't be that damn hard. Windows is only insecure if the user gives it stupid, stupid input or runs stupid, stupid out of date programs.
In real life, you wouldn't see someone walking around with their wallet taped to their back. It's not a technological defect if most people can't avoid the digital analog.

Nope. This is really no more intuitive than the novel notion of keeping your money in a locked box. Whether or not people have learned to think of the internet as a dimensional space for which there *is* a common sense is irrelevant to bitcoin as a technology. Change and adaptation is commonplace in any system, as are learning curves, and we aren't to fault bitcoin for fundamental axioms that *won't change for people*, when it's inevitable that people will eventually change *to those axioms.*
So stop fighting common sense.
@_date: 2011-08-26 06:26:07
This also highly depends on the robustness of the system, which again depends on its level of adoption.

Let's say you have a key to access root on your hardened gentoo build with pax and proc protections and stack protections and just about anything you want to configure for it.

Interesting read. I don't think power consumption will be a problem as circuits are getting smaller and less wasteful of energy over time. Smaller circuit = less resistance = less heat = less wasted energy. Eventually we may see circuits made of monolayer carbon (graphene) which have 0 heat release due to the quantum hall effect. These may be printed for CPU/GPU dies in the next 20-40 years.
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:46:18
I've been thinking about it and in most cases they probably can. The question is how far the mass surveillance extends. End to end network data would have to be observed which requires both (A)client and (B)server to exist within specific geographic areas that the surveillance web (pattern matches, triggered network pcaps) extend to. This would leave the TOR hops negligible as a target subject (resource or user) could have unique data which are within match criteria. This could be anything exchangeable on a network, such as a username, email address, sender/recipient ID's, specific web resource names or response codes - which could be matched and allow two ends of an exchange to be simultaneously observed independent of actual end to end path.
*edited due to accidental fail on the first line (hypothesis) - to further clarify, A and B are not in reference to the tor hops but the ultimate starting and terminating points of the connections.

I think I should mention that it doesn't matter what someones credentials are. This is sort of a false equivalence thing, someone can have credentials and be wrong. The best way to go about it (on the internet or anywhere else) is to focus on sourced information. What's the source, how reliable is the source, what do other sources say. If you can't be academic in an internet discussion, you can't be academic anywhere. Whether or not you have an honorific before your name does not make the veracity of your claims any more resolute.

Most people unfortunately over generalize this issue. They seem to think it's all about "what can we do to secure wallet.dat?" In reality, the question is "what can we do to better secure **our computers**?"
If malware has user-level access, just hijack the send funds function of the bitcoin client and send all their funds to your own address. Malware could be written to do this easily. People need to think about keeping malware off of their computers entirely, and that means not running out of date software and regularly checking to see if your computer has picked up electronic AIDS.

Those who recall the $30 peak will remember that it plateaued at 14-15 for at least a week before suddenly rising due to increased demand. The price had remained flat so supply was in people hoarding their coins. The juxtaposition of a large buy sent the price through the roof. I have a feeling the same is about to happen again.

Actually, it's not in reference to the gold rush at all. It's a reference to the societal adoption of gold as a currency period, in the many different regions and timelines in which that occurred.
And yes, before gold, livestock and beans were common vehicles for trade.
I just don't think there's near enough justification for commotion when such a large percentage of computer enthusiasts haven't even adopted bitcoin...It's in very early stages and developers will come to it with or without people claiming the sky is falling.
@_date: 2011-07-09 12:29:36
You are really forgetting fundamental dynamics here. BTC minted does not equate to BTC on the market, which is what really effects value. Savings are a fundamental part of economics. You will learn in any economics class that savings do not factor into market dynamics so long as they are saved. Hoarders collect and save. Hoarders receive most of the existing bitcoins out of belief in the model and belief in their investments. I'd imagine most involved in bitcoins don't depend on them for income either, so aside from a few daytraders and autospenders, there's not much going on in the market until crests and troughs. Currently, we're in a trough, and demand will soon outpace supply as more and more see less reason to immediately trade their coin (such as diminished returns). This places the market in a prime spot for a large buy, which...as history has shown already again and again in the bitcoin model...will cause the value to jump exponentially.
It's called deflation.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:50:49
Yes, but the key difference you're missing here is that if your wallet file gets stolen, you really have no one to blame but yourself (for poor security practices, even common sense ones and not having suitable backups). 
If your identity is stolen, you have the bank to blame if they were socially engineered, or the paper trail containing whatever information  was used to steal it, or the government for keeping your SSN on publicly available paperwork, or yourself for falling for a phishing scheme. And no, it is never so easy to get your identity back, there are people whose lives have been destroyed who have fought for years to prove that their information was abused.
See the difference? I don't think personal accountability for bitcoins is a bad thing. I think it's a great thing. No one else has their fingers on them.
@_date: 2011-07-09 11:44:46
Actually, I think he may have a point. The more people that hold on to their bitcoins, the lower supply becomes. Once the supply drops adequately in the coming month or so where there's not much to do with bitcoins but wait and see what happens, someone will post a large buy and it will drive the value upwards. Then, the more cashing in will increase supply greatly and cause fluctuation in value, the delta of which can be capitalized on. The cycle will repeat. Thus the incredible dynamics of bitcoin, still yet to be fully proven but moving in the right direction so far.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:08:32
Wow, really? it's that difficult to switch personal responsibility for your resources from a bank which digs into your money whenever it pleases to taking care of your own funds?

Yes, but your statement revolves around the idea that some kind of bitcoin insurance won't at some point exist. There's nothing to prevent it.
My argument revolves around the idea that a system where easily obtainable information can compromise your life and livelihood because there are so many hops between you and your money is laughably outmoded by bitcoin technology.

Seriously. The internet and internet security isn't going to change for anyone. This isn't even about bitcoin at this point. This is about you saying "someone needs to make this easier for everybody" when that viewpoint makes no logical sense. Computer science isn't going to change for people, eventually people will change to better work with computers. Until then bitcoin is simply ahead of its time and what you're suggesting won't ever really come to pass.
This is just dumb. Most people that are using bitcoin are dumb and are getting hacked because they are easy prey. You're waiting out some kind of superfluous client updates that will protect people that won't ever happen or a bank or a device to serve a secure function. Even then, if the person is stupid with computers it won't help much.
I don't usually keep going with threads like this. I simply suggest that the bitcoin community stops making itself look like fools. This is just proof positive that even a large percentage of this "technical" community is clueless about why they are so easy to steal from.

I don't understand your reasoning. Bitcoins increase in value. The more bitcoins you have, the more bitcoin increasing value you have. It's exponential, which is one hell of an incentive.
Money losing value isn't really a good argument for loans or investing. It's a good argument for putting yourself at the top and hoarding more of other peoples money.

Since we're talking security here, I might as well chime in. A few points, if you will.
* Encryption of the wallet file won't really help things if the user-level is compromised. This allows them to execute transfers at will using bitcoin client functions. 
* If we're talking windows, privesc is **always** trivial. 
* If the bitcoin client were just running through files on the local system scanning it for nasty looking things, you might as well sell it as an antivirus client! It won't even know it's been triggered to send a transaction until it's already executed it, and it won't care because it might as well have been the user for all it can tell.
* On Unix systems, privesc is a little more tricky but a 15 minute brute force or a significant rainbow table attack on /etc/shadow will usually knock it up to root pretty quickly on most boxen. This isn't even counting intercepting keystrokes or finding key files, which a lot of users mishandle.
* What we need are centralized, secure analogues to banks, insured and secured by professionals in physically restricted locations. Or, everyone can be personally responsible and keep their machines secure. One good idea is to have a system you use just for transactions. Leave it disconnected from the internet until it's time to sell. Add funds to it regularly from your mining or buying activities via flash drive. This would be a very difficult thing to crack outside of physical "intervention."
Overall, I don't think the amount of knowledge necessary to keep yourself safe using Bitcoins is much greater than the instinct of keeping your wallet safely in your pocket, instead of out where anybody can grab it. In my opinion, it'll take a few people burning their hands to realize that the oven is hot before the rumor that red glowing things are painful teaches people not to do it. Security is always in the users hands. 
Thank you for your time :)

The fact that it was created in the database means it was not functional. They were escaped attempts on protected variables, and the attempts on escaping using different encodings look to have failed too. Nevertheless, there may have been a successful attempt on a different input vector on the site. The site also may have been vulnerable to blind sql injection due to the mtgox error handler demonstrated earlier on r/bitcoin which, if able to represent a true/false state in result of a query, could have led to enumeration of the database.

Hoarding does protect your investment. By hoarding you restrict available supply to the market. This allows demand to outstep supply which drives value (people want them, but there are fewer out on the market than there are buys for coins). Think about it. Those possessing btc want to sell at a high value to make the most. When we've had a high like $30+, why sell at $15 if you're in to make the most out of your investment? The system has fluctuated successfully for months and months now. That it will increase again is not news to serious holders of coin.

**EDIT** You really don't deserve it but I'll obliterate another one of your points - no, not everyone *can* buy everything with their credit card. Most people are like me and scrape by. Bitcoin is *purchasing power*. When I have bitcoin, I order myself a pizza with bitcoin.

I made this point a looong, long time ago. Encrypted wallets don't really mean anything. The only thing you can count on is your own individual security practices.

I know exactly what you mean. I thought about giving bitcoin too, but it should be the other way around or it perpetuates the idea that our music isn't valuable, and perhaps that bitcoin isn't either ("hey, they need to pay YOU to listen to their music!"). The cool thing about bitcoin is that it's really simple to do. I put a btc address next to my tracks on soundcloud, partly to confirm who I am and partly to rep bitcoin, but mostly so generous folk can show me love. This is the driving engine of bitcoin.
I think it's mostly a mentality thing. I actually had someone recently suggest that I was *begging* for bitcoins for announcing my June 29th album, and told me to head to This is the kind of "non-market" thinking that will destroy bitcoin if there isn't a general mentality change and re-affirming that bitcoin is meant to be a currency, not speculative.
The only way on our end to do that is to offer our work for bitcoin and have donations as an option.
It's a fairly complex thing to take head-on, but maybe the idea will get around. And, of course, this is why we need more good ideas!

Well, I think it's more an issue that if someone has executed user-level code, (e.g. keylogger) they are also capable of writing code to run bitcoin-qt and send x address all your btc with the windows api. The keylogger was just so I had another example. And for instance a roommate can also simply send themselves a transaction using physical access by using the client. I haven't used bitcoin-qt's encryption either so I don't know if a password entry point when executing the bitcoin client or opening it up from idle would help, or if this is already a 'thing' when encryption is enabled, but maybe that's not a bad idea.

I also use Bitcoin-Qt and I have a question about wallet encryption. I'm sure it makes stealing a wallet *slightly* more difficult, but I've always felt there will be ways to do anything from hijacking the windows API and sending from the client directly to steal funds to, maybe more obviously, keylogging. Do you feel that 'wallet encryption' is possibly more to satiate peoples misgivings about their personal security practices than it is to prevent btc from being stolen, or maybe that its even a bit *harmful* because it makes people feel like their btc are safe when in reality, if they fall for a malicious pm or an out of date browser exploit, it's still in the air? E.g that more emphasis should be placed on keeping software up to date, not falling for tricks/bad links/etc, than encryption accessibility, as realistically, malware has no need to grab/decrypt the file at all.

Yeah, that's an interesting bit of debate. But let's keep old world allegories out of the picture for now - the internet just has too many goods and services toward which this isn't an issue (a web host has no need to ship a hosting account...likewise for entertainment and a myriad of other services). 
So, from the supply side, what you're saying isn't really an issue because people piggyback on the stability of USD. It just really isn't a realistic concern that any business operating with bitcoin would need to worry about. Order with USD, sell for btc, keep profit and save as desired. If the BTC rug suddenly falls out from under you, you have alternative markets in which to sell the product (the fair-trade value of the product is the same - someone out there will pay with USD, you aren't likely to be completely at a loss and if you've operated your merchant service intelligently you'll stay profitable anyway).
No, that's not something I expect to happen forever, but let's not deny that this exists and is a fundamental part of "bit-business." There isn't much risk to order the camera because you can always sell it for USD anyway or cash in a percent of your coins at sale.
So, moving on, let's look at the future. In five years, do you expect bitcoin will be as unstable as it is now? The argument you're making hinges on the theory that it will be wildly unstable and that value will suddenly depreciate.  It's a hypothetical "rug out from under you" what-if. The point of my original post was that, unless bitcoin suddenly stops having it's one of a kind momentum and utility (such as a major fault or interruption) there's no reason that should happen. Because it is easier. It is better. People can +tip anyone for anything anywhere - say I want that lamp in your room. Admit it, for 100btc, you'd sell me that lamp, and I don't need to look at my bank account or log in to paypal or find out your paypal address. Suddenly you have money waiting in your orangered and *do you see what I mean?* No one says no to money in their proverbial orangered. This is the engine that drives bitcoin.
Let's see where it goes. There's a reason it's experimental - but I don't believe that there will be any cause for concern among people selling Camera's for bitcoin any time soon. The situation for them and virtually all bitcoin businesses is much the same - profitable, viable. Which will keep 'em coming for a long time.
**EDIT** I'll add that re-reading the above post it doesn't make much sense anyway. Suddenly it will only sell for 16btc because btc *deflated?* I'm not sure what this means. If it went up in value so that the fair-trade value of the camera sells for fewer coins, then that means the coins are worth more. I'm just kind of scratching my head now, no offense.

A better response is that you don't have to *buy* anything to be a bitcoin holder. As such, it doesn't require you to "enter" anything (pyramid scheme it is not.) You can make a witty comment on reddit and receive a tip via a completely automated tip bot, anywhere, without even having the bitcoin program installed. You can be a guy who makes interesting content or a charity organization for kids with learning disabilities and receive donations. You can be a musician and release an album, and market it a bit, even receive tips to cover some of the costs of being a guy who makes music. You can sell computer hardware to the niche market of btc holders, pizzas, you name it, all in the name of good business and providing something that people *want.* Not everybody is rich in fiat, and btc is a source of wealth because of its sheer conceptual advantage, and people *want* purchasing power, as much as they want USD/insert currency here. I've ordered a few pizzas from pizzaforcoins.com. Do I feel bad about it? Not really, the pizza was nice, and at the rate of ~$60 I don't feel like I lost anything. In the end I still have net gain. The difference isn't that bitcoin is a stock, it's that bitcoin is an *economy*. I confess I have never bought a bitcoin up until recently, as a musician and on-again-off-again miner. So, maybe your answer is that there are bitcoin hoarders, increasing scarcity, there are bitcoin spenders, who make fair trades at market rate and expect nothing else, bitcoin receivers who mine through good times and bad or provide some sort of product/service, and bitcoin speculators, who buy coins. I find it fascinating when out of the diversity of the subject matter, something like "pyramid scheme" could even get thrown around. If I had bought 500 bitcoins at $30 in 2011, I'd still be holding a large amount of purchasing power today, regardless of the peak then. Whether or not this factoid attracts speculators is ultimately not consequential to bitcoin itself. Likewise, even if we saw a crash, bitcoin is still in stages of early adoption. Early adopters can choose to handle their BTC as they so please, be that saving it or spending it in flurries of random reddit tips. It really doesn't matter which they do; there will probably come a point in bitcoin market maturity that they will be far wealthier men than they are today, or at least *we can assume* that is their mental wager.

it's really...uh...telling, how when the price went up, everyone wished they had bought at $1-$20, wished to hell they had, would have taken a time machine back in time to do it. and now that it's $50, everything is gloomy and threatening. I'm not terribly concerned, because that's the risk. nobody knows the future, but a reality exists where you'd give your right leg to come back to this moment and lay a few k on it.

I'll add that customer protections extend to reputation-based systems: I can safely do business with pizzaforcoins.com because everyone knows you spend your btc, you get some pizza. If it didn't go down that way, you've got a public ledger *everyone* can use to see that people are getting ripped. 
There may be advantages/disadvantages but it's far from a deal breaker: reputable businesses can operate, and customers can avoid risk through perhaps more organic means than "chargeback!"

Doesn't this to a degree leave it vulnerable to say, executing the function to maximize bitcoin.exe, emulate a click on send, and emulating some keystrokes to the attackers address? I'm not trying to be critical of the clients security, just pointing out what can be done on a majority of hosts assuming user-level access is obtained, common environments, etc. I think those using encryption might prefer more frequent locking, such as requiring an unlock after minimizing or completing a task. Not trying to be critical just observing. There have been a few cases I've seen of encrypted wallets being bypassed and keylogging probably isn't the easiest vector for immediate extraction of wallets, as usually hackers will go for the quickest, least effort vector and maximize spread. I don't think my .2btc is worth much but I'm honored to have a chance to give it! I hope I'm not too far off the mark.
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:45:50
It does seem somewhat relevant but I don't see how those numbers could possibly be even close to correct, as the network features a wide assortment of hardware, some much more efficient than others. You also have to consider that many would have servers or computers running in those spaces anyway. Power usage per computational performance is constantly improving as well. The question is ultimately whether BTC could scale to a banks level of transactions without power usage actually reaching a significant level.
@_date: 2013-07-22 20:57:45
Could it be that you have done nothing in regard to fund returns? o_O the website lists a process for you to go through and states a timeframe. Im confused as to why you don't seem to even be trying their outline, no offense.

Money? Where? Do you represent a label? The truth is, bitcoin makes it easier than anything else in existence. I dont see a bandcamp release getting taken too seriously. Whereas there is an eager, enthusiastic crowd ready to support artists like me among bitcoiners. I think I'd have a fair amount of trouble finding a profitablr niche among more commercial mediums.
**EDIT** Well it looks like bandcamp has grown a lot lately. Nevertheless, I refuse to use paypal and it's the only payment service they allow, so hey, here I am!

As a musician going through the most difficult financial time in the last 2 years for me, I am *still* holding on to the BTC I've made from my music with an iron fist. It's almost all I've got now.

I don't have to own bitcoin to see that you are of below average intellect. But I do.
@_date: 2013-02-07 08:17:03
Thanks. Yeah, sorry I didn't make my point very well. I wish it was as simple as "choosing" to make USD with my music. Unfortunately, that is highly unrealistic as I know virtually no one who successfully profits from their music through normal channels. I wish there was a simpler point of integration from "musician" to "consumer"...But I guess that's where Bitcoin comes in. How can I argue with a $225 million dollar market cap, when my dream would come true from a millionth of that? How can I argue with someone giving me the equivalent of a "street tip" with a few keystrokes? It's magic, man. And everything I do counts to make sure that magic keeps happening, even making music just for release on coindl/bittracks. 
**EDIT** Lovecraft barely made any money throughout his life because publishers would pay him a pittance - somewhere around $200-$300 per novel. He died a poor man. In 40 years, if I can see a world where no true artist dies a poor man because *technologies* exist to put their own money in their own hands, I'll be happy. If I can help usher that in, I'll be even happier.

I really really like this, and thanks. I am gonna try and do this with my album. The only question I'm having trouble with is where to send a portion of the btc to.
I'm suggesting [SPICES]( found from the bitcoin list of donation organizations. It can't be easy to be a kid with learning disabilities.
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:56:17
It can happen! 
A while ago, I did an experiment. I had been receiving bitcoin in donations and sales steadily but the price rose to $10-$20 or so, and I posed the question "do donations/sales still happen when the price is *high*?"
The answer suggested, which I agreed with, was that yes, but people donate *smaller* amounts of btc, rather than no btc, in relation to the market price. This was true, I still got donations and sales...
What I've been seeing lately is activity drying up, which is what I feared. People don't realize that artists, businesses, etc, are just as happy receiving 0.05 btc today as they were receiving 0.5btc yesterday. 
So, my point is, don't hand me all your btc in your wallet! Those are for you, man! hand myself or another artist some *small* fraction of it. If we can re-gain the mentality of being more market than money-machine, if we can prove that artists can be successful with bitcoin as their backbone, (I'm not saying that's me but I'd love to be your champion), then iTunes accepting bitcoin is in the future.

Holy crap. Will provide pic with beer! It feels like *fucking magic* to essentially have just moved an album over the internet just because someone "can." I've been noticing money not go directly to artists since I was a kid cause it *couldnt*. Dont know where you live, but it is really cool to participate in providing a product for an experimental currency. Im dropping an album soon and excited about it, if you frequent this sub or use coindl/bittracks keep an eye out and thanks for your support.

From a business point of view, I don't understand many of the points I see brought up by economists. I can buy a pizza with so few bitcoins, *fewer than yesterday* I think should be the operative phrase here, I'm gonna buy that pizza (let's say 0.1btc today, 0.5btc a week ago). As long as the pizza scales to a degree with the current price, I'm going to be *happy* spending that. Because I'm getting some pizza I wouldn't have gotten if this internet currency hadn't blown up. I made my btc through selling my music and music-related donations, which is pretty awesome in and of itself and I feel unworthy of the awesomeness I'm watching unfold. New businesses are going to spring up and happily take btc for services because btc has increasing worth (a lot already have and I'm sure more are moving every day). More attraction brings more speculation (read: people wanting that spending power at current market rate, buys). Bitcoin is spiking out in a thousand unpredictable avenues and there's no rule saying a price of $150, or $1000, is really a bad thing. Let's say some people like my music and send me 0.05 btc where they would have once sent 0.2 btc...do you see what I mean? It's moving fast, but at no point does a reasonably judged fair trade cease to exist - if I'm hungry I'll spend 0.1btc for a pizza, even if 0.05btc will get me a pizza *tomorrow*. 
I'd wager a large part of the reason why this bloom is happening is because a lot of people out there holding btc are happy to spend 0.1 for a pizza. Or an album. Or a donation. They realize, "hey, we have purchasing power in this emerging online economy" and they use it, and a fair trade happens or the spender doesn't spend. I rock a tune or post a witty comment, someone on the internet shows me love with a +tip. Nothing else can really fuck with that. (paypal? banks? credit cards? god no).
**EDIT** I'd add that bitpay is looking increasingly awesome and *present, assured* value does exist within a relatively short resolution - it's simple. You have 90% go straight to the exchange at current market price, you have 10% or whatever amount you choose stored for ideally, appreciation. If it depreciates? Well, how strong is your hand? You're free to sell them to me.
**EDIT 2** Let's say it crashes. Does that make the demand for them, their utility and potential, go away? People would snag them up, because they're neat and shiny and can buy you things (more things as usefulness increases) so long as the system remains and operates without major fault. Usefulness is a measure of "where can you spend it" and there's no shortage of people popping up to fill those roles. I just fail to see any snag with it. I read a lot of these threads and, I would hope anyway, that bitcoin is a bit of a [black swan]( in that we have no idea what kind of peak it could actually stabilize at, or what mechanisms would cause destabilization - it appears this is purely a matter of human psyche transposed with the fundamental *need*, even *want*, of something different/better than the current model. Somewhat of a paradigm shift, maybe.
