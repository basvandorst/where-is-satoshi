What is actually the problem with having 2 "bitcoins" instead of one. One can be that super decentralized 1 mb or whatever , high fee, high security bitcoin for settlements and the other will be unlimited or adjustable block size for daily usage. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:35:52
First point - of course.
Second point - if the country of greece starts buying billions worth it will cause a ripple effect and all the traders will go insane. The price will rise and they can finally get some money if they play it right. Is greek economy even bigger than the big banks?

Merchant adoption is not  very important either at this point. Thousands of businesses accept it, but nobody is buying anything. Bitcoin at present is a speculative vehicle and not much else. We are still waiting for bitcoin 2.0 apps to make bitcoin really blow up.

You implying bitcoin costs a lot of money. It doesn't. 1 dollar worth of bitcoin still gets you 1 dollar worth of bitcoin. Vice versa. If you earning a dollar a day, you can buy 10 cents worth of bitcoin and transact with that. You don't need to buy "whole" units of bitcoin, boy.

despite my cynical and sarcastic comment, both blockchains are very similar and can facilitate the same transactions. Dogecoin has lower fees, though. If you care that much about cheap microtransactions, maybe you should not use bitcoin. 
Only problem with dogecoin is its not as easy to get or cash out..

"Nowhere, though, are more money and resources being spent on the technology than on Wall Street — the very industry that Bitcoin was created to circumvent."
Stopped reading here. This is exactly what made me stop buying bitcoin and i am losing interest very fast. 
These cocksucking banks are taking bitcoin will all its ideologies about freedom and fairness and just implementing it into their systems. Bitcoin will allow these monsters to suck MORE out of the people and QUICKER.
bitcoiners are sucking the banks dicks all day long. The bitlicense passed and nobody is doing anything.
Counbase is just as fucked up as your next bank. 
Plus to all you sour bagholders who will downvote me: you do understand that bitcoin at the hands of the banks will not necessarily make you rich. All you need is fractions of pennies to execute transactions. That's best case scenario since the banks and government can create their own centralized blckchains and bitcoin will become irellevant after all the preteen girls and old people start using Bank of America's new faster, cheaper "peer to peer" payment tokens or whatever the fuck its going to be called.
Unlike bitcoiners these bloodsucking evil corps can come to a concesus and can guarantee their blockchains can handle more than 3 tx per second.

Yea the authority that created bitcoin. I am referring more to the white paper. 
Everything you are regurgitating to me was also said by someone smarter than you.
I read all about lightning. Even they agree the blocksize must be raised for it to function.
It will take years to get to that 100 mb arbitrary number you just used.
Do you agree with what I said though? What made you think you will be able to run a validating node from your home computer indefinitly?

Then you use other third parties or said Coinbase to buy shit.

The simplest way for the government to shut down bitcoin would be to declare it absolutly illegal. Anyone who has any and whoever uses it will be locked up.

You don't have to be a genious to see that if you bought near or at the all time high price, you will be reluctant to spend since you will net a permanent loss.
I don't know the statistics but I got a hunch that most btc spenders are early adopters.
If the bubble never happened (thanks Gox) and the growth was more organic, holders would be breaking even or having some gains, then they would spend, regardless of if the currency is deflationary or not.

As much as you don't want to admit it, bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and spawned lots and lots more. Some of these cryptos are arguably better, and it is disingenuous to say otherwise. 
They don't have the network effect or hardcore following, but some coins offer much more than bitcoin. 
I am not pumping shitcoin clones but rather saying that there are very smart people developing interesting things and to dismiss them all because they are not the original is not right.

Bitcoins cheap value transfer are sure great but with this debacle about thw block size how soon until the fees go up 10x ? 
Transactions are increasing sure. Is commerce through bitcoin increasing or is it still one occasional guy buying something here and there? The blockchain is a great piece of technology but its just not catching on for commerce and the rising fees because of the block limit will destroy bitcoins long time promise of almost free transactions. Agreed?
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:45:23

how can it be possibly good in person if you have to wait 24 hours for your transaction to clear? Bitcoin is good for store of value (sometimes) and as settlement layer. Soon the fees will make it far from nearly free to use. Would you spend bitcoin when the fee is like $2?

I don't know where you live, OP, but neither me or anyone else I know is worried about inflation diminishing our money on a daily or even yearly basis. I am in Canada. We are all aware it exists.

I understand that and agree with everything you are saying. This year I realized bitcoin's future is to be an expensive and secure settlement layer. Not really a peer to peer low cost network. Unfortunate.

Previous spikes were happening when bitcoin was small and exciting. There was lower liquidy and less exchanges, less places that accepted and it was the time when news moved the price. 
Sudden movements and price fluctuations were more common. 
And then there was MtGOX with half the world trading through it. I believe after the recent news that they were manipulating the price.
All of that caused the spike. 
What can cause it now?

Bitcoin's volatility cant, by definition, decrease as it grows. More people wanting a scarce resource will increase its price - volatility. Bitcoin can't become a global reserve currency or take gold's market cap without appreciating in price. Volatility will be there, just it will be everyone's favourite volatility: upward in price.

Fuck you. You don't get it. I understand the shortcomings of colored coins very well. But by 2027 that might be figured out. 
This is what banks are trying to do. They clearly believe the actual token in the blockchain should not be valuable but you are obviously smarter than those guys, right?

How can you argue with this man? He clearly knows what he is talking about. I agree. Bitcoin needs to have bugger blocks until a silution is found and made. If his proposal is too high, miners will have the choice to make not as large blocks in the future, but, currently it is the only way.

 bitcoin is not a great medium of exchange to begin with. Its all just a novelty to use it. Might have looked like that in 2011 when bitpay launched. Not anymore. More competition now too.  Bitcoin is first and foremost an investment. 
There is absolutly no point to go fiat &gt; BTC &gt; fiat. Its redundant. Not to mention the 3 tx/s.
I have bitcoin and i'm keeping them stored so i believe in this tech and put my money where my mouth is.

I think they want people to be able to mine "virgin" satoshis which will be associated with your device/identity/product. 
And yes, you can do that with any old pc, but then you really need to know what you are doing to set up the mining, understand how it works and be able to maintain it. Your old pc pcu/gpu probably won't mine that many satoshis either.

This is good for average users. Nobody is ever worried when they trade through questrade or your other favorite place that their money will get stolen. Nobody is afraid of keeping money in the bank and using their services.  Unregulated bitcoin companies definitly turn people away, and maybe for the better. 
If you accept and handle other peoples' fiat / bitcoin you better as fuck comply with everything the banks have to. 
I am still of the opinion that banks are scum, though, so don't get me wrong.

@_date: 2015-09-25 00:57:51
They keep saying "the blockchain" - is this an arbitrary blockchain or we talking specifically bitcoin? 
Also, all you need is 1 satoshi ( plus maybe a tx fee) to transfer ownership of a trillion dollars.  Why do they say the value will go into bitcoin (if thats the case)? Bitcoin can just be the oil for the machine like 21 wants. Satoshis (or fractions of satoshis?) Can be like xrp or ether where the value is insignificant to the mechanism.

Good article. I completly agree. Bitcoin does need an increasw in the blocksize but people are dreaming that it can ever process tiny transactions indefinitly. LN or other secondary/tertiary layers will have to provide that. Bitcoin was not designed for shavings of pennies tips and buying coffee. Yes, you can do so now, but if bitcoin takes off -- forget about it. 
I personally gave up on that idea. I look at bitcoin, in its current and short term form as a solid store of value ONLY.

@_date: 2015-10-06 02:14:48
Very possible. Gox did have like 70% of all trade going through it. 
ONE thing i respect about that fat fucker is that he almost single handedly pushed bitcoin trading and awareness to great levels which didnt exist before him.

7 grams is a quarter of an ounce which is 28 grams... 
7 is not really divisible by 4 and nobody does it. The smallest "bulk" you can buy is half quarter which is 3.5 grams 
Smaller would be a 20 or 10 for 2 and 1 grams assuming 10/gram like it is here

Very sensational but bitcoin also has its powerfull elite and common plebs. Early adopters and investors with money (not to mention increasingly centralized mining, exchanges, core devs etc..) will be able to use bitcoin to their advantage more than the common pleb who can afford $10 worth.

This shit makes me think bitcoin is broken. No scaling, malleability, transactions to be dropped..
This shit makes bitcoin unreliable.
Should this be updated on bitcoin.com and all the other info sites and reddit itself:
"Global currency, send money everywhere. Low fees" .. to "global currency, send money everywhere but be ready to pay and dont worry when your transaction doesn't go through because some guys think your shit is spam for the network"

"Ooh Venezuela has cheap electricity so good for mining" - yea ok. 
They might not have done it as of now, but if and when bitcoin grows there it will be a serious threat and will be dealt with. I don't expect any progress regarding sound money or freedom to happen there before the people kick out this corrupt and ineffective government

First, the recent drop in oil prices demonstrates oil is is not in as high demand as previously thought.
Second, there has been tons of hydrocarbon discoveries even in unsuspecring places like in the Mediterrenean Sea so its not like the dwindling Saudi fields are really a concern for global supply. Cheap crude, maybe..
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:25:23
Bitpay should take note

Its because humans are toxic scum by nature. Its naive to think bitcoin would be different. I am not dogging on bitcoin but on human nature. We kill, steal, rape, lie etc. Only a serious change to society over centuries can fix this.

I completly agree. There are no real use cases for bitcoin at the moment and no reason for bitcoin to even be in the triple digits based on utility. 
"I can remit cheaper" - horseshit. You don't need bitcoin to relay the transaction. You just need to change numbers in your database. X goes in, x minus fees paid out on the other side. 
"I can save 20% on starbucks" - horseshit. Some people are pumping this shit. We are talking about bitcoin!! You want to save your 50 cents on the coffee?? Really? Thats your idea of hard money and monetary freedom? This will really help the other 6 billion people surely. 
Bitcoin is a high risk speculative investment and it runs on greed! 
The run up to $1200 was not because Chinese speculators were remitting shit to Zimbabwe or trying to save 20% on fucking coffee!

What about a service like bitpay or whatever to convert in and out directly on the site. Lets say you want to use OB but have no bitcoin. All you need is like to signup to circle or coinbase or whatever and have it synced  once you want to buy just press buy and it does it all for you  same as when a merchant wants to cash out. Hey coinbase's thing is free for first million in sales so you don't even need to really account for the fees in the price of your product when you launch.
