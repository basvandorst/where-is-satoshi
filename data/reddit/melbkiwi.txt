Mycelium is a HD wallet,  look in their FAQ at “ What does HD in HD wallet mean. 
I had the same worry with my Ledger Nano S and it was ok. 
This happened after I sent a BTC transaction, I thought I was hacked but wasn’t.

I suggest you short Bitcoin tomorrow with that belief you have going there.

I’m not criticising something I got for free. 
But I doubt nicehash send payments with 0 confirmations, although I could be wrong.

This article below ran in Australia this morning and it’s poorly written but the markets went crazy afterwards. 
Radio stations have been quoting it in 1 sentence news reports. 
The last time they ran an article here on Roger Ver saying BCC the real Bitcoin was 20 November- just before Bitcoin skyrocketed.

I think it’s an ok idea. An S9 will probably cost 0.15 BTC and projections are they will return 1.5 BTC in 2 years.

Shop.bitmain.com last time I checked they were $1415  plus $105 for a power supply.  Probably closer to 0.2 BTC when you take postage into account. 
You need to check every day or 2 until they are back in stock.

Plunges! 
Rockets, write something about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:27
What fact?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:39
It’s ok. I spend a serious amount of time searching to justify my investment in Bitcoin and there is no evidence to support selling for me yet.

Yeah. Also, so what is they took the opportunity to buy up Crypto big time before they reinstated the videos.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:32:27
Because they may have more than you!

It’s been selling over $14,500 on Coinspot which is over $11,000 US.
