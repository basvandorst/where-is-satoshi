Ok, thanks, that makes it clearer. FYI my node is specifically to support the network and is regularly updated. I set it up because I don't have the bandwidth at home but I still wanted to contribute to the network.

Unless I'm mistaken, this doesn't apply to UK-based customers, it always takes a couple of days for me to send a SEPA transfer to Kraken, and Fidor UK cannot receive international transfers at all, not yet, anyway.

IMO space on the blockchain is a scarce resource with huge value and must be allocated somehow. We can only use a) voluntary co-operation, b) command and control, or c) a price market. 
The network is too big for a, too decentralised for b, so a fee market is the most appropriate response.
A deeper issue here is that nodes (who store the blockchain data) are not compensated for providing that service. We currently do so because we get a value out of it by creating the network in the first place, but it's an inefficient market. It would be amazing if there was a way for nodes to be paid for relaying blocks but I suspect it's impossible.

I suspect they sell them using a dark pool on one of the bigger exchanges, so as not to spook the market

The existence of a time delay between a resource becoming available and people working out how to utilise it to capacity doesn't invalidate the principle.
The first article made no sense. Fees are simply transferred from one party to another so don't affect total value.
The second one I agree with, compensating nodes for their contribution to the network seems the logical solution.

Hmm. I thought I was being a good little bitcoiner by running a VPS node to verify and relay blocks, now you are saying this isn't helpful? No way I'm keeping any coin on a VPS, and I run a full node at home too so no lightweight clients to link to it. Isn't it helping the network at all? Confused!

How is that communist? 'Adapt or go bust' is the heart of capitalism. Progress is achieved through competition and technological innovation. If you don't keep up a competitor will quickly wipe you out. Bitcoin needs to innovate or one day we will see a different cryptocurrency take its place. Ignorant protectionism ultimately harms everyone.

Interesting that they won't comment on the naming of the coin just yet.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:26:26
I'm not sure what you mean by 'you people.' I am invested in bitcoin and want it to grow in utility and adoption. I just think that assuming a segwit based UASF fork will succeed simply because it is technologically superior is naive. Again, it's not about LTC specifically, that was just an example. And yes, I do hold LTC as well as BTC... and ETH, and XRP, and NEM. Only a fool keeps all his eggs in one basket and this is a new world, technologically speaking.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:47:37
This is a misunderstanding of deflation. Deflation occurs when demand outstrips supply. Gold can still be deflationary if the amount of new gold being mined is less than the demand, hence a price increase. This applies to fiat currencies and bitcoin. It's not just the nominal supply that matters.
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:53:52
Litecoin already has four times the on-chain capacity of Bitcoin AND segwit so that increases it even further. By the time there is a scaling issue I expect LN to be available. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:26:11
That's ridiculous. Cryptocurrencies have inherent technological value. A shift in market leader doesn't change that. It's not like social media went away when MySpace was replaced by Facebook. People didn't stop using mobile phones when Apple wiped out Nokia and Ericcson. Competition is a sign of a healthy market. Bitcoin's dominance is less than 50% yet the total market cap is now close to 70 billion dollars, crypto as a store of value is increasingly an accepted fact.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:50:13
I understand that Bitcoin has the potential to make finance more accessible to people in the developing world but this is irrelevant to my point as the benefits of digital currency still exist regardless of Bitcoin's monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:55:00
Tell that to MySpace shareholders.
Whether I believe in the market cap or not isn't the point. The market does. If you think you are smarter than the market then good luck to you. This is the world of technology and if you don't evolve you disappear. It's entirely possible that the 95% consensus required for bitcoin updates is a fatal design flaw that will see it slowly replaced by more adaptable coins. Or maybe not. I have no idea but I'm not going to put all my eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:52:22
You are deluded. Bitcoin is just a technology and like every other technology, it can and almost certainly will become obsolete (that's not to say the replacement can't be a new version of bitcoin–segwit is already a replacement of sorts).
Bitcoin has no value in and of itself. It only has value in the utility it provides. Something else that provides the same utility but faster, cheaper, more secure, or with added glitter for that matter can and probably will win out in the end. First mover advantage is just that, an advantage, it doesn't grant unlimited and infinite market dominance. That's a fantasy and suggests you've lost all objectivity.
It's not bitcoin that is important, it's the utility you described, decentralised, scarce, immutable etc. That cat is out of the bag, a new paradigm, a new type of money.
I suspect you are unable to see the truth here but I offer a simple prediction: even if bitcoin disappears into obscurity cryptocurrency will live on, offering not only a store of value but many new money technologies. If I'm wrong the whole market will disappear.
Or bitcoin will remain the market leader (I hope it does) with improvements and updates and this point will remain unresolved...

Bitcoin has increased in value relative to goods and services,  therefore goods and services have become cheaper - this is the definition of deflation. It's the rate of increase relative to the demand that defines whether a currency is inflationary or deflationary.
It's fairly standard economics that a (small) amount of inflation is desirable to keep an economy moving smoothly.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:13:44
I'm not defending high inflation, I accept that it is incredibly damaging to an economy. We're not anywhere near that in Bitcoin, though, and won't be so long as the supply is capped.
I'm not questioning the other properties of Bitcoin that are beneficial, just that the deflation is a potential problem. Deflation isn't just bad for borrowers, it's bad for the whole system as it discourages investment and encourages hodling (hoarding).
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:31:08
Property is an investment too. The question is whether or not you think housing will outperform bitcoin (or stocks, etc.)
I'd much rather pay a few percent interest on a mortgage and have the cash to invest somewhere with a better return. Even having a deposit tied up in a property seems like throwing money away to me.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:33:43
Computers aren't money as they have value of their own. A key feature of money (as a technology) is that it is a socialised representation of value but has no intrinsic value itself.
You buy a computer because you need a computer to do computing. Also, people DO delay purchasing decisions when they know the value of a computer is about to drop (prior to a new model being released, for example)

I lost you there... what does this subreddit have to do with my point?
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:14:23
Litecoin already has the equivalent of 4MB blocks AND segwit, not to mention faster confirmations, yet I haven't seen everyone move over there. Other coins have other technological advantages yet bitcoin remains king. The inertia in this space is huge and I don't think technical superiority is nearly as important as many would like to believe. I'd love to see segwit on bitcoin but we all need to be realistic.  
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:55:25
Congratulations on not only missing my point (which wasn't about litecoin specifically) but also being technically incorrect. Litecoin's shorter confirmation times are a feature of the coin and have nothing to do with usage. Check your facts.

The best way for a country to reduce debt is by having a growing economy as it increases tax receipts and allows debt to be repaid. While high inflation reduces the nominal debt it also damages growth. It's a balancing act, hence the 2% target of the Bank of England, for example.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:27:05
I didn't claim they do. I was pointing out that technological change can result in market leaders being supplanted without the market itself losing value, which was your original claim (without bitcoin crypto has no value)

I am using bfx short to cover my balance of btc in order to maximise the bch airdrop. I suspect many others are doing the same, hence the sudden huge increase in short positions. It doesn't necessarily mean there is a strong expectation of a drop post-fork (but it might)

The deceased don't pay inheritance tax, their beneficiaries do. So I assume what you're really asking is: 'How can *I* use bitcoin to avoid inheritance tax?' 
As far as avoidance goes (legal attempts to reduce tax exposure) then bitcoin has no advantage over fiat. It's only useful if you wish to evade tax, i.e. illegally.
Although I agree with comments above about taxation as theft it's also important to respect the rule of law so I suggest dropping the idea. Use every legal trick in the book by all means, but don't actually break the law.
For an example, let's say granny buys a load of bitcoin as an 'investment' on the advice of her kindly grandson. Then, sadly, she passes, and it appears she didn't think to include the private keys in her will. The money is presumed lost. However, sneaky grandson has a personal backup of the keys and has full access to the funds.
This is seriously criminal behaviour, you are stealing from the government and also any other potential beneficiaries. I suspect it's jailable should you be caught and any purchased coins would be easily traceable. If they were ever moved it would be immediately obvious someone had the keys. Might you get away with it? Quite possibly, although either you've conspired with other beneficiaries or you've stolen from them too, which makes it more likely you'd get caught.
Tax sucks, it's way too high and we should all campaign towards a smaller state and use every legal means at our disposal to reduce our personal exposure. But don't break the law. It penalises other tax payers and puts you at serious risk.
