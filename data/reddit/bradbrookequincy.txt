Yes thats correct. They do not matter At all over the long term. Thats why a janitor put $300 a month into stocks every month for 50 years and donated $5,000,000 to library a few years ago.  The actual only thing that works for sure in the history of the stock market is complete diversification across all types companies, reits, international, emerging markets and bonds and forgetting about it and not reading headlines and rebalancing on the ups and downs. Best done with etfs and no load mutual funds.

Your trying to be an economist and time the market.  It does not work. Under your premise I should pull my money out. I won't and I never have and its over 4x what I have put into the market and I have been through every correction losing 20-35 percent of my money rebalancing and riding it to new highs.

I have 25 rental properties. And a good chunk in the market the last 15 years. My networth is up 4x over that period. The reason a janitor recently gave $5,000,000 to a library is because 1. He was not scared. 2. He religiously bought stocks each month over 50 years. Stock market = wildy diversified portfolio of no load mutual funds and bonds. 20-30 year timeline.  Real estate - just one good property can be a retirement nest egg that someone else pays for.

Dont buy Bitcoin as an investment. Its akin to investing in your friends new business. Of course in a diversified portfolio you could use Bitcoin as your 2-5 percent total assets super risky portion.

Wrong. Because you do not know if its a bubble. the market cant be timed. Remember your diversifying so lets say it does correct 50%. Your diversified portfolio will only take a 25% drop. You rebalance and watch it fly back up past wherecit was at the same time adding your monthly amount.  
On the other hand this market might run up another 30-50 percent before a correction which you would miss out on.  The people who think to much, read too many doomsday headlines and do nothing stay poor. Nobody can flat out "save" enough money to be comfortable. The money has to work for you. The stock market needs a 20 plus year horizon to be effective. Read about dollar cost averaging.

The bitcoin investing crowd has the psychology of any other past or future single speculative investment. There is no such thing as a sure thing when your strategy and emotion point you to a single investment. If the goal in life is to have your net worth grow through investing then it takes diversifying in all kinds of stocks (usually through mutual funds), bonds, real estate and for many your own business.  Why risk so much on something so speculative when their are so many ways to grow your money with much less risk? Once you have money to invest the name of the game is "asset protection."  Taking your hard earned money and getting emotional about any one investment has shown time and time and time again to be a bad strategy for accumulating wealth.

This is so stupid. 1. Buffets stock is extremely diversified across many companies so is a much much much much much much much lower risk than Bitcoin. 2. Tons of investments have outperformed Buffets stock but all with high risk

"Betting" big on bitcoin. The word betting says a lot.
