The percentage of income that is taken as income tax scales with the amount of money you made that year.

Thanks, man. :p

I told my wife that I could buy Japanese stuff with BTC, and she was thrilled. I bought her a couple of little felt kittens. :p

The rescan went through, unfortunately, the coins aren't there. Crazyb0ne pointed out that Coinbase is having some issues with pending transactions.

Coinbase shows as pending.
Another user suggested that I make my client do a rescan. If that doesn't work, I'll look into this lead.

No, no it isn't. The sell for way cheaper than that.

Do you think that money just comes out of nowhere?
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:17:01
Thanks, buddy.

Shoot, I didn't realize you weren't OP. &gt;.&lt;

I'm on a boat, mother fucker, don't you ever forget.

It was a website that allowed users to buy drugs via BTC. It's recently been taken down.  There's a wikipedia entry, if you're interested in learning more.

Thanks. My OP says I'd already checked it, though.

Either of those addresses would work. Your btc client will change the "current" address every now and then to help keep you anonymous. 
 I just sent .03 BTC to the second one. You should be getting it here in a second.  
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:02:34
I'm still new to this. How exactly would I do this?
@_date: 2013-02-16 17:32:18
Hey, would you mind posting your wallet address here? I may send you bitcent or two. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 19:30:43
If you don't mind, could you put this somewhere in the main text? It could possibly be a table of contents, or a way of dividing the paragraphs?
@_date: 2013-02-14 15:59:58
Yeah, it's been synchronized for a while now. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 00:34:17
Honestly, $150 isn't a terribly large amount of money.

Bitcoin jokes ahead? Bitcoin user unaffected!
