I'd talk to the "Food for BitCoin" charity and see if they'd rather have a regular giver or a lump sum donation so they can invest in there physical location (add capital, repaint, start a "New vehicle fund", whatever they need).
The rest: I would love to see money being put into BitCoin advertisement and teaching. I feel like we see a lot of money being invested in BitCoin products or services, which makes sense since those have returns on the investment, but little investment in ways to reach out to people and show them what BitCoin is. I'm not thinking about a physical BitCoin school or BitCoin street-evangelism, but things like buying advertisement space online and developing high quality "What is BitCoin" or "How to use BitCoins" -type videos.

...or be responsible and put some/all into savings since I'm in grad school and about to get married.

Yeah, it took me a while to figure that out, too. I hadn't done any of these riddles before, so I didn't know he played a part before. When the clue said "Strikes again!", I thought maybe there was a "Secret Messenger" in previous riddles. I went to each reddit page for each previous riddle and did a ctrl+F search of "Secret". Eventually I found the username. I got lost in his clue for a previous riddle for a while before I realized that "Golden Key" was what I was looking for.
Very fun!

To clarify, I enter the combined key into the Brainwallet "Private Key", but there's no "OK" to press like the FAQ says to do. I know if I enter something into the "Source Address", then I get a popup, but when I press "OK" it says "No data".

I'm confused. I got past chest 4, solved the rest of the chests, and even converted the greek into english. What now? I'm really not good at BitCoin stuff. I have all the parts of the key, and I read the FAQ, but I'm still lost. Can anyone help?
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:57:06
Same. Giving up for now. I'll come back later to see the answer.
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:06:16
It's all good. A bit disappointing, but it was fun. Funnily enough, I finally figured out how to work the Brainwallet, but in between my previous attempt and me figuring it out, the wallet had been emptied. Ah well, there's always next time!

Ah well, I had the right key but didn't understand Brainwallet enough to follow through. Congrats to whoever did answer!  
  
Solution:  
  
**Chest 1: PALINDROME**




  
  
**Chest 2: CURIOSITY**




  
  
**Chest 3: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**




  
  
**Chest 4: NIGERIA**
This one was tricky for a lot of people. The clue is "Coordinates are within me." The number of characters in each word are: 11 3 6 2. N11.3 E6.2 puts you in Nigeria.  
  


  
(We'll come back to this one.)  
  
  
**Chest 5: SN 1054**
Clue: "The Chinese saw me a thousand years ago." If you google "Chinese Astrology 1000", one of the top results leads you to Super Nova 1054 (SN 1054), which was recorded by Chinese astrologers.  
  




  
This clue leads to a bunch of latin/greek symbols overtop Mayan symbols. Using Word, they can be converted to:  
Z 5 7 w  
y e g o  
d r k q  
  
Instead of reading left to right, Mayans read in blocks of two, top to bottom like:  
1 2 7 8  
3 4 9 10  
5 6 11 12  
  
This leads to the imgur picture reading: Z5yedr7wgokq  
  
  
**Chest 6: CYPRUS**
Clue: "37.983704, -0.687525"  
  
If you put this into google maps and use satellite view, you see a scale model of Europe and the north of the Mediterranean Sea. This specific location is the island of Cyprus.  
  




  
If you look up "TheSecretMessenger" in Reddit, you'll find there's a user named the same. He posted in an earlier riddle, and recently he posted: "I wonder if this one also has a hidden layer that can be unlocked with a Golden Key"  
  
If you go back to Chest 4, and enter GOLDEN KEY, you get:




  
Put it all together and you get:


  
Good luck on the next riddle, everyone!

Yeah, I'm stuck there, too. I know it's about programming, but I don't know enough of the lingo to guess the answer.
