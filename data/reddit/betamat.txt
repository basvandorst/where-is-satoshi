Also, the Reddit subs for BCH appear to be manned by immature teenagers

1 &amp; 2 you can buy bitcoin from other people, or some escrow service like LocalBitcoins
3 if you set yourself up a full node, it will download the entire blockchain for you, and with a bunch more research, you can work out how to view it

You have too much time in your hands :-)

* firstly, do what you want, don't take financial advice from strangers
* secondly, it's risky. Safer would be to not sell, and then do buy on the dip. Sure you'll need some more money, but I suspect that'll be a lower risk strategy with a perfectly good return on it.

When you look at a bitcoin graph, or when you measure it in USD, you're looking at the market graph of BTC/USD - "how many dollars per bitcoin" (*I know, mathematically it should be bitcoins per USD, but try not to think about that!*).
Naturally the graph of BTC/GBP would be similar, as would BTC/EUR etc. Ethereum would be ETH/USD and so on.
Those aren't the only markets though. You can have BCH/BTC, ETH/BTC, any combination you want generally. Then there's futures and all sorts... Have a nose around at the endless possibilities at 
What you could do is keep an eye on BCH/BTC, bitcoin cash vs. bitcoin. Right now, As the two values move against each other, when you get more BCH for your BTC, Shapeshift some bitcoin across to bitcoin cash. Similarly when the values move back, Shapeshift them back again. Sure, there are movement fees and Shapeshift fees and all that, but that's a straightforward(!) way to get more value out of the market.
Or do it with ETH/BTC, or LTC/BTC.
As with all financial advice, don't take it from strangers, and only use value that you can truly afford to totally lose. Don't Shapeshift everything out of BTC into CurrentlyFashionableCoin and then expect to recover. Just do little bits, and expect to lose it. Any success is then a lovely bonus for playing the game.
Now, if only it was straightforward to predict what they were going to do...

Congratulations! Now leave it well alone!
I promise if you start watching the graphs you'll go mad, and you'll start thinking "What if..." or "If only...", tweak it around in Shapeshift and manage to turn that 1BTC into 0.9BTC, and then 0.7BTC...
As you already know, you can buy bits of a bitcoin not just a whole one. So schedule a regular purchase and work your way towards 2BTC

This sounds like a pretty straightforward spreadsheet. Both Excel and Google Sheets will work fine on your phone as well as in your desktop browser. And Sheets is free. Go on, have a go...

You're an idiot :-D

Pretty much the same as this, just chucking the occasional hundred or so at it all when I can. While it's split fairly equally between BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC and a few alts for fun (give Dogecoin some love!) I got 1 BTC's worth a few months back. Regularly investing smaller amounts, and being patient :-) I'm planning twenty years ahead, not three months.

Well, at least it was at an ATH. Fees or not, keep the cash for a bit, wait for a correction, then buy back in.

Is Blockfolio on iOS? On Android at least, that would do the job nicely.
