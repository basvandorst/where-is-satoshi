Douchebag was an insult long before the 90s...
It is a device used to clean a vagina; I think it is more likely the source for the insult, not their lack of endorsement by the medical community.

Do you have a source noting that English was "dictated" by the conference?  The fact that someone else asked a question in English, to the English-only speaker, doesn't mean the only agreed language was English.

Sorry, was meant for the poster above, that there was an agreement to conduct the meeting in English.  Which from his response there was not, it was just conjecture, partly based on incorrect assumptions, as you note. 
I agree with you.

So, no source for your original statement....

Yes, it was a pretty active market for a while, and bitcoinbuilder claim their claims were accepted by the trustee during the bankruptcy, so should also work for the civil rehabilitation.
I also head the founder took his trading fees in gox coin, so he might have done quite well on those as well.

26 bitcoin of capacity really isn't impressive...
