You can trade 1 BCH for 3 BTC on gdax right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:06
BCH has EDA and zero-conf transactions, while BTC has RBF and Segwit.

'We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures' - the whitepaper, section 2
Segwit removed the signatures from the blockchain. There was also no block limit in the original paper.

gdax turned on bch trading very briefly and under low volume trading it reached an irrational 9500 before they shut it down

I dispute your position, since Bitcoin Core has refused to evolve to address its fees, which are the highest by far of all cryotocurrencies. Ethereum processes far more transactions per second at a fraction of the cost. I agree that there is little value in tradition when it comes to technology, but claiming Core is closer to the original vision is a lie.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:12:34
Litecoin and Ethereum are decentralized and secure but have substantially lower fees. Ethereum processes more transactions per second than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is strangling itself and the only people who can afford the fees are those who are cashing out 10x on the hype. When the hype dies the coin will drop hard, and without EDA, blocks will be unprofitable to mine, and the chain will die, followed by the network.

6 GB memory and about 250 GB disk.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:20:10
You bring up some excellent points.
The network in 2013 had substantially lower fees and block difficulty. Implementing EDA in a chain that doesn't support it requires a hard fork, and many will not consider such a chain Bitcoin because EDA did not reach consensus. Without EDA, Bitcoin can die from a major sell-off, no hyperbole.
2X was canceled by its devs well-before the fork date even with ~90% miner consensus. They should be embarrassed by their code, but a part of me suspects it was intentional. Regardless, there will be no block size increase on the BTC chain because the core devs are opposed to on-chain scaling.
The DAO HF was voted on; some 80% were in favor and the remainder became ETC, but ETC is not more decentralized than ETH because it has way fewer nodes. Probably future hardforks will be implemented to remove child porn when the block gas limit gets large enough to hold it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:54:14
Only Bitcoin, actually. Every other cryptocurrency has decent fees and settlement times, but Bitcoin has been strangled by small-blockers. You can send Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, or Ethereum for a fraction of a penny, and some cryptocurrencies such as IOTA and RaiBlocks have no fees at all. Please don't be dissuaded from crypto by the state of the first mover.

While your transaction is pending you can replace-by-fee by submitting another transaction with the same nonce and a higher fee.

The last transaction before they closed BCH trading was at $9500 per BCH. Price discovery is protected by the other exchanges that have substantially larger volume. See CoinMarketCap.com for the exchanges and volumes.

Pending transactions do not get dropped. You can replace a pending transaction with another that has a higher fee but I do not know how to do that on nano ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:15:08
We tried. The core developers are puritans opposed to block size increases. Some at would argue that this belief is motivated by a desire to collect transaction fees from 2nd-layer services.
When 2X was cancelled I sold my BTC (for 7k each, rip).  The part of the community that wanted on-chain scaling forked Bitcoin Cash in August.
Disclaimer: I own no Bitcoin Cash.

With fees so high, you might as well keep it in the exchange: Beware that usdt may not be solvent, and exchanges that use it may not be solvent themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:28:00
Until your transaction is confirmed, you can replace-by-fee by sending another transaction with the same nonce and a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:15:17

You can only forge your own transactions, and 51% computing power only lets you rewrite history to include or exclude transactions. Modifying transactions is not possible because of public key cryptography.

They increased my limit when I signed into gdax.com for the first time. Coinbase's exchange is gdax.

Even if the app doesn't allow it, you can use gdax directly.

We'll see if fees lessen, but Bitcoin will not find mass adoption as electronic cash until they do. Bitcoin Cash is not a cash grab; it was a community split over scaling. Time will pick a winner, but so long as fiat loses I'll be happy.

Tipping is not practical here currently because the OneTrueCoin's fees are cripplingly high, and will remain so until Core finishes its off-chain solutions. UsurperCoin achieves lower fees and fewer pending transactions by embracing heretical ''Big Block'' strategies.

A burn address is an address to send money so nobody can get to it. The coin could be recovered by deriving a private key.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:03:41
See Section 2, Transactions:
'We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.'
Segwit removed the signatures from the blockchain. For better or for worse, BCH is closer to the whitepaper.

Reducing supply increases the price. If you want to kill 2X you have to sell it safely, being careful not to allow your BTC to be sold via replay attack. A lower price of 2X reduces miner incentve for that chain.

Most of them are based off of Bitcoin.

Maybe if we reduced the block size, Bitcoin would be more decentralized /s.

I hope you are aware of the bitcoin scaling problem and have done due diligence for this risk. Generally, investing all of your resources in one thing is a bad idea.

Anger is typically built on ignorance.
Nobody is firing Core, and I don't expect them to quit if the market prefers bigger blocks.
I don't know if you're a developer, but if you've ever used git you would understand how easy it is to pull upstream changes. Forks require less maintenance than rewrites.

Dan’s launched both of his prior projects, and they’ve been relativey successful. Steem boasts more transactions than all other blockchains combined, and supports them without fees. I expect Dan will deliver this project as well. The EOS testnet has been running for several months, and firms are lining up to be validators.

The block difficulty adjusts dynamically according to the available mining power by increasing the required number of 0-bits in the hash, targeting one block per 10 minutes, so the system should never become unusable. Bitcoin can work with very few miners, though more is better ofc.
Price drops will cause mining power to flee but they will not align with the halving of the block reward because of supply and demand.

If you can’t spend it how you like, it isn’t really your money.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:44:12
1. The fewer miners there are, the more profitable mining becomes.
2. Halving the block reward will increase the price because less bitcoin is being created every ~10 minutes.

Transaction fees are still very high, and the blocks are still full. Most of his concerns are still valid, even though the price has gone up 12x.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:03:23
Presumably 2XCoin would be open to further block size increases but otherwise track Core.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:23:58
2X doesn't require much dev support because it's a fork. The only difference between 1X and 2X is a one-line change. Pulling upstream changes is very easy.
