I don’t think anyone is advocating zero taxes. Unless they are an asshat driving on a freeway to work and saying “zero taxes for all”. 
That being said, I have a shit load of problems with what you just said. 
First of all, the “government” does not “make” money. Currently, and has not always been the case, they simply issue money. And even that is not as it seems. They don’t simply print more money (though they do this too) They lower the interest rates which effectively makes more of this “money” available. Money itself has no value (cough-antibitcoin are you??). Money (cough-bitcoin) has value because the “government” said it does and we accepted what they said to be true. No one under the age of 16 needs a gold standard explanation.  But let’s not forget that gold also has very little value beyond what we say it does. Jewelry (useless). Some dental work. Some value with computers (minimal). Gold is slightly better than paper money. Both have almost no actual usefulness...therefore almost no actual value. Same with bitcoin. Though if we are going to “say” something has value, I have my bets set on bitcoin which has no government manipulation. Because at the end of the day we need some kind of medium of exchange. Food and water provide the BEST value but are a terrible medium of exchange. 
Second, there is no separate entity called “government”. We, the people, are government. Though these days, almost no one understands this. You see, when WE, the people, created the constitution, we allowed a few elected officials to oversee things. Our primary concern was defense and a few basic human rights. WE felt WE were perfectly capable of running our own individual states. But felt we needed a UNITED front to protect all of US from invasion/war as well as a few human rights. So we gave a few ELECTED (by us) people the power to do so. 
As time went on, these elected few took advantage of their positions. And in order to ensure their power, they expanded. With expansion came greater power. With greater power came money. Money=power. Power=money. 
These few elected people eventually became so large, so powerful, so wealthy that we now have what we call government today. Which has only a limited role in defense and an enormous role in just about everything else. That is on a federal level. 
As for the states, which were supposed to control EVERYTHING with the exception of national defense, they have been hindered with major financial difficulties because the GRAND MAJORITY of the money that the people in that state make goes back to the federal government. Take a look at your tax bill. You should be questioning why the federal government (who’s only original job was national defense and basic human rights) received so much more money than the individual state who was supposed to provide everything else. And why is this so? It was manipulated this way so the states could be dependent on the federal government. Basic psychology shows that when you are dependent on someone or something, you lose control. Exactly what the few elected set out to do. 
So in current day, you ask, how can the “government” fund operations? The federal government does not need to fund anymore than it has. In fact, it should be severely diminished. Diminished to its original intent. The defense of the country and the upholding of basic human rights. Everything else should be left up to the states. And they should be given the grand majority of the tax money to do so. If you believe/don’t believe in welfare, you should be able to align yourself with a state to your liking. Pro/anti Abortion? Align yourself with a state to your likening. Guns? Align yourself with a state to your liking. Each state should have full authority to do as they please within the confines of the UNITED agreement of defense of the country and basic human rights. And if an issue becomes too large, overwhelming and divisive (ex: in the past, slaves. Currently, abortion) then we have the Supreme Court (appointed by elected officials) to determine if this is a UNITED issue or a STATE issue. (Their original intent).

How can you equally love it but not understand why people say it so much?
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:25:19
Ugh. When trying to talk to my dad about the economy (which we both have a healthy understanding of the bs), and I mention inflation he’s like “oh I don’t give a crap what the price of bread is today. It doesn’t matter” oh dear old dad. 
I feel the grand majority of people feel this way. Basically anyone with a savings account definitely feels this way. Well maybe half of them actually understand you need a savings rate ABOVE the inflation rate. The other half believes what the government says the inflation rate is and so they think they are doing good ��

I once accidentally mixed up the social security numbers on the tax returns for me and my boyfriend. I did his taxes with my social and my taxes with his social. Never heard a word. Just sayin...

As can be said of all people at all times. There are even arguments that pure altruism does not exist at all. Though I haven’t jumped on that bandwagon completely, it certainly sounds true. We pick up helpless animals off the street because WE feel bad for them. In order to make the bad feelings go away, we help the starving puppy.

Funny but true. The grand majority of the people we are talking about here have less than 20k in crypto. The IRS does not make your life a living hell for under 20k. Not to say they don’t care at all. But this idea that there are going to be auditors sent to your home, talking to your neighbors, investigators spending years of their life building a case against you...no. None of that is happening. You want to hide under 20k of crypto, less than 1% of those are getting caught. And when they do, they pay their little fine, hold onto their crypto and sell a few thousand dollars worth a month later to make up for the fine.
@_date: 2019-11-07 00:23:53
I figured low income gets audited because the ratio is a billion to 1. Ok I don’t have the exact stats but there are far more poor than exceedingly wealthy.
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:07:41
Plenty. But this is Reddit. And you are you. You can’t have meaningful discussion when someone is so arrogant to assume they know for an absolute 100% that every aspect of religion is bs. It’s a very simplistic view and really not worth the time.

I’m not arguing in defense of rh, because they may just be straight up lying. 
But without the convo moving into a lying/fraud scenario, they do say it is in your own individual wallet. It was deep in the fine details that I read. And that they eventually will provide access to your wallets. Will they? I dunno.
@_date: 2019-11-07 01:29:52
Don’t know what reason is so can’t tell if that’s some kind of insult. I just stated what I believed to be true. That because there are far more poor than exceedingly wealthy, there would clearly be more audits for the poor.
@_date: 2019-11-14 06:02:25
Same. 
And I’m positive the economy will collapse as it has no other choice at this point. But it will be a slow creep like you said. We won’t wake up to $10,000 bread. Hell its already on a slow creep. Since 2008. Even if the stock market collapsed in the next 3 months (and that’s a very real possibility), it will still be a creep to 3rd world ideals. 
Food, water, ammo, cash, bitcoin, silver &amp; gold. You need it all to protect yourself from every possible outcome. And even then it may not be enough.
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:11:04
Makes sense. 
What doesn’t make sense is your certain it doesn’t exist for those part of a religion. And though it can be true those are the reasons someone does something, it’s not unique to religion. So it’s all or nothing. Not 100% true for religion but questionable for everyone else. It’s either true or not true.
@_date: 2019-11-07 00:25:54
I think this is true. And depending on the amount of wealth, and depending on the stability of the country at the time, it may in fact be a good idea to leave the country.
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:25:14
This. 
People do this with the stock market too. There are so many different price points over any random amount of time that you can prove any point with it. If you bought amazon stock end of 1999 at $76 and held it for a year, it dropped to under $6. If you held it to now it’s over 1700. If you bought and sold Kmart stock until they filed bankruptcy, you could have made a lot of money. If you held it past bankruptcy, you lost it all.

I bought a little bit a few minutes before the crash, went to the bathroom and was shocked to see it tank in that amount of time. But whatever I just keep buying more when it goes down. 
Unless you can hold it for 30+ years, you shouldn’t be going “all in”. Buy over time. And definitely don’t put all your eggs in one basket. I believe in bitcoin and the technology behind it. However, if we go into a massive depression in the next year, it’s not bitcoin that will save you. It’s gold.

You SHOULD feel sorry for people who get influenced by random Reddit comments. They are going to need everyone’s sorrow just to make it to tomorrow.

I thought that too because you can’t transfer it out to your wallet. But according to Robinhood, the crypto is in a wallet in your name and they are working on the ability to transfer it to other wallets. Don’t know if that’s true or not but that’s what they say.
@_date: 2019-10-03 05:01:51
Take my .003 bitcoin and live the life?
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:35:55
And suddenly Robinhood is down. Interesting.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:51:08
1 bitcoin each? That’s expensive af.
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:33:59
When fiat crashes, gold/silver will be a better alternative. Even though I believe that bitcoin is the best of all currencies in the long run. But assuming a complete breakdown of the economy, the majority will turn to gold/silver as the majority does not believe or understand bitcoin. It’s just the facts. And bitcoin requires electricity and internet. So if we are talking about something from the Great Depression happening, bitcoin is not going to cut it. Bitcoin is for stable economies. Where people aren’t struggling to keep the lights on. Much less their internet. I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy it. You absolutely should buy it. But it will be a long time before it takes off in this environment.

Someone posted an old newspaper article from when email became a thing. It was quite interesting as you could see how everyone was struggling to understand just what the heck it was. And I still couldn’t tell you the technical steps of what happens when I send an email, but I sure can use it multiple times a day. 
Not saying people shouldn’t read up on what exactly bitcoin is. But even the most computer illiterate still manage to use email. You don’t need to know the technical aspects for something to be useful.

I don’t think you are wrong. 
But we give way to much responsibility to the banks and government. When they can loan out fictional money and charge interest for it, you know they have acted irresponsibly. One of among a thousand different issues of irresponsibility. 
What the fed, govt and banks have created is one of the biggest legal scams I have ever seen.
