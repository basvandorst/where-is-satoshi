I don’t know how to use LN, and I have been into crypto since 2014. The masses need an easy hardware app. Trezor and Ledger Nano are not very easy to use.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:15:54
I’ll check on that one, thanks! I can easily fix that in a future version... also if there could be any other text that would be appreciated!
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:45:17
Exactly! There are a ton of holes in this space and it’s not ready for prime time! I’m putting my thoughts out there to hopefully help people understand what a banker or no-coiner thinks about bitcoin. This in turn may give someone some ambition to make a product that helps this space instead of just hodling.

If someone makes bitcoin like Apple Pay, we are golden. Purchases go on a credit card, or debit card then you need to send BTC from a hardware wallet to an exchange, convert it, send the fiat to your bank, then pay your credit card bill... long process and takes a lot of work to even do once a month.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:51:55
I think I agree with every word on this. I think the $20k BTC was purposeful and to make the masses afraid to invest.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:11:23
Planet alignment and Bitcoin eclipse.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:04:29
You are correct, while bitcoin maximalists hate on Coinbase, they are the shiny crown jewel in the crypto space.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:05:57
Agree, I use my Apple Watch and Apple Pay for most transactions (easiest in my opinion) and I get cash back on my card for paying my bill on time. My next go to is cash.
@_date: 2019-04-11 00:09:02
On this one I tried to match the font from the original movie 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:35:31
BINGO! Love this comment! I use BTC as my saving account, LTC as my checking account and that’s about it. BTC is not a good resource for small payment, but great for large payments. That’s why I use Litecoin for small transactions.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:05:12
I love this! Maybe the pill could be “blue”.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:13:53
I was originally going to make the apex the “bankers” but I thought this would be a more positive theme on the history of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:31:35
Some banks don’t work with crypto, and verification plus the whole know your customer thing...
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:54:21
I created it thinking that the technology behind bitcoin is at a higher level than our primitive thoughts and beliefs.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:02:27
We have a snack store at work, nobody is in there and it’s based on the honor system. I use wireless Apple Pay with my Apple Watch it’s really convenient! If bitcoin could grasp that technology then I think we have something easier faster and better than cash or credit cards!
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:43:30
Ok so what do I get out of doing this?
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:07:13
Yes, my birthday is in July and every year it’s somewhat depressing. I have bought the dip, when BTC goes down, most everything goes down too.
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:08:53
Yes, agreed. A great feature would be a multi sig wallet that upon death, the crypto goes to the other parties. Another feature would be to have a similar multi dig wallet to pay bills and make house payments.
@_date: 2019-04-16 02:33:27
You forgot the part when you exchange fiat for bitcoin for a fee and then move it into a secure wallet with your own private key for a smaller fee, then find someone who accepts it then negotiate a BTC / USD price, which changes during the transaction, then you can scan a barcode and hit send. The transaction takes place for another smaller fee. Wait 10 min.  or so then confirmation. That was easy!
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:04:01
The hot wallet would be designed as the other party has a pin and you have a pin. That way you know the other parties ID, hence they would get paid when you release funds and it would be in real-time not month to month billing.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:02:05
Agreed, I work with and know some pretty intelligent people engineers, executives who have a lot of degrees and are scared of the stock market and terrified of investing in bitcoin. Most of them do not invest in stocks, bonds, property, gold, silver. They are ignorant of personal finance.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:56:12
Yes, you are correct. There will only be adoption when the 3rd parties join crypto and will unfortunately bastardize it to death... A retailer could skip the visa mc machine and use a tablet, smart phone, or computer to transact. Craigslist has the crypto option, but can’t compete with eBay or amazon. Known fact Amazon wants your paycheck!
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:48:07
I think the new phones with built in cryptography coming out soon will make me leave iOS and Apple.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:02:27
I think that the killer app &amp; hardware will be smart devices with built in cryptography with near field secure transmission.
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:57:16
How about for international travel, convert any currency or coin at any point of purchase. I think that would be worth something!
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:07:27
I believe the ultimate goal of Amazon is for them to get your entire paycheck. I think they filed for a banking license as well!
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:01:28
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:49:18
Correct! Thanks, I’ll take a look!
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:56:13
The dollar will go on and so will bitcoin, any changes to the dollar will be multi-generational. I keep hearing about this myth that the dollar will collapse, your masters will not allow that to happen for the next 25-50 years or so. Bitcoin will be an alternative.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:59:17
Yes that would be a useful and profitable fundamental for the space! The infrastructure is already there. It’s coming, just may take a decade or two. Lol
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:55:26
The masses do not understand what decentralized is, much less experienced censorship. They are completely OBLIVIOUS.
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:29:12
There is this theory that the USD will collapse, I do not see any evidence of this. As a matter of fact, the USD is pretty strong right now. I can see a gradual shift to digital currency that would probably take a decade or two to adopt.
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:58:40
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:52:44
I know, all of the top bitcoin maximalists seem to only talk about price and charts and who is Satoshi. Imagine if all that human energy and thinking was used to solve the mass adoption dilemma!
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:34:44
Ha, ha yes!! I looked up the music score and it is not original the song used in the ape sequence is called “Also Sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30 (Obertura)” - Richard Strauss, 1896  performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:29:53
Someone needs to alert the masses if this is better and easier than banks, cash and credit cards. Sorry I’m being a bit facetious.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:09:53
Thanks! Might have to do a re-do for font!
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:06:15
I totally agree, and to make it decentralized and not owned by any other entity.
@_date: 2019-04-15 14:45:10
For mass adoption it does need to be easier.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:13:19
Ok convince my co-workers, family &amp; friends. They don’t even know what bitcoin is and if they do know about it, it’s all bad. Sheeple....
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:57:36
The emerging markets may bring mass adoption because they may already have the technological infrastructure and go from barter system right into crypto skipping fiat altogether.
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:11:35
The masses don’t listen to financial experts, engineers and programmers but as soon as their favorite celebrity promotes it, its go time! Celebrities are the smartest people in the know universe, right?
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:35:41
Crazy old man, I feel sorry for him in a way.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:12:19
There are a lot of obstacles for bitcoin adoption: 
Volatility - most everyone does not like losing any hard earned money, short term thinkers. Price predictions for $1million is ignorant.
Price - the price is too high. Most people have no money and are it debt so to even to buy 1 bitcoin at $5k would be insane to them.
Transactions: took me a an hour or so to sell some crypto off of a a few ledger nano’s had to find a cable, plug into pc, update firmware, send out, come back later and make sure the transaction went through.
Publicity: mainstream news usually just broadcasts negative news and fiat dinosaurs hating on bitcoin, McAfee says stupid things and makes the whole space look like idiots.
Bitcoin forks - confusing newbies that Bash is bitcoin and idiots in this space like Roger. Fraudulent exchanges, and scammy alt coins.
Payments - adoption is slow and painful for retailers, has to be easier to transact, some retailers trod it and then stopped. 
Regulation - governments and regulations don’t understand bitcoin, and will not confirm or deny legalization. Being legal is important when dealing with funds. Most investors have a lot of assets in other areas and to get slammed for illegal acts could lose everything you have. No, you don’t put all your wealth in a single asset like bitcoin.
I’m just getting started... want me to continue?
Disclosure: I bought my first bitcoin in 2014, and have a lot of skin in the game. I have weathered all the ups and downs since. My primary objective for BTC is a store of value or “slush” fund. I have done pretty well so far.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:29:37
The idea is that digital money Bitcoin is less expensive energy wise than other forms of money such as bills and coins!
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:31:15
BTC costs less to mine than gold. FACT.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:30:38
Bitcoin and green weed initiative? Lol ��
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:00:38
Thanks! That is why we have  and  The  maximalists are screwing up the experience as well. Coke vs Pepsi who cares it’s all fun to do ride this crypto wave.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:46:56
I’ll bet it goes down to $5k by Father’s Day.
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:51:18
Drilling into the earth, ruining the planet, strip mining, refining gold produces toxins by eliminating other metals, transport of gold, taxes, checks, weights and measuring, bagging, packaging transportation sales and repacking and shipping and delivery overseas!!!!
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:53:13
No brainer bro, bitcoin cheaper than Au (gold). 
FACT.
