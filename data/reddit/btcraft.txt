If you've got a backup of the wallet, you can create a new wallet on blockchain.info and import the backup there. 
Otherwise you can get in touch with the blockchain.info support. If you have a secret phrase set up you can use that with the blockchain.info support people to verify ownership of the account, or you can give them the alias and any other info you can remember (perhaps the password mnemonic that blockchain.info asks you to write down and re-enter when setting up an account). Good luck.

My phone scans the plastic code instantly, but I just tried scanning the picture of the code and like you found it wouldn't scan. I think this might have to do with the alternating pattern on the board that is in the background, since the whole thing is based on contrast. The QR specifications actually dictate a white border around the code area (which wouldn't I couldn't fit onto the pinboard I was using). I wonder what would happen if I took a better photo, or edited out the stripey board from the background...nananaw did it better below.

Check out [bitinnovate]( There is also [omnicoins]( and [spendbitcoins]( For larger amounts, it makes sense to use an exchange like [mtgox]( or [bitstamp]( but you will pay your bank's international transactions fees on top of exchange fees. Otherwise, you can use a site like [localbitcoins]( to buy direct from individuals with cash. 
How much are you looking to buy?

I think there is some possibility of being able to cancel a pending online direct deposit. With cash deposits over the counter, the bank has  none of the details of the person who makes the deposit so there is no way to for the buyer to stop the transaction after receiving bitcoins. So it is more secure for the exchanges. But you're right, it does seem antiquated. I'm sure people would pay a small premium for that service if it was offered.

No problem. You might still wish to start the sign up process for an exchange anyway, since it will allow for cheaper rates and the option of setting limit orders (an automatic buy/sell at your chosen price if the rate matches your order). For this you might consider [bitstamp]( or [mt gox]( You can also withdraw cash via bitinnovate but their withdrawals system stopped during a previous crash, and has daily limits so don't rely on it too much.

[Fixed version]( that scans... the second photo in the link is the back of the physical QR code. Oops!

The options I've used in Australia are:
Bitinnovate had lower commission last time I compared. The bank doesn't need to know what bitcoins are, just walk in with the required details and reference numbers after placing an order on the site, pay cash over the counter, get a receipt and you should have the bitcoins in your account by the time you get home.

Nice one! Isn't that always the way... you think you've had an original idea and someone has done it better and before. Tweezers are so crucial. I think the first photo is where I stopped trying to do them by hand and went to find the tweezers.

Okay... just worked out that photo is of the back of the QR code! [Here]( is the flipped and rotated photo which scans properly for me. Let me know how you go with it?

So a friend came over and brought these beads with her. You place them on the pin board frame then cover with baking paper and iron them flat to form a bonded plastic shape. She was making patterns and things with the beads then I had the idea to try making a QR code. One of the boards turned out to be the perfect size for this so I made a new bitcoin address and grabbed the QR code generated by blockchain.info. I never really liked these QR codes for simple links and things on advertising, but they do make a lot of sense for long complex codes like bitcoin addresses. Was very pleased when it scanned perfectly on the first try. It is nice to tie the bitcoin address to something physical like this. The beads we used are called Pyssla from Ikea, but there are plenty of similar products out there.

Interesting! So the second photo in the original link worked for you? As I said in another reply, I took the photo of the back of the QR code accidentally. Did it spit out '15CQVejgQLDykc1RkdajMC4XRvyD4piyU3'? Pretty clever that your reader can compensate for the code being back to front and 90* rotated!
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:39:06
Thanks, good point. I did notice this before starting, but the pin board I was using for the beads had no more space to leave a white border. Ideally I would have done it, but in this case it doesn't seem to matter too much.

I think robdag2 meant in nananaw's address.

In this picture is just the deposit address for a brand new bitcoin address, so no problem if someone scans the picture. But yes, if you used this for a pair of public/private keys you wouldn't want to upload it like this!

Great, good to know. Can you use this work for withdrawals too?

Otherwise, you should be able to restore the original wallet from an email backup. I think blockchain wallets default to automatically sending email backups if you've given them your email address. Good luck! 
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:06:56
Do you have an email associated with the blockchain wallet? You can use their [forgotten identifier page](
