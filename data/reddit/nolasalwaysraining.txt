Well no but for example a 135000 dollar house I own has a property tax of 150 dollars in Louisiana....let that sink in.

Just remember it hit 20k before. So this is peanuts

Buying property with your crypto gains is the only way to solidify your earnings. Property value goes up every year, and rent increases as well. Another great way is books and copyrights, anything that gives you royalties.

Love how it's listed under other lol

I'm playing both sides of litecoin and btc. I have orders on both ends. Who ever goes up i make profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:41
Yeah a feature that is going to destabilize the market. Should have given at least a day of advance warning, like they did about the BTC segwit fork. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:40
I want people to have a fair shot to adjust their positions. Unlike this obvious insider trading pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:56
Long live bitcoin?

Please, social security is paid every time you pay income tax, we pay for social security, not the govt. If you worked you're just getting a small portion of your tax money back when you collect social security.

I'm there with you buddy, my first year actually investing like this so I guess I'm turning my log books in to my book keeper. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:21
I mean they could have given anyone of us current coinbase customers some fucking advance warning. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:55
Ride it up to the top then trade out for litecoin as it falls. Win win. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:00
I doubt it, she's dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:26:03
Can we make this happen
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:04
I don't know but I'm terrified to sell bitcoin now. I sold out for ltc and then bought back in after it jumped 400 while I congratulated myself on getting more litecoin than I could afford before. And then it jumped another 400, dunno where to get off I''m feeling the hodl!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:45:43
I slept on an order last night that lost me 3k, I thought I had cleared all orders before bed happy with my 575 Litecoin........sigh nope, it had a stupid btc exchange I missed. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:45
Not really my position. As a millennial business owner I have a lot to lose but I have multiple avenues of wealth. If this one tanks I hold and focus on my other revenue streams. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:18
That is bound to give some people heart attacks and suicides. I used to have 2.45 more btc than I have now. Lured in by alts. sigh
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:24
This is fucking nuts 14400 in the space of 30 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:08:57
When you say alts are you talking about ltc as well, which seems to imitate btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:32
Well if you sell at 19k you can really buy the dip lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:08:31
Paid way too much for that car lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:24
Tell people you're going to add it on a specific date and time. As they are doing now, canceling all trades until tomorrow at 9am pst and then only post
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:44
I didn't own any btc, all in on ltc so I got nothing I guess
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:57
I'm sorry I didn't realize I needed to peruse the help section of gdax and the API (Neither of which I look at unless there is a connectivity issue) in order to find out news about BCH addition. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:26:54
He probably bought back in no?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:37:35
Is Everyone on reddit only investing in bitcoin to buy cars?
Cause that's what it seems like. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:10
This is insider trading at it's finest. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:03
At the edge of 20k really
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:05
I never said to just tell the customers. They could have made any announcement with warning prior to dumping it on their website. I never suggested exclusivity for the customers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:48
Follows it down but not up clearly lol. 19k just broke the server
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:13
One can dream of unicorns and rainbow poop
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:56:53
Fixed this by switching to a different browser and also turning on my vpn for different ip
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:34
It's pretty simple logic, yes you can sell, but to do so now it suicide. If we had the foresight to do so when it was in the 17-18ks that would have been great but we didn't. All I'm doing now is accumulating more crypto by trading btc vs alts and waiting for the sure return of a pump. Those who dump feed the pump, it's just economics, it's bound to happen. For those of us who weren't keen enough to sell high we must hold or we lose it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:58:49
Ia that the cx-9 or cx-5

People act like our taxes going to social security is a horrible thing. It's probably one of the few good things they do with tax dollars, like roads and public schools. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:41
Hah I'm down over 60k, but it will recover, when people start purchasing futures in the other direction
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:38
I keep wondering is it's the best discount I'll get on btc today when I make my trades. I mean we are down some 5000 dollars a coin. Big profits. If the futures don't fuck everything up by betting on losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:54
BCH isn't even showing on the graphs though. You can't buy or sell it on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:21:04
Fine....I bought in at 7240 last time and took a dip to 5400, held it until now, just bought it back. lost .001 Bitcoin I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:10:43
Yeah in the long run it corrects. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:57:42
She has none, and yes to the second part. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:27
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:59:26
So 14049000 $ today? I hope she bought back in. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:08:06
Not much to it. I started a house flipping business and moved cities. Still one kid, but money dwindles when the wife says she doesn't want to have a job anymore because "you can afford it"
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:47
lol this is so me. I just lost 7000 dollars over the past two days. AHHHH
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:09:48
I keep it on an exchange to exchange it....hello. What do you transfer it back to Coinbase before making a transaction? I have open buys and sells limit orders.

Divorce means you lose half of your money. Community property law. Most of my money is in real estate.

I'm still petrified that it will be a bubble and collapse and I'll be losing a fortune. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:14:44
Is there no way to buy directly on Gdax with credit cards? Hate having to go through coinbase for this
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:53:38
Paying off your car isn't always a good deal. I mean you just spent what at least 25k on a car that will lose value every year, or you spend a little each year on a loan you can trade in for a newer better car in three years. I bought in full before and i regretted it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:22:08
Hey if I had waited for the dip and bought at 5400 I would have been a much richer man right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:11:27
Trying to excuse that to my wife when i already put 40k in lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:39:44
I feel your pain
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:10:30
Bought back in at 2.38 btc instead of 2.75 I'm still on the upswing. Probably going to put 100k in it tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:12:15
This is not exactly low right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:03
Don't you mean $11,000
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:28:52
I always check reddit the day after an abnormal dip, never disappoints. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:12:28
For those of us newbies that just bought into bitcoin, seeing this 1600$ drop in price is giving me a mini heart attack lol. It seems like I always learn information after it would have been useful. Expecting the hard fork and buying bitcoin and watching it crash spectacularly and lock up my money for a long buy and hold. It has come back from worse drops than this before correct?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:59:34
You could just not turn it into cash, pay for things with bitcoin. They can't tax you on the growth of the value of the asset unless you withdraw correct? Accountants?
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:08:15
No. LOL

That's how you lose half of it immediately. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:28:26
Put 20k in. Not 100k. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:13:25
With this hardfork coming on the 16th I am trading on Gdax but worried about the possibility of losing my coins. Would trading for ETH be a reasonable alternative to having a hardware wallet? Would ETH coins be at risk as well? I say this because obviously you just can't be trading if your coins are locked up in a hardware wallet, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:18:00
The truth is that no one cares if it's a bubble. They care if it going to make them money. And the more people who believe in bitcoin the better it works. Bitcoin is like prayers except bitcoin actually works by going up 900% in a year. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:11:28
Did the same. I've been holding since this. No point trying to predict the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:44:59
I typically trade all of my coins on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:25:22
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:15:54
Freakin stressful. Imagine having to explain that to the wife. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:19:28
What other ways? Enlighten me?
Gdax doesn't actually tell you the USD value of your coins without doing that. Coinbase will tell you but Gdax won't. Unless I'm mistaken somehow.

Btc could fall just below 6000. That is the charts speaking. Over the last 6 months that is where the heavy suppprt lies.
