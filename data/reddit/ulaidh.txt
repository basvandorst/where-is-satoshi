What's the link between big use case and higher price?

I read the intent of the post wrong. To me "most big uses don't come until price is higher" seems to imply that a higher price is a prerequisite to a big use. My point would have been that a killer use case could be developed at BTC$10 or BTC $10000. 
Again though, I think I misread intent.

Unless I can actually do something with the gems (like convert to BTC) then from an individual user perspective I don't see the value-add. Sure, if an advertiser wants to pay me "gems" in order to get my eyes on their ad, that sounds intriguing, but if I can't do anything with these "gems", then I think the obvious question outside of it being a neat concept, is why am I using it?

How do you convert gems to Bitcoin?

So why not just use BTC?

Despite the fact that I "have no idea what I'm talking about", please allow me to explain to you what you're missing and what the documentary fails to explain. First off, let me repeat there is no hidden code snippet that identifies HFT to an exchange and allows them to give them preferential treatment. Secondly, it's important to remember that Mr. Bodek can, under a reasonable interpretation, be considered an HFT. The problem here is that Mr.Bodek's competitors knew about how a particular order type worked, and he did not. I have complete respect for his position as exchanges need to be 100% transparent about how their order types work, to ALL their customers (and Direct Edge was fined for this lack of transparency perhaps in large part due to Mr. Bodek's issue). However, there is no hidden code snippet, it is in the specs of the order type, granted not abundantly clear. What's even more important, is that as an investor, these particular orders have no bearing on your experience in managing your investments. You have no use for these order types which are designed to allow electronic market makers to manage specific SEC rules. This is one proprietary trader battling it out (with a legitimate argument) battling it out with other proprietary traders. It's about full and clear disclosure of all order types which are available to all participants. The point about only 10 coders getting this stuff is with all due respect, laughable. The specs regarding order types are not terribly challenging to understand from a coding perspective. Lots of people get it, but full transparency has been an issue. 
Hope this helps. There is no conspiracy against the little guy here.

With all due respect there is no code snippet that gives preferential status to HFT "insider" orders. HFT use order types that are available to everyone. Latency based front running exists in concept, but to be clear, there are tons of execution venues in the US. When an HFT market maker gets hit on one marketplace, from a risk management perspective they attempt to adjust their orders on other marketplaces to manage their inventory. They truthfully have no idea whether an execution is part of a cross market sweep, and If so, where the balance of that sweep is heading. 
There is nothing that is "completely guaranteed" and the exchanges have no code snippets that distinguish HFT orders from any other participant using a particular order type.  Don't get me wrong, the system isn't perfect, but the latency frontrunning being discussed is a product of moving to an electronic competitive marketplace. If you're a retail investor looking to buy 500 shares of your favorite stock, you've never had it better than in today's market.

Simple question: where in the FIX specs for the order types in question (I assume you know which ones) does it provide for any distinguishing between classes of participants?
