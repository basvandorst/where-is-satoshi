Doesn't mean you'll get it back.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:15:07
I will answer that: no.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:52:00
Wait. What? No Way!
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:46:38
that's my point. it's still a common occurrence and is often beneficial to the victims despite not being a legal contract.

Monero is not trying to be for small transactions. It is aiming to be a currency for settlements. Like digital gold.

You need to ask your doctor for stronger meds. I'll have a word with him.

I'm assuming there are enough people using non-borked cryptosoftware to bootstrap the process already.

Are you, I_DID_LSD_ON_A_PLANE related to bitcointalk user, allyouracid?

For everyday goods, you'll pay more if you use bitcoin than if you use cash.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:58:17
About 1/7th of a Gox.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:33:00
No surprise, dude is loaded.
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:56:28
Why can't we use blockchains to establish a consensus on the legitimacy of websites?
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:59:15
Where did you get the figure of $500M from.
I've heard 120,000 bitcoins were stolen which is more like $70M.

How can 3x your money go out from your wallet? Surely once it hits zero (i.e. 1x) that's it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:49:05
maybe it's part of the shitty aesthetics.

That's what Bitfinex is trying to claim, but it's not obviously true. And the way they are sharing the losses suggests they themselves are not convinced of this.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:53:23
Bitstamp was about 19,000 BTC.  
Mt Gox was about 850,000 BTC.
So in orders of magnitude this seems to be about midway between the two.

You realise you're replying to the wrong comment?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:27:48
what about all outputs in 3,2 and 1 figures?
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:36:04
You sound like an ideological slave to me. Do you pay your taxes in bitcoin too?
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:29:13
Ah I didn't realise Satoshi conceived bitcoin because he had just lost $70 million.
@_date: 2016-08-17 09:34:38
Karpeles hasn't yet been convicted of crime. He was in jail pending trial, but has since been released on bail.

bitcoin.org has an ssl certificate but from what we can see, we do not know who owns it and if they can be trusted.

It can hardly be considered a credible warning when it comes from an anonymous reddit account with a sum of 2 posts and nothing to back it up.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:12:28
Reality is not composed of documents.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:44:32
What if your account is one that has been stripped bare?
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:43:57
Because bitcoin hates daddy and has not been on speaking terms for a long time?
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:12:44
It may be the fairest way, but if it were to result in bankruptcy for Bitfinex, and they think they can legally wiggle out of it they may do otherwise.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:35:03
not much different to paying off a kidnapper.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:09:24
I wasn't talking about bitcoin or bitcoin.org – I was talking about a way to establish the legitimacy of websites using a blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:24:51
It's almost like someone was encouraging funds to be moved to Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-09-01 17:48:00
So who is buying 0% bonds?
@_date: 2016-09-08 10:49:36
What is your strategy to live homeless without much of a problem?
@_date: 2016-09-01 15:58:48
Who would buy bonds offering 0%?
@_date: 2016-09-01 17:21:41
Are you claiming Bitfinex is as trustworthy as the German government backed by the entire German economy?
@_date: 2016-09-20 12:31:25
I don't.

@_date: 2016-07-22 17:04:46
Not if you use the bitcoin address on an exchange website that also retains your IP address.
