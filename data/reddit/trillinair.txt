It's like reddit silver!

Yes, go read the paper.  
 
Edit: I was a bit short in my reply here. From their website:  
  
"Sign up and create your event for a fraction of the fees charged on other online ticketing hubs. Create and issue your tickets, which can be anything from drink vouchers to early bird entry."   
  
Set Your Own Ticket Market Standards  
Choose if you want your tickets to be resold and in what price range, and even set a fee that you earn from every resale! No one can scam the system, so no more counterfeits and unfair, unregulated ticket black markets ruining your brand name.  
  
Promote your event  
Leverage blockchain-based micro-payments to create complex reward schemes for ticket buyers in exchange for generating you more ticket sales, drastically decreasing your promotional spend.  
Sell and Verify Tickets with minimal Fees  
Sell tickets for a fraction of the cost on the blockchain. At the event, allow your staff to easily and securely verify tickets at the door and the bar with just our app and a smartphone.    
  
There are some big claims in here. If they can they do it remains to be seen. I personally like where they are headed and what I have seen from them so far. Their public Beta is coming in this coming Quarter. If it's anything like their website I think an investment in them will yield fine results.

Buy some god damn eth right now if you want to buy. BTC is in HODL time.

Lol wat?
You must really have a bias against liberals to say such  thing. The fed don't give a shit about the legacy of any president. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:22:29
They are betting on BC going up in value. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:34:14
Which one and why? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:46:49
Have you seen Aventus to be overhyped? Looks like they are asking for 15million in ETH, they are planning to change a 6billion dollar industry competeing with ticketmaster(pile of shit) and stubhub owned by ebay(pile of shit). I like the idea, may put a few hundred on this one.  
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:03:11
Yeah, or BTC could continue to 5k before a pull back.
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:38:43
When i checked your profile earlier I saw u posted on in a thread that said "post here if u have been banned by /r/ bitcoin". You claimed u had been. Look I am not looking to attack u personally its just something I noticed when searching for the other material.  On your views regarding bcc and btc yeah I think segwit btc does not deserve the name but here we are.
I want to see both flourish as well but know I dont have some agenda going around attacking random ppl on thr internet lol. I have money to make and I dont keep my emotions tied to that money unlike alot of people you will find attacking your posts. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:16:40
Lol I made a video about this pile of crap earlier today: check it out.  
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:01:11
I found you claiming to have been banned from You post alot big dog, why don't you link us?

This is way under appreciated. Save and repost in 1 month when China is back in the news.

Soon enough you will be able to atomic swap the USD(T) for btc if you so chose but then you are putting your faith in Tether.. so there is that. I do understand this still doesn't solve the issue for physical fiat to crypto but it does allow for more options and liquidity for crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:48:36
I am aware most people hodl,  but this guy specifically claimed to  pack up and leave with just btc. Recently I have been looking into options to spend my  crypto(btc/eth/etc.) So hearing from people who are already doing it is what I am after.  
  
To add... I am transitioning to earning the majority of my income via crypto online which makes me need a way to spend it without meeting up with people to exchange for fiat all the time or relying on any exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:54:53
Guys, thanks so much for dropping in. I really love making these videos to discuss things I think are important in the crypto world and it's even better when it shed's light on some of the major event's going on around the world at the same time... Especially when we hear little to nothing from it in mainstream media.   
 
 
If you made it this far do me a favor and upvote for visibility, I post videos at least once a week and manage to get no traction every single time. My content creation skills are improving all the time so if you like this subscribe and stay tuned because I will be brining you MORE in the couple days!
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:13:20
This makes a hell of alot of sense but do you have any sources that proves this or is it just your thoughts on what they are likely doing? This is a real story if true.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:21:11
India you so crazy.
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:30:35
Great thing about bitcoin is nobody has to know you have any if you keep your damn mouth shut and follow OPSEC.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:25:59
Learn about Dollar cost averaging if you haven't already.

That's immediate 700% arbitrage gains less fees. GO GO GO.
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:25:57
I'm curious, care to share your story? Do you use bitcoin in everyday life?
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:20:36
Absolutely right, only issue is the guy is listened to by millions and millions of people with money and no sense. Check out my thoughts on the subject here
but the tldr version is hes a pos whose only opening his mouth to earn more money and protect the world he's from, fin.
There is a reason he is saying these things while btc is in a bear market, they have more effect right now than when btc is trending up.    
Hodl friends all is well.

S2x was the compromise, now they(core) want to back out.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:43:35
Actually segwit2x was the compromise in the NYA
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:45:54
They sure did in the NYA.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:12:04
Who's hiding? Let me get this straight by your logic if I post on btc I love Roger. Are you 5 years old? I post all over all crypto subs because I want a balanced view and discord among other crypto enthusiasts. I subscribe to no one coin. You too are free to do as you wish. Enjoy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:10:24
Always good when big youtubers get onboard!
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:08:05
Oh I see I made a valid point so I must be supporting Roger, nice.
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:57:13
Does this only work in situations with lots of volume and a large gap behind the wall? I can't do this with BTC right now but maybe with a lower market cap coin. Could you maybe elaborate or point me in the right direction to better understanding this? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:25:59
BCC supporter and BTC supporter here. Dude is a god damn liar.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:17:44
I even made a video about itt down vote me to hell but I think the guy is doing us longterm hodlrs a favor because we get the opportunity to buy lower! 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:10:02
For clarity, what do you mean by classic fork?
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:00:03
That should work. Anyone who wants to sell it immediately that is 100% the best way aswell. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:22:34
"Known as the New York Agreement (NYA) it was said to be a compromise between the two sides of the debate — those who want to achieve scaling through Segregated Witness (Segwit) and those who prefer to scale by increasing the block size. It consists of two sequential phases — to activate Segwit using BIP 91 (making it compatible with the UASF) and then to hard fork the base block size to 2 MB ninety days later. "  
  
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:36:52
Quit spreading misinformation. Segwit block weight is 4x IF EVERYONE uses lightning. It's not even close to that (6-7% usage)and won't be for sometime. Also the hardfork isn't hostile it was agreed upon by everyone in the NYA before BCH forked away. Now it is being presented as hostile by thousands of shills with old ass(fake) accounts and blockstream supporters. Go figure, once they got what they wanted(segwit) they(1x) are backing out of the agreement. You can't trust blockstream and co to do what they say they will at this point and from my pov it sure looks like segwit+lightning is the hostile takeover.
