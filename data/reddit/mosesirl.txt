Biometrics are insanely easy to hack compared to cracking an unknown SHA-256.

I've got people I can talk to, but thank you for the offer.

The former bit is actually really good advice. Maybe someone with more knowledge can chime in if there were any vulns at that time?
The wallet is Bitcoin (later bitcoin-qt) v0.3.22. The only transactions occurred during June 2011, if that's relevant.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:45:17
Trust me, it really feels like $600K.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:47:30
I'm still not super familiar with bitcoin and all the do's and dont's. Why not coinbase?
Only reason I used them was they were one of the first places I had heard of that you could use your bank/credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:08:47
Honestly, I feel like that would kinda suck even more than my situation. At least I can say I technically "held". 
People that spent thousands of coins back when it was first accepted in the "real world" probably thought it was pretty cool, only to have it be the biggest regret of their life.

If I had a sense of humor right now, I'd give a witty reply.

Lastpass vaults are encrypted with your private key and decrypted in-browser. Lastpass staff can't actually access anything inside it. I'll email them, but they've given me the same answer before on a separate issue.

Good suggestion, but my PC from 2011 is long gone. I work in IT so a lot of my gear comes and goes.

I'm a stoner, and my memory is absolutely fucked. Dunno if it's years of smoking or just my brain but I'm actually considering quitting for a couple weeks to see if my memory improves.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:00:51
I can load the wallet and see the balance (you can see any address's balance in fact), but the way bitcoin-qt works is a passphrase is necessary to unlock the wallet when actually sending a transaction. You can back up the private key in case you forget the passphrase, but I never did.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:06:09
Yeah, sorry, bad terminology. It's just a flash drive with an old copy of the Bitcoin Windows binary on it. I'll post a screenshot when I get home.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:52:58
I'll give anything a try at this point. Thanks
I'm about 75% sure that the passphrase was randomly generated. Back when Lastpass first became popular, I remember buying it and changing all my passwords to random strings (ie. "0q%8G$QWp17").

I don't really have much to gain from making it up, but if it makes you feel better, there were other reasons why I wasn't focused on bitcoin during those years, namely my fiance being in hospital.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:57:45
I know. God, I want to strangle my 19-year-old self for not creating a failsafe. But at the time I didn't know it would one day return 6000%.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:55:10
Only within 30 days (there's a "deleted items" folder).

Lastpass is an encrypted container, they don't have access to what's inside. It's decrypted in browser similar to the way encrypted email services work. Once you perma-delete something from it, it's gone.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:57:20
Are software wallets a bad idea then? I primarily use Electrum for my "offline" wallets, and usually move coins from Coinbase right to them. Hardware wallets are obviously better, but I would rather not have to pay for one unless I really needed it.
Only reason I mentioned coinbase in my OP was because I intended to put $600,000 in my bank account. Was high on excitement at the time.
And thanks for the advice, I'm still learning all this.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:28:11
If I knew that I'd have a bruteforce already done by now.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:04:44
Yeah, it's just that "what could have been" moment, I guess.
I got a lot of bills. With those out of the way, could have gotten a house, etc. But I get it, life goes on. I'm not any poorer, just feels that way.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:50:35
It would make a good story, can't argue with that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:34:34
When I bought it, it was somewhere between $90-100. If I remember correctly, it was part of my tax return that year, and I had gotten a decent amount because I was a student.
Nowadays I own more in crypto, and I obviously wouldn't make the mistake twice. Everything is encrypted and backed up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:14:54
Already backed up twice.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:35:49
There's no way for me to know what parameters I used. I changed them all the time, depending on character limits for given sites, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:51:39
You basically surrender the wallet to them, along with a list of potential passwords/phrases/numbers that might be the password or close to it. Then they attempt brute-forcing. My problem is my password was likely psuedo-random. There are no words or phrases to build a table from, so I'm pretty fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:50:46
I'm crying for me too.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:54:11
Holy shit. That first link you sent might just be worth trying.
I actually have a linux box with a decent GPU already in it. I'm gonna fire that up for a month or 10 and see what happens. Literally firing it up right now.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:46:04
I bought it with the intention of learning how it worked. Can't remember exactly, but Mt Gox seems like the likely place I bought them.
There were other things going on in my life during those years, so I simply forgot about it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:48:02
The bitcoin wallet software itself (simply called Bitcoin, nowadays called [Bitcoin Core]( I think) requests a passphrase when attempting to send. Most bitcoin wallets do this, if you set it up as such. Nowadays I use electrum which does the same.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:49:36
Just for posterity, I tried it. Nope.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:18:38
Didn't know I could buy something on Amazon with just an email, will have to try that out sometime.
