I mean it. Is it stupid in some way?

Great, that's what I wanted to know.
So, seed is basically just a convenience thing, built on top of the entire "keypair" technology. Like several private keys and addresses generated and combined in advance.
If I understood you correctly there are wallets that don't use seed and I might be interested to use one, just to get the idea. If you would be nice enough to recommend me one I would be happy to try it out.

Oh, so there IS some additional magic going on then.
So, you're saying seed is NOT private key, but rather something that can be repeatedly used to generate all keys that were ever generated with this seed? And it is the only info you need?
How is this supposed to work?
This seems to me a lot like "private keys for each bitcoin address are actually stored online, but you only get to access them with seed, which is actually just another private key"
But that seems stupid.
It also seems to shake my understanding of multisig then.
The other way to explain this would be that rather than generating random keys to access your bitcoin addresses, your wallet uses your seed as input data to generate keys in a predictable manner. Then both address and private key are generated in predictable way.
I feel suspicious about this, why aren't we just made to manually move around our private keys for each address?

Thank you!


So what defines the binary size?


So you're saying computing power required for maintaining blockchain is independent on amount of transactions? And the rewards aswell?


I'm not saying Bitcoin is worse than traditional banking system. I'm just trying to understand the system and potentially find room for improvement, I guess?
