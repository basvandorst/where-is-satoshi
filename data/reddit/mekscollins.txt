No doubt after he leaves office he will come out with DonaldTrump Coin and sue Trump Coin like Kanye did with Coinye ��

Agreed, especially considering it’s relative stable nature during Trump fud, Libra congressional hearings and other negative news that previously would have some sort of impact on the market. This has to be considered bullish

I wouldn’t say they don’t care about bitcoin, more that they are unable to stop bitcoin. There is no one they can pull in front of congress and question or any way from them to stop it even if they wanted to

Complete fraud but 62.3m follow him on twitter so can only be seen as a positive for bitcoin

That really is the crazy thing about it, still so much more upside and reach for people around the world. 
US Congressman Patrick Mchenry said last week "the world that Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned and others are building is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this innovation.” 
People are really starting to get it slowly��

Love this list! I have so much to catch up on. After reading traditional bitcoin/crypto books like “Cryptoassets” I really enjoyed the bitcoin standard so will go through this list, think I will start with digital gold. Cheers buddy!

Yeah this book opened my eyes up completely... never studied economics or had a general interest in understanding money and the power governments have with fiat controlled currency... Saifedean really helped me to understand the importance of these things and the role bitcoin plays within it all. The fact the first 8 chapters don’t even mention bitcoin �� I loved!

This has had great reviews, hadn’t heard of it before, thanks for the recommendation!
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:57:39
Very interesting, when was it written? I’ll take a deeper look into it, sounds cool

I was thinking bitcoin billionaires but didn’t think it explained bitcoin etc I heard it follows on from the social network book, though will def look into getting it now

30% interest for a period of 3 months sounds great, but ever since I was a little boy I’ve dreamed of becoming a member of the Royal Warrants Holders Association, absolutely priceless ��
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:16:21
I see the fund raising is going well ��

Excuse my mistake - Royal Warrant Holders Assiciation ��������

You’d think this would be common sense... I mean you’ve got this far how difficult you think it would be to spell check and get someone to proof read ��
