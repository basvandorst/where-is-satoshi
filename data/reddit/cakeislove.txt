Mycelium is open source? If not, how can the accuracy and security of this "Transaction Confidence" protocol be independently verified?
Also, the description of that protocol sounds like its reliant on "Mycelium servers". Is that referring to the wallet software itself or some sort of exchange server run by Mycelium?
I will admit that I've adopted an attitude of skepticism towards new bitcoin offers. It feels like for every legit new enterprise launched in or about BTC, there's 20 scams run by Randian supermen who just want to screw people over who don't really understand anything about the technology they're using.
Comparing the development of one software protocol with the development of the entire internet is a bit silly, don't you think? The turnaround for Bitcoin improvements should obviously be faster. The existence of double-spending exploits in BTC have been common knowledge since at least 2011. Where's the fix?

Why do you think banks charge fees? Meanness? To keep John Galt and his merry men down?

"(not many people know how to manually create transactions, relatively)"
Security through obscurity is always the way to go! People are dumb. They'll never figure it out!
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:25:25
There's no way that any miners would prioritize fees. Miners aren't in it for the profit, they are only doing their best to help Bitcoin.

Their stock might tank?
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:32:14
Go home, you're drunk.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:59:22
Last word.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:25:14
If that happens, BTC goes back down to the price it was when it was only good for buying drugs on Silk Road.

They'd go out of business pretty fast if they didn't, with these crashes, every couple months.

Yeah, and then abscond with all the Bitcoins, a few months later.
Every solution proposed seems to be reconstructing some aspect of the already-existing financial system, minus any and all regulation and public oversight.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:00:11
When you start at zero, the long-term trend is always going to be upwards. By the notions of some Bitcoiners here, Enron share prices didn't collapse in 2001, they merely broke even.

Your mom is pointless.

Cool. Thanks!

@_date: 2014-03-05 22:45:59
I suppose you're right. I didn't really consider counterfeiting in that way.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:03:49
"Let the buyer beware" isn't a solution. Your only "point" is that what myself and others consider problems aren't really problems, at all. Obviously, I and many others disagree with that assessment. Is your long term strategy going to be to continue ignoring us and hoping we go away?
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:48:07
I hope supermarkets start accepting Bitcoin with zero confirmations. I'll never have to pay for groceries again!

@_date: 2014-03-05 21:55:56
The problem has been known since 2011. If they were going to "fix" it, they'd have done it, by now. Obviously, someone at the so-called "Bitcoin Foundation" is profiting greatly from this "insignificant flaw".
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:01:00
Yeah, the IRS are just a bunch of nerdy accountants. It's not like they took down Al Capone or anything!
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:43:52
Dogecoin does tipping better. Just sayin'.
Oh, and transactions don't take an hour to verify, either.

@_date: 2014-03-05 21:45:55
Linked to another exchange that will eventually go down in flames in scandal.
The transaction speed problem has to be solved at the protocol level. More centralization will just result in more Goxing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:48:42
You're clueless. Double-spending can be and has been executed with modest amounts of investment for spectacular results. Burying your head in the sand won't make these structural problems with Bitcoin go away. Bitcoin WILL fail if changes aren't made to the protocol to speed up transactions and eliminate double-spend exploits.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:55:42
I bet you're great at parties.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:05:03
I'm not going to write a FAQ here, as I'm currently invested in BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:57:01
Now, let's see.. Use an exploit to scam millions or publish a proof of concept on Reddit for a few upvotes and some Dogecoin tips..
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:15:32
You would have a lot of money if you had bought DOGE at that price yesterday and sold today. Sucks to be you.

Just like black is a good bet after red comes up 8 times in a row!!
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:03:09
Actually, "everyone" thought Capone was untouchable and/or a sort of Robin Hood type character.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:37:33
I see you got a ton of upvotes from the BTC faithful for posting complete untruths.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:42:31
That's why you guys will always be on the political fringes. Your ideas always wind up sending you on the short bus to Crazytown.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:16:57
I was thinking more along the lines of tipping a blog post or a non-reddit forum post, but I hear ya! :)

It could be worse. They could have a picture of Ayn Rand as their symbol.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:31:20
You're still blaming the victim. Why hasn't the exploit been fixed? More to the point, who in the "Bitcoin Foundation" is benefiting from not fixing the exploit.
Yelling BULLSHIT BULLSHIT like a frat boy isn't winning you bropoints, by the way.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:06:14
So, recreate the entire financial infrastructure (including the fees) that we already have for regular money, only without any regulation or public oversight?
Why bother?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:16:16
There are worms in the digibits! I've seen it with my source-scanners!!
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:50:09
For the libertarian "end the fed" faction that dominates the Bitcoin community, lack of consumer protections are a feature, not a bug. They'll gleefully remind you with their "Let the buyer beware!" jeering, every time someone gets ripped off in Bitcoin.

Big Vinny charges 10% interest a day and the loan is secured by your kneecaps.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:40:27
If these tin-hat Bitcoiners really believed that BS about "fiat currency" collapsing any day now, they'd be hoarding gold or bullets and not libertarian internet money.
It's half self-assurance that they made a good investment and half attempting to trick others into believing that anyone actually thinks that the USD is going to collapse on Thursday.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:26:55
The reality of libertarian internet money is that people like the ones who robbed flexcoin will be the financial elite and regular joes will be their lambs to be harvested.
Bitcoin needs to be improved on a technical level to speed up transactions, eliminate double-spending attacks and institute some sort of chargeback/verification mechanism.
For reasons strictly due to political ideology, this will never happen, of course.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:29:14
Cash, by its nature, also can't be double-spent and transaction verification is instant. I think BTC in its current state compares far more favorably to Visa then to cash.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:24:41
LOL, count on a libertoonian Bitcoiner to attempt a retroactive defense of Al Capone against the big bad IRS!
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:13:17
Never go full retard.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:11:15
Slow transaction verification and easy double-spending are technical problems that must be solved or Bitcoin will burn out and only be remembered as an internet fad/scam. Downplaying those real and serious issues doesn't do anyone any good.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:19:59
Dogecoins? Oh, you mean the coin actually being used as currency instead of a pump-and-dump scam?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:13:19
Internet money doesn't need any help being any more trivial than it already is. Get with the program. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:22:19
What's up with this talking point? Bitcoin is not competing with credit cards in the 1960's, it's competing with credit cards in 2014 which are instant, secure and insured.
Oh, and the per-unit value digitally stored on them doesn't swing by double-digits, on a daily basis.
There are technical solutions to these problems, but they are being hindered by libertarian politics.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:17:05
Fuck that bullshit financial media and all those dumb fuckers on Wall Street!
I'm holding my Enron stock and I'll buy even more, as soon as I can find someone willing to sell to me! See that? Nobody else wants to let go of this hot commodity, either!

Should be the new slogan for Bitcoin, tbh.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:15:51
Nope, because mining difficulty (and thus block generation time) automatically adjusts to keep up with improvements in mining technology. 
Only thing getting bigger is the blockchain, which is a whole other technical issue that Bitcoin has to overcome.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:32:57
Downvoted by the non-existent libertarian Bitcoin army.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:50:38
Mt. Gox is gone. You said that Bitcoin would "fix" the problems. They didn't fix them before, and they still haven't fixed them. Half of the "Foundation" thinks that they aren't problems at all, and the other half just wants the cheerleaders to cheer harder and drown out all the naysayers.

Fair enough. I like your attitude and I apologize if my post sounded angry or aggressive.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:53:25
Or a wallet configured to send one transaction directly to the IP of the suckers' wallet and thousands of other transactions to all the major Chinese/Russian mining pools, with a nice fee to eliminate any risk that they'll accidentally mine the fake transaction.
By the time it's on the blockchain, you'll have your free bigscreen installed in your livingroom.
