I run 2 full nodes using VPS. One is hosted by bitvps.com and is somewhere in New York and the other is hosted by serverbros.co.uk and is in Canada.
Whenever I see a good deal on a vps I buy a year plan and install bitcoind and let it do it's thing. The serverbros VPS was $20 for a year with 1GB ram and unmetered bandwidth. The promo seems to still be good and bitcoind seems to be happy on an OpenVZ VPS.

tldr: deflation is a good thing.
Bitcoin the money is deflationary. Deflationary money breeds responsible consumers and drives innovation. A consumer is less likely to spend their hard earned money on cheap crap when their money will appreciate in purchasing power in the future.
Merchants and service providers will have to offer innovative products to get people to turn loose of their ever appreciating money. This will in turn breed efficiency in manufacturing and retail.
Deflation encourages people to save...or "hoard" and this drives innovation. Innovators can meet their daily living expenses from spending their deflationary savings and work on their pet projects.  Do you think Tesla or the Write Brothers would have been able to accomplish what they did by living paycheck to paycheck like most people do these days? Everyone Is scrambling to put a roof over their head and food on the table, not to mention clothes on their backs.
So anyway, to answer your question. Hoarding is not an issue.  Up until 1913 the US used gold as money and look where that got the US. Gold is deflationary which encourages saving (hoarding).
PS...I reserve the right to edit this post when I am sober.

I used [Zinc]( recently. Added items to my cart at newegg.com and chose Zinc at checkout. I saved a few $ from what neweggs cart quoted. My order was ultimately fulfilled by amazon.com and shipping took a few more days than usual.
They responded promptly to the couple of questions I had. You have to enter credit card info (real or fake) to get to the final step in neweggs cart before you can choose Zinc as payment.

download [bitaddress]( code and run it from a live linux distribution like [tails]( and print some BIP38 encrypted paper wallets and transfer your bitcoin from coinbase.com to the public keys you generated. Store copies of the paper wallets in various locations and for the love of jeebus don't forget your password.

Two weeks is an acceptable time frame for a BTC refund? If they would have responded to any of my attempts at communication I would have cut them some slack. But zero, ziltch and nada. They are theifs.

Age / Sex / Location. The mating call of the barely post-pubescant teenager. Typically the male initiates this signal, as an attempt to attract a female that can give an honest reply to his liking. More often, however, the male is fooled by another male, generally much older, who will impersonate his "dream girl" for his own sick, sadistic pleasure.
I'm whomever you want me to be, friend.

Armory uses little computer resources when running in offline mode. Practically any netbook will work fine running Armory offline. Perhaps using the "Offline Bundle for Ubuntu" installed on a flash drive would meet your needs. Use it on any computer that will boot from USB.

I don't trust my android phones security enough to do this. Scanning a private key with a device connected to the internet could pose a security issue. Some malware could intercept/store the key.

I used Armory briefly before to bloat kicked in and thought it was great. When they solve that issue, I think it'll be the go to wallet for most folks with more than 1 bitcoin. I experimented doing the offline signing of transactions and it was pretty intuitive.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:31:32
You are welcome. Nowhere near the 1 bitcoin the ATM tipped you, but I love to see people do the right thing ;)
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:17:44
Not exactly sure what you are trying to do. Since you mentioned coinbase, use their paper wallet import page and scan QR code if you have it or enter it manually. This will import your bitcoin into your coinbase account.

Run bitaddress.org from a linux live operating system on an offline computer. Enter the private key you want to check in the "Wallet Details" tab. The corresponding public address will be displayed and you can compare it with your paper wallet and check the balance on blockchain.info
    
I suggest using [Tails]( for this.

Interesting. After recently been cheated by all4btc.com i've been considering this business model:
offer any service/item and wait for unsuspecting prey to bite
they pay BTC for said service/item
the following day or two send a message saying that I can't fulfill my end of the bargain and then proceed to ignore them until the exchange rate of some arbitrary currency reaches a threshhold that is in my benefit and then execute a refund...profit!
 
I think I just stole the business model of all4btc.com
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:51:50
I don't know enough about Androids security model to trust it with private keys that will be used for long term storage, especially when the device can freely connect to the internet. 
   
The method I suggested of validating a private key does not expose it to a network connected device. Nothing about the key is written to disk and memory is wiped when Tails is shutdown.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:49:23
I'm having a horrible experiance with them right now. I used their service in an attempt to purchase from ebay. The auction expired or was won by someone else and I received and email that read ask if I wanted a refund or try for another item. I chose refund. After two weeks and a couple emails to support and a PM to i received a small fraction of the btc back that I spent. I think they are trying to refund the current euro/btc exchange rate. I payed approximatly .25 BTC, that is what I want back. I'm not satisfied with the .07 BTC I have been refunded. I have yet to receive any response to any attempt at communication with them.
I can not recommend their service based on my experiance so far.
