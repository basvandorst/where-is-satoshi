Would that make a 51% attack easier?

Just namedrop the super rich and famous university you work at, so people know you must really be scrambling for grant money.

    ldd /usr/bin/bitcoin-qt | grep ssl
That'll show it's using the shared libssl library, which [is OpenSSL](
Technically it could also include its own copy of OpenSSL (or even something else) and use that instead, but it doesn't. Probably the only way to confirm that definitively is to read the source.

For some reason, the package name for the shared library is libssl1.0.0 but the version number is 1.0.1.
This shows that libssl1.0.0 is a dependency of the main openssl package you probably noticed upgrading:
    apt-cache depends openssl
and this shows that libssl1.0.0 is actually version 1.0.1:
    apt-cache show libssl1.0.0
The shared library (from libssl1.0.0) is in the /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu folder. Look in /usr/lib/ssl and you won't see a shared library, just some other stuff like certificates.
...that being said, there's no harm in waiting if it makes you feel more comfortable.

Even if the dollar was no longer the "reserve currency", it wouldn't mean hyperinflation. Tons of non-dollar currencies exist without hyperinflation. You only get hyperinflation when a government decides that they are going to completely and utterly ignore any semblance of economic common sense. I can't see that happening in the US.

If inflation is constant, the dollar is never worth 0.

And also for misleading marketing that confused many people into thinking it was much more useful than it actually was, e.g. 
And also because 23andMe took the bold strategy of simply ignoring the FDA when the FDA tried to discuss these issues.
You may think that it's perfectly fine for companies to market bogus tests as predicting risk of cancer since the free market will somehow sort it out, but about 95% of the country would disagree with you.

I mean, yeah, if China decides they're going to invade the US then all kinds of bad stuff could happen. I'd be more worried about nuclear war than hyperinflation, though. Hard to see a scenario where hyperinflation would be a primary concern.


We've never done anything even remotely as stupid as what would be needed to cause hyperinflation. We don't need to be any more wise, we just need to not get a billion times stupider. Might as well be worried about what would happen if our next president decides to switch the national language to Esperanto and ban English. Yeah, it's not strictly impossible...
