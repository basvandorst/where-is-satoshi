You clearly don't know how blockchains work. The amount of increased work for a bigger block is negligable. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:53:48
Well, that is basically the first to market thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:50:31
Please quote the post i *specifically asked* that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:31:13
Well, how attractive is currency with insane fees that take forever to transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:11:44
How much did you lose in fees?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:44:25
How will Bitcoin ever work better for that than alts in the future? What other advantage does it have than being first to market?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:53:14


What do you mean by bigger nodes? More transactions per block? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:34:29
The fact that you talk about the roadmap like it's a single entity really shows how clueless you are. Next time you see someone asking for educated opinions, please stay away.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:59
Well, bitcoin has a long way to go to be seen as a safe, stable currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:38:02
So you don't mind bitcoin having no practical use?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:51
I mean, it's been around the longest, so yeah, obviously. That doesn't really address the problems though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:42:18


What exactly have the devs done lately, to improve bitcoin?


which is what?


How does that help the technology?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:31:41
Okay. Tell me how it's so much better than the alternatives then.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:58
What do you think nodes do?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:40:55
Hey! If you have 12 hours to kill in a café, you can buy a coffee with it!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:48:45
Well, true enough. I just don't see how much that is worth though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:54:38
The thought that I might have looked at it, but may disagree with you and want your opinion never struck you?
"Everything is best, but I won't tell you why" doesn't really offer much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:56:50
Well, hard to find when I didn't say it anywhere. 
I would argue that poor reading skills is indicative of poor parenting as well, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:30:59
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:12:15
1) So you are saying the transactions are slow on purpose? Why do people want the lightning network then?
2) Over The Top technology. 
3) Most environmentally aware people would care about wasting resources unnecessarily. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:39
Started listening to it. Could you give me some timestamps to where they address it, as it is quite long?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:09
In safety, i mainly consider the stability. If that ever happens I will be inclined to agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:47
No they really don't. More frequent equal size blocks doesn't really make any sense, as that just means transactions are being processed faster. AFAIK there are no restrictions as to how fast a block can processed.
Bigger blocks would reduce the computing power needed in the network, not increase it.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:07:09
More frequent blocks? That means smaller blocks. So both smaller and bigger blocks would lead to nodes where 


@_date: 2017-12-11 18:02:29
Okay, let me rephrase.
What exactly have the devs done, that makes you say they are better than all other development teams within crypto?
What part of the roadmap are you referring to? The 6+ hardforks coming this month alone? The upcoming Lightning Network? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:37:59
Lol. He doesn't address the problems at all. He want's bitcoin to be the new gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:32:50
Honestly though. You should learn this level of math in primary school.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:48
If it's not a get rich quick scheme, what can it be used for?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:21:15
No, I was asking for educated answers. By saying you'd have to do research, you are basically admitting you don't know what you are talking about. 
You sound like a person that lacks introspection. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:26
You can't really answer my questions, so you have to respond with "do some research". Good chat.
