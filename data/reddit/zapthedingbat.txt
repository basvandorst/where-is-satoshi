It's fascinating to see the intricacies of individuals and organisations dealing with crypto-currencies. I'm aware that there are some significant stumbling blocks to getting money in and out of crypto-currencies and GBP in the UK, this is probably true of many other countries and currencies.
To me, your comments regarding a multi-currency system would point to the idea of an abstraction to a "credit" that may not be directly pinned to a single currency, much like the "Facebook Credits". Of course by doing that you could, indirectly create something akin to another virtual currency. Although that would depend on how the value of the "credit" was determined against other currencies. Moving currency around has an associated cost so any transaction that could be deferred and offset against other transactions has a potential saving.
This raises the question of if you consider funds to be maintained in a central pot, or if the value of each individual flattr is maintained as a immutable asset of its recipient, until it is withdrawn.
It's also worth keeping in mind that bitcoin (BTC) is representative of only one of a multitude of "crypto-currencies" or "alt coins". If you are considering supporting BTC I would keep in mind LiteCoin, NameCoin, FeatherCoin to name just a few and the propensity (by there open-source nature) for more to appear and gain ground.
As a developer with a particular interest in emerging technologies I've written code to integrate with exchanges like btc-e.com. As others have mentioned, the technical aspects of working with crypto-currencies are considerably more simple than those of traditional currencies.
As a flattr user and with a personal involvement in crypto-currencies l'd be very happy to see any convergence between the two. I would consider an entirely separate beta platform, dedicated to a single currency as an acceptable minimum viable product that could be built upon over time.
