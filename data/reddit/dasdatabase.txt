Yes, and private keys on paper should be generated and printed completely offline. Rewrite printer's RAM by printing other files before connecting it to internet. You can create multiple paper wallets with different amounts. Cold storage. To spent scan QR with phone wallet and send wherever.

if you’re so principal about stealing, educate yourself about fractional reserve banking?

bank run!  Me like, nice timing with tether finex issues en binance hack. not your keys not your coins. stay safu.

yes that is true, and I hope by this edgy art the maker awakens more of those innocent everyday people, and thereby they educate themselves about sound money, not your pens, not your plastic.

Theft by fraction reserve banking? or are you really complaining about the plastic pens.? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:57:40
Maybe you’re right, but I interpreted the art piece as something that questions ownership of sound funds, and the fact we are discussing it means its great art.
If it was all about the pens and the plastic, the banks are doing a shitty job keeping our funds safu.?
Not your key not your coins.
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:25:03
I agree, but the proportions do matter a bit in this case I think. That’s part of what makes it such edgy art.?
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:27:42
Sure if it’s “hypothetical me” than I agree, maker is taking a risk. and I still like the piece.
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:10:40
Lol, I didn’t make it, all I been doing is talk about the piece of art with you, people will not be thrown in jail for looking at art and if so were going both..  haha
