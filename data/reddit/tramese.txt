no.  a typical NVIDIA GPU, say 1060, does about 20 MH/s
top end GPU's like 1080 Ti does about 35 MH/s

no....if all fiat currencies collapse to worthless, there would be no electricity, and any crypto/bitcoin is dead.

yep, RIP Satoshi.

look at venezuela....they destroyed their fiat and there's no order or electricity there...that's how the USA would look like if they destroyed the confidence of fiat.
the power grid goes offline and bitcoin is dead.

china's already started doing such a thing, called social credit.  it's not exactly there, but it's a step in that direction.  I fully agree what you're saying thats where we are headed.

@_date: 2019-04-08 22:07:02
you think there will be an electrical grid when the usa goes to war in world war 3 with nukes?
bitcoin is a hedge against government like gold.   if you go all the way back to dark ages, not even gold has value, only food.
let's hope we don't go that far.

if you're making a profit, keep some money in your bank (the amount that you *should* have), and nobody will be the wiser.
your money is yours, dont let anybody tell you what you should be doing, including your parents.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:47:08


stall until you're 18, and move out.  as long as you're under their roof, their rules.
keep your assets in crypto, nobody will know anyways.
I don't tell my parents either I trade crypto, i say stock market, which they understand more.  but i also don't live with my parents, so it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:04:04
it's easy to call anything, when you're not held accountable.  "oh, it must be a correction" blah blah blah.
make many calls, you're bound to get one right.
