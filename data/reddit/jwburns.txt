It’s headed to 4000k
But, whatever makes you feel better OP.

I have a really old Mac laptop that still functions.. it’s just an antique, but I wonder if that would still work for a hard wallet such as Ledger? And of course I have access to a computer at work if need be... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:21:03
Pump and dump my friend.. 
This puppy is on its way back to 1K. 
Short position all the way to the bank. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:15:27
I agree, me too. Just let me into the exchange to buy!

This is how I envision 90% of the “investors” on this sub..

You don’t need a loan. You need to get a fucking job. 
Suck it up buttercup and provide for your family. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:24:03
Rich.. as it comes crashing back down to 1K. 
Time to short. Watch and see. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:39:38
You mad snowflake? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:14:44
I wish it was a requirement that posters to this sub are forced to verify their position amounts before writing. Would weed out 99% of the losers on this forum. 
And the additional douchers who post about “lambos”

Cheap coins!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:59

Still dropping like a rock
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:09:16
Dipping all the way to 1K..
Hold on tight fellas!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:45:23
Yes. That growth was unsustainable. Especially with futures markets opening tomorrow.. It will be on sale soon enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:04:12
I’m praying for 1K per
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:56
These douche bag posts are getting old. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:26:34
Ok, I’ve seen the name Mycelium around on the sub.. I’ll check them out. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:41:02
Secretly hoping it hits 14K so I can buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:25:05
“I keep hearing”
Solid proof right there.

Are funds sitting in Gemini insured as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:10:28
I can’t even get into Gemini. 
Everyone is bailing.
