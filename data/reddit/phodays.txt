I think they are talking about it in the context of programming. Integrating bitcoin functionalities into softwares/websites etc.

Wow, when did this happen?
Also, which brand/manufacturer? 
Will definitely check it after work.

Jeez, how much did you end up losing? A friend of mine was planning on using them in the near future. Definitely should spread the word.

Thanks for the link, yeah I imagine its pretty similar here in AUS.
Storing biometric data for 5 years doesn't exactly make me comfortable though, especially when there are many other avenues of purchasing bitcoin that don't require such stringent practices.

Gmail does have the option for HTML viewing though, gets rid of most of the bloat.

In my particular university course most don't know of its existence. When I explain it to those in my circle of uni friends one of two things happen; 
1. They regard it cautiously, as if its some kind of Ponzi Scheme or financial witchcraft.
2. They just nod and smile as the technical explanation glides over them.
With that said my particular course is pretty "blokey", i'm sure there's a positive bitcoin presence in other faculties.

But yeah nah, at the moment i'm just using electrum, coinkite etc. with my paraphrase printed onto a few laminated teslin cards.

Sweet as, thanks for the heads up!
I usually get off at central, so I don't go through Wynyard often.
To think I've been heading into darlinghurst when I need to use a bitcoin ATM...

Seems quite risky for the developer.
And what would happen if a developer was chosen by the community for multiple jobs on overlapping time frames? Having to revote would cost time for the job posters and the donors.

While i think its a thoughtful idea for parents to pay digital allowance, I think there should be some consideration of the possible and probable security implications of letting children manage their own bitcoin wallet. I mean, there are still a lot of adults that find it difficult to keep their coins secure.

It may be worth checking if there is a Bitcoin ATM around your area. There may be an ATM provider such as BitRocket that doesn't require your SSN, retina scan and blood sample...

I imagine the reduced risk factor is attractive to criminals. At this point in time, If you rocked down to your local police station to report a "magic internet money" theft, I can't picture much help being sent your way.

All these free rides and discounts given to new and existing Uber users sound great for Uber and the users and makes for good marketing, but it seems it's effectively fucking over the drivers... e.g the protesting drivers in NYC.

OP or anyone else thats had a chance to use this service, care to elaborate on how the process works?
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:25:47
A few more benefits:
* No frozen funds or waiting for credit card escrow.
* No interest rates.
* Depending on selected bitcoin POS, no need to pay credit card terminal fees.
* Instant global transfer (useful for online businesses).
* Probably don't need PCI compliance.
* Progressive business image.

Never judge a book by it's cover, Never judge a blogs content by its design and appearance. 
While I completely agree with you cazalla662, and am completely fine with and prefer the simple, unbloated layout and structure of your blog, even against the wisdom of the adage above, some people are going to judge a book by its cover.
So why not cater for both groups, those who judge and those who don't, by providing and combining both your quality content and a slightly more aesthetic design?

The rates for bitcoin ATMs can vary. For most machines, the ATM owner can set the rate to whatever they want, and since in most cases the owner will be trying to break even the cost of purchasing the machine, the rates generally seem to be pretty high relative to other methods of purchasing bitcoin.
The amount of verification required depends on the machine, operator, country, AML/KYC compliance etc. So you'll just have to use your local machine and find out for yourself. Its generally a quick process though.

As usual there always Localbitcoins and the Mycelium Local Trader, but the prices can be pretty brutal. For an exchange, Coinjar is probably the way to go.

I think it would be wiser to invest your disposable income into bitcoin rather than most of it, especially as a humble glazier.
Also, i'm not sure what the ATM fees are in your area, but in my experience they have significantly higher fees relative to other means of obtaining btc, so you might want to look into some domestic exchanges etc. The ATMs are convenient though.
Regardless, good luck!
