Some of us have lost a lot and have nothing to lose.

wrong, average means average. Some will have zero some will have $100,000. It still works out to be the same.

I never really understood sidechains until now, thanks. With a lot of people wanting to use Bits 1/1000000 of a Bitcoin for the denomination, why not make a sidechain for bits with faster confirmation times and any  other benefits you would like to add. New bits are minted with proof of Bitcoins being locked up. You can now use bits for micro transactions and small purchases and use Bitcoins for large more secure transactions. You can get your Bitcoins back by proof of burning the equivalent amount of bits. The price stays pegged and you can move freely between both chains.

And it was also worth a thousand times less than what it is now.

I'm not worried about a double spend. If that ever happens, it would be just a small cost of doing business, but the zero transaction fee could be bad. I understand that most wallets have a standard fee but you can change that to zero. If at the end of the day I have $1000 dollars worth of bitcoins unconfirmed waiting to be entered into the blockchain, that would be a problem when I try to settle my other expenses with unconfirmed bitcoins. If people can buy something without adding a fee then they will and if miners ever decide not to put publish zero transaction fee transaction into the blockchain then I could see this as a major problem.

If its possible, I wouldn't even mind adding the fee on my end just to make sure the payment goes through as fast a possible.

Thanks a ton :)

You rock thanks. So a bitcoin key pair is really only as strong as the number of public key combination? I understand that it's still nearly impossible but I just want to clarify for myself.
