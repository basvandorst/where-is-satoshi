Yes, I think you are correct, good point! (Since no information is lost, the private key (32byte) stays the same)
But the compressed key wont have the nice form of vanitygen output anymore.

Pipe the output of "wif-to-ec" into "ec-to-wif" with -u flag for uncompressed.
But if I remember correctly, the compressed key will have a different Bitcoin address (due to hashing of the compressed EC point)

Seeing Andy Thinking doesnt bring me any further, even if it was a NICE MOVE! :P

Some hints (I am also stuck though!):
1. There is more than one post on bitcointalk. Hint for solving the first step there: Read the Whitepaper ; )
2. Reread the original post here for a different entry point.
3. There is a hint hidden on the facebook page. (no need to go to a subpage)

* Audacity to record the sound and measure the bit-rate or the length of one bit
* Mathematica to import and sample the file, fourier transform the bits to extract the bit sequence
* Also Mathematica for finding the repeating pattern (I just tried different partitions of the bitsequence and different offsets and plotted the distribution of numbers to find that a windows of 10 bits was the right one). It offers many functions to shuffle data, so I could also get the WIF key in the end.

Hehe :D
With these puzzles I am always so excited, even if its just 1mBTC or less. Never managed to grab the reward though till today.

I really love these kind of riddles, have participated in many and here is what I really miss on your site:
* I would really like to see the solutions, once they are solved. Sometimes I invested time in riddles, couldn't solve them, but would love to see the solution.
* Discussion!!! The (for me) key point of riddles!! It's so much more fun to see people think, sometimes cooperate, ideas and stuff. Makes it much more alive (like it is right now I dont really now if the site is dead).
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:02:56
You're welcome!
The site really feels more alive now :) Good job!

I found it!!
It was encoded with an asynchronous serial communication protocol. 
* I extracted the bits via discrete fourier transformation over the time windows of bit-length
* I found that there is a repeating pattern of bits every ten bits
* Between these repeating patterns, 7 bits of data were sent. That's were I was stuck for hours.
* Reversing the bitorder (d'oh!!) of these 7 bits lead to the private key!
Thanks so much for this puzzle! I actually learnt about the serial data communication encoding because of this!!

Phew, that was me. Sorry ;) (But now we both won, congrats!!)
I was sooo pumped as it took me some time to sweep it. Thank you so much, coreyp57 for this! Was quite an adventure :D!!
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:08:44
Cool :)
And btw: I like the concept and the site is beautiful! Totally forgot to say that and my comment sounded so negative. Sorry ;)
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:10:24
What is your bitcoin address ;) ?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:53:24
That was fun!! Thanks a lot :)!
Havent seen such a clever and well designed puzzle for a while. Kudos!

You gave us the info that it is a minikey. I then assumed that it is 30 bytes long. The encrypted data is 35 bytes long, so the last 5 bytes of Block 5 must be: 0800000000. By XORing Block 5 with Block 4 and XXYY0800000000 you get the last 40 bits of the 56-bit key. A minikey starts with an "S". By XORing the first byte of (IV), (Block 1) and 0x53, you get the first 8 bits of the key. The remaining 8 bits can be bruteforced by for example checking the validity of the decrypted data for a valid minikey.
So thats why I said "well designed": It is a lot of fun to deduce this and to step-by-step arrive at the solution. Its not a boring "all or nothing" puzzle where you either find the solution or you dont.

Ahaaaa!! Now I get it :) Thanks!
So I had figured out this algorithm, but I think there are 2^4 possible ways of using it per type of square!
Example: the top left one: upper right quadrant: you can either say: all bits upper part are UNSET and continue with the bottom row. OR you can say: all bits lower part are SET, so continue with upper row. This introduces ambiguities (more subtle for the other squares). Then you can interpret black as 0 or 1 for top/bottom and left/right. So 2^4 possibilities per square (so 16^4). And then inverse/not inverse of bits: another factor of 2. This led me to give up :D
Thanks for the riddle!
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:23:26
Thank you for the puzzle!
I am lost though... I think I have an algorithm to extract a private key (all the bits of it), but I am lacking the interpretation or parameters of the algorithm:
Is black a 0 or 1, do the different "ways of reading a square" translate to different parameters, which is the significant bit, what order are the squares in...
There are just too many possible ways of interpretation : (

Thank you so much for the entertaining riddle!
Took very long (hours!!) to try out so many different combinations and in the end I didnt believe in it anymore ;) But it was fun while it lasted!
Looking forward very much to the next of its kind ;)!!
Finally I can go to sleep :P!

I would first backup all data from the stick before you try stuff.
Then: Download a current electrum version and use it to open the default_wallet file from the stick (the file isnt necessarily called default_wallet, but the principle is the same)
File &gt; open
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:51:00
It most probably wasnt your client signing and broadcasting the transaction but your keys were exposed and stolen somewhere (else). The transaction can be generated from anywhere, your client picks up this transaction (as it is connected to the bitcoin network) and finally informs you about the transaction, because it knows, that these are your coins.
Sorry for your loss :( Now proceed with securing everything you have and try to narrow down how your keys were stolen. Change your passwords (from a secure PC), scan your computers, etc etc
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:07:34
Dont use an older version. Use a current version to open the default_wallet file via File &gt; Open (See my other post). The wallet file is saved on the stick.
@_date: 2016-09-06 07:24:39
No, i mean the actual wallet file in the new electrum.
If it is encrypted, send it via mail to yourself ;) (or pack it into an encrypted zip file)

Solution to the first challenge:
Reverse the string. Take the numbers and convert them to ASCII.

The 7 is strange. Well... or the 1.
