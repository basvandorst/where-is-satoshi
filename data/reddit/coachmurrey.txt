It would be an incredibly sudden drop in difficulty in addition to apparent hashrate growth. Also, it takes over a month for the attack to be profitable, so it would be spread over two adjustment periods at least. It's not worth it for BTC Guild to perform a selfish attack at all.
@_date: 2014-01-01 16:55:41
We would notice before that strategy was actually being used by BTC Guild, the orphan rate of the network would increase and the difficulty would probably decrease by at least 20%.

USD will hopefully be dethroned as a world reserve currency. Single companies (with government mandates) should not be able to determine who gets to participate in gigantic portions of the nation's economy. There aren't even laws being broken when they block Wikileaks, this shop or several other businesses and people they've walled off.
These capital controls will become counter-productive as alternative currencies provide an escape from arbitrary financial oppression.

So this is how bitcoin dies.
Not talking about the blacklists of course, talking about the influx of new users. Easy pray for conspiracy theories, faux outrage, kneejerk reactions. 
If people in this subreddit actually understood what was at stake (namely, that these blacklists have nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol, that it's people in the community declaring their own lists and trying to get others to enforce them) perhaps we could focus our attention toward ways to improve bitcoin's privacy and fungibility. Like, CoinJoin implementation in standard wallet software.

You will have to use a third party ledger, but the ledger just needs to process the transactions independent from the rest of the network. This doesn't necessarily require trust though: you can use fidelity bonds and other tricks with the transaction scripting system to enforce certain behaviors provably on operators of ledgers outside of the blockchain.

The reason why is some articles are posting an ICE seizure notice used on some other website. They probably googled "ICE domain seizure" and saw these pictures.
FBI/ICE made a custom seizure page for the Silk Road with "THIS **HIDDEN** SITE HAS BEEN SEIZED". But since most people in the media don't know Tor from their asshole there's no way for them to get the real image.

It's really stupid, because that just masks the potential of an attack. They could just immediately stop redirecting hashrate to other pools and perform an attack.

That's not a replacement for authentication. X.509 is used because we need a way to trust a third party is who he says he is, and the only way we currently know how to do that is by knowing their public key already (non-intuitive) or by relying on a chain of trust of some kind to discover/verify the key.
End-to-end encryption is not what we're trying to accomplish here.

People are completely misinterpreting it. It's useful and interesting discussion about a theoretical idea-- the same discussions we've been having about every other possible thing you can do with Bitcoin. Mike has had a large part in those discussions.
Bitcoin survives on its own merit, it does not depend on us to avoid discussion of certain topics. Set intersection protocols to solve the problem Mike is talking about is *interesting*. We can fantasize over how it would work, *and come up with reasons why it wouldn't*. Keep in mind SCIPs and fidelity bonded ledgers and other concepts make "decentralized crimefighting" impractical. And we know that now because we had the discussion.
And in the other post Mike is trying to ask "what do we do if governments try to attack Bitcoin's fungibility" assuming that hashpower is concentrated into farms in the future. What exactly is wrong with his post?

A smaller pool will find blocks slower but not necessarily find *less* blocks (per hashrate). You will earn just as much over time mining on p2pool. People just don't like it because they want to see the money flow immediately.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:06:16
ASICMINER is not in the business of selling equipment. That's just incidental. friedcat's original post on the matter expected a "price war" to flood the market with unprofitable hardware, and it appears to me that his intentions are to build a massive manufacturing infrastructure for ASIC mining devices for his own mining activities instead.
The future of mining will not be in selling these units, as they eventually will be worthless especially after shipping costs. The future is mining with them, or contracting out their operation through franchising models that friedcat has developed, and ASICMINER's expected gen2 hardware pipeline is expected to be in the petahashes.
Furthermore, the ability to produce hashrate at 55/65nm dwarfs that of any "3rd gen" tech currently being produced, such as Cointerra's hardware. Sure, they'll be ahead of the game in terms of efficiency, but in China where electricity costs are low and space is plentiful, friedcat should have no problem taking a huge bite out of the next 6-10 months worth of mining revenue with less efficient chips. He can make more of them much faster.

Back when bitcointalk was first growing, you could make posts like Mike's just to explore strategies, game theory, technical decisions, and other theories related to cryptocurrency without being so afraid that your idea would scare the shit out of people and make them hate you.
What he described was a novel technical idea and you guys are a bunch of pricks with zero perspective. He's not trying to push it onto bitcoin, and he posted it to get constructive discussion which could inspire other ideas.
For example: if we don't come up with these ideas, we'll never know how to make them impractical or study their effects until it's too late.
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:06:36
That's because the public key is hashed into the address, which is the equivalent of how bitcoin addresses function already. That does not allow us to authenticate who owns a bitcoin address, especially when each purchase will result in a new bitcoin address.

You're missing the point. When the community starts turning against itself, it can't get anything done, it can't have any effective advocacy, and bitcoin will be vulnerable to regulatory/political efforts against it. We're throwing ourselves under the bus.

You've misunderstood his idea. It's not a change to bitcoin, it's an abstraction independent from bitcoin that *users* participate in voluntarily (or through force by the government). It is certainly NOT a proposal to change anything in bitcoin, and indeed the fungability of coins from bitcoin's perspective is maintained.
Say some merchants start rejecting any TxIns spending coins from transaction hashes which end in 0xfff -- that would not affect fungability. It is those merchants making arbitrary changes to how they behave outside the network. The network will still process the transactions.

I'm sorry but this is possible without Mike's idea. A government could declare certain addresses "terrorist related" and force everyone to refuse/report activity related to it, in the same way they impose KYC regulations on merchants. It's exactly what we've been scared of for years.
Mike's idea tries to take a different angle on the problem. It describes a decentralized protocol to influence merchants, making crime fighting decentralized. This takes away power from central law enforcement agencies and places it within a free market of coercion. That doesn't sound too appealing, but think anarcho-capitalist "[private defense agencies]( if you're so inclined.

The government will pursue regulations regardless, it's important to have a voice to act as a force against excessive or otherwise non-existent regulations. It's not as if the Bitcoin Foundation is acting as an authority. It's acting as an educational body.
Merely ignoring regulators or ignoring the government and allowing it to act against cryptocurrencies or anonymity networks through blind ignorance will do needless damage. This is the purpose of the foundation.

It would be easier for the government to make USD better than to ban bitcoin, which could be part of bitcoin's legacy.

The fungibility of the coins is not being changed, the coins are being marked as proceeds from crime (from one or more known entities) which merchants can voluntarily use to assist those entities in identifying criminals. The coins are not seized or locked in any way and they're not worth less because they're marked -- at least, no different in the sense that a government could use the same authority to outlaw bitcoin all-together with similar effect.
Keep in mind the entire idea is voluntary and doesn't require any modifications to bitcoin to implement, it's possible a government would come up with a similar idea. Why not discuss it in advance?
That's besides the point anyway, the actual technical idea (using a private set intersection protocol to anonymously identify marks on coins without giving away your identity) is very interesting and theoretical. It could be applied to other concepts and ideas.
In addition, he had an entire section of his post dedicated to describing how governments could abuse it and how consumers would react to such a system, and admitted he had no solutions. Perhaps we could find one (preventing coercion) while still allowing decentralized crime-fighting to exist. Not in this community it seems.
