So I create an account to let you know why I trust KnC and you just throw my comment out like its worthless. I actually have no reason to lie about anything I was just being a good community member.  , here is a snap of my cex.io mining power the worker ka5050ro.s is my KnC Saturn, there will be a TerraMiner IV also hashing here this month as well,  proof of purchase.

if the Dollar collapses the entirety of the US would have to adopt BTC but BTC value would become the US Currency. so BTC in the US would be equal to BTC so we would value it at what was needed so 1BTC would be worth probobly more than a million or so due to the fact everyone would need to use the new technology. but this is pretty far off if it were to ever happen

Here is a good way to look at it, companies likr cex.io exist and make.profit not by mining but selling shares of hashing power, as long as this exists the network will never go down regardless of actual miners

I would trust KnCMiner with all money. Not only do they ship on time they overdeliver on performance. We ordered a Saturn and it hashes at 334ghash instead of the 250ghash this company by far the best miner company to buy from

It's called the funds availability policy. The banks already have a disclaimer about not having the money to begin with so a lawsuit would fail. So with that being said, of everyone decided to close their bank accounts it would be impossible, since banks ru, on imaginary digital money when you pay with your debit card imaginary funds are withdrawn from your account and put into their account and payment is successful, the funds only actually become real when someone wants to have the money in hand.

I think coinbase might be able to come up with a solution, and also a lot of wallets are able to request payment via email. So what you would be looking to do is an email requesting payment, then you need to give an amount of days to get the payment done say 3-5. So if payment isn't recieved by the amount of days then subscription suspended until payment is completed.
