For people in the United States one way to do limited trading of Bitcoins is to use a method that I am currently using. It has its limitations but in the long run it could help you save your self from yourself. First thing you do is buy a 1TB or 2TB external hard drive, to hold your hard drive wallet, both are under 100 dollars. You then download the full block chain, I know, I know, time consuming, but kind of worth it in my opinion.
From there:
1- Find a business with business cards. Grab four cards and use the content of the business card as your encryption password. Put one card in your wallet. One with your important papers. Store one card with a flash drive that has your wallet data backed upped, in a sandwich bag. The last one, your choice.
2- Open a circle account. Circle allows you to send or receive bitcoins from addresses. Circle can be linked to a debit card with a 3000 dollar a week transfer amount.
3- When bitcoins dip to a level you are comfortable with, buy 3000 dollars worth of bitcoins through Circle which you send directly to your hard drive wallet. Now you can not use Circle again for one week since you maxed out your transfer limit. However, after 7 days or when bitcoins rise to a level you want to sell at. You send 3000 dollars worth of bitcoins through Circle from your hard drive wallet, directly to your debit card. The money appears in your checking account shortly after midnight.
4- The difference from your trade remains in your hard drive wallet, Which you can withdraw after 7 more days or leave it in there to avoid any tax obligations. 
Your hard drive wallet is anonymous, so if you use a different address to send to your hard drive wallet no one but you will easily know who you sent the money to. For wealthy people this is probably a pain in the butt. But for average people it is a way to make a few extra dollars, four or five times a year.

Bitcoin is just a moniker. It is the underlying technology that needs to become mainstream. Which it has, but most people who should be aware of it, are not. The banks and other financial firms are looking into it. Which actually means they are busy modifying it for their use.
With the ethereum debacle, financial institutions received the final piece of the puzzle to fully adopt the blockchain. They finally know that if they have one main or central blockchain for an industry, they can mitigate any institutional losses by transferring them to the ordinary user. Even if the ordinary user were holding their funds on their own computer or cellphone and just using the blockchain to conduct commerce. The institutions could ban together raise transaction fees and hardfork the blockchain. Then charging a high fee for non institutional account holders to re access the blockchain.
I did not want a debit card. They forced it on me and did not charge me to use it for a couple of years. Then they linked all kinds of fees to it.
I did not ask for mobile banking. It to was free for a while. Now they are starting to charge for using it with fees equal to ATM charges.
So the blockchain usage will be forced on the people. And when it has been adopted. They will nickel and dime the ordinary people to death. With the occasional financial crisis to really bilk the ordinary person out of their hard earned money.

Bitcoin can not function without the state. The internet is the state, the fiat currency which Bitcoin derives its value from is the state, banking and tax laws are the state. Bitcoin is not some isolated entity with no contact with the real world. Bitcoin can function somewhat independently inside the greater state. But in order to serve its function it must interact with the state, the real world. Those points of interaction will need some kind of supervision, integrity. If Bitcoin or any altcoin is to survive.

The problem with this statement is. That it is not separating the operating environment of the Bitcoin blockchain. From the on and off ramp of fiat currency to that environment. If Bitcoin ever becomes it own currency with little reliance on our normal fiat currencies. Then it could and should operate as distributed trust. However until the on and off ramps to the Bitcoin blockchain become ubiquitous and mining as an option is reintroduced to anyone running a full node. The Bitcoin ecosystem can be subjected to unfair manipulation. Which is what I think Coinbase is doing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:56:18
The time to buy is when the unconfirmed transactions drop below 10000. Because that will signal bitcoin is usable again as currency,  and not as some speculative store of value.

I like your post. Holders of Bitcoin are totally unaware of how useless Bitcoin has become for commerce. Which is what Bitcoin's first best destiny is or was. Almost 12 days later on New Years eve my transaction was completed. With a $150 loss in value. $14 was only good enough to get confirmed in 12 days. I'm just one person but I am shutting down my full node, already converted to Litecoin and made a $25 purchase with 7 cent tx. Bitcoin probably will not go away, but at this point it is on its way to becoming the British empire.
Funny thing about that whole video, is what he was saying, I think with out realizing it. Is that Bitcoin if not all crypto currencies are going to need a governance body of some kind, to survive and prosper.

I think Bitcoin has proven something very important. That money or currency can be handle in a way, that does not require micro management by any one financial institution. However it is now failing at the one thing you can not fail at if people are going to use you as a financial institution. You cannot deny them the ability to use their funds at a reasonable price or a timely manner. If anything, Bitcoin has shown the financial industry that they can create a universal currency, independent of any one nation. Of course if they do that they will have to openly base the currency on productivity and the cost of productivity. That will include the cost of mining and or farming of materials. And that will disrupt the world's economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:36:57
This begs a question, is Bitcoin the My Space/Yahoo/AOL of the digital age? It is truly one of them, or some combination of all. It got there first with a lot of potential. All would be good if they would have responded to the effects that greed has on any monetary system. 
There are institutions who have been around monetary systems long before Bitcoin. They saw the strengths and weakness of the overall system and have manipulated it to the point of failure. They have profited greatly from its rise and will profit from the fall. And will reign supremely as their blockchain rise from the ashes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:23:07
Well, if that is true, then Bitcoin is overvalued by at least 90%. I now believe satoshi made the greatest mistake a person can make when dealing with finance. He totally underestimated the genius of greed. Greed is like water, it always finds a way.

What some Americans need to know is that Coinbase is not considered a US banking institution. It is foreign based and all funds they send to you are listed as foreign. My bank put me under a security audit earlier this year after my association with Circle and Coinbase. They changed all of my cards. Now any time I want to send money to Coinbase they require I call for a temporary lift of a ban on overseas transactions. Even though Coinbase say they are based in California, that is not true from a banking standpoint.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:24:43
Well one core purpose is a complete failure. Bitcoin is the most centralised currency their is. The past month has proven just how much control a small group has over one product. And just how damaging having incompetent and or greedy people control something that has a value can be. So will everyone stop with the Bitcoin is decentralised because that is one thing it surly isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:18
Well I have finally landed in the camp of Bitcoin has won the battle but lost the war. The fees are insane and totally against normal economics. The thing you are getting paid in, to mine has gone up in value over 2000%, while your cost to mine has stayed flat or decreased over the past year, begs the question? Exactly what are all the transactions taking place for?
Because when 9$ dollars to move $20 dollars takes 6 days, bitcoin is not fit for commerce. It becomes nothing more than a Tulip. Once companies see the viability of cryptocurrency, which many have, bitcoin will not be their first or second choice. If it takes almost a week to get confirmation that you can ship a $20 item to a person, which they actually paid $29 for. Your currency is screwed.
In my small world three companies are now working on other coins. Once people start to use those other coins with much lower fees and much faster confirmation times bitcoin is dust because all it will have to offer is that it was the first to make it into the mainstream. But not the best there is.
Even as an investment bitcoin is over mature. Because the competition is better at what a currency should do. Which means anything that bitcoin can do to get better they can also, if they have not already done so, and their upside of growth is now much greater than bitcoin. 
Bitcoin, you are the dinosaur, too big to adapt quickly enough to the changing climate.     
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:21:28
You are so right. If I had just seen the Big Short. Bitcoin would be freaking me out by now. Bitcoin's value was rooted in its ability to buy things, everyday things, illegal things. The point is it was for hassle free commerce. That is the true value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is now  being used as an wealth building asset, which is the problem now. People are simply pumping bitcoin as an value asset and they are pumping the tx's. Both of these things are not sustainable, but all that matters to the people doing the manipulation is that they are getting rich at the expense of holders, even though the holders don't know it yet. I have been using Bitcoin since 2015. That has ended, I am trying to move my remaining money from my hardware wallet at a reasonable price. Then I will shut down my full node, my computer will be grateful for all the gig's that will be freed up. In short if you can not buy anything at a reasonable price with Bitcoin, its value is pretty much useless.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:29:11
Thank you for this post I have been writing something like this in my head for about three days now. When $8.80 will not allow $20.00 to be confirmed, there is a problem. I for one was not an investor in bitcoin, I actually used it for commerce. But at this point it is useless for commerce.
 
At this point I am just waiting for another currency to become more widely accepted. There are a few companies with foreign processors of credit cards which my bank refuses to deal with. So bitcoin was a good solid option. Now a couple of those companies are telling people they are sorry for the high fees associated with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:13
To be honest when the fees drop enough I am moving my bitcoin to Ethereum and Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:27
I am not really sure what you are saying. But my best guest can only yield this answer. There are many fiat currencies in the world today, with the US dollar being considered the best. However the Yen, Pound, Euro and Marks are also very good currencies. There are a few good reason why the dollar at the moment is the reigning currency. 
When it comes to cryptocurrency, it is clear what the most dominating factors to success will be. Number of outlets accepting the currency, ease of use, validation of security, cost of use, confirmation of transaction.
Unfortunately for bitcoin the blockchain and the security of it is becoming relative routine. Which means it will have to compete on acceptance, which it clearly has the lead for now. But when it comes to cost of use and confirmation times bitcoin is way behind the curve. In fact it will only take a few fortune 500 companies to promote another coin beside bitcoin to sink it's value by 90%.
Bitcoin was in trouble when in 2016, the blocks were being filled with an amazing number of small transactions which forced people doing normal commerce to increase their tx. Which now seems like it was a test run for today's situation. People trying to get a little Christmas cash are being royally screwed, even if they bought months ago and are still in the black. And retailers who were starting to really rely on bitcoin are very frustrated, so when they make the turn to another crptocurrency, they will do better research into the only variables that matter with this type of currency. And that will not bode well for bitcoin.

I agree it is the future. I just firmly believe that Bitcoin is not the future. It will linger on for sure. Bitcoin can not be what it is supposed to be which is a highly liquid currency.  A $137 cost per transaction with a 200000 plus backlog is a black stain, that will never fade. It does not matter what the developers do. Smart people looking at this will see what they can do much better and someone will. They will point to this period in time to prove to the right people that the bitcoin developers and their blockchain are woefully inadequate.

I think this is problem with some people defending Bitcoin at the present. This problem of unconfirmed transactions reared its head in mid 2016. Back then people were complaining about 10000 plus unconfirmed transaction. Not because they could not trade fast enough, but because they could not buy stuff in a timely manner. I have been using bitcoin since late 2014 not to invest but to buy legal stuff. That is something I can no longer do.

What you want to do is manually replace the new wallet.dat file file with the old one. Keep in mind that if you encrypted your data after restarting bitcoin, you will need the password to move the coins. 
Also 2013 is a long time ago. Depending on when you bought your bitcoins $200 dollars could be worth close to $1000 dollars or more. Also the block chain is close to 100 gigs now. So good luck in catching up with the block chain.

I was just about to go to sleep when I read this. This caused me much distress. I quickly went to my circle cellphone app and retrieved and address. Which I was able to send the max dollar amount to Circle, from my desktop bitcoin client. 
I have auto update turned off on my phone and there is a circle update in there. Which I will not update until I can remove more bitcoins through Circle, if I can. 
I have read the Circle comments from Circle.com. What I am not 100% sure of is. Whether Circle will act as a go between for financial institutions and the bitcoin network. That is, allow you to send dollars to a bitcoin address and receive money from bitcoin addresses, and just not store funds in the bitcoin form.
If they are just getting out of the storage business but maintaining there exchange services, then I still have a use for them. I have been hording bitcoins for an investment, which has performed nicely this year for me. Before using Circle mid year I was using an bitcoin atm, where the usage rates were near criminal.

That is what happened to me last night. Sent money to an address at the recommended rate. A few minutes later I decided to send money else where and the recommended fee was about 4 times higher. That first transaction is still unconfirmed about 14 hours later. Checked this morning on the recommended fee and it was at 17 cents. Which is still much higher than my unconfirmed transaction fee.

As simple as I can get it. Think of a blockchain as a private domain name. Call it .blockchainX. A group of banks get together and create a app that connects only to .blockchainX. You down load the software from your financial institution of choice and run it on your device of choice. 
Now if you downloaded it from your bank a lot of the hard work will be done for you. The app will probably ask would you like to move money in the .blockchainX, you would say yes and enter the amount. Then like bitcoin it would give you some private keys to identify your transaction and specific account. 
Their blockchain would work much like bitcoin. Except the miners would be replace by hundreds or thousands of computers located in financial institutions. The blockchain would have set prices on transactions. Say 50 cents for 1$ to $1000 transactions. These prices would be set in stone. So any retailer would know the exact cost of sending or receiving money over the blockchain. Just like bitcoin you could chose to carry the full database of transactions or you could just rely on a central ledger kept by the banking institutions.
Because this is not a decentralize system like bitcoin. Your bank will know who you are at all times from your unique address. It will also know what unique private keys you use to send money. It will not know your encryption key which allows you to send money. They will have the ability to block at any time any money you try to receive or send.

If I sent 10,000 dollars at .20 increments for .01 to my phone wallet from my desktop wallet. That is 50,000 transactions, if they were all confirmed it would cost 500 dollars. Chances are they would over time get confirmed. However they would sit in the backlog for a few days.

Everybody keeps thinking that Circle has given up on bitcoin. It is just the opposite. They have built a fully transparent UI on top of bitcoin. 
From Circle:
We have never been focused on convincing consumers to replace their familiar native currencies with bitcoin, but instead wanted to bring the benefits of public blockchains and digital assets to consumers without requiring them to know the technical details. We made progress on that over the past year as we launched our social payment app in the US, UK, and parts of Europe, enabling direct payments across currencies, and also allowing people to send local currency to other digital wallets over the Bitcoin blockchain. This ‘hybrid digital money’ model has been in our sights for a long time.
We’re taking another major step forward today with the introduction of Spark, a set of protocol additions that provides a way for digital wallets to exchange value using blockchains, including Bitcoin, as settlement layers. There are many use cases for the technology, but the initial focus is on connecting digital wallets around the world while ensuring that full KYC/AML and compliance requirements can be met, and presenting a seamless experience that reflects local currency exchange rates and conversion rule contracts.
We plan to release Spark as an open source project that anyone in the world can use and implement, and intend to work closely with similarly-minded ecosystem participants to advance the technology and integrate it with additional public and private blockchains.

Bitcoin is operating in the real world of finance. Which means when it comes to working with large amounts of data, averages are used. Your point is valid, but in the business world you tend to err to the high side probability of success.

You get what you pay for is still a strong selling point in the business world.

This is why Bitcoin is in a death spiral. Simple protocols which were suppose to be a part of system failed miserably. The fact that so many transaction were being rebroadcast by someone or something is shameful. All the problems with bitcoin pale in light of the ability to hold someone's money in a virtual limbo, with that person being completely powerless to remedy the situation. Bitcoin-qt has failed miserably during the past few months. The feature to remove a transaction from the mempool failed. The option to limit the time in the mempool failed. The built in 2 week mempool kick out failed. So many foreseeable problems with bitcoin were ignored, now the problems have condemned bitcoin to a slow death.

There are signs if you understand financial markets in general. A positive sign to start buying again is if, the 24 hr stat of, [Cost per Transaction (USD) x % Earned From Transaction Fees] is less than 50 cents (usd). That will signal that bitcoin no matter the price is usable for normal commerce again. If it never reaches that metric, then stay far away from bitcoin.

If the Petro was to become viable, it would be the closes thing representing what all currencies represent.  All currency is, is a way to mesure the use of energy to accomplish something.  Given the laws of energy, if you could peg a coin to a single barrel of verified mined oil.  Then you would have something. Imagine if all currency was based on a nation's energy generating output. What ever nation could generate the most usable energy at the lowest amount of effort, would rule the world. With banking or storing large amounts of energy increasing the value of a nations currency also.

Funny thing about the replies I am getting, is that they seem to ignore the 800lb. Gorilla in the room. That being, is there one major or minor site, that does not display most of its data as averages. I am not saying they do not offer other charts and data stats with median numbers. But almost all go with averages. Median stats have uses for sure, but in my very limited view, when people or organizations break out the median stats, they are usually trying to hide an ugly truth. Either on the high end or the low end.

Announcing fee sat/byte may be good for some people, but for most people, the only number that matters is [Cost per Transaction (USD) x % Earned From Transaction Fees]. 
After the past 2 months, that is the magic number to make sure your transaction makes it through. Anything below that falls into the wishful thinking category. And when comes to getting bitcoin from point A to point B, most of us know how painful wishful thinking can be.

If it drops to below $1, then I will consider using bitcoin again. But I have not run my full node in over a month. Because of all the ridiculousness of the transaction fees and stuck transactions.

I do not know how everyone's accounts are set up. For me I get a no fee message when I transfer money using my debit card. When I used the checking account there is a small fee. So I send bitcoins to my desktop wallet using the debit card and it cost nothing. Also send bitcoins to my debit card at no fee.

One neat trick that I like about circle, is that if you link a debit card. You can transfer funds to your debit card and the funds appear there after midnight. If you link it to a regular checking account the money can take up to five days especially if you do the transfer on a Friday.
