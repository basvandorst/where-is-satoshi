Already in, but with the price rise high value many people haved questions about it. When you talk about international bank decentralised it’s seems be the best idea of our time for everyone but when you add a little *just put what you are willing to lose the majority just see DANGER DONT DO IT.
I think if we promote the bitcoin like an asset and not like a new mondial bank system we loose the first idea of this project, no?

I’m fan of a french band called Stupeflip, the singer “King Ju” has a mask since the beginning of the band so a little mystery about is face is setting up. He has a lot of white shirt with nihilist message write in black in all his clip and show, and a lot of rumors says he is was spotted many times  in small bar in Paris with a t shirt with just “ Je suis King Ju “ ( I am King Ju ) but not wearing his mask and he can walk with nobody recognize him.

Just use a crypto account with credits card and send what do you need on it. It’s made automatically on the fiat you need, not perfect because of fiat but it’s help a lot of my friends and family to see it’s viable in 2019 to only have crypto and maybe perceive more than the market fluctuations ect. 
Can’t be paid in crypto on my country so I have a main account and I send what I need on my crypto account. Crypto card I have works in every country I have visited since 1 years and it’s help me to avoid a lot of fees I paid normally with my other cards. Only the withdraw in cash who are over taxed but I don’t really use cash a lot so ...
A lot of company have crypto cards and I don’t know if mine is the best of all so I let you make your own research and opinion.
