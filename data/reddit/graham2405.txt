The Exchanges are market makers. They are providing a derivative that will allow investors to short or go long on Bitcoin without owning any Bitcoin.
It will provide liquidity to the market and should 'ultimately' provide some stability.

Every transaction is held by everyone with a copy of the blockchain. The minute you use it to buy something or just transfer from BTC to FIAT you could then be associated with that account number.
So, by buying something from Amazon (maybe one day, maybe, maybe) they then can associate you with every transaction you ever made with bitcoin with that account number.
Also every exchange is keeping records of those who buy and sell, and the US government has already won a court case to get access this data. The UK is also about to do the same.
Privacy, really?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:46:20
Err No.....
What is it's true worth?
What someone is prepared to pay for it, that's it's true worth. Or alternatively what goods can you exchange it for, given that it's supposed to be a currency.
So, would you buy it @ $15,000, $25,000, or $50,000, $100,000?
Because plenty of people will have to if it's going to get there.
Suggest you google 'greater fool theory'. Because I do not believe that enough greater fools exist.
if you can't see the fool that you are going to sell it to then that fool is you.

Bitcoin is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it, period, there is no tangible value whatsoever. it's the 'greater fool theory' personified.
The price rises with demand, and rises quickly due to limited supply. 
Please don't tell me about the technology..... Blockchain clearly has value, but Bitcoin is just a currency that uses the blockchain system to secure transactions.
Tulip bulbs had high demand and limited supply, and some colours were very rare.
Tulips at least had some tangible value, they flower and you can eat the flowers.........if hungry enough.

I'm just guessing that when the music stops there will be no chairs.......
It may have made a great currency, but speculation and lack of use for it's intended purpose (slow transactions, large fees and lack of acceptance haven't helped) has probably destroyed Satoshi's 'dream'.

What it means is that they are so concerned that they are going to increase the required margin to trade.
They want a margin (they money you have to deposit, effectively) of 33% has increased to 44%
It has nothing whatsoever to do with assets and bitcoin market.
It is all to do with RISK.
They are trying to protect themselves from an huge crash (more likely), or rise.
Simply put if bitcoin was to collapse anyone going LONG would lose a shitload of money, they want to make sure that they have most of this money upfront. Hence the 44% margin.
IT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.........
Also, it was noted in the Financial Times that advance notice of the Futures Contracts may have led to price manipulation (upwards), Clearly if you could manipulate the price up, you could then short the shit out of it once the futures contracts are opened.
The BIG question, is this the reason for the meteoric rise over the last few weeks?
Has a syndicate been in the market pumping the price ahead of the futures going live. Clearly the futures providers are concerned.

That's why the tulips comparison is used, bitcoin has no real value, it's only worth what you can sell it for.

This is a bubble.

"Futures in the real world are usually bought by people that actually deal with the product in question (e.g a farmer that puts 10% of his profit in futures, shorting his own corn)"
Historically this was the origin of Futures.......
But now they are a derivative that allows an investor to speculate on the price of the underlying asset or commodity. Very, very few people use them for the original purpose.
"Why he does that? because he will make a lot of money selling his corn if the prices go up and will only lose on those 10%. On the other hand those 10% work like a fluffy cushion in case that a fucking meteor lands on top of his crops."
Yes this was the origin of futures, not anymore though.......
"Now, let’s think, who would do that in bitcoin world? Miners! They will have to pay electricity the following month even if bitcoin goes to 0.
Next, we have to think, who the hell would short bitcoin? banks? traders? They want to ride the money bull as much as we want, why short bitcoin if you can have an almost guaranteed profit by the end of the month?"
The professionals believe that Bitcoin is a bubble, and it has no tangible value whatsoever. They will look at futures as a way of profiting from the situation. Period.
"Another thing we have to remember is that CME actually has some kind of stop loss on their future market, they said that if the market swings more than 7% up or down in a day they will just shut down the operations for that day. These people are not wall street, who want to make money out of derivatives on top of derivatives, history has shown that CME plays on the farmer side, or the miner side on btc spectrum."
Crap, they only do this to protect themselves from a run. They are primarily a source of speculation. Do some research and you'll find that for most commodities traded the amount traded can be hundreds of time the amount of commodities that actually exist.
Regardless, of the huge amount of  speculative trading that goes on, the price discovery process still assists those that produce or consume the product. In short it removes 'some' price volatility.

They may well short it to protect the holdings value and to reduce volatility, let me explain.
Say you hold 100million in Bitcoin, you short the equiv. of 25million
The effect is that you still make money when it goes up, but about 25% less, and you still lose money when it goes down, about 25% less.
Hence you have now decreased the volatility of your asset.

Bitcoin is backed by Blockchain. Blockchain has the value.
"the value of bitcoin. portable wealth+freedom. permissionless and limited."
Yes, I see that it can be used for illegal purposes, but I do not believe that this justifies the current price.
Besides the stealing of it by criminals, is just as likely as the use of it by criminals. Given this it's only a matter of time before the authorities outlaw it.

"Institutional money cannot buy or sell bitcoin." 
Ever heard of hedge funds, they can pretty much do as they wish....
I can't even bother to comment on the rest of the rant but to say.........
The price action over the last few weeks/months could have easily been caused by hedge funds buying.....
Because in June the announcement that futures may soon be available was made, i.e. the ability to short would soon be upon us.
So, lets say some smart buggers, and the buggers are pretty smart started to buy at that point, and kept accumulating until Friday...... They now have a large holding that can be sold (they have artificially pumped the price, and they know this). So they can be pretty confident that they can pull it back down again.
As from today they can short Bitcoin. So, they open there shorts and start to sell. Simply put they cannot lose.
This is just one way that this market can be manipulated, hence the futures market protection of 7% max swing in a day and 44% margin requirements.

At some stage there will be loads of sellers and few buyers.
Please don't come back and tell me it's a currency, because Steam have just walked away from accepting Bitcoin (read it, it makes for a harsh commentary on Bitcoin).

"Since its inception up to now, bitcoins is being viewed by the general public as a long term investment asset (through capital gains or trading) and their ultimate get rich plan."
The general public have barely touched it. You are confusing the general public with those on this forum....
"(1)So everyone is buying, holding, trading. Currency is not being circulated through purchasing good, service, etc. Rate fluctuates and the spread keeps on getting larger making the rate so inconsistent. This makes it hard for merchants to adopt bitcoin since they may lose money and not a lot of people use it for day to day transactions."
It does not work as a currency, period. Read Steam's explanation for ceasing acceptance of Bitcoin.
"(2) Volatility affetcs public trust. Would a person buy a coffee when the currency he used to buy it fluctuates real hard? He may be drinking a coffee much more expensive tomorrow."
Currencies must be stable, volatility is death to a currency.
"Any thoughts on the future use of bitcoin?"
I assume that the criminal fraternity will continue to use it to trade under the counter and use it to transfer gains around the world. But IMHO this use alone will not sustain the current price. And ultimately this use will bring about it's demise.

To go short, you buy a futures contract to sell at the current price in the future.

Clearly there are risks, it could go against you, or it may not move.

A stop loss order will not work as you might expect, or hope, on an asset that is as volatile as a bitcoin.
Simply put. if it is trading at 10,000 and you put a stop loss at 9,500, a gap down to 9,000 will sell at 9,000.....not at 9,500.
If there was a flash crash to 6,000, your stop loss will trigger and sell at 6,000.
Do not assume that your order will get priority over all of the other orders attempting to get filled.
Even on a slow moving FTSE100 share, bad news overnight can cause a drop (gap down) well below any stop loss, and sell at a price you may not wish to have sold at.
So, stop losses are a complete waste of time, even more so on a volatile asset like Bitcoin.

More liquidity = less volatility .....NORMALLY.....
Which is why futures were created in the first place. To allow farmers to secure a fixed price for their crops, and allow food producers to secure a fixed price for their supplies. Which ensures a relatively stable price in the shops for food (and other goods).
Effectively, you are buying insurance that if the price of the underlying asset changes you will be protected from that change (you pay a premium for this, which given recent volatility could initially be quite high).
Thats for the users of futures, but most buyers are speculators and the derivatives often (read always) massively multiply the actual amount of the commodity in existence.
So, for bitcoin the virtual currency which is apparently limited to under 21 million coins. with futures contracts 21 billion 'virtual' virtual bitcoins could exist.
In short, you will not have to buy actual bitcoins to speculate on the rise or fall of bitcoins.
This fact could cause 'issues', some of which have been brought up by in the following article, warning the CME to keep bitcoin futures financially separated from other CME business. They appear concerned that a massive fluctuation could bring down the CME.

Both were/are asset bubbles.
In short the 'only' real value is what you can sell it for. Google 'greater fool theory' (GFT).
There are of course other asset bubbles, like property. BUT, you can live in property, you can rent property, IT EXISTS. It is highly unlikely under any circumstances (bar global thermonuclear war, I suppose) that property will go to ZERO.
The same cannot be said for a 'virtual' asset.

It is of little or no use as a currency.

Correct, but this is the problem with bitcoin, once the transaction has been accepted, it cannot be reversed. PERIOD.
The BLOCKCHAIN cannot be modified, that is it's strength and it's weakness.
It's not perfect, far from it.
Much like the Brinks Matt gold, it will be 'melted down, mixed with crap', and sold back to be refined and recirculated.
Must be galling to know that your money just sits there and the system as it is cannot touch it.

Before you trust anything that McAfee says, take a look at his background.
McAfee's sold his company in the 1990s for roughly $100million.
After making the sale he quickly spent his fortune on nine luxurious homes, multiple planes, vintage cars, expensive art and other oddities - such as a dinosaur skull. 
But in 2009 he allegedly lost most of his money in the financial crisis. McAfee denies going broke, but nonetheless liquidated his assets and moved to Belize.
Without getting into the shenanigans in Belize, and his 'escape' from Belize authorities..... google it.

People will weigh up the risks and allocate assets appropriately.

Capital gain.......
As for holding out, all you do is put off a massive tax bill. Better to take some of the gain each tax year as most countries give you an annual capital gains tax(CGT) free amount.
In the UK it's over £11,000 per annum (for each individual). You have to use it each year (OR LOSE IT).
You can always sell it, realise the gain, and then buy back in.
Take the advice of an accountant if you think you may be liable for CGT

It is a DERIVITIVE, it derives value from the underlying asset, i.e. Bitcoin.
You will be able to go long or short, and you will have to pay a premium, which could be significant given the current volatility.
In short it allows access to Bitcoin without buying any.
My best guess is that futures should ease the volatility in the underlying asset. It was what they were designed for!
BUT, it may encourage significant shorting, given that shorting is not something that is currently available to speculators.

If they short Bitcoin that means that they are going to buy a futures contract to sell bitcoin at the current rice in the future.
They pay a premium and then wait. 
A contract then exists, this contract can be bought and sold. It is either in the money (profitable) or out of the money (loss making).
If bitcoin continues to go up, they will eventually have to pay the difference in the price.
If it goes down they will gain the difference in the price.
They do not have to buy the underlying asset, they are cash settled contracts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:16:53
The average joe will not be able to trade bitcoin futures.
AFAIK 'the deal is' you have to contract a minimum of 10 bitcoin and they require a margin of 35% (given recent volatility this may increase).
So, given a Bitcoin price of $15,000 = $150,000 for 10, 35% of that is well over $50,000.
So, I think that this contracts caper is strictly for the professionals.
One point, an important one, given the recent volatility since the announcement this launch could get shelved or delayed. (My personal opinion, that said, earlier today the FT (UK) mentioned this)
Watch this space.

The reason the wealth gap has expanded is the low inflation rate since the banking crisis.
Simply put the value of savings has not been eroded by inflation. So low inflation is good for the rich.
However with higher inflation wealth gets eroded, debt also gets eroded (good for those with debt). So those with debt and working are better off, as generally speaking wages will rise with pressure from inflation (not always).
Simply put it is in the interest of workers with debt to have 'reasonable' levels of inflation, hence the government target of circa 3%.
The suggestion is that Bitcoin could be deflationary, like this is a good thing, it is not. Ask the Japanese what having a deflationary currency is like.
A deflationary spiral is when a period of decreasing prices (deflation) leads to a situation whereby the economy cannot recover, which compounds over time leading to even lower prices in a vicious cycle.
A small amount of inflation is a good thing........

Given the fixed amount of bitcoin on the market, a loan with interest would not be possible.
Given this no interest could be paid on bitcoin deposits either.
Loans create inflation, how would you pay back the principal+interest with the 'currency' restrictions regards inflation?

Bubble bursting, Bitcoin rally has run out of 'greater fools'...........
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:46:24
In one, the guy has got it............
The reason for the meteoric rise in bitcoin is this......
1. there is a limited amount of it.
2. everyone is hoarding it.
As long as there are greater fools that keep buying it Bitcoin could go on forever........and ever.......and ever.
When you buy someone else has to sell, there is a finite amount don't forget.
So, do you know more than the seller does, that is the question. Are you more expert on the seller, do you have better information than the seller?
Simply put......
Are you the greater fool or are they?
That's the question you have to answer.

The half of the world that does not have a bank account does not need a bank account......so, it's a crap point.
Gold is a store of wealth, gold coins exist but no longer used as currency, but, they could be!
I wonder when Amazon will accept Krugerrand's in exchange for goods, probably long before they'll accept Bitcoin.
Why would they want to freeze everyones bank account? Regardless, I could imagine plenty of circumstances where they may want to freeze Bitcoin traffic and ban the trade in bitcoin for US citizens. They once banned the holding of Gold by US citizens.
No government will EVER give up the ability to control the supply of money.

A gap down is when it jumps down not allowing a stop loss to work....as you might imagine it to.
Simply put, lets say the price is 10,000 and your stop loss is 9,500. The price could gap down to 7,000 and that would be the price at which your stop loss activates. That is a gap down.
Do not assume that a stop loss order will work  as you might expect it to.
Which is why when spread betting you can pay a premium for a guaranteed stop loss.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:56:23
A gap down, or up is something that can happen as a result of sudden news, or at the start of the trading day, I know of no other definition.

The rise was down to speculation, the speculators now appear to have moved over to Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:20:54
Currencies exist to facilitate trade, acceptance is key to this.
Bitcoin acceptance is a joke, and those suggesting that it's only been a few years give it time is also a joke. The Euro gained immediate acceptance as a currency.
Bitcoin is currently a store of wealth, a store that has been subject to speculative investments. It is now a bubble, personally I will not touch bubbles.
As a currency the Dollar is much better, as a store of wealth Gold is much better. As an investment, Property and the Stock Market is much better.
Bitcoin is no better than putting money into tulip bulbs.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:08:52
The S&amp;P500 has risen 18% in 12 months. Please do not try and compare the performance of 500 US companies with Bitcoin's 863% rise in 12 months.

Bitcoin has existed for a few years, and it has still not been accepted for the purchase of goods by virtually every company in existence.
Personally I don't think it ever will.
1. it has proved to be very volatile
2. it does not have government support.
...and most importantly.
3. it is now the subject of speculation, great as long as the music keeps playing, but not much use as a currency.

Bitcoin is a classic bubble, question why is it going up so quickly?
1. it's not because use of the currency has increased substantially in the last few months.
2. it is not because large companies have started to accept bitcoin.
So why?
Simply put it is going up for one reason speculation, I buy it because I want to sell it at a higher price, period.
A Classic bubble is being created, every day greater and greater fools are buying, eventually you run out of fools and the sell off will begin.
It's just a matter of when the music stops.

The Quick Answer
What is the difference between loose and lose?
Loose means not tight or free from constraint (e.g., These trousers are loose.)
To lose means:
To fail to keep (e.g., I will lose weight but also my hair.)
To fail to win (e.g., I'm expected to lose this match.)
To fail to make money (e.g., I will lose a fortune.)

@_date: 2017-11-09 12:22:18
To elucidate on my point....
Banks have a license to 'create' money based on your promise to pay the principle back + interest. This is how most money is created.
Given the way Bitcoin works, they could not create money and therefore no loans.
You do realise that loans and deposits are not 1:1 linked. A deposit of lets say $1,000 dollars allows the bank to CREATE $10,000 dollars in loans. These figures are estimates I am not aware of the current rate, it is likely to be much lower than 10% as stated in this example.
Why do you think that loans going bad can cause a run on the bank........simple, THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY.....
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:23:42

In short, cementing its place as a commodity......
It's never going to be a currency, some other coin may achieve that status.
It's pretty obvious that transaction fees and transaction times make that very unlikely for bitcoin.
I'd assume that at some stage one of the central banks will launch their own digital blockchain based currency. One that the governments will back and large retailers like Amazon will accept.

Some information..... When something is getting pumped daily by the media, it has already hit mainstream. It has likely as not topped out at circa $8,000.
You are now in the final stages of the PUMP.......
This is around the time that the smart money starts to DUMP, all the while telling you to hold on and everything will be fine.
You only have to look at the curve over the last 2 months.
Question, why is it going up, is it just because you buy thinking you can sell it later to a greater fool. Then that is the art of speculation.
Not value, Speculation.
Sure, I'd pay 100,000 for a bitcoin if I thought I could sell it for 101,000. That said I do not have 'faith' that enough greater fools exist to keep this going for much longer.
Faith is not something I base my investments on.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:50:45
Simply put, why is one bitcoin worth $8,000, easy because a greater fool is prepared to buy it for $8,001. Eventually you run out of greater fools. At what price this will happen is anyones guess, but the music will eventually stop.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:32:05
A stop loss will not protect you if the market gaps down. And if you don't know what a gap down is then you should not be recommending a stop loss.

Yes, it will increase the price, but that is not why the price is increasing. Also that would not increase the price as quickly as speculation will.
Simply put, what we have here is a speculative bubble, people are buying in the hope of selling for more later, period. They are not buying to use it as a currency.
It's the 'greater fool' mentality.
How much is a tin of soup worth...
First assume that there is just one tin of soup and that they cannot make any more.
So, how much is it worth?
I pay $50 for it, am I a fool?
No, because I sell it for $100 to a greater fool.
Problem is, eventually you run out of greater fools. The bubble then ends.

-the reason why the generation of BTC is called mining because the creation of BTC is heavily modelled after the generation of gold i.e. the more gold extracted, the harder to extract future gold therefore, more investment needed to extract future gold.
So you are suggesting that gold is harder to mine than it was years ago?
Bovine scat......... Mining is far more efficient today than it has ever been.
-greater market adoption with over 100,000 reatilers globally now accepting bitcoin
Amazing, but still not accepted by the largest internet retailers, why?
-compared to our fiat currency, it costs next to nothing to print hundreds of bank notes but it costs hundreds if not thousands to create bitcoins through mining.
...and that is relevant because?
-as we have seen last week, BTC is far less prone to market rigging than Fiat currencies by the fact that within a week it managed to sustain a price rigging attack and stabilised. whenever this happens on the FOREX markets, recovery can take weeks if not months.
Please do show an example where a currency traded on the world markets fell by 30+% in one day?
Or for that matter one that rose by 2,700+% in three years.
It's a bubble, period. A first class greater fool theory bubble, no question.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:19:06
It's a bad thing if you like volatility....
Allowing people to buy or sell in the future at an agreed price (plus commission) should create some stability.
Also there is no need to buy bitcoin to get in on the action, they can create 1,000s of times more 'derivative' bitcoins than currently exist.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:18:20
Why are you worried, you should not be buying bitcoin with money that you cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:40:05
Allowing derivatives of bitcoin effectively allows you to buy it without actually buying it. I suspect that this will probably add some stability to the price.
Think about it, for every one million bitcoins there could be hundreds of millions of derivative bitcoins.
Given that bitcoins are virtual anyway, it could prove to be an interesting few weeks.

"Bitcoin would not allow Banks to do this type of banking anymore."
Fab, but how would you ever get any credit? How would you ever buy a car, never mind buy a house?
So, YES banks could create there own virtual currency, HINT they do it's known as, money created as debt.
Most money is created as debt, it is created based on your signature that you will pay it all back with interest (large amounts generally secured on assets, like your home).
No debt no money....... Why do you think that the government saved the banking system?
Why do you think that the government gave the banks money and encouraged, nay virtually insisted that they lend it.
This is why bitcoin will not replace FIAT currency. Do not kid yourself that it could ever replace FIAT currency.

Issue with bitcoin is that it is not backed by anything. It has no tangible value whatsoever.
At least with fiat currency you have the government enforced right to use it to pay off debt (no company can refuse to accept it for the payment of debt). So it has real value in that respect.
No one has to accept bitcoin, and very few companies do accept it.
So as a currency its not much use.
As a store of wealth Gold is better, and property better still (you can let it).
I understand that whilst this speculative bubble continues there is benefit (and considerable risk) in holding it. Why hold it once it is stable?

You'll never get interest with Bitcoin, you can't create it like banks create cash (for good or bad). Simply put, Banks use your promise to pay as a license to create the cash they loan you (out of thin air). They can't loan bitcoin, so can't pay interest on it.

The Bitcoin price was clearly the victim of mass hysteria when all of the media (not just the financial media, important point) were pumping it last November. 
Lots of punters were sucked in and got burned, the 'hodlers' kept holding in the belief that it would continue to rise (pretty foolish). It was quite clear that it would not, and the smart money was happily filling orders at stratospheric levels.
The whole process relied upon greater fools, and after the massive pump and dump that occurred during the pre and post Xmas period last year those  greater fools took a bath. They will not be coming back, and the only publicity you have now is a multi-billion dollar (or sterling/euro if you prefer) crash in bitcoin prices.
For the price to rise again you need buyers, not holders, remember more coins are being mined everyday (inflation), you need buyers and plenty of them.
The only investment worth holding now is a short. Which is why the pros started allowing shorts in Bitcoin last December (COINCIDENCE, really?).
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:05:58
The Bitcoin whales can walk this price up and down all day................ which is what happens given the lack of regulation and huge amounts in the hands of very few individuals.
Simple.......... pump it up, draw in the fools money, fill those orders, then take it down forcing those same fools to panic sell, rinse and repeat for as long as you can get away with it.

@_date: 2018-11-25 17:39:53
Will Bitcoin go higher?
Why did it go to 20k, well a lot of good publicity, which pulled in a lot of new punters. Which given the restricted amount of coin drove the price up exponentially.
Will this happen again?
I think that this is unlikely, one might understand punters chasing the price up when all around are cheering it on upwards including the mass media. But, I do not see that happening again, fool me once and all that. Also, the price has pretty much been falling ever since. So the story now is a very different one.
So why aren't people piling in at the current price, well that would be the typical reaction to a significant fall, but those that bought in were not typical investors.
I guess what I'm trying to say is where is the value? there is no underlying asset, there is no income. You'd only buy if you can later sell it to a greater fool, confidence of doing this has taken a huge knock.
Share and other asset prices fluctuate, and sometimes crash, but generally speaking there is an underlying value. With companies there is plant, property and of course earnings. What is there with Bitcoin?
IMHO, nothing, it is purely a speculative item that only makes you a profit by selling it at a higher price to a greater fool. so you are reliant on a steady supply of greater fools buying the item. No more fools no more profit.

It has no value to a buyer unless they can sell it for more.
Once you become a holder it has the current market value.
But, why buy an 'asset' that is falling in value, and has no underlying asset. OK, it's supposed to be a currency, currency has value. But, currency only has value when it is widely accepted and above all stable. Neither of which apply to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is totally reliant on greater fools to give it value.

��Mark Mobius  Getty Images**By** **Chris Newlands**May 21, 2018 Updated: May 22, 2018 7:07 a.m. GMT
Some of the biggest names in finance have lambasted the bitcoin market and poured scorn on the meteoric rise of the digital currency, calling it one of the "greatest scams" in financial history.
Renowned fund managers including investment guru Mark Mobius and Davide Serra, the founder of UK hedge fund Algebris Investments, have likened the bitcoin market to a 'Ponzi scheme' used to propagate criminal activity.
Mobius, the 81-year-old asset manager, added: "I think bitcoin is a real fraud, I really do. The first thing I do is ask people 'can you explain it to me? Who is running it? Who is controlling it?' And nobody can. Whenever anybody asks me about bitcoin, I say 'sorry, I don’t like to talk about religion in public'."

Buyers are just handing over good money for something that has no value, unless they can sell it to another punter for more.

Holding is not going to stop the price dropping, you need to buy. Without buyers the price will continue to drop. 
Also more new coins are added every day from mining, these also have to be bought else the price will continue to fall.
In short bitcoins are being printed by miners, this is devaluing the currency. Much akin to when the treasury prints dollars, only they do it when the currency is strong and avoid doing it when the currency is weak.
Miners don't give a toss, they just keep mining the price down.

Yes, I have read the white paper and the transaction processing system of blockchain will be very successful, no doubt. Many major banks are already investing in blockchain technology.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:42:51
Ironically it is the massive increase in value over the last few months that convinces me that this could never be a useful currency. I suspect that it will go from boom to bust on a regular basis until it is regulated and adopted by the majority of financial institutions. 
That said, I am convinced that Blockchain technology will become the primary method for small financial transactions in the near future.
But I suspect the currency in use on those systems will be digital Dollars, Sterling, Euro, etc......
my 10cents.

If anything the recent bubble in the price is not an improvement in the chance of BTC ever becoming a currency, far from it. The volatility will prevent it from becoming a currency.

I did not rediscover anything. Grisham's law does not apply, BTC is just another 'form' of FIAT currency (it is not gold or silver backed), it has no intrinsic value and further more it cannot be used to repay debt.
It is purely a speculative THING, much like tulips were. So what is BTC worth......
It's worth what you can sell it for.....?
Just pray that there continues to be more buyers than sellers.

Understanding the maths, is not essential. 
Likely as not once you understand the math, you'll probably want to do something else with your time.  ;-)

Granted the blockchain platform is useful and will be monetised, quite a few banks are investing in the use of blockchain for transactions.
But to suggest that that makes a blind bit of difference to BTC is garbage.
Thats like suggesting that plain white cotton is worth the same as printed dollars.
Whilst the transaction system is useful, BTC has little use other than as a speculative pyramid scheme.

What is the point of a currency that has been in existence for EIGHT years and is still not widely accepted?
Currencies exist to facilitate trade, period.

They would not be allowed to refund you less than you paid. THIS IS THE ISSUE. BTC is way too volatile to be used for trade. 
Of course with illegal trade they do not care about the huge moves, they do not give refunds.... ;-)

Market value is what someone will pay for it.......
If I was in the desert the market value of water could be thousands of dollars per cup.
so what is BTC worth........it is worth what you can sell it for, no more no less.

"Check out Purse.io sometime if you think we aren't shopping at Amazon all the time with BTC."
You are just converting BTC to a currency that Amazon accepts. What would happen if you returned the goods, would you get the same amount of BTC back?
I'd guess not.

It has to be accepted for the repayment of debt (government mandated), period.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:25:57
Agree, but BTC is currently in the grip of a speculative bubble, I strongly suspect that it will bubble and burst many times over the next few years. This instability will effectively ruin the possibility of it becoming a widely used and accepted currency.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:52:23
What it the use if you can't spend it?
What is the use if you can't buy it?
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:23:31
No..... No more than dollars, the cost of manufacture is irrelevant.
What gives value is the price people are willing to pay for it, period.
Of course if people are not prepared to pay anything then it's value is 0 and it will not be produced (commerically).
If it is a currency then it's value is in it's acceptability for the payment of debt. So it is widely accepted for the payment of debt. 
Please don't use the it's a new currency mantra, SO IS THE EURO!
So, is it a currency or not, because it has no intrinsic value whatsoever, unlike Gold (which can be made into jewellery, and used in electronics, etc).
So it has no intrinsic value, and it is of little or no use as a currency, so what is it worth?
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:17:19
IMHO, given it's current volatility it could never be accepted by any company that give refunds. 
Accepted for services perhaps, but not for non-perishable goods that could be returned.
Refunds are the real issue for such a volatile pseudo-currency.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:57:06
My point exactly, the retailer would get shafted for .001 BTC. This volatility has a huge impact on the ability to accept BTC in trade for goods.
Lets not forget what BTC is for, is it for speculating on, or does it exist to support trade?
i.e. is it really a currency?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:53:55
The point of STORE is that it should not be too volatile, it should be relatively safe.
Bitcoin is neither safe or stable.
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:00:19
WTF has 'new' got to do with it. The Euro was introduced 'not that long ago' and was accepted by everyone immediately. 
Please do not use time as an excuse, it won't wash.

Effort does not equal value. I could dig holes and fill them all day every day and not add one ounce of value.
Being well known does not have value, everyone knows Charles Ponzi and Bernie Madoff. Do they have value?
BTC has become well known because of it's rapid growth ;in value, not usage; over the last few months (the bubble created a news story). 
Traders are using the publicity to sell more BTC, pushing the price even higher. Classically known as a pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:30:06
People are buying because they think they can sell it later for more than they pay for it.....Speculation creating a bubble.
Greed, pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:19:32
What about refunds?
Not possible with such a volatile pseudo-currency.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:33:05
Whether it did or did not is not the point. 
What is the point is that the growth in value over a few months can only be down to speculation. Much like the growth in value that occurred during the dot.com boom, or in every other boom/bust cycle.
Simply put the lack of BTC available countered with those that want to buy it is causing a huge bubble in the price. The more it rises the more people may want to buy it.
But it will burst, it's just a matter of when, not if.
