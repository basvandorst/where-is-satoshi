Sure, if you say so

So you don't believe the reports that there is a trend of more Mexican migrants leaving the US than entering? Is that "fake news"?

Where did I imply that "everything is racist and white people suck"?
Jesus. If your thoughts went straight to that then maybe you've got some self-reflection to do buddy

The internet is a big place, and so is *Mainstream Media*. Could you be specific?

Where are you getting your news sources from?

Exactly. If you're advocating for the wall to be built (paid by your tax dollars), then you have to believe that it will do something beneficial. In this case, to keep immigrants from Mexico from entering illegally - but the wall is a YUGE waste of tax payers money since recent reports say that they are leaving the US more than entering.
Spoiler: Even if that's not true, you could enter the US by plane and overstay your VISA. That's how my German ex stayed illegally in Australia for a couple years. Nobody calls a white guy an immigrant though, funny that.

What are your thoughts on illegal immigrants from Mexico? And the wall?

I like his sentiment on not being involved in the Middle East anymore. When do you think Trump will follow through with that sentiment?
