Start small with just a few coins and watch it grow. Then show her gyft buy her a gift card with the profit. Then cash out so she sees you profited.

Awe shucks *blushing*

I love it.

Looks like they have now liked the beta site prices to real time MtGox prices. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:17:38
That is awesome.

All I hear in my head is that Coke song "I'd like to buy the world a coke and teach them all to sing" or something like that. But instead of Coke replace it with Bitcoin :)

Awe, even though the academy doesn't like it when you go full retard doesn't mean it's not fun to watch! 
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:22:10
Sounds awesome, I'm happy you have someone to share it with. As for the tag team comment...all I could hear in my head were thousands of male voices saying "that's what she said"! Lol. But yes, it would be easier if it weren't just me. Any thoughts on how we can help get the word out? 
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:44:05
It's funny that you mentioned Zappos, I emailed them last night and asked them to start accepting bitcoin. I also emailed Old Navy. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:03:06
I really wish we knew why this is happening so frequently.

I envy you. I've been trying to get pregnant for five Years. I'm hoping to make enough investing in bitcoin to afford IVF. It can cost up to $14,000 and they say it doesn't always work the first time. So I'm buying up what I can now hoping in a few years it might pay off. Good luck to you and your wife, a baby is a real blessing.

Shun, shun the non-believer!!!
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:53:48
I'd be happy to just get one but I'd be over the moon if I got multiples! Trust me when you go so long thinking you'll never even have one child the prospect of getting twins or triplets sounds wonderful. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:36:12
I love it. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:01:17
It also seems they are basing your price on how many coins you want to buy or sell which doesn't seem right. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 03:32:30
I'm into bitcoin. I got interested after I heard about it on lifehacker. I like being an early adopter and it's fun to watch all that is happening. It's exciting. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 00:59:06
Happy Cake Day! 
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:18:03
I'll be interested to see if their sell orders don't get cancelled. You know they are all holding their breath until they see the money in their account. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:17:53
Depends on your end game. Are you in it for the long haul? Are you going to spend your coins? Are you just looking for short term profit? 
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:13:27
I know how you feel about the way people look at you, I work in IT and no one I work with has a clue about bitcoins. That doesn't stop me from trying to explain it though! 
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:39:36
Nice, I like this interpretation. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:30:02
I was wondering what the percentage of men vs women was around the BTC community. I was thinking of doing a YouTube video about my bitcoin experience thus far to see if it would help garner interest from more women like me. Face it, women are more chatty and it might help spread the word faster. I just need to get over my camera shyness. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:01:24
I won't tell you what I wish I could have done when I heard it...she said it straight to my face. I think my MIL is Satan. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 23:06:50
It looks like money in my pocket, not egg on my face. Lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:26
Your life is worth more than any money you may or may not have lost (remember this is not over) but even if you do lose your tuition money, is it really something you'd consider ending your life over? I understand how it may seem like there is no light at the end of the tunnel but even if you decide your life is worth nothing to you then why not invest your life in the universe and use it to help other people, spend time volunteering, and living simply. Money is just a means to get material things, there is so much more to life than that. Just think about it. Even though it feels like you're never going to look back at this and laugh, trust me no matter the outcome, you will make it through this to the other side. And I promise you will be glad you didn't throw it all away over money. Hang in there.

I can't help but feel it's going to be huge. (That's what she said!)
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:27:01
Just like they always honor the buy requests? I hope they do but more importantly I hope they come out and tell us what happened. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:15:21
Gambling is an addiction and can be very appealing due to the premise that you're getting something for nothing. But that's why they call it gambling because every time you bet you bet on the hope you will win but the other side of that is that you could just as easily lose. In fact that's why casinos are so successful, they usually come out on top.  It's really a numbers game and only a matter of time until you lose so take the money and run while you can and count yourself lucky. Then only indulge with small amounts knowing you may lose that amount and just be ok with losing if that's what's in the cards for you. (Sorry for all the stupid puns), hope this helps.

Most likely ddos attack at this point lag time is ranging from 50 seconds to over a minute. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:00:17
Functional enough so you can work with the money they start your account with and watch it grow with each trade you make. It's actually kind of fun. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:48:33
What good is having money if you don't help out your friends and family?

Can I borrow your crystal ball? 
@_date: 2013-05-08 00:18:01
I like that its more than just bitcoin, you can also trade Ripples. You can try it for yourself if you wish.

Knock knock...who's there...Bitcoin...Bitcoin who...Bitcoin and now my tooth is broken.  Ha ha :) 42

I think it's more that he wouldn't want to do that to our child. Wouldn't want him/her to feel like they were anything less than our own child. We live in a place where we're surrounded by family and for the most part that's good but it also makes it almost impossible to cut them out of our lives. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:02:09
Thank you, I appreciate that. We have toastmasters where I work that I am going to join. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:12:43
You'd better get Jesse Ventura to investigate. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:10:39
Yes, but don't make the same mistake I did and click on the girls gone bitcoin link thinking that's the link for the women who follow bitcoin. It is not! So not what I thought it was at all! Lol. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:44:58
It seems to have been short lived :( 
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:25:00
I have and it would be just as good for me however my husband's family has said if we adopted that child would not be their grandchild and they wouldn't treat them the same...which I could care less about but they got into his head. It's sad really because there are so many children who could use a loving home. I figure if they want grandchildren bad enough (he's an only child) that at some point they may come around. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:37:41
I figured it must have been something like that. I wasn't worried. Thanks for the update. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:30:44
Interesting idea ;)
@_date: 2013-10-10 01:41:38
I would. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:36:01
Never put all of your eggs in one basket. Diversify. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:54:56
I'm sorry that you didn't get the response you deserved. You should be proud of yourself. Don't let them take that away from you. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:03:19
Sounds like you did a good job. If she's really interested there is more than enough information out there for her to read. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:04:02
You're a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:52:37
That's because women don't need to pay men to take off their clothes. I've found all you really have to do is ask. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:34:45
I agree, by gaining momentum I meant holding at 150 with smaller jumps and less flux throughout the day. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:48:09
I like it! 
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:24:41
Yes, I can put in orders (fake of course) and trade. It works great. I will say on my work computer I couldn't see anything, but on my home computer and phone I can. I figured it was my settings. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:29:23
It's more than selling. Lag time is increasing. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 15:52:59
I noticed it too. Not sure what's up. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:26:25
Sorry about high pitched sound. I really didn't hear it until the video uploaded. If I do another video I will make sure it doesn't sound like there's a bomb about to go off in my kitchen. Thanks for the encouragement. I really only want to help further the community and the technology. Also just so you know, I was very nervous in this video. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:51:31
Neither really. I don't feed trolls :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:33:55
Yes, it's been "paused" all day. Not sure what that means though. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 04:40:51
I'd cash out and use the money for IVF.
