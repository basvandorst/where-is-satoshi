My girlfriend sprained her ankle in the snow here in the UK last winter. We were fairly certain it was just a sprain; but why not get it checked?
Quick trip to the Dr, ~45 minute wait, x-ray, turns out to just be a sprain, given crutches ("please bring these back when you're done"), general advice and sent on our way in less than an hour.
Of course, private health care is also available for those who want to pay for it, but we have no need.

The [link]( the other guy posted (refuting his own 90%.. is actually 50%) shows UK per capita public expenditure around $2,500 / year, with US per capita public expenditure around $4,000 / year.
When you include private spending the US is ~$8,200, and the UK around $3,300/person/year. 
As a percentage GDP, UK public spending is very slightly higher (about 8% in both cases), but when you include private spending is ~9.6% UK to 17.6% US.

I don't believe the 90%, but public spending on healthcare per capita in the UK is less than public spending on healthcare per capita in the US.

Speak for yourself mate, I get 3% on my basic checking account.

Is that possible because bitcoin is still relatively small?

So it's basically a risk-free money printing machine? Got it.

Free and instant transfers between bank accounts too.

If it's sure things why hasn't the market corrected the price? You shouldn't be able to beat the market right?

There is a £5 monthly fee. There is also 1-3% cashback on various household bills.

Also with PAYM you can send money to mobile numbers rather than bank accounts. You have to register first of course.

In the UK bank transfers are instant. Looks good to me.

Banking in the UK is pretty good; NFC cards and pay points are common, most bank transfers happen instantly, you can send money to peoples phone numbers.
