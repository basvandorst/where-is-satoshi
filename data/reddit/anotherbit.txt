I do not think that China will so easily left from blokchain industry. This country is one of the major who orientated to new technology and are the strongest in electronic payment systems.  
They just do trading very well. This news is a part of China trading strategy.

France derives over 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy. Belgium 50%,Sweden 40%, Korea 30%, UK and USA 20%.
There is still dangerous of using nuclear power and if humanity will find a solution for excisting problems(waste utilisation) it would be the bigest gain. Not only financialy, but also ecologicly. There are some dark episodes like Ukrainian Chernobyl and Japan Fukushima but in general it should not be the reason to stop researchs and development. Coil and Gas station is much more ecologicaly dangerous ,because the waste from them is constant, cummulative and unreturnable either.

Nope Solar Plants will not work good. You need to fight heat from ASIC chips so they could be effective. Thats why major mining farms is in a cold regions (Iceland) or in high mountains (North China, Georgias Mountains (not US state but exUSSR country)  
Leningrad area in Russia is a north region (near Finland) with new Nuclear Station in 2018 - is a really good candidate for mining farms. Nuclear Station is 100% eco friendly and super cheap in cost.
