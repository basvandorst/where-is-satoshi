yellow/orange line on the left - bid (buy) orders
blue line on the right - ask (sell) orders
green line in the middle - price of last order
Current price around ~$24.80 
bottom X axis - USD price
left Y axis - sum of all BTC bids, correspond a point of the orange line between the X and Y axis to see how much BTC it'd take to move the price to a certain $ value. For example, in my imgur link, it'd take a little less than 5000BTC to be sold down (at this moment) in order to hit $24.00.
right Y axis - sum of all BTC asks, correspond a point of the blue line between the X and Y axis to see how much USD it'd take to move the price to a certain $ value. For example, in my imgur link, it'd take around $160,000 to be spent on buying BTC upwards (at this moment) in order to get a little above $26.00.

I'd love to use it, but the PayPal option is cheaper. The PayPal option is also broken, and confuses the user's e-mail with the seller's e-mail so one can't sign in.
