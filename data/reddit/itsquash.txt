I don't see cnbs reporting this. They only report bad news to create fud

It's normal for crypto to drop 30% a day or gain 30% in a day. I have two positions, one hodl and one day for day trading

They wanted to see how much influence they had on the market

Why??? Do i need to be stopped by Rice? And besides, people hate on people based on their age and voice which cannot be determined oneself.  Shouldn't we be supportive of people sharing their ideas and opnions of about Blockchain instead of hating on people? 
Anyways, 100% lowkey will drop fire disstrack on you tmr.

I mean why does the only the bad stuff about Bitcoin gets reported by the news. Well ratings. But Bitcoin is used legally by many dedicated people that believe that no one bank should control half the market.

Use a hardware wallet such as Ledger, it's more secure than a standard desktop wallet, hence it requires a physical button click before the transaction is confirmed. And also, the private keys are stored directly on the device and never leaves it. So in case your gets hacked, the hackers would not be able to access your coins.

That's what Coinbase does, but if you want buy at exact prices use Gdax which is also managed by Coinbase.

Aye thanks

You should really cover vertcoin which was created in 2014. It's a true to cryptos original values, prevents asic miners which in turn allows everyone to mine the coin and not just a couple big companies or asic makers. 
Also, it's one of the first coins to adopt new features such as segwit, and its working on lighting network and atomic swap. The devs are actively making the coin better and the community is large and supportive.

I didn't expect the market to drop even further. In the video, I stated that I was just giving my opinion and I did. I didn't want to give something that I didn't believe in. And of course, I was wrong. I guess we all make mistakes in life, especially in markets that are this volatile.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:27:23
Who knows man, this market changes rapidly. I guess what I would do is if you truly believe in blockchain tech you should invest in it. But you just want it for the price, thats a different story.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:29:05
Thanks, man! It's just that I have so much more to learn about markets.

Thank you so much for the support :)

No, I want to spread insightful information for those who are concerned about the correct. Instead of jumping to conclusions so easily, why don't you try to understand the situation first? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:12:45
Because we went from 900 to 20k to now 8k for those of us who believed in Bitcoin before it got main stream and hyped up still have huge gains from it. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:48:47
And your opinion matters why
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:57:13
But that was yesterday lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:52:43
I like Bitcoin and the idea of decentalization I'm nore if a long term holder. It's like before we experienced huge dips and I was fine
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:52:48

I know, I never stated that I was professional and all. I just want people to take my seriously and only judge my opinion because of my age. Like I wrote an essay in English class, and the teacher let you choose a topic, and the teacher just plain out roasted Bitcoin, saying, "Out of everything in the world, why are you interested in Bitcoin?"
So I fired back at him and explained why blockchain was the innovation. And yes, I admit I don't know much about stocks or investing markets, just I think I have a good understanding the fundamentals of Bitcoin and crypto. So I guess, I should try harder. BUt that's for the advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:52:40
Well all the TA suggested Bitcoin will rebouce around the 8k level but, crypto isn't like the stock market where these indicators work, because it's new and changes so rapidly. And also so much news is around so that creates alot of fud. For me I think I will invest if you believe in the tech and believe it will go main stream years from now 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:05
Can't really blame Bitcoin for that. It's those people that runs huge asic farms that drive difficultly up
