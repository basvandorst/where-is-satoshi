@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:26
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:46:50
it will take you ages to profit with 20 because of fees and the fact its such a small amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:04:37
tbh im just looking to sell before another dip takes place so i dont lose out.

Don't regret it because at the time you thought it was a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:22:14

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:19
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:59:16

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:01:18
