Armory is a really great bitcoin wallet.
I think it's the only one that allow you to create 2-of-3 paper wallet (or even n-of-p). And even if you receive coins after printing your wallet their are still saved because Armory compute a long list of addresses in advance.
And you can use it offline. You don't need to download all the blockchain. You can even create a transaction offline, save it on a USB key and then broadcast it on the network using a connected computer.
There is really a lot of great features, you should definitely take a look.

$140k for 770BTC = 181$/BTC  
Maybe that's why you are zen. It's a lot harder when you have bought your coins at $600+ (on average)

"Last Month" graph doesn't work for me (I get the same graph as "Last Day).

Is bitcoin still the most secure cryptocoin (ie all altcoins security is flawed)? Or maybe the proposals you make are already implemented (or irrelevant by design) in other coins?
I'm not asking about theoretical white paper security (I'm not asking if proof-of-stake is better than proof-of-work). I'm asking if their is *currently* any other coin that have better security and incentive mechanisms than bitcoin.
