Exactly, in addition, many users will want to use BitcoinOS completely offline, and in Linux it is usually hard to install software offline.

BitcoinOS can be used on an air-gapped system (using Armory or Electrum), but we don't yet have proper documentation... The Bitkey people seem very security-conscious and we hope to work with them to improve both distros. sx/libbitcoin will be packaged and available for easy install, probably even installed by default.
Regarding Ubuntu, is was not an easy choice, and we might use another distro in the future ([details here](
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:59:08
It will not work because the Raspberry Pi uses an ARM processor and BitcoinOS is x86 software. Having said that, we do want to have a lightweight version of BitcoinOS for the Raspberry Pi, possibly with Electrum and a minimal set of tools.

Thanks a lot, I've sent you a PM with details.
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:10:25
Yes, thanks for the suggestion, it is very robust and useful. It will be included by default in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-22 00:37:55
Yes, all the packages are included without modification and our build process uses pre-signed packages. For some apps like Electrum and Multibit we had to re-package them as .deb files, but the contents are 100% original. From the user-perspective this still does not rule out a back-door inserted by us on the base-system (Ubuntu), so "[reproducible builds]( (the same source-code always produces the same binary output) are our  priority

Correct (this assumes you use actual/proper encryption and not just the normal filesystem permissions)




Yes, malware running on one non-root account generally would not affect other account (unless it gets root using trickery or software vulns.).
The malware could also (while on the compromised account): See that you copied a BTC address into a text file and replace it with the attacker's address, this way the clean account would get an already "poisoned" address (This will be mostly fixed with the [Payment protocol/BIP70](

Bitcoin mining is not our top priority, as most users would have minimal interest/capability to do it. Having said that, we are open to that possibility. If you have experience with mining and want to help, feel free to PM me.

Yes, we want to be as close as possible to Ubuntu. We just removed a package related to the amazon link and another advertisement for a service that requires payment to use (Landscape). The [Dash ads]( were also completely disabled. (Every change will be properly documented before the final release)


Yes, runs pretty good from USB 2.0, very usable. Almost feels like running from an HDD, apps just take a little longer to load.

This will provide some security, for example against some malware running on the day-to-day user account, however, if you already have malware running as a normal user, that malware can launch key-loggers/screen-loggers directed at that account and (for example) easily launch a "fake" window saying there are updates and requesting the root password, thereby stealing it. The malware can also exploit a software flaw to automatically gain root access (this will be harder from the malware perspective if your system is up-to-date).
If the malware gains root/administrator powers, then it does not matter how well you lock-down the secondary account, as the malware will be able to ready every key pressed, read the contents of the RAM, etc...
I personally use a Live USB (bootable USB flash drive with an operating system there) with a Linux system used exclusively for Bitcoin transfers, its small and portable and does not require a secondary computer.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:23:51
We also plan to publish a few wallets/tools as "portable apps", so they can be used on most distros, this would also be available in script format that downloads the wallets from the respective websites, verifies hashes/signatures and automatically creates the app (this would be much easier to verify then a full disto).
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:56:57
Yes, we considered using Tails. In the end Ubuntu "won" mostly due to the support for "Secure Boot" (present in Windows 8 computers). This means that when we release the 64-bits version of BitcoinOS, it will hopefully run "out-of-the-box" on those systems. Having said that, it is always a possibility to change from Ubuntu to another Desktop Environment or distro, in particular possibly something like Debian, Tails or Fedora, possibly using a lighter interface like Xfce. (Either way, Tails is great and we hope to cooperate with them).
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:13:10
I actually agree 100% with you. One of the reasons we call it alpha is due to the lack of a proper/easy way to verify that no trickery exists (it just felt wrong to release such critical software as "stable" and just say "Hey, just trust us!", that is not really acceptable in the Bitcoin world). I think "[reproducible builds]( are the new "gold standard" in relation to security of software and will mostly solve this issue.

In practice "virtual" not only implies "not physical" but also "not real" and fake/simulated (virtual reality).
["very close to being something without actually being it" - Merriam Webster](
I'm not saying it is wrong, but it reinforces the idea that it is "fake money" as opposed to "real money" (government-issued money).

Not yet... I was trying to use an old laptop as a seeding machine but it was not working... I will try to rent a proper seedbox in the coming days and enable torrent downloads.
@_date: 2015-01-22 03:07:44
We are considering having the system boot by default in offline mode, and then let the user enable internet access (only if necessary)... but It is an excellent idea to have an option on the boot menu to select a "completely offline" mode... will certainly look into that. Do you have something specific in mind related to "super-secure clipboard manager"? do you mean something like encrypting the data while on RAM? Or encrypting the file/history of data copied into the clipboard? The Tor browser will very likely be included by default. We also plan to have an option to route all traffic via Tor, but this would require extensive testing to ensure everything works properly and there are no leaks.
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:02:52
Yup, this is in the pipeline. We will ship Electrum beta + MultiBit beta (probably not by default, but easily installable with a few clicks). QR creation/scanning tools will be installed by default. We consider hardware wallet support very important, and plan to support TREZOR, Ledger, HW-1 and possibly other upcoming hardware.

We are not backed by any company or anything like that, the goal is to produce a good system, free of any costs.
However, we hope to generate money to make the project sustainable:
* 0- Keep costs low
* 1- Donations
* 2- Crowd-funding for specific features that require more money (example: support for specific hardware)
* 3- Maybe sell physical media (DVD, USB)
* 4- Get sponsors to help with costs (Bitcoin exchanges, etc.)


Yes, the goal is to have a small script that produces an exact replica of the ISO offered for download. All small (and big) changes made to the system will be properly documented on the website in a simple and easy to understand language (eg. "This file contains the settings for the Desktop icons").

There are others, like [BitcoinOS]( -  A Linux distro based on Ubuntu with Bitcoin Core, Armory, Electrum and Multibit installed by default. A new/updated version with Electrum 2 (beta) and Multibit HD (beta) will be released in the coming weeks. (source: I'm the lead developer)
