Interesting method, but the way you describe it definitely works historically.  I wasn't paying as much attention to the GDAX the past few weeks, but on the depth chart we've got somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 coins to get to 25k from where we're at now as far as orders that have been placed already.  I'm not sure how that stacks up against the historical walls, but if you just follow the trendlines you'll see that past 20.1k it's pretty smooth heading to 25k, and virtually flat beyond there.   I'd imagine that if we're able to bust into the 25k range quickly then we are going to see explosive growth given that.  Seems a tall order, however.

We'll be 20k in a matter of days, if not hours.
Update:  Looks like hours was a bit more accurate.  I think we might see mid 20s very, very, soon.

It's at 19,592 as I'm typing this and ran up to that in about 5 minutes or less after stagnating at 19,500 for an hour or so.  Not sure where you saw that.

Lol... Market goes up 30% during his time in office and he uses one obscure asset's dip to indict an entire presidency

the 20k wall is for real.  Took us several hours to bust through a about 600 coins on GDAX, and I'm seeing something around 800 at 20k, which will take us a few hours to even get to.  I hope you're right!
Update:  The 20k wall is coming down tonight if this keeps up.  From there, who knows where we go?

I gotta admit I am not huge into investing so I can't really say.  My concern is that someone who is holding a lot of coin has the ability to cause a massive sell off and dip in price as we've seen recently, and that they will do this purposefully with futures.  I'm not sure how valid that is or isn't, but it's a concern I have.

19k sell wall.  Leggo 20k!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:01:43
Maybe I'm not understanding you or maybe I didn't communicate well myself.  
What I'm saying is that it looks to me as though there aren't many sells placed above 25k currently.  If we quickly got up to and past 25k, I'm not sure how quickly those limit orders for sales beyond that would be put in, and it would be interesting to see if we were able to get into a period of exponential growth because of that.  What are your thoughts on that?  (Hopefully I communicated better this time)

If GDAX and the bull we've been seeing today is any indicator then 20k will be but a moment's respite.  1-2hrs max.  Only thing I'd be concerned about is a bunch of people putting in a bunch of last minute sells, and being as it's a nice round number that seems reasonable.
That being said, I'd say selling at 20k is a mistake at this point.  There are signs pointing to this continuing on for at least a few thousand beyond that.  I've been watching all day.
Looks like we're hitting a lot of resistance at 19,750.  A lot of manual sells placed.  Do with that information what you will, but realize that we are charging right back up to 19750 for another run at it as we speak

Honestly it made a good run.  If anything it gives me further confidence in bitcoin ability to go all the way up past 20.  After that there's a big wall at 25k, but nothing insurmountable between those. 
I think we will see a lot of investors on board next week, a run up into the 25k range, and then a long period of stagnation.

Why post your amount?  Furthermore, why your ticket number?  Makes no sense.

If I wasn't already in buying the dip at 18400 I'd be buying it right now.  Zoom out and look at the orders, it's smooth sailing all the way to 20k again.  Oh boohoo only 10% gains in a few hours, haha

I don't know if I have any particular skills.  I did well today but that's because I had the time to watch and analyze the GDAX depth chart. 
Basically just look for a lot of activity and try to get a feel for how many coins are being bought in a given timeframe, and match that up against the limit orders which have been placed, and keep in mind that what you see with those is only a fraction of the larger overall activity.  You can identify walls upcoming in the short term, see how many coins they are, and compare that VS the coin buy rate per 10 mins or so.  If you are seeing a 1,000 coin wall and its taking 2 hours to break down a 30 coin wall then you have a guess as to how hard that is going to be to climb.  Make sense?
I wouldn't call myself an expert or even necessarily follow my advice by any means.  I just try and identify patterns and sometimes do a good job of it, sometimes don't.

20k is steep, a little more than 19k, but man unless people start putting in a bunch of sell orders now it is smooth as fuck sailing all the way to 25k.

Yellen was and is terrible.  Glad she's gone.

Too bad it's virtually impossible for newcomers to get verified on bitstamp these days. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:15:44
Thanks for your input!  Interesting to read your analysis for sure!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:52:38
A bunch of sell orders placed at a certain price point.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:02:59
Thanks for that!

You're doing your very best, even to the point of sacrificing on something you had high hopes for, all in the name of giving the thing you love most your everything.  If that isn't what winning looks like then I don't want to win.
You sound like you're judging yourself very harshly.  I bet you that beautiful child of yours never thinks negatively of you because you don't have 200KAUD extra right now.  I bet she just looks at you and thinks, "daddy, I love you".  So stop dwelling on the past, and start living in the now and loving yourself as well.   I bet you when you start doing that, you'll find happiness and success aren't far behind.

I'm using Gdax.  There may be better options, though.  
There are a lot of sells placed at 19k, but if we bust that I think this thing is going to rocket right up to 20
