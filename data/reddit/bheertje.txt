I had the same thing. 
They either changed to new owner or shutdown. The only one that actually had some coins of mine was fastpool and ltc rabit. Both couldnt get into my old account for some reason. This might not have been 2011. But its in range.

That would give a huge advantage to the website. They would hold information about your private keys. 
So depending on your goal here. I dont think people would like giving away their private keys there for like to give it away if there is not end goal for them.

Well, by my knowledge its not illegal to buy or sell "stocks" under 18. There are some rules and regulations, but they only effect you when you start earning ALOT of money without telling the so called "irs".

If you need any help just hit me up. I was planning on starting to build sort alike software after my midterms. I just took a glance at it, looks good for a guy that is self taught. Things i noticed were:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
    import re
in alot of functions, you only have to import it once. 
There is also a API for coinmarketcap. You're scraping the whole page every time. They might even block you after a while (since it will look like a mini ddos depending on how many calls you do).
Check out this:  and this:

Several coin exchanges hm. I do not know of any in existence. You could just combine multiple api's in your solution. The poloniex api does a decent job.
