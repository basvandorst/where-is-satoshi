I hear yah.. But lets be friends and talk like friends.. no need to call out my cynicism. I just wanted to know if I can make a quick 100 bucks overnight by messing around.. Maybe I should grow up a little?

okay silly question.. I have been using BTC for about a month now to pay my graphic designers in other countries. It has worked great, I am using Circle.com to do it.. Very nice site, whatever.. Now, I had like 3.20 left in there last week. Today I looked and its like 9.00...  So you mean to tell me if I had 100 in there last week I would have made a short term investment?  Like, really, its that easy?  Where do you see the price going today or overnight? Another huge spike?

Sounds great! I've been putting in $20 a week for a couple months. Can you don't math for that one? Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:25:38
Explain your math again? I think you're missing a couple words here and there.. 10/month (1000) for 23 years and make $24k???

I'm new to bitcoin but this seems weird. To me, much like propaganda; I'm freaking out. I'm going to fud out. Buy more bch, I only invested a cowards amount of less than 50%. My savings butt. I prefer when too many people say the same thing, so I'll now invest 50% and then 50%. More. I'll people saying the same stop, when people stop saming the say thing, I will stop. I wish i knew everything back 2013 when they were 50 bucks a piece. I'd have a fudkin Ferrari by now. I'm freaking out.
