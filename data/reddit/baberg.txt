The answer is, they can't.  Eventually, one day, Bitcoin could become a relatively stable currency.  But when a company has to reprice their goods on a minute-by-minute basis and the Bitcoins in their bank swing in value this largely on a day-by-day basis, it will never be accepted in large numbers.
$1 USD today gets me about the same amount of "stuff" as $1 USD got me last year.  1 Bitcoin gets me... who the hell knows?

The answer is that no reputable company would do so - at least, not now.  Maybe someday in the future it could become stable enough to be accepted as currency, but right now it's way too volatile.  USD in bank accounts don't change value by 1000% in a few weeks only to crash half of that back in a single day.  Stability is the name of the game and Bitcoin just proved it doesn't have it.

...because I'm desperate and bought in just yesterday and already down $6000 due to the bubble popping

Funny, I thought it looked more like this

You're asking Bitcoin fanatics, many of whom lost a lot of potential wealth in the past 24 hours, if it's a good time to buy and thus drive the price of their existing Bitcoins back up.
Why don't you go to DeBeers and ask them if you should buy a Diamond?  Or to one of the hundreds of gold selling sites and ask them if it's a good idea to buy gold?

Actually, I personally didn't drink the kool-aid.  I was speaking for the submitter of this article, begging people to buy into the hype for just a little while longer.

And that's somehow supposed to make me feel **more** confident in Bitcoin as a medium of exchange?

Are you familiar with the phrase "thowing good money after bad"?

The money in my pocket doesn't devalue when a bank gets robbed.  On the other hand, a 90% drop in the relative value of Bitcoin because a website gets hacked does decrease my confidence in Bitcoin as a stable and useful medium of exchange.
You can't have it both ways.  You want it to Bitcoins to be a currency?  Then it's going to have an exchange rate versus other currencies.  And when the rate fluctuates this wildly on a single day there is no confidence in that currency as a good medium of exchange.  No confidence = no usage.

Isn't in possible this DDOS was in fact people selling their bitcoins in a virtual "bank run"?
I'm not saying it is or isn't, but just admit to yourself that it's possible, please.

I find it hilariously appropriate that the picture used to visualize Bitcoins is a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:32
I don't think you can call 90% a "dip".  That's a bubble burst.  Just because another, larger bubble came along later doesn't mean that the first wasn't also a bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:04:44


Because having the exchange rate fluctuate 50% within 1 day is going to instill confidence in that currency as a stable and reliable exchange medium?  
You gotta take a step back man - you're in waaaaay too deep.

And yet the graph for Bitcoin looks EXACTLY LIKE this one starting in November of 2012, bear trap an all (March 10-15th or so).

For your next question, why don't you ask a bunch of gold miners if it's smart to buy gold?  Or maybe ask a jeweler if it's smart to buy a diamond?
This is the absolutely last place you want to go for advice on buying Bitcoins.  The people here have drunk the proverbial kool-aid.  More investors mean the price goes up, and their purses inflate.
