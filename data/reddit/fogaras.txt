So I just need to put Ex. RX 580+GTX 1070 and both cards will mine and that's it?

It was almost completely accurate so far , I don't fucking get why you have any reason to shitpost about it.
Bitcoin will definitely grow in price from where it currently is in the further future , we don't know how much , but it definitely will , and there's a lot of factors in play for why.

Doing 34.45mh/s on a single Rx 580 , you're doing something wrong kiddo
Try :
• Setting drivers to compute mode
• Memshifting your bios
• Underclocking and undervolting your core 
• Using low dag sizes 
• Adjust windows for maximum performance
