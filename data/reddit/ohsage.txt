Hey everyone,
Remember when overstock had over 100% of its stock shorted?  Naked shorted, that is.  Goldman Sachs did that, and got away with it on a technicality.  Stocks get manipulated, and clearly is with a positive concrete earnings report with subsequent drop.

Once faster options appeared alongside gox, the only reason I can see to keep me there would have been loyalty.  A month or two for withdrawals is nutty when you can do it in a week elsewhere.  Loyalty can be blinding.

Apple has a long history of attempting to sell products to customers that they didn't want.  They preyed on our loyalty and their kingpin stance with apps.  Remember the old iPods, with a small screen and long body?  It had buttons.  Consumers wanted them back and apple gave us anything but that.  
Sure the market is evolving.  Evolving to give customers what they want.  Fuck you apple, you burned me more than once and your employees resemble cult members.

There is an old saying relating to this 
"If a man's employment is conditional on him not understanding something, he will not understand it"
May not be verbatim, but it was along those lines and is true!
So they have an agenda to some extent, or rather their employer does and they are just an extension of that.  Sock puppets, pundits, manchurian candidates, they all seem to follow the old saying.

Ltc is behind btc but holds a lot of promise.  If you want to see a pump and dump look at nmc or nvc.  Ltc has massive volume and is moving relatively slowly compared to the more manipulated coins.

They will tax the equivalent of its value in fiat at the time it was acquired.  Same for stock options or gift cards that are exercised through a standard paycheck.  That is if you are receiving btc as a paycheck.

Sound the Nordic Horn, *BRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU*.  A battle a bureaucratic proportions is about to unfold.  Regulations are what make this country unfree, I cannot make my money dance across my bank accounts.  I can do that with bitcoin until these bastards ruin it.

Its a craze right now to be sure.  Integration is key to long term success, and appears to be really moving forward with bitcoin.  My original point is that there was no compelling reason to do so for btc for years.  I am personally betting on ltc, given that the founder is closely tied with bitcoins and has the resources to get it accepted.  That is speculation, but then btc was for years with nowhere to spend them.. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:15:36
Ah yes.  Indeed we are far into speculative territory.  Already the volatility has kept vendors away, bitpay corrects that on their end but the volatility still exists.  We are well beyond its value relevent to its integration.  I do see how dangerous it is for the future of Bitcoin, it can be incredibly annoying for people just using it as currency as well.  So about China being ignorant, I have to agree there too.  How many investors "get it"?  Im guessing about 5%
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:54:02
Coinbase isn't even selling coins.  I don't see much of an excuse for them to not transfer coins to their exchange either.  Deeply disappointed in them right now, almost as much as gox taking 7 weeks to withdraw fiat.

I am of the persuasion that they are a giant slow company that is highly leveraged.  You can withdraw fast if you are in Japan.  I'm sure they are benefiting in the ways you mention, but they seem secondary to its own staggering slowness like any big bank.      
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:08:24
It is a fine balance with bitcoin.  Try to spend them as close the the sun exploding as is possible for maximum benefit, that way you can enjoy the fruits of your patience for .00001 seconds.

I would like to point out that is is a known fact that news networks have human drones that work the social media factor big time.

Yes, ultimately it is still worth what the market says.  From one day to the next, from everything to nothing.  Information can drive the market, such as "enron is a scam".  If you got out just prior to its fall you still have the money. 
Good news is driving these coins up.  What other forces other than the market are dictating price?  The government?  
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:18:12
So while we are beyond its value relevant to integration, we know it has the potential to viably be worth 10k.  Regardless of our feelings and philosophy, rants and whatnot..  We all just stare and watch it show insane strength the likes of which are unprecedented.  
News stories of general instability always seem to turn the heat up for bitcoin prices.

It feels like we are storing away what would be hyperinflation in response to our rampant financial insanity.  That storage is like an explosive, and we just keep piling more on.  If it ever explodes we would have to immediately switch to a new world currency pretty fast.  Bitcoin feels more international, obviously won't replace a government currency.
Only Glob knows why it hasn't blown up yet, but if or when it does it will be nice to have digital bartering power.  Way will be more useful than infinite continentals.

5 years now.  That went by so quick.  I remember thinking it was the beginning of the bailout era when it began.  I have noticed that BTC goes up when traditional instruments go haywire.

If you have a verified bank account, have bought bitcoin from them already, waited 30 days after that and have a credit card.  You must fulfill all of that, and then pray you aren't "high risk" triggered by a faulty auto-fraud detection system.

Android is fractured for developers.  This hurts profits when you get a ton of bad reviews because you are building things for a Samsung Galaxy.  What percent of the marketshare is a galaxy?  The biggest piece perhaps, but still not much.  
Then people just root their phones and get apps for free on Android.  Developers regularly abandon their Android apps while continuing to develop their iOS side.  It's not worth the time.  Then developers release paid iOS apps, while making it FREE on android, pretty close to what they'd get if they charged a buck anyway.

By then anything could have happened.  10 days is nothing though, if you plan on withdrawing USD from gox it will take about 2 months.  Egopay/btc-e might be a better combo.  To each their own.  On the bright side, there may be a correction within 10 days and you can go long until the next feeding frenzy.  Or maybe it will still be going up and never go down.
