Pretty sure you’re saying the same thing. If not, I feel bad for you. He owes taxes for when he magically went from 3 BTC to 300 BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:36:48
Sorry that’s not how it works. I wish it did. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:58:01
And this is why taxes on this shit make no sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:07
Change to 14k!
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:04:33
Can’t buy on GDAX with a credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:07:07
225 in one and the rest next?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:50:56
If you do gift it, save the backup yourself.

I got that TLDR within 6 minutes, and skipping every 15 seconds or so 15 seconds ahead. What’s he talk about for 45 more minutes?

Probably stop there for a bit too. Psychological levels!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:16:19
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:57:51
WHY? Use GDAX for free transfers. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:10:17
Probably do it to multiple exchanges slowly. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:18:12
Wow, that’s really painful. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:20:05
Ask them not me? I’m just showing that they accept bitcoin. I’d guess they either want to contact you in the future for more money, or something related to nonprofits keeping track of who’s donating? Probably the first one.

Thanks for reminding people bby.

Satoshi has 1 million.

They accept it.

Just search this sub for more details. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:31
Also use Ethereum not bitcoin. Speeds it up. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:17:35
OP happened to me as well. Never spent any money. What a fool I was. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:23
If you verify your identity it’s more. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:25:53
They do not appear in Coinbase or GDAX. You do not own your bitcoin when they hold them. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:40:20
They’re connected, so you can free &amp; instantly transfer them between the two. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:53:45
I have 20 million bitcoins.

That’s a dumb strategy if you’re trying to safely save for schooling.

It’s illegal. Sorry.
