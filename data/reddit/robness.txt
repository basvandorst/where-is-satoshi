Zabos got the look at the screen like "hmmm I wanna have a beer with this guy and scrap out code."

You should look at the bitcoin investment map.  That will give you a ballpark on what's to come.

Modular decentralized systems is worth contemplating little lukejr.  Just because you code doesn't mean you have wisdom and foresight into future events.  Maybe you should take a break and tinker with Modular synthesis and make some music with your precious bitcoin rewards and possibly learn something outside your comfort zone.

If you don't think MMM global has anything to do with this. You're fucking morons.

If you don't think the govt can shut it down you guys are morons.  Bitcoin is easily co optable.  We all know it is easy yet we deny it.  The only reason bitcoin is allowed is because their is a power struggle between the banksters and the U.S govt.  The govt actually loves what Bitcoin is doing insofar as dismantling the power structures of the banks stranglehold and will allow it  long enough to do so.

I think you're wrong for correcting me.  Technically banks use fintech(albeit an archaic type).  I love how redditors feel the need to correct something they already understand.

Yeah the last paragraph fell off the wheels.  I almost was like wtf?  Went from rational to tinfoil hat at the drop of a.....tinfoil hat?

This comment was supported and paid for by a shitty attitude spawned from judgement on a blunder of the past.  Thanks for your clever comment.

Best post on r/bitcoin since forever.  These vibes need to be here more often.

Yeah that's a great point actually. Money these days is such a serious affair.  The fact that Bitcoin can morph into any type of value transference ideal could make money a fun affair again.

That's a sorry excuse for why this post is upvoted onto the front page for OBVIOUS reasons.  Your typical cynic intellectualism doesn't apply here.

I don't know why this is such a big fucking deal.  Coinbase wallet funds......sent to another anonymous wallet.  Then send funds to gambling site.  I thought you guys were pros in here.

I can't believe you idiots buy this shit.  Guy is a douche and likes playing with all your minds.......sad thing is it's working.  at it's best.

GOOD.

I've said this once and I'll say it again.  Eric Lombrozo's brain is being entirely overlooked by the bitcoin community and I believe he should be listened to more.  When I saw the whole San Diego scaling conference I remember going "man.....this guy is just throwing the gauntlet down."  Glad to see others are noticing.

I'll be sending you this in paper format.  I wrote it and maybe it'll help kill time and transport you out of there in mind.    Hey man, we all make mistakes and like Jimi Hendrix says "If I hit a wrong note I always resolve it with the next one."

Commenting on the grammatical errors of someone who might have typed it on their phone and really didn't care doesn't make you look any more of a smarter person.
