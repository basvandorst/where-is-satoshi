"Segregated witness is cool, but it isn’t a short-term solution to the problems we’re already seeing as we run into the one-megabyte block size limit." 
From software engineering point of view, segwit changes lots of code LOGIC, this kind of change is extremely dangerous since it changes software behavior and could cause many unforeseeable security hole and attack vector, so it should be implemented in a much slower pace, at least one to two years
One example, if miners trigger the activation of segwit then reverse it due to some compatibility problem, then suddenly there will be segwit style "anyonecanspend" transactions everywhere for miners to grab. And that basically killed the network. So once segwit is on, and it failed, there is no way back, it could be an extinction level event

Not when now there are anti-core miners. Before, miners have been trusting core devs so they blindly listen to them (and lost lots of money during July 04 fork last year), now core devs have proved that they are not totally trustworthy. So it becomes a gaming, anti-core miners will try all the possible way to fork segwit net, and since segwit have so many logic flaw and security holes, it is so easy to fork it

Block size limit has become an excuse of each different faction to realize their vision of bitcoin, since each of the core devs have different visions, it is a deadlock situation, no hope of any consensus being reached among core devs right now.

but if you could not find an exchange/merchant that is running the same version at yours, your coins will become useless. In fact, if your version is not protected by the biggest mining hash power your transaction might fail easily. So, the bitcoin protocol is the most centralized thing in bitcoin ecosystem, because of this, we are seeing all the political struggles around this single point of dominance
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:10:25
You can fork to another set of code easily, but you can't fork the whole ecosystem, e.g. community, investors, miners, exchanges, etc... Not everyone have the same weight in this ecosystem, miners and exchanges almost decided which version is "currently official". And the investor who has the most coins can decide which chain can survive economically if there is a fork (trying to fork your own coin and establish your own exchange? The moment your exchange is up and running, you will face millions of coins dumped from pre-fork coin holder)

This is only theoretically, if your new coin can not be traded anywhere, it is just an alt-coin, you have to start over the value establishing phase of bitcoin for the past 7 years, setting up exchanges, persuade merchants to use your version... And also your exchange rate will be dumped to zero right away by the pre-fork coins from other chains

It depends on how ambitious the Bitpay is. If Bitpay simply dump all the coins on exchanges, that will create temporary down side pressure for exchange rate. However, they could build up the bitcoin reserve and paying merchant using fiat money reserve, thus creating a source of price stability (By buying low and selling high). This is very possible, because they have to handle so many transactions daily, a reserve is a very natural outcome, the only question is how big that reserve will be, if they are enough ambitious, they could build up a reserve that absorb all the bitcoin selling pressure during one year

First, hard fork is not the same as chain split, you have many ways to cause a chain split, both soft fork and hard fork can cause chain split under certain conditions
But ultimately a chain split is caused by that the community can not reach agreement on the way forward and decided to go each own path. So far this has not happened but the current dead lock situation (e.g. none of the proposal can get major consensus) would make this more likely in the long run, or bitcoin will be overtaken by an altcoin

gold's industry use is minimal to its large supply, if all the central banks dump their gold reserve, the value of gold will drop to single digits since there are not enough money to buy them at current price, and there is no such large demand.

When a large bank upgrading their system, all the users of that bank can not access the banking service for the whole night/weekend, no one cares and network did not break. Sometimes when they had an incident, that happened during middle of the day and suddenly all the payment could not be done in the whole country, still no one cares, only a piece of news appear on the newspaper
The point is that bitcoin is "use at your own risk" technology, no one is responsible for anyone's bitcoin loss due to devs or hard forks, so it is the user's responsibility to keep himself updated with the latest change in bitcoin, not devs. Devs only need to present the solution and let users make choice
In real world, if you want me to use your solution and say it is safe, I don't want a promise or claim, I want an insurance contract: In case your proposal failed, you must compensate all the loss caused by your solution. Obviously no one in bitcoin space can provide such insurance, so everyone would make their own judgement regardless what others say

Segwit specifically set up 25% fee discount for signatures to encourage centralized servcies: Who would be benefit most from those multiple input and output transactions? Centralized wallet service providers. That's the reason you can see all core supporters are those small wallet service providers.

You can not replace bitcoin with anything else, just look at all those alt-coins... Similar to bitcoin, gold just had a first mover advantage, because primitive human were not able to discover better metal like platinum or palladium
All the industry usage of gold can be satisfied by less than 10% of existing gold, and many of them can be replaced by other metals and especially modern alloy. Gold has quit transaction because you can not tell if it is genuine without special devices, the reason it still holds its value is because people hold majority of them, exactly like they do with bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:27:12
By including a transaction, the block get larger, thus have higher risk of being orphaned, if it happens then they lose all the 25btc altogether, therefore there is a fee to hedge this risk

This perfectly demonstrated that bitcoin is already being controlled by Blockstream, and that's the biggest problem we have to solve right now

No, but that is how backing works in fiat money creation. Some people will argue that if everyone goes to redeem the backed asset, then the fiat money will crash. But the reality is that the price of that asset will rise dramatically under large redeem pressure, which in turn create a large sell pressure, might even crash the price later on, which gives central bank a reason to create even more money, so it is always self-balancing once started

When people talk about crash, they always mean the crash of something's USD price, so they have an unconscious habit of using USD as the standard unit of value. So once USD get rid of its tie with gold, it can be printed as much as possible while maintain its value by its own, as long as the inflation for daily consumption is low (That matters for 99% of the population). This is a scam but most of the people do not care and they want USD

Since segwit has a 1:4 discount of witness data, it means for each 1MB real transaction data, you have to prepare 4MB witness data bandwidth. If segwit is implemented, the real bandwidth requirement will immediately rise by 4X and make any future block size increase impractical, so segwit is a very bad solution for scaling
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:37:52
The white paper is terribly written, none of the in channel details are described clearly, it writes like both parties are sitting side by side in a meeting room. In reality, both party must first trust each other, which makes the channel useless: If you can trust your partner, you won't need all this technical complexity
The fundamental problem with the LN is that it does not have a single point of truth: One side sees the process being finished does not guarantee the other side also see the same thing. This disagreement of the current channel status can be explored to carry much more sophisticated attacks
A very simple example: At the last step of their signature exchanging, who are making the last step can skip sending his part to the other while he has already received the part from the other fully. Thus he can broadcast the transaction at will while the other can not because of lacking of his signature
Of course the loss is still limited at the channel/step, but that means each channel/step must be risk managed to be enough small, which makes LN more or less like any current off-chain solutions: You just use a sql database and risk manage them. Much simpler than all those complexities in LN
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:00:02
Normal people will never use LN person to person, they only interact with those exchanges and web wallets, and those actors will become the LN hubs for sure.

It's the traditional"Who pays first" problem in any financial transaction: Those who give out the signature first would grant the other party right to boradcast the transaction, depends on the amount of money involved,  no one what to do that first
You can design whatever complex scheme you want, but I highly doubt that you can solve the fundamental question of transaction fidelity without a single point of truth. Bitcoin uses blockchain to solve this problem, without blockchain, it sounds like a perpetual motion machine

Private blockchains are like intranet, have their limited usage inside the banking system to reduce their cost, has nothing to do with bitcoin

It is similar to the move from IPv4 to IPv6, when the capacity really becomes a problem, people will reach agreement easier. Currently this worry is just imaginary. When there is an overwhelming majority of voice that they want to do the transaction on the main chain and the fee is too high, the block size will be lifted quickly, since that is just one line of code change
In fact, due to that majority of people are doing long term holding and speculation on exchanges, this requirement for daily transaction will be very low unless a lot of gambling sites are using bitcoin. The biggest problem is caused by the transaction intensive enterprises trying to utilize the blockchain for their own interest, but this can be solved by their own solution: Banks all have their own clearing channel when they are not doing transactions against FED, while Fedwire only handles 4tps
Bitcoin already handles 4tps, so if it will become a system similar to Fedwire, it is already ok. When the blocks are full, small transactions will move to clearing based solutions (in fact majority of the small transactions are done offchain today already). But if the decentralization can be guaranteed and average people's home computer and network bandwidth can handle large blocks easily, then it does not hurt to raise it a bit. But still, you can't have all the transactions handled by P2P network, that is an extreme waste of resource and low efficiency. You don't need Fedwire level of trust when you are purchasing coffee
The genesis block has already indicated that bitcoin is trying to solve the untrustworthy problem at the money creation level, e.g. central banks. So that no money can be created out of thin air. And there is a built in payment mechanism to do the initial distribution, but the user level concern is not a central bank's task. You just need a little bit insurance on those institutions so that they can be trusted by average consumer
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:07:25
Notice that bitcoin's value is basically decided by mining cost, with another POW, the mining cost will be reset, means the coin's value will also be reset, so your coin will reset to 2010, while the existing POW will still be bitcoin

Backed by gold or land or asset is the typical trick by fiat money issuer. The backing eliminated people's worry about a money's value, even they never need to redeem that backing
Bitcoin is backed by all the buyers with their fiat money on all the exchanges and all the merchants who are providing products and services for bitcoin payment. The difference is that the backing's value is dynamic, not at a fixed rate like gold backed notes. The value of the backing changes constantly, so does the value of bitcoin. But overall, the scale of these backing are growing year over year
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:47:18
Both parties can reach agreement on a specific transaction once it enters the blockchain, Alice does not need Bob's permission to get a transaction into blockchain
But in a payment channel, they are dependent on each other asymmetrically time wise: Bob can say that he sent Alice the signature but Alice did not receive it. You have no way to tell if Bob indeed sent her something since there is no single point of truth
If fact, if a payment channel can solve this problem, then the whole invent of bitcoin will be unecessary, LN coin will already succeed 20 years ago when signature scheme was invented

LN are centralised hubs that reduce bitcoin's value, and before it even adopts (21inc's LN has been delivered for over a year and still no one use it), some other cryptocurrencies will already take the low value transaction segment for sure since no one will use LN as proven by market

That's the best you can say? It is enough convincing if you can demonstrate in concept how two parties of a trade could reach agreement on the current balance status if they don't have a single point of truth
Bitcoin solve this problem by using a database as single point of truth: Blockchain. But in LN there is no such thing

Segwit is just a improvement of the transaction format to get rid of the malleability bug, if implemented as a hard fork, it is fine, since it does not need that strange witness block to screw up the economy incentive model in current bitcoin ecosystem. As a soft fork it brings much more problem than it solves, maybe that is intentional
@_date: 2016-01-08 05:30:35
The final definition of a soft fork is shocking: "blocks that would have been valid under the old rules may become invalid under the new rules"
Let's see the whole picture here:
1) a block is valid for old client and also valid for new client
2) a block is valid for old client but invalid for new client
3) a block is invalid for old client and also invalid for new client
4) a block is invalid for old client but valid for new client
The standard definition of soft fork should be satisfying both 1 and 3, but now they have changed the definition by saying that a soft fork is 2 and 3, how is this backward compatible? If an old client generated blocks will not be accepted by the new client, then the new client is not backward compatible, it is a hard fork
@_date: 2016-03-17 07:34:09
That's true, banks could always cover their loss in the end through other means.  Anyway there is no FDIC for bitcoin, and it is constantly advertised as an experiment, and we are still at very early stage of this experiment, should not be afraid to make mistake at this stage, practicing hard fork will clear the way to many potential good improvements

Unfortunately, with the implementation of segwit, all the transaction format and blockchain itself will change to something else, so you have to decide to follow or not. If you are a large miner, you either upgrade, or fork 
From higher level of abstraction, the consensus is only 21 million coins, any other rules can be changed. 
But in reality, community has already split because of a different view on bitcoin's scaling, so there will be fork, then both chain will claim the other chain alt-coin. Since no one can stop a fork, and no one can stop a group of people supporting a fork, it seems the bitcoin is doomed either way

Totally opposite, soft fork is bad because it is cheating, it can trigger uncontrollable hard fork at any time without any sign, see July 04 hard fork. Hard fork however is much more well planned and with major consensus it is a sure fire. Hard fork is only bad when no major consensus is behind it, but soft fork will also cause hard fork when there is no major consensus. So ultimately it is the consensus matters, not soft or hard fork. Since soft fork is cheating, hard fork is always better given same major consensus condition

What? If they use a big bus that can take double the amount of weight (blocksize increase) , they could earn 8*200=$1600 instead of $1000 if they just used a trailer. They earn much less by using a trailer and reduced fee income for the load on that trailer
Since the validation of the signature is the most resource consuming part of the node process, it does not matter where that signature is located. By allowing more weight in the trailer, they increase their chance of their block being orphaned
I remember that BTCC did a calculation saying that 6 seconds delay in validation is already 1% drop of revenue, which they consider to be significant. They might even want to raise the fee on the signature part

The reason for bitcoin's creation is specified in the genesis block: To stop bankers print endless money to bailout themselves. A money with limited supply. It is politically neutral
Western governments can adopt bitcoin and abandon fiat money since they don't have the right to create fiat money either. But it will take decades of fight against banks to reach that stage if ever possible (99.99% of the people have been seduced by fiat money for too long),  trying to hide from the government is never going to make that happen
@_date: 2016-09-15 01:06:54
True, currently bitcoin is very different than the OSI model, all the check of the validity of a block is done in one layer, so what can we do to make it into a layered structure? 
There are different realizations for multiple layers:
* 1. Layer one consists thousands of enterprise level nodes around the world that can do 1GB blocks and layer two consists of millions of SPV nodes
This is the approach of bitcoin classic, easy to implement and easy to scale up if bitcoin is allowed by governments (Then you can build lots of server farms for nodes around the world). If bitcoin is not allowed by governments then we have much more serious concern than scaling
* 2. Layer one provide basic functions like preventing double spending and inflation, keep blockchain in order, and layer two provide other functions like advanced scripting and block size limit, so that a failed script or a huge block would be stopped at layer two instead of layer one, never affect the basic function
Removing the block size limit from the protocol (bitcoin unlimited) is getting close to this solution. Layer one protocol should only decide the validity of a block based on its POW and all the security check. The size of a block should never be the reason to reject a block, just like your router will never reject a huge file containing virus: That is handled at higher layers
This will greatly simplify the layer one functions, and the mission of preventing huge spam blocks will fall on the shoulder of miners at layer two: They use their hash power to orphan huge blocks, and since miners are the decision maker in blockchain direction, they know very well what blocksize is best for the network, at least much better than any other users. They chould develop a layer two protocol to increase their coopearation. And if that layer two protocol is broken, you just get a couple of large blocks written in the blockchain, still a valid blockchain, not like today, you get a chain fork
* 3. Layer one of settlement nodes and layer two of private nodes
This approach is the lightning network and the lightning network inventor said he borrowed the idea from traditional financial system. IMO this is a worst approach since it totally changes bitcoin back into a system like we have today, where lightning hubs become the new banks and too big to fail as a result (An attack towards major lightning hubs will freeze the whole network if lightning network get wide adoption and each hub takes hundreds or more transactions per second)

Trying to make bitcoin government resistant is totally a waste of time, government never need to go the IP route, they just ban you through a law like they did in China and Russia, then all the legitimate business will go down and bitcoin become a black market criminal money, without masses to provide liquidity and the entry/exit towards fiat money is blocked, 10 billion market cap is not going to hold. If you are looking for 100 billion or even higher market cap, you must talk to world's governments and get them on board. If they are on board, then any kind of infrastructure can be built
Just look at USD or Euro, even as large as a sovereign currency, they are still banned from circulation in China or Russia or any other sovereign country in general. Bitcoin can at its best become just another foreign currency for most of the countries: Can be exchanged but does not allow circulation, more or less a WOW gold level thing, used by a specific group of users in some specific application, mostly saving and investment oriented area
Bitcoin is still a game, don't take it too serious, thinking that you can resist the government through a couple of lines of code showing you have a misunderstanding of how the world works

What cypherpunks do is to create tools and means to increase the privacy, and that right is lawful, so I don't think they are against government. But besides privacy, you have also many other concerns to balance
Take AML/KYC rules for example, it seems to be a quite hated measure by lots of community members since it hurts privacy. But if you really do a lot of bitcoin trade, you will understand why AML/KYC is a must: Without it, there are just waves and waves of thieves and scammers everywhere, you don't even know who is paying you, most possibly money comes from scammed or stolen accounts. Just ask P2P exchange localbitcoins or bitsquare why this is a must for even the smallest amount of bitcoin transaction. Why localbitcoin is banned in Russia recently? Too many such scammers and caused too much losses for victims

Miners receive only 1/4 of the fee for the signature part of the transaction data in segwit transactions, so there is no any logical reason that they will include segwit transactions at all
Any included data, regardless tx or signature, consumes miners' bandwidth and CPU resource and increase the chance of orphan of the mined blocks, so they must demand to be paid by including any data, but including signature data is a voluntarily contribution for segwit with significantly reduced income
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:22:22
Let me explain segwit in layman's terms:
You have a mini bus that can sit 8 people, or 8x70kg, but every people entering the bus have a large lugage (signature) as heavy as them (70kg), so actually it sits only 4 people since the mini bus have a total carry weight limitation of 560kg
Now you put a large trailer on its tail (segwit) and tell everyone to throw their lugage into that trailer, and for each lugage they will only need to pay 1/4 of the price for a ticket. Now the bus can sit 8 people, and all the other lugages are put into the trailer, and some traveler can even bring 2 or 4 lugages
Suppose that a ticket cost $100, if Alice put the lugage in the mini bus, she will buy an extra ticket thus she has to pay $200, if her lugage is in the trailer, she will pay $100+$100/4=$125, obviously it is a reduce of the price for her
But how about the company that operates the bus (miners)? Suppose that bus can sit 8 person with their lugage in the trailer now, the bus can carry extra weight while receiving less income per weight in trailer part, but it does not cost them any less fuel or less wear of the equipment for the same amount of weight, regardless if those weight are in the bus or in the trailer
In fact, they might even need to take a long route because the bus is non-standard thus might be rejected by some of the toll stations(nodes), which cost them more time and higher risk of being late. If the bus missed the next train (orphaned), then the bus company have to return all the ticket income to travelers and ask them to take another bus
So from bus company's view, there is no reason to go this risky route and reduce their income at the same time. If they want more income, they simply upgrade to larger buses and still charge the same fee per weight as before

Today's bitcoin ecosystem is already largely driven by enterprises: large exchanges, online wallets, payment processors, industrial miners... If government decided to ban bitcoin, they will start with those businesses, and when all these users/businesses are gone, the traffic will drop to a level that anyone can run a full node
In fact that's the reason for lightning network: Since most of the transactions today are concentrated at a few large financial hubs,  establish payment channels between these hubs seems to be able to achieve high capacity. But what if government hit those hubs?
So, if government support bitcoin, solution 1 and 2 works, 3 is dangerous, if government does not support bitcoin, traffic will drop dramatically, 1MB is enough for black market usage

Yes, another people also mistaken my slide as using 0.5MB blocks to orphan old blocks, it should not be the case, I did not draw the picture well, now updated with newer version. just like you said, using BIP9 version bits should be enough
Nodes on the stopped chain are not very important, since nodes without hash power can do no harm to the network or the user, it just like a node lost electricity
BTCC has setup hundreds of nodes several months ago, indicating that spin up several thousand nodes are not that difficult if there is really a big demand for that
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:12:09
I don't restrict anything in phase I, non-mining nodes would still use normal transactions as usual. But in phase two after larger blocks start to appear, non-mining nodes just can't do any transaction at all, since their blockchain is stopped, this is the same as not able to sign a transaction, much simpler. Why a thousand lines of code when you can do it in a few lines

That's why soft fork is considered a 51% attack to the network, if such orphaning action is in place, a hard fork will immediately happen 
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:29:34
Full nodes will simply stop working once there is one single block that is larger than 1MB appear in the network, but that might happen much later into phase 2, when most the full nodes have already upgraded to newer version
Once that larger block appear, all the non-upgraded nodes will stop working totally, they can not send/receive transaction, and they won't receive new blocks, just like their internet has been disconnected. So they will not be attacked by anybody, they just got frozen forever
It is not quite safe for minority miners, but it is the same as any soft fork, minority miners always risk being orphaned. But it is safe for nodes and it is safe for the currency

Currently it is limited by 2000 transactions per 10 minute and if there are 4000 people waiting in the line every 10 minutes, half of them would never be able to use bitcoin to do transaction, so they have to use services that do off-chain transactions
A simple example is buying a monthly card for local traffic thus combine 60 credit card transactions (2 travels per day) into a single one (Prepaid card is the origin of payment channel e.g. LN). But then who is going to issue those prepaid cards? Exchanges and web wallets for sure
So by capping the blocksize limit you transform bitcoin into a centralized traditional financial network that sell prepaid cards
The biggest problem with other scaling approaches is that they greatly increase the operational complexity thus only a few large institutions are capable of running such solutions. Raised level of complexity is the biggest reason for centralization. If you have two scaling options: one is to just buy a large hard drive and get faster PC and internet connection, another one is to setup a set of complex software solutions that almost no one understand how it really works, and risk losing money in the process, I think the former will reach much wider adoption thus become much better decentralized

Cap the limit will force transaction into those centralized institutions like exchanges and web wallets, that will even more severely increase centralization pressure, since the number of those institutions are much less than full nodes today, a handful of them to be more precisely
That kind of centralization is already getting worse and worse today, if most of the traffic go through these financial hubs using LN and they were taken over by governments, then the bitcoin network will collapse, or they just collapse like MTGOX and create devastating effect
Today's full nodes already can handle 4MB blocks easily, which is much more than enough for another 5 years, it is magnitudes higher decentralization than caped block size approach
@_date: 2016-07-14 05:06:40
There are plenty of evidence that today's network infrastructure can handle 4MB or 8MB block size, and in future 32MB should be no problem
If you keep block crippled, then many people will be forced to use 
centralized service providers (LN hubs for example), this totally defeated the decentralized property of bitcoin, and bitcoin value will crash long before that is even implemented
No matter how many people have bought bitcoin, if one day there is no buyer, then its price will immediately go to zero. Who do you think will buy bitcoin if it is impossible to use it, or need to use it through a third party like bank
