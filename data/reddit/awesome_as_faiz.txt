He also spent years studying math, computer science and cryptography among other important subjects. The real cost was his education.

Fair enough.


This is true, but you have to be clear on the difference between [goods]( and [currency]( However, I would be careful about taking anything on wikipedia as a set definition on any of these terms.
If we can get back to the original argument, you are correct that no person has to value anything personally. Theoretically nothing in existence has intrinsic value and by that standard you can not 
I think you'd be interested in the [subjective theory of value]( but again this is a theory primarily concerning goods.

It's easy to get worked up on reddit and take things too seriously, even though it helps nothing. I apologize for being rude and for my condescension. Appreciate you being the bigger person here.

It's a copypasta people, calm down.

Bitcoin not over 10k right now...
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:33:37
Following the recent spike to almost $14k, the price will fluctuate less and less around $10k-$12k before starting to level out. Then it will drop off a "cliff" to somewhere ~$6k-~9k (the valley). This will be similar to the drop from $6.4k to $3.2k in Nov/Dec 2018, though not as drastic and not as lengthy. This is when you buy in. It will remain in the "valley" for anywhere from a week to a few months before rising slowly at first and then hitting a bull market around the end of the year or early 2020.
Keep in mind that this prediction is less accurate with respect to time. In the short term, it will certainly do what I've suggested, but long term (more than 2 months in the future) things are less likely to be exactly as I've predicted. 
Or course all of this is only predicated on no major news that would affect Bitcoin in the next 6 months. Coinbase crashing, Google introducing a cryptocurrency, Trump tweeting about Bitcoin, etc. are all examples of wild cards that cannot be predicted and may set off an immediate bull/bear run. However, it will likely correct and return to normal over a month or two.
The best bet is to wait for the "cliff" I described, then to put everything in and Hodl for at least 6 months. Eventually, the price will go up as Bitcoin continues to become more mainstream. right now people generally are aware of Bitcoin, but they are scared because of the 2017 bubble. That fear will dissipate as it is discussed more in the media toward the end of the year and people realize it wasn't just a fad.
After 2025 is hard to predict because there may be new technological advancements we can't prepare for. However, between now and 2025, Bitcoin will continue on its upward trajectory before plateauing at some point. My prediction is a little under $100k, but some may call me conservative.
If you don't want to worry about fluctuations, the best bet is to buy in now and just HODL for at least 1-2 years, then reevaluate your options. No matter what, don't invest any more than you are willing to lose entirely.

The difference between 18 months and a few years.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:20:46
That’s actually the only time I’ve asked that question and we both know why you can’t answer it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:30:17


What you said was factually incorrect and doesn’t make any sense. If the facts are irrelevant to you, why are you even arguing about anything?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:51:13
Lol how many people do you think live in caves outside of government authority? Baseball and Snake are not currencies.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:04:46
It’s not “the last few years”.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:32:00


Nope, we're not.


Absolutely wrong.


No it is not.


You are starting to understand that there is a difference between economic value and philosophical value. but you still sound confused.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:50:01
That was less than 2 years ago.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:46:36


I don't think you have.




Monetary. Not Monitary.


This is cute. At the beginning of this conversation, I thought you had more of an understanding of economic terms than I now realize. When people are discussing finance or economics, they typically use the definitions of terms widely understood within that subject. They don't tend to pick and choose the optional definitions under Merriam-Webster. Here is an easy starting point where you can learn what is meant by value, currency, money and other basic economic concepts: 
Value is a concept that has two widely understood meanings depending on the subject you are discussing. In economics, Value [means something specific]( however you can also discuss it from a [philosophical/ethical perspective]( (check the bot response below this comment)


I appreciate that you are interested in diving into these subjects and learning more, but it's bad form to argue with someone about a subject you are still learning about.


No, in the hypothetical you described to me in the previous comment, sea shells are not currency. 


Sea shells could be a currency under certain hypothetical situations, but the one you described previously is not that situation.


Not if they are currency, no it does not work like that.
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:18:20


As long as you aren't, that's good.


First off, if we're going to continue this moronic debate, don't put quotes around something that I did not ever say. If you somehow misread a comment, that's one thing. If you are deliberately misrepresenting my argument, that is called a straw man, and that is wholly dishonest.
Second, by definition currency has value.
Third, unless there is nation in which sea shells are a generally accepted form of money, it is not a currency.


What you are describing is an asset, not a currency.


You could not be more wrong about something. Purchasing power is quite literally the value of a currency in terms of the goods or services it can be exchanged for.


Are you conflating economic value with philosophical value or do you not know the difference between the two? I'm genuinely asking because that may explain your confusion here. Economic value and philosophical value are two entirely different concepts.


No, that is not accurate at all unless you are purely speaking of philosophical value.


No, that is not how you turn something in to money. That would be selling a product. Products are not currency.


Right, you can price your products however you see fit in a capitalist system. That does not mean that sea shells are currency, nor does it mean that the economic value of currency is subjective.


I am now certain that you do not understand what currency is. Sea shells in this hypothetical are not currency.


If you think that is what I have suggested, the you have significantly misunderstood and still do not grasp basic economic concepts.

It’s not being pedantic if the fact is central to your entire argument. You’re the cunt, calling me stupid for pointing out an blatantly incorrect objective fact. People have not made a loss on bitcoin over the past few years. Anyone who bought in to bitcoin a few years ago and heldnow has more money. The only people who have made a loss are those who bought within a 6 week period out of the entire existence of bitcoin, which was roughly 18 months ago.
Your entire argument is that bitcoin is not at an all time high, which every single person knows. Except that you’re exaggerating the narrative by claiming people have made a loss over the last few years, which is objectively false.
You also clearly don’t have better things to do since you’re throwing a temper tantrum because your false claims weren’t accepted at face value.

No, actually 1 USD = ~62 MZN, regardless of your personal opposition to it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:58:52
Nah you're a very dishonest person. What's my investment?
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:44:12
Yes, because it has value for the world's population not just people who own it. If you don't own any fiat currency that doesn't mean fiat has no value to you or you're "not participating".
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:17:16
It wasn't a well known point in time for you, since you thought it was a few years ago.
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:23:40
No, it has value to anyone who is aware of monetary value or currency. Some Americans may not know about the country of Mozambique, but that country’s currency has value against the USD regardless.
Theoretically, some people may “live in caves” outside the confines of the global economy, but it would be a negligible population in terms of single digit percentages.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:29:01
I'm beginning to doubt that you can rationalize a position. Sea shells and video game scores are not the same thing as national currency. If that is not clear to you, you should not be investing your parents' money.
The value of national currency is not determined by your own personal subjective feelings. It is determined by government policy and the foreign exchange market.
We've been back and forth multiple times now and you are continuing to demonstrate that you cannot grasp the basic principles of monetary value. Please for your own good do not play around with money before you understand these concepts.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:19:14
Who created this?
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:23:03
What are you even talking about? A score of 1 in Snake does not have any monetary value. Bitcoin is a currency and it has value in your nation's economy whether or not you own any.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:10:46
No it's definitely not. Please tell me you have not invested any of your parents' money.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:52:22
Context makes it blatantly obvious that you are a disingenuous person. Where did I mention my investment?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:43:37
If you get this angry over being corrected about something that is objectively and factually wrong, you're the one that is going to get screwed mate. When it comes to money, exact numbers matter. The difference between 18 months and "a few years" isn't negligible. You're also now trying to pretend "a few years" means 2 years, which shows not only are you stupid, but you're disingenuous, so no one should be listening to you.
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:38:34
Currency is not subjective.
