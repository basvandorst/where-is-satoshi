But the buyer needs bitcoin to reach $13,510 before they "break even" on the purchase. It was at $10,300 earlier today (going down), so anything over $11,000 the customer will feel robbed at the ATM. 
Cash.app charges $0 fees, they will add a spread if the price is going crazy between purchase time and transfer. They have millions of users of the app and its one of the top ones in the store. 
It's not even a delusional dream that 20% fee for buying bitcoin is somehow necessary anywhere. The greedy rent seekers will get crushed in this business.

You just need the internet for a bank account in bitcoin


The system doesnt do that for your safety, it's to track both of your money for governments 


Dont do that? Seriously, how hard do you think it is to double check, triple check sending your cash payment to someone? Its not hard or that different from handing someone cash for a product that may not work... 


100's of apps like breadwallet / cash.app / shakepay / revolut in every country along with things like mycelium trader for those that don't want bitcoin tracked to banking? Just a guess... the cash is going away. The central banks wont prove their money supply is in order so everyone just goes to bitcoin anyways. 
We are 100% losing cash sooner rather than later, why anyone would trust a central bank for sound money via is fucking beyond me. 


If you used BRD wallet, some of these are freaking easy, give it 10 years and see how much better it is. Torrenting sucked when it started, now its super easy.

Bitcoin is doing fine for a ten year old technology? Not sure what you're on...  
ATM's are a huge scam and more P2P apps will probably launch before bitcoin ATM's become popular. 
If I can hold $200 - $500 worth of bitcoin in a wallet on my phone that connects me to a buyer with cash in my area, for a 1-2% fee, I would probably do that. 
Mycelium Trader does that now. I expect more to launch like that, rather than big boxes with Fiat that people need to go to gas stations and pay these kind of fees to get bitcoin lol.

Approximately 30-40 million people globally hold bitcoin now, what would Trump do to stop the world from using the internet? 


It's mostly Libra, and other companies trying to create currencies. Bitcoin is a little different, similar to how difficult torrenting is to take down. 
We expect them to make bitcoin purchases difficult in US. They have to watch they dont lose reserve currency status, while trying to police the internet and how everyone spends their money globally. And maintain their empire as global super power....while controlling the monetary system globally.... good luck.
Billions of people can still purchase bitcoin today even if it is difficult in the USA. If anything it's a tiny global protest for sound money.

Physical banks are like retail stores, user habits/preferences are changing therefore the leases for these buildings dont make as much sense as time goes on. People arent shopping or banking between the hours of 9-5 always, the internet is just there for people to use whenever... its laughable really. 
Banking was going that way anyways, bitcoin will just speed up the process and give the banks a reason to adapt their businesses quicker. 
Banks are part of a cartel in every country that help the central bank monitor the economy for the government though. You cant print more money without knowing how much everyone is storing in banks and how much banks are lending out. What is consumer/business debt, what amount of credit is looking bad etc... 
It would be VERY weird to lose that practice in a country overall. Parts of it get taken out though in places nobody trusts their banks through cash, gold or now bitcoin I guess.

When you use the banking system (credit, debit, wire) the transaction is recorded obviously in your bank account. 
With the KYC/AML verification process at the exchanges, it easily links your data to the data the banking system holds. Governments can ask either for your transaction history whenever they want.

Everyone rented movies at one time.
We can actually draw parallels with netflix and banking if you think about how nobody buys dvd's or cd's (spotify) anymore. 
Banks barely even hold money anymore, the vault won't be needed when paper money is removed. The arguments to keep paper money decline over time easily. 
It costs $0.14 to print a $100 US bill. The banks will have to digitize those AND have holders of the money believe there is intrinsic value. 
Banks can't create intrinsic value with digital currencies as easily as economists want to believe because the obvious question will be "what's your money supply?" 
There are estimates of money amounts and gold countries hold but actual audits and proof are hard to get from any of them. The case for bitcoin and gold only gets better as the banks need to show value to holders of money :)

Wouldnt the reserve be part of the BTC for Sale that exchanges use to show customers that are going to buy bitcoin? Then that bitcoin moves to the user account and the customer can move it to another wallet? 
Then the reverse would be an allocated Fiat amount viewable of fiat to buy customers bitcoin that moves to customers accounts and can be withdrawn however? 
Customers could technically come into an exchange with 50000 BTC and the exchange just doesnt have that amount reserved for someone wanting to sell..

The RBI just bought a bunch of gold to try and show some stability to the rupee in India, its been unstable for 3 decades now. There is a reason everyone buys gold there and now bitcoin. 
Every South American currency is unstable. Look at the Real in Brazil or the Peso in Argentina. Plus Venezuela already has huge bitcoin adoption compared to "normal" countries. 
South African Rand isnt a good currency, the Mpesa system itself is more centralized bs the country could get rid of. 
Then the Ruble has that sanction issue along with Irans currency. The Lira isn't considered a good currency by the people looking at Turkeys issues the last few years. 
Pegging everything to the US dollar when that is just another printed currency is probably part of the problem. Its not fair to a lot of them having to be devalued based on politics though.

Bubbles burst and the stock market is NOT as valuable as it has been propped up to be after the chaos of avoiding a depression. Automation is about to crush the western job markets over the next decade as well.. 
It doesnt matter what nation puts Austrian econ into practice, people can still hold gold if they don't believe in bitcoin and its a GOOD hedge against the markets and currencies right now. 
This guys analysis of the world debt popping soon isn't some quack claiming bitcoin is solving world issues. He believes there are 4 possible scenarios: New asset class is introduced, gold standard, bitcoin standard or complete default of world debt. 
There aren't a lot of options when debt has been increasing 3X the the wealth added globally over a 20 year period.

What about the bitcoin credit cards? Wirex, AdvCash, Spectro, Shift, Bitpay etc... 
Not saying these are GOOD now... but they probably start competing on lower fee's and actually making it convenient to buy things for crypto holders. ABRA has that launch this year for using fiat to buy crypto, stocks or using crypto to buy stocks even... 
These are going to integrate with banking at some point, its just obvious.

Other currencies will want a chance at some point to store value without USD permission 
Even holders of USD realize how hard it is to use the actual currency. If you aren't using it exactly as the financial system has now demanded USD be used, its going to suck for you to have that currency. 
Its not a fight with USD and BTC its always been "every other currency" trying to show value with USD approval. The fact its the last to go before BTC dominance doesnt make it any better than the rest of the Fiat.

Its historically disputed like many things but the overvaluation, ease of access to loans (which allowed the central bankers to print more money with every new loan) is not disputed by anyone. 
This is an Austrian vs Keynesian argument so if you havent studied or just dont believe in those economic principles, there is no point arguing about the validity of bitcoin.

Ahhh good point, dont make up a number to just say things are possible.... 
The current line (argument) about bitcoin being worth $1m+ is that Western culture will do a reset within 2-5 years because the interest on the $300 trillion global debt will crush the financial system. 
We are going to see a reset, that does not mean bitcoin IS the answer and only possible solution but there will be only a few options when currencies are devalued to "store wealth" 
We cannot expect the EUR, GBP, USD to store value, with the stock market in a bubble 10 years after the housing crisis was patched by printing fiat currency. There are arguments whether its a housing bubble, stock bubble or both... and with which currencies will fall but currencies will definitely lose more value for holders of cash as time goes on. 
This is one of the more popular lines of thought right now, that there WILL be a change and why there will need to be a new asset class created or a gold standard, or a bitcoin standard. 
There is no avoiding economic problems over the next 10 years.... we kind of know that the economies everywhere are close to tapped. 
The international financial community will have a great new solution for everyone to feel safe and secure again....and there will be the cynical non-believers in bitcoin and gold that won't value whatever solution the banking cartels roll out. 
Currencies definitely have to decline in value though. The 08 crisis band-aid avoided a depression but caused a bigger problem down the road for the economies connected to that.

Pretty sure the answer is just to have a dump truck of cash on had and a dump truck of crypto for payouts of anything. 
The largest similar-not-crypto example of customer funds being held/owed I can think of is PokerStars being taken down be the DOJ a few years ago with Full Tilt Poker. 
There was the one site with enough money to pay players and buy their competitor out from under them while settling a government injunction. And there was the other site that didnt hold players funds properly, lost their business, have the worst reputation forever. 
THAT scandal is really the first centralized "exchange" (money for poker chips instead of crypto) getting taken down by governments, that didn't blow up in customers faces.

My friend and I built a site "shilling" bitcoin maximalism for that very reason

There is no "favorite" exchange because you have KYC/AML exchanges everywhere (tied to banking) and anonymous exchanges that people from every country will also want to find. THEN you have "other ways" in different places we never think about like meetups and merchants that take bitcoin. 
You are right that most of the "crypto" or bitcoin related sites have an agenda. The market will work itself out over time, people can only shill so many things before those sites are burned.

its mined by the central banks computers then sold to the people (pegged to main bitcoin chain) through the central banks? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:54:10
Not all blockchains are decentralized  
blockchain is just a digital ledger, that isnothing innovative... proof of work (part of the bitcoin protocol) and a decentralized store of value on a blockchain, providing the ability to transfer between two parties without the need for 3rd parties -- IS why bitcoin is valuable. 
You are valuing it as a "token" which is nothing. If it is bitcoin, it has been verified by the miners of bitcoin through "proof of work" to verify that the bitcoin mined by anyone IS a decentralized store of value. There is value in verifying a currency by the miners all trying to mine the currency... it is work that a central bank will NOT do or allow. 
We can not discuss the value of the currency without assuming the fact that the currency is only held within THAT bitcoin protocol, which is only built to be a secure, decentralized store of "value"
Bitcoin ISNT an investment it is DIGITAL MONEY for the INTERNET. 
A government cannot create the internet money because central banks will print dollars and inflate the value with the money supply and rate of inflation.... AND you cant have a national currency transfer through the internet without many rules and fees through the international banking system. 
Bitcoin removes all of those problems as a decentralized and verifiable store of value for everyone involved.

Its as unbiased as you will get about why bitcoin is one of five possible scenarios to drop the **317 trillion global debt** we only "subtly feel" right now. 
He is clear that a gold standard, a new asset basket or complete default on world debt are also possibilities....there is ZERO possibility the debt doesnt have to go away. People behind the scenes are obviously making moves now to "solve the problem" again. 
The interest on global debt will be too high in 5 years....and the 08 "quant easing" was a band aid to keep the 2nd great depression away...but the band aid keeps falling off in different countries now...

The inflation and debt printing has the global debt at $250 trillion now... at what point does society say "fuck this" and store value in something other than fiat...gold or bitcoin that aren't controlled by the money printers. 
The argument of a deflationary currency leading to people starving naked on the streets rather than spending money on food clothing and shelter isn't a solid argument for inflation. 
Enough people will agree they were taught that in school but actual proof of deflation stopping people from spending doesn't exist.

they are idiots...that isnt what bitcoin is for. 
Can I put $1 into BTC and pull that $1 out in Euro, GBP, CNY or any other "currency" worldwide if I want? Yes. 
I can probably do that with "semi-stability" over the next 30 days... to not lose or earn anything but to avoid Forex fees with exchanging money from one country to another.... 
Now, are there people around the world -- either sending money through the internet or storing money into a digital secured currency that can be "spent" anywhere or "sold" for a national currency will be valuable? People do this with USD or Gold, Paypal, Neteller, banks and now BTC with varying adoption and access to these "services"
Over time...people will probably not even exchange the bitcoin for these national currencies... look at the Real in Brazil or Peso in Argentina. Look at the Rupee in India and Indonesia currency problems.... 
There is a need for a global currency that no nation controls, for everyone to have an equal chance to use and spend it anywhere. That is the problem bitcoin solves for people with shit currency and capital flight laws. 
Over time more and more people realize this and adopt it and use it... THAT is why it has brought in speculators on price and valuations go all over the place....those stabilize for real over time with adoption...nobody cares now though... 
IT WILL NOT BE STOPPED...there is a social problem being a government leader that takes peoples "stuff" regardless of nationality... people will still hold the "stuff" in possession as more valuable than when you banned it. 
If you are a government leader in a country with an economy that has an inflated money supply (everywhere!!!!) then you do not want to rock the boat with people believing that currency is so undervalued you will go and BAN a digital decentralized currency like bitcoin.... 
bitcoin is its own feedback loop for adoption, security and stability as sound money over time... the problem is education, understanding and ignorance towards money globally will take time as this is adopted more.

If people buy gold with the state currency, the state has no control over that. 
If people buy bitcoin with the state currency, the state has no control over that either. 
Central bankers controlling the inflation and interest rates on the money people hold, means they have no control of the value (spending power) of their money.

Bitcoin is a protocol....like email. It also has currency in the bitcoin protocol ALSO called bitcoin... 
If I want to email you a dollar I cant do that for obvious reasons. In the bitcoin PROTOCOL, you store and transfer bitcoin securely without the need for intermediaries... THAT is the value. 
The bitcoin protocol is doing what the central banks do right now for people...without charging bank fee's every step of the way, having hidden inflation on the currency, having costs to exchange currency from USD to GBP then to AUD... it sends the value (bitcoin) between parties without needing a banker. 
If I can send $10,000,000,000 of "value" across the world in 10 minutes without needing a bank to help me.... just like an email...then THAT IS something of value that the central banking system wants to charge everyone fees for still. 
The bitcoin protocol is offering that service and it is a productive asset just like a company would be. The code disrupts the banking systems monopoly they have on everyone's money. The code allows people to "mine" a currency and miners verify that currency (bitcoin) is not fraudulent or being double spent. 
There are many layers to why bitcoin is valuable but DO NOT confuse the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin currency with a digital 1 or 0 that everything digital has.... its not even close.

You give them too much credit, they OWN AND CONTROL THE MONEY CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION
In addition to controlling the VALUE of that money. 
Why in the hell would a money printer want to create something that would be out of their control to manipulate and change the distribution of? 
The only thing the banks (and hedge funds) do in bitcoin is buy bitcoin, short it and sell their bitcoin position. That will continue for awhile because its a great short term play.
@_date: 2019-02-04 03:59:56
The ten years of trust and secure transfers (along with adoption rate over time) are part of the "value" new and old adopters of bitcoin see in it. 
Any blockchain starting with bitcoins code or a "better" code, still has to prove similar results over time to show value.

we should have pinned his lindy effect images (that was a  thread) to the front of r/bitcoin 
Like longer form discussions with actual analysis about the adoption over time or the Austrian vs Keynesian economics discussions, should stay longer than all the repost of crypto news items. 
There should almost be a "keep this thread going" button for users that is more than just an upvote... or weekly bi-monthly discussion on actual bitcoin adoption or education of bitcoin with all the tourists coming to this sub. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:19:39
Yeah its discussed in this thread already, there is a sentencing coming this year for the banks that rigged the gold rates the last few years on the market...jpmorgan and a few were doing that with gold because $$$. 
Bitcoin is a store of value that can't be seized, like gold was kept in a bag to flee a country if one needed back in the day. You can take that gold anywhere and sell it. You can take bitcoin anywhere and sell it. 
Stable price isn't what anyone looks at 10 years after new tech/completely new asset is invented and adoption over time is obv still questionable. 
IF bitcoin is what it is -- a store of wealth, that cant be seized (bank accounts, houses, stocks can all be seized) and can be sold anywhere in the world -- then the "digital gold" speculation that people buying it are doing would be correct. 
The buyer only needs to be able to sell bitcoin at higher than the Forex fee's our national currencies currently offer, for a "global digital" money to have "value" -- it does not need to increase in value by XXX% because forex fee's and others banks tack on are still being disrupted with this new money.  
IF there is a flaw in this tech (security, stability) or it is somehow not possible to be bought and sold anywhere in the world, then it starts to limit the actual use of it over time and then the "value" would have to drop. We all know that and it has been the risk from the start of all this.

The wires have fee's. They arent instant, have limitations on the amount we can send and foreign exchange fee's for international wires. 
Think of all the businesses around the world that send wires with these fee's daily that are being robbed by banks in fees. Then add on all the individuals that have put up with these costs to send money digitally...it adds up. 
Those fee's for banks to handle our money are what they want us to believe we need. It's their whole excuse to be around still...

No chance.. this is RULE 1 for anyone buying... The Canadian exchange that JUST filed for bankruptcy has threads full of people all saying the same thing...Nobody has sympathy for people who dont know to store your crypto properly, so dont cry about it. 
Everyone has trezor or ledger nano that own more than $500 or so  worth of crypto. They are both super cool and fairly foolproof for everyone. 
India, Asia and Africa are all using mobile app wallets, Samuria wallet or green address are fairly trusted as being secure. The security isn't as big of a deal in places without easy or cheap banking. 
Gold analogy continues if you consider all the 'buy gold for cash' stores around the world we see... as long as there is a buyer in the world, you can sell your item. Bitcoin has that through banking/legit means but also in many underground ways IF you really wanted to live off the grid anywhere in the world. 
Its not stopping anyone, just difficult/expensive for different use cases.

Totally agree, that one is a long shot if it ever were to be discussed by the muppets every country has for politicians...BUT it makes sense that a person and company cannot change where the consumption of "things" are happening.... 
You can move and you can register companies wherever you want... but the taxes for consumption would be high in certain places and lower in others... no more BS about registering companies here or how much income you earn for doing whatever... 
On the currencies mentioned above-  Venezuela for example is by the Peso in Argentina and Brazil's Real.... those arent stable currencies compared to holding USD, Gold or Bitcoin/Crypto now... 
Russia sanctions had them doing deals with Maduro and China because US controls who gets to play in US market. 
The people in those countries under sanction like Iran see that currency wars aren't fair to the people who hold the currencies and look for global wealth solutions like gold and now possibly bitcoin. 
Bitcoins "goal" has always been described as digital gold. Its just in a technological bubble currently and surrounded by a "get rich quick" scheme in the media. The protocol is the same $20k or $2k to send and store "value" without intermediaries messing about.

@_date: 2019-02-05 02:50:05
It actually reinforces the need to not rely on 3rd parties that make promises to customers when code can be written to remove these intermediaries. Bitcoin did nothing wrong, its still transferring between two parties without needing intermediaries. 
The people selling bitcoin and buying bitcoin are still able to lie about whether they will provide customers what they promise. 
The real scammers are central banks changing inflation and interest rates quarterly, decreasing the value of national currencies when "monetary policy" suggests they should do that... such crooks.

I think they're going to eventually adopt 2nd or 3rd layers like what LN is doing. Something that "works with" the main bitcoin blockchain but probably isnt bitcoin. 
For that, Im waiting at least 10 years because there SHOULD be a few options popping up with solutions how to use bitcoin either on chain or side chain.
The benefits over time are twofold for companies accepting bitcoin though: 
1. it should be a lot easier in future to account for payments that are already on a public blockchain like that, to prove what revenue and taxation comes from different currencies 
2. It is easier for businesses to avoid taxes if they accept bitcoin/crypto and "wash" the funds to run their business 
I expect small business to take advantage of option 2 and large businesses to want the benefits of option 1 which will create an argument over time about taxation of businesses and individuals EVERYWHERE 
But wtf do I know, I owned TRON once ffs...

Because poor people would get the same advantages the rich have had access to in the current global financial system. The irony is offshore money is being "stored" a lot cheaper not using the offshore banks connected to US, UK and European banks.... 
Maduros money for example, the DOJ already settled with his banker in Panama about his offshore money, should Venezuelans have paid tax in the country while they're being robbed? 
Its not just financial, ethical, philosophical and legal changes that are happening because of this.
To suggest that the current infrastructure revolving around the banking cartels needs to be kept in place, without the global financial system having to adapt to "sound money" being available for anyone, will only result in the fiat currencies dying quicker... 
Tax laws would probably amend to work around the fact people can store and transfer money without a national bank... people still consume things, it isnt like consumption tax couldnt increase everywhere to still provide for communities people are living in. 


Venezuela, Russia, Turkey, Iran all have currency issues. 
All of Africa. 
South America as a whole is terrible for paper money. 
People ARE using it because their currency doesnt hold value. Then there is China capital flight rules...people like having bitcoin and transfering it out of China or storing Yuan in bitcoin...

Proof of work for sound money on a national level? It would require mining and electricity for the country to have a "national bitcoin" using the same protocol. 
Current system = print money or add debt whenever central bankers need more money for government things 
Bitcoin system = spend lots of time/money and energy to mine the currency you plan to use, and have it verified by other miners that this thing is real. 
Nations could swap their bitcoin currency in and out of the main bitcoin blockchain for citizens. Its not a fork, its the same protocol, just starting from $0 and having a nations electricity behind that and the current bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:56:59
yeah if something has historically been a store of value for 6000 years then all of a sudden appears to be manipulated on the market, we know where to look for that problem...

Look at the investment options you have... 
Housing and the stock market are bubbles waiting to pop. 
The Pound, Euro and US dollar are overvalued from all the money printing since the housing crisis in 08. 
India, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Africa all have currencies that people DO NOT TRUST... 
Then there is the job market in western countries being a complete shit show for the next decade... 
How are people going to offset inflation when there is $300 trillion in global debt, that the interest will start crushing the western world very soon?

regular currency is fiat which is printed whenever the government tells the central bank to print more. 
This devalues the regular currency because the holders of it don't control the supply in any way. The hidden inflation decreases the value of these printed currencies over time. 
We want sound money.... bitcoin cant be faked or have more than 21 million. Currencies like the bolivar, Zimbabwe dollar, Ruble, Lira, rupee are over printed, devaluing everyone's wealth that holds the currency.

The entire monetary system is likely to change soon because of the $250 Trillion in global debt that will never be solved within the current framework. Central bankers are publicly saying to remove USD from the reserve currency peg, they wouldnt say that privately years ago. 
UBI wont make a difference if they are changing the way money works soon.

Satoshi has 500k coins and left the project in 2013 iirc 
For anyone just tuning in, that is worth $2.6 billion today. 
Imagine not moving your coins when bitcoin was worth 3x what it is today. 
He left the project and the bitcoin he owned years ago so that bitcoin could continue to grow.
EDIT: meant 500k not 500m, hence the math working out to account for 500k coins he apparently has.

A loan is not compatible to an asset or a currency (however you see bitcoin) 
1 USD equals 0.82 GBP, if I charge you 1,200 USD for 820 GBP, you would probably go down the street and get 940-960 GBP for the same amount. Especially with bitcoin purchases, people are going to check the price online before buying every time. 
Desperate people arent buying bitcoin to make rent or buy food like the payday loan scam.

That is a talking point for bitcoin haters. 
We aren't having any discussions about the world using less electricity for other things, or even comparing the amount of electricity bitcoin mining uses to anything else. 
The argument also assumes technology won't decrease the amount of electricity used over time to mine bitcoin. 
It avoids calculating ALL altcoins electricity use compared to bitcoin because real data is difficult to acquire.

The internet was built with an option for money that was later left out of the protocol...this has been discussed by people who were involved with http and the banking uproar about how money moves. 
Minimal adoption of bitcoin is over a million people now world wide... and consistent increase in security as blocks are solved. 
Add to that the education of people that the financial markets constantly being "fixed" by the ones who are directly or indirectly creating the problems, is going to wear very thin on society. 
Bitcoin isnt the solution but its nice to have a new tool outside of the banking system to store value. Banks create "products" to sell people that don't really store value, they add fee's to the banks pocket.

The first central bank that admits to owning bitcoin causes an issue for other central banks telling fiat holders (citizens) to "value" fiat when they're acquiring bitcoin.

"crypto" might not be my fav open and free market trading solution right now because of all the scams and fraud. However, that is where these markets are going 10 years from now. 
US stocks were propped up by housing bailout funds for a decade so the bankers could profit and this new open market that people who never traded can enter. Where does everyone want to go to make money... Not where the smart people requiring degrees and high fees to trade on their little platform are, that's for sure. 
I was only semi joking when I got into bitcoin that fiat was going to crash but Ive either drank too much kool aid or they really are going to have to peg currencies to something at some point.

For the record, Im holding for 10 years so dont care about price. Its semi-interesting to see calls and peoples thoughts on it when I want to buy more. I probably wont this year until we see the 5k range or if 10k is really stable.

This 8.5k jump was prob a fund of some sort that decided to buy right now

Ive seen 3/4th of Europe and 5 or 6 cities in France, nothing ever screamed shit hole like Marseille did to me
Apparently I need to go to Chicago to see if it is in fact the worst, no thanks

the dip was obv below 4k... waiters be haters yo
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:50:21
have you checked mycelium trader? I heard the app is decent and semi anon for cash trades - not 100% sure but its been around for ever and no big drama afaik
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:12:09
pretty common... 
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:57:21
well most of us knew that part, the 100k thing is really interesting though

I'll take "useless shit nobody wants" for $400

it's like a boner entering cold water some days, bitcoin price has a mind of its own
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:41:46
It happened in 2016 actually
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:40:05
You spelled thinking wrong :/
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:53:15
might be a better place to ask this 
friends covering the anon exchanges and "bank connected" exchanges in every country 
Just for options avail. However I think Hodlhodl is blocking US customers. I would personally go to a meetup and pay cash or use mycelium app, possibly work for bitcoin. 
Everyone has different preferences for buying and selling it obv, nothing seems perfect yet for everyone.

Why cut down trees to put phrases on cards when we all use our phones for things like this ?
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:25:34
Holders of last resort will still probably ask if the holding would be profitable long term (ie. is the protocol broken) or not...
Trace Mayer is one of the oldest and he bought in a $0.05 so not a lot of worries until it's down to the $100 area for him.

that sold bitcoin or farted at an orgy? The answer is no to both. ALWAYS.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:02:32
Parents can buy and value gold, they probably wont believe that bitcoin replicates those principles digitally, so dont try.
Their kids are going to buy and value bitcoin because understanding it when learning about other asset classes (and the creation of money), makes complete sense to under 30s. Maybe not to ALL under 30s but education over time.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:53:56
watching the price, whats the tldw on it?
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:00:39
And back to 7k in 6 weeks? We dont need another end of 2017 this year or next. 
Some of us are fine with it sitting at 6k for 12-24 months because the only money in btc, isnt supposed to come out at all for 10 years
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:39:13
That was 2017 and many assume Bcashers were spamming the chain. There was also a change made so it would cost exponentially more to spam the chain like that in the future.

Offer him $20 to call it off early. You save $80 at least. 
You wont see $50k for two years and that would probably be another bubble to crash scenario most of us dont really want.

Im not your search engine, it was discussed already at length awhile ago

You get any of the debit cards that use BTC to buy things in fiat and quickly realize "Im selling my bitcoin at a shitty rate here" because of their fees. 
You should go to beginners bitcoin sub and clarify what you actually want to do with bitcoin or why the card matters. 
Bitcoin on chain transfers work for most of us that want to send $100+ across the world in less than an hour and hodl the rest. Drink that kool aid and you will never come back to the dark side of fiat.
