If I were to do a 2000 satoshi transaction using this API, what would the transaction fee be?
I think I read the first 8000 transactions are free, but I mean afterwards.
lets say I'd like to have a 20 bit "item" that can be purchased, but what would i charge the user so that they can pay exactly 20 bits while the miners fee is still covered?  
Would I just receive lets say 15 bits, and use the 5 bits for the miners fee? (user just sees 20 bits) I want to keep the miner fee hidden from the end-user.

how do miners get rewarded with their bitcoin if they don't have an address to begin with?
is one created for them? do they get a private key with the btc on it?
lets say I'm a solo miner and i discover a block on my own, how do i know i received it and where is it collected?

if you create a cold storage wallet , how do you fund it without broadcasting to the network that BTC was sent to your newly created address?
