FEEL FREE NOT TO PAY YOUR TAXES. The government doesn't have enough resources to go after everyone so they need to instill fear to make sure you obey.

Praise to our new found overlords, the miners and businesses.

You will get what was owned to you at that time.  
It seems they're either overloaded or up to no good lately, with the amount of anti bitcoin shilling the owner has shown lately I vote for the later.

I can understand that this is your point of view but its based on emotions and an arbitrarily chosen number.
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:55:31
It will get harder but don't get too attached on owning 1BTC, any amount will be ok.

The fact that you can still run 0.13.0 is proof that no consensus rule was changed.

Electrum configured to use tor proxy.  
Theres more to it than using a wallet so know what you are doing.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:40:28
Does not sound like marketing at all.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:42:42
That will incentive sybill attacks so no. But you can run an electrum server or joinmarket bot on the side if  you want to get some bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:11:52
No you can't. See bcash.

Somewhat in the same boat except my transaction says it failed on their side and they blame it on transaction malleability, however my txid shows as confirmed and they didn't return the money either, I need to chase them.

This blockstream conspiracy is getting really old.  
No single company can dictate the evolution of Bitcoin as otherwise it would be already worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:25:20
Some disagree @_date: 2017-08-08 20:15:39
They why not let it to the developers to solve this technical problem ?  
It is clear that you think more is better but its not how it works.You will be able to pay for your coffee using Bitcoin once LN takes of.

Making the block size bigger doesn't make us more resistant to spam attacks, quite the contrary.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:32:33
Nodes do not decide what transactions are included in a block but decide what transactions they accept.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:48:39
Theres no risk as long as you're willing to go through all the KYC/AML requirements. Coinbase has been pulling shit like this since forever and they're even more legit than shapeshift
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:56:53
There is no reason to believe that this happened in any significant number, we certainly do not see it in the number of transactions.

Who is this "we" and how to you promise to change something you have no control over ?
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:19:48
Its true that everyday users prefer the easiest choices and maybe someday Bitcoin will get there,  
but its not on the top of priorities list, changing a number will not increase Bitcoin's adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:16:28
It depends who is "they" and what you want to use this for. If its for darknet markets you need to do a bit more tumbling before using it.
