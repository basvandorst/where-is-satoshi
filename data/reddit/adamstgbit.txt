i wonder if that actually the case. depends how the reorg'er processes the reorg. miners could be cool and not consider mempool TX while reorg'ing.
still i wonder if a regor EVER caused a 1conf payment to lose its 1conf after the reorg.

clearly when BU copies core's edits, they kinda roll all the committees of the day or week into one commit....

OPS, we were all blindly fallowing Bitcoin Jesus, turns out he's wrong. OK active segwit now.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:09:08
I respect your opinion that segwit is "best" and i almost agree with it. I mean... i strongly believe that a TX malleability fix to allow LN and all that, will be absolutely nessary, I trust core has sorted out all the technical details, but i also believe and prioritize blocksize, i dislike any solution which proposes a fixed incress ( this includes segwits block"weight" ) because it doesn't allow for a optimal fee market. IMO BU is the only viable option to solving blocksize issue. emergent consensus is a new(ish) term, but the concept is as old as bitcoin, and in the end its the only thing that matters, some 95% or 75% threshold or whatever, has no real weight, when push comes to shove a few lines of code edits and 51% backing is all that stands in the way of changing bitcoin, we can not stop the freemarket by refusing to provide code...  saying "my way or the highway" is no longer convincing anyone because, that isn't the reality of the situation, and this is becoming more true day by day.

@_date: 2017-02-01 14:46:39
agreeded, this is indeed why 1conf is &lt; 4conf &lt; 100conf 
Your formula expresses a worst case assuming 100% of miners are "not cool". which might be the case today! who knows how the regor code handles it...  if it's not already the case, i guess we could have a non-fork BIP "opt-in cool reorg"
It's probably possible that "cool reorging" is made into a block validity conesus rule, but thats probably taking this non-issue to far...
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:12:11

@_date: 2017-03-13 23:04:01
it would be easy to detect this kind of insane-scenario-double-spend.
also, miners could simply choose not to include TX that conflict cross chains.
also worth noting your sanrio breaks down if miners aren't attempting to push a block size which a large % is not prepared to accept.
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:28:19
dose core have node binaries with this code in it yet?
when can we expect to see signaling for the USAF start?
 
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:54:27
nodes can view this cross chain double spend as any other double spend attempt no need for proof of anything other than proof of your TX is clearly a double spend attempt.
miners can do what they like, if they want to ignore double spend attacks, thats fine, i'm just suggesting some miners might want to avoid including conflicting TX.
@_date: 2017-01-28 06:37:09
you can hash your file (whatever file) and put that hash on the blockchain.
now you have a timestamped immutable proof that this file you own is authentic and hasn't been altered. + the hash has been signed.
you send the file to someone he hashes it and compares that hash to the hash on the blockchain.
this kind of thing will become automated and easy for anyone to do.

its wrong to think that just because the change is a softfork it cannot cause a chain split, after all once segwit is adopted poeple will chose to fork off, we are not bound by the node software we previously chose to run...
@_date: 2017-01-29 04:15:27
Including the hash as part of a signed BTC TX is what i meant by putting it on the blockchain, is there anyother way of "putting it on the blockchain" ?
It can be used to authentic files, I could sign the hash of the original bitcoin white paper pdf  and put that on the blockchain, then if someone downloads "the original bitcoin white paper pdf" from some site, they can check its hash Vs the hash on the blockchain to validate that it is in fact the original. ( i mean provided we all agree the hash on the blockchain does correspond to the original )

while "effective block size" will Eventually get a 1.7X incress, the strain on the node's resources to support this incress will more than double.
segwit provides an "ineffective block size incress".

@_date: 2016-12-19 01:46:18
this has been cores strongest weapon, "TODAY we have bla that has been well tested and ready! just do it."
yesterday it was RBF, today its segwit tomorrow its LN, the day after that bitcoin is a settlement layer where highly complex million dollar channels are opened and closed every ten minutes, while we are told that bitstamps LN channel will block payments to wikileaks. but thats ok because anyone can be a LN node anyone.
... I would like to be given the opportunity to see and feel LN before i hand over all the blockspace to it.
@_date: 2016-12-10 23:28:37
your just mad about how easily dismissed this attack really is.
@_date: 2016-12-10 06:26:09
the bottom line.
any attack which requires miners to act a way as to harm the network is a weak argument...
we have pools that represent hashing power.... its a bit of a stretch to say anyone one minner pool will ack maliciously and be able to maintain hashing power % for very long.
and 90% of these "maliciously miner attacks" are expensive and can only really cause temporary disruption... in the end.
kudos on the guy that first pointed out this vulnerability you describe. glad its a known and fixed issue.
bottom line.
BU is a viable option. BU is safe impl of bitcoin. BU is very much in the spirit of bitcoin, free and open, BU is the best way we have to hand off the very important blocksize issue we are faced with to the free market.
miners make for very good keepers of the blockchain, it is their purpose, they will not incress block size endlessly recklessly. and they will not wast attacking the network, for temporary disruption..
Its good we code in such a way that eliminate as many attack vectors as possible.
and we do.
BU is a fine bitcoin client to run...
remember when segwit forked the network?
segwit is fucking top code too. 
i want segwit!
but. right this second. i want BU more...
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:31:12
Open source is the ultimate free choice, but if core didnt write it, its garbage. LOL the irony in your post is fucking wonderful  
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:18:01
its unrealistic that miners would preform this attack.
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:08:02
Letting miners decide the block size is like letting banks decide on interest rates.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:04:47
altho valid, this is an unrealistic concern.
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:03:32
I think i might start saying segwit will *decrease* in onchain TX throughput because the blockchain will be mostly filled with open and close channel TX.
@_date: 2016-12-18 04:43:34
no i'm recommending block size increases Via BU's emergent consensus, and a simpler fix to TX malleability, one which does not involve changing blocksizelimit to blockweightlimit + arbitrary discounts on TX signatures. i dont care if its impossible, JUST DO IT! lol.
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:16:28

malleability fix is the only thing which I like about segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:27:25
that sounds goooood too, i guess i meant to say the only thing i dislike is the blockweight/sig discount/small amount of wasted space in TX, things.
 but i do believe the quadratic hashing fix, Signatureless IBD, Script Upgrade functionality, is a by product of their malleability fix(segwit)

@_date: 2017-07-21 19:11:23
my concern is that once the orphaning of non-signaling blocks starts, every time a non-signaling block is produced, many non-mining-nodes might see this block as valid, untill miners produce the next valid block.
this would mean that 1-2 confirmation might not be very reliable, so long as there is a miner that is producing these invalid non-signaling blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:51:15
segwit2x(1/2) is a softfork tho. hance this sublet behavior described above
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:34:54

@_date: 2017-07-19 01:29:41


that IS the very root of the issue nullc points to here. it matters...
and i'm trying to point out that even if that issue is avoided ( which it easily will be) there is another issue to watch out for, for the nodes. 
you can try to pretend none of this matter's, or you can take the time to understand how this upcoming upgrade will impact the network as a whole.
which is that, as this thing gets activated / adopted, we cannot trust 1-2 confirmermations.

for second layer to actually service any meaningful amount of TX/Sec the core blocksize will need to be bumped.( to like 100's of MB to service alot of tx/sec)
so the better question is why are some so hesitant to such a small incress, when much lager increases are inevitable?  
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:35:35
this situation of nodes constantly re-converging onto the btc1 chain will continue so long as &lt;100% of the miners are signaling appropriately.

@_date: 2017-07-19 15:30:11
if purely driven by profitability, then there will most certainly be SOME hash power diverted to the ABC chain. Miners will have to choose between be 2% of bitcoin hash power or 20% of ABC...
and long term it could very well be that since the ABC chain allows for bigger blocks the fee+minning reward will be gr8ter then bitcoin's.
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:07:17
they dont, and clearly neither do 90% of miners... it seems there is no single force with the ability to "control" bitcoin. this fact doesn't stop them from trying.
but maybe, if the "2x" part is avoided, then you'll find that you are on a chain in which 90% hashing power clearly has no influence. is this desirable?

not sure, but i'm going with, yes! ( so long as most choose to fallow &gt;90% of the minning nodes )
some seem to think BIP91 signaling is just "BIP91" but really at this point people signaling BIP91 ( with version bit4 set ) are actually signaling the use of segwit2x software, which (correct me if i'm wrong) has a HF baked into it ~3 months after segwit activities.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:38:28


segway has been canceled?
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:10:50
I would think that all the non-bit1 nodes on the network will see non-bit91 blocks as valid still, so every time a miner makes a block that gets orphen by bit1-nodes,  non-bit1 nodes will consider it valid untill bit1-nodes extent there chain.
is this why exchanges are halting BTC TX for a while?
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:51:53

Assuming the btc1 nodes all connect to eachother properly and avoid this bug.
does this means that as segwit2x activates, the non-btc1 (more or less every single node on the network) nodes might fallow an invalid chain for a while?

of course since majority of miners run one thing while all the non-mining nodes run somthing else, this causes subtle issues that are being discussed in this thread.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:38:05
i think its not so much a move to save face as it is a move to keep a significant % of economically relevent actors on the same chain. getting one scaling solution approved over an other, isn't worth losing some 20-50% of the bitcoin community.
with segwit2x, segwit fans cant fork away ( they are getting what they want! ) and with 2x its harder for big blockers to fork to abc since they have been promised a  BS incress soon after.
this segwit2x was designed to avoid splitting the two camps on august 1st.

@_date: 2017-07-19 19:03:21

they have  no real control because anyone can simply become an exchange to service the demand and make lots of profit doing so.
