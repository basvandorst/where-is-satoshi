How much did you pay for the coins originally?
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:50:17
Hadn't used the site before so I checked it out. It seemed wrong but I think it's only telling you your total gain, not the amount of taxes you'll owe on that gain. I think the tax rate on short term capital gains is 35% so your tax burden for that purchase would be about $25
*Not a CPA and have no tax background, don't take any of this as tax advice obviously.

Are you going out of your way to not understand the concept that over any extended period of time you are going to get the same amount of coins regardless of where you point your hashing power (ignoring pool fees)?
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:16:09
They own a lot of the mining power themselves and sell it on an exchange, they then get fees from people trading on that exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-15 00:48:55
I thought there were fees but I just checked and there aren't. Looks like the only fees they charge are on mining done with their hardware, [details found here](

I'm well aware, I've used it before. But you sound like you think it matters where you point your hashing power, it doesn't. Your reward over time will be the exact same regardless of how often any one pool finds blocks.

Technically it's not deflationary yet...
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:34:11
Right you're talking about it's buying power while I'm talking about the monetary base. It's deflationary because of an increase in popularity (both from speculation and increased trade) which will have an upper bound. 
I was referring to people who say that bitcoin can't (as in because of the technology) work as a currency because it's deflationary they are referring to the point when mining new coins stops and the monetary base stops increasing, a point which we aren't even close to.

I'm still a little confused. What actually shows up on the blockchain because it sounds like A sends payment to K and then B can transfer the funds from K to whatever address he wants. Am I missing something here or is the point of this just to make to harder to track transactions through the blockchain rather than impossible?
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:00:21
Thanks for taking the time to walk me through this!
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:21:11
Okay then this is very interesting! So what shows up on the blockchain transaction?
@_date: 2014-01-14 17:13:56
nevermind, you're a troll
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:45:08
Do you have equal hashing power on each?
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:41:36
That would be pretty cool, walk into WU and have coins loaded onto your flashdrive wallet, or pay an extra fee and have them give you a card or drive with a wallet on it. They could push systems that let you do in store sales with BTC by swiping a card just like credit or debit, and have kiosks in malls where you can load coins on the go.

I don't know why you were down voted, average is a pretty vague term and I wasn't really clear as to what average I meant at all. I was referring to the average price for the time period of a given candlestick. If I were you I would just take the midpoint of the candlestick, it wouldn't be the true mean but it should be sufficient for this analysis.

I'm still curious how they're going to monetize it without alienating their userbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:27:14
Oh so basically a Coinbase alternative?
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:48:05
Okay cool, maybe I'll play with the data later
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:54:33
What happens if you plot candle height as a percentage of the average price over time?

Whenever you start trading anything you have to define your risk aversion, How much loss potential you are willing to accept in exchange for profit potential. It sounds like you have a large disparity between your actual risk aversion and the monetary value that you claim to be okay losing. If you were really okay with your portfolio dropping to 150k then you wouldn't be complaining to us right now. 
It sounds like you have pretty much zero risk aversion, so without a serious expertise in day trading volatile securities you shouldn't be doing it. Either say you don't mind losing half your current value and keep doing what you're doing, say you think Bitcoin will increase in the long term and hold onto it for years, or say you can't afford to lose money and head over to r/personalfinance and see how you can get on track.

Thanks that helps, cryptology is very interesting stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:31:53
I think I have a pretty good grasp of what bitcoin is but on the more technical side could you explain the public and private keys. So is there one public key that is just part of the protocol? Are private keys generated with each new address? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:32:51
It might, it might not. Where did you get your raw data from out of curiosity? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:12:51
Maybe it's because I've never used Western Union, but I'm not seeing how they could possibly use Bitcoin to their advantage? There's a physical reason why it's hard to send cash to someone but what benefit could WU have over just sending money from one BTC account to another?
