Absolutely true they could have been taken for thousands of BTC.
However, with a daily volume of 20k BTC and assuming a 0.5% commission on every transaction, they are netting approximately 200 BTC per day in commissions.
So unless the hackers have stolen at least 100k BTC, I don't see how they would become insolvent over this.  They have been hit hard for sure, but I don't think it's game over.

There's already a thread on bitcointalk about this exact idea:  trading "Gox BTC" for "real BTC".  
The way it works is both users need a Gox account, and you can apparently successfully transfer from a Gox account to another Gox account using the BTC "deposit" address.  This does an internal (off the blockchain) transfer.  Then the real BTC are done on the blockchain.
I don't know what the current spread is, but the other day is was between (0.6-0.9 Gox BTC) / 1 BTC.
EDIT: Here's the thread:

Or option 3:  dollar cost average.  Buy some every day, for the next few days/weeks, starting now.

That makes me want to run so far from BTC it's not even funny.

If you live in a decent-sized city, you might be able to trade cash for BTC in person.

MtGox starts at 0.6%, and gives discounts based on number of trades.
This used to be reasonable as people were buying coins for $50.  Now each coin costs a minimum of $25 per trade.
BTC China currently has zero trade fees and allows you to transfer/withdraw in BTC.  This may be just a temporary discount, but they have used this to jump into the  BTC exchange.
I personally have not yet used them, so I don't have firsthand experience.

BTC China takes a commission on deposits/withdrawals.  I hope they just add a flat trade fee on top of this.
The issue with a percentage "rake" system like MtGox is that you get much lower volume and much lower liquidity because most day traders.  The only way they can stay afloat is to put up $10+ bid/ask spreads to offset this huge transaction cost.
MtGox is trading around 30k coins per day.  They are taking both sides of each coin transacted, and at $1000 per coin and a minimum of 0.25% each side, that means they are raking $150k per day.  If you assume 0.4% average, that's $240k per day.
Another option is to make the "market" side of the transaction pay the fee, while the "limit" side is free.  This is also reasonable.

They need to cut their ridiculous exchange [transaction fees](  Even taking 0.25% of both sides of the transaction is a massive ripoff, and has the side effect of people demanding $10-$15 bid/ask spreads.
