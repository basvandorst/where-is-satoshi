You are a normie. You came here after it already blew up. You really don't have any knowledge to offer.

You would be celebrating if btc had a **real** crash? I'm not talking about the recent price fall in the last month. That was nothing, most of us knew it would happen a good bit before it did.
The likelihood of a rebound if btc went back to dollars would be incredibly low. The normies would never buy after that, and we need them to jack up the price and make us a profit. 
I'm not saying a real crash is likely to happen, I'm just saying if it does you wouldn't be as happy as you think.

I'd imagine everyone would be hating if btc regresses by over a year of building.

The font difference is interesting, but I'd assume it's a phone thing

Why don't you tell us what you think it means when BTC jumps from 16 to 20 and back in 5 minutes. 
We are saying there is no information to gain from that, it is meaningless. On the large scale BTC is far from impossible to predict. Some people in this sub have had great track records in predicting dips.

That's not a crash. Not a real crash at least. BTC had averaged 16k between the last two days. Every day has a few k spikes, they are to be ignored in the larger scope. 
Over the past 2 weeks we have seen a 6-7k spurt. This is not stable. You can't extract a singe day's BTC average and assume stability. That's not how this  works. 
Expect a 8k drop within then next week. Then buy more, and a steady increase will follow.

That's the point, there was no "sudden decline", they are microcorrections. These are projections, and the results have been varying by the thousands. You said you saw BTC go as high as 20k today, all of my resources claim it topped just under 18.5. A friend told me Google claimed it was at 19 while every other service said 16. 
This happens every day, the numbers are just larger lately. 


You **have** to ignore them if you plan to buy low and sell high. They mean nothing when it comes to tall earnings, other than *try* not too buy on a 2 minute "spike".


They really should though, if you are buying. We've known a real and very large crash is due soon. If you aren't thinking about these things you may be in for a bad time. 
As I said before, the crash is nothing to fear, I just want these fine people to prosper as much as they can.

I'm afraid you really don't know enough about btc if you haven't been able to follow along so far. Bitcoin and most other cryptos don't have the same lifecycle as other investments, that's why you seldom find actual investment terms here. To be honest, I would expect a really 'savy' investor to completely avoid btc in fear. 
I have to strongly advice other users to ignore your advice. I'm sure you have good intentions, but you've made too many baseless assumptions to be taken seriously. No insults intended, I've just been buying btc a long time and I can tell you haven't.
I hope you come to understand what we've been trying to explain to you, and I wish you luck with your btc ventures.
