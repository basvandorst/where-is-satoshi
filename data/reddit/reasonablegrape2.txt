Did they charge you for the ACH deposit? Looking on their site, it's a $5 fee... to put money in to the account so they can make money charging you fees on trading. 
No other exchange does that.

Late, but my answer would be not to use Kraken. Use one of the many other options to buy BTC other that actually seem to want to do business with US customers.

If you want to use Monero, why bother with an exchange that takes KYC in the first place? FixedFloat, MorphToken, tons of other options out there if what you want is XMR.

Gold. Pure gold.


Came in here to say this. If it were me, this seems the most reasonable approach. Chances are whatever you give them would either be lost, forgotten, or sold for cash within a year. 
This way you can give them whatever they actually want, but also help them out in 5-10 years from now.

At that rate, why wouldn't they just stay on that other exchange? If they make Fiat deposits easier, with lower deposit fees, seems like a no-brainer to me.

Recipients need to perform full KYC (name, address, phone, birthday, age) in order to receive it... not really worth it for a lot of people (depending on gift size).
