I don't think every single transaction should be broadcast onchain, I don't think this is wise infact I would go as far as to say that is a completely ridiculous idea, but to be fair I still want to be able to buy a coffee with bitcoin if I choose to do so, this is where I hope LN (and if need be other 2ndlayer solutions) come into the picture for me.

There's only one bitcoin, and only 21millions bitcoins. 
Anything else is a alt coin. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:10:54
It's an altcoin created from the Bitcoin Blockchain just like others have done, the only difference is it copied the transaction history of bitcoin prior to August 1st 2017, but is a completely different coin. 
See the sticky post on the top of r/bitcoin for more info.

It tells me the pot is bubbling, I expect a correction/ dip before $4k, the longer the rally continues I imagine the larger the correction, I don't think we will ever see below $2800 again though. 
But then again, my magic crystal ball could be on the fritz. 
Either way, a dip is coming, and the newbs will begin to panic sell as usual.

There is nothing to suggest we won't see another correction, what you said is nothing but your opinion lol, yes it's true coins are limited now, but it will only take one wave of bad press to cause the price tumbling down all the beginners getting in now will panic sell at the drop of the hat, I don't know what will trigger it, but it's a lot more likely to happen that us going up in a straight line forever from this point onwards. 
And a correction is **nothing to fear**, I imagine (and this is now only my opinion, so magic crystal ball numbers) we get to somewhere like $8-9k then crash down to $4-5k, and this will be our new floor, is absolutely nothing wrong with something like this happening considering we were less than $1k less than 12 months ago. 
**Telling people not to expect a correction will only cause them to panic sell faster once a correction does happen cause instead of knowing and expecting it's only a correction they will now think bitcoins failed, just like in 2013/14.**

Can't go wrong with averaging out over time but there is no real answer to be honest.

I know your intentions are in the right place, but I think we should work under the assumptions that posts like these are from newbies, (OP may not be but I mean these sort of posts in general) and recommending a paper wallet to these guys I don't think is good practice, sure it's one of the most effective ways to secure your bitcoin, but if you want to talk practicality *and* effectiveness, a good Hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor should be our first recommendations. 
I'd sooner recommend my friends mom leave her coins with Coinbase before recommending she print her self a paper wallet for her to secure her $$$$. 
*disclaimer, I always recommend a hardware wallet or alternative and never recommend exchanges (such as Coinbase) as a secure way of keeping bitcoin safe, I'm just trying to make the point that there may be a disconnect with an older person understanding the bitcoin are safe on this piece of paper, let's assume that every new OP is someone's mom and recommend the easiest but also the most practical route to safe storage* 
Edit: oh and congrats OP.

Well at least your diversified I guess. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:08:35
No man, a drop like that would be totally [normal]( for Bitcoin. 
Are you new here? 
Edit: just want to point out, incase anyone misses the satire, Bitcoin always sees new ATH's then crashes/corrects, but the price never falls below the previous, so the price dropping from $4k to low $3k would not be anything dire, hell even if the price fell to $2k I wouldn't be worried. 
Like I said though, I expect low to mid $3k, which would be sweet for a correction. 
And who knows maybe the rally isn't finished, maybe we see $10k first, but please don't be naive and believe bitcoin cannot loose 25% of its value tomorrow, it happens. (hope I don't sound patronising here, not trying to be)

Don't panic sell, don't try to time the market, don't buy or sell on emotion. This is how you hodl.

@_date: 2017-08-15 00:04:03
Why is everyone so afraid of a pull back/correction? If you make posts like this and let people believe we will continue to climb up in a straight line, when the dip finally does come, all these beginners deluded by ideas of bitcoin going to 1million tomorrow with no pull backs along the way will panic sell come correction time. 
If you hodl bitcoin, your in it for the long term, not short term gain and not worried about dips/crashes/corrections because you know it never falls below previous ATH, and you know better that to look at 24hr price charts. 
[Some pleasant satire to illustrate my point](

Most other coins out there are direct forks of bitcoin, take Litecoin for a example, it's bitcoin with a different logo and different name and different attributes. 
The only difference with these altcoins and the fork worries over the last couple weeks such as BCH is that they are giving everyone who holds bitcoin one of their tokens too, it's still an altcoin. 
Also not everyone will claim these coins, yeah mostly everyone that follows bitcoin on places such as reddit will claim them, but reddit doesn't account of everyone that uses bitcoin, my friends mom for example isn't going to go out of her way to try and split her coins to receive forkcoin, there are not nearly as many people willing (or people that even know) to go out their way for any forkcoin as u may be lead to believe, which is why there was so much uproar with the shinanigans BitPay tried to pull off the other day, they would in effect cause a lot of parties that have no idea what's going on to loose a lot of money. 
They are coins on two different chains.

When it comes to crypto currencies, I find it best to follow the combination of tech and value, right now bitcoin is and always has been the most valuable crypto, and in *my* opinion, has the most potential out of all the other altcoins, this includes BCash. 
That being said, I do think some altcoins will have a place in the future, however not many, most will dwindle away.

Instead of converting back to Fiat, head over to a site like, **overstock.com** and treat yourself *(they accept bitcoin directly)* and sell a wide variety of goods. 
Alternatively you can get a bitcoin debit card such as the,**Wirex Bitcoin debit card** which you can use to spend bitcoin a almost *anywhere*. 
Edit: Spending bitcoin directly at sites like overstock.com helps the community, it let's merchants know bitcoin is being used and encourages adoption, so if you were gonna buy that laptop anyways, why not spend your coins and replace when you can, or even just spend to celebrate some gains, it doesn't have to be a lot.

It wouldn't happen over night, but once the big exchanges make the change, the rest will likely follow suit after some time.

It's funny, everyone says "I wish I bought when bitcoin was less than $10" or whatever, or "I used to have bitcoin back in 2010 but I lost them, I could have been rich" but truth is, the vast majority of those people would have sold at $100, $500, $1000, etc etc, even today, 10 years from now people will be saying "I used to have some bitcoin back in 2017 but I sold when it got to $10k, man I could have been rich"

Its not possible, most a government could do is say is bitcoin is banned, but they won't because people will use it anyways, look how many times bitcoins apparently been banned in China for example. 
There isn't any central location or any bitcoin ceo (even though some falsely claim to be) so there isn't anything or anyone to shut down. 
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, it would take some technical reason for bitcoin to disappear not any government.

If Btc hits $1million next week, why sell? Lol, you would be selling to get Fiat to just spend it anyways, cut out the middle man and just spend your bitcoin, you can already do so today if you really wanted to. 
If I *needed* Fiat specifically, sure I would *convert* holdings into the amount of Fiat I needed for whatever specific reason, but I wouldn't wake up to 1 million and first thought sell, no way, if it hits $5k it can hit $10k if it hits 10k it can hit 50k so on and so forth, so you see, theres no right price too sell, I'm not saying keep all your Eggs in 1 basket, but looking at bitcoin as a Payment system, a Store of value *and* a currency is important to remember, why sell it when you can spend it.

And would rather not buy than buy a "Fraction"? 
I know this is very ignorant but unfortunately there are many many people outside of the community that see it this way.

The funny thing is, when the correction does happen, and it will eventually, all these same dudes waiting for the dip will be like "Ahh well, it's crashing, guess bitcoins failed" and not buy, then it will break another ATH, then they will buy at like $10k, then it corrects again, "oh noo, why is it crashing! Let me ask reddit why the price has gone down $300") *panic selling begins*) then we reach yet another ATH, and the same dudes that sold on the last dip buy back even higher. 
I can only imagine how many people are buying right now that sold on the dip a few weeks ago.

A bitcoiner needs help and you turn him away? You know if you hodl bitcoin before yesterday, you have BCash too right? Maybe he wants to know how to split the coins on the Ledger to sell his BCash for Bitcoin, who knows, whatever the reason and whatever your feelings towards the other chain is, it doesn't cost you anything to help someone out, especially a newbie bitcoiner.

@_date: 2017-08-01 19:43:38
I also don't think it's over, even with another chain with increased block size, I bet the other sub still continues to complain about core and blockstream conspiracies. 
When I first found bitcoin, I subbed to both subs, one sub posted mostly development news and spoke about bitcoin overcoming Fiat systems, and the other was filled with top posts about censorship and blockstream etc, one sub is still the same to this day years later, the other sub mostly posts memes all day but at least there's some great development news every now and then that actually gets up votes. 
I do hope we can all move forward now.

**Research into Hardware Wallets, Ledger Nano S or The Trezor are very good ones.**
With hardware wallets, even if you loose the device or if it's stolen, your bitcoin are still safe, even if your computer has malware your bitcoin are still safe with hardware wallets. 
Coinbase is probably the most beginner friendly exchange but it isn't the best in the world either, having said that, using Coinbase is fine, just remember the golden rule of bitcoin *"if you don't control the private keys, it's not your bitcoin"* 
Once you buy your bitcoin (from anywhere) be sure to send them to a wallet **you** and only you control. 
Edit: also, to answer your questions, yes if you leave your bitcoin with a 3rd party, any 3rd party, and they are hacked or they go out of bitcoins, yes likely your bitcoin are gone, but this is why you must control the wallet, Bitcoin itself cannot be hacked, so as long as you take correct measure your bitcoin are safe forever. That being said, a company such as Coinbase is insured against them loosing your coins, but still.

And these are supposed to be bitcoiners? They finally have their big blocks, but guess what, the drama never ends, the economic majority prefer Bitcoin (core) over BCash but that is not good enough for them, the price shot up right after they forked off and left, years of fighting for this and yet here they are. The same people that believe shapeshifting lizards are running blockstream. 
Give me a break. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:10:19
But BCash is barely a week old, also the "nickname" BCash (well that chain as a whole tbh) has some political friction around it, a better example would be the confusion over BCC vs BCH.
Either way there's a lot less politics involved when we are talking about switching from whole Bitcoin to bits.

1. If for example you buy your bitcoin on Coinbase, the bitcoin will be in a wallet held by Coinbase that you have access too, you can move these coins to your own wallet, and spend them whenever you want. They don't send you a code, just the bitcoin. 
2. If you get a hardware wallet, when you first activate the device you will be required to write down a passphrase, usually 12 or 24 words I believe, this passphrase is generated on the device, you write it down and you keep THAT safe, that is the lock and key to any bitcoin you keep on the wallet. 
Once your passphrase is safe, even if you loose the hardware wallet or something happens to it you can always recover your bitcoin using your passphrase. 
On the devices you also set up a secondary password usually being 4-8 digits long, this is what you use to send bitcoin from the device. 
Very easy, very secure.

People are trying to orchestrate it as a problem now, Bitcoin has constantly been attacked for the last 9 years and this year is no different, personally I think it's a good think, it highlights bitcoins biggest weakness; people. 
And big hardware operators are trying to cheat the system and cash in on forks right now, but this won't be possible long term, the larger bitcoin grows the more resilient it becomes, let's use Mt.Gox and 2013/14 as an example, back when Gox happened the price tanked all the way down to the low $200s from $1200 everyone yelled "Bitcoins dead! Bitcoins Been hacked!", if the same exact thing was to happen to am exchange today we would barely notice it (look at what happened to  BTC-E just the other day, deferent scenario but still resulting in the loss of a lot of bitcoin). 
Events like what we are seeing today will more than likely be a non-issue in 3~5 years. 
We have to remember bitcoin is still a baby, everyone overlooks this and expects bitcoin to end world poverty today, it needs time to mature, we need events like these so we know how to react in the future, Bitcoin is still maturing, we're still experiencing growing pains, we have more crashes yet to come, we have more attacks yet to come, we have more takeover attempts yet to come, but it all allows bitcoin to grow stronger. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:16:12
The price could tank Tomorrow, that doesn't mean it's time to start ringing up the tulips, remember 2013 from $1200 ATH to $200 and we've recovered and then some since then, I don't ever expect to see &lt;$1200 again but if it were to tank that doesn't mean it's over. 
They thought it was over in 2013 too. 
Anyways, I'm optimistic as always, $5k by the end of this year, if not Q1 next year, $10k not long from there.

Yes, but once you write down your recovery seed, all you now need to do is secure that one thing, you can lock that away for years never having to use it, all the while still being able to make transactions freely. 
Sending from a paper wallet involves the physical paperwallet, the whole thing is quite convoluted really and especially for someone new to bitcoin *also* If we bring up friends mom again, she can easily relate to "this is the password(passphrase) **to your money** keep this bit of paper safe", rather than "this piece of paper with random numbers and letters and a QR code **is your money**", keep it safe. 
Point is hardware wallet + seed is less friction for new users.

Why? I don't understand this narrative, how many extra layers do you think you are operating on right now to be able to connect to the Internet and use reddit? 
How about your mobile phone? How many layers do you think your phone is using right now? Bitcoin is like a smart phone, but it seems you only want to be able to make phones calls and send texts with it, feel free to buy a phone from the 80s or the 90s and see how that works for you, or maybe you would like to check out that dial up Internet connection I used to use 20 years back when if my house phone rang it would disconnect my Internet. 
Satoshi himself suggested we would need 2nd layers, broadcasting every single transaction on the blockchain is just ridiculous, do you think coffees are all the blockchain will be used for? Machines will be using the blockchain too, possibly transacting hundreds of thousands of times a second simply increasing the blocksize doesn't allow for this so easily, think outside the box (or shall I say think outside the *blocks*), even besides this, I don't want the world knowing exactly what time and date and I was at Starbucks, or what charities I like to donate too. 
It doesn't *need* layer 2/3, *just*, to function, Bitcoin was always supposed to be able to enable apps on top of it, it is **Programmable Money** after all.

**SUPPORT OVERSTOCK.COM** When the price rises, and you have gains, celebrate by treating yourself to something on overstock, it doesn't have to be alot, you can spend even just $10, and once you do that, if you want you cam replace the bitcoin you spent by buying $20 worth of bitcoin. 
Also check out "Spendabit" there are literally millions of things you can buy with bitcoin. 
Instead of exchanging your bitcoin back to Fiat paper money to take profits or for whatever reason only to just spend that money anyways, you may as well cut out the middle man and spend the bitcoin!! Once you have bitcoin there is little reason to exchange back to any other currency unless you are a day trader. 
Support the network by spending your bitcoin, Hodl 80% spend 20%.

Many ways are very convoluted for beginners, stuff like paper wallets etc, all to me should not be advice given to beginners. Get either a **Ledger Nano S** or a **Trezor** these are the best and more importantly the *most secure* way a beginner can safely store his/her bitcoin, they are called *Hardware wallets* there are a few on the market but Imo these two are the best. 
Even if you loose the device or if it's stolen, your bitcoins are still safe, furthermore, even if your computer has malware on it, with a hardware wallet your bitcoin are still safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:23:55
Bitcoins are definitely being used as a currency, otherwise merchants wouldn't waste time accepting them, take overstock.com for example, they've recently doubled down on bitcoin by deciding to keep 50% of bitcoins spent with them instead of converting to Fiat, the company is holding. 
Also, companies like BitPay would not be in business if they (bitcoin) were not being used.
Some people even receive their entire salary in bitcoin via Bitwage. 
You also have debit card services such as Xapo and WireX, these allow people to spend their bitcoins using a debit card, almost anywhere, yeah sure you can make the argument that these debit cards are technically selling your coins and paying the merchant in local currency instantly, but the simple fact that people use these services so much shows that people are out there not only willing to spend their coins, but are actively trying to spend them too.

You will mainly only see memes poking fun at BCH, and you will see trolls on both subs. 
When I first found bitcoin and subbed to both subs, I got a very "tin foil hat" feeling from r/Btc 
Another thing I noticed over there, post anything bitcoin related but unrelated to fees or transactions or block size, and somehow the discussion always ends up digressing; "core is evil, blockstream runs core and the evil banksters run blockstream, Zomg! Zensorship!!" 
Having said that, this sub is no walk in the part either.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but even if all bitcoins were lost but 1, that 1 last bitcoin could still be divided amongst everyone. And when I say everyone I mean all 7 billion of us. 
But I could be way off and misunderstand the divisibility of a single bitcoin but I think we can further divide bitcoins into smaller units than a Satoshi if we needed to. 1 satoshi (or Sat) is currently the smallest unit of account in bitcoin.

Bitcoins been around for 8 years now and it's gone up in value year after year, salute to all those who saw its potential early on and were brave enough to take on the risk (or stupid enough, either way you look at it, it's better than our current wealth distribution, could have been better, yes, but definitely better than what we have now)

They will sooner try to control bitcoin that ban it or attempt to shut it down.

Regardless of him being a fraud or not, we know the power plays he has tried to make in the past to gain control of BTC, it's fair to assume given the opportunity he would not pass up controlling its alternative so can you take such accusations lightly? It's still the perfect example of a bad actor trying to control a decentralised project.

Looking at the 1 year chart I would argue that this rally actually started from around $1300 (*only 5 months ago!!*) , people quickly forget it was only 12 months ago to this date bitcoin was only **$600!**
It could drop a little more, yeah, but we still in the green, imo it could fall to as low as $1300 and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.
Honeybadger doesn't care, neither do I.
These pull backs are healthy Imo, nothing goes up in a straight line, from $600 only a year ago, $1300 only a *few months* ago all the way to just shy of $5k, I can only imagine what the next cycle will bring.

OK, so Alice mugs bob for $100 of bitcoin, Alice then buys a T-shirt for $100 from some online seller that is on the other side of the county that has no idea that Alice is a thief, now the seller should have Bitcoin worth less than the $100 he thought sold his shirt for? Worse yet, the seller decides to deposit his new bitcoin into Coinbase for reasons, Now Coinbase bans this seller for handling stolen bitcoin and he is also put on a Blacklist and can never buy/sell/spend bitcoin again?
Take out your wallet, how many coins or Notes do you think have been involved in some sort of criminal activity, such as theft? I'm willing to bet all if not most of them, should your notes be worth less? Because they were handled by criminals in the past?
Fiat Notes are involved in funding crime on a world wide scale far far larger than Bitcoin is.

Just download Mycelium, or Samurai or Breadwallet or something, when he arrives for the sale, u open up your wallet, he scans the QR code and sends you your coin, which all in all takes about 5 or 10 seconds.
**Me Personally** I'd have him send payment with a priority fee, and once I'd receive 1 maybe two (judging the situation) conformations I'd be out the door, that being said anything less than $30 I wouldn't stick around for even 1 conformation.

When I first joined the sub some years ago, it was all about technology and little about price.
The more popular bitcoin becomes, more this sub becomes obsessed over the price (fresh moon kids), the more it makes bitcoin look less serious Imo, it encourages the false ideas that people have that Bitcoin is a ponzi.
The technology is more important than the price, **a lot more important.**
Although I also get carried away with the euphoria that rollercoaster memes and the like bring (it is fun after all To the moon and beyond!) but really and truly I don't imagine this is the place for it, I don't even think r/bitcoinmarkets is, astronauts should have their own sub, which would be cool.

And afaik people were claiming they would take legal action to them was *before* they released the Coinbase statement.
Taking legal action over fraud isn't crying to the government, like the parent comment said, if I go to buy something and the seller intentionally sells me something different am I supposed to just sit with my balls in hand?
You may as well have titled this thread "No Snitching" because I don't think anyone's arguing the companies should take on B2X if they so wish, but if one day I have BTC and the next day I try to withdraw but can only withdraw B2X, there's a problem.

Eth is much younger, also not as big as Bitcoin. 
Eth split but most of the general public won't ever know there are two ethereums. 
Btc splits, it's a media disaster, public perception of it will only worsen, and you can bet your last Btc that it would be a misinformation shit storm, both chains suffer. 
Let's also remember were comparing gas to gold, sure people speculate with eth and some even use it as a currency, but eth doesn't have the label of being digital gold.

Bitcoin is a self fulfilling prophecy, it will be a store of value, it will be digital gold, it will be accepted as a form of payment worldwide, all those crazy price predictions will bear fruit. All will come true because they can, the door was opened in 2008 it's now worth multiple billions. 
$1Trillion market cap day will be a day of celebration. 
Halving parties will become widespread. 
There will be novelty pizza shops that exclusively accept bitcoin. 
Banks will hodl too. 
Settlements will be taken care of by the bitcoin Blockchain. 
Amazon will accept bitcoin LN payments. 
We will have Banks/Coinbase-style hybrids 
Blockchain technology will be taught in schools. 
Once we reach somewhere between $10-50k we will transition from Bitcoin being the primary unit of value to "Bits", Satoshis will be also shortened (Sats) 
The price will rapidly increase over the next decade, then slow but continue to climb. 
Bitcoin will continue to act as the reserve currency for altcoins. 
There will be alot more bitcoin TV advertisers. 
More exchanges will be hacked. 
Jihan will continue to Jihan.

Splitting hairs here, I'll reword, we are at a point in time closer to Segwit than we have ever been before and the chances of getting Segwit by this point seem incredibly Likely. 
This isn't the point of my comment, even if Segwit doesn't get activated my point still stands, name calling helps nothing and it makes the community look bad, I in no way support Bitcash and think Ver is wrong on this one but he has a right to his opinion and I have a right to mine. 
I'm not saying theres anything wrong with challenging his views by the way, challenge away, further more I would expect nothing less, but hateful speech (on both sides) is a poison for bitcoin.

Quite a few snobbish responses so let me give you my two pennies. 
Firstly, Id never reveal how much BTC you own to the Internet, even if its only a small amount, that's my personal opinion though. 
Secondly, no matter what exchange it is whether Coinbase, Gemini or whoever, it's never a good idea to leave your bitcoin with a 3rd party, the general rule of thumb is if you don't control the private keys, then it's not your bitcoin, so transfer them to a wallet you control. 
Copay &amp; Mycelium are very good hot (mobile) wallets, Copay is a little more user friendly I think. 
If you ever get more than a $100 worth, or even if you plan to exchange from Fiat to Bitcoin regularly, it's a good idea to invest in a Hardware wallet, such as the Ledger Nano S, you don't want to keep large amounts of BTC on your phone, a hardware wallet Imo is the best way to secure them for the long term. 
Also, hit the gym and work on those biceps, you'll need a strong arm for the volatility ahead, don't let your emotions get the better of you and don't panic sell, just take a look at the posts over the last couple days of all those people who panic sold when the price fell a little last week and now look where we are, always keep in mind volatility is dropping as Bitcoin matures, the price will go up, the price will go down, but if you look at any chart and look at the all time price history, you'll notice it's paid off to hodl and the price is "crashing" upwards :)

Check any price history chart, and zoom out, it always falls, this is nothing new lol, where were u last week when it fell and all the noobs panic sold then the price shot back up like a few days later lol. 
Yeah the price falls sometimes, but check any all time chart, it's falling upwards. 
Buy the dips and don't let emotions get in the way. 
I learned this the hard way. You only loose money when you sell, if you bought 1 Bitcoin for $100 and the price drops you still have one bitcoin, if you bought 1 Bitcoin for $100 and the price drops to $50 and you sell, you loose $50 and 1 Bitcoin, then the price goes back up as usual, now you buy 1 Bitcoin again, this time for $150. 
Edit: when checking the all time price chart, notice it never "crashes" below its previous all time high, this is the key here, knowing this is knowing the reason it drops at any giving time isn't really that important. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:15:13

Bitcoin has just about all those things, but we have seen many bubbles form and pop over the years, this one will be no different, at least not for any of the reasons above. 
You could just as well read off a list of things that would cause it to pop, if Satoshis coins were to move today; pop! I don't personally believe those coins will ever move its just one of many things that could cause this bubble to pop, if Coinbase was hacked; pop!

I really want to be as optimistic as you are, but I can't deny that it's worrying, but to be fair your right everyone who has Btc now will have coins on both chains after the fork.

Wether he's right or wrong, I don't believe he is intentionally trying to cause harm (I can't say the same for Jihan as something tells me he's manipulating a lot of situations for financial gain), I think he genuinely believes what he's doing is for the greater good of bitcoin (even if in reality it's the opposite), because of this I believe we should hold off on personal attacks towards his person. 
We have Segwit now, let's start talking about the exciting things yet to come. 
If he wants to fork, it's in his right to do so as with everyone else, it shouldn't matter, BitCash will be an altcoin like the 900 others only difference being BTC hodlers gets free BitCash. 
(reading some of the YouTube comments, and a few here actually, reminds me of the r/btc comments personally attacking individual core devs, it really isn't attractive, Id hesitate telling any newbies to check out either reddit sub in fear of the top post not being about bitcoin directly but being a personal attack completely unrelated to actual protocol development) 
In reality it was a combination of videos by Ver and Andreas that got me infected with the bitcoin bug, and I'll forever thank the both of them for it, I know I'm not the only one here that was convinced by one of these two, and even though I don't agree with his opinions on the progress of BTC, both of these two have done a lot to help change the public image of bitcoin from being more than just "nerd money" or "a money used by drug dealers and criminals".

If you still have that Bitcoin next week, however now the exchange rate has changed and due to volatility 1 Bitcoin now cost $3000, that Bitcoin you bought last week is still worth 1 Bitcoin but is also now appreciated in dollar terms, it is too worth $3000.
If you get exited and decide to sell at $3000 you've now sold that same bitcoin you bought for $2000 at a profit, or you decide to exchange your 1 Bitcoin for an altcoin, yeah lets go with that, 
you take your bitcoin (still worth 3000) and trade it for $3000 worth of navcoin or joeycoin or govcoin or whatever useless coin gets advertised to you (not all alts are bad) you now have $3000 dollars worth of that altcoin, but next month bitcoin jumps from $3000 to $10,000, you still only have $3000 worth a shitcoin lol meaning you could still only buy $3000 worth of bitcoin, so you would get like 30000bits or something at that price not 1 whole Bitcoin. (unless the alt your hypothetically holding also fluctuates in price) 
Moral of the story, don't bet against bitcoin, not long term Anyways.
Not keeping all your eggs in one basket is also a good one, but in saying that, you also have to be careful not to buy in shitty scam coins.

I don't really see how wright could possibly get away with trying to convince the world that he's Satoshi, the language alone would show to the world he's a fraud, this isn't the first time he's spoken in such a way and I don't even mean the cursing alone, Wright to me seems very rude and condescending just pretty obnoxious really, there's no way some of that wouldn't have bled through into his posts if he was in fact Mr. Nakamoto.

It will be a Homophone like many others (like "bits"). 
It certainly won't be commonly referred to as "Sotoshis" that will forever be it's proper name and the name used by bitcoiners, but Alice and Bob will use Sats or some other shortened term.

I think you may have missed what he was referring lol

Come on guys, everyone is allowed their opinion, even if you believe they're wrong, feel free to try and convince him otherwise, but I see a lot of comments going at his character. 
Its not so long ago every vinny post on here were full of people calling him the bitcoin Oracle lol, it's like since his last prediction was incorrect he's treated like an outsider, when in fact most people have an opinion on what they think the price is going to be on X date.

No more

OK I think I didn't explain correctly I'm talking about merchants that accept bitcoin as a payment, but using **NFC  payments** similar to apple pay but with bitcoin so no Fiat involved, as in I tap my phone on whatever bitcoin POS system they have installed and the requested bitcoin amount leaves my bitcoin wallet and is sent directly to the merchants wallet, all without me having to open the app.
I know what lightning offers, I just mean NFC payments. I imagine if NFC payments were possible it would have to use lightning anyways, but I want to know if NFC it self is possible with bitcoin.
