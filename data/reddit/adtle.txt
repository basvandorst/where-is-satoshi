Do you have any evidence to support what you just said? I could easily write some post explaining how your post it's part of Russia's plan to undermine the US government and decentralised currencies like Bitcoin... So please back up your theory with proof.


You don't have to be that smart to understand that if you make 10 dollars and spend 15, you'll be in debt.
If you look at the yearly budget and then check the revenues, you'll quickly see that a lot of debt is being created. So this comment alone makes me believe that you have some idea in your head and ignore all evidence... which is sad.
I'll wait for proof of what you just wrote though.

He *is* a criminal. He created a platform and made money from what was sold there. He was not a saint, so you can't expect everyone to have empathy and feel sorry for him.
With this said... "double life sentence plus 40 years" is too much for operating that website and they should do a new trial.

Individuals, investors, banks, countries, etc, lend money to countries. Then the country that received the money have to pay it back on an agreed date (can be months or years) with a certain amount of interest. This interest depends on the "loan" duration, how your economy is doing, the risk of that country defaulting on that loan, etc. For example, Greece will have to pay more in interest than Germany, because they are closer to bankruptcy than Germany.
Who owns most of the US debt? Maybe this wiki page can give you an idea:
You'll see that some foreigner governments on that list ("Foreign holdings (...) As of 2018, the largest holders were China, Japan, Ireland, and Brazil"). Some countries do this because it just a good and safe investment, others (eg: China) do it because if the US is forced to make cuts, there'll be less consumption and if the US economy slows down, every thing slows down. Everyone is interested in maintaining the wheel going.
So... tl;dr: Who profits off the debt? Anyone that invests (aka lends money) on US debt.

Was it just cannabis though?
