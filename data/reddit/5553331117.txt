No, you see, we only need gov regulation when things aren’t going the way we want them to. Since bitcoin price went down we need government to help us keep it up. That’s the very ethos of bitcoin. /s lol

That's the reality right now but neither you, nor I knows the actual future of cryptocurrency. We are all speculating. It's uncharted territory. To say with such certainty the governments can stop it is also speculation. 
It could go one of two ways. That's the fun in speculating. 
The backlash if they tried to ban cryptocurrencies would be as silly as the political conversation of them trying to ban encryption.
Adapt or die, this goes for government as well.

I agree this quote is stupid, but the difference between using a paper wallet (in the way you do it with scripts and things) and using a hardware wallet is pretty obvious... it's simply easier.
We have to make bitcoin easier and more secure for the layman or else it will never take off. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:07:47
It could also crash the worst it has since the gox crash, and there are so many catalysts to pop this bubble (scaling, bitfinex, a community in disarray, new people who see the price and will get cold hands as soon as the price falls)
But yes, keep your horse blinders on. It's going to be ��
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:51:13
This much growth in such a short amount of time, not to mention the protocol itself hasn't introduced anything mind blowing. Yes I'd say in its current form it is overvalued.

You weren't around in the early days when people were clamoring for a hardware wallet solution because everyone was getting coins stolen. Some people don't want to use a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:43:14
The reason the price hit that was due to mt gox's false order books and blocking withdraws from their website.
Not unlike what is happening at bitfinex right this second.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:07:54
Yeah it's pure convenience. If you can afford to have one it is a lot easier than loading up a live cd on a non networked computer and blah blah, just to transfer some coins. With Trevor, it's plug it in, open browser, paste address, send, follow prompts on Trevor (2 button presses) and done.

There was resistance to segwit as soon as it was introduced as an idea. It's not false, I witnessed the in-fighting on both and before I had even heard of ASICBOOST.

Money is coming in from both sides to make sure bitcoin fails. Don't succumb to the divide and conquer bullshit. Both big blocks and Segwit would advance bitcoin RIGHT NOW. Yet everyone is being stubborn and too proud to compromise.

And by that logic the original post is equally disingenuous. Thank you for helping point that out.
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:34:31
In its current state it is overpriced. If we could put one of the MANY scaling solutions into place it would then be underpriced. But until then. The way it is working now with full blocks and 1.50 fee transactions. It's overvalued. When it was 500 I could send bitcoins with fees int the .10-30 cent range.
Not to mention if you're moving larger amounts.
It's almost on par with western union in which case why use bitcoin at all? 
I know why to use bitcoin, but some one who doesn't know the ins and outs of bitcoin do not so they see no reason to use it in its current form.
Do you see where I am coming from at least a little bit?
Edit: it's fun to think everything is alright because the price is skyrocketing but I've been around for quite a few bubbles now and I see a carbon copy of one happening right now.

I'm a neutral bystander who just wants bitcoin to succeed is all. This is not a very friendly community I can see though. The information on that website and the attitude in this sub make bitcoin seem unattractive. But that's just my opinion.
I still value the utility of the protocol no matter how it goes forward.
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:29:56
We have to cater to the dumbest idiot for mass adoption to happen. This is a mentality that is foreign to many crypto projects.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:11:11
Yes, blockchain technology is mindblowing, however bitcoin isn't the only blockchain, and there are others out there trying implement features and functions that bitcoin will never have. You should be worried about this if you're a bitcoin maximalist. 
But bitcoin needs to be refined and will lose out and become obsolete if it doesn't bring anything new to the to the table that improves bitcoin. it's currently stagnant like it has been since the silly blocksize debate started 2 years ago.
The biggest thing bitcoin has is name recognition, other than that it's the biggest dinosaur of blockchain tech.
Not to say it isn't brilliant. But right now it only really works well as a proof of concept for other more robust blockchains. Unless they figure out a way to make bitcoin more feature-full and robust, as well as be able to implement it with "consensus."
Sorry but I think the wrong people are now running bitcoin into the ground in the name of ego. On both sides of the blocksize debate.
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:28:18
At one point everyone was claiming bitcoin was all speculation, and judging by the rapid increase in price over the last few months I'd say all cryptocurrencies are all still speculation.

My sides. How funny. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:43:52
People saying things like this probably bought bitcoin at one of it's all time highs.
Never listen to the advice of someone to not look into and research new emerging technologies. If nothing else you'll gain knowledge of the whole crypto ecosystem that is starting to be created. It's an amazing thing to watch and unfold.
People like to think bitcoin is the end all be all, but that will never be the case as many people have many different needs and people have created technology to fill these needs.
Not to mention some of the extremely clever ideas some people come up with to utilize the block chain and distributed ledger technology.

Because he wasn'tCIA. If you saw before, the CIA contacted Gavin not he other way around.
After his visit there Idk what was discussed or if he decided to do malicious things to bitcoin.
I do find it weird this stuff if popping up today so much when Gavin going to the CIA has been common knowledge since 2010.

I know but it's complicated and a lot of people seem to think it changes bitcoin too much.
Segwit calls for bigger blocks for its increased functionality. You say Segwit is ready and tested right?
Well then by extension, nothing more than a blocksize increase would also be just as okay since it  is also ready and tested?

Okay. Say he was. Do you honestly think satoshi would have hand picked the sleeper guy to be his successor? Out of all the people working on bitcoin back then, he picks the only dude who is apparently a "sleeper" for the CIA?
Give me a break. Unless even satoshi was CIA? 
Either way it doesn't matter. The idea of cryptocurrency is alive and well and already giving people more power over their life's.
If bitcoin fails because Gavin Anderson is CIA, there are plenty of other implementations of cryptocurrency people can still use. Why stay on a coin that is backed by the CIA, allegedly.
This is all silly finger pointing shit going on though.
The idea can still be publicly improved, regardless of anyone's background.

@_date: 2017-05-03 16:49:29
I don't necessarily think that is the case. 
Someone had to step up when satoshi left. Gavin at the time was a worthy successor having contributed to bitcoin as much as he has at the time.
I think it's odd the very fact that he was contacted and visited the CIA doesn't really mean shit.
For all we know the dev team now is FULL of sleepers.  How would we know? Maybe Gavin don't want to play ball and CIA created block stream to hijack bitcoin development.
I don't know or care. I just want cryptocurrency to prevail. I'm tired of all of the bullshit finger pointing.
