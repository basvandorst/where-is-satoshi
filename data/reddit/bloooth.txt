Is Sylvester Stalone suppose to be gold?

This is priceless, thanks for posting.

I thought this article was well reasoned and it got me thinking about the long term viability of Bitcoin.  What would happen if Bitcoin is widely adopted and something catastrophic happens?  Who or what could step in and offer relief if it remains decentralized?

Show me that hash!

I have a remarkably similar story.  Wife, banker/investor friend etc..all were against me buying Bitcoin...
This morning that same banker/investor friend sent me a text "Hey, long time no talk!  I thought of you last night when I was talking about Bitcoin.  I should have listened to you.  What are your thoughts about Eteherium?"

I just posted this in another thread, but it's more relevant here. I woke up to this text in the morning.  
 "Hey, long time no talk! I thought of you last night when I was talking about Bitcoin. I should have listened to you. What are your thoughts about Eteherium?"

Isn't it concerning that it fell out of the channel and then backtested it and seems to be going down again?
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:05:41
Thanks for the suggestion, I think you're right about him knowing others in the same position.
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:57:13
So for the improvement is that they have hope.
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:37:00
Thank you for the help, I'll pass the info along.
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:00:32
Truth be told I wasn't sure what to recommend to him so I shared my experience of bitcoin which involves coinbase.  I did refer him to bitcoin reddit and I'll share with him the information I learned this thread.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:51:23
This just means it can be manipulated easily...has nothing to do with my greed/jealousy
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:11:04
What is the best way to stay on top of news like this?  Do the Bitcoin devs post their activities somewhere besides Reddit? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:56:46
I'd prefer a single person wouldn't have that option.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:52:55
the exchanges wouldn't keep them all their bitcoin on one address.  where did you get that from?
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:45:23
As far as I can tell, the obvious interior motive would be avoiding lightning transactions.  Without going into any detail, lightning transactions can essentially negate the need for exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:55:52
This seems unlikely.  They have enough money to buy in at almost any price.  I think they'd prefer it just died and went away.  It seems more likely to me that they just don't care enough about bitcoin and say uninformed things because that's what they are..uninformed.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:32:57
I wonder who you're really angry at.  You don't understand my position, I never said it's not fair.  Your assumption on why I posted this is way-way off.  Re-read what I wrote without the lense of anger and see if it appears different.  On top of that, your above argument agrees with I said about distribution. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:07:23
Yes, it appears I am.  I'm very surprised they do this, I figured for security reasons they'd break them up into small chunks.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:41:14
the main issue is replay protection.  aside from that it gets technical in regard to transaction speed.  One prefers bigger blocks while the other prefers lightning network.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:40:06
Yes you get an equal amount of segwit 2x..however..the issue with segwit 2x is that there is no replay protections..which means if you use it, it will negate your bitcoin legacy coins.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:36:30
through a different exchange.  Gemini, bitfinex are two decent ones.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:42:34
They don't have phone support.  Several people have emailed them and I would encourage you to do the same if you have an account there.  It sure feels like stealing, especially because of the silence from their end.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:12:06
I think the distribution was set at the very beginning.  4 years ago was not far enough back.

This would be so damaging to the newer users who went to coinbase for ease of use.  What a disgrace, I'm angry.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:16:02
Yes.  Coins were mined at a much faster rate in the beginning.  Satoshi has about 1 million coins from what I've read.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:35:22
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:46:21
Yep, this would be pretty nuts for people in the US because GDAX is by far the biggest exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:21:02
Finally, someone understands.
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:12:58
I had also been feeling this way, but we are about 1 month away and there hasn't been any communication about it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:13:51
right, but bitcoin is being sold as this alternative to fiat and it's walking from the frying pan into the fryer.  
Whatever, I'm still going to hodl, but this was more imbalanced than I was aware of.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:37:50
this point is unclear.  so far it seems legal, but it could create lawsuits against coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:38:32
Move your coins to a hardware or paper wallet.  There are numerous youtube videos on how to do that.
