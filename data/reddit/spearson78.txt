I created an arduino based paper wallet printer just over a year ago.
In the end the arduino was just too slow so I had to switch to an arm chip for the final self contained prototype.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:30:29
But due to the lack of Replay Protection they are making it impossible for users to specify on which chain they are trying to spend.

I wasn't able to pay using the eclair lightning wallet on Android.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:02:12
Where's the proof? No need for these unsubstantiated claims.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:21:31
Why would I ever roll back my own full node. I would never accept a block containing this transaction in the same way I would never accept a block containing a double spend or more than the allowed new coins are generated. This argument is nonsense.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:58:16
AFAIK already opened Lightning payment channels will however continue to function unless you try to close them.

Where's the proof? No need for these unsubstantiated claims.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:58:41
It's a little tricky to configure. You need a bitcoind and an eclair lightning node and my custom MineCraft Mod.

RBF is opt in.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:58:14
Close the channel before the split. This can even be done with an uncooperative peer.

One wallet down. Just need to get the rest to perform similar Block chain gymnastics now. /s

Just doing my part to dispel the Lightning "Vaporware" myth.
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:15:00
It's just a proof of concept at the moment. If there is enough interest I can package it as a Mod. Unfortunately it needs a lot of tricky config to setup the Lightning node and the communication with Minecraft.
@_date: 2015-03-02 07:56:18
I built my own  based on dot matrix printing a couple of years ago.
There wasn't enough interest at the time to bring it to market,

This also applies to all bitcoin clients that manage any kind of wallet for for you not just paper wallets.
Whats to stop bitcoin-qt from generating keys using an algorithmn known only to the developers?
We trust bitcoin software because it is developed as open source and any one can review the code and check that it is fit for purpose.
The truly paranoid can then compile their own client from source and be sure that the code they read is the code they are executing.
I propose the same for paper wallet generators.
The hardware and software must be open source.
There must be a way for end users to both 
- verify the hardware is exactly as published.
- verify the software is exactly as published.
If all these criteria are met then whats the difference between trusting bitcoin-qt and a hardware/software paper wallet generator?
@_date: 2013-07-23 14:40:35
There's a demo of an earlier prototype here.
It was linked in the description.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:44:54
That's not a sound effect its really a dot matrix printer in there ;)
From here though things can only improve.
My next steps are to
1. Try out faster chips.
3. Try out PCB manufacture with the current board.
3. Figure out how to mount the printer to allow ribbon changes.
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:13:40
If you want to see one on your desk pledge and make it real :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:24:22
Parts are ~$50. With the effort for construction it should be possible to hit a $90-$100 price point.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:10:45
And I want to sell them :)
I'm trying to gauge the level of interest and the acceptable price range. I'm currently looking at ~€45 in parts. The constrction process is currently ad-hoc and "fiddly" so my gut feeling would be €80 - €90 for a completed device.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:28:49
Long term archival is one of the primary reasons I rejected thermal printers early in the design process.
The printer is quite flexible in terms of the paper it accepts. Ihaven't given much thought to the ink yet.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:35:39
I'm heading in this direction.
Here's a demo of my latest prototype.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:26:40
Its based on avalanche noise and has been tested against the DieHarder suite. Bitfrore also continuously runs a statistical test on the RNG. There's more information in the earlier blog posts.

What's so scary my disembodied hand or my voice?
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:48:58
Its just an off the shelf box with a couple of slots and holes crudely drilled into it.
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:42:55
They're not quite as skillful as I would hope it took me ages to get that damn board out of the box %-)
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:05:03
Certainly solves the doubts/concerns about random number generation :)
@_date: 2013-08-04 22:22:01
The only attempt to do this to my knowledge isdocumented here.
They achiieved 72% recognition of English text after training however this result relies on the patterns of  word usage in English.
Their approach would not work for a random private key as there are no patterns that can be used to correct any errors.
@_date: 2013-05-11 21:35:37
I'm a strong believer that trust and respect must be earned. 
My plan is to be as open as possible and to provide a device that is auditable so that it can be verified by 3rd parties.
There's a long way to go to get there though :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:55:02
Congrats however I'm afraid there was no honey in the pot.
But this printer has been used to generate other notes with bitcoins stored on them.
If there is a problem in the random number generator this 1 private key might be the key to unlocking my savings.
Please try to steal my bitcoins :)
I want to turn this into a product so it needs to stand up against real world scrutiny.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:51:33
Will you be providing the full instructions to build an installation image.
How do we know the kernel hasn't been modified or any malware hasn't been pre-installed?
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:41:50
You can store a paper wallet in a bank vault or hide them under your mattress.
No need to worry about viruses, keyloggers or malware stealing your coins.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:03:52
My hardware paper wallet printer allows you to create malware proof paper wallets without the complexity of using a linux live cd.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:15:36
I would own the software that talks USB. I could make it return any hash I liked. You have to use tools provided by the chip manufacturer as I can't influence them.
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:53:51
You'll be able to buy high quality pre cut pre printed blanks from me or print and cut your own.
The printer uses a cheap ERC-09B Ribbon (~€3) which will need changing periodically.

My bitcoin paper wallet printer offers a malware proof way to print paper wallets. 
I'm currently running an crowd funding campaign to bring it to the market.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:19:07
I had trouble positioning a jig so I thought what the hell and went for it.
It can only get neater from here :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:31:15
I picked the number of bits based on how long I was willing to wait for them to generate. It needs to be high enough to enable some testing but low enough that you don't get annoyed by waiting.
I can't guarantee the individual bits have never been used before but I'm very sure they haven't turned up in the exact same sequence :)
@_date: 2013-05-17 10:50:28
I have couple of questions about security. I hope you don't take offence as these same questions were raised to me about my paper wallet printer project.
How can we be sure the device doesn't generate private keys according to an algorthimn that is known to you?
What is the source of entropy used when signing a transaction/generating private keys.
But congratulations on building this it looks like a great project.
How much would such a device cost?
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:53:54
Which particular limitations concern you?
Do you have any suggestions on how to overcome this limitations?
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:22:50
I'm trying to stay in the cheap embeddable microcontroller world.
As it stands the components should cost less than €15 each for a production run of 100.
How small/cheap can a rasppberry pi get?

Nice to see some more activity in the paper wallet area.
Here's my prototype for a wallet printer.
I'm afraid I didn't have any wood effect paper to wrap it in :)
I agree with the concerns about thermal printing so I'm currently experimenting with the epson m-190 printer.
Its dot matrix so I have a good feeling about the longevity of its print outs.
In my opinion $120 seems a bit steep. I'm aiming for $50 for a small run of 100.
I look forward to seeing this develop.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:22:12
The printer is an EPSON-M190 printer mechanism as used in receipt printers.
It uses ERC-09 printer ribbons.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:35:09
My dev board includes an in circuit programming port and I think it would help to build trust to include one in the final product.
@_date: 2013-08-11 06:06:28
to avoid the thermal printing problem I developed a dot matrix based paper wallet printer.
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:11:26
I don't trust thermal paper either. Check out my dot matrix based paper wallet solution.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:27:52
The source code is now available here.
This is the first time I've tried to publish arduino code so I'd appreciate any feedback if I can improve the structur of my repo.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:30:44
I'm working on publishing the source I need to check all the licenses are compatible.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:43:44
That can't be securely done without you having to retain something secret on your side that you would still be responsible for backing up. Its turtles all the way down.
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:49:42
you might be interested in my mini dot matrix based solution.

@_date: 2013-04-20 18:27:31
What would you recommend instead?
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:01:18
Buy more than 1 and make sure they generate different keys ;)
Sorry couldn't resist it :)
I completely understand your concern. Its exactly why I chose to build my own device.
I plan to publish the schematics and software as open source.
You can then either build one from the ground up. If you can understand the schematics and software you can then trust the device you have personally built and programmed.
If you buy one you can inspect it visually to see there are no evil components in it and load the software on the chip yourself.
This would unfortunately require some programming equipment on your side but its the only way to be sure the software is the same as the published version.
Any solution using anything other than microcontroller programming hardware and you would always have to trust the "bootloading" software that is already on the chip to not be evil.
I can't think of any other technical way to mitigate these valid concerns.
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:30:20
This is very important in my opinion. It'd be great if there was an interface to verify the code that is pre-loaded on the device so that random devices can be externally audited.
@_date: 2013-04-29 10:39:05
You can still smash up an offline generator :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:42:53
Do you mean  ?
I'd love to but the arduino is completely full. I either need a bigger chip to add any more functionality or drop a feature (like QR Codes, Printing or the LCD display)
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:09:19
We live in a world where a usb charger can infect a smartphone. If you plug anything (keyboard,mouse,power) into an exposed USB port on a raspberry pi it could get infected. Linux is pretty secure but vulnerabilities are found and patched. If the pi isn't updated its remains vulnerable. If it is updated then the update method becomes a vector for infection.
That's not "almost equivalent" in my mind.
Less software and no accessible ports = smaller attack surface =  more security
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:27:39
Thanks, I agree I think theres a lot of uses for generating a private key, bitcoin address pair on a device that is simply incapable of connecting to the internet or running arbitrary code.
The code is mostly BSD style, the qrcode is GPLv3.
So feel free to hack and fork away.
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:17:20
I've left a note in direct sunlight I'll let you know how it goes in a month :)
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:48:27
Linux compensates for the lack of entropy by providing a strong pseudo random number generator.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:40:56
I'm working on an offline bitcoin wallet printing project where the components are so dumb you hopefully won't need to shoot them after use.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:54:32
My hardware paper wallet printer uses good old dot matrix printing technology to avoid this issue.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:51:32
I purposely avoided direct thermal printers as I dind't consider them suitable for long term storage.
As far as I'm aware the only long term thermal technology is thermal transfer/resin printing I wasn't able to find a printer in the target price range.
I'll take a closer look at this 20 year archival paper though.
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:59:56
Paper Wallets are a great way to keep Bitcoins offline.
My Paper Wallet Printer makes it easy to create secure malware proof paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:59:25
If like me you don't trust thermal printers for long term cold storage you might prefer my project.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:30:41
The only way to be sure of step 2 is to use the programming tools provided by the microcontroller manufacturer.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:34:08
The smiley was meant to indicate a joke.
I hope the rest of the comment alleviated your concerns. The only thing I can do is to offer the software and hardware designs so you can build your own.
If you don't like my design or software then your only option is to design and build your own.
I'd heartily recommend it its great fun and I've learnt a hell of a lot on the way :)

If I took an old laptop and an old printer duct taped them together and declared it a standalone paper wallet printer would it somehow make it insecure compared to your own non duct taped laptop and printer because it is now a "hardware" solution that is not intended to run general purpose software?
You need to trust that your hardware has not been compromised you do this by looking at it and determining that there are no unexpected components.
You need to trust the software has not been compromised you do this by inspecting the software and checking there are no malicious features.
An explot doesn't need to be botcoin specific to be successful.
A keylogger for example could easily be hidden in general purpose hardware/software.
We're not talking custom designed ASIC chips for the current crop of paper wallet generators and transaction signong devices we're talking general purpose microcontrollers/microprocessors in a minimal package duct taped together.
The hardware can be verified that only off the shelf "hetrogeneous" components are used.
The software running on the microcontroller can be verified externally.
There is fundamentally no difference in terms of trust between running a paper wallet generator on general purpose computer and on a purpose build device.
The intention is to reduce the attack surface to make managing the security of such a device easier for the end user..
I of course agree with the original public service announcment in that its important that end users apply critical thinking when evalutaing the security of a device. Offline most definately does not equal secure.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:51:45
As Zman idnetified this would need an internet connection. There are already a couple of bitcoin ATM projects that aim to solve this problem.
I'm aiming to solve the offline generation of secure paper wallets problem.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:47:41
The printer prints a single line of dots with each pass and endlessy recycles the ribbon.
I doubt even Columbo could get the key off the ribbon.
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:43:13
I ported the code from other projects and coerced it to run in the constraints of the arduino.
The source code is here.
The m-190 dot matrix printer mechanism costs around €15 but requires ~€5 of additional components to drive it.
If my paper wallet plans come to nothing I might release a printer shield for the Arduino :)
@_date: 2013-06-22 07:05:15
The code is derived from my previous arduino bitcoin printer project 
I'll work towards getting the new code online I need to verify the licenses for the ARM toolchain I'm using.
I'm not sure what artwork you are referring to. The keyboard was extracted from an old handheld 5 language translator I had lying around. Because of the keyboard its a difficult demo to reproduce without redesigning the PCB to match the keyboard.
If anyone can point me to a cheap source of standard qwerty membrane keyboards I'd gladly put together a PCB for the standard layout and release the schematics.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:02:34
You'Re right I think the reference client checks. Its probably worth adding a line to the instruction manual that it's best practice to check if the address is in use before depositing large amounts of funds.

Is there anything you can demo yet?

A self printed paper wallet is the only physical Bitcoin I trust.
Even better if its printed with my hardware paper wallet printer.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:24:57
I wouldn't call the slots nice. It was my firts time using a dremel and I just hacked away at the box till it had some oles in it in about the right places. I figured finishing a stock box would be cheaper than building a custom box. Hopefully at scale the finishing process could be automated.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:17:01
I'm currently building on stripboard and I have no experience with PCB manufacture. I'm looking at ~€45 in parts so my gut feeling is €80-€90.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:20:50
This applies to all key generation methods. Including those built into bitcoin-qt.
It is possible there is a weakness in the hardware random number generator that will cause certain keys to be more likely.
To mitigate those risks I use a lot of bits and run them through statistical tests.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:38:59
Here's a picture of the innards.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:52:56
I'm working on it. There are a few more technical challenges to overcome before I would be willing to sell units. I was trying to gauge interest and develop a feeling for peoples concerns about such a device.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:49:30
I plan to make the plans and software available as open source so the paranoid can build their own.
I believe this is out of reach for most users so I believe there is a market to sell them.
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:42:23
Thats not the first complaint I've recieved but it works for me! I'll see if I can work out whats going on...
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:54:38
I could certainly make use the extra ram and performance :)
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:31:52
I plan to publish the hardware and software. For the truly paranoid you should be able to compile the software and flash it to the device yourself.
The device currently executes the monobit and runs test at the 1% level from the NIST statisitcal test suite.
I chose these 2 due to size constraints of the chip I'm using. As I move to a faster/larger chip I will add more internal sanity checks.
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:48:04
That was me.
I currently use an internal source of entropy but I'm investigating attaching a keyboard so YOU can be the entropy and effectively print out brain wallets with no exposure to the internet.
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:33:30
What software reads the SD card?
Do you trust that whoever flashed the SD reading software to the chip (i.e. me) didn't inject a backdoor?
@_date: 2013-07-11 19:34:57
For anyone worried about using thermal paper for archival you might be interested in my mini dot matrix based solution.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:50:10
Yes you can upload your own software. You can make the LED blink in morse code and Print "Hello World" if you like :)
The programming functionality is built into the uC. Once you've verified the reset pin of the programmer is connected to the reset pin of the uC I'm out of the loop. Programming effectively occurs with the reset button held down meaning user code cannot run.
I wanted to demonstrate that you can non destructively check that shipped printers contain published and peer reviewed software.
This would help to build trust in me as at any time any one could open the printer and verify the software.
I'll look into the dual factor approach. I think it would set a lot of peoples minds at rest. All the code reviews in the world won't help if the hardware RNG is weak.
@_date: 2013-05-12 09:22:58
It's a dot matrix printer that uses Epson ERC-09 ribbons
This is my experience with dot matrix vs thermal.
These 2 receipts have been treated identically they have sat in a dark sealed folder for ~10 years.
The dot matrix print out is 2 years older and much clearer.
@_date: 2013-06-22 07:05:58
Good point. I added a warning the the video description.
@_date: 2013-05-11 16:03:49
If the bits fail the statistical test then the RNG generator is put into a "suspect" mode. 10 more runs of 12 thousand bits are gathered if enough of these new runs pass the statistical test then the original "suspect" bits are accepted and used as the private key. This prevents the key space from being reduced but allows pathalogical failure of the RNG to be detected.
I'm looking into using the analog timing signal from the printer motor as a source of entropy.
Finally I might fill the EEPROM of the chip with entropy from random.org and mix that in too.
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:51:12
I can probably estimate the entropy by checking for dictionary words and even warn if the pass phrase is entirely dictionary words.
The cpu is not fast enough to effectively perform a brute force attack.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:19:09
I built myself an offline bitcoin address generator.
It can take a private key or brain wallet phrase and calculate the corresponding bitcoin address.
It includes the same checks that bitcoind performs when generating an address.
This enables you to verify offline that the private key matches the address without revealing the private key.
You can then verify using blockchain.info any other web wallet that the address contains funds.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:23:37
Fortunately bitfrore is based on a microcontroller rather than a PC like the rPi. There is no SD card slot and no python scripts to edit. The linked series of blog posts explain more about bitfrore and its security.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:07:42
Several concerns have been raised about how to be sure that the code on my bitcoin printer doesn't maliciously generate keys that are known to me.
The only way to verify this is to inspect the circuit board for malicious components and to verify the software on the chip to ensure it matches the published source code.
This video shows how this can be accomplished using a device called an in system programmer.
I recommend that all bitcoin related hardware be accomponied by schematics and source code and that the hardware should provide a method to verify the software that is outside the control of the software author.
