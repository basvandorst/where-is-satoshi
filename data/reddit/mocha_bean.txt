No, I've never bought any Bitcoin. Just looking at the pretty undeniable fact that bitcoin has gone from $900 to $19,000 and then to $8,000 in the span of twelve months. If you're trying to argue that Bitcoin isn't volatile, I'm not really sure where you're coming from.

I don't think money works how you think it works.

Even if 1% of all purchases resulted in a chargeback — which would be ridiculous — the risk would be *nothing* compared to Bitcoin's price volatility. Like, what do you do if all the revenue you just collected suddenly loses half it's value?

What are *you* talking about? Why would eBay be "insane not to" accept Bitcoin?

Because it's volatile and extremely risky.

Bitcoin is orders of magnitude more risky than credit cards.
Yeah, merchant adoption would probably reduce volatility, but that hasn't happened yet. And the risk of a handful of buyers doing chargebacks is nothing compared to, I don't know, Bitcoin suddenly dropping to $1000.

Past performance is not indicative of future performance.


So you're suggesting that eBay should... store part of its assets in it?

Most users *already* don't know how bitcoin works. Hell, most people don't even know how fiat currency works. What's your point?
