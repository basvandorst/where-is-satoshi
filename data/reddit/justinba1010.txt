Yes exactly. I once spent hundreds of bitcoins to someone to get a computer kit shipped to me. I basically got the computer kit for free, but like at the time I was like wow that's cool I made couple hundred bucks, not oh shoot let me buy back so I can make millions.

I just want to add Bitcoin has been growing somewhat exponentially.  
[Bitcoin Blocksize Log Chart](  
A linear progression = exponential growth, at this rate ~400% a year from(2009), ~300% a year(YTD) we will hit 8MB in less than 3 years.  
3^x = 8MB/(0.6)MB &lt;-- Determine number of years until we hit 8 MB  
x log 3 = log 13.33  
x = 2.35  
So 6 years = 1 MB isn't accurate.  
But I do NOT expect Bitcoin to maintain such high growth.  
  
Add just so I have math:  
I found 400% by finding how large the avg. block today is vs. what it was in the beginning(0.0001 MB). Which is 6000 times larger. Then I figured the annual growth that maintains 6000 times growth in 6 years. So:  
x^6 = 6000  x
x = 6000^(1/6)  
x ~= 400%
Annual growth = ~400%  
Edit: Just so we have the 300% figure, I did the same with .6MB(today) and ~.2MB(June 2014).  
x^1 = (.6)/(.2)  
x ~= 300%

Completely out of context. Here's the original context.
    Consider three conflicting or opposing viewpoints, all of which are equally valid from their
    individual points­of­view as Rational Economic Actors:
    1. Early Adopter: Do not increase 1MB speed limit. I am happy to pay high fees to secure
    my bitcoin. I make 1­2 transactions per year.
    2. Cautious Miner: Only increase the 1MB speed limit a little. Enough for adoption, not
    enough to reduce my fee income.
    3. Funded Startup: Scale bitcoin to VISA rates in 12 months. Keep fees near zero to
    subsidize adoption. On­board 1 billion users in 2 years. No speed limit.

So let's just do this in a purely mathematical way. Say he is putting $50 every two weeks. Then because we need BTC to go to the moon for this investment to be worthwile the PP of BTC goes up 40% a year, and let's say the USD faces 0% inflation against this 40% deflation(relative). Then the amount of BTC you can buy is .2x.6^(t/24). So let's make a geometric summation formula.(I don't know how to get a sigma notation on reddit). EDIT: t is the # paycheck after the initial, so the first one would be 0, the first one the following year would be 24(just say 2 a month).  
S n=0; n &lt;= 240: .2x.6^(t/24)  
now let's get a formula we can plug into a geometric sum formula of a1(1-r^(n))/(1-r) by taking the 24^th root of .6  
S n=0; n&lt;=240: .2*(0.97894051332^(t))  
Now we can do the simple formula:  
0.2x(1-(0.97894051332)^(240))/(1-0.97894051332) ~ 9.5 BTC  
Now at this point bitcoins will have 1/0.97894051332^(240) times more purchasing power or ~165x. So Bitcoins would be worth around $41000 and you would own 9.5 BTC. So you would own a portfolio of $389500 in Bitcoins. Now 40% deflation is an arbitrary number and we don't even know if Bitcoins will exist then, and also USD inflation should allow you to buy more BTC at the end because the last year you would be buying less than .00001 BTC over the course of the whole year. So I guess it would be feasible, but if Bitcoins were to have a 40% deflation rate or purchasing power increase(I like this word better), you'd be better off taking a huge loan at 3-7% interest and buying BTC and paying it off at your retirement. So it all depends on how much risk you're willing, and more importantly capable of taking, and I highly recommend you DON'T(edit lol) ruin your life with a huge loan for bitcoins, and more importantly it isn't known what the value of BTC will be in 10 years. Hope I could've helped this. Btw if you stopped buying BTC after 10 years and it kept it's deflation rate at 40% after another 10 years, bitcoins would be worth 600 million dollars a piece and your portfolio would be ~ 5.7 billion dollars, and Bitcoins market cap would be around 840000 times greater than the GDP of the US. So to the moon!

The one problem with that is that the government is limited in what it can do with the internet(citation: First Amendment). Companies are not.
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:12:42
Have you ever read anything about the balance of powers? It's what our entire government is based on. It creates a system of checks and balances. Now say you took away the Supreme Court, the presidency and congress now have nothing preventing them from pretty much absolute control. Libertarians, IMO, tend to in their antigovernment stance overlook other threats to individual freedom, and honestly I wish they didn't because it would make the ideology more applicable to my generation.
Now let's say the cable companies were given unlimited control of the internet, gov't is out of the picture completely. Now Netflix comes along and says, hey we have a new competitor, if I pay you some $ will you throttle their connections? Comcast of course goes well now that net neutrality is gone, I can and I like $. Now you just killed the basis of a free market, and made it an oligarchy.
Now I'll explain why it's so important. The internet is based on freedom, think about it, anyone can do anything, learn about anything etc. It's the uncensored medium of information. To agree with me you would have to value the benefits of the FREE exchange of information have brought to us, scientists can send information, new ideas, and collaborate, banks can communicate, I can communicate to you.
Now(if net neutrality were to be stricken down) Comcast can do anything they want to your information. This would be bad for a huge list of reasons, mostly because one party has a lot of unnecessary power.
I would expect you'd be pretty literate in the constitution, being a libertarian, or at least seeming to be one. The constitution is meant to give the government its structure and limit its power. Now the first amendment says the GOVERNMENT cannot censor information. This doesn't mean CNN can't cut you from the air, etc, like they might for a rogue actor who says things that CNN or A&amp;E doesn't agree with. The internet is a medium of information exchange. Now the government cannot censor that, and for the most part no one can(Net Neutrality), unless you were doing illegitimate activities, then you lose that right, such as pirating, but that's besides the point. And for the most part, the reason the internet isn't censored is because the US Gov't has jurisdiction over it, not Comcast. And under the First Amendment, the gov't cannot do anything to censor it. Now say you remove the jurisdiction, and take away the rules that ISPs have to play by, now you have a few select companies that can control what flows over their cables. You can see why it's very important we keep this power away from anyone. It's a very important thing, the Internet, that needs to remain untampered.

Actually not having repeats would make it less secure. It’s how Enigma was broken. Ill give two examples.
Say we have a 10 digit code, and it can start with zero(make the math easier). Then we have about 3.6 million permutations. However if there are repeats allowed we have 10 billion. That is over a 99% reduction in security.
Say we have 100 words. The difference is a lot more subtle. If we have a 24 word key, with no repeats we have about if I did the math right 2.82EE46 permutations. However if we allow repeats it jumps to 10^50. Slightly less than 50 fold, which is childs play in modern security, but the point stands. The difference becomes significant when we do a 100 word key. 10^200 vs 10^158. 10^42 times harder to break.
Real world security is very different tho. I mean heck the enigma was mostly broken because every message ended in “Heil Hitler.”

If I recall the premise of Bitcoin was that you no longer need banks. It was all going to be you are your own bank. Hell I have a paperwallet in my wallet at all times just in case I can give someone a chance to learn about it. I can wire some of my savings account, if someone accepts a promise to pay Bitcoin I can understand, but from what I recall Bitcoin was never meant to be able to be compatible with fractional reserve banking. Also the I'm promising you this Bitcoin, but not giving it to you isn't going to catch on in a highly libertarian community.  
The premise of all those financial instruments rely on a growth in productivity and an even slightly greater growth in money supply. Bitcoin will lack the growth in money supply.

Well I had $9k in a bank at one point, a large sum of it was removed when a check bounced on a family member because I am underage, and after that I decided saving for a measly 1-2% interest was a bad idea and investing it was probably much better. Unfortunately after the bounce I was left with some 3600 and thought my life would be much better spending it then, probably because I was 13, and was pretty shocked that a bank would make the float for multiple people in my family just because I was underage, and all this is legal.

I mean is it absolutely necessary for you to have all this security even for large amounts of money? Mt Gox didn't go down cause there Cold Storage wasn't cold enough, Mt Gox went down because there was nothing close to Cold Storage, I mean he was SSHing into a live server with all the Bitcoin keys unencrypted.

That's true(After writing this I think you're right but more importantly BTC is rising in value). Today there was 10k BTC bought and sold on [Bitstamp]( This means a volume of 2.6 Million dollars. The total Bitcoin in circulation has risen 3600 just today. Now [BitcoinCharts]( says that Bitstamp is 12% of all BTC trades, this means we have roughly a volume of(let's assume 20% to be on the safe side), 13M a day or 50k BTC a day. So the market cap has to increase by 1M a day. Now the great thing about Bitcoin is that it's governed entirely by game theory, so the only way this price could be stable is if the people who are buying it believe that Bitcoin's value is increasing at 1M a day. If they don't, then they wouldn't buy at that price, they would wait for equilibrium at a lower price. If Apple was making stock at 10% inflation, the price would most likely decrease, Bitcoin has derailed this so we must be on a bullish trend that is mitigated by inflation.  
Edit I forgot that even though miners may not be buying BTC, they are investing electricity and paying for that for them.

@_date: 2015-08-07 21:57:15
That 97% is a bit of an overstatement. Actually I did a google search, and according to the St. Louis Fed back in the 80s for every dollar in existence there was 2 in fractional reserve lending meaning we had a money multiplier of 3. Today after the Great Recession that number is actually a negative 30 cents. It's due to banks not believing in the economy and thus not investing and loaning. So we did have 70% at one point, but today that number is 0%. Which is probably keeping up all the Fed directors as they try to save the economy and can't do anything of real meaning besides print more which just shoots this number lower. Today there is [4.0 Trillion Dollars]( in circulation, a [2.5 Trillion]( in banking accounts, travelers checks etc(not bank reserves). This ratio is called the Money Multiplier and it is actually [net negative]( This is a very scary thing for the Fed, but alas Bitcoin will be structured in a completely different way where there will always be 21M coins, and x that aren't lost and actually part of the economy and y that are in savings indefinitely. There may never be fractional reserve banking in Bitcoin.

I don't really do it as an investment, because if I wanted to invest there's an incredible bull run(I'm just short on the capital) happening on Wall St. and with some leeway and stop orders I'm sure you can turn 10% by the end of the year with little risk(I think this bull run still has some oomph left in it), but alas I've always believed stocks and certain financial instruments are bullshit, for lack of a better word.

That may be true, what happened was my mom made a check for the mortgage and my dad didn't know, he was planning on paying it the next month. It bounced, the bank decided to pay Wells Fargo some 5k from my account and then tack on I think a hundred or two in fees. My parents have since paid me back, but the lump sum vs having a cash on my excessively for a while was what prevented me from doing anything productive with it. By law I was 13 I had to get an account attached to both my parents and etc, I just found the fact that there are antilaundering laws like that etc to be a burden on personal freedom and I think that amount of control of someone's capital is a bit of a crime. I'm pretty sure the law said it was my parents money and I couldn't be a self sufficient individual until 16 or 18. I'm not upset I've had a pretty good life to this point, and I do have two more years until I can live the wonderful life of amassing an incredible debt for a measly degree. It's really not a big deal considering how desperate our financial situation was, I just wished the bank let me know hey we're planning on taking 5k from your account etc do you have something else you would like to do, which probably would've let us handle those 3 months much better than my parents did.

If I recall 0.51 W/Gh is the most efficient out there. I would put money that no more than 20-50% of the hashing rate is created at that efficiency. I'd say the network is probably running around 1-2 W/Gh mostly because Chinese miners are supposedly getting free electricity, so they may be just running the cheapest miners. Also 15 c/kWh is the average in the US and I'm pretty sure the US has some of the cheaper energy in the West. So the electricity cost is probably closer to 100-250k in costs(Chinese taxpayers pay the subsidy).

1. Change the preferences so the fee is something higher than the norm, like .001/kb maybe?
2. Sweep the old private key to another address in your wallet.
3. Before broadcasting this tx to the network make sure the fee is satisfiable other wise go to step 2.
4. Wait for a confirmation.
5. Resend tx with higher fee from different address.  
  
You're going to lose some money like 10-20 cents doing it this way but it's the only way I found to do it with Electrum.

I think that's a great metric. Would it be more appropriate to square root that to estimate the % hash rate you would need as an attack to coordinate the same risk? I don't know because I can see that with just the odds of two consecutive blocks it doesn't really carry over to me, maybe others. I think the %hashrate it's equivalent to, e.g. 33.5% in this case is more promising to get the message through. Cause I think it would seem more like what are the odds of a successful block switch(double spend?), by the entire network, and what's the equivalent hash rate needed to emulate those same odds. In this case 33.5%. So it would take 33.5% of the network to be a single attacker to have the same compromised security we have. Maybe even compare the hash rate to the biggest miner. I do like the idea of two consecutive blocks as a measuring stick for centralization.

What stated was that the majority of this debt incurred when Greece got into the EU. It suddenly became a lot easier to borrow money from banks to buy nice things. So they did. Now it's biting them in the ass because if the banks don't get payed back that debt, or it gets defaulted on, they can't incur that on their books, and so they go insolvent, and the same situation we are trying to avoid goes down anyway. It's not the banks fault so much as it's the fault of the Greek Government for borrowing so much and never having a way to repay.

Do you actually have $1M in Bitcoin? I would assume dumping it that quickly would disrupt the market. I guess it would take months to do so safely, and maybe you want to relocate yourself overseas where you're less likely to have it seized or any issues.

Let's say to create a SHA256 hash we need to complete 64 rounds of SHA256 for a single block. Let's pretend that a round is a single change in a single bit's entrophy. This means a single SHA256 hash consists of 2^6 * 1.4x10^-23 J at 0 K = So we now have increased our 2^256 to 2^262 bit changes in entrophy. Now each address is a double SHA256 hash, that's another tick in entrophy, so 2^263. Now there is also a RIPEMD160 hash, let's say this has 10 rounds or "five double rounds", so let's for ease just say it has 8 changes in bit entrophy. We're now at 2^266 changes in bit entrophy. Which we now can say we have 2^266 x 1.4 x 10^-23 = 1.66 x 10^57 J at 0 K. Some 30 magnitudes greater than your number. But then again I went the route that we have a perfect computer, that can calculate these hashes in very few steps(impossible unless these hashes are one day broken or severely weakened), and we have to calculate every private address and cannot just look for the first 2^160 possible ones because there WILL be collisions at that point. The bigger concern than this, because energy is a constraining factor here is if one day ECC, ECDSA, SHA256, RIPEMD160, are ever broken or severely weakened, because we will have to change it in Bitcoin. Note: even if any of them are weakened we're probably in the clear.

He does have a point, if the block reward were to disappear(it will by 2140) now we would have an unsustainable situation, where to keep the same security we would need $1M in fees/day. This means we have 144MB in blocksize a day and we would need to have a fee of $7/KB. Right now this fee is around $0.10/KB. Hopefully we have a 64MB blocksize where this is sustainable and we can once again have 0.10/KB and have $1M generated through mining fees daily. But it will be some time before 64MB blocks.

No. Technically it's one of those ETNs/ETFs. I don't remember the difference, but there should be .1 BTC in reserve for every share. Technically due to their 2% inflation allowance, 0.09653305 BTC per share. The assets under management is held at 35.48M. It is still better to buy into BTC yourself because you lose 2% of your BTC every year, but the main attracting point is the tax deference. But no it's not a company, its one of those weird financial instruments.

Because Bitcoin relies on the security of one's system and how cryptographically random its random number generator is. Creamed corn sales don't affect Bitcoin, thousands of people losing millions of dollars due to a flaw in the most widely used Operating System definitely pertains to Bitcoin and its viability.

I read the original paper about it, and have been trying to read the source code of a lot of these alt-coins. But it's a really intense thing between interfacing to the network and cryptography. After quite some googling and reading around I didn't understand what prevents two alt-coins from converging their transactions lists and other information. Now I understand that it's the network port and magic key that prevents this.
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:39:23
Thanks, see I was reading the code to Zcoin, and it's tough to follow. I didn't open up the original Bitcoin source because of mostly it's in C and really tough to follow. If there was some pseudocode implementation of Bitcoin this question wouldn't exist. I know that 5 games won't collide because there is a protocol that dedicates RAM and CPU power to certain applications built into Operating Systems. I want to understand the protocol that prevents this in Bitcoin.

Would it be possible to sort of emulate communication with the rest of the network with some other code that outputs valid information then?
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:57:35
I see, so besides the blockchain, the other security features are that they use different ports and from what I'm understanding some magic network id. Is there any source I can find a hexadecimal view of a transaction? Breaking Bitcoin would be way beyond me, if it's even possible with modern technology, I'm just trying to understand it.

I'm pretty sure for that to happen the difficulty would need to be 2^224 or 10^67. I don't think it will happen in our lifetimes mostly because of the physical limits of the universe and that the required energy to perform 30%(I think that's the birthday probability) is well more than energy ever used by humans. If it does we better have something better than Bitcoin.

Who would sue them? Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P service, I don't think UK courts would even entertain this. It'd be like someone sending hundreds of thousands of emails, it happens, except Bitcoin has a hardcoded limit on bandwidth and a PoW system which means these stress tests put a burden on the system. Also for people to claim damages they need to give up pseudonymity, something most do not wish to do. I highly doubt there will be legal ramifications to the stress tests.

Right now almost all discrete logarithm algorithms run in exponential time. Shor's Algorithm will run in polynomial time. A exponential example would be if it takes 4^(# of bits) operations to find a discrete logarithm. However the same in polynomial time would be 4*(# of bits)^2. Just to show the way it grows here's some examples(4 is a constant I made up).  
Bits | Polynomial | Exponential  
So it greatly reduces the amount of effort it takes to solve a discrete logarithm problem when Shor's Algorithm has the implementation suitable enough.

In Computer Science there's a conjecture, it goes is NP = P. [If the answer to a problem is easy to check, is the problem itself easy to solve?]( Asymmetric cryptography is based on in Bitcoin's case the ease of point additions of an elliptic curve over a Galois field versus the difficulty of what we'll call point division. In Bitcoin, your private key is the number of point additions to arrive at your public address(a point on the Galois Field) privatekey*point = publicpoint. For clearing things up a Galois field, in Bitcoin is just a two dimensional clock. Think what time 13 o'clock is, it's 1. Two figure out what 75 o'clock is, is easy, what is the smallest multiple of 7 that if put on that clock equals 1 o'clock is a lot harder. You essentially have to try every multiple up to 12(order of 7x mod 12). Shor's Algorithm, the quantum algorithm in question can solve this much easier than conventional algorithms, which are exponentially timed right now. When we have a quantum computer, modern crypto, minus a few systems like NTRUE, which honestly I have no idea how it works, is out the window.

If I understand, if A is paying B, A would keep making new txs and signing them, then sending them to B. B would decided to publish the best tx for his sake, which because A is paying B, would be the most recent. Why would A send a tx with less payment to B, if B can just publish an older tx. I think, I've barely skimmed the white paper, you would need to open a new payment channel to have a reverse tx. Then both would just close both channels when either party sees fit(if capable), and it would be trustless.
