Transferwise.com is cheap and works great

Should be perfectly safe

3000€ a year, 1000€ per transaction max if you don't verify your identity. The nice thing about Bitcoin.de is that you make a sepa transfer to the seller so it doesn't look like you are buying bitcoin (compared to transferring to kraken or Coinbase).you also fix the price when you buy without having to have funds on an exchange.

This shows that we probably don't need to keep the datacenters as clean and cold as it's usually done.

Doesn’t the company report its payments to the IRS? Here in Spain, like in most EU countries, both parties have to send all their labour bills to the IRS and everything is checked to see that it has a legitimate source/origin.

You restore/initialize the second trezor with the seed of the first one.  Then use the same passphrase on both.  If you want you can use a different PIN
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:54:24
With the seed you can restore on another hardware wallet or a software one.  But if I were you, i would initialize the backup trezor with the same seed. That way you have it ready to use in case of problems. I assume that you are using passphrases, right?  That way the security of the seed or the trezor itself is not that important.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:18:20
Really, since you bothered looking at the documentation you should have posted the advanced recovery method 
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:18:39


They don't. On the new trezor they can be typed on the trezor itself.

Use 1password. Has OTP support and will work between all your devices without being vulnerable as authy.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:19:00
you don't need to destroy the seed if you use a passphrase: 
I do like the idea of having several hardware wallets with the same seed. The seed can be saved somewhere but if it's compromised they won't get the correct master key.
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:10:24
Could you make yourself a favor and read  entirely? How the advance recovery works, how the pin is entered, the passphrase as a way of having decoy wallets, security best practices, etc. Then imagine yourself traveling somewhere and having to send a transaction from an Internet cafe or similar. A really un trusted internet connection and computer. Do you still prefer to travel with the raspberry instead of a trezor/ledger? If you do, you are a little bit insane.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:07:02
There's an advanced recovery method where you input the seed on the trezor. Slow but safe. Make a new one, recover it with the advanced method and keep using it.  
But you don't really need to test the seed, it will work. I would buy another trezor and initialize it with the same key. And ALWAYS use a pass phrase.
Also, use it as a login device in gmail, Dropbox, etc instead of SMS 2FA
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:08:43
Advantages of multisig 1 of 2 vs having the same seed on both? I only see disadvantages 
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:08:57
or a trezor and you can also store your cryptocurrency on it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:46:34
Don't do it. A trezor is much safer than using a raspberry, more reliable, tiny and you won't have problems if it's stolen. They come on sealed tamper proof boxes without a firmware installed so you know that the correct one is installed. The pin, pass phrase and recovery procedures have been smartly designed. And there's no attack vector that hasn't been anticipated. Please read the whole trezor user manual and after reading it, let me know if you still think a homemade solution can be safer.
 I've been working with computers and electronics my whole life and I wouldn't be able to create a system as secure and easy to use. I trust 100% my trezor and would still do even with hundreds of coins.

Awesome reply. I feel better now knowing that there's people at kraken that I can contact and get help in case of a big problem like this one. Great job

you have a passphrase  that acts as the 25th word and is not written down, making it super secure. It gives you multiple wallets (seeds, accounts, etc) just changing the passphare.  Read about it because it's fucking awesome and what may change your mind about hardware wallets: 
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:34:34
of course: 
Do yourself a favor and please read the whole user manual. You'll discover how well designed it is, some features as the encrypted labels inside dropbox are developed in a very smart way. I trust the coins in my trezor 100%, I would even give it to someone or destroy it an not be scared of losing my coins.
