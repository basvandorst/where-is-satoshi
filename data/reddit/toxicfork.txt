I strongly doubt your final statement. Not everyone will have the memories of others, maybe in a couple years new people may not even know of this situation, and existing traders may just think "it's not gonna happen again". Also, don't you think those "reactionary" regulations have possibly prevented repetitions of those incidents?

Hmm it's a security issue if the website is trying to load scripts from all these peers, any one of them could inject some potentially malicious code to the page to do bad things. Like set the fee to 100% but display 0, or alter other pool ip addresses, or much worse things.

I believe it will go down either way, but I could be wrong.
But if I had those cheap goxbux and I could get them out, I would. Then sell them eventually. I am wondering how many of those guys are desperate enough to sell immediately. I'm expecting a nice peak as people buy goxbux back and then a nice dip as they sell them on other markets.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:14:09
Like any other virus, that executable's signature would get added to the virus databases too, as usual. You could send people some images first with embedded encrypted code in them, and then send a similar virus to decrypt then execute, and it's the same thing. Never launch untrusted executables, or run the full bitcoin node on a separate machine.
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:46:12
Are you related to [this site]( I think they might have just copied your content.
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:01:56
Then they would need to make the change to the wallet executable anyway. At that point they may just as well do anything they wish to do, no need to use the blockchain as a source for the instructions.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:00:02
The thing is, if they run away, it is very unlikely that you get either btc or fiat even if you sue, but if it doesn't die you still keep cheap coins

It's not an executable. And if someone did manage to have the bitcoin client do bad things through the block chain, you would hear about it here.

BUT WHAT IF NOSCRIPT IS EVIL
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:03:03
Technically, they are not really selling. There are people on the exchange which have USD, and there are people on the exchange which have BTC. These people are trading between each other. Mtgox is still profiting from the fees, and only withdrawals are affected, so they can allow people to keep on trading until withdrawals are back up. They do not care about the rest of the market, they are actually profiting from the fees whenever someone trades.

Democracy is only there to make decisions for the people. First of all, about law. What should be legal and what should not be, based on the decisions of the majority of the people.
Sure some of the decisions can be based on money, so for example "where should money be spent on for the community". And yeah, one way of collecting money to spend by using tax. Tax isn't debt though. Debt is spending more money than you have. So, if someone buys a house they can't afford, they go into debt. So, for example you collect 10000 units of currency as tax, spend 5000 of it on better healthcare, 1000 on education, and when you run out, you stop and wait until you have more funds available. Debt only happens when you spend more than you have.
capitalism:  because I suck at explaining things.
TL;DR: Democracies don't have to be capitalists, but so far, they have been. So yeah maybe you can say "democracy means debt" but that's only because everyone associates democracy with capitalism.

AFAIK if someone places a very large buy or sell order the website goes through the list of unfilled orders and one by one it fills them. I have noticed this on a few markets. So, if you're trying to sell 10 bitcoins and there are 10 waiting buy orders all for 1 bitcoin each, there will be 10 events instead of 1.

Actually, what is "value"? "Having more things than your neighbour"? 
Yeah. You can live with yourself without interaction to others and eat what you produce. That's just "staying away from capitalism", imo.
There are other ways than capitalism, but capitalism fits best because of people's greed. "I work more so I should get more" turns into "I have to have everything".
Or.. you can eat x amount to survive, but food is tasty so you want to have x+1. or 2. or 3. or EVERYTHING.

Well ideally you should get what you give in value eventually. As I said in the post above (it's probably minus zero now ;p) democracies don't have to deal with money they don't have. Ideally a perfect democracy would be a self-sustaining one (without taxation); thus you would have the government getting money from the services they provide (to other countries or its people) instead of taking it from the earnings of the people. Thus there wouldn't be debt (at least in the government)!

Of course you are allowed to do that but you need to be able to earn enough in order to buy the land or anything else.

Does Privoxy protect you from DNS spoofing?
For those who don't know:
You are placing a lot of trust in the DNS. E.g. you say  
-"what's the ip address of [your favorite bitcoin exchange]?", It says  
-sure, it's "some.fake.address.here" (warning, not actually [your favorite bitcoin exchange])
Then your machine goes to that IP address, and it pops up a login page, looks exactly like the site, the URL matches perfectly. So you enter your login details. It even asks you your 2-factor authentication code which you supply happily, but after that it gives you an error saying "you can't login, please retry in a few moments". You are annoyed, but something worse has just happened: all of your BTC is sent to a random address! How did it happen? **DNS SPOOFING!**
That's assuming you didn't notice the missing https:// in the address bar.
Edit: I guess if it did reverse DNS requests in its own servers somehow and the IP address didn't match it could possibly give a warning... if it does that, very cool.

Hmm... system-wide DNS settings... someone should write a bit about the **very** serious security implications of that into the wiki.

It all makes sense now. They're all one person!
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:40:35
Could be done similar to how is done. Someone can text a number with "[password] SEND [amount] [phone number/bitcoin address]", and then the service would check if the phone number is registered to it, then it would send the coins to the target address or let them know (via SMS) how they can set up an account.

It takes **at least** 4 weeks to get your money out of MtGox. It takes a significant amount of time to get your money into BTC-E. On top of that, there are fees on both sides.
However, if you get a flow going, you can of course try it out.

Yep, OP understands less about Bitcoin than he/she thinks, and now looks like someone just pushing for regulation.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:40:43

I see it as an opportunity to buy more when they panic sell :D
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:28:21
1. There is only one internet, no competition 
 * Multiple service providers.
2. With more users and adoption, as its usability increased, the cost of the internet went down.
 * No, the cost of subscribing to internet went down because of competition between service providers.
You're misunderstanding the analogy. The spread of Bitcoin means the price will go up, as more people will want to buy in, and there is little supply. 
There is competition for Bitcoin too, other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin. This will drive the prices down for all competitors, as people can decide to buy less of the more expensive one and buy more of the cheaper one. Just like they do with internet service providers :)

I understand your excitement but please do not include "how awesome is that? to the moon and beyond!" in the title, it's against reddit etiquette, more specifically the item which recommends to "Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free".
This way you can let people decide how they want to vote on a link. It feels a bit circle-jerky as it is.

So it shows that the current price for each share is 2.473503BTC. So, if I buy a share, will it take me around 65 weeks to get it back, assuming the dividend amounts stay the same? I have not done anything like this, just wondering.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:32:42
bitstamp, mtgox have public APIs, there are many many more though.

The vanity gen is creating a lot of private keys, then generating the public keys from the private ones. If the public key matches, then it reveals the private key.

@_date: 2013-11-24 18:56:45
I am guessing it would be difficult, but perhaps merchants would register their wallet addresses with the government, and pay tax on the amount received. Then the government could periodically audit the merchants (like they do now) to check if they are accepting payments via bitcoin, and if the addresses are registered or not. Not sure how it would work with the "auto-generated address per customer" feature.
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:41:38

It means we as users cannot be sure if whoever built it has not installed a backdoor^* on it. Since Ubuntu is open source the likelihood of a backdoor is reduced greatly, because people can download the source code and look at every single line of code, then compile it themselves (assuming the compiler does not place a backdoor, [which HAS happened before :D](

The ports don't really matter, the thing you need to care about is: never give personal information or passwords to any website unless it satisfies these two conditions: 
1. You trust the URL
2. You're using https and there is a green padlock on the left side of the address bar (may be different for some browsers)

You're not really handling yourself well here, dude. Here's an advice, don't respond to every comment. It makes you look desperate. Please feel free to respond to this one if it makes you feel any better, though.
I understand you didn't understand what JDSlim meant in the first place, I was confused, too. But there will be people who get offended at everything anyone says, it's just better not to respond to them.
Just an observation from my end: I was interested in what you had to say until I read some of your comments. Now I don't have that much respect for you.

Educate your parents about it and ask if they could convert some of your allowance to bitcoins.
