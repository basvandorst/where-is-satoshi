Okay, no more r/bitcoin for me.

Bitcoin will succeed as a mainstream currency when people start making threads like this concerning its functionality instead of its price in USD. The cryptocurrency community is turning on each other over which brand is the best, while all cryptocurrencies are quickly and surely being assimilated into the financial system they were supposed to improve. 
The p2p digital currency dream has been replaced by people arguing over which middleman is the most suitable for turning their bitcoin into as many dollars as possible.

Sounds like a lot of things have to go right at the right moments, but at least it's a plan. Thanks for the explanation.

I just asked this question in another thread, but since I haven't gotten an answer yet I'll post it here too. If everyone switches to LN and stops paying on-chain fees, will there be enough incentive to maintain the core blockchain network decentralized, considering the bitcoin reward for mining will also be reduced over time? Won't only large mining pools survive? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:37:46
Gotcha, thanks.

With a 20% banking fee no less.

Since you seem to be on top of things, I'd like to use this opportunity to ask a question about LN: 
How does the long term maintenance of the blockchain network look when LN will be vastly reducing the number of transactions, and thus reducing the amount of fees, and mining will gradually reward less bitcoins on top of that? Will there be enough incentive to maintain a decentralized network or will only large hubs survive?

If that's already here, and centralizing mining leads to a reduction in security, then is bitcoin becoming less secure over time? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:20:43
Aren't they the ones who validate and pass along the completed block that miners make? So even if they made some manipulation, decentralized nodes would reject them?
I'm asking because I keep seeing people complain about high fees, but fees are what's supposed to incentivize mining, so if they are low who will mine besides centralized mining pools, especially once the bitcoin reward lowers?

You'd be surprised. 
This isn't some region specific thing, banks everywhere have a million regulations and standards to adhere to, and they were implemented to protect customers and the banks themselves long before cryptocurrencies existed. This kneejerk assumption that someone is always out to get bitcoin has to stop if it is to have any chance of being taken seriously. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:57:23
And if by 2140 all bitcoins are mined and people stop mining, who will maintain the network? Can bitcoin exist without miners? Will some government take up all the nodes and thus assume control? Will they someohw introduce new bitcoins to mine, thus effectively printing money and doing the thing so many bitcoin enthusiasts hate about fiat? I have so many questions, but everyone seems too focused on HODL and posting pictures of their new cars. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:40:12
Is there any reason to think mining won't become more and more concentrated over time? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:42
So hypothetically if all miners are under one roof but nodes remain global, bitcoin will still be secure from manipulation?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:24:56
I'm sorry, but how exactly will a decentralized network replace banks? Who's going to be giving out the business loans and mortgages? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:10:38
ICO is like an IPO, but for a new form of cryptocurrency, right? What does that have to do with banks? The fact that major innovations were unpredictable or laughed at doesn't mean we should just blindly believe anything is possible and ignore any possible implications of a change. 
Banking has existed since people started trading in currency. There is no currency that will remove the need for banks, since banks are a function of currency. There were banks when the currency was bronze coins, there were banks when currency was backed by the gold standard, and there continued to be banks after it was abolished. The only time there weren't banks was when people traded in cows and pigs. The entire western world is built upon the concept of credit, and you can't have credit without something to issue it.

Thanks, I'll check that out, but in the meantime I have a more core question. When you say cryptocurrency will replace banks, do you mean banks like the Federal Reserve or banks like Bank of America? Based on my limited understanding of blockchain technology, I can see how its implementation can result in drastic changes of the former, but I can't see the latter ever changing unless we stop using currency altogether. Bitcoin will not replace the need for financing, and as long as there's a need for financing, there will be institutions that pool money from depositors and then loan out a portion of it with interest. Both credit unions and banks do this, and both operate based on the fractional reserve concept. The only difference is credit unions are non-profits, which lets them have different priorities than banks.

I was going to post the same thing, but I saw you beat me to it. It's one thing to be optimistic, but the ease with which some people brush off all the crashes and volatility reminds me of Stockholm syndrome.

I can tell you straight away I know nothing about bitcoins, and that I had a specific reason for asking the question. Thank you and everyone else who took the time to respond. 
As for the ridiculousness of it, I saw multiple articles about the subject, such as  so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.
