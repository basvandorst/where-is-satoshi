When this guy first heard the term blockchain probably thought it was some new bling.

I use coinegg also and was not aware of the identity verification at first but should not be a big deal. Fairly certain coinegg was called something else before the exchange fiasco in china.

I believe this to be the most likely possibility but he assured me he had NEVER downloaded any wallet onto his pc and only used wallets on websites. Then again hes not the sharpest tool in the shed. Whats strange is that the transaction was sent at 2:00 AM the day before he left the country. Attempted to send not sure if it has been confirmed, again he MUST have downloaded Electrum before. I will let you know what happens. Thanks for the response.

Like Andreas says you Know the horse and buggy is still around. Thoughts on fiat backed by bitcoin?

Was wondering what ever happened to the BitSat project good to know the overall idea has been picked up by someone else.

Absolutely I remember sitting in high school economics and remember how as I was really beginning to learn what Bitcoin was all about creation of value was the topic in class so it all fell together nicely.
