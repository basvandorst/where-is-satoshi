I've been on twitter for quite a while. I never really amassed any followers though. I don't know who to tip or even how to tip on twitter. How should I get on board?

I'm glad I stuck around...This is getting good

Could the link be broken with a space to prevent botting? I now it sucks manually taking out the space after a copy paste...but would it be sufficient?

How are people tipping with links? Is this a new thing changetip did?
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:21:49
Not only did changetip introduce me to bitcoin, It changed the way I think in everyday situations. I even wanted to tip a random guy in the grocery line. Thank you guys, Awesome job.
