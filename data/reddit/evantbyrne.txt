I agree that proof of work wouldn't function well with sharding, which is one reason I'm optimistic for proof of stake. There will probably end up being staking pools, which could potentially result is less centralization than exists today with mining. We'll just have to see.


Well considering that a single ETH is worth 1/10 of a BTC, Ethereum handling roughly 1/2 the USD volume of Bitcoin in the past 24 hours seems pretty impressive to me. It eclipsing Bitcoin in USD volume is not out of the question.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:00:02
Kind of. Ethereum has a gas limit instead of block caps. Whenever things get super congested, people throw a fit and the miners generally adjust the limit.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:37:17
Even then it was around $0.55/tx. Not ideal, but a long shot from Bitcoin and there are on-chain scaling solutions that make sense like sharding and proof of stake in the works, which should give it even more leverage. The average BTC transaction last I checked was over $35 and was actually being celebrated by that guy with the awful beard over at Blockstream.

The Lightning Network team is an entirely separate group from the Bitcoin core team. It's a company, and decisions are unlikely based on "consensus".
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:27:33


The point of "sufficiently popular" differs a great deal based on implementation though. We know this for a fact because Ethereum handles more transactions at a tiny fraction of the Bitcoin fee. Highest I've personally seen for a safe transaction is $0.55. As of writing it's $0.02.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:37:31
If pushing 1.5 tx/s is all it takes to crush Bitcoin, then it's fundamentally broken.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:01:34
Yes. However that wouldn't apply to wallets with lost keys that can't get upgraded, right?
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:35:11
Ethereum has been handling more transactions than Bitcoin for a long time now, and the current safe fast transfer fee is under five cents.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:02:13


This is fair. It's not done yet, so skepticism is warranted. I've read the proposals, they make sense to me on a technical level, so I'm confident it will work.


This is completely false. Seriously just go look up metrics on this stuff. Ethereum handles way more transactions.


It did not break. Fees went up for a period of time to the numbers I mentioned because blocks were filling up. The gas limit has been adjusted as tends to happen.


Bitcoin has full blocks and higher fees every day.

Why should Coinbase be expected to implement SegWit before it even makes it into the official GUI wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:57:31
Thank you, I appreciate the response. What are the factors that could limit channel lifespan?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:56:35
Sure, but where this analogy falls apart is that you have to setup a new channel in order to add funds. Also there is risk associated with leaving large amounts of money locked in a channel. A monthly re-opening of a LN channel is not acceptable in my opinion with the current fee situation. Fees would have to go down in order to be competitive. We want long-running channels because of fees, but it's possible that the average person might not be able to lock up enough money to actually make an economic case for LN.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:26:59
Of course. I don't really consider Visa optimal though.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:32:22
What effect will full blocks have on security of funds within a channel? Will you be able to prevent a cheating lightning transaction if the Bitcoin transaction time is higher than the CLTV timeout?
Edited for clarity.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:53:49
There is probably be a technical reason for it. I'm pretty sure they already bundle withdrawals into massive multi-output transactions, and I've heard that they even cover withdrawal fees from GDAX. Given that people can't use SegWit in the GUI, it might not be perceived as a high priority when compared to other development tasks in the backlog.

First of all, you're talking to a guy that has a bunch of published open-source work. Teams doing volunteer dev work often do in fact have project managers. During my time at Code for Denver we certainly did. Secondly, they are an incorporated company that has job listings... But none for a project manager.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:10:10
Ethereum has an entire virtual machine that you can run arbitrary operations on. Whether you need to send money to multiple people at once and/or pool money together, it can be done in Ethereum. Growth of the blockchain in storage size is a natural consequence of it being used. Sharding will help with that significantly.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:53:23
Those aren't the only choices. They should have a calendar of well-defined milestones. But they don't, because they are an inexperienced team of academics that didn't know how to manage projects when they started on this. They don't even appear to have a project manager.

You have to wait for the channel to close before you actually have the BTC. With how high BTC fees are, that means people would realistically need long-running channels in order to actually save money over alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:46:44
This doesn't really address the primary concerns with lightning, so I'm a little confused as to what made you a believer. Everyone knows that lightning will have fast confirmations. The concerns include a security model that has not been fully tested, whether channels will actually end up connected like a mesh, channel open/close fees, closing channels with already full blocks, and having to wait potentially longer times than ACH to actually settle payment. It's cool that the testnet is running smoothly so far, but let's not get carried away.

@_date: 2018-01-06 18:39:26
Are there additional fees for opening and closing the channel?
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:56:55
Nobody really knows how long the average channel will stay open in practice, but with how high BTC fees are (over $35 last I checked) it just makes sense that you would need long-running channels in order to actually save money when compared to alternatives. I wouldn't consider it settled until the channel is closed and the BTC is safely in your wallet.

This is why no reasonable criminal would trust that money in an escrow account would ever actually get to him.
Beyond that, the hacker will have a copy of the scripts no matter what, so HBO wouldn't even benefit from doing this. If I were the hacker and HBO threw the money in an escrow account, I would do a partial public release of the scripts to force them to actually hand over the money. We are talking about ransom not a business deal between two parties that can leverage the court of law.

You don't need a hardware wallet. Encrypting the wallet files with AES 256 GCM is enough. You can then backup those wallet files to any number of places (like Google Drive and Dropbox) for safe keeping without needing to worry about someone being able to see them. Just be sure that you can remember your password, decrypt and use the files, and then remove the unencrypted copies from your computer.

You mean with a debit card I'm guessing? It's 1.4% or less generally and are approved almost instantly, as apposed to Bitcoin's high tx fee plus long wait time. I can actually use a debit card for everyday purchases. Wire transfers are a few dollars if done through your actual bank. Checks are also still a useful method of paying large bills as well. If someone steals my wallet and buys a boat, I'll almost certainly get that money back. Say what you want about fiat currency, but banks are pretty darn convenient.

I don't have any recommendations for Bitcoin wallets in particular, because I've been trading pretty continually since I've gotten my Bitcoin. The official wallet would likely be a good place to start. My primary recommendation would be to keep the wallet on a clean computer (i.e., fresh OS install, don't install unnecessary programs on it, don't use it for other stuff). Also you would want to make encrypted off-site backup of the wallet. Shit's annoying as fuck, right?

You just handle the situation on the rare occasion that it arises and dispute bs claims. Returns can happen in person regardless of currency being used. If shipping, then you should have a verifiable trail of evidence showing that the buyer has your item. This isn't an issue with cryptocurrency simply because there's no system of fraud prevention at all. You just have to cross your fingers and hope the person you just sent money to is going to ship your item to you.

The implementation for OpenSSL is a lot more transparent that some proprietary hardware wallet. If you follow the steps I outlined, then your wallet will be safer than almost all other wallets out there. If you are worried about being compromised at the time of wallet creation, then do a clean OS install. And if that isn't good enough for you, setup and encrypt the wallet on a fresh linux virtual machine. If you can't trust that kind of setup, then I'm curious as to how you think people should go about getting their Bitcoin in the first place lol.

This is a weird myth. As an outside observer of this whole thing, I have witnessed discussion of other potential optimizations to the codebase. I believe proof-of-work introduces some fundamental limits that both codebases will run into eventually, but right now increasing the block size is a pretty obvious optimization for BTC...
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:56:46
No you can not. Bitcoin transactions are inherently traceable. All a government has to do is trace your transaction chain back to an exchange account to identify you. The only way to have truly anonymous Bitcoin transactions is by either mining your own coins or buying them on the black market with a less traceable currency (and then of course not giving up identifying information in the process of making follow-up purchases). As we have seen with dark web busts, mixers simply do not work on a public blockchain.

No, disincentivize people from adding 500% markup every step of the chain. You simply can't force the government to provide healthcare long-term without also regulating costs.
Also, have you ever tried paying for healthcare out of pocket? The hospitals will bill you some outrageous number, then you tell them you won't pay it a bunch of times, and it magically becomes a tenth of the original cost. And it's still way overpriced. So many people are put into debt slavery from that bullshit. Even if we choose not to nationalize healthcare, we need stomp down hard on entities that do that shit.

I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.

Thank you for the information! Do you know of any estimations on how much the proposed block size increase would effect full node resource consumption?

Are you sure? I'm interested in your thought process, because "We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin." sounds like a mining race to me.

Bullshit. I timed the market and made 40% in a single day three weeks ago. You don't have to know exactly when the dip happens. What's important is having a clear idea of what margins you are dealing with, knowing the underlying technology is sound, and determining if the people controlling the asset have their shit together.

Well credit cards are approved or denied immediately, which is important when doing POS transactions. Yes you are correct the settlements can take a while though. There is also a risk of chargeback. I was mostly referring to how slow Bitcoin transaction times are compared to other coins.

FOMO-ing at the ATH on an extremely volatile asset is not the trait of a typical successful investor. You are supposed to buy _before_ the price goes on a parabolic bull run.

I honestly don't understand why core is so against increasing the block size from a technical perspective. Can someone point me to a technical analysis? Not looking to debate either way, just to learn. I'm neither invested in BTC nor any of its recent forks. Thank you!

Please tell me you are joking... Bitcoin transactions can take over an hour to go through. There is a crazy amount of drama on how to scale the network. Glorious leader probably died of a heart attack. There are plenty of reasons for a risk averse individual to pass on the opportunity.

And by that you mean you bought your own insurance or just simply not undergoing serious treatment? Get in an accident and the hospital can take your life saving for a couple weeks of treatment. It's not a free market if your life is on the line.
I have always paid for my shit, but I've also been through real poverty and understand the limitations of the libertarian dream. Go fuck yourself shallow bitch. Keep sucking off those core devs in hopes they'll make you rich, since that's all you care about.

Yup. Made my buy at 7:40 AM September 15th @ $206 per ETH.

Blockchain isn't going away. What happens with Bitcoin if forks continue to be this dramatic though? What if the hour+ transaction issue gets even worse under load? I honestly think Bitcoin has more upwards movement in it, but I don't know how much that particular codebase can really scale.

Fucking around with farmers is a pretty surefire way to kill off your working class. Also see Lysenkoism in Soviet Russia, the Great Leap Forward in Communist China, and the colonial practices of the British Empire within Ireland and India.

The problem is that most non-profits waste the majority of their funds on things like advertising and salaries. Giving labor and funds when necessary to local causes that you can monitor is the way to do it.

Thankfully I'm always super careful with this stuff. I even sign a consent form before touching myself.
