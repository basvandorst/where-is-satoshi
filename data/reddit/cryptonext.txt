Our platform is decentralized in so far as any exchange platform with fiat currencies can be:  If any exchange in the network were to fall into financial problems, it would not jeopardize the account holders' funds as they are not controlled by the individual exchange.
Inevitably, all automated exchanges dealing with fiat currencies have some centralization, as money needs to be held by someone, but we aim to spread this as much as possible by using several banking services.  
Additionally, since we are incorporated in the Isle of Man, it is a legal requirement that bank accounts are controlled by a Corporate Services Provider, therefore a third party safeguards the fiat currencies at all times.

After the 20th December, you will only be able to buy CXC on a second-hand basis, as we will be cutting off the supply.  
Activities across the platform are tied to CXC so, as the network grows, the use of CXC will inevitably increase, and with it demand for the coin.  We estimate that one CXC will be valued at $1.00 after the 20th December, based on the value of an average transaction fee, therefore we believe that early buyers of the token can expect a prompt value increase.  
Since all CXC tokens will be held by those who have acquired them before the 20th December 2014, supply will be limited whilst demand should increase so holders of CXC may also benefit from an additional increase in value in the long term.

Our belief is that the key to mainstream adoption of digital currencies such as bitcoin is global access; therefore exchanges need to exist in all currencies, locations and languages, which is exactly what we offer.  
We believe exchanges can be as widespread as money exchangers, bank branches, money remitters, etc., of which there are hundreds of thousands worldwide - so there is plenty of room in the market.  
We are able to service multiple locations not just with multiple languages and currencies, but because we will integrate as many different banking facilities in as many locations as we can, to make deposits and withdrawals as easy and as cheap as possible.

Currently, we have: USD, Euro, GBP, Bulgarian Lev, Czech Koruna, Hungarian Forint, Lithuanian Litas (changing to Euro in 2015), Romanian New Leu, Turkish Lira, Polish Zloty.  
We are adding Central and South American currencies via AstroPay, and are also starting to work with Africa, which will inevitably mean some local currencies from African countries.

We plan on listing everything!  Each white label operator has the option of choosing the currencies and markets they would like to offer on their own exchange.  We are already working on integrating Mastercoin and Next, and will of course add Counterparty and any additional 2.0 assets.

Subject to KYC approval, anyone can open an exchange and tailor it to their needs at very little cost.  We advise anybody who is interested to contact us directly, or to go to  open an account and take a look around the system.

Security is of paramount importance to Crypto Next, and we adhere to strict KYC requirements in accordance with Isle of Man regulations.  The system is automated so that KYC procedures can be performed as quickly as possible without compromising on security.
You first need to create an account on  complete your details, upload your KYC documents and press the button to request activation of the White Label (WL) control panel. Once we have checked your information, we will contact you and ask for proof of domain name ownership and - if you have a company - the Certificate of Incorporation and the Memorandum of Articles of the company.  We will then open the WL panel, order a SSL certificate, and can have your exchange live in about one hour.

I am closing the live AMA session in 5 minutes, but will check for new questions every day or so.

Same answer as to "How will I know that the coins have been destroyed?"
KPMG are a reputable audit firm and they will keep track of the CXC.
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:06:35
A – We believe we offer several advantages:
1. Subject to vetting, we can have your exchange live in about one hour.
2. We can save you the trouble of opening a bank account or setting up a company, which can be time consuming and expensive.
3. We offer multiple fiat and digital currencies, and languages.
4. We allow you to add your own coin to the network, and additional languages as required.
5. We allow you to set your own fees and only take a 25% cut of that amount.
6. You can tailor the system design and features you wish to include to your needs.
7. We offer a high level of security.
8. You enjoy the legal and regulatory framework offered by the Isle of Man.
9. We provide a system whereby anyone with an existing community can start earning money almost immediately.
10. We are working on adding features such as merchant payment processing, money remittance and mobile apps which will be included in the WL package.
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:08:12
Absolutely!  This is one of our most popular features.  Any white label operator can add any coin and any language to the system, working with our technical team.  In fact, for those providing a new language translation, we will waiver the activation fee for their white label exchange.

If you mean "how does having an exchange on the Crypto Next platform provide advantages over other existing platforms", the answer is that you would be able to provide your users with:
- Multiple languages
- Multiple fiat and digital currencies
- Friendly UI
- High level of security
Importantly, you can set your own commission fees, so there is the potential for an advantage there too.
If you mean "do the exchange operators on our platform have any advantages over others on the platform", then the answer is "no".  We do not favor one WL exchange operator over another.  The only advantage you could have is if you register a new language or currency, and are the first person to offer it, but there is nothing stopping another exchange from adding it.

Unlike some other coins, CXC has a real world application and is already being purchased, traded and used on existing platforms.  We expect its value to increase almost immediately after the 20th December, as well as in the long term.  Whilst we do not promise a value increase of 500% and we do not claim CXC will change the world, we propose that it is a solid conservative purchase with a realistic value increase projection.
Wishing you happy holidays :)

No, you don't. We look after all the licensing.  If we find that our Isle of Man incorporated company needs to have licenses, we will get them as long as the costs are not prohibitive.  Obviously, the bitcoin world has an ever changing regulatory landscape, and staying on top of this is one of the unique services we offer.  To pay for this, and other development, we are starting a fundraising exercise from tomorrow onwards, starting with presenting to the BitAngels network.

Thanks to everyone for your intelligent and thoughtful questions!

A Crypto Next Coin (CXC) is a fee token that is used across Crypto Next platforms in a number of ways: 
1.  One CXC can be used in lieu of paying a percentage transaction fee across all Crypto Next powered exchanges (regardless of the trade volume), with the aim of making transactions cheaper and easier for end users. 
2. White label (WL) activation fees are charged in CXC, thus people will need to obtain CXC in order to activate their WL exchange. 
3. The 25% on commissions that we charge is automatically converted to CXC, thus increasing the demand for CXC as the volume of trades goes up across the WL platforms.
Crypto Next Coins are available for purchase on any of our exchanges, including our own:   Until the 20th of December they can be bought for 0.001 BTC per CXC, or USD 0.35 each, or Euro 0.29 each.  After the 20th of December, any remaining coins will be destroyed in order to limit the supply of CXC to those who have purchased them already, and people who have been paid in CXC during the development of the project.
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:40:06
We are adding all 2.0 platforms and as such any assets created on those platforms will automatically be added to our system.
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:19:24
Crypto Next has appointed KPMG as company auditors.  CXC will be listed as an asset in our accounts and will be audited by KPMG to the standard of any other currency.  Therefore CXC owners are assured that the CXC amounts recorded will be accurate.

We are trying to encourage as many exchanges as possible to join the network, so have made the fees as low as possible - the idea is that anyone looking to start an exchange would not think twice about using us.  
Opening an exchange with us right now should cost little more than normal running costs; and significantly less than developing the software, implementing security measures, adhering to legalities, sourcing banking services etc.  
Specifically, the activation fee is currently only 500 Crypto Next Coins (which can be bought on any of our exchanges and translates to about $200).  The hosting fee for an exchange is about $100- $150 per month depending on the number of languages and coins selected.  Finally, we have an ongoing charge of 25% of the trading commission, which is set by the operator of the exchange.

The Isle of Man has has an excellent global reputation as a financial hub and has always been at the forefront of financial innovation.  The government holds a positive stance towards bitcoin and digital currency businesses, and is aiming to become the "bitcoin isle" of the world.
