based on?.. oh yes, wild speculation, which is what got us into this madness to begin with.

Whether this was in the original ToS or not, I find it a pretty dodgy practice. Generally speaking you would think they would encourage you to leave money/BTC in the account, that certaintly increases the likelihood that you will make future trades. I was under the impression that Cavirtex was in the exchange business, where they provide a trade platform and make money on trade commissions. Having funds in the account is consistent with that business model IMHO.

It did? Their website and login seems fully functional.

Well whether they are scammers or not, the fact that they are not being transparent as to the reason for withdrawal delay is unacceptable.

Visa is wobbing. from TF:
Update July 4: Visa Europe told us that it “has not been involved in this matter in any way, and has not made any such stipulations to Payson or to any other organisation.” It is unclear whether the request could have come from another Visa office.
We have asked Payson to clarify the discrepancy and will update the article when we hear back from them.
Mastercard has not responded yet.
