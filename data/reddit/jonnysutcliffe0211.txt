This is actually the most average dip, you must have not been here more than 2 weeks

peeped your post history, do you spend all your time being a dick on this sub?

“Whining about my personal dilemma” is a nice way of saying “Asking for advice on a bitcoin subreddit”. Also a ton of other people are asking the exact same thing... How the fuck u manage to get an ego about BITCOIN man.. People ask questions, you don’t have to be rude. Next time, you can just say “I would recommend just holding your coins because it is the safer option” instead of being a pompous ass.

I sincerely apologize for being a newb and asking a question politely.  Please forgive me, all knowing bitcoin internet stranger,  “common decency” isn’t a thing for someone who has no patience for questions, yet spends their time commenting smug comments on every possibly silly question asked on this subreddit.

Bro this is a great thought and comment and all, but do you really have to put it on every single post

 Would wait, the market seems inflated for now, probably will be a dip soonish
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:24:27
Everyone here is going to say buy, but the price just shot up 500 dollars in a day... I would definitely wait for a dip.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:48:15
Not what I was saying at all, just asking if anyone thought there would be a hefty dip soon to reinvest..

nope I just look at the new posts and I’ve seen this comment like 4 times
