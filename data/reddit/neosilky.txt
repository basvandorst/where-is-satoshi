Hey! Thanks for this! :D

From my experience, it allows people to access your sdcard or emulated storage. App storage is typically in the phone memory which is protected. You don't have root so that is fine. :)

Like 0.015. I was unable to buy them when they were £8 and it sucks :(
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:30:37
I live in the UK - my problem is that I can't get Bitcoins lower than ~3% commission on their actual value anyway. 
So a 1% commission on top of their market value would be a loss to me and 1% on top of the premium I paid would be ~ 4% premium for my buyer.
Any ideas? There are a whole lot more opportunities to buy cheaper outside of the UK.
EDIT: At the time of this edit, [this site]( lists the cheapest as 2.5% premium.

Hey, thanks for this!
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:36:35
Anymore left? :D Thanks man!
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:14:12
Woah man, you're very kind!
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:28:37
I've just bought some at a 2% premium, not bad at all!
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:41:20
This is great! Good job man!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:48:04
Goddammit, I wish I could say this!
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:50:45
Goddammit this is hard, I'm not really this kind of thinker unless it's more of a logical problem than thinking outside the box
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:00:56
Nope, I *COULD* do it, but I just have other things on!
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:17:57
Check their Twitter!
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:17:10
No, they are currently upgrading their servers, as I said!
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:35:25
That looks pretty cool, I will keep an eye on this!
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:45:43
I would love to buy some but there is no easy way of doing it at all :(
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:46:26
I think if people are tipping another Redditor with Bitcoins, they expect it to go to that person, not disappear into someones wallet.
I think you should also look up about mining, I'm not sure you fully understand.
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:26:10
Which bits? A lot of it is already filled in, you just need your mining hash rate and power consumption and cost rate!
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:55:59
Thanks man, I'll try this out later but I'll PM you if I have problems!
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:24:56
Yep, I was just about to say this!
Also, the thing to remember is not to invest more than you can afford to lose!
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:10:39
It'd be great to do this!
Maybe:   
- The obvious bitcoin 'coin' designs   
- 'I'm a bitcoiner'    
- An infographic into bitcoins [LIKE THIS](

If the thread was deleted, it might of been because the poster deleted it or a moderator/bot picked it up.
Your command in your post would basically send 0.5 bitcoins to the parent poster, probably the original poster and the verify means the bitcointip bot would post a comment saying it's been accepted!
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:39:44
I'd love to be able to afford to buy some Bitcoins but I know that I can't. I'm just going to have to wait for any jobs or donations for when I make something that help the community.
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:53:22
I use Blockchain.info and I've never really noticed slowness at all. Sure they've had downtime but they were upgrading their servers.
They also have a pretty cool app for on the travel usage!
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:06:21
So what will you be doing with this? Giving it away, holding out until it goes up etc?
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:51:03
I'm not sure, you'll have to check the documentation. Either way, you could try and accept it, if it fails, it won't be able to accept nothing!
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:11:01
Fine fine fine, I'll have a look later ;)
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:57:29
No problem, best of luck with Bitcoins and remember to spread the word/love!
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:58:26
You should make some bitcoin related t-shirts and accept bitcoins for payment!
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:22:44
Bitcointip is a bot on Reddit and it allows people to send Bitcoins from their account to another account, normally another Redditor that's done well or done something they like!
@_date: 2013-03-30 12:12:27
Goddamnit, I wish I had the enthusiasm to do this
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:06:30
How about a browser extension with interaction to the Facebook layout?
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:34:02
Okay so I've never used Coinbase before but I'm guessing you can export your wallet to somewhere. If you then go into Blockchain, you can import your wallet and then proceed to use it on there!
As far as securing goes, Blockchain is great. You can set two passwords, two factor authentication and IP locking.
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:21:33
Goddammit I've been sitting here for ages, can we get a clue?
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:48:01
Anybody got any good ideas for the UK?
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:21:29
I might just do that and slowly invest into it!
@_date: 2013-03-13 07:28:58
Do they use Cloudflare or some other type of protection?
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:08:34
Whilst one side can be anonymity, you can always just make another address and use that as your 'public one'
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:07:58
Yep, something like that!
You could easily throw some Javascript together to add the icons next to your Facebook pictures.
You could also define a BTC address and sync it with a web server which references your account so people can send you it even if they don't have your address.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:31:22
Damnit, I wish I could afford a pebble! :(
@_date: 2013-03-10 13:21:39
That's pretty fricking awesome!
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:22:27
Looks good, I might apply for that website design job!
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:34:22
Well done fellow Redditor, you are such a kind person!
I would tip you but I don't have enough :3
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:02:35
Here is the desktop version of their website [CLICK ME] (
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:14:35
I know you can convert BTC to LTC but the little amount of BTC I have, I'd like to keep them.
I find it hard to even buy BTC. No banks near me provide such services to convert cash and all online methods seem to be for other countries!
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:21:46
The instructions are in but you basically have to PM the bot and accept the donation.
The poster might of broken the rules etc. or it might of just got taken down.
I meant your """"""+bitcoin*** 0.5 etc."""""" I didn't want to post it incase the bot thought I was trying to send you 0.5BTC! :P
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:42:33
(or do this!)
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:57:16
Well I'd like to solve it and me and my girlfriend are sitting here staring at it!
Oh well, maybe I'm not good enough :3
