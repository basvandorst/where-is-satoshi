Its in my understanding that your provider might be blocking tor connections.  For more help please post your issue in the bisq forums

Sorry, the CEO and owner of Binance, CZ short for his name

What you say sounds like a better idea. 
The time-lock should be pre-approved only by CZ for example before any amount of that magnitude goes out.
Maybe CZ has thought of it though i dont know, maybe you should ask him directly to find out.

no one wants to mess with them? lmao calm down please.. The FBI and CIA get attempted hacks on their **own** systems every single day.
And yes of course i agree that its almost always an inside job.  Coinbase is by far the biggest exchange. The bigger the exchange the longer it takes to co-ordinate a simultaneous attack. Just wait... their turn will come, whether they think they have their asses covered or not. American hackers are not little angels either and they aren't afraid to pass on a message to their friend from the other side of the world.
The trick is to keep your coins OFF the exchange.

If this is the case, Craig can try all he wants to crack the Truecrypt volumes, but he won't succeed - ever. So let him cry like a little bitch.
Nevertheless - It wouldn't matter if Le Roux was Satoshi (even though he is an evil genius crime boss) - if its true, then he created and set in motion the best thing known to the digital age that can never be stopped.

Dude, do yourself a favor and chuck armory wallet in the fucking bin. In the past i had ongoing issues and bugs weren't being fixed(and i wasnt the only one). yes you need bitcoind in the background, but whats the point if you can just run bitcoin-qt rather(which runs bitcoind in the background FOR YOU) ?

ok look, Armory Wallet does not "just connect" and you receive and send coins.  It uses bitcoind (a fully downloaded node, which takes about 2 days to sync depending on your internet connection) and then armory connects to that.
If you instead use Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-qt) - that will do the same thing, but it will run bitcoind in the background FOR YOU. again it will take about 2 days to sync.
I suggest you download and use greenwallet [
Unless you want to wait for the full node to sync, then use Bitcoin Core [
However your bitcoins are not lost.  Just sweep your armory wallet private keys first and then import them in another wallet of your choice. So im just suggesting an alternative to armory wallet because armory wallet is complicated and full of bugs.
