Aaah but you’ve forgotten a fundamental part of the Tax code... income generated even off illegal activity requires taxes to be paid off of it.
The IRS just wants its money.  They leave legality of the “business” up to other agencies.
Think Al Capone

Wesley Snipes had a way of avoiding taxes... for a while.... you might not want to follow in his foot steps.
Look, you’re going to pay one way or the other.  Being honest up front means you pay and that’s it.  Trying to defraud the government will incur penalties and interest and prison time.  That’s gonna cost you a lot more in the long run.
You decide.

Cash out and wire transfer the whole amount to your bank account.  
Easy peasy lemon squeezie...
You absolutely don’t want to “transfer smaller amounts so as to stay under the 10,000 reporting limit”.  Just by doing that alone you’re committing a felony even if the money was obtained completely legally.  It’s called “structuring”.
Transfer it all at once and enjoy the profit after taxes

When you file your taxes on April 15th you’ll put some of your income as “capital gains” in the “capital gains” box on your tax forms.  You’ll then see a “you owe the government 20% of this amount” and you’ll send in a check along with your tax forms on April 15th

No questions at all.  Super simple paper transaction.  Just because the “currency” is crypto, doesn’t mean the money magically appears in your account.  The bank and government know where it came from and happily tax you on the gains

20% is the top long term capital gains rate
