I got it working by reading 
Summed up, I had to delete some crap in appdata then download a huge 4.5gb bootstrap.dat file and put it in there.

OK guys, Thanks for the responses. I left Bitcoin open while I slept and the blockchain still hasn't downloaded. Afaik, I am using the most up to date version of Bitcoin (v0.8.0-beta). Attached is a screenshot of the program 
Remember: I started the program after it installed and the block chain never STARTED to download. No progress bar on the bottom of the program like everyone else gets their first time running bitcoin. Also: Notice how my wallet is out of synch. Proof in my mind that my machine isn't getting ANY of the blockchain.
I guess what y'all are saying is, I'll have to manually download the blockchain to my C:\Documents and Settings\XXXXX\Application Data\Bitcoin directory? I don't feel safe doing this. This user is having the EXACT problem I am having  Sadly that was over a month ago and nobody responded to him.

I stand corrected.  It stopped downloading the blockchain again...

xp has some functionality that vista and 7 does not.  Functionality that I require.  No protection, I ride bareback.

Come on someone must be able to help me...  I downloaded the latest bootstrap i could find again and manually updated the blockchain.  After updating from disk it is stuck at 95.87%
I still have 8 active connections.  So confused.
