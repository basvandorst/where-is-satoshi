Not out of the woods yet, sadly.

@_date: 2018-01-16 15:06:47

@_date: 2018-01-16 15:03:22

I can't wait for this to bite you on the ass.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:37:13
Hate to break it to you but you are trying too hard.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:04:17
Exactly. You are a gambler who sees this as free cash. And lay off the coffee then man, you need to relax in this game or you will lose heavy amounts of money.

I really do hope you are young.. if not, you have no hope.

I am completely aware of that; just your response is ignorant and childish. Nothing to do with jealousy, or me 'BEING MAD BRO! XD' - my issue is people running in blindly and throwing money at Bitcoin with no awareness of the volatility of the current state, or the upcoming state. It frustrates me people are taking such a huge risk without realising such risk. The one thing I hate more than that, who I genuinely hope Bitcoin does fail for, are people like you who are arrogant and condescending.

Honestly, this will get really, really volatile. Way too stressful for me as an investor who likes to keep an eye on his investments.

BTC is due a huge crash. New hands FOMO buying will panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:27:46
Market is stupidly volatile at the moment. And ignore ANYONE who claims to know where this thing is going.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:06:44
Hopefully you aren't just saying that and won't be upset if this all goes tits up. Goodluck!

Seen about 4 posts by him in 5 minutes spouting complete shit. Seems like a prime example of an investor knowing nothing about what they are getting into, and a perfect example of why the price will crash.

you are right! eventually people will come out of the denial that we are still in a bull market. free money though!
