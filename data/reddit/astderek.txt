The thing is that a small portion of one of the groups assumes about the whole other group. So *some* MtGox lovers told scolded you, now you are telling everybody to *shut up and move*.
It seems to me that persons from both sides are angry at the wrong persons.

Mt. GOX went bankrupt! HTTPS is a ponzi scheme!

Maybe lighting was the problem, I tried with the full image

People need to learn how to use a cryptocurrency, using some *risk-free*  alternative is a good option IMO, you'd just need to point out that it is for testing.
Here, your assumption is that people would think: *"hey, if this is for testing purposes, any other cryptocurrency will be, thus is fake!"*.

This is like flamewars. Why aren't you talking about the problems involved if such system was adopted?
*"This guy is bad, therefore what he wants to do is bad"* — fallacy.
Besides that, who will comply to such service?

My ISP resets my IP when I restart the router, can you try something similar?

Why not only refuse to participate in such structure? If vendors started accepting bitcoins just because they wanted, they can as well accept bitcoins that have not been *coinvalidated*.
What am I missing here?

Welcome to OP will be your guide

Well, the point is valid, take people to a *safe* environment where their money is not at risk while they make sense of the exchange system/mechanics, yet you think people will judge the whole system as invalid due a mere logo, which is as invalid as my example.
No wonder why this sub feels so rigid against newcomers.

You are right, scanned from URL worked fine, I was trying to read it directly from screen

I am quite ignorant too. I'm not fond of these posts because they don't help me or others to understand the situation.
A constructive discussion would be like this one:

*"Repent from your sins"* — you forgot that part

Don't tell me you are waiting for Walmart to accept bitcoins to start using them.
Anyway, posting a *meme*-like image will stop Walmart from doing it?
Informing people about the negative aspects of such system will have a more positive impact than just ranting around.

She asked a question yet she's right? Cool story, bro.

I'll check it out, thanks!

I understand you don't comprehend what I'm saying. If you want to move along those lines, consider posting at @_date: 2013-09-19 01:22:08
This is the misleading part:

I received the [same email]( but I don't use CampBX.
Even if you create a unique alias for your account, it travels unencrypted through the net. These guys harvested emails from some other source and are trying to profit from it.

Care to explain a lot more please?
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:45:26
You should change this wording: *"If you want a refund, please contact us directly ..."* as stated by edit: page updated, thnx tharlam

You are right, we should also take away fake money from monopoly, people won't take money seriously after that!
