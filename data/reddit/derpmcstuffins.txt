I'm as against the taxes as anyone else, but trying to dodge your tax system is just not a smart idea. You're really asking for so much trouble.
I'd rather not get my wages garnished or go to jail just to stick it to the Man. I'll just pay my taxes and complain about it.

Exactly. I'm not sure where the idea came from that, in order to support someone, you have to agree with 100% of what they say and do. If that was the case, there would be no one on earth that I support, including myself sometimes :D

Can't even log in to Coinbase at the moment...

I've been considering a Casa node a lot recently. The convenience seems like it might be a good solution to running a full node without having to keep my desktop node up all the time (I dual boot and don't want to resync all the time and run so intermittently).
What are your thoughts, OP? Would you recommend Casa's Node?

Heck yeah

I'm pretty sure it's because sportsbet.io sponsors Watford FC now, and they're a betting site that uses Bitcoin. Great for general Bitcoin awareness if you ask me!
Edit: eh, read your comment wrong. It would be awesome if businesses started using Bitcoin to pay ads! One day...

Ok, great.
One more question if you don't mind :)
Do you have some process automated to buy on a regular interval through Coinbase Pro? Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see a repeat buy option in Pro... Or do you just go in and manually buy on an interval?

Loving these metal wallets!
This will be my third series (including LTC and ETH)... can't wait to get one of these in my hands too!
I've loaded most. But even unloaded, they're a really fun way to add some crypto art to my desk. :)

Umm... Not sure if this is /s or not... they definitely let you send them to another address. Just get a Ledger or something and send them over. Done.

Makes sense. Thanks for the responses!

Do you transfer your coins out to a more private wallet or do you store in Coinbase? (I'm putting a simple DCA plan together, so I'm looking for tips)
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:23:24
This one, guys. This is the one.

I'm a simple man; just minding my own business, stacking my sats while the government ruins the monetary system.
