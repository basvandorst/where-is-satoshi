If you buy $100 worth of BTC - the value increases to $200 - you then decide to take that extra $100 worth of BTC and by ETH with it.  The BTC for ETH transaction is taxable.  So while most feel that only crypto &gt; fiat should be taxable - the IRS says crypto &gt; crypto is taxable as well.

Did you order directly from Trezor?

I do not believe so - whatever method you choose - you must use for the entire year (for claiming taxes)....I am pretty sure (someone correct me if I am wrong) - that you cannot choose different methods for different transactions or different currencies.

Thanks. I regret not handling this last night.  Just didn't anticipate that 2 hrs wouldn't be enough time to get my btc to kucoin before the snapshot.

Thanks - I thought maybe the bottleneck was people doing exactly what I was doing - which was moving btc from exchanges that were not crediting btc holders with btcp - to exchanges that were.  But it's almost 7 hours since the snapshot and still no progress.

FIFO is the most common method.  
For more info - check out these sites that do portfolio tracking and help with tax reporting.

When you use BTC to buy an alt - you don't get to "choose" for each trade - which BTC is used for the purchase.  The most recognized way to track profit/loss (and recognized by the IRS) is using the FIFO method (first in / first out).
This means - if you bought BTC 3x. 
The first time the value of BTC was 7k.  
Then next time it was 7.5k
3rd time it was 8k
Then you decide to use BTC to buy an alt - you would be using the BTC you purchased FIRST (this would be the BTC that was "first in" so it would  then be the "first out")
So in your case - you bought $10 of BTC - then bought another $5 of BTC so you can buy an alt - the BTC "used" for that alt buy is the BTC that was the "first in" which is the value when you bought $10 worth. 
You can use the LIFO method (last in / first out) which means the BTC you purchased last is the BTC you use to make your alt purchase.  This is recognized by the IRS but the FIFO method is the most widely recognized and used.  In either case - whatever method you choose you must choose for ALL your trades during the year.  You can't  choose FIFO for one trade and LIFO for another.  
While trying to determine which method serves you best - keep in mind that while using the LIFO method may benefit you based on the value of BTC at the time - potentially your "last in" BTC may be considered a short term gain where your "first in" BTC may show a bigger gain based on BTC value but may have a smaller tax consequence if it's considered a long term gain (over one year). 
Hope this helps.

I don't believe this can be done with Trezor wallet.

No.....you must use the same for ALL your trades during the year.  While you can change from one year to the next - you can't choose for each trade.
