I don't know. Maybe it was more 2010 then. I just remember being told about it, and I saw that it was sometimes worth 6 cents, sometimes 8, etc. To me, it didn't sound stable and I didn't want it (for purchase).  I wanted to give it a shot by mining when I wasnt playing games, but I was always playing games, and never got around to even looking up how to do it.

That's pretty much the definition of deflation.
It's the reason why deflation is generally a bad thing, because people tend to hold their money instead of spend it... which is bad for the economy.
Of course, the way the governments and the top holders of fiat are acting aren't helping anything.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:22:31
Do you use cash? 
Yes, I occasionally do use cash still.  
How much cash do you have?
That's personal, I'd rather not discuss my finances.
Seriously, don't worry about telling people you use Bitcoin. You want to let it slide off like it's normal, you're just another person that uses Bitcoin. Don't hide it.
Its the prying into your money that's that issue, not Bitcoin. So when they then ask how much, just respond with something like "how much do you have in your bank account. /S" 
Let people know it's ok to use Bitcoin, but that just like anything else, asking how much is a personal matter similar to cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:13:09
I don't talk about my Bitcoin with anyone anymore either. If they ask about it, in general terms, I will talk. But I won't bring it up.
If I purchase a stock through my IRA, no one bats an eye. But if I buy some Bitcoin, suddenly everyone is a financial guru.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:25:46
Yeah. I forgot how slow it was. I bought some bitcoin on 11/24 to lock in the price, and was told it would take 7 days. I also did a transfer of USD simply so it'd be on hand so I'd be ready if a dip happened soon. The estimate was 4 days. I don't really expect it until next week, either.

Where I live, I can create accounts at different exchanges, but Coinbase is the only place I can actually buy with fiat. I dont much trust local bitcoins... On top of the fact that there's ways a huge premium there AND Coinbase is far more convenient. Basically, coinbase/Gdax are the only online exchanges I can use to buy. But I can trade elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:02:56
That's a good question.
On average, a new block is mined every 10 minutes, and so it takes about 10 minutes for confirmations to happen after you trade or move bitcoins. What this means is that if you buy bitcoins, or move them to another account, it'll take AT LEAST 10 minutes before the transaction is officially complete. Though it takes several confirmations before the bitcoins are fully usable again. But that is completely separate from anything to do with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:17:39
And yet, it's basically the only option available to a lot of people, unfortunately. Not necessarily the ONLY option, but might as well be in some cases.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:46:11
I don't understand.... Gdax doesn't own coins. You are buying coins from other people.
Coinbase is more of a possibility, but they charge a premium in part because they will essentially be buying it themselves through Gdax instantly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:13
Sure... But some people do. it's not hard to believe you'd find someone who knew of it.  I knew about it in 2009. But I didn't want it either. I liked the idea, but it was too volatile for me to use.

And the news likely only talks about the crash, and how the price of Bitcoin is now at the lowest price it reached, but says NOTHING about the recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:03:59
That's how Bitcoin works. It skyrockets, then crashes, then levels out, repeat. Or maybe it levels out, crashes, the skyrockets, repeat. 
There's always a crash. You just don't know when, for how long, or how much.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:53:10
As others mentioned.... You're right and wrong.  There's a benefit to simply trusting a credit card company that can take care of the transaction instantly, and not screw you over later.  Of course cash can have similar benefits, but cash can't be used online in the same way.
On the other hand, credit card transactions can go south on ya, months after the transaction. Bitcoin is permanent, which still.... Can be good or bad.
That being said, this "lightening" network could help that.

The other day I renewed my car registration. If you go to the DMV in person, you get charged $5 extra(cash is accepted). But you can do it online to avoid that fee. But this year, there is a new online system. One that charges $3 minimum in fees to use. Extra if you use credit card.

I asked my dad yesterday if he had heard of Bitcoin.  "Yes."
I then asked if he had purchased any since he enjoys investing in the market.  He told me no, it was too risky.  I said I thought the same thing back in 2011 when it was less than $1.
Same as you, realistically I would have pulled out at some point because 1) I had no money back then (this not even being able to purchase) and 2) I didn't like having to keep track of all the different places my money was.

Eh.  It makes sense.  People buying in so they can acquire "free" BCoinCash, yet still, others see the price increase and think it's a good time to sell before the "split." Neither is so particularly convincing as to change prices too significantly.

This is the proper way to think of things.  Your OP is a statement I hear a lot, but doesn't get the right message across.  Because, of course, ANYTHING we spend our money on, fiat OR crypto, could always be put someplace else and have potential gains.  It didn't matter if that person bought that pizza with Bitcoin or fiat.
However, one might even say that it was more beneficial to purchase using Bitcoin, because it reinforced it's use, and helped make Bitcoin what it is worth today.  Had that pizza not been bought, the price may never have gotten this high.

I think they are using wrong terminology here. Access to wallets isn't as important as access to an exchange that can be used when it comes to buying/selling. Even if someone had their own keys, they can't buy or sell if they can't get to an exchange they can use. And not all exchanges are available to everyone in the same capacity.

Miners aren't some elite few that deserve a bonus because they are mining for our benefit. They are in it for the money. They find profit in one form or another, and usually have methods of decreasing their costs that allow them to mine more efficiently than Joe Blow in his studio apartment.  If miners needed some "bonus" to stay in the business, they would have left long ago.
And if the big players leave, the difficulty in mining decreases, allowing more people like Joe Blow to step in instead, because suddenly it is more economical for him to mine. A new equilibrium will be found.
In fact, the fewer big players and the more individuals that can mine, the better. The goal is to stay decentralization. So no, miners absolutely should not be paid any more than the bare minimum.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:27:26
That’s really good, no matter how you look at it.
I bought some at $6,200, knowing I’d buy more if it dropped again. I did notice when it hit around $5,700, but didn’t buy because I was half asleep after work. By the time I remembered, it was too late. And to be honest, I was ready to put down a good chunk at $5,700. I wouldn’t feel bad at all about buying there.
Never be discouraged because you didn’t get the exact bottom price. Be encouraged that you got close. In the grand scheme of things, you’ll just see a small dip, and you bought somewhere in there. Exact numbers wonm’t matter.

Where I live, Coinbase/GDAX is the only place I can pull money from my bank account or credit card. Cex.io, poloniox, Kraken, and Gemini (I don’t remember if I’ve tried others) won’t give me an account or won’t let me verify due to where I live in the US.
This weekend, I managed to use Cex.io as a basic account and sell off my BCH, but I can’t actually buy BTC with USD.
Additionally, I prefer using GDAX for sure, but it still takes time to retrieve the funds. Coinbase will, at a small premium, allow you to buy at current prices, even if you won’t get the BTC right away. It’s the fastest way to buy at a price you want, without holding up USD.

Yeah, Coinbase also owns Gdax.  It's a separate platform, but since you have an account with Coinbase, everything carries over to Gdax.  It's more complex, as any exchange would be.  But it's a true exchange, taking place on a market-like platform, whereas Coinbase is more of a buy/sell platform directly from Coinbase.  Unfortunately, no matter where you go...if you need to pull money from your outside bank account, you'll be looking at a good wait.  But once you get your money in, it's much faster.  And Gdax you don't have the 1.5% fee.... The fees there are what you hear people talking about regarding the size of your transaction (different than the amount).
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:32:12

First, it sounds like it's just a way to SEE all your investments in one place, similar to any personal finance application like many banks offer, or mint.com.  It may not allow you to actually do anything with it.  Second, it's not "it now allows," like these titles suggest.  It's "will soon allow." An announcement is different than an implementation.
Welcome to the internet, me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:22:39
I agree.  Could be wrong and it'll tank again soon, but this upward mobility looks like it's just leveling out already.  The value has increased enough after the lowest dip that I can't see a significant drop again soon.  My opinion only.  
I'm HODLing regardless.  And I don't have enough spare change to throw in more.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:02:26
One of us is confused.  When they say now is the right time to HODL, they mean to not sell.  They aren't saying to not buy.  Basically, if anything buy more.  Though realistically, the price is the same as a day or two ago.  Not really much of a dip.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:31:05
The US, for the most part, considers Bitcoin a capital asset.  You must report gains and losses when you either sell OR trade.  In other words, if you buy something directly with Bitcoin, you are still expected to report the value of your gains.

I've never used kraken or gemini, so I couldn't honestly give a recommendation.  I just know that you're basically already setup with Gdax.  Gemini and kraken you'd have to go through the verification process all over again for deposits and such.  However, I'd suggest giving all 3 a try.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:06:58
Sure, you can day trade bitcoin.
1) People generally suggest you NOT day trade, period.
2) I see people use  a lot.  They have a monthly fee if you want to use it for trading.
3) Several exchanges out there such as Kraken, Gemini, and Gdax.  They are free as far as I know, outside of typical transaction fees for confirmations.
Honestly, if you have to ask these questions... you haven't done enough of your own research and probably aren't ready for it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:11:39
Very much this.  You will then have far more problems than just a dip in price.  My credit union charges $28 for overdraft.  Lets also assume you bought at $2800, and the price dropped to $2375.  Thats a 15.2% reduction.  That means your original transaction would have to be at least $1842 to be worth it to cover the overdraft fee.
Thats completely ignoring the fact that you'll probably be shut out of further transactions with coinbase for a time.  At the VERY least from your bank, if not more.  I don't know what they do when the transaction is denied.  But you probably wouldn't recover in time to buy at the dip unless you had another exchange as a backup.
TL;DR: Just HODL
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:45:36
Yeah, agree.  The true meaning behind a patent is to make it worth it for the inventor to... Invent!  Prevent others from profiting before you've been able to make your money back plus some extra.
But what I believe is that there shouldn't be anything worth patenting that will give you an unfair advantage in the Bitcoin world.  It's not what it's here for.
Of course.... China doesn't really care about patents.

@_date: 2017-05-26 01:43:54
Pretty much.  The deep dark web.
I learned about it when it first started through a gaming community. One guy was real big into coding.  Developing and hacking.  The type of person that youd find in the dark corners of the web.  He told me about it.  And I decided not to buy.  I don't know where he found out about it.
I keep telling myself I couldn't have bought even if I wanted to because I had no money.

@_date: 2017-05-30 04:00:06
Ah, I've been researching this kind of stuff all day.  It's starting to make sense.  In short, does this mean if I buy 1 Bitcoin a day every day for 3 days... And then transfer/sell 3 bitcoins, then the transaction size from the input portion will be 540 bytes instead of 180?  In other words, it can ultimately be more expensive to acquire bitcoins in smaller but more frequent transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:52:16
Think of it this way.... Gdax you are trading with others.  Coinbase you are trading with coinbase.  But both are owned by Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:34:06
What stops someone from buying them all?  Nothing, but technically sellers do... It'd be quite expensive. Then of course there's the fact that not all coins are mined yet.  Even if they were, it would simply not be feasible to buy all the coins.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:07:27
Not to mention, I think for a lot of people, it takes time to jump in after they get used to the idea and can follow it a bit.  People like me have a hard time being "innovators."  I learned about bitcoins YEARS ago.  I had online friends using it.  While I thought it was cool at the time, I didn't see much use for it.  After watching it a bit, I thought it was too volatile back then as currency.  Then I ignored it.
Then several months ago I purchased some just to spend (someplace was offering a discount if I used Bitcoin).  But I thought close to the same thing, thinking the value was going down again.  Boy was I wrong.  I finally started purchasing last week.  But it took several years of knowing about it first.
Following along is a lot different than catching up by reading the history.

@_date: 2017-05-28 19:59:41
Yup.  A correction is basically just returning back to baseline after abnormal growth, right?  So the question is really just.... What's the real baseline?  Bitcoin isn't supposed to be just an investment.  It's supposed to be currency.  In normal investments, people go in and out trying to make money.  And that certainly happens here too.  But bitcoins goal is to get people to stay and actually use it.  Not just sell out.  So baseline is dependent on the level of adoption.  Which is a little harder to gauge, no?

Makes me sick that they are the ONLY reliable way I can purchase bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:43:51
I've been reading about this stuff a lot lately, as I'm still getting into Bitcoin (if only I invested years ago when I first learned about it).  I hear it's not worth it for a starter to get into bitcoin-qt (known as bitcoin-core, now, right?). It seems easy enough to get into paper wallets, however.  As long as you are careful on how you handle it, otherwise there's not much to it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:48:11
Naw, HODL.  It could be worth millions soon, if you are to believe this place.

Is the reddit title incorrect?  It looks like its not expected to be rolled out for another couple months at least, but the title here makes it sound like its "now integrated."  Did the article update their title, but its still the old title here?
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:27:03
Of course they do.  Can't make money off cash.
@_date: 2017-07-28 23:58:28
I think you may be confusing "Look at those idiots doing dumb things, it's good they are out of here!" with "They are being dumb by leaving, I want them to stay!"
You can be glad someone is gone, and still make fun of their shenanigans.

Shouldn't these posts be in the Jokes subreddit?

Don't trust others with your money, especially when they have nothing to gain from it.  You have to do your own research and make your own decisions.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:11:55
If anything, itd be a Ponzi scheme.  Sheesh.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:32:45
Because it's reddit.  Who isn't addicted to reddit?

Crappy service, to be sure.  But last time I put money in Coinbase, I thought they made it clear that you should pull using Coinbase, and not push using your bank.
But maybe I just didn't trust the system enough to rely on the money going to the right place properly, instead of having Coinbase pull it for me.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:50:31
Take the money from my account and put the coins in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:05:13
That means you didn't see the notice on the confirmation page that tells you exactly when you'll get the coins.  When you get your email confirming you set up the transaction, it will also tell you exactly when to expect them.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:47
Yeah, if this is the perfect time for you to buy.... then technically it was the perfect time to buy about a day and a half ago as well, or anytime before then.  This is not a dip anyone could have been waiting for.
The point is, this is nothing special.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:32:43
I mean.... Would you rather have $4, or not have $4?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:15:25
I calculated 1.5% fees, though they might have a minimum fee around $1.99?
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:56:48
Why is this, and many other links I click on sometimes, blocked for me?

Im a stock market newbie.  So this may seem really dumb, but Google searches haven't been able to find the answer for me.  Ive got my money diversified, but I had some I wanted to put into GBTC a while back.  But on Fidelity, it told me I could only purchase a minimum of 100 shares, which I don't have enough money for.  Does that sound right?  Is it a Fidelity thing?  GBTC thing? General stocks thing?
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:22:51
I'd like to have salary in Bitcoin.  I'm getting tired of this 1.5% fee crap.  Oh well.  Might as well see it as simple 1.5% premium.

I'm on a phone using Chrome.  Are you saying there is some adblocking feature by default on Chrome for mobile?

Not that he's completely wrong, but he's missing the point of reviews.  A review is a personal statement of your experience.  Can't just say what everyone else says.
Edit:. Not having seen your review, I can't even say if the whole thing is off topic.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:45:17
Lost coins essentially have the same effect as HODL.  They are out of circulation.  The difference is that they will NEVER be used.
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:01:08
Haha.  Yeah.  Every new digital currency is expected to be the next most used.
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:04:30
It takes time to properly set value to stuff like this.   The only way new people know how is association.  
I work in the medical field, and everyone has to get used to 24-hour time.  They only way people learn is by associating 2100 with 9:00pm.  It's just how it works until it becomes much more common.
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:21:54
Agreed.  Typo.  In fact, I've noticed my phone likes to lay down periods for me all the time automatically.
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:05:42
Some might say that Bitcoin won't remain decentralized UNLESS you run the core.

"Deal with it nerds, your* time is near. You think you made it big but you're* just a security nerd who blew all their trust funds."
There, fixed it for you.
Edit: Typo
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:11:10
With Coinbase, the prices at the time you made the transaction are locked, yes.  It doesn't matter what prices are when it finally goes through.
Are you saying you have bitcoins somewhere, and you are opening a Coinbase account to sell them?
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:48:49
My bad.  I didn't notice that.  I had assumed you added that as a marker.  If you zoom in, you actually see a weird gap between the 15th and 16th.  But I'm in the same boat as you, then.  I'm not sure what happened.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:40:36
"I cant afford a $100 bill," or "I can't afford to spend my $100 bill on a soda."  Life is hard.  If only there was a way around that.
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:32:46
That I'd rather not support them if I could help it.  With my limited options, the pros still outweigh the cons.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:44:47
That's crazy talk.  Get outta here with your crazy.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:53:20
You appear to be talking to a copy/paster.
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:48:10
Ah.  A typo!  Thanks for catching that!  Makes much more sense now.  Apparently math is hard.

Because it's literally the only place I've found I can use in Kansas, USA.  I can get verified (identification) on other exchanges, but I can't seem to actually use them because if where I live.
@_date: 2017-06-30 00:18:25
Technically,. Yes.  Lost coins are the same as permanently held coins, which is the same as coins not being circulated/reused/traded what have you.  But since you can have infinite decimals , unlike fiat, it doesn't matter a whole lot.  It's just as the value of 1 Bitcoin changes, the price of goods will eventually match.

I never realized how serious the reposting issue was on Reddit until this kid popped in the news.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:24:01
Lets see.... you haven't said anything about how much bitcoin you got from it so far.  A quick calculation shows 2 years (104 weeks) would net you 1.768btc.
Perhaps the .001btc weekly created 104 inputs, thus your transaction fee would be crazy high?  Maybe it'll be ok down the road.
Edit:  I mistyped in my calculation.  You only have a Max of 0.1768btc.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:16:09
While others think $100 is a crash.

Sure, if people want to make their own worthless crypto... They are welcome to.

Personally, I was looking into a self-directed IRA.  Take those Roth dollars, throw it into Bitcoin, and let those tax free dollars grow!  But self directed IRAs could be scary.
@_date: 2017-06-26 04:13:50
Chill.  I knew about it back in 2009, and STILL didn't get in.  While I liked the idea, I didn't know where it'd be today.  And I gamed too much to bother with mining.  And I thought it was way too volatile to use as a currency.  But oh well.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:44:41
If only I was actually allowed to use them.  I'm verified in several places, but Coinbase is the only one I can actually use.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:14:15
It drops less than 2.5% and you call it a crash?  That happens multiple times a day!
