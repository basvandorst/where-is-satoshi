I run a full node (actually, three of them at the moment) and I mined for about a year with a few terahash per sec.
I'm learning the crypto and the distributed algos the protocol is based on. I try to keep up to date with the latest developments (lightning, zk-SNARKs, MimbleWimble...)
I explain it as best as I can when people ask me about it but I refrain to bring it up when they don't. But I generally talk a lot more about economics and the philosophy of human civilization, nowdays...
I'm currently developping an "innovative" (i.e. potentially totally useless) layer 2 service in the hope it will become Bitcoin's next killer app, thus making me a lot of money and making the whole project more valuable in the process.
And I buy a lot of bitcoin, which helps the price, which then helps the project :)

I have run two S3's from august 2014 till march 2016. It was a pretty nice experience. I used a Corsair AX1200i as power supply.
At the current network specs of 1.6 exahash per second and 1800 bitcoin per day, you can expect to mine about 0.03 bitcoin per month, or $17.50 at current price.
Of course, the electricity cost for 700 watts of power 24/7 is about four times as much, so that's a net loss if you pay for power.

That's because you're used to relying on a company (a bank or payment processor) for this kind of service. But because Bitcoin is decentralized, it shifts much of the responsibility to the user: responsibility to secure your own bitcoins as well as keep track of coin fragmentation, transaction size, fees and so on.
Right now, Bitcoin is nowhere as easy to use as a bank or credit card, even though wallets are constantly evolving to try and make the user experience simpler.
Here's the old Internet analogy: when you call someone on the phone, you expect it to "work the first time, instantly and without issue". But when doing Voice-over-IP (VoIP), not so much... Does it mean that the Internet is worthless compared to telephone networks? No, just that you can't blame a single provider for a service failure, so you need to do some homework to know who to blame.
Decentralized services always come with a learning curve.

Because centralized custodians like MtGOX, Bitfinex and Coinbase are *inherently* hackable, so claims such as the above will only cause more and more people to lose their coins.
Bitcoin users need to understand that the old-world model of centralized banking is *not secure* in this context. And sadly, those that don't will learn the hard way.

Yep, I'd try to double spend it, since CPFP is not an option (no change address).
Double spends from Electrum are a bit tricky: if you have a recent enough backup of your wallet file, just run Electrum from it while making sure it can't connect to the Internet (and thus, won't "see" that last transaction). You can then create a double-spending transaction while offline and then reconnect to broadcast it.

Because old addresses where paid to an ECC public key while new addresses are paid to the *SHA256 hash* of a public key:
Before: Private key -&gt; Public key
Now: Private key -&gt; Public key -&gt; Hash
And although public key derivation seems to be reversible with quantum computing, cryptographic hashing doesn't.
However, note that reusing existing addresses discloses your public key, so these aren't as secure.

It's quite simple, really: you need both a power-efficient miner and access to cheap power. For example, I have been mining at home with two Antminers S3 for a year and it has been an enjoyable (if not very lucrative) experience.
The S3 has a power efficiency of [1300 MH/j]( and my power comes at [0.15 $/KWh](
So yes, it is possible without a "big mining operation", but not without specialized (and recent) hardware.

One major weakness of Bitcoin is the energy consumption of the proof-of-work system: the total energy consumption of the system scales linearly with the value of a token (i.e. the consumption doubles if the price of a bitcoin doubles).
Many people are currently working on alternatives such as proof-of-stake, but their security model is much more complex and thus not widely agreed upon. So far, Bitcoin's proof-of-work is the only widely accepted way of maintaining a distributed time-stamped ledger.
Right now, the consumption is in the 500 MW ballpark, or about as much as a medium-sized city. Bitcoin advocates will inevitably compare this with the some figure of the power consumption of the traditional banking sector, but I don't find this relevant: Bitcoin's power consumption comes from proof-of-work.
On the other hand, this is mitigated by the halving of the mining reward every four years, which should also halve total power consumption. So in effect, if the value of a bitcoin (only) doubles every four years, the global power consumption should stay constant.

It's based on BIP32 and BIP39: the secret you backup is the mnemonic passphrase (BIP39). From this seed, all your private keys can be calculated (BIP32).
The main advantage is that the private keys never get out of the trezor: an unsigned transaction is sent to it, checked by the user on the screen, signed inside the trezor and sent back to the computer.

These are addresses, not UTXOs. Look at this [graph](
Here's some quick stats I pulled from the blockchain:
    Size of UTXO set, by rank, in satoshi, as of block 355000:
    10^14: 1
    10^13: 83
    10^12: 1487
    10^11: 16189
    10^10: 123394
    10^9 : 418934
    10^8 : 1080843
    10^7 : 3003178
    10^6 : 2342777
    10^5 : 5338847
    10^4 : 4392591
    10^3 : 1052833
    10^2 : 345642
    10^1 : 906062
    ---------------
    Total: 19022861
So your estimate is an order of magnitude off, but your argument is still technically valid.
But the main point is not that the UTXO set is manageable *right now*: I just parsed it in PHP and Bash to produce those stats, so I should know.
Rather, the main point is that it's growing *too fast*, and we should be looking for ways to analyze and remedy that situation.

People in this sub can't bear to be reminded that *Bitcoin is fallible*, and that a lot of hard work (both by individuals and as a group) is going to be required for it not to *fail* at every possible occasion.
The UTXO-set size problem needs to be addressed: assuming that every Bitcoin user owns a linearly-growing number of UTXOs, and also assuming a linearly growing number of users, we end-up with a quadratic growth of the UTXO set.
What can be done about it? One of two possible things: either reduce the number of UTXOs (for example by disincentivizing "UTXO hoarding") or find ways around needing to keep UTXOs in RAM.
And please: no silver bullet in the tune of "technology will just advance fast enough"...
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:17:57
OK, let me rephrase that: Bitcoin makes it really easy for anyone to move vasts amounts of *bitcoin* around. It was *designed* for that!
So you are actually arguing against bitcoin being money, which we all know to be false: it *is* money for the people who chose to use it, and as the user base expands, there will be less and less reason to make the round trip back to fiat.

I don't *have* a solution, obviously. And I know about the need for fungibility and the misled attempts at establishing "address blacklists".
But look at it this way: what if you were a store accepting bitcoin that got robbed by a bitcoin-stealing virus, and someone later attempted to make a purchase from you using the *very same* bitcoin (as in "same address") that were stolen from you? You would refuse the transaction, or maybe try and get their mail address and call the police...
I know it's extremely unlikely (as well as dumb on the thief's part), but I believe it shows that bitcoins are not completely fungible in all cases. Maybe it could be possible to invent some protocol on top of Bitcoin for "coin reputation" that could be used voluntarily by communities to defend themselves against bad actors? Or maybe it could be proven to be futile and harmful to look for such a protocol, I don't know.
@_date: 2016-03-05 11:37:22
There still seems to be a problem: the current fee suggestion is 140 spb even though low-fee transactions are coming through just fine.
The problem comes from a huge amount of chained 133 spb transactions that spend a long time in the mempool before being eventually included in a block. See for example [block 401265](

That's an advice for *extremely advanced* novices...
As for creating a new transaction, I would suggest starting from your existing transaction and removing the change output.

At over 40 satoshis per byte, it should go through promptly (assuming it gets picked up by a full-RBF miner!).

People are having these problems for real, obviously. Anyone who was used to (unknowingly) sending transactions with fee rate in the range 10 to 40 S/B got their transactions stuck in the mempool for the past 48 hours due to a steady stream of higher-priority transactions during that period.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:46:27
It's hard to guess if your wallet doesn't tell you when it creates the transaction. The idea is that transactions are made of inputs and outputs. The "basic" form is one input and two outputs, and that's about 225 bytes. But if your wallet doesn't contain a single input large enough to cover the payment, it will need to group several input together and that will make the transaction bigger.
So a 0.1 mBTC fee that would be right for a 225 bytes transaction (44 sat./byte) becomes too small for a 500 bytes transaction (20 sat./byte) that would include three inputs instead of just one.
Right now, many wallets don't do a very good job at choosing the right fee, but a simple optional UI to display the transaction size or even choose the fee *per byte* would go a long way in easing all the fee market event pain we seem to be experiencing.

That would be because this is a [suspended roller coaster](

Not necessarily: if you set a high-enough fee on the second transaction to pay for both, they are likely to be picked up by a CPFP-compliant miner. That's precisely what seems to have happened to your transactions, even though the combined fee rate was only 100 sat/byte, which is a bit low for the current demand.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:38:42
First, find your stuck transaction on a block explorer and try to figure out why your fee was too low in the first place. Use [cointape]( to figure out the correct fee.
Second, identify your change address for the first transaction and spend this particular coin ("coin" tab -&gt; right-click -&gt; spend in Electrum) back to yourself with a high-enough fee to cover for both transactions.
Search for "child pays for parent" (CPFP) for more informations.
Edit: it seems that very few miners (less than 10% of the global hashrate) currently supports CPFP. What this means is that you should be ready to wait a few more hours after you broadcast the child transaction to get confirmed: the time for a CPFP-compliant miner to hit a block. Please keep this in mind if you're in a hurry.

In the case of *centralized* online wallets (e.g. *not* blockchain.info), the answer is yes, he can.
But that means their total bitcoin balance becomes greater than the amount of actual bitcoin they have on reserve. It's called running on fractional reserve and by the way, it's the norm in the traditional banking sector.
Then, if there ever is a "run on the bank" and everybody tries to take their bitcoin out of the service at the same time, the situation is exposed and the company goes bankrupt. Just like MtGox and *un*like "too big to fail" banks that get bailed out instead.

The "fee market" denotes the fact that users want to make more transactions than there is room to store them in the blockchain. When that happens, high-fee transactions go in first and low-fee transactions wait, possibly indefinitely.
By making the blocks bigger, Bitcoin Cash increases the capacity of the blockchain and can thus accept more low-fee (or even free) transactions.

Yes, a lot of people care: proof-of-work "wastes" a lot of electricity and people are working on proof-of-stake schemes for this very reason.
The problem is economic in nature, and a hard one at that. Ethereum should switch to [proof-of-stake]( in a few months, which will be very interesting to watch.


If I understand the economics correctly, the marginal cost of mining should be equal to the marginal revenue, which means the total price of electricity spent on mining bitcoin should be equal to the total price of the new bitcoin (plus the transaction fees).
So for example:
       12.5 bitcoin/block
    *     6 block/hour
    --------------------
    =    75 bitcoin/hour
    *   770 $/bitcoin
    --------------------
    = 57750 $/hour
    /  0.05 $/kWh
    --------------------
    = 1155000 kW
So today, the bitcoin mining network should be consuming about a gigawatt of electricity. If the price doubles, energy consumption should also double. Likewise, when the mining reward is halved, consumption should be halved.
By this logic, should the price of bitcoin reach one million dollars by 2020, mining it would consume about half of the world's total electricity output.

Well, I kind of assumed that since the size of the mempool is finite, very old low-fee transactions would eventually drop out.

Kind of.
With a cartesian graph, "log scale" means that you plot "y = log(f(x))" instead of "y = f(x)".
Here, you compare values (x) using surfaces (x^2 ) or volumes (x^3 ). So if you compare two spheres, one of which is 10 times the diameter of the other, its surface is 100 (10^2 ) as large and its volume is 1000 (10^3 ) as large.
So in effect, you plot "y = squareRoot (f(x))" or "y = cubeRoot (f(x))", respectively.

I believe you mean "addresses", not "wallets". A wallet is a software that manages this plethora of addresses so that its owner doesn't have to.


The first rule is to never reuse an address, but it's not a sufficient condition. Then there are mixing services, both trusted (e.g. bitmixer.io) and trustless (CoinJoin).

Bitcoin's value is abstract. Take gold, look at *why* people value it (rarity, security, non-counterfeitability...), use that as axioms for your system and remove everything else. You get Bitcoin.
Of course, there is no reason it couldn't be overtaken or even replaced by a "better" coin. In the long run, it probably will be. But right now, some of the best devs are hard at work to make sure it stays ahead of the pack.

I think the reason is that it's much simpler to express this way. And since this is like *the core* consensus rule, simplicity is crucial.
On the other hand, a smooth exponential curve is *mathematically* simpler than the current function, but it's harder to express with integers.
As for changing that rule... I don't think we would ever get consensus on that, even if the successive halving events proved to be incredibly disruptive. It's much too close to the holy 21M limit!

They differ in the way they compromise openness vs. security:
Trezor favors openness: off-the-shelf components and fully open-source firmware. It's the "nothing up my sleeve" approach.
Ledger favors security: it uses a "secure element", which is a closely guarded secret chip in order to make attacks harder.
Both ways have advantages and drawbacks. Personally, I'm a Trezor user.

Yes, the attack can be "global" if someone replays *all* transactions from one fork to the other (or in both directions), but whenever this global attack is *not currently* happening, someone can make a targeted attack as well, by replaying select transactions.
But you are correct to point out that your proposed procedure would in fact work, assuming no attack takes place.
In fact, you don't even need to wait: just send your original bitcoin to A and your forked bitcoin to B. If no attack happens, your coins will be split and if there is an attack, both coins will end up in either A or B, so you can just start again.
The important point is that, until your coins are split, you should only make transactions to addresses *you* control. If not, you run the risk of sending both coins instead of just one to the other party.

That seems to be a common pattern. In my case, the whole process went something like this:
* learned about Bitcoin, found it a bit dull and dismissed it,
* got around to installing Bitcoin Core a few years later,
* got a friend to lend me 0.01 bitcoin for testing,
* understood the blockchain and the consensus network,
* got my mind blown by it all,
* was helplessly sucked in as I scrambled to buy the 1.32 bitcoin I needed to order an ASIC miner.
I really think the community should concentrate on understanding what triggers this "moment" that most Bitcoiners have been through: the time they actually go down the rabbit hole.
Does anyone know if it has an official name, by the way? Maybe something not too heavily tainted by religious terminology?

Only invest your sanity in Bitcoin if you can afford to lose it. I'm 100% in on that count.

In a Bitcoin transaction, you cannot "only change the mining fee". A transaction is made of inputs (the UTXOs or "coins") and outputs (the "addresses"). When the sum of the inputs is greater that the sum of the outputs, the difference is kept by the miners as mining fees.
So in order to change the mining fee, you need to change some inputs or some outputs. With "First-seen safe RBF", you can require that the outputs don't change, but it then requires new inputs every time you want to increase the mining fee so it is less efficient than "Full RBF", where you are allowed to change the outputs.
The idea here is that, in order to increase the mining fee, you keep the same inputs but simply decrease the change (the amount of bitcoin that is returned to one of your own addresses). But since miners can't know wich address is yours and which address belongs to the payee, they can't guarantee that you are not converting some of the original payment into fees...
Does that make sense? And now that I come to think of it, another solution could be to somehow "flag" the change address in the transaction: that would allow for some transactions to be replaced-by-fee only if *some* outputs stay the same... That would reduce anonymity, but only for those transactions that require zero-conf, right?

It's for "bumping" the priority of one of your transactions, when you realize that it's still stuck in the mempool after an unacceptable number of mined blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:14:12


Because of how Bitcoin transactions work, every time you spend a coin (or "UTXO"), you must spend all of it. So if you only want to spend a fraction of a coin, you must construct a transaction that will spend parts of that whole coin to both the payee's address and one address you own. That's the change address.
In [BIP44]( (the key derivation scheme used by Electrum and many other wallets), it has been decided to keep receiving addresses and change addresses separate, but there is nothing "special" about one or the other.
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:32:00

I guess your original transaction did not have a change address, then? Did you send the whole content of the wallet to kraken?
In that case (no change address), your last solution is to try and double-spend your transaction with a higher fee. I haven't tried it yet so I can't tell you how to do it.

It seems to me that a global bitcoin payment option that converts to fiat on the fly would be missing the point. It would be better to integrate direct bitcoin payment for the creators that want it.
On the other hand, internal bitcoin handling would require some pretty steep security upgrade on their part. Or they could outsource it to Coinbase or something.

When you ask your wallet software to send bitcoin, it will first construct a message called a [transaction]( that specifies the *inputs* (which bitcoins to spend) and the *outputs* (where to send them). It will then proceed to signing this transaction with your private keys, and then it will broadcast the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network.
But by using the raw transaction functions of Bitcoin Core, it is possible to construct the transaction *manually*, and thus have complete control over its inputs and outputs. After that, you can ask the software to sign this transaction, and finally, to broadcast the signed transaction.
To sum up, raw transactions allow you to have complete control over the way transactions are generated, signed and broadcast. But obviously, this control comes with the risk of making a human mistake and having the wrong bitcoin sent to the wrong place.

Well, note that you *can't* tell Mycelium to send funds "from address a": you can only tell it to send from a certain account, and accounts usually contain several addresses. So in this case, using raw transactions could allow you to send from a particular address.
But raw transactions are mainly used to experiment with new applications such as colored coins, multi-signatures, Coinjoin and so on. Personally, I'm using them to test an idea for a new protocol related to colored coins.

It was [open source]( before it was purchased by 21 in january 2016.
I agree that Johoe's mempool viewer is really great, I've been using it to estimate my fees for a few months and it never failed me, down to 1 sat/B.

You can import your seed in Electrum, and then set the fee manually from there.
I too have noticed really high fees in Mycelium. For example, for a 226 bytes transaction:
* Low-prio: 0.66 mBTC (292 satoshi/byte)
* Economic: 0.73 mBTC (323 satoshi/byte)
* Normal: 0.99 mBTC (438 satoshi/byte)
* Priority: 1.22 mBTC (540 satoshi/byte)
For reference, a low-priority transaction right now should be priced at around 60 satoshi/byte.

It depends on the [current content of the mempool](
For example, the mempool has been all but empty for the past 10 hours. In that timeframe, the optimal fee ratio has been 20 satoshi per byte, or about US $0.12 for a simple transaction.
On the other hand, yesterday's mempool was much more crowded and the optimal fee was more in the range of 300-400 sat/b (about 20 times higer, or $2.4 per transaction).
