Like those websites that popped up like mushrooms, you put your crypto address and they allegedly mining crypto for you, what a bs!
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:31:26
No one said all!
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:13:45
Binance is my favorite exchange because it can be used without verification!
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:38:41
Well, the best way to do it is when you go to the toilet, just hold to your thingy and don't let it go, ok, now you're a hodler!
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:43:15
Just bought a little bit of Ethereum out there to play on Stake.com, super smooth service, no poop samples needed!
Good bye LocalBitcoins!
Bitcoin price is somewhat quite speculative though!
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:44:27
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:53:12
Seems like not everyone here knows the meaning of the word - amazing and it's amazing! Thanks for the downvote!
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:23:41
Taxation is the problem overall, theft!
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:31:07
What was isn't important, what matters is only now!
The only possible way to become a Whale by hanging out in the crypto space now is to hope that some shitcoin would ramp up like crazy!
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:29:43
You won't find anything quicker than LocalCryptos.com!
@_date: 2019-11-22 23:53:38
@_date: 2019-11-23 00:09:32
Why would anyone be interested in custodial services?
@_date: 2019-11-29 16:18:53
What data? Email?
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:01:52
LocalCryptos.com, have fun!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:01:17
You can't deposit Bitcoin into a bank account!
If anything use Cryptopay.me, requires verification though, but on your friends end!
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:41:05
And it got to 2k and then to 15k again, no worries just the end of the year!
Come on, all the companies discount their useless crap by the end of the year so does Bitcoin with its price!
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:17:36
No, coz they're busy living their lives instead of wasting them on the Internet!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:48:05
Yeah I do!
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:41:06
Yeah, but you also can carry your plastic card with any amount of money, fees may apply though!
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:23:14
And Churches!
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:55:04
Exactly man! I now use LocalCryptos.com, I've mentioned it many times here, very convenient and lots of different payments available, no poop samples, lol! I stumbled on it by chance and very glad I did!
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:35:55
Super easy LocalCryptos.com, I've switched to it after LocalBitcoins.com became a governmental whores!
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:29:35
February 2014!
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:43:10
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:44:31
Nah, it's not mobile friendly or should I say mobile unusable, you need hundred bucks to put there to even start using it, too many hoops, at LocalCryptos.com you just go and buy quite instantly!
Geez, they have to start paying me!
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:44:10
You hold until you can get a good profit and then you cash out to get useable money to buy food and services and to live in general!
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:25:25
Passphrase for 1k of Bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:40:32
I dunno, I don't give a damn what the currency is, just need a lot of it, whether crypto, paper, whatever you can use to buy the real life shit!
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:59:56
There's CoinMarketCap for that!
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:12:08
Thanks sir, much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:36:23
I remember I won half of Bitcoin at CoinRoyale.com
Now I also play at Stake.com
Both are super cool casinos!
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:01:53
Don't put the main one though!
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:25:06
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:42:11
LocalBitcoins.com is still a thing?
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:34:08
Crypto is here to stay, although there will be more of a state crypto!
Remember all those sci-fi movies, what currency do they all have in common?
Right, so called "credits", we're almost there!
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:05:00
Have to agree, sure!
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:26:52
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:53:43
Yeah, I myself wouldn't mind people sending me some Bitcoins, a few thousand will do!
@_date: 2019-11-25 22:41:18
Not fees, but prices themselves!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:59:08
Wow, cool, highest I beat was around 1700 ha! We could try sometime, not now, now I'm going to bed, but I can follow you, send me your nickname!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:52:28
Well, I play at lichess.org, got to 1576 then tumbled to 1400 lol, now going back!
It's not that big at all, what's your rating?
I play only Blitz and Bullet!
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:52:40
Yeah, all those mining websites popped up like mushrooms, with plans and all, what a drivel!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:49:54
That counsel is suicidal af, after listening all that whining and moaning, geez!
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:26:48
Nah, 5k Satoshis incrementally, solving captcha, withdrawal each week, was fun, was 2014!
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:49:34
Don't try to find people unless you want to get mugged or worse!
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:50:25
Well, TA is a drivel alright, but nobody knows? Come on, big old man always knows!
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:32:14
@_date: 2019-11-29 17:51:26
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:17:17
LocalBitcoins, now since LocalBitcoins bitched away I use LocalCryptos!
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:21:29
Can't ban something that wasn't there in the first place!
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:36:51
Need a poop sample, no go!
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:27:47
Yeah, I've just swiped it through the Bitcoin Core wallet and got 1k of Bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:14:12
The most I waited was about three weeks, it was when Bitcoin's fees were through the roof!
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:33:51
I bet you're a successful, well, Redditor, ahahahahah!
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:21:01
Go buy Bitcoins there without any BS directly via plastic card: LocalCryptos.com
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:20:49
Do you remember one of the first Bitcoin faucets - Pirate Chest, was an awesome faucet that was really paying!
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:16:50
Exactly what I mean!
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:15:02
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:23:56
Your lucky day, LocalCryptos.com, there's virtually no other place to buy Bitcoins without anyone asking you for ID and all the other crap!
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:38:14
No wonder, another fascist state!
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:22:38
Would be a cool country if not for the governmental scum that ought to be eliminated!
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:34:01
Sure, but if I had any real money I almost wouldn't be touching Internet, I barely do anyways!
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:16:30
Not only Bitcoin, but crypto overall!
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:57:34
It is if you have money, ahahahahah!
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:27:47
Bought today again on LocalCryptos.com!
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:09:52
Nothing shady about it, dude asked and I gave him a few examples of great casinos I'm playing at!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:27:54
Well, I wouldn't mind to have a few million of Dash, Litecoin or Ethereum!
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:26:01
Not a start of the year yet!
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:48:04
Exactly, I'd be a happy elephant with 20k green and would go travel!
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:18:43
ShapeShift just launched their new FOX coin for exactly that, but you need a piss and a poop sample to use their exchange!
You can get a hundred FOX coins when apply!
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:14:25
That's why many people giving up on the U.S. citizenship, fuck IRS and all this taxes crap!
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:50:35
Yeah unfortunate, well, people will still find a way how to circumvent the governmental scum!
@_date: 2019-11-29 02:37:29
It's amazing that it works!
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:58:59
Some slavebeats didn't, ha-ha!
@_date: 2019-11-27 02:46:19
LocalCryptos.com, you won't regret it, the only real place right now!
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:49:53
You don't say!
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:42:30
When all the bears in Paris will die off!
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:27:50
Really need to convince 10k people to pay for something 10 dollars a piece each month, within 10 months you'll have your mil!
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:20:52
There you go, not that precise, but close: 
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:22:22
Unfortunately the same old way as you do with any money!
Fortunately those who got into crypto early don't have to think about "earning" anymore!
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:34:13
Use LocalCryptos.com instead!
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:41:25
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:11:01
Should've bought 10 Bitcoins in 2014!
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:42:35
I wonder whether it's Mars or Venues in retrograde today?
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:02:01
Why an X city has a 5 million people and say 100 million travels by subway each month?
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:57:05
Ahahahahah, bigoted dummy!
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:16:39
Indoctrinated slaves started a downvote, what a sheeple!
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:15:01
End of the year, duh!
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:20:57
Everything is legal in Unicornia!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:40:16
From the big G: Angel number 21 is a sign from your angels of advancement and success. Angel number 21 is all about unity, fulfillment, and happiness. When you see angel number 21 appear in your experience, it is an auspicious sign from your angels that you are on the verge of manifesting your desires on a large scale.
And manifest it did, for those who have gotten early!
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:26:24
Well, yeah, a lot of shady people out here, maybe a BitSpark's shill, BitSpark is so lame, just checked it, boo!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:06:27
Nah, don't play there, that website is a total shit, waste of time!
It's pity you can't post links here, fascist rules, I PM'd you with one of the best Crypto Casinos out there!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:45:36
Only 1.5 mil left!
@_date: 2019-12-19 23:55:37
Someone has a problem, ahahahahahaha, lol!
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:22:19
Slave downvote, why are you in crypto then, boomer!
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:15:48
Yeah, I'll wait and buy at 2-3k!
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:11:00
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:39:59
Lovely Nassim, love his books, except for the last one!
@_date: 2019-12-01 11:46:25
Had is the word here, not now, right, I reckon it was fixed since?
Anyways, is there anything that simple and instant like LocalCryptos?
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:18:02
No worries, it'll bounce to 20k in Jan-Feb, dunno what all fuss is all about!
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:45:45
Define illegal, banks are illegal then!
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:46:51
Ahh, I see, was very stupid of me not to check!
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:53:44
Alright, thanks for the info, much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:57:02
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:53:25
To fight regulators people have to stop paying taxes all together, all people at once!
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:41:47
I know that, the whole fucking system ought to be redone!
Their services suck a big time!
In the meantime make taxes self-included and close this problem once and for all, for export and companies that trade overseas a flat 10 or 20 percent tax!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:53:07
The easiest is LocalCryptos.com!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:49:32
Absolutely concur with you, there are lots of useful cryptos out there, and many people have made millions of dollars on alts, some dude made a few millions on Decred back in the day, was researching it and whatnot!
Living Room Of Satoshi accepts lots of cryptos to pay for a slew of different bills!
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:52:03
You want to scam a scammer?
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:29:17
LocalBitcoins are indeed turned out to shit, wheres LocalCryptos are superb!
@_date: 2019-12-10 02:05:04
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:52:11
Exactly, fuck the Russian gov and all the scum in it, simple as that, same goes for the U.S. obviously!
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:13:08
As long as you won't be paying taxes off your crypto, yes, otherwise it's all the same!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:53:14
What do they have for BTC? Too high?
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:04:51
You don't need it if you continue to pay taxes, ahahahahah!
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:13:06
Cheers man, I'm buying over there and haven't been happier!
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:18:05
Yeah, as long as people are willing to pay taxes nothing will change, what fucking decentralization are they talking about when slaves start to protect their indoctrination to taxes like: there won't be no roads, check, roads are fucked, no medicine and doctors, check, medicine is fucked, no police, checked, it's already a police state, and so on!
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:44:41
By default (standard) you have zero in your wallet, but when mastered you have at least 1k in your wallet ahahahahah!
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:51:37
Brain is the best!
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:58:05
Exactly and people with a slaverish mindset continue to defend taxes, tremendous!
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:07:08
Then it's very strange why people continue to play government and state game, ahahahahah!
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:05:22
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:04:10
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:54:13
You're defo the heart of any party!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:50:40
Yeah, and the main criminals are printing the money anyways!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:46:40
Yeah, very fishy service!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:56:31
Nah, just got into my wallet to check, just 8640 sats, nothing!
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:01:10
Well, 70k green on my bank account!
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:32:02
Eleven what, thousands? Just eleven? Lamer!
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:49:20
Exactly, now see how sheeple will get at ya, ahahahahah, decentralizators, muhahahahahaha!
@_date: 2019-12-03 00:03:37
Coin.Space seems cool, you can export your private keys!
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:24:54
Exactly, if you careful!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:51:48
Forgot a sixth one: gamblers!
@_date: 2019-12-01 01:35:35
Well, then don't go to shit holes I guess!
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:50:25
Oh, that's pity, nah, I play with a little bit, like to turn 5 bucks into 500! I remember I won a bit over half of Bitcoin out of just 10 bucks worth of Bitcoin, that's all!
Plus he was playing at a very dubious service!
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:50:06
Russian traders - no fucks were given!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:50:04
Exactly, like money is, ha!
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:07:53
BadCrypto Podcast is the best!
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:12:38
The old and boring, slaverish talking point without any substance!
Read a country without taxes at least and give a holla to Tim Cuck and Jeffy Bezonos, they don't give a fuck about you and taxes!
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:52:40
Binance, Binance, oh well, Binance! CashApp to cash out or any other similar service depending on the country!
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:54:35
Yeah, fiat, can't print crypto, lol!
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:44:45
Ok, make taxes self-included for starters!
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:01:50
What do you think about Coin.Space wallet?
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:45:19
Then use them, they have a bunch of other cryptos on this wallet, what about those?
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:51:20
