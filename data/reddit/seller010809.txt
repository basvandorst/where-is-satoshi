**We've passed the point of no return...**
The damage was done the day the world discovered Bitcoin... not because 'Bitcoin' is necessarily the answer to all our woes or is a viable fiat alternative in an ever growing number of places. but because it completely changed the way future generations will think / talk about money...
The world financial system through greed and moral hazard had all but crippled us. After seeing this as a road block towards human advancement people (like Satoshi) decided to challenge the only system most of us have ever known... Years before we were playing with the idea of decentralised networks and their benefits and looking back it almost seems like logical evolution when you see the results, the most popular being Bitcoin!
The people understand now their are alternatives to this morally and financially bankrupt system and now the conversation has shifted from who to blame, to what am I going to do about it?
I was a late adopter hearing through a friend of a friend about 6 months ago but I'd heard about it years before and never took much notice... This is because like most people I grew up with this financial system, its the only one I know. But i was immediately drawn to the idea and spend weeks (now months) solid learning everything I can about not only the currency and the math but the idea behind it and how decentralising something can make it faster, more secure, and as some would call a 'by the people for the people' network...
This was a fundamental change in thinking for me, It was all i thought about for weeks and months... Not only about seeing decentralisation as an important step forward in computing and other aspects of life. But also it reminded me to stop looking for someone or something to blame... Instead ask "What are you going to do about it?"
**Success or Failure of bitcoin is no longer relevant!** - The shift of power from wealthy few to the slave majority is coming and all you need to do is tell someone **"There's another way!"**
"The hardest things to effect change are right in front of you..."
