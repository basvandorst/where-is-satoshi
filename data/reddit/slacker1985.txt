Bots are different than HFT algorithms. Those provide an unfair advantage for those who own them and use them effectively. Imagine being able to trade coins for fractions of a cent with absolutely 0 risk you'll lose money. 
Bots use the data presented and make a choice to buy or sell. HFT algorithms can act as a middle man between your order and the settlement of that order, getting you a different price than you saw on your screen when you clicked "buy"

I can understand that Bitcoin is the DOW, and other markets react. But this is simultaneous changes across at least 3 markets, all day, for 24 hours. Nothing is that quick to react except an algorithm used to detect trades and reacting before the buy/sell order is processed.

HFT is not a bot. Imagine this, and this is what really happens in the stock market today.
Your bot sees Bitcoin drop to 10,000/coin. It places an order to buy 1 coin at that price, since that's what you told it to do. There's an HFT algorithm owned by someone with a faster connection than you that "sees" your order to buy before it actually settles. That HFT algo then buys the coin, using it's faster connection, your coin at $10k, bumping the price up to $10,001, and that's what you end up settling at. The algo then sells that coin immediately at $10,001, netting a profit of $1, and dropping the price back to where it was. All of this takes place in a matter of miliseconds, and you would never know, because on screen, the price never changes. You just see you paid a buck more than you wanted to when you hit enter on your order.
Conversely, it also works with sell orders. You want to sell at 10k, the HFT algo sees your sales order and sells a coin at $10k first, and you settle out at $9999.
These huge drops/gains in a matter of seconds are all these automated trade bots fighting a losing war against a few people who are playing unfairly. 
Read "flash boys" by Lewis Michael to see how it effects the stock market. You'd be crazy to think the same thing isn't happening here.

 No, but the term is ambiguous. "Bot" to my old, inexperienced self means a program designed to execute your wishes. HF traders use "bots", for lack of a better term, to hijack trades using an unfair speed advantage to create an unseen arbitrage profit. I might be using the wrong terms.
