It definitely takes some balls to play! We love the comment, do you mind if we quote you on the site?

It's in our interests to run this thing legitimately ;) But we acknowledge the perceived risk, at least during the first month or so. We really appreciate the people who have taken a chance with us so far.
Money is not our main motivation here. We take a modest 3% fee, of course, but that wasn't why we made the website.
For us, we're fascinated by the idea: A high adrenalin game which is exciting for spectators and even more exciting for players. You can even play CoinBaller at a bar with cash, but I don't imagine those games getting nearly as exciting as Bitcoin games will get!

Really shouldn't have shared your winning strategy with everyone, you could stand to win big with those smarts!

Do you have any advice for us on the matter? It's not easy trying to launch a startup!

This is a genuine concern! And you're right, it does add a little extra mystery to the game, doesn't it? I mean, it's a game for high rollers right? You gotta have the balls to put your money up in the first place.
In all seriousness, however, we believe it makes more sense for us to establish a reputation as reliable game site owners. We do take a 3% cut, and it is in our interests to see many, many games play out (which wont happen if we ever run off with anybody's money)
