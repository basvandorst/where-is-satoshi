I still beat myself up everyday for not buying in 2015 when I first heard. 
Is it too late? Can we expect a crash soon?

Thanks for the quick response! 
So would you recommend buying small amount in different exchanges? for example some in GDAX and some in KRAKEN? Is there any benefit on this "diversification"?

The best thing about being in this game is that all the players think they know what's going to happen.... yet, nobody really knows.
For me, I hope it dips hard so I can buy more. I just got in with .03 at $6500

I’ve been considering starting to day/week trade to make some small gains. More for the “game” than to get rich. I don’t have a lot to play with but just trying to learn how to do it. I figured the news would dictate some of the market behavior but this aim to WS.
Any tips, will be much appreciated.

I spend other currencies on good and services.....  but I’m a “long run” investor. Not trying to make a quick buck.

We are very early in the crypto game, at this point there is no telling who will prevail. My point is that if you believe in the block chain tech overall it doesn’t matter if continues to crash, you are in it for the long run-to support the cause.
