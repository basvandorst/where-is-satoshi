Congratulations!  You can already display bitcoin using bits on coinbase.

Don't try and speak for an entire market and you will help limit your exposure to ridicule. 
  


  
Prove it.  A very sad fact is that various producers of illegal substances around the world will put more pressure on the system of production when demand rises and it is easier to move product, aka liquidity.  The very opposite of what you emphatically propose is more likely.

Whether or not hits actually happened, doesn't change the fact that he tried to have people murdered.  This evidence has already been presented in trial, we've seen it and there isn't much left to imagine in regards to Ulbricht's intent since he documented it so well.

I'm not complaining, I'd do the same thing if I was trying to promote my business using this subreddit.

Congratulations on your experience with your bank.  I had a similar experience a few years ago except it was inconvenient and I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and fax it in to my bank who then had to review it.  It was a major pain filled with stress but it had a happy ending.
  
The only way for them to make a purchase with your bitcoins is to control your bitcoins.
  
It depends on how they gained control of your bitcoins.  Just like cash, if you control your bitcoins when they are stolen, then you don't get them back.  But similar to your experience, if an online wallet loses them and they are reputable, they will re-inburse you.  We have already seen companies like Coinbase, Bitstamp and Blockchain do just that.  I don't believe they will re-inburse you if it is your fault but I expect even that will change to an extent as insurance starts catering to the crypto currency sector.  Bitcoin is still young and risk models are still being developed and it is still very difficult for bitcoin companies to get insurance.  Regular banks have guarantees from the government and there are a lot of insurance options for them.  It will take a while for crypto offerings to catch-up and compete in this area.  Remember, Banks have existed for centuries and have had a lot of time to refine their offerings, they weren't always so consumer focused and there was a time when robbing the town bank meant that the town lost money and didn't get it back unless they caught the bad guys.

"We _must_ build **decentralized** layered solutions on top of bitcoin, rather than stuffing everything into bitcoin itself."

They probably think the down votes are unfair, so they're leveling the playing field in their mind.  Most people have no clue that they're doing it but people who watch can see how obvious and blatant it is.  So for them, it doesn't matter as long as the majority don't notice\care.

No one?  The whole disk was encrypted.  Encryption doesn't help when someone gains physical access to the unencrypted volume.  Encryption doesn't protect you against your own stupidity.

It's all about the data, the data is the value.  Right now, people are being lured in with the promise that change tip won't sell their data.  When it is adopted enough, they will be bought by someone who will sell your data.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:42:04
See?  They kept their promise, they aren't selling your data. ;)

Maybe he does...

You say things that aren't true and are misleading.  You said that Ulbricht wasn't hurting anyone(he tried to have people murdered), you said that SR created a market where people don't get hurt, but you are disingenuous by limiting your scope to just the market of SR and not what it takes for the criminals to bring those drugs to market.  You don't appear to care how the drugs came to be on the market.  A market filled with drug dealers and hitmen.  If that is your vision of progress and peace, I want no part of it, and I want to see you fail.
