Thanks. If anything this just shows how important the flow of new Bitcoin into the market is to the price. If miners hoard coins, they will become more scarce and prices should rise. The halving makes coins more scarce regardless and forces everyone’s hand. Even if miners are hoarding coins now in an attempt to sell them later, it’s inevitable that scarcity takes over (whether from the 2020 halving or 2024, or after that) and price continues moving up. But history has shown us so far that one halving is enough to drive prices through the roof.

The pump seemed to correlate with this news:
The news seemed kind of bearish, but it also shows how little regulators understand Bitcoin and the ability to oversee ‘accounts’
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:41:45
You can’t compare the two. We aren’t in a bear market at all. We’ve had 5 green months in a row.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:41:52
I didn’t make that statement. I just know for a fact that this alone won’t kill Bitcoin. No one country can kill it. The entire globe would have to join together to ban it somehow— and that wouldn’t even kill it. If that were to happen, how could they truly prevent people from running the software? 24/7 surveillance? Bitcoin is far from dead.

Again, time and growth will decrease volatility.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:54:40
It’s happened twice before. Also stock/flow ratio.

Pretty clear we are in a downtrend right now. However, nothing has changed fundamentally and it’s funny to think that we live in a world now where $9,000 feels low and Trump/Congress talking about Bitcoin feels somewhat normal.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:22:26
And if it goes to 5k those people will be waiting for it to go back to 3k. And so on.

Baby’s first Bitcoin dip.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:32:01
This is a very common misconception. Compare the crashes of BTC today to those 5 years ago and you will see that they are less violent. The currency is only 10 years old and only has a $200billion market cap. The larger it grows, the less volatile it becomes.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:07:20
We had five green months in a row. People sell, take profits. It’s normal.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:43
I think most people are in agreement that there will be a correction here too, which is healthy, as was the dot-com bubble. The point is that the long term viability of Bitcoin should not be underestimated in my opinion because of the present day issues.
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:37:15
Do you really think some generalized threats made at crypto by some US politicians is the end of Bitcoin?

Half of the world doesn't have access to banks but most of them do have access to rudimentary smart phones. Bitcoin (or a form of cryptocurrency) would essentially bank the unbanked with the simple downloading of an app. Is there no value in that?
There are countries where the governments drive their countries currencies into hyperinflation and the citizens who thought they had $1000 in their savings account still do, but wake up one day and it is really worth $100. They instead could put their money into a global deflationary cryptocurrency just by downloading an app on their phone. Is there no value in that?
Some people live in countries with corrupt foreign dictators who steal peoples money. Some people live in countries whose funds are frozen in banks based on political beliefs when their money could be stored in a decentralized cryptocurrency, is there no value in that?
And so on, and so on. There are many more reasons why this technology is so astounding and why it will be a big part of our future. If it's not Bitcoin, it will be some other cryptocurrency that takes it place. But one thing is certain, cryptocurrency will not be going away. Feel free to have your opinions, but cryptocurrencies have already been around for a decade and the global market cap is growing, exponentially, by the year.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:15:44
Where did you read this? Also the parabolic moves upward historically don’t take place until about a year after each halving (see 2013, 2017).
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:47:04
Perfect storm today... Bitcoin exchange gets hacked, BCash gets released on Coinbase, and difficulty retarget settles in. Regardless, as much as I love BTC, it's quickly looking obsolete in comparison to these other coins. :(
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:09:34
We are still below all time highs from the 2016 halving. No way it’s priced in.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:53
Trezor already does have  a feature before you send BTC which allows you to change fees from 'high' to 'normal' to 'low', etc. and there is a 'custom' fee setting mode which the app says they do not recommend. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:40:16
Only invest what you are willing to lose. Bitcoin could lose 70% of its value or more in a day (it has happened before, in April 2013). Or, as you can see over the past week, the price can go up 70% (we just went from 10,000 to 17,000). We are still in the infancy of this technology and that comes with volatility and risk. As mainstream adoption grows, this volatility in the market should decrease. However, you should be fully aware that there are risks and those aren't going away in the near term.

Instability in Bitcoin reverberates to other altcoins though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:53:04
Yep, you can pretty much equate your fee to how quickly your transaction will go through. Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees first for obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:40:22
Right now 400 sat/byte is what is getting pushed through, but it looks like about 50% of transactions with 240 sat/byte over the past 36 hours have been getting confirmed... so hang in there I think.

It was always taxable as capital gains I thought?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:24
We are also still in the early stages believe it or not. Still dealing with wonky exchanges, just now gaining the attention of Wall Street and the media. It feels like the internet in 1999/2000. Bitcoin will catch up with the other coins via Segwit/Lightning Network just like the internet caught up from dial-up 56k modems to DSL/cable lines IMO. It'd be like dismissing the internet in 1999 for not being able to stream movies because it was just too slow. Give it some time. Bitcoin literally has the A team of nerds working on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:51:10
I read the article I think you're referencing... but I don't think they said it would be public 'any day' anywhere in it.

Fees are necessary because they are incentive for miners to perform the "proof of work" system that, in conjunction with a network of other miners, confirms that the transaction are real. Miners receive these fees in addition to the block reward that is usually discussed (ie 'mining for bitcoin'). Initially, and even as recent as a year ago, transfer fees were minuscule-- around 20 cents. But as the number of Bitcoin transactions has risen, miners began prioritizing transactions where users paid higher fees first. These fees have grown as transactions have grown. This is how we have gotten to this state. There are several solutions currently in the works on this, including SegWit and Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:35:38
They'll increase as long as transaction sizes continue to increase and Segwit/Lightning is not widely adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:15:17
Bigger block size is only a temporary fix. Andreas had a good talk on this. As Bitcoin transactions continue to grow, from 200k unconfirmed tickets to say 400k unconfirmed tickets, we'll find ourselves right back in the same boat. But I agree something like 2-4-8mb over a period of the next 5 years would be a good bandaid.

Half of the world doesn't have access to banks but most of them do have access to rudimentary smart phones. Bitcoin (or a form of cryptocurrency) could essentially bank the unbanked half of the world (3 billion people) with the simple downloading of an app. Is there no value in that?
There are countries where the governments drive their countries currencies into hyperinflation and the citizens who thought they had $1000 in their savings account still do, but wake up one day and it is really worth $100. The next day it's worth $1. There's no way out. They instead could of put their money into a global deflationary cryptocurrency just by downloading an app on their phone. Is there no value in that?
Some people live in countries with corrupt foreign dictators who steal peoples money. Some people live in countries whose funds are frozen in banks based on political beliefs when their money could be stored in a decentralized cryptocurrency, is there no value in that?

The internet eats up everything in its path eventually and I think you're still in denial about that. You kind of sound like one of the guys who could've been on the board of directors of Blockbuster in the 2000's. "Ha! Netflix. Who would ever stream movies over the internet!?"

Andreas if you’re reading this, I love you

Also, a successful miner collects a reward in the form of new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be collected if the miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of the rules of *consensus*. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin. Reading Andreas' Mastering Bitcoin helps answer a lot of these questions.
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:52:45
\^ Correct answer.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:51:08
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:32:12
Exactly. All of these computers (miners) are verifying that the correct protocol is being used. Since it is decentralized (tens of thousands, or more), the hacker would have a very difficult time.

It looks to me like we're trapped in another (milder) descending triangle. Since about 9/25. We need to break about $8,500 to break the formation.

There are some harsh responses in this thread. However, it's needed and nothing personal. Exodus doesn't require more than a single password. I don't think many people are comfortable with that low level security on $3,000+. 2FA is required at a minimum, and a cold wallet is recommended. There is plenty of education on this, and the more people that spread this message, the stronger the crypto community will be from hackers and scammers.

No. Free up to 10 withdrawals a month. After that they charge a fee.

Doesn't matter as Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places. It's possible we will live in a time where we measure things in Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:39:57
I think OP is referencing the 21 million maximum amount of coins. If you lose one of the coins mined out of the 21 million, it cannot be recovered.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:16:41
Blocks are mined at a rate of about one every 10 minutes, regardless of network hashrate.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:14:54
This hasn't been the case in past halvings. If miners leave, mining difficulty will decrease and others will join in and take their place.
@_date: 2019-09-14 00:12:51
The Bitcoin rewarded to miners for finding a block is cut in half every four years. In other words, every four years the supply of Bitcoin to the market is cut in half.
