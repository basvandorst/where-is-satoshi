If all of a sudden 3 out of 21 Mln coins gets back to being liquid your holdings inflate 14% this doesn't seem a little problem to me. And I'm not taking into account the image / psychological repercussions this would have on the markets.

Did you try paxful? I never used them though, be cautious.
If you plan to do this regularly, you should set up a real bank account or at least have one of those cards that also have an IBAN. Working with credit cards is dangerous, expensive or both.
PS: I 100% agree with If you want to cashout something, do it, but aim to increase your crypto stash overtime and forget the "get rich quick" mentality.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:44:32
You are talking about coins which have an owner of course. There is 1-3 Mln coins which currently *have no owner*. They are the problem.

If the ask price is 4000, you open a bid at 400 and then someone mistakenly opens another ask at 400, your order is matched and closed ONLY IF there are no better bids than yours, which in the mentioned scenario is quite unlikely.

Average block time depends on (difficulty / hashrate) . If the last blocks were solved too quickly the difficulty increases, otherwise it decreases so that the expected next block will take respectively more or less (expected) time to be solved given the same hashrate. Different coins aim at different block times, thus will apply different difficulties for the same hashrates.

Picking your 2-5 favourites among the top ten by looking into and understanding each project, and investing a small fraction of your money in still to be known cryptos is a much better strategy imo.

I did my research, thought about it, and converted a small part of my holding into a quantum resistant coin myself and came here to discuss. So far I've only met pissed off weirdos... maybe I touched a painful nerve?
edit: grammar.

Statistically speaking, if diff goes up you will have more hashes to try before finding a solution to a block (or smaller win chance for each hash you compute, see it as you like)
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:49:37
Like in the buying case, the only possibility you sell at 10x the price is the buyer adds an extremely huge bid AND there is no better ask offer before yours, which is pretty unlikely.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:49:24
I talk about unowned coins, you talk about your (owned) coins.

I've been reading about bitcoin since 2013 and haven't found answers other than those I posted.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:51:03
I'm not sure I understand. All Pub/Priv keys would have to be replaced. You can't make it "automatic" because otherwise owning an old Pub/Priv keypair would allow to move funds in the new addresses as well. We can't just forget about the frozen coins sitting in quantum weak addresses: we would have to either distribute them or freeze them forever by node consensus.
Please explain to me how would the fork you mentioned be carried out without requiring all the existing users to move their coins manually?

- Because there are customers out there who would like to spend bitcoin.
- Because as a seller you avoid any chargeback.
- Because on indexing services like Yelp putting "yes" on more things will raise your ranking score making your company stand out.
- Because if you prefer EUR or USD you can always sell the bitcoins you just earnt on an exchange at market price. Usually slippage + exchange fees are less than what you would pay using credit cards. Plus you avoid the risk of being charged back.

"b) \[...\] using a quantum computer, you can just acces the BTC in old addresses and transfer the funds to post-quantum addresses and then do with them as you please.".
This would not be possible because after the update any transaction coming from quantum weak addresses would not be propagated by the (updated) nodes. So even if someone stole funds from an old address, he could only use them in the old BTC blockchain, not BTQ. This solution anyways mantains the same problems as a) .

- Apps and integration aren't still really a thing. They will, and staff training will be sooner or later just as easy as with credit cards.
- Unconfirmed transactions won't be a problem forever:
if your business does small transactions (eg. ice cream shop) you can use a second layer solution like the Lightning Network (heck, even a crappy 0-conf would be enough imho); if your company does big or international transactions, then it is already preferable to only wait 20-40 minutes to get 2-3 confirmations and pay 0.5-5$ rather than waiting 1 to 14 days and paying whatever the involved banks decide you need to pay.

I don't like the idea of mixing habit tracking features in a wallet.
This said, I'm sure there will be more and more people willing to give away their privacy for some 'cool' features.
I'll just pass on this one.

I used them sporadically last year and everything once worked seamlessly. I remember being impressed how fast their website was.
Now its three months I trade almost everyday with them and I have to say the website is generally slow and sometimes it gets so overloaded glitches start to spawn, including:
-- Cloudflare may decide to block your connection for 10-60 minutes when you really wanted to cancel/open that order
-- General Lag
-- Positions madness. Just don't use positions on Polo until 75% of redditors tells Polo margin positions work. Lag can really screw you over and Polo cannot really be held responsible for being overwhelmed by customers IMO.
-- If something goes wrong, the customer care is pretty slow, but in my experience it will always help you out it just may take a 'long' time (longest I've waited was a week for my verification, the least 36 hours for a fucked up withdrawal which was succesfully refunded by Polo.

Bitcoin is way more mature, Eth is booming. IMHO it looks late to convert *most* of your BTC...
