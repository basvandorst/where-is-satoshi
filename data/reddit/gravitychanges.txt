Poor . . .  [Wayback link   &lt;---](  This thread was a great read, but I had to do a double take at the 17,500 btc when he was selling them all off at $1 a piece.  I understand he was still young and with his folks, 17k was a lot of money and we had no idea what they would go to, I just hope he saved a bunch.

I assumed the OP understood this person either didn't actually have any btc or has some, but no intentions of doing anything like this.  I suspect they are fishing reddit to see who they believe has a lot or some btc and putting out feelers for who is gullible.  Luckily OP was not the latter.

Unless you are prepared to drop ten thousand dollars or more, you won't really be able to mine many BTC.  In my experience when I came on a year ago, after seeing a move from CPU to GPU, even then GPU mining was getting slow.  Now you would need the large flagship and new ASIC rigs that are available.  Even that would be a big gamble because the difficulty is rising like a rocket (with said ASIC's releases to our competitors/friends).  
Right now I recently went in kind of light (under $500) and have a new(ish) ASIC and I've only made $60 in two weeks.  Come another two weeks I will be making much less each day (due to the difficulty) unless the value skyrockets on BTC.  My mining is worthless at this point even with ASIC, you need the big super-rigs and even then only hold a small window at this rate.  I would have been MUCH better off to just use the money on BTC at the time.

This was a great post OP.  
I believe you are absolutely right in everything you posited, but I feel like there are a lot of smaller auxiliary factors in play as well.  I wonder if the price having rose so high, leading to such greater international interest and fever dreams in many, will create a much higher floor.  I guess my musing is this, I wonder how many 'new' people that weren't investing fiat into BTC watched the 1000+ price and are now stepping in making small and frequent purchases presuming the price 'can' grow again and having found new faith.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:43:10

@_date: 2013-11-20 17:18:57
I am not mad at BFL.  I made a mistake in not purchasing BTC over mining equipment at the time, but that is my error.  They sucked at getting the devices out when estimated and I waited 10+ months, but live and learn.  I ended up with the 5.5 and it looked like I would never get ROI, but with BTC forecasts for the future it looks pretty good (still would have been better investing in BTC, but that was my fault not theirs).  So far mining 24/7 for 20 something days has yielded only 0.15BTC, but that is .15 more than nothing.  
It is kind of like falling for "As seen on TV" ads in the middle of the night.  Yea, it was expensive, yea it came late.  It isn't as WOW AMAZING as the commercial pumped me up for, but is it really their fault I bought that knife instead of making the smarter purchase.
As much as anyone here I understand that it took longer than advertised to ship and what that cost me.  However, I also believe whenever ASIC started shipping more en mass that difficulty bump would have occurred so unless I invented the ASIC box I was using, I never would have avoided it.

Me too.. It was depressing reading the stories here about the 200 BTC forgotten wallets and lost passwords.  I spent around 3 hours getting into a lost wallet for: 0.027 btc.  That effort was knowingly a bit of a waste of time, but I just didn't want to waste what little btc I was able to mine last April.  I love bitcoin too much to let that baby btc die from acquiescence.

I literally had the same thing happen to me after Silk Road went down- ordered 3 BTC after all the verification, 6 days later when it is much higher in price then finally let me know they cancelled it for the "high risk" deal..  sucks.  It took until today to finally hear back from their support and all they did was parrot the automatic email.
All the guys here though have tons of stories to tell that negate my initial opinion of them not wanting to sell when the price has more than doubled (in my case of those 6 days), but it felt that way to me, in the least it forced me to miss that buying window.  I haven't used them since.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:33:39

This would be the best advice I could give: many people here have great history with CoinBase.  I won't use them now because they burnt me, but hypothetically I believe they are likely a good company and supposedly future transactions aren't held hostage by the past error (ie: they should work).
Now that said, I would also recommend   It is a service you can buy direct from an individual.  One option is in person, but that doesn't work where I live in the rural south and I wouldn't prefer it.  They also have a banking escrow system.  You can send money from a service either online at the 3rd party services' websites or in person at grocery stores or wherever with moneygram, western union, etc.. if you don't wish to link your bank account.  You could also use your bank account or do a cash deposit at a chain bank.  With their escrow system, doing the transaction not face to face, it is just as safe as anywhere else (and often MUCH faster).  The drawback here is that there are small fees slightly more than CoinBase since you are paying both LocalBitCoins and western union or whatever AND individuals selling BTC can set their 'sell price' (also the advantage if you wish to be a day trader).  From what I've seen CoinBase usually is slightly more affordable, but you have to link bank accounts, they often take around 7 days, and they completely screwed my best opportunity (and a good one of yours) to buy BTC.  
That is the best advice I can give.  My only other advice is to buy BTC at opportune times instead of trying to mine like I did.  I ordered mining equipment a LOOOOOOONG time ago, finally got it last month and would have been SO much better off to just have bought BTC.
They say you learn from your mistakes, so I guess myself, a guy who got burned by BFL my first foray into BTC, then missed a great opportunity because of CoinBase... I should have at least a little bit of decent advice on what not to do.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:35:22

In fact the first article even talks of what I believe was also a Florida city SWAT who toured the nation like federal police doing reverse-stings and civil forfeiture.  They just had to pay the LE agencies who actually 'had' jurisdiction there a kickback.

Isn't defending against the bitcoin seizure a lost cause?  I understand the idea that if we say or do nothing in face of adversity we are 'allowing' it, but civil forfeiture in drug cases often has been government theft of parents' homes after their offspring was involved in a $20 weed stings.  If there wasn't any recourse available for that case in Illinois (or the thousands of cash, car, business, homes across the country) how can this lead to anything of value?
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:18:17
I haven't actually voiced any stake I've placed in btc yet.  It isn't really the focus of our debate.  I just wanted to inform him and challenge his views to see if learning more would alter his.  I value his opinion, but he isn't a technology guy and the older he got (this is true for me too) the more flexible perception of new things has been lost.  
Sorry you had that trouble, I can understand why you'd now choose to just avoid it.  There have been many things we've had to do that on in the past until we found common ground.  I'm trying to avoid having to dodge the subject by thoroughly explaining why I feel the way I do.  Tomorrow I'll show him my ASIC miner though when I have him to the house for dinner.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:31:13
Then was it 'really' a good thing?  It is a simple and fallible concept that "good things get better..." though if I were to say that a car I loved was a good thing- maybe my definition or judgment of 'good' was wrong if it doesn't last long enough to be what you consider "good."
I rather enjoyed this post, but I saw the "good things get better" more in line with the way polling the audience was never wrong in Who Want's to Be A Millionaire.  Bitcoin is out of direct control from those who control the world and directed 'by the people'.  Good things tend to be propagated, strengthened, and resurrected by those making good decisions and while an individual makes bad decisions, a large enough pool of decision makers nearly guarantees the best decision and judgment for good things.

Thanks for the replies and I am glad to hear that Coinbase didn't have any illigitamate motives at the time (based on your experiences my speculation was definitely off-base).
I contacted their support prior to posting on here, when they get back to me with a solution or explanation I will likely delete this thread as I have no intention of smearing an honest company (and from your experiences they certainly seem as such).  
Thank you all for your responses, you restored my faith in Coinbase.  I wanted to be able to use their service as my go-to exchange so after this gets sorted out I still likely will as you guys have faith in them.

I got registered.. Don't know if the BTC is still out there, but wanted to say that the browser looks pretty darn cool.  It is very easy to use and has some good apps for it.  On my desktop I prefer to stay away from Mac / Win8 type user interfaces and probably will stick with my more familiar ones, but I liked this one.  I think it would be particularly useful for people like my wife that like that stuff.  It seems very lightweight and worked well on my crappy internet and since you even had Reddit on there you get bonus points from me.

Honestly... I agree with you 100% here and would do the same personally.  My neighbor/friend is pretty unhappy with his situation and buying it in cash wouldn't change the fact that he could only sell it for 30k less than 165 now, BUT owning 'your' home is very different than just an investment and I believe in living as debt free as possible.  It's why I have been working hard to get this (my first home, bought in '11) paid off in another 10ish years.  I did get lucky on the deal though.  It was foreclosed on by the time the contractor finished and I was the first owner.  A home is most people's largest purchase, greatest asset, and biggest money-drain when renting or mortgaged.  So I definitely agree with you, sorry for being argumentative before.  
While the OP may or may not be in better standing in 1, 5, or 10 years leaving it in BTC (besides it being solely his choice) I agree and practice your point in owning one's home.

I can commiserate from other life-points with the rest of the family.  Yea this has been lighthearted.  It started as a few off-hand comments that led to more serious debate and then my comment in the first email when it was on my mind (still "debate" though and in no way pushing opinions).  Honestly, as a pretty old guy now I realize that I am in forever that five-year old "my dad's stronger than your dad" view.  He is a strong-willed and intelligent man that has an integrity and intensity I wish I had half of.  I couldn't force my views on him if I tried, but we are real close so we can have serious conversations that stay un-hurtful and lighthearted.

I picture mining to become less common as difficulty and payout increase and slowly more concentrated in power.  That said, if pooled mining becomes more and more common would that not mean less and less miners downloading the whole chain?  I don't have the chain, but I can still mine in a pool.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:06:38
So to clarify and update, I wasn't afraid to tell my dad about my interest / investment in BTC (which was too late and with a baby on the way not much).  I had him over for dinner last night and showed him my little 5.5ghz miner and how my wallets work.  I got the miner late (butterfly labs...  yea, I know, but I ordered it last February) and it still was able to pay for itself at least.  We don't attack each other for what we see as bad decisions, he was interested in it and didn't voice any opposition to my decision-- but I waited to show him when he was over here because if I'd told him before he would have either been more reserved or concerned and I just wanted to talk about btc aside from my faith or liabilities.

That is absolutely true, but worth/value is not tangible.
I didn't say that owning your home without debt is bad, I was referring to it being a sure-fire investment.  In my neighborhood I bought my home for $85,000 at the height of the housing collapse.  It was built in 2008 and my neighbor bought his near identical model in 2007 for $175,000.  He owes multiples more than I will ever pay for mine and mine will be paid off in 10 years.  Owning it outright will be amazing (and a good thing), but if my neighbor had bought his as an investment property he would sure be S.O.L. because his "tangible" home did not have "tangible" value (since there is no such thing).  This sounds silly and basic, but anything is only worth what someone will pay for it.  I can't say what BTC will be worth in a week, nor a home, but right now both have value and judging from past performance the BTC sure has more value and growth in the short term.

Well friend-  I need more information about this transaction to tell you!  There is a 99.9999999999% chance that our OP's transaction had a 0.000000000000001% effect on the market.  However, if he owned more than a few million dollars worth he could have had quite a surprisingly strong effect on the market at the time.  The irony though is I believe a large stakeholder like this example, SELLING like he said, would have lowered the price for BTC and not increased it.
