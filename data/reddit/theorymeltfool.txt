No, but I can absolutely trade in an old car for a partial payment of a new car. I’ve actually had a friend (who owns a repair shop) trade in multiple uses-cars in exchange for a brand new one. Used-cars have value.

I never said it *was* a scam. I was saying users of this sub are *treating it like a scam* by upvoting bullshit articles.

I mean, it mirrors the trajectory of every bubble ever, from stock tulips, to tech stocks, to housing, to Ponzi schemes, etc.

At least with the lottery you know your odds of winning (slim as those odds are). With cryptocurrencies we have no idea what’s going to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:24:39
Lol, read better
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:33:24


Well that too.
But the fact is if everyone held on to Bitcoin back then and didn’t trade them in exchange for money/goods/services, then the price never would’ve risen so much. So all stories like this are absolute bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:06:48
Lol denial of what??
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:32:43
Never said that... Although it is becoming more like that.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:32:15
How is it too expensive? You can buy portions of bitcoins right?
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:26:25
You’re right, and I’d love to be proven wrong. But I haven’t seen any evidence of early bitcoin successes in large numbers, so it appears that while some people made money, it ends up being a zero-sum game where *more* people lose money by selling prematurely and for less than what they paid. Therefore, at the current time, bitcoin doesn’t appear to be a financially prudent vehicle for *either* a store of value or an investment. Buying bitcoin at today’s prices -and while it’s still volatile- has more in common with a lottery than it does an investment.


O RLY? Mining rigs and electrify are free??

[Seems like more people are becoming aware of it and the potential consequences](
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:39:20
Sorry, not sure what else I can say. I’m still of the opinion that bitcoin is being promoted *like* a scam.
Here’s an example:
Stock investing is a relatively low risk investment if you take precautions, such as due diligence, research, diversification, etc.
But buying OTC/penny stocks and skipping the research can very quickly delve into scam territory.
Same with Bitcoins.
Does that make my position clearer?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:31:19
My stocks in NVDA and AMD have been doing quite well over the past few years, much more stable than bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:12:48
Agreed. Price growth should follow a S-curve, not a rollercoaster or hockey stick.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:57:12
Again, I’m pro-Bitcoin and anti-bitcoin scammers 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:49:07
Yeah, because if *everyone* has hoarded bitcoins, then they wouldn’t be worth any real money because none of them would have been exchanged for cash/goods/services. 
The odds of someone being a “millionaire” from being an early minor/investor are about 1 in a million. So saying “you could’ve been a millionaire” is like saying I could’ve been a millionaire if only I had purchased more lottery tickets.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:41:30
Yup, [exactly what I was saying about this the other day](
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:46:04
If it was Microsoft, then yes.
If it was a Wall Street firm, then no.
Hence my statement “like a scam”. So are we in agreement yet?
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:38:28


That’s false.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:10:50
I never said bitcoin *was* a scam, I was saying that upvoting bullshit articles like this make it *seem like a scam*, i.e.[ it relies on bagholding to grow as an “investment.”](
Bitcoin purchasers shouldn’t be looking for large increases/decreases. The more bitcoin flatlines and *maintains* (and slightly increases), the better it will be as a store of value and will then gain much wider acceptance.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:32:18
If *Back to the Future: Part II* had Marty buy “cryptocurrency” or some other type of future investment (mimicking bitcoin) people would’ve lost their shit.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:09:49
Lol, you didn’t explain shit. You obviously don’t understand it except on a very short term view of “Bro it’s going up and it’s going to keep fucking going up forever!!” So whatever, if you’re so smart put all your money in bitcoin and tell me off in 50 years when you’re a billionaire or whatever. 
The reason why you’re so mad is because *you know* bitcoin relies on new people to buy in order to keep the price going up. Which is the same fucking thing as a pump-and-dump stock scam.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:47:37
Lmao, fuck off ya creep
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:12:12

Stocks offer returns based on performance, profits, and dividends. 
Bitcoin relies on being sold at a higher price.

I’d like to see what’s more energy intensive: gold mining or cryptocurrency mining. Especially now that block chains aren’t cracked as often.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:50:03
I mean, like any form of exchange there are pro’s and con’s, but with bitcoin too many people are ignoring the negatives and promoting to people as a surefire investment, when it’s still a speculative investment. And if it gets too expensive then that could create more competition with other crypto-currencies which would saturate the market and lead to bubble-like conditions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:32:19
Exactly. Re: [bagholding](
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:06:52
The way this sub promotes stories like this makes me think you all know bitcoin is a scam, and you want more “suckers” to buy so that you can cash out based on the “fear of missing out.”
Edit: thanks for the (mostly) good discussion. I’m not anti-bitcoin, I’m anti-pump-and-dump, anti-scam, etc.

[Here's his site.]( Is his name really "Rob in the Page Family"?


Huh? So, you're saying he specifically doesn't follow zoning laws? Which ones?


The Earthship concept seems completely compatible as far as i can tell: more earthships in an area = Earthship Cohousing. Seems much better as far as I'm concerned, as it allows for specialization within the community, which allows for more time for other pursuits.
Do you actually read this guy's blog though? He sounds [kind of conspiratorial if you ask me.]( 
@_date: 2012-11-06 19:46:02
What does this have to do with living in Cohousing? I guess people could use gold/silver or whatever else they wanted too.
@_date: 2012-11-06 20:11:18
Ah, i see, that explains his name.


As long as the housing is zoned 'residential,' which it most likely is in a rural area, and he's not using electricity in an unsafe way, then he's likely not breaking any laws.


I think this is total bullshit. Unless he broke a law, went to court, and got the Jury to nullify the law (jury nullification), he's not doing anything except working within the current construct of the law.


Or he's a charlatan that is charging [**$20/month** for bullshit information that is readily available on any government website.](
I don't know, but for the time being I'll be staying away from his bullshit. Thanks for mentioning his site though, *certain* aspects seem interesting, while the rest is pseudo-philosophy that isn't worth anything. I'll have to check out a few videos tonight before commenting further.

If Krugman thinks it's bad, I better buy more.  I swear, by doing the opposite of what this guy has said I've had the best investments for years now. I divested when he said we weren't in a housing bubble, and I never bought a house because him and Bernake said it was a sound investment. I also maintain portfolios with actual gold, silver, stocks, and now bitcoins.  I can't thank this high-profile idiot enough.

IT sure is a lot of money for such a worthless comment. For $18 I could buy several books, a few songs on iTunes, maybe even a ticket to a local music venue.

@_date: 2013-12-05 16:22:36
Because treating money in such a cavelier way is akin to not treating it with much respect. 
I suppose it's not a big deal because it's potentially a way to "pay it forwar," but then bitcoin isn't used for economically productive trade, just trade between people that also have bitcoins.
In order for it to become a widely used, viable, and less volitile currency, it will have to be used on transactions that generate economic wealth, not zero-sum transfers between people.
@_date: 2013-01-08 19:50:30


I don't think I said that?




But this contradicts your earlier statement of:


...Which is what I was responding to. I know venture capitalists and angel investors exist.


Sorry. You're right, I didn't convey my message very clearly due to not differentiating between a central bank (Fed) and commercial banks.


No reason to be a dick.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:24:47
That's quite disengenuous, and a sign that an anonymous currency has a long way to go before being widely accepted if people like yourself can commit blatent fraud and not get away with it.

Agreed, I think there are certainly benefits for people who own legitimate businesses, who also want to avoid fees charged by credit card companies and banks.
But it's also very popular (and some would say necessary for) use by people who post goods/services for sale for illegal items, like on silkroad.


Welp, guess I'm an asshole then...

Every few weeks? O RLY? If what you're saying is true, then that's between $336-468/year. After 20 years at 5% growth, that would be a loss of $17,490 after 20 years. You're right, it's literally nothing..... s/

Because it's a waste of money...
@_date: 2013-01-08 18:08:52


Except for the people who's purchasing power gets eroded, since inflation is usually between 3-6% (or more, depending on the commodity), while most savings accounts pay a paltry return of 0.25% (or less). The different between the inflation rate and the return on the investment is the amount that the Fed and Government are able to make off of people, which is why inflation is usually touted as an 'unseen tax.'


Just because banks have a current monopoly on lending and finance, does not mean that it is the only entity that should have that right. If banks didn't have a near monopoly, peer-to-peer lending would be much cheaper, since you'd be able to cut out the middleman and overhead (all those banking skyscrapers) and go directly to people that needed money.


But the reason why you get *so little* return is due to banking overhead, and inflation.


I'm not sure I understand this statement.
