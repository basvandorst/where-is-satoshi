You might be in a state that doesn’t allow a use wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:47
I’d do that too! Can’t you just put in usd wallet then buy btc? Or ar you in a place where you don’t have a usd wallet?

Based off the comments I thought this was a buttcoin thread.

I unsubbed fro Bch subreddit long time ago... less complicated now.

Did he declare it? Somalis have been collecting welfare in Mn then bring it back like 1 million at a time to Africa. All they do is declare it and they can walk it through. 
Civil forfeiture is a crock. Was made to take down drug kingpins but now the police use it to roll everybody and find their departments.

I was a silverbug, still am, but had I put half of it into btc a few years ago I’d be quitting my dead end job. Just this last week converted some of my ag to btc at a capital loss as I believe in the upside of bitcoin. Now to hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:08:09
Seems legit!

If your name is a reference to the rapper, change it to Shaggy USMC. Dat boi served.

10$ in btc for both of youonce they buy 100$ in crypto. You have to log in on a pc to find your referraL link, can’t find it on the app.

Baby steps. I opened with the scam of fractional reserve banking, the crash of 2008, and did name drop Satoshi’s whitepaper. Main lesson given was the limit of 21m vs the number of people on the planet. Hopefully it doesn’t tank and we don’t have to discuss the terms bear trap or dead cat bounce.

I blame chuck e cheese and loot crates in video games. Thanks for your perspective.

Harsh, and all dem gainz bro. I’m hoping Robinhood opens soon for crypto, sick of the coinbase drama.

I make my gamer tag bitcoin related in every game I play to create discussion. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:29:36
Dump your bags on pm for sale at a small discount to a payer who will pay in crypto. I did. Was liberating, or libertading? Silverbug joke!
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:01:47
Very nice and fun to read thank you!
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:37:58
I got my nephew 20$ worth, posted it here, and got lots of hate. Good on you for allowing it. Don’t bet the bank on it but all of you getting 100 and riding the wave is a great bonding and learning experience.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:54:58
Another fun thing is getting them into dogecoin. 10$ for each kid would make them a multi-thousandaire and they would be able to mess around with that. 
Get them the dogeminer app or play the game online. Mine them fake doges.
Also get them each a blockfolio app so they can track them gains. Have fun bitcoin brah. Go post over at maybe they will get your spawns their first doge. Pm me when you do! Cheers.

Lol. I was at a football game today and was trying to remember the cheer she did. Koth is the best show ever aired.

4-10% over spot or a flat fee per traction. Less chance of scam and storefront grants legitimacy instead of local bitcoin/coffee shop meetup. Local guy I know of was a buck higher than Coinbase price, but said no kyc under 3k. So a good place to buy for 1-2k deals. All he does is buy from sellers at spot then resells with his markup from bitstamp. He’s been in business for 2 years so I guess it’s working out.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:10:16
That’s cool do you have a link or a subreddit?

I’m such a cuck, right. I wanted her to go all in with the kids savings. She’d rather leave it in bank at 1.2%
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:35:37
Nice plan Stan. Wish wife would let me do it for my kid. She won’t budge and I know she’ll regret it.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:20:45
Underrated reply.

Hodl on for one more day. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:15:53
I think it was percent of the bitcoin supply, not actual wealth. What number of btc do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:48:50

Original wallet.dats weren’t encrypted by default. Later on they were, or more people enabled it. So if you got a hobbyist who was just dicking around with the original software usually wouldn’t be encrypted.  A later edition would be. At least that’s how I Understand it.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:54:00
4 years old thread. Apparently they bbecame encrypted after awhile so you’d have to find some in the sweet spot. Always worth picking up old throwaway towers and laptops and doing a scan for a wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:21:04
Thank you!

Dollar cost averaging. Buying a set amount at regular intervals regardless the price. Over time you will have an average cost spend per unit. So if you bought some at 20k and some at 3.5 k  your average would be 11750. But if you are consistent you’ll keep accumulating. But with prices this low if you buy more than you usually would your average would drop even further. But that’s gambling.
