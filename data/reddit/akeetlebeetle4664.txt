6 confirms are the standard. However, you should have already seen it in armory (having not used that program, I don't know if it needs to download the entire blockchain first, which can take many hours.)
I just saw another post here asking the same thing (about the access to your program.) I personally wouldn't allow it until it's given the all-clear, but that's just me.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:43:24
Not really an "optimist" per se, just a realist. There are many Bitcoin users who will never stop using bitcoins unless the protocol is completely shut down (and even then they would revive it).
It has never been and will never be worth $0. Fractions of a cent? Possible. Nothing? Very, very unlikely.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:06:03
I'm confused. Don't all bitcoin addresses start with a 1? Is this just for changetip?
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:26:39
I downloaded Multibit about a month or so ago. It keeps the blockchain off my computer. It auto updates.
I've heard of mult-sig addresses, but I've never actually seen one before this. Why did they go this route?
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:15:37
I tried to send to that address and it wouldn't go through. I had to set up a changetip account and do it that way.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:52:52
...and ship it in two weeks.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:36:06
I've been in BTC since it was $8. I have NEVER seen BTC or Doge addresses that started with those numbers. I tried sending the money through Multi-bit and it wouldn't take.
So, I ask you again, how do you send that Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:58:57
I got one like this yesterday. To my recollection it didn't say anything about Coinbase, it looked like a straight-up spoof of Gmail.
However, I wouldn't be one bit surprised that it was targeting Coinbase account holders.

@_date: 2014-12-11 23:56:36
At the moment it's tied to fiat. 1 BTC is currently worth ~$350. It's been as high as $1,100 (don't remember the exact number) and as low as &lt; a penny.
One of the first major transactions (proof of concept if you will) before Bitcoin hit it big was a guy paid some stranger on the Internet 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas.
Obviously you can buy a hell of a lot more pizzas now with 10,000 BTC. So, it's a catch-22. If he had never made that infamous purchase (which was only like $20 out of his pocket), Bitcoin may never have caught on (or much slower). The reason is the same as people saying that you would never 3-d print a car. Now that it's becoming a reality, 3-D printing is taking off.
People saw that Bitcoin was more than just magic Internet money and responded appropriately.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:39:45
I'm sure Western Union has to have a money transmitters license. So, too, would any BTC company who wanted to dip their foot into the pool.
However, that may not be necessary as Paypal is close to allowing users to send BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:39:20
I traded Auroracoin a day or two ago. I also have more than 1 comment in my history. It exists, but it is also heavily pre-mined (50% I think), so take that for what it's worth.

@_date: 2014-12-12 00:39:50
There is no formula. Simply put: it is worth what the people buying/selling believe it is worth.
How much is gold worth? Sure, you can use it in practical applications, but there is no set price that it will forever remain.
With fiat, you usually have to consider inflation (my $1 will be worth less than that in a year from now). Bitcoin is the opposite. As there will ever only be 21 million bitcoins, its value will go up (as more people adopt/use it). It will, of course fluctuate wildly in its first few years/decades as all new money does. But - unless the Internet dies - it will never truly be worthless.
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:30:13
I asked them about fees and such and they said they were still working that out. They're 4-6 weeks away from deploying the first cards.
Depending on how they handle fees, this may be the next revolutionary step for Bitcoin.

I did. I purchased the coins, sent what I needed and moved the rest. No where (that I know of) does it say that your personal details will be divulged when sending coins.
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:09:28
I've been around Bitcoin since coins were $7. I knew Coinbase tracked bitcoins, but this is the first I've heard of them going Paypal on us and divulging names. Why not just give them our addresses and SS too?

@_date: 2015-01-30 01:47:11
So how does that work? Does it just remove the word or the whole post/comment from your view?
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:35:12
One of the best things to happen to Bitcoin is as people are being introduced to Paypal's bullshit tactics. At the same time, they're learning about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:18:46
Thank you. I've always wondered that too.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:58:51
That's cool, man. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:38:08
So who's buying then? When one person checks out, another takes his place. In the end, regardless of the price, Bitcoin is still here. You're just going to have to get used to it.
Look, I get it, you missed the boat and you're angry that you didn't get a piece of the pie. With the price drop, however, you can rectify your mistake and jump in. Don't make the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:36:05
Which is the whole idea from what I gather.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:27:23
It was $7 when I first started mining. I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying (and holding) more at that price.
I think if it reached $5 again, that would signify that everyone's lost confidence in it. There's too much money on the sidelines for it to ever drop back down that far.
@_date: 2015-01-25 01:59:59

I'm pretty sure they have to register as a MSB in each state. Every state has their own fees to do so. They probably just picked the cheapest (or most financially lucrative) states to start with.

He's sending to an actual bitcoin address, but it's owned/controlled by Coinbase. If he sends that from his Coinbase account, she now has his real name.
@_date: 2015-05-14 00:43:12
Right. Apparently, if you send money from one Coinbase account to another (and you won't always know it's a coinbase account you're sending to), they'll tell them your name.

That makes sense. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:44:31
Judges have ruled that IP addresses can't be used to finger someone. Multiply that X 100 for specific bitcoin addresses. Unless you broadcast your address or link it to Coinbase or something, they'd have to have a warrant to see if it actually belonged to you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:12:29
Just in case.

No. Paypal has nothing to do with bitcoin. They are doing this separately. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:25:33
I assumed we'd have a bit of warning and a hard-fork could (hopefully) fix the issue. Those who have lost their funds might then be able to recover them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:51
You're confused. Paypal is also rolling out a same-day transfer program.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:14:08
How can we find out what percentage they've gotten?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:08:22

I believe BTC actually goes out to 12 decimals.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:23:33
It's being rolled out. I've also been a customer for years and have to wait 10 days (it's actually getting longer).
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:37
Hell no. That's just CB being dicks. If paypal can get me my money same day, so can CB.

Believe it or not, they actually did it on purpose. They chose not to defend very well because they knew that over the course of a game they could outscore 98% of their opponents.
They used their superior offense as their defense. It worked perfectly except for the playoffs where they were ground down and matched up against opponents who knew their tricks and could defend against them.

I'll tell you a secret. If it was ever found out that a company like BFL began mining with the equipment - and it wouldn't take long to figure it out - the Shit would hit the fan so hard and Bitcoin would tank like a stone.
Bitcoin is based on trust. That's also why it's vital that we limit one miner to &lt;50% of the hash.
No one minds if they "break in" a few asics to make sure they perform as expected, but they would NEVER just mine with them for profit.

It's been reported that the Chinese are heavy into investing/saving.
There are many reasons why people buy into bitcoin as there are many reasons people buy the dollar or euro. What the speculators do really doesn't affect what the savers/gamblers/users do.
Why is gold so expensive? Sure, it has some utility, but it was mainly investors/speculators that drove the price up.
I think the most important reason that people are buying Bitcoins is that it is (in theory, anyway) a much-improved money transmission/storage/whatever concept than what the world has currently.
Right now, every country has their own rules and regulations and banks and whatnot to control the flow of money. Wanna get some money to the starving kids in Africa with the traditional banking system? Good luck with that.
Bitcoin breaks down world barriers.
Now that people are beginning to "get it" you're seeing adoption. This is just the beginning.

Lastly, perhaps (since you already have a ledger) you could add a running total of win/loss. That'd be great.

You're doing a lot of "what if's" here. 
This is a bitcoin address: 1FqSANzJMCDaw47cCR8R42JqGiALmqV4as
If you take the number to blockchain.info, you can trace any money that has been sent to/from that address all the way back to the original mined block(s).
As far as SR in concerned, it all depends on if you have identified yourself with that address. You can even send your coins to a third party to be "mixed" (integrated with other user's bitcions) before sending it on. I believe the Feds have stated that there are many SR users who are out of their reach because they can't identify them from their wallet address.
That being said, there *can* be a trail if you're not careful. However it's as anonymous as you want it to be.

The best online place to store coins is blockchain.info.
Coinbase is a great place to purchase (and sell) BTC, but a poor place to store it.


Think of it like a bank account vs cash. Your money is more secure in a bank than in your house, but you must have proper ID/pin/card/etc to obtain it (ie, the key).
When it's in your possession, you still have the key, but you have to be more careful as there are trojans and whatnot that will steal your coins. Make no mistake, however, through poor computer security, coins can be stolen from online wallets too.

People will tell you to not order now because they:
1) Don't like BFL.
2) Have a horse in the race (they have an Avalon/large GPU farm/BFL order)
3) Just like to cause FUD.
Take your pick.
I've done the math and the difficulty would have to be insane for you not to make anything, regardless of when they ship.
Anyone who tells you that you won't get your order before 6 months is a straight up liar. It may be 2 months or 4 months (unlikely), but no one (not even BFL at this point) really knows for certain.
Here's what we do know (about the jalapeno): it uses 30W (about the amount as a light-bulb). As long as you can mine more in BTC than you pay for a light bulb, you can turn a profit.

The new amount of bitcoins generated will slowly decrease and within a decade or two be negligible. Yes new BTC will still be produced, but in smaller and smaller quantities (IE, halving to zero each time, getting infinitesimally smaller and smaller, but never really reaching 0). 
The end point may be in the 2100's, but the point at which we can stop relying on new BTC being minted is going to be much shorter.

No, because it's just as likely that the original coins were purchased/mined for a cheaper price and used when inflated, thus giving a discount already.

It's a decentralized, very low cost, frictionless, world-wide payment system/store of wealth/currency that can be used by anyone (who has purchased or acquired BTC), anywhere at anytime (no banking hours) without having to request permission from banks/government to move their own money.
It is (mostly) anonymous and governments around the world are trying to figure out what it is and what to do about it. No one owns "the bitcoin network." The protocol is 99.99% hack proof and every transaction that has ever been made is recorded on a digital ledger for all to see (just digits that show where the money came from and where it went, nothing identifiable unless you link yourself to your bitcoin address.)
TLDR: Bitcoin can, in many ways, be considered digital gold. I like to think of it as the people's money.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:53:39
Except if he hadn't done that (showed the world that bitcoin could be used for real world stuff) there would be no $300 bitcoins now.
He took bitcoins from the proof of concept stage to reality. That, imo, is worth FAR more than $3 million. Bitcoins would probably still have taken off, but it would have taken much longer or someone else would have come up with the same idea.
@_date: 2013-02-23 00:00:13
I just wanted to check back in and give my update.
1) I LOVE the new deuces wild look. Is it just my mind playing tricks on me or did you also change the look of the cards?
2) I like how responsive and professional the whole thing is. I've played others and they were slow and clunky.
3) This next point is probably the most important - Thank you for highlighting our winning combos (or sum of cards in blackjack). This makes a HUGE difference (especially when you've been playing a while). Believe it or not, some don't offer this.
Suggested changes:
- We like our satoshis. Please let us cash out our entire balance (above the transaction fees). We'll come back, we promise :)
- Allow me to bet (up to your max) how much I want. Specifically on the low end. Right now the min bet is ~3 pennies. I would like to be able to bet a penny (I'm a cheap bastard, right?) Right now I'm only betting 1 coin (.001), but if it was lowered to 1 penny, I would be more willing to put in the 5 (giving you .005/pull compared to .003).
- I really don't see the necessity of having a Facebook/Tweet button after every 3c win. Most of us will probably want to remain anonymous anyway. Perhaps you could replace that with the counter (with an option to reset it).
Anyway, I just wanted to give you my feedback, because I really like what I see and only want it to get better.
I also like how you are given a random nickname, but can change it anytime. Mine is Beast.
Thanks for a great game and thanks to the OP for showing it to me. I followed his link so he should get a bonus (I haven't looked into that aspect yet).
Oh, I did find one bug. When cashing out, you are given the choice to tick a couple of boxes (basically withdrawing the entire amount and sending it back to the sending address).
It works fine except it remembers the last amount you sent. So if you have .5 BTC and want to cash it all out, but last time you cashed out .3, it will remember (auto populate) with the old amount. This was fixed by checking and unchecking the box. Small thing, but if you're not paying attention...
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:36:34

It's very unlikely you will see that card before the end of the year. When you do get it, the difficulty will have skyrocketed (even more) and your BTC that you paid *would likely have been* worth much more than the miner is worth. Remember, diff goes up (could go down, but not likely for awhile) every 10-14 days. 
If they had it in stock and were legitimately shipping right now, then you (and everyone else) should go for it. Otherwise, hold your BTC.
If you have to mine now (not necessarily for profit), CEX.io is your best bet. There is no equipment to buy and they have market orders so your hashing power is always worth something (probably less than what you paid). With CEX, you can get as much or as little as you want and re-invest some or all as you get your payouts.
Good luck.

Thanks for the reply. No, I'm talking about a running counter for that session - on the main screen. You already track the wins/losses, so it shouldn't be that hard to total them up. Would be cool to keep track like that.
As far as the card options, perhaps when you load into the room you could be presented with a short list (say 4) of design options for the card deck. The plain-jane look really turned me off.

Basically, yes. 5,000 satoshis is a penny right now. It would probably take a month of mining on a CPU to hit that right now. 
To put it in perspective, I purchased 2 upgraded Jalepenos back in april (7gh each) when the difficulty was &lt;10m. When I got them, it was nearly 300m. At then-current prices (of course I knew I wouldn't see it for a while - I was hoping for June/July at the latest) I would have made $145/day. Now I make $3.7.

I agree. This whole "let's scare the new players away so we can make more profits" has been going on for at least a couple of years now.
 I was told as a newbie back when the difficulty was extremely small that GPU mining was dead.
Then it was deader than dead when the reward was cut in half.
Then the price shot up and suddenly it wasn't dead.
Now the price has settled and it's dead again.
Geez, I wish other people would make up my mind for me so I can know if it's dead now or not.

I'll give you a perspective. I'm GPU mining, too. When the price was $10/11 and the difficulty was 2 mill, I thought that as soon as the ASICs came on the market the price would dip to $8 or even less.
As we all know, that didn't happen. The difficulty tripled, however the price has multiplied by 10. We are actually making more (dollar wise) now - after ASICS have been released - than we were 2 months ago.
My point is, no one really knows where the price of bitcoin is going. It could stabilize here or rocket up to $500 by summer. This is the unknown factor that I'm talking about.
Everyone who says that GPU mining will be unprofitable soon is not thinking 4th dimensionally.
Lastly, I started mining when the price was $7. I mined for a while (cashed it all out) and the difficulty crept up (to 400k I think) and then I stopped because it wasn't profitable.
But what if I had kept mining all this time and just not sold for $10-$20? What if I would have mined (at a loss/very small profit) and held on the BTC? What would they be worth now?
This whole thing is not simply a black and white problem. There are many facets to contemplate.

First, you don't see anyone else's bets. JD has many bets per second and they're not all shown, but it would pretty much be impossible to have only 1 user's bets be shown.

There's not much you can do with a stock (other than trade it). Bitcoins can be used for a variety of things - it is its own ecosystem. You can purchase things with it, send it to friends/relatives, invest it, save it, play the market with it. The list is endless.
A stock on the other hand is just a (valuable) piece of paper (although you don't even get that anymore).
@_date: 2013-02-15 21:20:26
It's a hard-coded limit put in place by the original developers. However, it will take many, many years to reach that (reward keeps halving after so many blocks have been mined - meaning that we'll keep getting closer and closer to 21m, but not reach it for (I think over a hundred years).
That's why there's 8 decimal places. 1 BTC too expensive? Buy .1 or .01 or whatever.

That's the trouble when anyone and everyone can steal from your account - including the banks.
Ever had a double charge? Or a service that continued to take money out of your account when you didn't authorize it? Yeah, we all have. What about when you get gas and they put a $200 hold on your account (without your permission) for $50 bucks worth of gas. I've had that happen and when you're not expecting it, things can wrong.
I have opted out of having my bank overdraft me. Guess what, they still do.
Try taking a large amount of cash anywhere - especially to an airport and see what happens. If it's not illegal to own cash then why do cops/TSA confiscate your money? They don't have to have a reason, either. YOU must prove that you didn't do something wrong (which, BTW is against the constitution).
BTC has none of those problems.


I assume you meant don't there. I don't use bitcoins or cash for illegal purchases/goods. If you don't care what other people do with cash then why do you care what other people do with bitcoins?


You are right that bitcoins are too volatile, but then again so is gold? How many have bought in at the height and lost their shirt?
You don't have to use bitcoin for a currency. Bitcoins advantage is that you can do anything you want with them without big brother (or big sister depending on which side of the pond you're at) telling you what you can do with YOUR money.

It's a decentralized, very low cost, frictionless, world-wide payment system/store of wealth/currency that can be used by anyone (who has purchased or acquired BTC), anywhere at anytime (no banking hours) without having to request permission from banks/government to move their own money.
It is (mostly) anonymous and governments around the world are trying to figure out what it is and what to do about it. No one owns "the bitcoin network." The protocol is 99.99% hack proof and every transaction that has ever been made is recorded on a digital ledger for all to see (just digits that show where the money came from and where it went, nothing identifiable unless you link yourself to your bitcoin address.)
TLDR: Bitcoin can, in many ways, be considered digital gold. I like to think of it as the people's money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:29:53

To be honest, I'm actually supportive of him "bullying the bullies" as it were. This bullshit notion that "the customer is always right" is nonsense and leads to abuse.
Everyone has a right to defend themselves - especially on an open forum. Just because he's part of a company now doesn't give people the right to walk all over him with no recourse.
How many cashiers and other retail workers would put up with the abuse given them if they knew for a fact that they wouldn't be reprimanded/fired. To answer that question, one need only visit I've watched this whole BFL thing unfold. Here's what it comes down to:
* You (collective you) bitch when he says something
* You bitch when he doesn't
So it comes down to do you want to take the red pill (and remain silent pissing everyone off) or do you take the blue pill and say something that may come back to haunt you (thus pissing everyone off)?
I think that in the beginning they actually believed their supplier's/fab's timeline and thought that nothing could go wrong. When things got dicey, they kept giving the "soon/2 more weeks" spiel to buy themselves more time. I don't think, however, that any of them actually believed that they would barely be shipping in June of 2013.
Did they do all this to intentionally deceive anyone? That's a tough call. Neither you or I were there and so all of this is speculation. It may look that way, but there are (for example) a lot of people behind bars because it looked like they did it.
So by you popping into these threads and spreading FUD (trying to save the unwashed masses from spending their hard-earned fiat), you are like those Jehovah's Witnesses who come to everyone's door. Don't ya know, they're just trying to save your soul from eternal damnation?

If you want to mine now, I suggest CEX.io/Ghash.io (one is where you purchase the hashing power, the other is the mining operation.)
For decent prices (sold on a stock exchange style) you can get any amount you want (even micro amounts) and be up and running automatically within seconds.
You still may never see a profit, but you can sell your shares any time, though you may take a loss. They're the second biggest pool, so they have no trouble finding blocks.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:25:38
Mining, at this stage of the game, is a losing battle. You will NOT make money mining with your computer (even with the USB sticks - although if you have one, may as well mine with it).
Bitcoins will "run out" as there will ever only be 21 million mined (and we're half-way there).
Your best bet right now is just to throw some extra money into Bitcoin and sit on it. More and more places take it every day, so if you see something you want and they take bitcoin, grab it.
Make sure you understand bitcoin storage safety. YOU are the bank and you must be certain that you have no viruses or trojans which can steal your coins. 2-factor everything, use strong passwords and hold on for the wild ride.

In a way that's not true. Bitcoins are "backed" up by the blockchain. I can redeem them anytime I choose to anywhere I wish.
The value of said item is decided upon by those who choose to exchange their coins in and out of fiat.
Take silver certificates for example. Sure, you could (in the past) exchange your dollars for silver. But what are you getting? A lump of silver. What's it worth? Only what people are buying/selling it for.
Is a lump of silver intrinsically worth any more than a block of digits? Not really. It's digital goods vs solid goods. Email vs snail mail. Fifty years ago no one really even dreamed of email and so snail mail was preferred. Now, it's the opposite. Very few use the postal service for personal letters.
The same will one day be true of bitcoins (and other ecurrencies) - why use cash/cards when you can take advantage of something that is inherently better?
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:21:24

What part of this did you not understand? When the dollar first came out it was not widely accepted and very few merchants took it. Did that mean it couldn't grow? No, of course not. Bitcoin is the same thing.
In Africa the number one currency there is phone cards. Do you see the potential? Phone cards. Third world people have cell-phones. You can use Bitcoins with cell-phones. Are you starting to see a picture?
As far as hoarding vs investing. I see plenty of bitcoin businesses springing up. Don't you? That means people are investing. Besides, what business is it of yours what people do with their damn money? If they want to invest, let them invest. If they want to hoard or gamble or whatever, leave them alone to do it.
That's the beauty of bitcoin. I don't have to have a backwards economy to FORCE me to invest my money - not so that it will grow - but just to not lose money.
If you don't like bitcoins, no one is forcing you to use them.

Blockchain.info is generally considered the best online wallet around. You still want 2 factor and don't have more than a few coins in there.

I think the real issue here is that you want to stir up FUD so that less ASICs are sold and thus the difficulty stays lower and you win.
Do you post this kind of nonsense in Avalon threads? I bet you don't. How many delays have they had? When was batch  supposed to be shipped? How long did it take - once they said they sent them - for people to get their batch 
What about the guy who got the first one? Remember him? It was pretty much hand delivered. Why? Because they were trying to drum up business.
Bottom line is, they were late and I'll bet that you said nothing.
The fact is, this guy got his Jalapeno and is happy about it (after all, I hear all the time people spouting that not very many have posted about it, but when they do you jump on em) and you, sir, are shitting in his parade.

Bitcoins IS the study.
What you're failing to recognize is that no matter how many bitcoins are in play, it's the price that determines how many will buy a cup of coffee. If, in the future, you can buy some Starbucks for .000001 of a bitcoin, does it really matter if grandma lost her 2 BTC or Neighbor John got his wallet stolen?
No, because those were never part of the equation (not your equation, anyway).
No one really knows how many bitcoins are available to spend. They don't know now and they won't know 5 years from now.
When the price goes up, two things happen at the same time: 1) people start selling (more). 2) LESS bitcoins are actually needed as it takes more money to buy in. (for example: a month or so ago when BTC was $20, if you had $100 to invest, you could get 5. Today, you wouldn't even be able to get .5 - but you still only have the $100 - you just get less coins).
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:19:07
No, it has to do with public/private keys. Only the person with the private key can actually send money. Or else anyone could.

You make it sound an awful lot like cash.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:33:32
My bank charges exorbitant fees for keeping my cash. They charge $35 if something comes through without enough cash to cover it (even if deposits are being made at the same time), they charge to own a savings account (and WILL charge you if you try to access you money more than 6x in a month). On top of that you have ATM fees and many, many other fees that they pile on you.
Then you have the FED devaluing your cash every frickin day.
Let my give you the single biggest advantage of owning bitcoins:
***No one can touch your money if you don't give them permission.***
Can the fiat system do that? No. If I want to send money to someone in another country, I literally have to ASK permission from my bank AND pay their exorbitant fees AND wait forever and a day (and pray that it actually makes it).
If I wanted to send you cash right now, I would have to travel to your bank, deposit it into your account (so I have to have your account number) and hope the bank doesn't flag it.
As far as being used for illegal purchases/goods, you do realize that cash is the  most used exchange. I expect since you now know that (and that is your main argument) that you will immediately abandon that filthy currency (90% has traces of cocaine - 
If you do not renounce your filthy cash currency and/or change your main objection to Bitcoin to something else, then you, sir are a hypocrite.

It's 1% of the total invested amount - currently 42,700 BTC, so the max bet is 427 BTC (~$55,500) at 49.5 odds with x2 payout (standard bet).
He never bet max. He generally alternated between 100, 200, 300, 400. At one point he was massively down, bringing the site briefly to it's highest point ever. That's when I divested.

Those who pre-ordered a year ago were purchasing a product that hadn't been developed. Those who purchase now are purchasing a product that is shipping.


I just checked, the difficulty would have to be 400 million for you to only make .2 BTC / month.
Like I said, this is pure FUD. You're just pulling numbers out of your ass.
People are asking legitimate questions are you're just trying to scare them away.
Yes, it might take a few months. It could possibly take 6 months. On the other hand it could be delivered in a month. Why the fear-mongering? Is it **your** money that's being used to pay for their ASIC?

I have some hashes and although I really like the setup, ROI is pretty much not going to happen. There are many pluses compared to traditional mining, but as for a "good" investment, unless you can get your hands on a Baby Jet or something similar, you're not going to get your money back.
You can, however, point your own miners there and use it as a 0% fee pool.
As to withdrawals, the .001 fee is not automatically taken out (like it is at most places), rather you have to manually subtract that from your cashout. There is also a .1 min (that is not shown anywhere on the site), so the REAL min to cashout is .101 - plan accordingly.
If you don't have a couple grand and HAVE to have a miner, then this is your best bet as you start hashing now with no electricity costs or downtime or anything else. Throw some money at it, reinvest 25% of the payouts and invest the rest.
That's what I'm doing, at least.

Yeah, so not only is he a thief, but he's dishonest, too. Also, how many times has he said he's going to quit and never come back (including today)?
Nearly every time he plays there is some type of DDOS going on. He also owns a competing dice site.

There is more money in your Coinbase wallet than what you see. It shows your money, but it's also mixed in with others. When sending a specific amount, BTC doesn't (usually) send exact amounts. It makes change.
What you're seeing is the equivalent of telling Coinbase to give $2,000 to this address and they send $2036, with the $36 being given back as change (to a new address that they control).

In the future, large companies will probably have an off-the-blockchian system (such as Just-dice and others) where - if you frequently use a service/company you will just "pre-load" your bitcoins and spend them when you want.
This actually may be what the banks end up doing with bitcoin. You put your bitcoins in a bank and they give you a card or something that allows you to transfer the needed amount.
It may not be in the spirit of bitcoin, but the banks aren't going to stay away from this forever and businesses may want more protections than bitcoin can currently offer.

Every 4 years, the block rewards halves. Currently it sits at 25BTC (plus any fees which most pools don't pass along). It started at 50BTC. In a couple of years it will be 12.5. In about 2020 you will only be mining for dust and must rely on transaction fees to make any money (the idea being that adoption will be widespread by then).
So, essentially even with free electricity, you will keep getting closer and closer to the end zone, but never quite reach it.

It's not a scam. They're late and people are (understandably) pissed. They are shipping these jalapenos, but not the bigger units yet as they are still tweaking settings and ordering new parts (power consumption came in higher than they expected).
If you order a "J" you may receive it within 3 months. Order anything else and you may get it soon, you may not.
The donating to a charity is also not a scam. They set up their own foundation (just as Bill and Melinda Gates did) and are donating to the causes they feel are worthy (they are taking suggestions and it must be BTC related.) They just donated a bunch of BTC (75 I think) to a food for the homeless program.
Remember, when they made that 1000 BTC bet, the price of bitcoins was in the $10 range. It is now 10X the price and they are still honoring the bet. To me, that speaks volumes.
But, in the end, caveat emptor!
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:26:52
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you can bypass those fees by selecting for goods and services when sending the money. It's been awhile since I've done it and never from Germany, so it might be different now.

Asicminer makes mining equipment and mines with it (selling shares in the company and paying weekly dividends with the money it makes by mining/selling.) They also sell some (overpriced) hardware and is the only reliable method to actually get your hands on ASIC equipment at the moment. They currently own 20-25% of the entire network.
Avalon sells mining equipment (and apparently mines with it before shipping). However, they are very slow and unreliable (not to mention costly).
BFL (in case you're wondering) is also selling mining equipment, but it is considered "nextgen" as it uses a smaller, faster, less power-hungry chip. Their knock is that they took a lot of pre-orders and outsourced all the work and were surprised when things didn't go as planned. They've redesigned the chips a couple of times, missed all their target dates and missed their power consumption.
However, they are now shipping (the Jalepenos) in bulk and are quickly working through the backlog. It will take them a couple of months to catch up, but when they do they (should) be the best bang for your buck.

This is probably beyond my ability to help, but I'll try.
First, let me explain something about coinbase vs blockchain.info.
Coinbase holds everyone's BTC together in one big wallet. You may have individual addresses and can send/receive with them no problem. But technically, the BTC are not yours. They belong to Coinbase (not bashing Coinbase here).
All you own is an IOU - a point on a digital ledger. Anything can happen and Coinbase could lose your money.
Blockchain.info is different. They do not hold your coins, they show you your ledger. If they were to be hacked or go down, you could still recover your coins. You can still lose your funds if your password is too weak or if someone gets into your email account or something, but that can happen no matter where you store your coins.
Before you move any coins, it is advisable to read everything you can about bitcoins. I haven't checked recently, but there are probably some good reads on the sidebar that should get you started.
1 BTC is a lot. You probably own more BTC than 1/2 the people in Bitcoinland. You will want to do your best to secure them. The first step to securing them is to learn about them.
Good luck!
