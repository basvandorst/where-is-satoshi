People suck, unfortunately.. that's the crux of it.  (Please see: Boston)

Time to practice your swallowing skills, me thinks.

I'm sorry, but DDOS attacks are the epitome of just cheesiness.  They're not even real 'hackers'.  I, at time, long for the days of yore when someone pulling off a cheese move like a DDOS would just be laughed at in real 'hacker' circles.  (Of course, that's going back quite a while to the days of 950 codes, 900 backdoors, Compuserve brute forcing, COSMOS social engineering, etc, etc.. but what can I say, I'm like, old and stuff)

Oh I agree it sucks, its eating into our mining productivity too.

I fully agree.  Its one of the reasons I really like the idea of mining in the meantime as it at least helps mitigate losses in the short term (assume I have no electricity costs in my mining setup).  I've also taken to sourcing slightly less powerful mining hardware (buying it used) for a LOT less money so I'm able to actually put together more 'bang for the buck' then spending 3x the money for a video card pulling maybe another 100 Mhash/sec.  Fortunately I'm fairly good on the PC hardware and software side of things so that helps, too (i.e. cooling / PC build / OS / etc )

Correct, I'd be looking for a gross of at least 2% per trade, regardless of volume to help manage the fees associated.
I realize past performance is not a guarantee of future success but there have been a LOT of situations during the day in the last 2 or 3 weeks (even before the crazy rush / crash) where you could easily clear 5 - 7 % on an individual transaction.  I've seen that happen with relative frequency multiple times a day.  (Weekends excluded, of course)

Yep, VPN w/ VNC or even just GoToMyPC in a pinch would work (assuming your mining boxes are running Windows of course) - or RDP w/ a DynDNS type setup but that can be a bit more complex for the average person.
