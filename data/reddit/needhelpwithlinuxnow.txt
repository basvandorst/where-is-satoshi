Instructions should be updated to indicate tor ships with windows version.
You may have nothing to do with project, apologies if that’s so, if not and you are, this top will help windows users.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:09:32
You know what, you are absolutely right, I am a moron.
I see now, the heading is:
Step 2.1 Get Tor to your PATH on Linux.
I guess I just decided to NOT READ that heading, and went, hang on, why is there just a command for linux, I know everyone hates windows, but this blows (I say to myself).
Reality is I simply didn't read the instructions properly, my bad!

I don't know about the law in japan, but in Australia, there have been a few cases where customers fully paid for goods, then the company goes broke, into administration or liquidation, and the goods that were fully paid for are not release to the customer, but sold to the highest bidder and the customer is added to the unsecured creditors list, getting 1 cent on the dollar, if they are lucky.
I assume every one saying the same thing you are are from america, or know more about Japanese law than me, as its not the case everywhere, unfortunately.
Before anyone asks, cause I am two steps away from going to bed, Kleenmaid is the first one that comes to mind. and it happened because they sold appliances, and people bought in advance for their renovations, saying store that till I am ready, then BAM your fucked as we went broke.

thats why he is offering a 37.6 BTC reward for the hacker. Surely he lost well over 100 BTC, probably a lot more. No one pays 20k to cover a 5k loss right?
guess its over, no hack: 
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:39:12
agreed, from an AUS stance, the process is, pay secured creditors, then pay unsecured creditors.
That is after the administrators/liquidators RAPE the company for as much as they can FUCK IT OVER FOR.
The capitols are for dramatic effect, but perfectly valid, it is seriously how it happens here.

So 109.5% of the worlds gold reserves are traded annually, not double as you said.

I use igot and btcmarkets.
igot will get you BTC instantly, btcmarkets can take hours, if not more, as they have such low volume, they both work a little differently.

I put a $30k pre-order in, then did some extra research and realized it was a dangerous proposition.
They hassled me to pay up, I did not. Decided mining was not going to pay off, and with the recent increase in price I am happy enough with my decision.

You didn't get scammed, you can't read based c terms of service and withdrawal rules.
This is the dumbest post I have ever seen.
McDonald's is a scam because they say they are a fast food restaurant and I had to wait 5mins for my meal, it wasn't fast so it must be a scam!

I didn't dedicate 6 months of my life to bitcoin, the TV isn't going to watch itself bro. Sometimes I even go to work.
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:12:58
so you took to the internet to proclaim igot a scam, without actually spending any time trying to resolve the issue.
Sounds like a 5 year old after mummy says he cant have his toys until tomorrow, grow up.

the article says:
CREDITORS who owned more than 70 per cent of the bitcoins lost by Mt Gox have agreed to support efforts by a group of US investors to acquire and revive the collapsed bitcoin exchange, rather than have it liquidated by a Japanese court, according to John Betts, one of those investors.
Mr Betts is with Sunlot Holdings, an investor group that had been trying to buy Mt Gox since January last year. It is offering a token payment of one bitcoin, worth about $US500 ($534), to buy the exchange, claim sources.
An acquisition would have to be approved by a Japanese bankruptcy court. Mt Gox had been seeking a court-led rehabilitation, but faced with mounting issues, including lack of a court-approved restart plan, it gave up and said last week that Tokyo District Court had granted its request to abandon the rehabilitation efforts. It said it expected to be liquidated.
According to three people close to the matter, Sunlot, which is led by bitcoin entrepreneur Brock Pierce and includes venture capitalists Matthew Roszak and William Quigley, has agreed to buy a 12 per cent stake in Mt Gox from founder Jed McCaleb. It wasn’t clear what the price would be for that stake.
The remaining 88 per cent of the exchange is owned by chief executive Mark Karpeles.
In an April 9 letter to the bankruptcy court signed by Mr Karpeles and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the Mt Gox chief executive requested that the court approve the takeover by the consortium. The court didn’t approve the offer, finding the restart plan unrealistic, ­according to people familiar with the matter.
Tokyo-based Mt Gox collapsed in February, announcing that it had lost 850,000 bitcoins valued then at half a billion US dollars.
At a news conference then, Mr Karpeles blamed hacking attacks targeting vulnerabilities in bitcoin software. The company later said it found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins, which are now part of the exchange’s assets.
People close to the exchange said it gave up reorganisation ­efforts partly because of the difficulty of consulting with the company’s 127,000 creditors around the world.
In a last-ditch effort in its ­pursuit of the company, Sunlot last week launched a website, savegox.com, to explain its proposal and create a mechanism for Mt Gox’s creditors to express their support for it.
“Where possible they should form a block with other creditors to give them a better standing with the court and make it easier for us to communicate with them,” Mr Betts said.
Under Sunlot’s plan, those creditors would receive payouts from the 200,000 bitcoins that were recovered in March and an equity stake in the exchange. It also promised due diligence would be conducted by one of the big four auditing firms.
“This is about bitcoin and ­preserving the value of the bitcoin ecosystem,” said Mr Betts, who built electronic trading platforms at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in New York. “This is our collective opportunity to demonstrate the commitment of (the bitcoin) community, that we don’t need government bailouts and that the community is self-healing.”
The Tokyo court and Nobuaki Kobayashi, then a court-­appointed supervisor, saw Sunlot’s proposal as unrealistic because it lacked enough financial backing. Mr Betts said the group has prepared a statement of financial commitment to the court. Sunlot argues that questions surrounding the remaining 650,000 coins leave an “information vacuum” that precludes anyone from properly valuing Mt Gox.
Several people close to Mt Gox said it was unlikely that more bitcoins would be discovered. The exchange’s in-house investigation found in addition to the vulnerabilities previously cited by the company, hackers manipulated their account balances, possibly with inside knowledge of the exchange’s system, ­according to sources.

Ok so I just did a test transaction to see how it all works.
I had to pay a transaction fee of 0.0001 BTC, which was fine.
created an account and swept the contents into the blockchain account, where it now has only the original ammount I transferred, minus another 0.0001 BTC, I assume as there was a fee to sweep it into the account as well right?
@_date: 2014-10-29 09:56:20
No problem, just a literal statement, still true, will let you know if that changes

and what a surprise, OP now realizes he hasn't been scammed, because it was NEVER A FUCKING SCAM.
Dumbass posts like this make people believe that a website/service is not to be trusted, its creating a negative slant on a website/service without any merit whatsoever.
If he had attempted to resolve his issue before running to reddit and proclaiming that igot was a scam, this thread would not exist.

@_date: 2014-05-08 09:18:24
If you are after speed, then going to the bank is probably your best option,  I did this once, but if your trying to buy $1000 or more its not really viable, however I am happy enough to wait 24 hours.
Also, trading can be as low as 0.5% on btcmarkets.net if you refer a friend or something.
No I don't work for them, but I like low fees!!
@_date: 2014-05-08 05:18:00
at 2% for buying and 1.1% for selling, not that long I guess.
I use btcmarkets.net as they have lower fees. (1% buy/sell, lower for business/traders etc)
BPAY is fine for paying bills, but I don't need it for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:20:28
completely agree, low volume IS an issue, but I am sure it will get better.
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:22:16
I used them, verified no problem, bought 18BTC the other day when it was at its low, deposited cash and withdrew the BTC no probs at all.
The company is Australia, as am I, but verification was the simplest I have ever tried.
Also I found their support to be good.
(see previous history about someone else saying its a scam, fast forward and their issue was resolved very quickly. Obviously no the case here, dunno)
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:24:17
Igot 18BTC last week from them, withdrew no problems within 8 hours (ish)
Must be more to it?

just because you wouldn't abide by their rules does not make them a scam.
I ahve heard this argument multiple times on here about igot, noone seems to like their rules but it is what it is.
I have used igot numrous times (not for about a year though) and I never had ANY problems.
They are not a scam.

Mabye, but not in this case.
I highly doubt its not documented that you have to do this, but i havent checked

Shut up mum, you can't control me on the internet
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:41:49
Clearly you are a moron, as the business is not a scam, if you don't agree with their rules then contact them, others have used their service without issues.
A scam is where they defraud you and take your money, this is not that.
You don't like their policies, that my friend is a different word.
