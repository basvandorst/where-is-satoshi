I do believe I will be taking a few mBTC and converting them into Reddit gold in celebration.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:03:40
That's only one side of it, though. I went to one of his rallies and some guy was taking a public opinion poll on the gold standard and I explained to him why I thought it was a terrible idea. I swear the crowd around me all stopped in their tracks to convert me to their point of view... Even though I clearly supported him, having had a volunteer pass and a Ron Paul shirt on.
tl;dr - It's completely possible to support a politician and not agree with *all* of their ideals.

He's saying if you don't understand something, then don't try to control it. Let the people that DO understand it handle the situation.

How dare you find a middle ground when voicing your opinions on Ron Paul! You must worship him or hate him with all that you are worth!
Seriously though, why is everyone so black and white when it comes to Ron Paul? I worked with his campaign during the last election, and agree with a good chunk of what he stands for, but holy hell is it annoying trying to have a conversation with anyone that feels strongly one way or the other about him...

[Per request.](
I pretty much agree. The more established exchanges should work together to make a general guideline on how to manage / secure their assets in order to help establish a higher degree of stability.

No, just Pluto huge.

Nah, they were just lost.

Thanks, it still hasn't gone through at all. I'll send an email.
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:35:23
I'm not familiar with it, but I'm not about to just let $2,000 blow away in the wind if I can help it. Thanks, I hope this helps.
Edit: I looked it up, and the .01 btc is showing up there but not the 2.9. MultiBit is showing that I did send the 2.9 to that same address still, though it says the status is not yet confirmed and has been seen by 1 peer.

Could one say that it might make it all the way to the nearest celestial body?

Between the two transfers? Maybe 10 seconds after the first one popped up as pending on coinbase. Like 2 minutes total. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:56:36
No, and the first transfer only took about a minute to show up. It's been over an hour since then.  
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:59:02
Good idea. If I manage to get it back, you're getting guilded.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:21:56
Great, let it jump up to $1,200 over the next week and then watch as it crashes back down to $800 and doesn't make the news again for another 3 years!
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:00:59
Sent it to the same coinbase wallet that my initial small transfer went to.
@_date: 2016-12-15 22:58:44
It doesn't show the 2.9 leaving on block explorer, but does still show the initial .01. Is it safe to assume that the 2.9 will show back up in my MultiBit wallet at some point, since nowhere is showing it leaving in the first place (aside from my MultiBit showing that I got rid of it)?
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:41:50
So it just sent the 2nd transaction into space essentially, or will it notice that it's no longer a wallet address and come back to me? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:22
I need a break! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:27:07
I think it was so owner's don't run their battery to empty, which can damage it, and so they can have a "limp" mode if their battery gets too low.

That's Facebook for you. Throw in the run-of-the-mill conspiracy theorists that unfortunately gravitate to Ron Paul, and you get comments that can erase IQ points in a hurry.

I bought 3.34 BTC on the same day for $888 each... Hopefully they do the same for me.

I understand what he was trying to say; I was just providing a not-so-great joke response.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:49:39
Looks like it should work, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:04:52
If you (or anyone else) happens to find a stream to either interview I would greatly appreciate it if you were to share it here :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:20:44
Thanks for explaining the difference instead of blasting me for not realizing it (unlike everyone else here).

Why can't someone be pro cancer? I despise the human species and am for anything that wipes us out by the millions.

Does coinbase cost anything to use? I would imagine they take a percentage of each transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:32:50
Just saw a transaction of over 1000 btc in Germany... That's a lot of dough.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:29:22
Went all in at 888... fuck me, right?
