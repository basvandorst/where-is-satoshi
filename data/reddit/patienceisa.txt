Well you can do a lot more on them than on Dogecoin, which is literally just a clone of Litecoin...? Also, Ethereum will be mineable through Dagger Hashimoto for its first iteration, then switch to PoS in an update once they've solved it. That's what Vitalik has said anyway.

Dam, Vitalik sure knows his game theory. Looooong read but I guess what he says makes sense. I think there will be room for everyone at the end of the day. 
The more blockchains working together the better!

No solution proposed yet from what i've seen :( otherwise they would be opening with with PoS in March. Makes things interesting - if they are going with PoS eventually, then it makes sense to hold any ether mined in PoW for when it does switch to PoS because it will be worth more. I could be wrong, but this may make the price rise significantly unless people need to liquidate assets immediately.
Nothing at stake is an interesting problem (wish it was solved so we could focus on more important things like "nothing but steaks", am I right guys?).
As far as I'm aware, all of the current examples of proof of stake are broken because of this issue. Also they are secretly [very centralised and controlled by the devs](
I few people I've spoken too though say the problem is solvable, it's just a case of when that it is done. 
Time will tell.

Just like any alt then?

I'm quite new to reddit, but this tipping business is awesome!

You can, just hop on the ethereum PoC 7 testnet.

Ethereum is so interface-able though (sorry that might not be a word), it pretty much will just be a sidechain to Bitcoin. 
I've been looking a lot into all of this recently. I see a future were there are thousands or millions of blockchains all optimised for certain activities, then you have Bitcoin working as the money and Ethereum working as the glue holding it all together.
As I said, BTC can really easily be represented (with its true value) on top of ethereum, so you will be able to use BTC for all of Ethereum's gas operations. Ether will just be used to translate it.

Is Bitcoin really that [secure](
I'd argue not so much.

Arstechnica needs to do more Bitcoin coverage. They only care when something is stolen!

If Counterparty is able to recreate Ethereum, then the crowdsale is justified in that there is a product which is enrich crypto technologies at large. 
Ethereum is not just about "Ethereum" - it's about bringing technology forward in general.

Woo this is great!

Cool to see IBM is using Ethereum, Bittorent and Telehash for their IoT project Adept -

Who's to say it isn't you trying to damage Ethereum's reputation?
It a very stupid tactic that only pisses people off and obviously wont affect the price. The only reason you would do it is to make Ethereum look bad...
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:14:01
But why? Obviously not them... If anything the spam is negative for the price of ether as it is annoying.

Ah jeez there goes my side pot.

Did anyone hear about the USA police who actually paid the ransom?
