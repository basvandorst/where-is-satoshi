He sounds bullish to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:23
He did answer the question. Miners will get into futures to hedge. If they lose 10% to futures, it’s not too disastrous because they are up 90% in their btc. This will keep them mining btc and not go off to forks and altcoins that does not have futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:25
You are betting that Bitcoin will be below a certain price. If it’s not, you lose money. If it is below that price, you make money.

Dollar cost average. There is no guarantee something will go down. If you sell now and there is no dip, you’re out of luck. If you don’t sell and there is a dip, you can lower your average by buying at a lower cost. When it does go back up, you make money without the price having to go back to your initial investment.

Not how it works. If you take out an option on btc but there’s an expiration date. Lets say it’s one year. If the price is not 1000mil next year, you lose your money. And yes, a contract is between a buyer and seller, in this case it’s CME  who is selling the contracts.

This is easier done with stocks. There are many more shares of stocks than there are btc. Companies can do offerings and create for shares. Btc is limited. If it gets shorted, people are just gonna buy up the limited btc at a lower price and hold. This will drive demand back up while supply is low.

That’s not true and you are spreading FUD. Exchanges have gone a long way since Mt. Gox. The Japanese exchange that was recently hacked have begun paying back customers. I understand not everyone will be paid back and not fully but it’s not like what it use to be. Exchanges have a long way to go and it may be years or decades but they continue to improve. Coinbase is working with regulators as we speak in regards to being fully insured. As of now, the cash you have with Coinbase is insured.

I get we want decentralization but Banks getting involved is how we get the price of BTC to 6 figures. The majority of people out there are more willing to trust a bank and a “savings” account when it comes to investing. I imagine it being much like Coinbase, there they keep the actual coins and keys. It’s better to hold your own coins and keys but have no doubt dear hodlers. This is good news.

Banks and wallstreet will make this current spike look like nothing. Also remember, these are not stocks. If they short it and lower the price, that’s an invitation for bulls to buy cheap and hold.

You don’t see adds for BTC ETH or LTC. Most of these scams are pumping shitcoins and icos. The scammers take the money and put it into a more stable coin or currency. So in a way, it’s good for BTC.

What is Nike’s ATH?

I love all the people losing money on shitcoins. It just means the money is being taken out of their hands and put somewhere else, like btc and ltc. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:06:04
But for how long?
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:24:37
If anyone can prove otherwise, I have no reason not to.

I’m so confused. What’s stopping me from buying from some stranger in another country and transfer it directly to my ledger? Where does Coinbase come into play? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:54:15
Shhhh. They don’t want the word out so they can accumulate low.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:36:03
So these guys own BTC, says it will go up and people are criticizing them for it. 
Charlie Lee sells his LTC, says it will go up and people criticizing him for not owning LTC and not believing in it. 
Can’t win.

Do you have proof of that? ATH is plus $400. His average price was half if that.

It’s a great app for people who just want to invest in some btc and have no other understanding of it. Most of my crypto are on an nano s but I have a very small amount on RH just for fun swing trading. No fees and it’s so simple and quick. It doesn’t hurt BTC and only helps.

Btc at $1m or he will eat his dick. Forgot what the timeframe was but something like 2019 or 2020?

ATH is more than double today’s price. If you believe in btc long term, $8k is a steal.

It’s just Robinhood or Coinbase.

The people sitting down by the first guy is thinking he’s crazy and why did crazy guy have to dance next to them. At the end, the people dancing are looking at those people still sitting and asking them to get up and move somewhere else so they can dance. Now they look crazy for wanting to remain sitting in the middle of a dance crowd.

He’s always said LTC is silver to BTC’s gold. This is nothing new and it doesn’t mean silver is worthless because it’s not gold. BTC has benefited from the existence of LTC. People need to do more research if they actually believe in BTC while calling LTC a shitcoin.

In Vietnam our apples are generally not red. We mainly have star apples and crab apples which are eaten green and turn a bright purple when ripe. The red apples are usually imported from China and are not very popular.

Most of the time these purchases and sales happen, we come to find out few weeks later that it was just a cold storage move from a major exchange.

Just like the guy on here that bet btc would not go below $5k. Dude disappeared the same day it dropped. You’re not doing it and no one gives a shit what you promise on the internet.

You’re thinking of Monero. Anyone can see transactions in the bitcoin blockchain.
