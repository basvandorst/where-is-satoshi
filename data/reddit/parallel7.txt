Bitcoin Core is not absolutely anonymous. If you receive some coins, your client will broadcast that transaction every hour until it confirms unless configured to not do it.

We should be even because I expect my private data would be sold or stolen after few years. Real bitcoins sitting at random utxos could not be faked.

If you own fully synced node, you could use [watch-only address feature]( Do importaddress RPC call on your full node, then you should do a reindex that takes an while.

I bet it is easier to avoid taxes without using Bitcoin. Bitcoin could be used as an alternative to a bank to hold savings or avoid money loss if bank goes mad. Someone might speculate euro will go down. Bitcoin giveaway in Ukraine had done Bitcoin promotion job.

If she does not knows what kind of tool Bitcoin is you should not do it. You should leave her country issued tools known as her savings alone if she does not understand what is at stake.

That tool collects 0.0001 and less BTC outputs and signs them with NONE|ANYONECANPAY, then sends them delivers them dust-b-gone.bitcoin.petertodd.org:80. If average input takes 148 bytes then it would send 68 sat/byte inputs to petertodd. I will consider creating transaction with one OP_RETURN zero satoshi output instead.

If you want to obfuscate your bitcoin movement traces you could give a coinmarket a try. But do not try to render your bitcoin useless!

Best alternative would be decreasing privacy requirements. Banks already know you like cash.

So there should be hash of old small block and hash of new big block. Where these hashes would appear in a series of old small and new big block pairs?
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:56:50
That is their business to crawl out all your private data you would not give otherwise.

Have you seen this map?  Estonia has two regulated ATMs, Latvia has nothing, Lithuania has a bunch of other Bitcoin services. Time to travel to south!

[[[It was tested on Win 7 x64 with HDD and it performs better than setting dbcache according to RAM. *horribly slow* part might be true for Linux OSes, I dunno, not for Windows. 
It is a killswitch for 32 bit OSes, just to make sure. 
I think bitcoin-qt client is suicide mission for SSDs, HDD should do that job good enough for years without burnout issues since sync speed is capped at CPU speed for last year.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:30:26
Yep, blowing up outdated 32 bit clients would not be nice move, I agree. I'll remove mempool part from *restarted my node, mempool is still 299.99 MB used and nobody mined a new block at that time* dream.

Similar problems. I have not tried any exchanges so far, maybe LocalBitcoins will fit your needs? If there are not cheating sellers I would buy some too.

Do not fall in bitcoin multiply traps. You can ~~hold~~ **HODL** your bitcoin and and look at them after year or more.

As long as all data (including witness data) is secured by PoW proof (for example witness data is additionally hashed along with previous block hash *Edit:* or merkle root and resulting data is mined with next block) there should not be a reason to oppose SegWit. Including only merkle root in witness data looks like self signed certificate without signed authority. It does not looks PoW secured. **Lets mine everything! If it is too hard, then at least a hash of it!**

They try to enforce AML/KYC thing on your bitcoins. If you have no private keys, you have no bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-05-09 21:56:42
If it is not an hdd corruption issue then it is os issue. My guess some other program on your system took an exclusive access of your bitcoin-qt database files. You might give a try to sync up without your wallet and then rename it back. 
PS. Portable PC might be a better option if you are facing with frequent power outages.

Do not forget to open control port on tor if you want incoming tor connections. Explicit setting for incoming tor address may not be required.

There are more scams around than legit websites. Maybe your plugin should display positive message about legit website and warn about anything else. Trying to stop scam is like trying to stop computer viruses - you would know about it after harm is done.
