I don't think that is true. If some one comes up to me and says, "Hey, do you want to buy this stolen stereo?", am I legally required to report him?

MtGox is being blamed because they run a shitty service and have for years. This is just the latest of their massive fuckups.
No one should use MtGox for anything ever again except as an example of how to not to run a company.

Can you give any more details of the interview and their environment?
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:44:20
Not really.
Fuck MtGox!

Don't tell me "Its ogre" .
It's not ogre until the large, hideous, manlike monster that eats human beings sings.

Just because others have stopped doesn't mean they are in the same trouble as MtGox. 
MtGox could be insolvent now. They were sending out transactions that had their txids modified but that still completed. Then people would contact MtGox support claim that they never received their bitcoins and support looked for the txid on the blockchain couldn't find it and would then either credit their account on MtGox or send out a new transaction using different inputs. This is bad and had been going on for awhile (it looks like for 2 weeks at least). If they were running a competent service, they should have detected and traced the problem the first day. They should be balancing their books every day. Now they are in a lot of trouble.

Well, whoever generated that PGP key is either a PGP noob or an idiot.
Their PGP key was most likely generated by the [igolder]( PGP client. igolder could be collecting all keys, pass phrases, and cleartext messages. You can also reach the site without using HTTP**S**, which exposes all of your data to anyone listening on the link. Since many people that used Silk Road used this site to encrypt their messages, it would be no problem for the FBI to get a warrant, like they did for Lavabit, to get all of the unencrypted data.

That would be true on a regulated exchange. Is MtGox a regulated exchange in Japan?
