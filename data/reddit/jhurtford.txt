- First value for bitcoin comes in large part by people deciding it is a better money than fiat; i.e. decentralized creation and perfect scarcity. Historically the dollar buys less and less bitcoin (last 10 years) Money is a grand illusion and more people are picking this illusion of sound money. Since bitcoin is unlikely to die and offers a choice to fiat, people will continue to move into it... hard&gt;soft money 
Added benefits,
-No one can censure transactions (control)
-Be your own bank (control)
-Lightening network will solve the scalablity issues you talked about 
-Programmable money 
-Permission-less access

Is this the "then they fight you" stage?
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:36:50
subpar 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:14:59
They aren't holding the BTC though? basically selling to fiat? do i have to pay capital gains for coffee?

So my worthless personal opinion is, inflation doesn't actually encourage spending, people spend because they need too, consumption is a necessity of life, so while right now no-one is going to spend their bitcoin because we all think wow bitcoin to the moon! but as we approach the moon the amount of reward available for holding will decrease and we will be more and more inclined to spend, currently i hope over the next year my bitcoin appreciates 100%, in 2020/moon i'll only expect it to appreciate 1-5%

Lol they are missing out! 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:16:15
But they aren't actually accepting BTC? Just you can sell your btc for fiat and pay for the coffee? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:31:47
It's the people money! but a handful control most the bitcoin

So if Ethereum solves its scalability issues and institutes POS, would it be a better return to hold "digital gold" or to stake?

Nobody has ever said better buy this today before the price goes up right? Yes but not at 2%
What 2% inflation does do:
Sets incentive you must find yield &gt;2% to preserve wealth/time
1) Most spending has to do with time preference and necessity. Slight inflation or deflation is too irrational/negligible a thought to curb human consumption any direction 
2) Volatility decreases with price increase, it has, it's hardly moved since november lol and over the course of 10 years it's value has increased, a store of value is something you hold for a long time so bitcoin should be looked at it for it's life, "it's not about how many times you fall, its about how many do you get up again" &gt;)  
Besides bitcoin eventually becomes a flat line, neither inflation nor deflation occurs, unsure if and how it will replace fiat, it may still fail, money is just belief right

Did you know that 82% of statistics are made up on the spot?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:53:14
sure hope so haha
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:59:56
So the belief part isn't all bad right? if people believe bitcoin has value they feel safe, rightly or wrongly, to ya know store there value there, this coupled with hopefully a deflationary nature or in short term, slow consistent growth, This sov entices new entrants to also buy and hold, the hold floor is essentially the believe floor and belief in value is all you really need as long it can operate as a currency 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:00:54
A point to make on that is, if Arizona "accepts bitcoin" they immediately change it over to USD, much like when we spend on cards linked to our cryptoaccounts at the point of transfer it is still USD, unfortunately we are not yet at a point where they actually keep the crypto 
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:50:23
It is speculative for sure, mostly speculative, but I do feel that many people hold on to it and this holding the line at like 10k for example means that it can work as a store of value which will encourage adoption 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:17:53
wow people are willing to pay almost 20k for one of these?? must be a big joke

Better know our weakness, the better we can defend against, better to be mobilized then ignorant, thanks for the post 
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:49:08
You can't snort things thru a bitcoin though
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:57:04
thank you hahaha

General audience and people who are thinking about investing, I guess the one takeaway I would to get across is that Bitcoin is a reality and isn't just misunderstood sketchy internet money but a legitimate alternative
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:56:14
I thought the Pro-side did a pretty poor job honestly 
@_date: 2018-04-23 09:27:35
its not necessarily bad, kinda lowers the price for everyone of us to buy more and now atleast this person is aware of bitcoin, use it just to buy a coffee so you dont have to spend much and they are the ones that end up losing in the end
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:48:57
Still unsure why they wouldn't just change from 1mb to 2mb?
