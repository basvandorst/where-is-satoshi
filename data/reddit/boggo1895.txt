I’m not sure what country your from but house prices have not been falling tremendously in the uk.
But let’s say there is a hyper deflation situation, how do you avoid losing your entire investment relatively?
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:25:36
Right sorry, I get you. thought you was playing off the current housing market as hyper deflationary

The feeling of owning 1 bitcoin would keep me awake at night hoping it rises in value and praying it dosnt’ drop 
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:13:30
Might have to give it a read

By the same token as logic a ring also has no inherent value as it requires the double coincidence of wants to make a sale since you can’t really do anything with it and consequently gold would not be valued since the value of gold is inflated due to its derived demand. 
Same goes for fiat money, it is only a means of exchange that only holds up because it is accepted in return for goods and services. As more and more places accept bitcoin you never know where the value of bitcoin will go

Erm I don’t think they can, I don’t have a source but as far as I’m aware it’s common law amongst most countries that a seller can accept payment in whatever form they want. If you want to sell something for 3 goats you can do so long as it’s not your children. Fiat currency would be worthless without the knowledge that it’s will be accepted everywhere. It was invented as a means of exchange, the same way bitcoin has been.

Not going to lie I had to google who he was, I’m not that deep into bitcoin and still learning but I just applied basic economics

Still very new, hoping to buy some more so I’ve just set up a software wallet so I can move my satoshis away from coinbase. Where can I buy from to avoid coinbase fees?
@_date: 2019-11-25 09:36:33
 Because nobody wants to hear that (myself included)

Just done it, they are reduced to £10 when you sign up now so not as good as an offer but still not bad

Where is the best place for a noob to buy a cheap hard wallet for storing a very small amount of btc
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:28:15
It’s the Russians buying the worlds supply of bitcoin, not to try and shut it down but for profitable gain, it will reduce people willingness and ability to supply reducing the quantity on the market for Q1 to Q2 and there fore increasing price from P1 to P2 this enables them to further there nuclear arms program and take 1 step closer towards a new world order

Coinbase or coin base pro, I won’t have access to my laptop for the next 2hrs but I’ll be straight on to do it when I get home
Also I’ve read to not store my coins with coinbase so how would I set up my own wallet

Hello, I’m finally ready to take the leap and invest the small amount I can afford into crypto. 
Which sites are safe to use and how do I do it
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:46:07
I suggested it to him years ago, he has just out of the blue come round to the idea but has no idea how and expects me to tech him because I have an interest myself.
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:12:49

Can you explain to me what you mean by a HD please and why this is beneficial 
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:57:10
Ah ok thank you very much 
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:55:19
I understand what bitcoin is, I have a friend who to has just sold all his a couple months back (sorry if that upsets anyone here) unfortunately I don’t have the computer knowledge or money so set up a platform capable of housing it 
@_date: 2018-07-29 12:50:08
Thanks for the help, what is the relevance of the 12 words or will that become clear when he sets it up?
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:02:24
In 1999 there was (I say) mass panic because people where worried about how computers would cope switching over to 2000 since they had never even switched between a century before. Computer analyst worried that they would crash and online systems would be down for days if not weeks. 
Spoiler alert: nothing happened.
