$570 + $15 premium = $585
$585 + 2.5% convenience fee = $599.63
$599.63 + $10 fuck you fee = $609.63 per 1 bitcoin
$609.63 - $570 = $39.63 premium over market price. 
Bitcoin.com is a fucking ripoff.

People DO try to claim that. It was the whole purpose of the spam attack. 


is showing you direct evidence that a block size increase is not necessary, and you're saying that evidence is irrelevant because 'we need bigger blocks'.

I love how she asked if he could point out a 'bright spot' in everything that's happening, and he just chuckles and reiterates how fucked everything has become over the past 30 years.

Hmm, maybe we should ask law enforcement for their permission first? Maybe we should ask them for a law that requires us to register all our bitcoin addresses under our real names? Or how about making it so that only government-issued bitcoin addresses are permissible. That way they could force us to register before using the block chain, and they could apply taxes and negative interest rates very conveniently. We should really do whatever it takes to make their jobs easier. We must appease our masters.
Oh, wait. I don't give a fuck.

If I give you $100, I can't tell what you do with it. Once it's in your possession, I have no way of tracking it. 
Not true with Bitcoin. I can send you a bitcoin and then watch your address and wait for you to spend it, and possibly even determine if you used it for gambling or something I deem unethical. I can even trace what the person you sent it to does with it!
Confidential Transactions will improve the fungibility of Bitcoin by providing a means to make transactions more private for users. Highly fungible money is more valuable and more widely accepted.

That's more indicative of miner centralization than anything.

CSV added a new OP_CODE. It did not restructure the transaction format or add a new merkle tree. Segwit is more complicated than CSV.

Good thing Visa gave you permission to spend your money. Oh wait, maybe it wasn't even your money. Please tell me you didn't use a credit card to take out a loan from your existing bank, thereby allowing them to create money from thin air to loan and collect interest from it until you pay them back.

How is that supposed to work if banks refuse to allow transfers to bitcoin exchanges? Some people might trade for cash on local markets, but we already know governments are itching to ban cash. With severe capital controls it will be impossible for people to move the vast majority of their wealth into bitcoin.
