I'm a radical leftist, not a radical consumer. The plan is to organize the industries of the world, hold a general strike, and tell the grafters to get a real job. I like bitcoin, think it's interesting and innovative, but i'm not here to defend it. I simply cannot stand by while you snark all over the place and circlejerk on r/buttcoin . leave them alone. if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

OH. No, not them. I just really hate hierarchy, and you're here jerking off to hierarchy like it's the last chance you'll get. I know that it's popular to pigeonhole cryptocurrency enthusiasts as right wing nutjobs, but try using some critical thinking skills.
In passing, you do seem tangentially interested in the revolutionary concepts i'm espousing. If you have further interest, you can learn more at

Agism. You're not wiser because you are older. Check your privilege.


Maybe you could ask what the OP's mentality is, rather than assuming, with the goal of belittling.






“Fuck you. I got mine.”


The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people, and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take posession of the means of production, aboish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth.


It seems you are asking this rhetorically, but you don't score points with me for rhetorical style, only substance. So I'll answer you substantially: the system is fucked, and it will poison us (literally) in only a few years. It may actually already be unsalvageable, but if I believed that, I wouldn't be here trying to make you see reason. Please join the struggle.


"Silly" is dysphemistic and doesn't contribute to the following.








I WAS RIGHT. “Fuck you. I got mine.”


No. It's clear to me that you support the state AND capital. Prepare to be eaten. It's our world, not yours.
