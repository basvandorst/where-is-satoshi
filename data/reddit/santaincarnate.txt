That's a massive simplification. 
Like most pre-decimal systems it used different bases for different subdivisions;
* 4 farthings to a penny
* 12 pence to shilling
* 20 shillings to a pound
Not quite as horrific as distance measures;
* 1000 thou to an inch
* 12 inches to a foot
* 3 feet to a yard
* 22 yards to a chain
* 10 chains to a furlong
* 8 furlongs to a mile

Estimating the total number of rules probably isn't that hard.
* Choose a character by value (4) and position (2) in word/key (1) 
* Pick (insert/replace/delete)/(move/swap)
* Insert/Replace is worth 5.7-8 
* Move/Swap is worth about 3.5
Absolute total number of rules is about 13 bits if you only substitute in lowalpha, 15 bits for all keyboard characters, *BUT* almost all of this is coming from rules where you're replacing one character for another. The others don't offer enough choices. I reckon 10 bits per rule is optimistic if they're picked by a human.
I suppose my real problem with the proposed scheme is that it's rather complex, but offers no more security than just picking a phrase and then appending a few random characters.

These don't add much entropy. 


About 3 bits


About 8 bits


One ibt


About 7 bits


About 8 bits
So if you mixed ALL of those you'd get a 27 bit password. That's on top of the entropy from the phrase, in this case zero bits.
27 bits is a password such as:
* fjsmp
* k$8\
If you can test a million a second, you can crack it in about a minute.

@_date: 2014-01-27 00:28:31
Not really. 
In the pick step, you can pick by value. Choices here are; ignore; space, the 13 lowalpha characters in the phrase, vowels. That's 16, or 4bits of entropy. You can probably think of a few other sets (consonants, first half of alphabet, LHS keyboard) but it would have to be very contrived to raise the entropy for the step above 5 bits.
Position has possible values of (ignore, zero, one, two). It can't really be much higher, as otherwise it won't catch anything.
I'm pretty confident someone will get this and probably quickly. I'll give it a go myself if they haven't in the next couple of days.

Assuming that all the matches are coinflips is a very bad approximation. The odds on the shortest straight forecast for each group is about 2:1 to 4:1 - not 11:1. Therefore the odds on guessing the group results is about 7,000:1 rather than 430,000,000:1
Harder to estimate the odds for the knockout stage, but it will be much shorter than evens.
