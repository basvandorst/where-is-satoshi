That's solid \*\*advice\*\*.  But doesn't need to be, and shouldn't be, legislated into board law.  People can make their own decisions.  We don't need a helicopter parent.

A mediocre to poor hedge, I think. 
For most, Bitcoin is an investment or speculation. So, at root it’s a place people put money they are willing to risk.
Bitcoin is therefore much more *like* the stock market than an alternative to it.
People wish to reduce risk in the event if a stock market decline/crash. So, money seems more  likely to leave risky spots - i.e. both stocks and crypto - and move somewhere safer, than to go from one risky spot, stocks, to another, crypto.

There is a view of BTC that it is a store of value, not a currency for everyday use.  Under that view, one holds BTC like it's gold.  
Given BTC's slow transaction times, with no solution on the horizon that's adequate to enable BTC to be used as an everyday currency, the 'store of value' view may be the better approach.

The grand success of just a few alts could achieve the same result as another all-alt mania.

Super.  Glad I took the time.

There is surprisingly little discussion of this price rise possibly being a “Buy the rumor, sell the news” response to the upcoming Facebook coin event on June 18th.   
What am I missing?

I've been hearing about Rootstock for so long.  Next week is the big day? That's great. 
Edit:  ooooohhhh. It's weird pegging process replaces an actual independent token.  Interesting.

I think it is indeed known to be coming. But the idea usually still applies, maybe better termed “Buy the lead-up, sell the news.”

Well I am a lawyer.  And I think you're quite right.

So you can pay for shit with Bitcoin.  
Bad pun; I’m just taking the piss.

Username checks out. Because a Soviet’s understanding of econ is the only explanation for your viewpoint.   
I mean, he just explained the concept to you. Simply swap in $700 and xyz other new numbers rather than the $4K and 10K in his current example.

Bitcoin is the granddaddy of “cryptocurrencies”. But it is only one of many. Various coins offer a variety of different features and specializations.  The whole industry is commonly called “crypto”.

That would make it difficult for banks to lend.  The economy would find its wheels stuck in a tar pit. To promote growth banks must lend as much as possible. So the reserve should be adequate to prevent irresponsible lending, but no more.

Wow, that’s awesome dude. Congrats!!    
(And yes, that’s what she said.)

Ha the vast majority, yes.  But since "crypto" includes all coins, it includes the legitimate altcoins like Ethereum, IOTA, maybe NEO, StellarLumens, etc.  But by percentage, yeah +90% shitcoins.

That’s good. You’ve taken your first step into a larger world.
