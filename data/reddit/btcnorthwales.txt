Is it 2 days or 4 days? If you've not covered the miners fees there's no limit on the amount of time it can take. 
How much did you send?
1. These won't get dropped, they will sit in limbo until a minder processes them. 
2. no. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:02:17
You're right, my bad. Hard to keep track when it's shooting up so god dammm fast.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:51:04
I asked myself the same question when it was $8000, glad I just bit the bullet and got it. Up 4k in 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:49:21
I wouldn't buy into BTC at that point if I were you. We're about 12 months away from that and 1 BTC would be about 50k by that point. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:51:55
Ha what a bag of steaming shit 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:50:50
Corey407. BTC will dip in about 24 to 32 hours. Wait before you buy. You'll get it about $1000 cheaper. Feel free to quote me on that. it will quickly go back up

Buy now, profit tomorrow, retire next year 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:26:34
10, it will be 14k before Christmas. Buy today, profit tomorrow, retire next year.

Hey dude, 
When buying on coinbase you will have fee's, these can't be avoided but from this point trading between £ and Bitcoin can be done without fees. Open GDAX and using the Limit Buy/sell and you won't be charged a taker/maker fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:07:47
note - it's back upto £10,859.13 but that's still less than £11,000 so it's still popped. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:01:10
Buy now, profit by tomorrow, retire next year

The Crypro Market is worth $300 billion, with Bitcoin taking the largest chunk of that so it's not going to Crash. Bitcoin like all other Crypro's is highly volitile fluctuating at around $1000 per day. It may well dip occasionally, but this is a dip not a crash. Looking at bitcoins future, the backing it has from large wealthy investors it's most likely going to be at around $15,000 by December 11th with a large jump 3/4 days before with the planned improvements. 
Anyone who says otherwise is normally talking out of their arse because they are sad they never invested when it was cheaper. Put it this way, if you invested 30 days ago, you would have made 20% profit already, it's never too late.

Once you have a purpose built building, placed in a cold country where electricity is free. Bespoke design to stop any type of dust entering the building. Fill it with $500,000 of mining equipment running at 80% 24/7, you'll turn a profit after 2 years providing bitcoin continues to grow.

Sorry to be a pain. I'm pretty new to all this, could you expand on "Control your private Keys"?.
All I've done is paid for some BTC and thrown it on my TREZOR

160 = 0.014624 Bitcoin . If an offer seems too good to be true it normally is. 
I have written a guide to getting started on Bitcoin if you would like me to share it with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:31:54
You're not going to mine 1btc in 1 year with $10,000 of mining equipment. Also, 10,000 of mining equipment will burn out in 6 months because it's maxed, even over clocked 20/7. 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:05:21
Sure! happy to help where I can, we've all been there. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:58:10
Yup. HODL for 12 months, 24 if you can and then Party!!! and be thankful you didn't listen to the morons

Hey dude,
Coinbase is an exchange but it's not very good in comparison to others. 
If you're just storing and you have no desire to trade it, I would recommend moving it into a wallet. If you want to trade it I'd move it too Poloneix. 
Coinbase also have fees when transferring credit but they is a very easy way to negate the coinbase withdrawal fees . If you google it, there's some really helpful youtube videos which will help you with that. it can you a little on each transaction. 
PM me if you do plan on creating a coinbase account and I'll send you a referral code. We both get $10 when you deposit $100 that way.

Hi does is this offer extended to anyone? I can pay 15 ripple 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:20:54
Nope, infact I think we will see it past 11k by Dec 1st. Feel free to quote me on that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:48
13K before Dec01. Just wait..
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:17:50
Nope, I don't think so 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:25:41
Forget mining but if you really want to mine, just download Nicehash. 
Use coinbase if you want to buy bitcoin. Let me know if you want a referral code
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:18:19
Hey dude, 
I was lucky enough to have a mentor. I personally have bitcoin stored on a Trezor Wallet and I have other bits on  exchange. 
If you want to buy £3000+ I would recommend a wallet. safer and secure. If you just want to play about with smaller amounts an exchange is fine. 
Easiest way to start (in my opinion) is on Coinbase then transfer your crypro onto an exchange like poloneix or your wallet.

The price is determined by the need for BTC. So if everyone started selling it and everyone decided not to buy it the price would go down to reflect the market. 
It would drop quickly if a big investor sold everything but until all big investors sold everything the value should remain pretty stable. 
Alternatively if quantum computering was mastered, we could mine most cryptos effortlessly and their value would be void. but we're no where near that. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:53
All the hype being created is doing nothing but fuel the awareness of bitcoin causing a whole new influx of small and large investors. The real investors of bitcoin, people who own billions of $ of bitcoin are the ones who really control the market. Wait until Thursday evening, you'll see ;)

1 Bitcoin equals 11290.00 US Dollar - 29/11/17. Might even be 12k by Dec 01 at this rate.
