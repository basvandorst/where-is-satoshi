I know the feeling. In 2017 i put myself in a -$20k hole day trading alts. I couldn't sleep for weeks and stopped doing the things i used to enjoy doing. Every second was spent checking coin market cap. all because I got greedy and I invested more than what I could afford to lose. 
But now I'm back in the green, paid off all my debts. And I'm sleeping well holding my 1 btc.  
I plan on dollar cost averaging starting sept. I will never day trade again

Im part of the 1btc club. But the feeling is surreal. I feel like it can drop to 0 tommorow.  I have no urge to sell it. But i dont feel rich yet. Haha

I took out 20k loan in 2018.  Lost 13k of that during bear market. Panic sold.   Was in debt. I did overtime in my day job for a year and a half and got back in the green in september of 2019.
Overall I made some pretty dumb decisions and it was not worth it taking out a loan at all. Why? Because i lost my life for 2 years. Constantly refreshing coin market cap, not attending family gatherings, at work all the time. 
It may work out for you, but it's just not worth the stress. Now i just DCA everymonth and stay off coinmarketcap.

Hopefully car dealerships start accepting BTC

Believe me. It wasn't easy decision to make. 
But then  i thought about "new car stress". Rise insurance cost, parking in the street and noticing every new scratch, registration, dmv, selling old car etc etc. 
Bitcoin in comparison seemed like the better move.  Especially since my current car perfectly fine.

Live in nyc. Cars have low mileage here because of the availability of public transport. And the astronomical cost of car insurance in nyc. Amd the costly headaches of Alternate side parking, metered parking,  etc etc.
 Its quite common for new yorkers to drive only on weekends and commute by train to work.

35k net after taxes, living expenses. 90k gross.  Live in nyc

Maybe i should make that 12k savings into 30k emergency fund.  Then dollar cost average all the way to 2025. Sounds like a plan

But im ok with being mediocre.  Dont need a super high paying job. 
I'm fascinated by Bitcoin and want to play my current hand perfectly without changing jobs haha. 
And also...i make 90k. Not the highest salary.  But in nyc, 90k pretty much means 35k net, after taxes and Rent

Do exchanges have their wallet passwords out in the open?? How do exchanges get hacked?
