Certificate looks OK to me. It was issued on 4th August 2016 and is a wildcard certificate for *.bitfinex.com but is a different cert to the one they are using on  which is also wildcard but was issued in October 2014. 
I'd expect them to be re-issuing all SSL certificates out of an abundance of caution.
Android can be funny with some certificates, or perhaps they replaced it after your post.

Technique  - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
... the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms.

Can the same arguments not be applied to Bitcoin nodes? Why not just have 3-5 nodes in different countries in massive data centres, with a much bigger max block size?
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:27:44
I included the results with and without them excluded.
The reason for excluding them is because the OP specifically asked about the influence Blockstream may have over the development - and maintainers (especially Test/QA maintainer) are less likely to be influencing feature development.

You're not wrong IMO. Mining centralisation is the problem, Core are capitalising on that problem to hold their position. Blockstream are funding Core Developers to fly around the world talking to Miners, persuading them to only run Core (See HK agreement).
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:06:46
Can you order that list by lines of code contributed, or some other better metric of influence? I think the blockstream employed developers would be at the top...

Isn't that how many improvements are produced? If someone has an idea of how to improve Bitcoin, and wants to code it up to show people how it works why be so negative? Eventually, if enough people support the idea it may well become 'compatible with the network'.

Sure, but from my reading of Theymos' suggestion - were talking about single digits or maybe 10's of controlling entities which is highly centralised compared to the current situation in Bitcoin (which many believe is already too centralised, but I believe it's decentralised enough).

You are referencing a post of yours from this same thread made just before my post. And even that post is dismissing the potential for conflict of interest rather than acknowledging it.


You've made a lot of assumptions there from my two paragraph post which contains mostly facts and the words "Weather there is an actual conflict of interest occurring is up for debate".


Sorry if I'm wrong on that. Can you elaborate on where you believe the potential conflicts of interest are within Blockstream?
When you say (in the comment you quoted) "None of blockstream's current or intended business plains are competing interests." - Are you saying that Blockstream's business plans don't include anything using off-chain transactions or that your don't believe off-chain and on-chain transactions are competing?
@_date: 2016-08-29 22:24:11
Out of 970 commits to the bitcoin git master branch in 2016, 221 (23%) of those have been from developers funded by Blockstream. If you exclude Wladimir and Marco who are Lead Maintainer and QA/Test maintainer you get 211 out of 711 commits (31%). 
Weather there is an actual conflict of interest occurring is up for debate - however there is a very clear potential for conflict of interest, and the fact Blockstream deny this concerns me - I don't think I'm the only one.

Although there are many people in this sub who think like that, there are people actively trying to do something about the problem.
Unfortunately Bitcoin has turned into a bit of a political nightmare over the past couple of years which has resulted in the problems you have experienced. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:30:25
Sure, but there is a big difference between 'blockstream only employ a few out of a hundred developers' and 'blockstream employ half of the top ten developers'. I'm not sure which is closest to reality - I might check later. 
Edit: I did some quick stats based on git shortlog on the master branch, excluding merges for 2016:
Out of 970 commits, 221 of those have been from developers funded by Blockstream. If you exclude Wladimir and Marco who are Lead Maintainer and QA/Test maintainer you get 211 out of 711 commits (31%). 
Excluding maintainers, Blockstream fund 4 of the top 10, or 7 of the top 20 core developers (by # of commits in 2016).

So you are increasing by 0.9 percentage points. If you were increasing by 0.9% the new fee would be 1.009%. 
You are increasing by 90% if the old fee was 1%.

@_date: 2016-08-31 07:11:28
So a qa / test maintainer who's job it is to write test code and keep code style consistent for example - they have as much influence over the project direction as someone working on say SegWit?
I'm not saying their roles are not important, but in the context of the OP about influence I thought it may be beneficial to post stats with and without them. If you disagree that's fine - feel free to only look at the stats with them included. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 10:00:47
That's talking specifically about timestamping and proof-of-work in the **Bitcoin** blockchain, not about 'blockchains' in general. I don't think the terms blockchain was even in common use at that time.

That's why I said 'fake valet' - e.g. you pull up outside a hotel, and give your car keys to someone claiming to work for the hotel but actually doesn't. Essentially they socially engineer your keys from you as the BitPay socially engineered the transfers from the exec. It's an interesting situation. It looks like BitPay and their insurer settled out of court in the end so I assume the insurer made a partial payment.

I understand how Bitcoin works. I don't think you understand the service Coinbase provide. 
When one sends Bitcoin to Coinbase they are giving complete control of their Bitcoin to Coinbase. They no longer own the Bitcoin. Coinbase can do with it as they wish, including moving it around within their own internal wallets if they want to. Most of it I expect is kept in cold storage. 
All the customer gets back is an IOU to repay the equivalent amount upon request. The customer cannot expect to be given the private keys to Coinbase's wallets.
Coinbase do offer a 'vault' service which I believe lets the customer manage the private keys - but really if one wants to have the private keys to their wallets, they don't need Coinbase or any third party service at all.

Some time ago that fee would have been fine, which is probably why Core suggested it. However the network is currently running at capacity which means you have to out-bid other users to get your transaction confirmed in a timely manor. 
Some newer wallets (including newer versions of Core I believe) will try to estimate the right fee to pay, but ultimately it is like a sealed bid auction so there is an element of luck.

They use BitPay, but I'm not sure how BitPay can reduce fees? Even if they implemented SegWit, doesn't that depend on the sender using SegWit?

Edit: Further reading: 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:02:45

@_date: 2018-01-10 20:17:07
Ok, here is the coinbase notification.
In the notification there is a currency field that says BTC. The overstock developers should be checking that says BTC and rejecting notifications that don't, or handling them if they are expecting other payments.
If of course the notification did say BTC and the customer used BCH then coinbase have a problem. But that would affect all merchants, not just overstock. Which makes me think overstock botched the integration. Perhaps coinbase could have not sent the notification for BCH, but perhaps overstock has enabled BCH on their control panel. But not updated their checkout systems yet. We just don't know.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:25:36

@_date: 2018-01-10 18:29:10

@_date: 2018-01-25 15:53:41
Because they wanted a base block size increase as well as (or instead of) the increase from SegWit.
@_date: 2016-04-01 15:14:12


I think the problem is they're not going to commit to something that is unproven. And once it has been proven, if it works as well as it's touted to, there would be no reason for them not to use it - so why the need for commitment?

@_date: 2018-01-04 10:21:50
Coinbase wanted the 2x bit, not the SegWit bit. SegWit was the compromise, but then they didn't get the 2x, so maybe they are a little salty. They have however added other coins which allows people to transact faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:48:43
This is the problem - who are you, or we, or anyone to decide what a 'wasteful' manner is. People paying sufficient fees should (and can - we can't stop them) be able to use it as they wish. It's not some precious thing we need to religiously protect - and if it is, it's already failed.
Their service clearly isn't 'junk' as it appears to be one of the most popular services using Bitcoin. If someone else can make a better service using SegWit and batched transactions then they will out-compete Coinbase. Perhaps they will. 
There are clearly engineering trade-offs with implementing SegWit, batching transactions etc which are leading to them being delayed/de-prioritised and focus being moved to other coins which don't have these issues.

If I was integrating with Stripe and their API returned a currency field which I ignored and assumed it was EUR, then enabled USD payments on my account and things when wrong I would be the one who'd goofed.
Not that we know that is what happened - it may well have been Coinbase's fault - we simply don't know.

It is very easy for someone, especially a miner, to produce many transactions to 'make' the blocks 100% full. So for that reason, you may as well simplify things and increase the blocks size 50kb every difficulty adjustment. Although that is a linear increase, and technology improves exponentially over time, so you should really increase the block size by a percentage amount each time, say 1%.
There have been many proposals to do this - all have been 'rejected'.

I don't think having a fee market is a bad thing, but I do think artificially limiting the supply side of it so early on is a mistake.

How are you defining 'valid'?
@_date: 2018-09-25 10:16:16




If you are conforming to all legal requirements why don't you want the tax authorities seeing finances? I'm not sure where you are based but I can't imagine there is a country where showing accurate information to tax authorities isn't a legal requirement.
As for going Bitcoin only - I suspect that you will lose 99%+ of your potential customers - but this depends on the product and market you are targeting. 
If you have a product people really really want they may adopt Bitcoin to pay for it (tech niches, products in legal grey areas, or for privacy reasons etc).
Where are you based, and what are you selling?

@_date: 2018-09-21 17:27:18


But the blocks would have been valid, according to the logic in Core 1.5.X and 1.6.X (before the fix). How are you defining 'valid'?
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:20:26
Are there likely to be patches released for older versions of Core affected by this bug? There have been a number of features added over the years which have been claimed to be 'opt in' and there has been much talk of never forcing anyone to upgrade. This seems to have gone out the window?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:44:25
Why would a miner mine any 0 fee transactions once the block reward has diminished? Miners will choose the minimum fees they accept (as they do now, even with huge block rewards).

If a miner did trigger the bug, would then fix then become a hard fork?
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:22:41
Yes, this is why RBF was controversial. It removes the small (but adequate in many use cases) amount of security zero-conf transactions had.
It's true that RBF transactions are flagged as such, but at the time old nodes didn't recognise that RBF flag so didn't distinguish RBF transactions from non-RBF. I'm not sure what the current status of this is across more recent versions of node and point of sale software is. Does the operator get alerted to RBF transactions?
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:19:27
If only we had some kind of alert system built into the network layer... :)

I think I'm right in saying that covered the majority of hashrate at that time. So can we conclude that *if* this bug had been exploited it would have required a hardfork fix plus rollback of all blocks mined after the exploiting block?
Kudos to the person who disclosed this to the developers.
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:32:14
Ah OK - so the witness data is separated, and ignored by older nodes. 
So any nodes which don't upgrade become zombies who are just relaying data without validating it?
Would it not be better to deploy by hark fork to force old nodes to upgrade and hence contribute to the security of the network?

How can a node crash bug cause lightning users to lose funds? (If that is what you are implying?)
@_date: 2018-09-19 10:07:56
AFAIK they would crash the node before they were relayed on. However things like FIBRE network between miners relays blocks fairly blindly, so this could crash large portions of the mining network.
@_date: 2018-09-19 09:04:41
Sorry, I wasn't being pedantic. 


This isn't true. Blocks are frequently orphaned when two miners find blocks close to each other.
I think it would be more correct to say that we are *almost* 100% guaranteed that all data going back after an hour is immutable and valid, and that approaches 100% the further back we go. The most recent block however is no where near 100% guaranteed.

Well you're not doing a very good job of that - the only EU country with a 27% VAT rate is Hungary.


The seller is commuting fraud (or, perhaps has less than £85k turnover? - unlikely) - which makes me suspicious as to the origin of the goods. Are they stolen, grey imports, counterfit?


If you are VAT registered and reclaiming VAT on your expenses and getting paid a net VAT repayment as you are not declaring it on your sales, that is VAT fraud. You may get away with it for a while, but if/when you get caught you will get put in prison for it. HMRC will pay close attention to items such as mobile phones as they are frequently used in carousel fraud.
I'd strongly recommend you re-think this business. If you buy the products legitimately you can reclaim the VAT you paid on the goods - as the name suggests it's only a tax on the value you add to the product. So if you buy in the UK from a legitimate seller at EUR600 inc VAT you can reclaim the EUR100 (20%) portion of that and then sell on at EUR787 +27% VAT (EUR1000 inc VAT to your customer) making your self EUR 387 on each sale.
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:38:03


This makes it sound like some kind of compression is used, or the blocks are taking up less space on the wire or on disk. This is not the case AFAIK. The blocks still take 2.26MB of data transfer and storage space (for nodes which support SegWit). They consist of ~1M of transaction data and ~1.26M of 'witness' data (e.g signatures).

What if the majority of the mining hashpower was running 1.5.X - &lt;1.6.3 (as I believe was the case when 1.6.3 was released)? I'm sure I've heard people say that any other client needs to be bug-for-bug compatible with Core, since Core is the reference client.
In this case the bug is very clearly unintentional. But what happens in the future if it's not so clear cut? Such as the redeeming of a channel closing transaction for the LN being disputed? Who's version of 'valid' do we use?
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:06:41
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I was saying that it is easy to reproduce a working test case for the inflation bug. Not that its easy to reproduce a working test case for the inflation bug which has exactly the same hash as Greg's test code. 
Although if I've understood the bug correctly even the latter may not be too difficult. 
I believe Greg will release the test case for the at some point in the future, once more of the network has upgraded I presume.
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:01:02

Given that it's reasonably likely that similar bugs exist but also haven't been discovered, is it safe to call anything a full node?
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:13:35


Nope, he says:


However, a large part of the arguments against raising the block size limit have been along the lines of 'larger blocks take longer to propagate over the network and increase orphan rates'. SW does nothing to fix that, as almost exactly the same amount of data (marginally more in fact) is still required to be transmitted weather using SW or simply increasing the block size limit without SW to allow the same number of transactions. Having a 1MB SW block + 3MB of witness data is the same as having a 4MB non-SW block.
There are of course lots of benefits to SW, but it is not a solution to scaling any more than simply increasing the block size limit is.

I'm not sure how you can make that assertion without LN being deployed.  Miners currently get revenue from block rewards which is around 100x greater than the revenue they get from transaction fees.  LN nodes only get revenue from fees.
Making a payment over Lightning will involve multiple 'hops', and therefore multiple nodes taking a fee. 
How are you so sure that LN fees will be less than Bitcoin fees?
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:49:44
If we switched to 8mb *today* it would mean that we are running at ~15% of the network capacity, rather than the current ~55%.
If growth continues, it will mean that the network is running at 30% capacity at the same point it would have been at 110% with the 1MB block limit... which could easily be within the next two years.

Good question! No, satoshi started in Jan 2009 I believe but as average block times are less than 10 mins due to ever increasing (so far) hash power the halvings are occurring a little faster than every 4 years. But I used 2008 as the start date so the rest of the years worked out :)

Ok thanks, 
So as far as the issues around block propagation and orphan rates for miners are concerned, there is no difference between a 4MB Seg Witness block, and if the block size limit had been raised to 4MB and a miner produced a 4MB block?
Can you clarify what you meant by


Do you mean setting the block size limit to 0.5/1/2 MB allowing 2/4/8 MB SW blocks, or do you mean setting the limit to 2/4/8 MB allowing 8/16/32 MB SW blocks (or something else!)?

Right, but they would be rejected by the rest of the network. In this case they would have been accepted by the majority of the network.

1. Because it was activated only once it has support from a large majority of the hashrate. 90% AFAIR. 
2. It's a valid BCH chain as their nodes use different consensus rules. It's not a valid BTC chain because it doesn't have as much combined PoW and changed some consensus rules.
3. It was abandoned after the bait and switch activation of SegWit was successful.
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:05:58
That sounds like a great way to do it, something like an annual or bi-annual hard fork. It would keep nodes up to date without taking anyone by surprise.
I fear Bitcoin's size is starting to become it's biggest weakness, if bold moves aren't being taken to keep it up to date it may well be overtaken by leaner currencies such as yours. Hopefully (no offence intended!) Bitcoin can keep ahead by watching other currencies and seeing what works and what doesn't, and implementing what does.

I understand the difference, however there is no way to measure 'general consensus', and we have a very good way to measure mining consensus. The entire point of Bitcoin is to establish consensus. The fact BIP101 uses 75% instead of 51% is to make sure that the switch over is by a clear and clean majority. Miners aren't going to be mining on BIP101 unless they can see a majority of the economic players are in support.

Sorry, I thought you were asking for a citation on the 1.6mb equivalent blocksize. 
The 12 month estimate for roll-out is based on the fact that Core is currently feature frozen for 0.12 (which doesn't include SW) and will be released Q1 next year. I would assume therefore SW (if it makes it to 0.13) will be released Q2 at the earliest. Other libraries such as BitcoinJ (which powers a large amount of SPV wallets) will then need to be updated, tested and released (say Q3 2016). Wallet developers (Multibit, Android Bitcoin Wallet etc) will then need to update, test and release their wallets and users will then need to update (during Q4). Online wallets (Coinbase, Blockchain.info etc) will also need to update their systems to create SW transactions (Q3/Q4 2016.
So that's what I'm basing 12 months on. That is 12 months until we see a significant portion of the network broadcasting SW transactions so that we can make use of the additional 0.6 - 3 MB of block space SW makes available.


You're ignoring the "rescaled to respect segwit's increase" part of Greg's plan. That means 1/2/4 MB for 2/4/8 and I assume ignores 102 and 202 as it would keep them at 1MB. It also means an lengthened duration to the roll-out (Greg failed to clarify when asked what he meant by "adjusting the schedule" - but I doubt he meant bringing it forward). See 
VCM looks excellent, but needs a lot of R&amp;D before its ready. The simple solution is to limit the number of bytes hashed per block. Gavin has already coded and tested this - see  and  - He chose a limit of 1.3GB hashed as the previous maximum was 1.2GB from the 'megablock' 
Have a great Christmas :)

I agree, the soft forks weren't contentions.
Now can you answer my question? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:07:04


That would require having the wallet software continuing to run after the initial tx broadcast, which doesn't work for most use cases, or requires a third party to watch and rebroadcast. I'm not sure how that improves decentralisation from what we have at the moment.
Also, if I went to my bank, and wanted to make a payment and they told me it may cost £1, £2, £5, £10, £20 or £50 and may complete in 10 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours or 24 hours, but they couldn't tell me in advance for sure which would happen, I wouldn't be too impressed.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:10:53
I think, but I could be mistaken, the 7 was the theoretical maximum before but the reality was 3 or 4 due to the signature data. I think this would bring us back to a practical maximum of 7.

Isn't that like saying 'Of course bitcoin transactions can be free, miners don't have to charge a fee'.
In the real world, there is a cost to providing a LN hub, or mining bitcoin, so of course the operators will charge fees.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:35:32
My multi-million dollar mining farm is paid for by block rewards. 
How are LN nodes going to pay for storage, bandwidth, security and the opportunity cost of having large amounts of BTC tied up in open channels?
@_date: 2015-12-22 10:05:15
I think the issue is that a number of the developers who have been against increasing the block size have used the uncertainty around hard forks as an argument against increasing the block size. 
They have painted themselves into a corner where they would be hypocritical to deploy SegWit (or anything else) via a hard fork, so are going to put off doing anything via hard fork for as long as possible. 
I think we'll have to wait until there is something required for Lighting that needs a hard fork before we will see Core support a hard fork.

Very cool idea. Even in 2d it would be interesting. Something like the output from WinDirStat 
@_date: 2015-12-07 12:19:42
Your holdings would not be affected until you mix them with coins mined on either fork from blocks after the fork happened. If there is any uncertainty after the fork simply don't spend any coins until it is resolved.

Let's see:
So yea, it goes &lt; 1 satoshi (effectively 0, unless the currency has been made more divisible by that time) in 2140. 
In 2044 it is 0.09765625 - which could be a lot of money if the price has continued to increase. If the price doubles every 4 years the USD valid of the block reward remains constant until 2140, which was the point OP was making.

Are you syncing the node from scratch? If so it will be using a huge amount of CPU and Disk I/O, so they probably monitor for that and have a clause limiting it. Especially on free accounts. 
I doubt they are worried about a few GB of bandwidth, or that you are running a Bitcoin node.

I think my prediction of the future is a reasonable assumption. Somethings are predictable. For example I'd be very confident in predicting that the sun will rise each day for the next 20 years - it doesn't mean I have some kind of special powers.
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:44:43
I don't think that's a terrible argument.
Lets say we have a restaurant with 100 seats, serving excellent food. There are 100 people who want to eat excellent food so this situation is great.
Suddenly, there is an influx of visitors to the town, and there are now 1,000 people wanting to eat excellent food. The restaurant with 100 seats says 'Hey, that's not an problem, we'll still get our 100 customers and life will still be good'. But there is now a regular queue outside, and most people have to wait for a table.
However, some enterprising person sees this and decides to open a restaurant across town, also serving excellent food, but with 1000 seats.
Not only do the 900 newcomers move to the new restaurant because the know they will be able to get a table, the original 100 also move to the new restaurant, because they are guaranteed a table without having to wait. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:46:15
Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but aren't miners getting a raw deal with softfork segwit?
With the additional segwit data being counted as 0.25x for the fee rate calculation, they are losing out on 0.75x the fees for the additional data they are processing, no?
Block X contains 1MB of data, which is 50% transaction data, and 50% segwit data. Average feerate is 20,000 sat/kB.
Before segwit softfork the miner would receive 0.2 BTC in fees (20,000sat x 1000k)
After segwit softfork the minder would receive 0.125 BTC in fees (20,000sat x 500k) + (20,000sat x 500k x 0.25)
With a hard fork, we could increase the max block size and remove the need for the 0.25x fee multiplier hack, so miners get the full fee?

Thanks Mike. Any ETA on Bitcoin XT with a (Gavins?) 20MB patch? I'd be happy to run a couple of nodes when it's ready. 
Is there anything someone only vaguely familiar with C++ can do to help?
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:48:41
So on the one hand you are saying that fees will be tiny, and on the other that holders will become LN nodes to grow their holdings?
I agree with you on the latter, but I think for it to be worth them doing that (e.g. taking their holdings out of cold storage) they would want non-zero fees. Also remember that each 'hop' on the LN will be taking a fee, so if I'm 10 hops from you there are 10 hubs taking a fee. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:04:49
I disagree. There are a number of degrees of censorship resistance and levels of decentralization. 
For example, Bitcoin will never be 100% censorship resistant because one entity with a big enough budget could always acquire more hashing power than the rest of the network combined. By your logic that means Bitcoin can never be resistant to any censorship?
The same goes for decentralization. If it was fully centralized, we'd have one miner producing 100% of the blocks via one node. If is was fully decentralized we'd have every participant having an equal chance of finding each block. At the moment we are somewhere between the two, much much nearer the fully centralized end of the scale.
The question is, I think, how much decentralization, or censorship-resistance, is required?
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:27:18
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:38:55
I'd argue the opposite. Keeping the block size low is a miner bribe. Bigger blocks = more work for more fees. Smaller blocks = same fees for less work (and more cost to the user).
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:03:38
What if a million people send it a satoshi each, and it then spends it's 1BTC on some drugs selected at random?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:31:02


There is already a minimum for relaying, but for a miner this isn't possible at a protocol level (they could just pay the minimum fee to themselves, which would cost them nothing aside from the opportunity cost of not including another fee paying tx). But yes, this would be expensive to carry out. 
The problem I see is that linear increases simply won't be sufficient 10, 20 or 50 years out. What are the arguments that bandwidth is going to stop increasing exponentially?
Off-chain scaling would be great, and when it comes, it should be able to out-compete on chain scaling without us having the intentionally cripple on chain transactions. A simple minimum relay fee should be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:52:38
No, sorry if I wasn't clear. My question was why are miners not trying to pull that attack off against XT/BIP101 at the moment?
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:46:33
I disagree, if we go too big too soon and there are technical problems, it can be un-done with a soft fork.
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:09:23


It is indeed!
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:43:09
Hi Peter, Thanks, I hadn't seen that before. If I'm understanding it correctly, the '7tx/s' already takes into account transactions which spend to multiple non-change outputs?
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:20:07
I've read a lot more than just that one mailing list post on the issue.
But yes, while there are some excellent improvements discussed the only capacity increases come from the SW soft fork (which is started to be equivalent to an increase of the block size to 4MB - although I've seen other estimates around 1.6MB). These increases can only be achieved once all software in the ecosystem has been updated, which would take 12 months+ as a conservative estimate.


Greg has clarified "2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase" to mean 0.5/1/2 MB - and we have no timeline for that.
So yes, I think the **block size** debate is far from resolved.
I think everyone agrees it would be cleaner to do SW as a hard fork, but certain devs can't agree to that as it would remove their 'hard forks are dangerous' argument against increasing the block size limit in future.
@_date: 2015-12-01 07:34:12

I think maybe when people talk of O(n^2) scaling they are talking in terms of an absolute worst case of bandwidth scaling. e.g. every single user runs a full node which makes a connection to every single other users full node. Of course that isn't reflective of reality where only a few thousand users are running a full node, and each node only connects to a handful of other nodes to relay transactions.
It would be like saying the internet scales on O(n^2) because every user could establish a connection each other at the same time.
Perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe or could clarify (not meaning to pick on anyone, but I've noticed those two to often mention O(n^2) as an argument against increasing the block size limit).

The Hardfork Wishlist on the Bitcoin Wiki mentions increasing the maximum block size


This was added by Gavin in Jan 2012, and doesn't seem to have been disputed since.
The [Prohibited Changes]( page states:


However it doesn't mention block size increase. 
It would appear that raising the max block size was not controversial back in 2012, but is now? What's changed aside from increased adoption?

@_date: 2015-06-11 11:47:05
The current default in Bitcoin Core is 750kb. I wanted to raise that to 1MB but the devs (inc Gavin) don't agree. 
Interestingly Gavin wanted to see if miners would manually increase their defaults once they realised they were missing out on fees as blocks filled up, which is exactly what seems to have happened here.
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:17:00
That's not what I'm doing. I'm saying if all else is equal, the coin with the largest capacity will win. 
Your're comparing Bitcoin to fiat currencies and totally ignoring other crypto currencies.
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:07:06
Ah, so you sent coins directly to a gambling site, they provided the reason of 'gambling' and you still 'dont know why'?
I'd keep the coins in a wallet of your own in future. Personally I use multibit hd which gives SPV security in exchange for not having to download the entire blockchain.
I have a feeling they only monitor the first address a transaction goes to so maybe send through a few different addresses if you want to keep letting other people control your coins.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:38:49
SDXC standard supports up to 2TB capacity.

Miners aren't going to support something which is not supported by a supermajority of full nodes, who are in turn not going to support something which isn't supported by a supermajority of users.
@_date: 2015-06-18 10:56:15
But the reality with Bitcoin is that full nodes make up ~0.1% of users  because the vast majority are using SPV - which makes Big O a very poor way to describe scalability of Bitcoin, does it not?

That's basically what gavins latest proposal is, but starting at 8mb next year then doubling every 2 years. Not sure what happens with the 32mb limit but I assume he will code it to scale past that. I think most of this debate should have waited until Gavin actually releases some code or a BIP - before then people dont even know exactly what they are arguing against.
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:11:28
Ok, sorry to try to pin you down a bit more, but I think there are a few people wanting to know your thoughts on this. 
By adjusting the schedule, do you mean increasing or decreasing?
I believe Adam's 2-4-8 proposal was based of the first three 'doublings' of BIP101, which would have been ~Jan 2016, ~Jan 2018 and ~Jan 2020. 
At what point do you see the increase to 2MB and 4MB happening?
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:59:56
I believe Gavin is working on this separately -  
I wouldn't have thought it would be part of the blocksize patches, but hopefully will come soon after.
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:16:05
How is this deployed as a soft fork? If a older client which doesn't know to count the bytes differently receives a block with say 1.5MB of data in it - isn't it going to reject it?
If is is possible to increase block size this way as a soft fork, why can't the block size limit be raise to say 8MB as a soft fork?
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:44:07
Doesn't sound like a problem to me :)

[BIP100 Draft]( Adam Back also proposed some kind of 'extension' blocks on top of the 1MB blocks which wouldn't require a hard fork, but would require all wallets to be updated.
I think even if not everyone agrees with Gavin/Mike's plan and actions, it's hard to deny they have provoked some good debate and hopefully some action will be taken soon.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:26:44

Edit: Just clarified my last sentence :)
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:39:22
If we do things too slowly, we could cause bigger problems that if we do things too fast. I'm going to also re-state that this is the block size *limit* that we are talking about here. If miners aren't comfortable creating blocks that big they can reduce their limits and just have to worry about processing other miners blocks along with the rest of the nodes. 
If they can't keep up? Maybe they shouldn't be holding the rest of the network back...

Does this mean we effectively have a block size limit of 2MB (per 10 mins)? Has the network centralised to the point where it is no longer resistant to censorship, are miners with 33% hash rate orphaning other miners blocks? Is the world ending?
Or... Is everything actually ok?
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:11:44
The counter-argument being, that if an 'altcoin' reaches 75% consensus, it is the 'true' Bitcoin, and the original becomes the 'altcoin'. Even then I feel 'altfork' would be a better description than 'altcoin'.
It would be like if coca-cola changed their recipe, some people would not consider the new recipe the true coca-cola, but eventually, if most people liked it, it would gain the status of the 'true' coca-cola.

Interesting work, hopefully some improvements with the distribution can be made. Perhaps bitcoind could internally rank the current connections based on latency, duration of connection and maybe some other factors, then send out newly found blocks sequentially to the best ranked peers first?
A quick spreadsheet of the blocks mined in the last 24 hours and the networks they came from. How many of these are likely to have &lt;=1MB upstream?

The assumption made by the OP is that because 6+Exahash has been added to the BTC network recetly, that 6+Exahash could have instead have been used to attach BCH. This is false, *unless* it is all controlled by the same person - which seems unlikely.
Bitcoins security is based on the fact that the network is decentralised and that to attack the network a larger portion (50%+) would have to collude to do so, and even if they did - they would be better off financially receiving the block rewards than attacking devaluing their own investment. Check section 6 of the whitepaper.

The problems in China are to do with cross border bandwidth. As you say they have most of the hashing power (~60% I believe is within China), so Chinese miners actually get an advantage as they receive blocks mined within China faster then miners outside of China do.
Question - what happens if there is a prolonged net split between China and the rest of the world? Presumably China mines its own Chain faster then ROW mines its own chain and then when the net is rejoined the ROW chain is orphaned?

I'm in the UK and bank with HSBC. I've purchased through   and 
I've not purchased more than 1BTC at a time through any one site, and never had any problems. Out of the three I've mentioned bittylicious is my preferred choice.
When sending the payment it's usually direct to the sellers bank, and the reference is just a random ID for the transaction. I haven't mentioned anything to do with BTC to HSBC but haven't tried to hide anything either. I haven't heard anything saying they are specifically against it.
If you are purchasing larger quantities it may be worth buying on an exchange. I've not done this but I'm fairly sure Kraken, Coinflooe and maybe even Coinbase exchange work in the UK, but AFAIK none of them accept UK Faster Payments so you'll have to wait a few days to get your cash in/out. Never leave anything on an exchange.

@_date: 2015-06-19 10:53:08
I think part of the issue is that there are more than two sides to the debate. Initially it appeared that it was two sided:
* Side A wanted to keep the 1MB limit and scale with off-chain transactions
* Side B proposed an increase to a 20MB limit on the original Bitcoin blockchain.
However, despite the drama, we seem to have come a long way towards meeting in the middle:
* At least some of Side A are willing to increase the block size limit, via BIP100 or other proposals.
* Side B are about to release their own BIP based on 8MB blocks and a periodic increase.
I think eventually (and fairly soon) we will get a decision, and hopefully that will come via a pull request to Bitcoin Core implementing Side B's BIP with a parameters argeed on by the vast majority. 
I really hope that the people with influence over this can put aside any personal differences and emotions, and not outright reject a solid proposal out of spite, or commercial interests. If that was the case we'd probably end up with a hard fork which would be a little messier, but in which Bitcoin would survive and prosper.
Feel free to replace Side A with 'Blockstream' and Side B with 'Gavin and Mike' ;)

No worries :) 
IMO it was for anti-DoS rather than anti-spam. The difference is subjective however I would say that DoS is an attacker trying to harm the network by sending large volumes of transactions, whereas spam is sending lots of unsolicited transactions to uses for promotion of their own service. 
For example a company could send a free transaction to each UTXO with an OP_RETURN including their web address - that would be spam. Someone creating a 1GB block of valid transactions knowing it would exceed the ram limits of some nodes on the network at the time would be DoS.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:34:32


SW soft-fork (which includes adding more consensus data to the coinbase field), and 0.25x accounting for segwit data seems like a hack. It would be better to hard fork SW and increase the block size limit to 2MB at the same time. There is consensus for that among just about everyone so it wouldn't be a 'controversial' hardfork. 
It would also mean miners get paid fairly for the data the process, rather than in full for some of it and 0.25x another part of it.
The only issue is that its possible to craft large transactions which take a long time to validate, but there some simple guards could be put in place to stop that (see BIP101).

Ok, so that quote is from here: 
And it has nothing at all to do with block size. 
Satoshi was talking about the threshold for the number of free (yes, there used to be a set amount of space in each block to allow free transactions) transactions to include in a block.
Also, 'flood' doesn't imply spam. It implies, IMO, a DoS attack.
Edit: Interestingly in that same thread Satoshi also said, regarding free transaction space - "I don't think the threshold should ever be 0.  We should always allow at least some free transactions."

I understand this, and agree that under real world conditions we will see more transactions in a SegWit block - but to say that SegWit increased the maximum number of transactions which can be put into a block is not true, because every transactions in a SegWit block *must* also be able to fit into an equivalent non-segwit block without the witness data, and witness data was never required (otherwise the blocks would not be valid to a non-segwit node). In fact I believe that the segwit style transactions have a very small overhead compared to an equivalent non-segwit transaction.

Is it possible to simulate this including real channel capacities? I assume that information is available since it's required for routing actual payments, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:27:07


If that is true, how are the SegWit blocks relayed to old nodes including all transactions within 1M so that they can maintain their UTXO? For every SegWit block, it also has to be possible to create a valid non-segwit block containing the same number of transactions but with a size less than 1M bytes.

I agree DNS isn't great - but it is widely used. Am I correct in saying that a man-in-the-middle attack would be used in the same way for a DNS entry such as the one I proposed, as it would for a website or email server?

I thought I'd have a go at getting the private key to scan, and learnt a bit about QR codes along the way.
It turns out that this code uses error correction level 'L' which at 7% is the lowest. Had it used level 'H' (30%) it would probably have been possible to get the private key. Having two images which had the black circles in slightly different positions helped as well as having the black circle covering an orientation marker which we could recreate.
I got this far: 
Red = Alignment
Purple = Orientation
Green = Spacing
Blue = QR Version
Aqua = Timing
Yellow = Format Information
Burgundy = ~7% which we wouldn't need to recover
Orange = the bits that we would need to recover
There are 160 ish bits which remaining unknown, so it could be brute forced within 1.46e+48 attempts, or so.

Yes, but if the coins are sold, the gain in this case is $99.17, on which the tax is paid. I'm in the UK so not familiar with US (I assume) taxation, however lets use 20% for example. The IRS take 20% ($19.84) of the $99.17 gain, leaving a net gain of $77.33. So not 'back in the red'. 
For taxation to change a gain to a loss, it would have to be &gt; 100%.

That's a cost to the attacker of 4.2 Million USD in lost revenue (not to mention that they would need to hold 16.6..% of the hashrate to sustain the attack, and hope that their victims are asleep for 2 weeks straight.
And what do they gain? A reduction in difficulty for everyone, including the 25% competitors they attack was aimed at? How do they profit from that? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:10:52


Yes, I was included fees in the 'block rewards' - if the block size is increased a larger number of transactions will be allowed which will hopefully fully compensate for the deminishing reward, which will be helped in USD terms if the BTC:USD price continues to increase.

That's just plain wrong. 
Lets say I'm CPU mining on the current block chain, and have ~0% chance of finding a block at the current difficulty. Then there is a power outage in everywhere in the world except in my bedroom for 10 hours. Do I suddenly start finding 1 block every 10 minutes on my CPU miner?
The only reason you get a 25% chance of finding a block with 25% of the global hash rate is *because of the difficulty re-targeting*.

So let's say I've set my Bitcoin Client up to generate new coins, and it's been happily generating blocks up to 1M since 2009. Your nice friendly opt-in 10k Soft-Fork comes along and suddenly my blocks are no longer accepted by the network?
Changing from 1000k bytes to 10k bytes **is** a change. It's just a tightening of a rule instead of loosening of a rule. 
SegWit goes further by removing information from the blocks which it relays to older nodes so while they fit within the old rules, the older nodes do not have the same information as the newer nodes. This could be taken a step further, to relay empty blocks to old nodes, and move all transactions to a new data structure, is that still a soft-fork? 
This is why i'm saying we shouldn't takin in terms of Hard Fork === Bad, Soft Fork === Good. But rather call everything a Fork and discuss what's actually being changed and who is affected and how.
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:31:13


If there are 20MB worth of transactions in 'the mempool' (as there are right now, according to Johoe's Mempool you linked to) and a miner makes a block, 95% of the pending transactions won't get into that block. I'm not sure how you can say that only includes transactions with 'very low fees'. And then your solution? Everyone increase their fees? It would result in exactly the same position, or prices out the people who can't afford it.
Can you put a figure on what you would class as 'very low fees' and an 'appropriate fee'?


What you are doing here is reducing bitcoins use cases, and reducing access for less wealthy people. For all the talk of 'be your own bank' and of helping people to achieve financial sovereignty - the people who need that most are being priced out by an artificially limited supply. 
We don't need an OPEC for Bitcoin to centrally limit the supply of block space.
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:29:17
I don't think you understand what a stock split it. 
The equivalent of a stock split in bitcoin would be increasing the divisibility of one 'Bitcoin' to 10 decimal places for example. The number of the smallest unit would increase, but these would be allocated equally between existing holders and the market cap would remain the same.
Yes, a contentious hard fork with a less than super majority of miners on either side wouldn't be good for confidence, and would likely result in a temporary reduction in the market price, but it would be the same as any other negative news event - 'exchange X gets hacked', 'china bans bitcoin' etc. Confidence would recover and, IMO, Bitcoin would be stronger for it.

And if true, wouldn't it be because the main chain is unreliable due to slow confirmation times due to small blocks? Companies will see 'trusted' wallets such as Coinbase as less risky as they are less likely to attempt a double spend on an unconfirmed transaction.

ViaBTC and bitcoin.com Pool are generating with BU, which is something like 10% of the hashrate. Not sure about other pools as they've not categorically said one way or another AFAIK. Slush I assume is just signalling preferences as they allow voting for a fair few combinations of upgrades.

@_date: 2017-02-07 08:03:02
I wasn't advocating it, I was pointing out the bias in your post. 
But since you asked I think an 8GB **limit** on block sizes by 2036 would see bitcoin in a much better state than a 1M limit with a bit of extra space from discounting the witness data. I don't think having the limit a couple of orders of magnitude above typical to volume is a bad thing as that was the situation when the 1M limit was added.
Since you didn't answer my question, 18 years ago most people were still using dial up services, up to 56kilobits per second. Today people are on dsl or fibre, typically up to 50 megabits per second. So my prediction for 2036? 50 gigabits per second will be available to many people. That's a 36GB block transferred in under 10 seconds.
What do you think the max block size should be in 2036, and how should we get there?

So for the described attack to work, it would have to be sustained for at least one difficulty period to get any meaningfully reduction in hash rate. Which is incredibly expensive for the attacker. And all he achieves is making the difficulty target easier for everyone, including those he was attacking.
Basically, it's not a viable attack vector the way you have described it.

I hadn't thought about that scenario.. but maybe.. what I was thinking of was the following:
Let's say someone who has a SegWit address decides to send me 0.5BTC. Their SegWit address contains 1BTC so their wallet sends me 0.5BTC to my non-SegWit address, 0.4BTC back to a new SegWit address (as change) and 0.1BTC is left for the miners fee.
Do I see that as an unconfirmed transaction in my non-SegWit wallet, or do I have to wait for 1 confirmation before I can see it?
@_date: 2017-02-02 13:49:47


So are soft forks, aren't they? If I were to persuade 51% of minders to reject all blocks greater than 10kb in size, that would be a soft fork, no?
I think too much distinction is placed on weather a fork is 'soft' or 'hard' - rather than which rules it attempts to change.

Currently when someone sends me a transaction, I see it as unconfirmed (almost instantly) until it is mined into a block.

Yup, I think this practice was started by GreenAddress with their 'instant transactions' - it's a good idea but I'm not sure it's a good direction for Bitcoin to be going in. It's basically adding trust to a trustless system.

Anything powered by BitcoinJ isn't - AFAIK.
Also (AFAIK) all coins need to be sent to a segwit address first before they can then be used in a SegWit transaction, so there will be a delay before the extra space increase can be fully utilised.

Yes I agree it's confusing, hence the quotes around 'SPV' in my comment. I was referring to the system wallets like Multibit use. In practice they will accept some hard forks (like a block size limit increase).
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:46:30
The majority of validating miners rejected it too (100% in fact, even the BU node which mined it rejected it). Some SPV miners mined on top of it for at most 60 seconds before also rejecting it.
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:39:09
I think you may be confusing BU with BIP101 which had a 75% activation threshold?
The excessive block size bug wasn't great, but the design goal of BU is that excessive blocks aren't a problem, and BU clients on the network handled that block as intended, which of course meant the miner who created it had the block orphaned and lost the reward once it was clear it was excessive. Still a stupid mistake, fair enough. Hopefully they will learn from it.
Regarding unlimited block sizes, they are not literally unlimited. They are limited by the majority of hashpower. This is exactly the same as any other parameter. If &gt;50% of the hashpower wants to change it, they can. BU just makes this easier and more co-ordinated for one parmeter, the max block size. As for it not working, can you explain how Bitcoin survived for the first 6 years while the 1MB hard limit wasn't touched? Can you point to where in the Whitepaper it mentions an block size limit as a parameter of the system, or at all? Can you explain why miners set minfeerates before blocks were consistently full?
Regarding off-chain payments. Yes, they may be a better solution, but today they do not exist in any meaningful way. When they do exist, they should be able to compete with on-chain payments on their own merits, not because of an arbitrary artificial limit on on-chain transactions.
Bitcoin *is* a democracy. One CPU, One Vote. Majority rules. Perhaps the people who don't like that, should start their own system, where they magically make any change require 100% consensus using either some undiscovered mathematical technique, or a centralised set of trusted keys.

Right, but your link shows dynamically suggested fees, i was looking for 'a figure' - e.g. $1, $10, $100? There must be a point, in your opinion, where fees are too high?


In which case everyone will use these instead of on-chain transactions? So why restrict the on-chain limit if off-chain transactions are better in every way?
What I suspect, is that these second layer solutions will not be better in every way, and will only be able to compete by the main chain have artificially high fees induced by a restricted block size limit. This plan will not work long-term, as miners will eventually defy Core and raise the block size limit anyway.

Another minor point in your article which may be confusing is:


BU's user preferences are communicated in the coinbase of blocks, so pretending to be many users is tricky. Of course, a large mining pool could communicate one preference but enforce another, but all that would serve to do is destroy their the value of their own income - like with everything else in Bitcoin, the incentives make it more profitable for them to be honest.

No they can't. You can't take a coin from one side of the fork and spend it on the other side. A fork would create two parallel sets of 21 million coins. Anyone at any time can create a fork with 21 million coins on it, no need for a majority of has power to do so.

Technically, yes, read the whitepapaer. "Once cpu, One vote."
However, miners won't want to produce blocks which aren't accepted by nodes, so it is the job of the economic nodes to validate the work of the miners. And it's the users who provide the economic activity. So the incentives work well (as has been demonstrated over the pas seven years).

But it does directly increase validation speeds (as well as code improvements for example libsecp256k1) and it does indirectly increase bandwidth.
The speed of light isn't a limiting factor on bandwidth any more than the speed of sound is a limiting factor on the volume of a loudspeaker. The limiting factors are the wavelength and frequency of the light, and the microprocessors at each end - the latter being affected by Moore's Law.
BIP101 uses a growth rate which is slower than Neilsen's Law predicts, for example, and that is considered by many as 'too aggressive'!.

Some people have their own very strange definition of censoring. It appears to be:

* miner bumping the priority of a transaction at no cost to the user = censoring
By this definition, advocating for RBF is advocating censorship?

Bitcoin was designed so that most users would use SPV wallets.
What was the cost of a computer with 1GB RAM, 10GB Disk and a mid-level CPU in 2009, compared to a computer with 2GB RAM, 50GB Disk and mid-level CPU today? What will a computer with 4GB RAM, 200GB disk and mid-level CPU cost in 2023?
I suspect they will all be fairly similar, and all be around the minimum requirement for running a full node at the time.

Yes, they still see them as valid but they can no longer actually validate them under the new rules. So if someone produces and invalid SegWit block all the old nodes will think 'Ok, that looks valid' when actually it is not.

Miners are free to set whatever minimum feerate they want.

Not that there is anything wrong with single entities funding multiple nodes. In fact it is a good thing IMO.
@_date: 2016-03-02 09:36:28
40 sat/byte is probably not accurate. The actual cost for empty space is probably less, however the cost of the spare 0.1mb of space in 1mb blocks will be exactly the same as the cost of the additional 1mb of space available in 2mb blocks, so the cost of the attack does increase 11x (assuming 0.9mb of legit transactions, and 1mb vs. 2mb). 
At some point, the cost of attack becomes so expensive that is not worth attempting.

This is the key point - Bitcoin was designed to transition to using fees in the distant future as block rewards approach zero. What's happening now is capacity is being artificially limited so a relatively low number of transactions are having to pay increasingly high fees as we run out of space.

You've edited your post a lot since my last reply, so I'll reply to this version here:




There is no need to do all the conversions between number of txs and back to fees, as the fee is specified in satoshis per byte. You can simply say:
0.1MB (10,000 bytes) of fees at 40 satoshis per byte = 0.4BTC ($1,73 USD)
1.1MB (110,000 bytes) of fees at 40 satoshis per byte = 4.4BTC ($1,903 USD) - which is 11x the above.


If you re-read my post, I was saying that 8MB blocks would need 77x as much as 1MB blocks (not 77x as 2MB blocks).

When a full block turns up with thousands of transactions that nobody else has in their mempools I think people will notice. Especially if something like thin blocks is in use.
If they create and broadcast the transactions beforehand, they would have to include fees and risk another miner picking them up and taking the fees, which would make it incredible expensive to do over three months just to get a small increase in the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:55:48
Would it not be better to use some kind of self-correcting algorithm for the max block size, similar to how the difficulty target currently works. Doubling every 2 years relies on accurately predicting the future and is fairly arbitrary. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:00:30
I don't follow the logic - surely with a larger sample size, there is *less* chance of single miner with &lt;5% has power getting lucky?
I'd be interested to see the math. Is it really easier when using 1000 blocks sampled after each block than using 2016 blocks sampled every 2016 blocks?

Do you not think there is a strong correlation between miner consensus and the consensus of the network as a whole? 
What are the incentives for miners to go against the wishes of the network as a whole with regards to a block size increase?
Also, I don't think it needs to be 'all or nothing' - wouldn't a compromise of, say, 75% miner support be better, so that we dont end up with a 50/50 split which of course would cause big problems. 75% + delayed activation gives anyone on the 25% side time to switch over and by the time it actually activates we should be very close to 100%.

There was a 1mb block produced a while ago that took around 60 seconds to validate, and hashed 1.2gb of data, which I believe is what Gavin based his 1.3gb limit on. Libsecp256k1 should make that validation speed 2 or 3 times faster. SegWit doesn't fix this either as although it is fixed for SegWit transactions - old style transactions are still valid, so it will need to be fixed if increasing the hard limit at any point in the future even with SegWit deployed.
@_date: 2016-03-08 22:01:15
Right, so the question is, what is more likely to activate?

@_date: 2016-03-10 14:25:26
I understand that by changing the window and how it's checked that the chances of activation are different between the two methods. Perhaps there is good reason to change it, but it would be great to see some analysis of exactly what the equivalent percentage would be. 93%, 94%? I would also have thought that using 2016 blocks instead of 1000 would actually make the count **more** accurate, does that counter the massively reduced sample rate? I don't know.
But, there absolutely was discussion of reducing the threshold. Or do you agree with Greg that "There was no discussion of reducing the activation threshold in the meeting"?

Hopefully over time BTC will become less volatile, but the best way to think about it is the same as any other foreign currency. For example if you are in the US and negotiate a contract with a supplier in the UK you can price it in either USD or GBP, or put in measures to deal with exchange rate differences. You can also purchase the foreign currency or some of it at the start of the deal to hedge against movements in the exchange rate.

Miners are not competing with each other to find the next block in the way you imply.
If you have 10% of the has power you will find on average 1 block every 100 minutes. If everyone else apart from your turns off their miners entirely you will still on average only find 1 block every 100 minutes.
This will be the case until the next difficulty re-target, which I why I assumed that was what you were talking about when claiming a miner gained an advantage by wasting competitors hash-rate.

The graph there shows the estimated fee to get into the next block is currently 38862 satoshis (~$0.17) **per KB**. If you have a larger transaction (lots of inputs, or outputs, or multisig etc) it could be several KB, so $1+

I don't think that's the correct definition of spam. Spam is generally unsolicited or unwanted communication. I don't think spam even applies to the blockchain, aside from transactions who's sole purpose is to send unsolicited messages to someone (e.g. dust transactions, transactions designed only to write OP_RETURN data to the blockchain etc). 
If I create millions of transactions with HELLO WORLD in the OP_RETURN with no economic purpose, but pay a higher fee than other users, are they not spam?
I agree Bitcoin doesn't have good tools for price discovery, but think it shouldn't need them until the block reward diminishes :)

Interesting to see discussion of reducing the activation threshold for version-bit forks. I assume this is (possibly subconciously, giving the benefit of the doubt) due to Core not having the full support of miners on some policies.

I think the point being made was that Blockstream employs a number of Core developers, and Core has a low threshold to veto any changes. Therefore Blockstream as a company can veto any changes (such as this proposal).
No one is suggesting Blockstream is some kind of self-aware AI with it's own Github account.
I also think if IBM suddenly started employing 10 Core developers, who started blocking changes from other devs and pushing for changes which were clearly in IBM's self interest - the Bitcoin community would be justifiably against that.

No it doesn't. You can't take a coin from one side of the fork and spend it on the other side. A fork would create two parallel sets of 21 million coins. Anyone at any time can create a fork with 21 million coins on it, no need for a majority of has power to do so.
If we were discussing a hard fork which increases the block reward in some way, I would agree with you and I suspect most people would too, so that fork wouldn't be accepted by just about everyone.

That's just false. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply don't remember it, but it's fairly clear in the [logs](
















Do you completely discard the possibility that some miners may be actively against activating the fork? The elephant in the room here is that ~4% and rising of the hashrate is running non-Core clients which may well not vote for SegWit as a soft fork.

I think that's highly unlikely, and should be discounted entirely when planning for the future of Bitcoin. Anything which could cause that (e.g. global nuclear warfare) would make Bitcoin block propagation speeds fairly irrelevant.


By artificially small I am referring to a hard coded limit (e.g. MAX_BLOCK_SIZE), rather than allowing miners to allow blocks sizes they desire.
A single processing bottleneck (the blockchain) is inefficient, but its also a key design feature of Bitcoin. I'm all for moving transactions off-chain (via Payment Channels, Lighting, Web wallets etc) but the block size should not be capped to encourage that - especially not by the companies who are developing the off-chain solutions.

I'm fairly sure Luke could, and probably has, successfully double spent. However - he has a very good knowledge of Bitcoin. Average Joe doesn't, and only has the tools made available to them by developers. What RBF does is gives Average Joe the tools they need to double spend, and greedy miners an easy way to allow them to.
Hopefully, pools which support RBF will become known and ethical miners will move their hashpower elsewhere. I think this happened already when F2Pool turned on RBF based on a patch by Peter Todd some time ago - there was a backlash from the community and they quickly reverted.
@_date: 2016-03-22 11:09:38
It's not an "official" proposal. It was proposed by two core developers at a meeting with a number of miners/pool operators.
For the timetable to be maintained, a 2MB hard fork would have to be coded, merged, tested and released by Core by the end of July 2016.
Edit: Oh, and the released code would need to be adopted by 95% of mining hash-rate too, to trigger the year long activation period so the hard fork could happen in July 2017.

A 1GB mempool with only 1BTC of fees in it would have an average feerate of 0.1 satoshi per byte, so wouldn't exist today due to minimum feerates. Fees less than 1 satoshi are not possible without being 0, so the worst actual case (even if everyone did set their minfeerate to 0) would be 1 sat/byte fee, or 1,000,000,000 satoshis (10BTC) for a 1GB block.
The default min feerate in Core is 10 sat/byte, so realistically a 1GB block would need to have 100BTC worth of fees, but likely even more if not all transactions used the absolute minimum fee.
If blocks were larger, it's unlikely a 1GB mempool backlog would have built up, as other miners would have already processed the transactions, unless there were no blocks for a long time, or an attacker was spending 100+BTC as well as having the network/processing capacity to broadcast 1GB worth of transactions within 10 mins (and hope they all get relayed).
An attacking miner could craft a 1GB block, but then wouldn't get the speedup of the relay network, and their 1GB block would be orphaned.

Do you not think that having larger capacity creates a more useful system, which in turn attracts more miners and node operators and creates a more secure network? 
Why do you think Bitcoin has managed to remain secure until 1MB and then suddenly the system will self-destruct if we go to 2, 4 or 8MB? 
Do you think we should instead reduce to 500kb or 100kb blocks to ensure security of the system?

I'm not sure your maths is correct, you are assuming there are zero legitimate transactions.
If the block size limit is 1MB and there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker only needs to pay for &gt;0.1MB to cause problems.
If the block size limit is 2MB and there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker needs to pay for &gt;1.1MB of legitimate transactions, costing 11x as much.
8MB blocks need 7.1MB, or 71x as much...

Segwit and a 2mb hard fork block size limit both have the same effect on propagation times, so can be done in either order. Hark fork is simpler, has miner support and will likely get capacity increased faster so IMO should be done first.
Running a live system into capacity limits is not a good was to 'gain knowledge to improve the system'.
SegWit should be done as a hard fork without the virtual block size increase hack, and we can increase to 4mb or 8mb or whatever is acceptable at that time once other improvements have been made.
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:19:39
The fees are not 'lost' - they go to the miner who included the transaction in the block they mined as part of the 'coinbase' transaction.
As the block reward diminishes, fees will become more important. There are two ways in which fees to miners can increase:
1) The same number of users pay higher fees for their transactions
2) The same fees are paid by a larger number of users (This requires increasing the protocol-restricted maximum block size limit)
@_date: 2016-03-10 10:54:31
Sure, but I think at least some fairly prominent developers do feel that their contributions are being suppressed. There is a a fairly obvious (to me at least, and I don't think I'm the only one) clique of developers centered around those who work for Blockstream.
If you look at the two 'scaling bitcoin' conferences for example - many developers turned up and presented ideas - but the core roadmap document ignored them all in favour of a ideas developed/backed by Blockstream employees.
You could argue that it's simply that Blockstream employees have the best ideas and most expertise, but while that may account for some of the bias, I don't think it accounts for all of it.

They were going to adopt Classic, until Adam, Luke and Matt flew over and had a private meeting with them where they promised a 2mb hard fork after SegWit, which they won't deliver. There were some very biased (and that's being kind) slides from the meeting presentation. 
I think it's just going to take a bit more time for the miners in China to see through the stalling tactics. Most miners have wanted bigger blocks for a long time (e.g a majority once signed blocks with 8MB or used BIP100 style votes for 8MB, but at the same time they have an irrational loyalty to Core which is hard to break.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:48:44
SegWit gives an maximum block size of between 1.6 and 2mb when all bitcoin software has switched to using it. By the time it has been deployed it will already be insufficient.

@_date: 2017-03-30 18:50:06


Yes, that seems like a very good reason to want it to grow. Note that growing the base block size also grows space for extra witness data, and let's the market decide the value of each, so on and off chain transactions can compete on a level playing field. 
You must see that the developers building off chain solutions are the ones pushing hardest for discounted witness data?

Easily change per node, but you'd have to convince a large number of nodes to change it to get a 1GB mempool with only 1BTC in fees.


Fair point!




An attacking miner crafting their own block would not get the speedup because his transactions would not have already been seen by the relay network, so would have to be relayed in full. 
A non-attacking miner simply trying to mine 1GB of transactions would be collecting 100BTC in fees due to the 10sat/byte min fee rate everyone else is using. It's very unlikely other miners would have simply left those transactions sitting in the mempool for this miner to mine, if block size was not restricted.

It's not as one sided as you make it. It is backwards compatible but all users have to upgrade to take advantage of it. It's discount structure means miners earn less for processing the same data compared to a straight block size increase, and it gives 4mb as a Max block size for a hostile miner.

The block was ignored by miners too (inculcating the node that mined it), if it had been accepted by a majority of miners things would have been very different - but yes you are right that the nodes have to accept the changes too, and as long as some miners are still mining the old rules they have a choice to choose the lower-powered chain.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:26:22
SegWit makes all new transactions appear to older nodes as ANYONE_CAN_PAY so they they can't do any validation on them at all. It also increases the block size by counting data in a new way (0.25x for some of the data). I have no real problem with this, but you can't argue that Gavin is 'exploiting a loophole' with this BIP, and say SegWit isn't exploiting a loophole.

I think we disagree on this point, which of course we can't prove without knowing the motive of the attacker(s).
Do you think that the people doing the spam attacker were thinking:
"We'll do this so that the UTXO set in bloated which will cause problems for Bitcoin in the future"
or 
"We'll do this to congest the network right now"
Edit: 100sat/byte was just an arbitrary example. The point was that watever the lowest fee transactions is, the attacker needs to fill the rest of the block with transactions of a higher feerate in order to displace the transaction. If the blocks already full they can displace other transactions with one transaction.

Yes, I didn't word that very well. The increase available is only proportional to the number of users who upgrade.
So if 10% of transactions are SegWti transactions, the max block size will be around 1.07MB. 50% = 1.35MB, 100% = 1.7MB.
There is a lot of software which has been written over the past 7 years which can create transactions which will need to be upgraded so it's not going to happen overnight, and we probably won't reach close to 100% for years.

But why would miners attempt to do something if they didn't feel the rest of the network would support it? If 100% of miners tried to double the block reward it wouldn't work as it would be rejected by everyone else on the network. We don't have any reliable way to measure whole network consensus so we use miner consensus. It's not perfect but it's more than good enough. The only people I've seen argue against it are those that are using it as a distraction to argue against a specific change they don't agree with.

Not for miners, who would make more with a straight block size increase.


No, this is not ture. SegWit does not reduce bandwidth requirements. Exactly the same data has to be broadcast by the miners whether the witness data is segregated or is part of the main block.




So, if a miner wants to make a really large block, with SegWit they can make a 4MB block by mining lots of 15/15 multisig transactions. Typical usage (once every single transaction creating piece of software has been updated to support SegWit) is estimated to allow blocks up to 1.7MB.
I actually don't think the occasional 4MB block would be a problem for the network to handle, but this type of 'miners creating big blocks' attack was repeatedly used as a reason _not_ to raise the block size limit.

If block size is increased in line with technological growth, the cost of running a node will remain the same - and more users will mean more people running nodes. Bigger blocks propagate much much faster now than when that text was written by nullc in 2011, thanks to Compact Blocks, XThin and private relay networks between miners.
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:42:30
You may want to look at reducing your 'maxconnections' if you are concerned about bandwidth usage. And if you are concerned about disk space look at the 'prune' option. Once xthin/compact blocks are more widely used the spikes for propagating blocks will be greatly reduced.
Also note that even with a limited 1MB block size, you are still having to relay the hundreds of megabytes of backlogged transactions, and if they fail to make it into a block and get re-transmitted with a higher fee, or replaced with RBF, you need to use additional bandwidth to relay those duplicate transactions.

What you are saying there is spam is subjective, so we need to invent an objective way to measure it, and also call that spam? Why not use a different term?


No, I guess it relies slightly on alturism of miners, but it worked well before. It would and did help prevent spam attacks where the spammer continually sends the same coints to himself, as the spammers coins lose priority very quickly, lessening the effect or increasing the cost of the attack.


It doesn't entirely solve it, but it makes it more expensive, which it's self is a deterrent. If, hyperthetically, there was no block size limit at all and infinite capacity on the network, the attacker would have 0 chance of success and would therefore not start the attack in the first place.

Similar to most open source projects. Anyone can contribute and create a 'pull request' containing their proposed changes.
Satoshi was originally in charge, then Gavin, and now Wladimir J. van der Laan gets the final say on what gets 'Merge' into the codebase, which is released periodically.
For uncontroversial improvements this works very well, but for controversial changes (even when the status quo is worse than any of the tabled options) it can be problematic, and can turn political in some cases. Managing open source projects can be very hard and many fail, or get 'forked' because of it and other developers creating competing versions. It's then up to the users to choose which version they want to follow.

OK, so I guess we can agree the definition is that Soft Forks fork unwilling Miners off the network, and Hard Forks fork unwilling Nodes of the network. 
As for 'SPV' users, then it comes down to the type of property being changed by the Fork?
You then get 'Soft-ish' Forks like SegWit and P2SH, which don't force old nodes off the network but give them an altered view of the network, so while they believe they are in consensus, they don't see the same information as newer nodes.
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:18:15
How can you argue that SegWit should be deployed first to increase the block size, at the same time as arguing the Bitcoin network doesn't support a block size larger than 1MB. SegWith increases the block size past 1MB!
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:07:43


That's interesting. I know there are some who think it should be a hard fork, and disagree with the witness discount (which doesn't sound at all un-reasonable to me) - so how do you resolve that?


I not sure how you translated the following as "There was no discussion of reducing the activation threshold in the meeting."




Did you mean to say there was no decision made to reduce the threshold?

Thanks for explaining that, I couldn't get my head around how the two changes interacted. I do think the original intention would have been 95% and the variance was just a side effect. I'd be happy to be proven wrong if there is a link to some discussion of it when it was introduced, and they were actually aiming for say 92.67% but decided to get that they would need 95%.
I'd love to see the calculations too, but my understanding of statistics (evidently) isn't up to much either! Perhaps I'll do some research/simulations and see what I can come up with.

Does nlocktime have a max limit? If not it may have been useful to put on in (even if it was 5, or 10 years off) so that eventually we could say with certainty that there are none of those types of transactions hanging around. 
In any case, I think anyone timelocking a transaction more than a year in advance should think very hard about the risks involved.

But the only thing it does is allow them to change their block size, and progmatically help coordinate changes. They could do this anyway by recompiling core (which they do anyway for other reasons) and communicating preferences off chain (which they do anyway for other reasons).
@_date: 2017-03-06 09:45:22


But that would cause bitcoin to not work, which would destroy the value of the fees that are trying to collect. The rational thing to do would be to mine in a way that maximises their revenue while maintaining the value of the network.
Otherwise, why have miners included any transactions at all for the past 6 years? Why not just forget the complexity of selecting, processing and relaying transactions which make their blocks take longer to propagate and mine empty blocks to claim the reward? There will surely be a few 'greedy' miners who don't play nicely, but the premise of bitcoin is that only a majority of miners need to be honest.

Making a $5 purchase where the use pays the fees (with Bitcoin) the user has to decide between paying $6 worth of BTC ($5 + $1 fee) or $5 via Credit Card (where Fiverr suffer the 2% (10 cent) card fee).
At 1$ per tx, that's 20% of a $5 service. Very few people are going to pay that. When fees hit 2$, it will remove the viability of 10$ payments, etc etc.

Or perhaps he just doesn't put censorship resistance above all else. These things aren't binary choices.
If I create a Altcoin where only I can generate coins and can only send them between my own wallets on a private network isolated from the internet, it's incredibly censorship resistant, but utterly useless to everyone else.
Equally, we have PayPal, VISA etc who are very useful to many many people, but easy for governments to control.

@_date: 2017-03-09 11:24:14
Yes, within the consensus of miners the blocks should be large enough so that CPFP isn't relevant, or replace-by-fee to the same extent. Of course overall fees will be less initially when the block size isn't restricted, but that's kind of the point. After a longer period (10s of years) when there a lot more transactions with larger blocks we should be able to gradually replace the diminishing block subsidy entirely with lots of small fees.
As it says in the Whitepaper - "Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free"

No, doubling the block size doubles the throughput.

Ah OK yes, I didn't realize you were referring to SegWit as "~2 MB within a few months".

It sounds like a majority of the miners would prefer a hard fork, so what happens if they don't activate SegWit soft fork (which will require 95% support, right?).

Personally I use multibit hd (multibit.org). Your wallet balance will be denominated in btc, but most wallets also show a live converted rate in USD (or other currency).

Because there is a marginal cost for each additional transaction the miner includes which is the increased risk of their block being orphaned.
Do you think if there was no block size limit, miners would be pumping out GB blocks full of transactions which pay zero fees?
Edit: And yes, as block rewards reduce this becomes less of a problem, and SPV mining also becomes less of a problem.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:02:36
Right, but if you're measuring influence by positive contributions then Blockstream employees do have a large influence :)
So if we reconstruct px403's sentence based on these assumptions, and tone down the language a little, we get: 
"I also think it's bad that they seem to feel that their positive contributions to core allows them to dictate the future of the technology, despite community objections."
Which seems like a reasonable statement.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:22:09
Because the maximum block size an attacker can create is now twice that of the block size using normal transactions. 
Currently: The largest block a malicious miner can make is 1M, and the largest block with typical normal transaction is 1M.
With SegWit and a 1M base block: The largest block a malicious miner can make is 4M, and the largest block with typical normal transaction is ~2M.
SegWit+2M Base: The largest block a malicious miner can make is 8M, and the largest block with typical normal transaction is ~4M.
SegWit+4M = 16M vs. 8M
SegWit+8M = 32M vs. 16M
SegWit+16M = 64M vs. 32M
This means that the base block size can only be 'safely' increased at half the rate it could have been without the SW discount.

@_date: 2016-01-28 12:25:15
If there is enough demand for it, it would happen anyway. 
Someone would create a Bitcoin 22 Million client which raises the limit to 22 million, and everyone who wanted that would start using it.
That is what is happening with the 1MB block size limit. The most popular client doesn't want to raise that limit right now, so other clients are appearing which do. Only time will till tell if there is enough support, but this is the beauty of how Bitcoin works. 
If the idea doesn't have support (which IMO increasing 21M coin limit never will) then the change won't happen, or it will be on a relatively insignificant fork, and no-one will care about it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:45:40
I think you mean transparency, not censorship?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:32:31
No, it's the opposite, if there is less empty space in a block it is much much cheaper for the attack to 'succeed'. 
If blocks were limited to 10MB and there were 1MB of 'non-spam' transactions it would take 9MB of transactions with fees higher than the lowest fee other users are paying to start to push out other users transactions. 
Want to push out someone who's paying 100sat/byte? You'd need 9MB of transactions at 101sat/byte...
With a 1MB block size and 1MB of 'non-spam' transactions, you only need to make a single transaction at 101sat/byte to push out a 100sat/byte transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:54:37
If I'm reading that translation right, they support both SW &amp; Big Blocks, but don't like BU's code and don't like Core devs attitude. I don't see any problem with them not signalling either in this case. They have enough hash power to block SegWit, but not BU.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:02:34
Yes, I too think we can do both. It's just a case of priorities. Hopefully we'll get there one way or another :)
Doing the block size increase first would have avoided the current high-fee/delays situation.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:55:24
Yes, that's very clever, but it actually reduces the block size initially rather than increasing. I wouldn't say that honours the spirit of the agreement.

I ddin't say anything about miners "agree", are you replying to the correct person?
But I do agree - it's not perfect - but there is no perfect solution. This mechanism, IMO, is much much better than saying "well, we cant get everyone to agree so we should keep the limit at 1MB until we can".
Again, I'm not a BU dev, so there may be other things I'm not aware of and these are just my opinions formed from what I've been reading from both sides of the debate over the past few months/years.
Miners 'agreeing' on the rules is how bitcoin works, weather it's the validity of an individual transaction, the result of a SHA256 hash or the maximum block size. Once 50+% percent of miners agree, it's de-faco agreed by the network. As long as 50+% agree on a single EB value, this attack isn't viable. The other BU machanisms such as AD, Sticky Gates or whatever are just there to help easy the transitions since obviously every miner won't switch on exactly the same block height.

Why does Core get to define the sequence? Why not 2mb hard fork, propagation improvements, then SegWit?
If they did that, Classic would have a much smaller following. Classic is simply giving people what they want, and Core are digging in their heels for no good reason.

There is indirectly. The UASF is forcing miners to signal SegWit by saying "if you don't, your otherwise valid blocks will be rejected by the nodes of wallets controlled by the users with the majority of the money"

Common multisig transactions today use P2SH addresses (starting with a 3), which were added as a soft-fork a long time ago. It is possible to do multisig using a technique called Shamir's Secret Sharing on 'normal' addresses (starting with a 1).
Neither of these require SegWit or a Hard Fork and are common today.

I use Multibit as my main wallet, so I'd be forced to upgrade in order to see someone sending a SegWit transaction before it confirms?
It is my understanding that Multibit uses bitcoinj, and bitcoinj's SegWit support is 'WIP'. So for any Multibit (or any bitcoinj based wallet) they would not be able to see incoming SegWit transactions until BitcoinJ has implemented support, and the author of their wallet has updated it to work with the newer version of Bitcoinj. 
Is that what you mean by 'most wallets are ready'?

Why could the terminal not just use it's NFC capabilities to issue a payment request which a mobile bitcoin wallet responds to and sends back the tx id to the terminal, the terminal then listens for the transaction. 
Even better the terminal could be used to broadcast directly the transaction if the mobile wallet has no signal.

For what it's worth, I think your right about the mechanics of it, I just think [Spam]( is the wrong word.
The priority area worked very well, giving higher priority to older coins, but Core set that to 0kb by default in 0.12. Personally I think having the entire block look at coin age as well as fee would be better, and stop all these 0day coins moving back and fourth clogging up the system.
Or, you know, we could just raise the block size limit.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:36:34
I don't think so. SegWit intrucuces new rules which are stricter than the existing rules. If someone mines a block which is valid under the less restrictive old rules, but breaks one of the new SegWith rules, it will be rejected by SegWit nodes but accepted by non-upgraded nodes. 
That's why traditional soft forks have had a 95% activation threshold.

@_date: 2017-03-23 15:57:33
With a fixed max block size (e.g. the current 1MB) the maximum block size an attacking miner could make is the same as the maximum you would typically get from normal transaction. With SegWit the maximum and attacking miner can make becomes roughly double the maxim you would get from normal transactions.
Apparently that's a feature, not a bug.

@_date: 2016-01-05 20:59:17
Well, I'd expect only 'high end' users to be running Bitcoin nodes, most average users would use SPV, or a web wallet.
When you are compounding growth rates there is a huge difference between 17% and 30%.
Even if we take the mid-point of Rusty's 30%, and Neilsen's 50% that's 40% per year.
And what is the growth rate of BIP101? 100% per 2 years - or ~41% per year.
So we have bandwidth growth which can keep up with BIP101, and processing power growth which can more than keep up with BIP101. And that's if no-one make any further optimizations to the protocol - without libsecp256k1, without SegWith, without [improvements to checksig]( without thin blocks, without IBLT, without any development over the next 20 years at all.
It's very clear that anyone arguing that BIP101 is too aggressive, is arguing for creating an artificial fee market, rather than letting one develop organically as the block reward subsides the way that Bitcoin was designed.

It was the smallest size of a set of compromises as a can-kick to ease predicted issues due to impending full blocks. Nobody on the big block side wanted "2mb and that's it" let alone "~2MB once all software has been upgraded and all UTXOs have been sent to new addresses".

That's exactly what allowing miners to configure their own max block sizes does.

I fear this treatment may cause a majority hashrate fork to attack the minority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:01:58
Yes, that is correct and was the usual experience at the time, before blocks were full. Once a transaction had propagated to all miners (a couple of seconds) it could not be replaced by a double spending transaction.
I believe there are now miners who will allow RBF by default, so if you send a double spend transaction even when they already have   conflicting transaction they will accept the highest fee, not the first seen. Also with full blocks and limited sized mempools a transaction may be evicted from the mempool, and can then be double spent even by miners who do usually respect the first-seen-safe rule.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:23:52
I like it, but what is it visualising? Are these transactions entering be mempool, geo-located by IP? Would be good to get some info on hover/click on the map markers as they appear...
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:17:30
It very much was 'planned' to kill the minority fork, it's just it was activated with a threshold of 95%.


So after 95% of miners were mining blocks nVersion=3, and a miner in the 5% who had not upgraded mined a nVersion=2 block (which was previously valid) would have their blocks orphaned by the 95%. 
I'm not saying this was a bad thing, and there are differences, but I'm just making the point that a majority of the hashrate killing blocks from the minority is not unprecedented in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:46:33
I suspect it would. I suspect if a HF had been planned alongside it a year ago to active around now, that would be active too, and the ecosystem would be much better. To quote the top comment on OP's linked thread from a year ago:






@_date: 2017-03-09 15:04:27
Sure, the 1 year was just a arbitrary very far off point in which even the most die-hard 1MB supporter should rationally concede it's dead.
Regarding the difficulty adjustment, it's not quite as quick as you make out (sorry if I've mis-understood you). 
If the split happens half way though an adjustment period, the re-targeting system will still be taking into account the full period (2016 blocks) so they would still have to wait until the difficulty adjustment after that to product blocks at 10 min intervals. If they have 25% hashpower each difficulty period would last 8 weeks due to 40 minute block intervals. If BU do get to 75% hashpower and split, the likelyhood of the minority chain surviving significantly for any period of time is low.
During this time the new chain would have 4x the capacity of the old one, multiplied by whatever the block size increase is, so 8x the capacity if a 2MB blocks are the new consensus limit. People broadcasting transactions to the network will be seeing confirmations on the new chain much quicker than the old one. 
Why do you think the economic nodes would pick the slower chain with less proof of work?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:52:15
If I fire up 10k nodes which accept 2mb blocks, we then have consensus for 2mb, right?

I think part of the problem is that Core is made up of multiple developers with multiple ideas, and 'Core' it's self cannot communicate. For example you get one Dev saying 'blocks are too big, and if anything should be reduced' another saying 'any hard fork is no longer Bitcoin' and a third saying 'yes, of course we intend to increase the block size in the long term'.
You also get official looking communication channels such as the core slack, which some devs claim are not official channels. 
They own bitcoincore.org and yet release binaries and some statements on bitcoin.org, etc.

I'm on my mobile at the moment, but I'll do some calculations tomorrow :)
Edit: Some quick stats based on the past 500 blocks:
* Average Size: 647kB
* Average Size (Excluding 28 Empty (&lt;=2 transactions) Blocks ): 685kB
There are a few clear soft limits in the data, and personally I don't think these should be counted as 'full', but others have asked for it, so:
**Including Empty Blocks**
* Full (&gt;990kb): 82/500 (16.4%)
* Full (240kB - 250kB (Almost all were Discuss Fish)): 37/500 (7.4%)
* Full (740kB - 750kB): 40/500 (8%)
* Total 'Full': 31.8%
**Excluding Empty Blocks**
* Full (&gt;990kb): 82/472 (17.3%)
* Full (240kB - 250kB (Almost all were Discuss Fish)): 37/472 (7.8%)
* Full (740kB - 750kB): 40/472 (8.5%)
* Total 'Full': 33.6%
**tl;dr**: 17.3% of non-empty blocks are full to the current 1MB block size limit. I think its safe to say if these miners could add more transactions they would. 33.6% of blocks are full to the 1MB hard, current 750kB or previous 250kB default soft limit.
5.6% of blocks were empty, which is a fairly good sign that the miner was SPV mining on the previous block headers without validating. Most of these empty blocks cam from AntMiner and KNCminer with a few from Discus Fish and Eligius.

@_date: 2017-03-09 13:11:38
Agreed - but a contributing factor to the reason is makes little sense for lower value payments is increasing fees. I doubt the confirmation delays help user adoption either.
Adoption of a new payment system is of course a chicken and egg problem - merchants like fiverr need to get on board so that user have more places to spend, and more users have to get on board so that merchants have more customers. Increasing fees and transactions delays stall growth.
Fiverr were of course taking a chance by being an early adopting merchant. I'm sure if they saw signs of continued growth in payments via Bitcoin they would have kept it. I'm guessing they saw a decrease and decided it was no longer worth supporting.

With previous soft fork activation, the majority chain attacks the remaining 5% miners by orphaning their valid blocks once the 95% threshold is reached. How is that OK but its not OK with a hard fork upgrade?

What power does BU give to miners that they don't already have? 
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:07:06


Which means 1/2/4 mb + SW
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:07:04
Because although miners could set a soft limit, the max block size was hard coded, so all miners accepted blocks up to 1mb even if they were generating smaller blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-06 09:50:17
I think your definition of Orphan is the one which is commonly used, Luke is however technically correct.
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:52:17
I believe multiple implementations would be better, but whatever happens there will probably always be one which is most common.
Maybe one day we'll have one project which is favored by miners, one by node operators and one (probably SPV) which is used by every day users.
It doesn't require 'trust' in Core, as long as its possible without too much friction for another client to take their place they should act honorably. If they don't, something else takes their place.

It's a good idea. I think the problem would be that it would be open to fraudulent use. Companies who sell Bitcoin and accept card payment want a LOT of verification for their users before the do so.
CC payments are reversible, Bitcoin payments are not, so selling Bitcoin by CC is very risky.
I'd suggest just accepting CCs directly if you can, or directing your users to Coinbase to purchase their Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-01-29 15:56:31


It's a similar, but different problem. 
With SegWit soft fork you need to get all nodes upgraded (a few teams of developers, and ~6000 users) and all wallet/transaction creating software upgraded (hundreds of teams of developers and hundreds of thousands of users).
With a block size increase hardfork you only need to get all Nodes upgraded (a few teams of developers and ~6000 users).
Of course with SegWit the upgrades can be done over a much longer time as its backward compatible, but to get to 1.7MB you need all of them. With the hard fork it has at least 1 month once activated for the nodes to upgrade (longer if they're paying attention, or if a miner doesn't produce a &gt;1mb block asap).

@_date: 2017-03-22 14:55:22
Why? Because it would allow more use cases and more users to transact on chain. Those use cases may include opening and closing channels for LN, or sidechains, or direct p2p transactions on chain. If it is possible to increase capacity as technology allows, the better question is 'why not'?
The problem is that some people think the answer to that questions is 'because people who are invested in developing off-chain solutions have influence over what happens on chain'.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:44:12
To be fair, in both cases it's unlikely to be any kind of Sybil attack. Things are hotting up due to BU's recent gain in hash power, so I suspect supporters of both sides are more inclined to fire up a node, or make it public is it's not currently accepting connections.
Or, perhaps a mining farm, or exchange, or other company have switched from one client to another. There are legitimate uses for running multiple nodes around the globe - it doesn't mean anyone is planning a Sybil attack.

Sorry, I wasn't being sarcastic. I'm genuinely not understanding how you are thinking about this. Perhaps I am overlooking something.


If the block size limit is 1MB and there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker only needs to fill 0.1MB of space with transactions costing 0.04.
If the block size limit is 2MB and there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions, the attacker needs to fill 1.1MB of space with transactions costing 0.04. 
The total cost of the attack being 11x greater for 2MB blocks than 1MB blocks, even though the per-transaction cost is the same. 
In other words - there is 11x the amount of free transaction space in a 2MB block than a 1MB block if there are 0.9MB of legitimate transactions.

No, their road map includes a malleability fix which is what is need to make LN much simplier. This could be done with SegWit or something similar. No reason we can't increase the block size limit AND make off-chain scaling easier. The problem is when the people developing the off-chain solutions want to choke the main chain to make their solutions move viable due to high on-chain fees.

If/when SegWith has support from everything but BU-5% of hashrate, I'd gladly concede that BU supporters are blocking segwit :) At the moment however, they are a long way off blocking SegWit.
Note that the argument can also be reversed when BU has Core-25% of hashrate, which is umm... now! OMG Core is blocking BU!!!
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:08:41

No, the coins you buy from an exchange are not new. They will have been sent to the exchange by another user at some point in the past. If the exchange was smart they would use their oldest coins for paying out first to get the maximum priority.
Coin age priority is based on when the coins were last moved, so sending the same coins multiple times in the same block would not work as well as it does now for an attacker.

It is not about chain length, but about the chain with most proof of work behind it. So even if the classic chain after a few difficulty adjustments became longer, it would not be considered the valid chain by any current clients. Otherwise someone could fork Bitcoin, mine it with a tiny amount of hash power until the difficulty has adjusted and then throw a few petahashes at it and make it longer than the main chain.

If there is a continous stream of people 'willing to pay the most' to get into the next block, and they have RBF, anyone not 'willing to pay the most' will be unable to get in to any block.
For example, the feerate to get into the 'next' block is 200sat/byte. Joe Poorper doesn't need to do that so pays 50sat/byte to get into the 10th block. However after 9 blocks have been mined Joe's 10th block *is now the next block* and there are people willing to pay 200/sat byte, and can kick his transaction out.

The problem is measuring support of the 'economic majority'. While we can get a list of exchanges and ask them, there is a lot of other economic activity happening which isn't so open and accessible. 
It would be interesting to see what percentage of the total bitcoins transferred each exchange is responsible for, but again this would be easy to game by a large holder transferring coins back and fourth. 
If we're going to ask a select bunch of exchanges and well known businesses if they support a flag day activation of a controversial change, we might as well just use Proof of Stake.

Agreed, I think what the article was saying really boils down to 'Miners can carry out a 51% attack'. But I agree, they don't have any incentive to in most cases. For example - increasing the block reward would be veto'd by the rest of the network. Block size however, I'm not so sure - I think most of the network would be happy to go along with it if 51%+ of miners made a reasonable increase. I'm interested to read the followup articles.

@_date: 2016-01-28 17:23:30
I think there were a group of miners involved who wanted 90%. The thing is, all that needs to happen is F2Pool (or another pool with large % of hash power) simply show support for this BIP without actually generating blocks until, say, 70% of the rest of the network is producing them. They they add in their 20% and bam - 90% support.

Fundamental is rather subjective... if users cared strongly about keeping 1mb block size they wouldn't be running SPV clients
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:03:02
I'm not a BU dev, but regarding the 1GB block, BU does parallel validation of new blocks, so that block would be orphaned in favor of a reasonable sized block, nothing would grind to a halt.
Also, AD is now default to 12 (not sure if or how that affects your question). Miners can/do individually change this too, as well as the EB value.
Miners are almost all currently signalling EB1 so if BU gets a majority hash power this attack won't be possible. I expect if it does get a supermajority of hash power they will coordinate to change to 2MB around the same time. That would make this attack very tricky to pull off, exactly at the time everyone is keeping a very close eye on the network. The attack costs ten's if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. How does the attacker profit, taking into account it would tank bitcoins price?
Think of BU of a system which allows people to change a parameter without recompiling, or even restarting, their node, and provides some tools to help smooth the changeover.

With the specific proposal you were referring to (BIP109), it is simply an increase to 2mb.
Since the 1mb limit was introduced we've had 6 years of Moore and Neilsen's laws, as well as the ~3x validation speed improvements via libsecp256k (great work, btw!) and many more optimisations.
At what point would you personally be happy to promote increasing the max block size? If SegWit gets us to ~2mb blocks in a couple of years time, and those blocks are consistently full (with or without second layer solutions such as Lightning), would you be willing to consider increasing max block size?
@_date: 2016-06-07 19:27:37
When you said "I see many benefits in having it external" the "it" you were referring to was "improved relay" - not just the fast block relay protocol. If that is not the case then, giving you the benefit of the doubt, you must have mis-read the question you were responding to.
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:14:09


Nope, I'm arguing the sequence should be:
* 2MB Hark Fork
* Propagation Improvements
* 4MB or 8MB SegWit Hard Fork (without the 0.25x multiplier on SegWit data)

@_date: 2016-06-15 11:50:30


Well, we agree on that :)
The problem is, 3tps is no where near enough to make bitcoin anything but a very niche payment network which is what it is now. It's not enough for large number of on chain transactions, and its not enough for it to be a settlement network. 
I disagree that fees will go to zero. They weren't zero when there was still plenty of block size left. What incentive do miners have to mine zero fee transactions when the block reward has gone? None. So they won't, they'll have minimum fee policies (as they do now, as does the relay code).
We have a choice between a few large fee paying transactions, and lots of low fee paying transactions.

As I understand it, the replay risk is with withdrawls. e.g. 
1) The chain splits.
2) Alice withdraws BTC-C from Exchange X.
3) Alice replays the withdrawal transaction on the BTC-U chain, and gets BTC-U from the exchange without the exchanging knowing about it.
4) Alice withdraws BTC-U from exchange, getting twice as much BTC-U as they should have been allowed.
The safest thing to do for exchanges is to pause withdrawls on both sides of the fork until a winner is decided, or they can taint withdrawls with satoshis from newly minted coins (which is at least 100 blocks in the future)

Luke is saying there that SegWith is an upgrade to Bitcoin not Bitcoin Core, and that Bitcoin does not use a version system. He's not saying that Bitcoin Core does not use a version system, or indeed does not use SemVer. 
Although it is clear they don't *use* SemVer as they don't follow its rules, it's kinda confusing that they'd use the SemVer number formatting e.g X.Y.Z but not follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

@_date: 2016-06-07 16:05:19
Yes, but the text I quoted, from Greg's comments on xthin, was directly opposing having block compression as part of the p2p network, and in favour of having it as a separate protocol.
Now that Core are working on Compact blocks, I'm curious as to weather he still thinks block compression should be part of an external protocol, or if not what has changed his mind?
I'll highlight the specific points he made as arguments against xthin:
* "It is functionality (block latency minimization) that is only interesting to less than 1% of the Bitcoin network. Dumping it all in one protocol increases complexity and attack surface."
* "Running all of the bitcoin p2p over a single protocol creates an unnecessary monoculture; a DOS attack on one protocol could knock out the whole network. The existence of p2p protocol diversity can form parallel paths to communicate the blockchain. In core we've been asking people to create parallel p2p protocols for years. Cramming the functionality into the legacy bitcoin protocol also slaves it's development pace to that of bitcoin client software. By keeping it external it's possible to upgrade the protocol much faster and learn at an accelerated pace."
How do those quotes not also apply to BIP152?
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:55:37

Ah OK, makes sense... 
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:09:42
I agree with you - If Core are following [SemVer]( as their numbering format implies, \*.\*.x releases should be patch releases for backwards compatible bugfixes. SegWit IMO should be a Minor ( \*.x.\* ) release, or even a Major release.
The problem with releasing significant changes as patch versions is that sysadmins and even automated tools will happily apply them without looking too closely at the changelog, assuming they are bugfix releases...

Greg is directly asked:


(emphasis mine)
His response was:


And then listed several benefits of having relay external, and criticisms of having it internal (as quoted above by me), so his answer was clearly a 'no'. Rather than 'yes, it would be great to improve block relay in the protocol, but it would be good to have external protocols too'.

@_date: 2016-06-01 17:59:15
As the block reward decreases and fees increase (through either increased fees per tx, or an increased number of transactions with the same or smaller fees) this should become less of a problem as miners will have a bigger incentive to include more transactions, to the point where it may be more profitable for them to temporarily turn off their miners instead of 'SPV mining'.
@_date: 2016-06-08 15:29:48


Well, here you are trying to doing just that
However, you have for some reason decided to re-write both the question asked and Greg's answer in your own interpretation.
My interpretation is that Greg was asked if he sees "any benefit in incorporating improved relay in the bitcoin protocol, as opposed to an external relay protocol" (in the coxtext of an OP about xthin) and his answer did not include any benefits of doing so. Now that BIP152 comes along, which incorporates improved relay in the bitcoin protocol (I think we both agree on that at least?) the previously highlighted issues are now non-issues. Which to me smells like  - "an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others" ... " or forming part of a wider turf war"
It seems we simply have different interpretations of the text, so I don't think we're going to come to an agreement on this. Sorry for wasting your time.
@_date: 2016-06-01 08:07:08
It seems like collaboration between you guys would be very useful. Perhaps we need some kind of protocol standard (could call is 'storm'?!) to ensure what you are each working on is compatible, and then lightning and thunder and anything else can build their own extensions on the 'storm' protocol ?

I'm not sure I can provide a citation for an opinion...
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:32:54




Isn't it a soft fork? When 95% of miners activate a soft fork any blocks which are not compatible with the soft fork from the remaining 5% are rejected. So it would be a soft fork just with a much lower activation threshold. It would need 50% to work, so it could (rightly, IMO) be described as a 51% attack.
It would be the same if a majority decided to reject blocks which contained transactions containing coins spent to a specific address, and would be a major failure for Bitcoin (IMO).

Yes, but I don't think it was meant to be for settlement only, otherwise why not state that in the whitepaper? There are no mentions of limits to the number of transactions - and you'd think that would be a fairly important point to make if it was the authors intention.

There will be a transaction fee for the seller. They will either directly pass this onto you as a card fee, or will increase the prices of their goods overall in order to cover these fees while still making a profit. In the UK (and maybe its an EU thing) retailers were recently banned from adding credit card fees to payments.
The ideal scenario would be that the seller would provide a discount for paying by BTC since they are getting a direct saving in processing fees. Probably at the moment with low levels of adoption its not worth it for the seller due to the fixed costs associated with accepting/processing crypto payments. But if, say, 25% of their sales were via crypto it may make sense for them to offer a discount.
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:57:42
Honestly, SegWit seems fairly well engineered and tested even if you don't agree with what it's doing. However - if the bug did exist in Core (or any implementation with &gt;50% hastrate) it would be much worse than for a client like BU with only 20% hashrate.

Right, but it's still a valid block with X number of transactions. Any number of transactions you can fit into a SegWit block you also must be able to fit into a non SegWit block. So the poster you replied to is correct that SegWit doesn't increase the number of transactions in the way a simple max block size increase to 2mb would. Of course in the real world SegWit will allow more transactions, but it's not as simple as a 2x increase.

Currently the network isn't congested, so you'll likely get a confirmation very quickly (if you haven't already).
If the sender sent the payment with a very very low fee, or no fee and it doesn't get minded in the next few blocks you can spend the money to another address you own and include a reasonable fee and a miner should pick up both transactions (this is called child-pays-for-parent).

Could a hard fork blocksize increase also specific a max transaction size of 1mb, also not making the problem any worse? 
Isn't any transaction over 100kb currently non-standard? So only a malicious miner could make use of the attack, risking losing a 12.5BTC block reward each time they try it?

The difference is that BTC is running at 100% capacity, so reducing to 70% is a much bigger problem for BTC. You are either disingenuous or incredibly stupid if you don't see the asymmetry in this problem.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:02:16
Maybe the whitepaper?


The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.

Yes, of course this is just my opinion. 
The current governance system is that nobody is in charge. To get a change merged it requires 'consensus' (which isn't actually defined anywhere in this context) - but all it takes is someone with an objection which isn't entirely unreasonable (e.g. 'We cant hard fork because some node operator who hasn't configured alerts or hasn't upgraded for 5 years may not know about it and may lose money). 
There are now many people involved with conflicting visions so any hard fork will be objected to by someone. It's almost inevitable that a fork/altcoin will overtake BTC if this doesn't change. Of course Core isn't the only client, so it could be that everyone switches to another client (e.g. BTC1) and makes the HF change, and then Core do merge it since it's already happened.

Isn't that kind of the plan for BU? Get &gt;50% and then fork to larger blocks... I'm sure they'd want to have significantly more than 50% to make it cleaner, but this accidental &gt;1mb block would have just made the fork happen a little earlier than planned. 
I think once (if) they get &gt;50% - a good portion of the rest of the hashrate will accept larger blocks to to remain in consensus with the majority.

Core's default block size is still 750kb. I tried to get that raised and was met with opposition on the basis that it was already too big.

I originally posted a direct link to the announcement. It was filtered and one of the moderators here confirmed that they filter anything from the BU domain, the filter was working as intended, and they weren't prepared to make an exception for this. To be fair they also suggested I posted it from an alternate site, so I used pastebin. I don't have any involvement with BU, I just thought it was best to provide both sides point of view considering the coverage the bug got on this sub yesterday.
Edit: Also, regarding the testing, I'm fairly sure there are regular BU nodes on 'testnet' which is used by a wide variety of clients, I assume as this was a bug related to unusual coinbase transactions it didn't come up on there. It sounds like they have learned from this mistake and hopefully will improve their testing procedures going forward.

That is clearly wrong, as it [the government] can not just hold them [the bitcoins] when they are in a 2/3 multi-sig vault and the user contains two of the three keys.

I don't think you understand Metcalf's Law (or perhaps it's me that doesn't understand it?!)
The point of adding additional 'nodes' or 'users' or 'fax machines' to the network, is that every existing participant in the network then has an extra person who they can send a fax to (or communicate with, or send bitcoin to). So yes, your grandparents adding another fax machine to the network does increase the value of the network.
If the fax network only has a few people using it, then your grandparents additional fax machine would be 'significant' - but if there are already a hundred million fax machines in the network, it's not 'significant'. Isn't that the entire point of Metcalf's Law?

What if the account of the store that sold the thing is with the same bank? How does the bank give $800 cash back to the store who sold the thing as well as giving $1000 back to you, when they only have your $1000 cash in their vault?
I'm not saying Coinbase do this, but let's say Coinbase held the private keys to 100 BTC, and had 100 customers who have a 1 BTC balance each. Someone comes along and 'buys' 1 BTC from them for $10k. Coinbase update their internal database to say that customer has 1 BTC. They don't need to actually buy the extra BTC to do that. They now have 101 BTC of liabilities but only own 100 BTC. As long as *all* of their customers don't request their real BTC at the same time, it's not a problem - the same as Fractional Reserve Banking.
This would be how their fractional reserve would start, and would mean they could have customers with 22M BTC worth of blanaces, even thought it's not possible for their to be that many BTC in existance.

That's all good if the backlog is static or decreasing, but when it is increasing, you need to use a higher fee. For everyone to get a transaction through everyone needs to use a fee higher than everyone else. Which obviously isn't possible. 
While I'm sure there are many improvements to fee estimation in wallets, ultimately it's a problem of not being able to predict the future. If wallet authors can solve that, I'd be very impressed.

You are correct, but miss the point. Others had been using asicboost before Bitmain applied for their patent, and others have been using the same circuit design as Bitmain have applied for a patent for.

Generally merchants don't get charged for declined attempts. They can't also choose not to validate address or CV2 if they are happy to take the risk.
I would have thought there would be systems in place on the payment gateway to pickup brute forcing, but then perhaps the CV2 is included in a checksum somewhere else on the card, so there may be many less than the 999 combinations. Certainally 6 seconds wouldn't be enought to try nearly 1000 attempts going from user -&gt; merchant -&gt; payment gateway -&gt; card issuer and back.

I assume you would just setup a BCC Node/Wallet and send the coins from your Coinbase Vault to an address generated by that Node/Wallet. I'm not 100% sure so it may be worth checking with Coinbase, or a developer of a client which supports BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:45:41


Again we disagree. I run a node in the UK using spare capacity on existing hardware and spare bandwidth on my existing connection. The cost to me is near zero. If i wanted to run one on dedicated hardware with a dedicated connection it would be about £20/mo. If I wanted to run one in a data center it would be about £10/mo. With more use cases Bitcoin gets more users and more merchants which brings more nodes, meaning more decentralisation and better censorship resistance.
Capping capacity to incentivise development of off chain services isn't the right way to go, IMO.

Sure, but also think that if YouTube thought it was a good idea to charge for videos this way, they would likely use something like Google Wallet for the payment systems, which would also work with multiple websites/platforms (albeit Google controlled).

With both Gold and Bitcoin you need to think about how and where it is stored, and who has access to it and how easy it would be for someone to steal it, and if there are any insurances to cover you if it was stolen.

The full quote (from ViaBTC, not anyone at BU as you imply) which you are twisting out of context is:




There are many use cases where it is beneficial for transactions to be on-chain. There are of course other use cases where they don't need to be, or people would not want them to be traceable.

If I open a channel to a popular merchant who isn't well connected, and fund it, wouldn't the funding I added quickly get dranied, and instead I'd get funding on a different channel, from a customer of that merchant?
Is there a mechanism whereby I can set a channel so that it can only be used by me, or only work in one direction? For example if I setup a channel to Bitflix and I'm watching my favourite movie - I don't want my stream cut off because someone else has depleted my channel funds :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:19:51
I'm running a full node at the moment with pruning set to 3GB. Storage of old transactions is not a problem.
What could be a problem is the record of the unspent transaction outputs - the UTXO set. Gavin wrote a good post on this here - 
We only need to restrain growth to match the exponential growth of the technologies involved in storage/access of the UTXO set.
If a million people buy Coffees for $3 and the coffee chain who sells them then moves their profits to cold storage, that does not increase the UTXO set because the coffee shop has spent the smaller transactions into one single UTXO. 
If 100,000 hedge fund managers distribute a million dollars to their clients, that does increase the UTXO set.
It is not the value of the transactions which matters, but whether they remain unspent.
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:47:12
I'm just thinking aloud really. It seems that any scaling method (be it second layer solutions or raising the block size limit) leads to pressure to reduce nodes. The difference being that increasing the block size limit also increases the number of people running nodes by way of simply having more people able to use Bitcoin directly (and therefore more people who may want the benefit of validating their own transactions).
I'm not against Lightning and second layer solutions, it's just frustrating that the first layer is being restricted to make them more attractive.

If every subscriber to this sub made one bitcoin transaction now, it would take 19.5 hours to clear the backlog *if there were no other people using Bitcoin*.
If every subscriber to this sub made one bitcoin transaction now, and existing usage remained the same, it would take 4 days to clear the backlog.
If every subscriber to this sub made one bitcoin transaction now, the default Core configuration would drop 75% of those transactions from its mempool *if there were no other people using Bitcoin*. Paying higher fees would not help.

@_date: 2016-12-05 17:00:58
Fair enough. Something I've thought about before would be a max block size doubling at every reward halving. The extra block size would allow more fees to make up for the decreased reward, and we'd have 100% increase every 4 years, which is ~19% per annum if I've got my maths correct.
I'd suggest that this should be applied from the 1st halving, so we'd currently be on 4MB blocks, with 8mb at the next halving... SegWit could be re-modelled without the discount otherwise it would give us up to 16MB now blocks and 32MB at the next halving...

@_date: 2016-11-23 20:20:29
Well, by the time we're running blocks with 'legitimate' transactions at 10mb, second layer solutions should be ready for general use, which would hopefully ease the load, and in the mean time users will have a much more positive experience, and attackers won't be able to cripple the network for a few thousand dollars.
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:58:47
With a fixed limit, once usage is greater than capacity there will be spikes in mempool utilisation as the system can no longer clear the backlog of transaction. 
It is literally impossible to predict the fees required to get a transaction included in a future block as that relies on knowledge of... the future.
@_date: 2016-11-23 09:37:15
Section 4 is 2,800 words and covers the entirety of HTLCs. Can you point to a sub-section at least which shows how this can be used in the future without cooperation of the payment hub or receiver for a sender to prove they made the payment?
For example, with Bitcoin on-chain I can simply supply a transaction ID which can be looked up in many public databases or by anyone who syncs a node with the Bitcoin network, and they can see the sender address, receiver address and amount of BTC transferred. With LN what data do I need to provide to show similar proof that I paid X amount of BTC to address Y?
Please don't think I'm arguing that this isn't possible, I'm just trying to learn how :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:54:35


This is where we disagree :) 
The alternate is to scale it through increased block sizes in line with technological growth, software optimisations and second layer solutions when they are ready.

They don't have to 'go down' to update for a Hard Fork any more than they do for a Soft Fork, or in fact any other upgrade to their software. If well managed it simply takes a restart of bitcoind.
The software would simply have logic built in which says:

In the 'How bitcoins are generated and sent' you seem to by implying that miners are not also 'full nodes' - but they are, so the 'full nodes' part is not relevant. For example what would happen if the 'full nodes' throught that the block was not valid? Nothing, unless they were also a miner and a majority of them didn't build on top of it.
Of course if it's the recipients *own* full node, they recipient may decide they don't want to accept them, and try to argue it with the sender :)

But... you can still brute force a checksum to be the characters you want, in the same way you brute force the address to be the characters you want. With enough attempts eventually you can generate an address which has the first and last X characters you are looking for. AFAIK it isn't any more difficult to generate the last X characters than the first.
Let's say I wanted to generate an address ending in C, and for simplicity there are 62 possible characters (upper and lower case aplha, plus digits). With 62 attempts I will on average generate 1 address ending in C. if I wanted to generate an address with two specific characters at the end (e.g. CC) it would take 3844 (62*62) guesses. It takes exponentially more guesses the more characters you want to brute force, regardless of their position in the address.

Why are you limiting the scope of that question to ~~coffee purchases~~ everyday small transactions - does it make sense for *any* transaction to be recorded forever?
All transactions can in fact be pruned from the blockchain, so while it is nice to have some archived copies of all transactions, it's not something that is necessary for all nodes to store.
I see some people have said that the Core roadmap isn't against on chain scaling, which is true. But the current governance system of Core does not allow for ~~increasing the block size~~ allowing more than 1M bytes of transaction data in each block, since that would require a hard fork.
It is also true that the 'Big Blockers' vision for Bitcoin is not against off-chain scaling. Just against preventing on chain scaling to incentivise off-chain scaling.
With regards to conflicts of interest, they exist on both sides. You need to look at the biggest proponents of keeping blocks small, the companies they work for the and the products which will make those companies successful.

What is the source for this figure? If it is the same source as BIP103 and  then it has the same problem, in that it is skewed by the fact that it includes mobile connections which are lower bandwidth. Unless we're aiming for full nodes running on mobiles?
For wired internet connections the growth rate is closer to Neilsen's Law which is 50% per annum.
Since it is much easier (politically) to reduce with a soft-fork if we over-estimate, than increase with a hard fork if we under-estimate, wouldn't it make sense to err on the side of caution and go with something closer to Neilsen's Law?
Also, why stop at 32MB?

I fear it is you who is not following. The receiver (Google, who own YouTube) only receive 1 payment of $20, and pay 1 x 25c fee.
YouTube then store $20 balance in the users account, and decrement that balance in their internal database by, say, 1c for every minute of video they watch - at no cost to themselves.
The point is that the situation is roughly the same if you are sending BTC to Google via LN or Dollars to Google via VISA.

How does Bitcoinj work with them if they are broken?


I don't think i've seen many arguments against Lightning for those reasons. I think the arguments are against restricting the main chain to coerce people to use Lightning. If Lightning does everything that it's claimed to do (which it may well do) it should be a no-brainier for people to start using it, even with much larger blocks on the main chain.

I expect the vast majority of block requests are for more recent blocks. Which AFAIK a pruned node will still serve if it has them. So you could increase the prune limit to say prune=8000 and have a balance between contributing historic blocks and disk space usage. You can also run blocksonly mode if bandwidth is a concern and 0 conf is not.

Neither does LN. You'd have to load LN with $20 or so to make it worthwhile, in the same way you'd load your YouTube account with $20 via VISA and they'd decrement your balance in their database as you watch videos...
The benefit of LN would be that you wouldn't have an account with each provider, you could just have one LN account and hope that the routing works well enough so you can use it with multiple providers.

32mb per 10 minutes. Do you really think the majority of BCH's miners don't have the available bandwidth to relay 32mb of data every 10 minutes?
The only attack vector I can see is if they known of some 0-day quadratic validation bug which would allow them to create a block which takes &gt;10mins to validate. Actually I'm not sure if individual transactions on BCH can be &gt;1M so this may not be an issue either. It will be interesting to see what happens with this attack.

For the first 6 years of Bitcoin the hard limit was way above the usage, so blindly ramping up the (soft) limit was exactly what happened, and it seemed to work out fairly well.
Running against the limit is a change to the economics of the system, and since we can't agree on how/when/if to increase it, I guess we'll just have to see how that works out over the next couple of years.

Will it be possible to prove to a third party that you did make a transaction?
For example with Bitcoin at the moment, if a merchant provides me with a bitcoin address and an amount of BTC to transfer, and I make the transfer I can prove that I did make payment to anyone I need to (e.g. support staff at merchant, a court of law, etc). With LN can they just deny receiving payment?

According to this answer both parties need to be involved to change the BTC fee of the closing transaction - 
So if you receive some funds via LN, and BTC fees go up 10x and your closing transaction doesn't pay a big enough fee to get confirmed... you need to contact the person who sent you the funds to get them to agree to increase the fee, so you can get your BTC out.

I remember trying to make payments during that time. It was very expensive, and e-commerce services would reject payments which didn't arrive in a timely manor, leaving customers having to deal with confused support staff.
You are correct that blocks continued to be mined, and nodes didn't crash (although I do have some memory of nodes crashing due to mempool limits, but that may have been discovered/fixed in advance of the traffic spikes in question).

That's says what their business plan depends on, but not what it actually is. Lightning depends on the survival of bitcoin, so I don't think they're trying to kill it, but it does look like they would benefit from increased fees on the bitcoin blockchain, as it would increase the need for lightning.

It depends on the business and the margins. 3% of gross when your profit margin is 10% can easily be the difference between making a net profit or a net loss. If your margins are 60%, then it's not such a problem.

So how do you store it? 
Encrypt it with a secret? How do you store the secret? 
Encrypt it with a PIN? If someone roots the device they can brute force 10000 pins fairly easily.
Encrypt it with a strong password? Then the user has to enter a strong password every time the want to use their wallet, you might as well just not store the seed and ask them to enter the seed every time they use the wallet.
The point is that the storage on the device should be secure - if that security is breached you are already screwed.

We are talking about Core or XT (or at least I was!). The Double Spend Relay and UTXO querying patches are specific to the XT implementation, and do not have any affect on the consensus rules of the bitcoin network, they are entirely optional.
The only thing XT changes with regards to consensus rules is the Block Size Limit, and only once 75% of the hash power supports making that change.
With regards to the difference between Core and XT, I see Core as the reference implementation, and XT as an E*XT*ended version of Core, with changes (such as the above) which some may consider un-necessary in Core.

It doesn't block specific transactions, it gives lower priority to incoming connections from Tor nodes when all connection slots are full. This was in direct response to DoS attacks via Tor against XT nodes.

Is there currently a limit to the lock times (CLTV or CSV?). If, for example, I wanted to lock away 1BTC for my newborn to spend when they turn 18, could I do that?

@_date: 2015-08-27 16:25:41
No, its reduced from 32MB to 2MB for all non-'block' messages, and 'block' messages are increased to whatever the BIP101 based max block size is at the time.
Edit: Actually, it was reduced in Core to 2MB for all messages, BIP101 increases 'block' messages only to whatever the max block size is. BIP100 I believe specifically keeps the max at 32MB, and I assume will only increase block messages back to 32MB but we will have to see when it's implemented.

Warren Togami (who is an [admin of the mailing list]( and also [employee of blockstream]( may be able to shed some light on how/when satoshi's old email account was added to the list.
It's also possible that: 
- The owner of anonmymousspeech.org (who own vistomail.com) could have sent the message
- Whoever had access to satoshin when it was hacked used it to perform a password recovery on the satoshi account.

But if you weren't giving away 2-3% on credit card fees, you could either a) increase margin, or b) lower prices and increase sales.
The point here is that credit card fees do indeed eat into margins and profits - and losing 2-3% of your turnover is considerable to many businesses, especially those who operate on lower margins. Saying that those who can't afford to lose  2-3% of their turnover (e.g. Wallmart) are 'doing business wrong' is a bit off.

- I believe Bitcoin can scale by increasing the block size limit in line with technological growth, and agree with Gavin's reasoning for BIP101
- I believe Bitcoin Core development is paralyzed due to an undefined 'consensus' required for any pull requests which a loosely defined list of developers object to.
- I believe there is a conflict of interest for some of the Bitcoin Core developers.
- I'm fairly neutral on the other patches included in XT.
- For node operators, switching to XT is the 'safer' option, in that is is backward compatible with Core.

@_date: 2015-08-19 07:49:01


True, but IMO it's using reasonable assumptions. It's not going to be possible to get substantial evidence of something that's going to happen in the future, so we can only estimate. The block size limit is a DOS protection measure so it doesn't need to be highly accurate. *If* BIP101s predictions are wildly off 10 years down the road we can look at it again. BIP101 is much better than sticking at 1mb until everyone is in agreement.


I don't believe it should be up to a select group of 'experts' to make the final decision on this. It seems like they also don't want to be responsible for making a decision on this. BIP101 allows the network to decide on what to do. It's not a perfect voting method, but it's good enough (and it isn't just controlled by miners, as miners aren't going to vote for something which isn't supported by a majority of nodes).


Of course, I don't believe that either, and I'm not sure how you could have inferred that. I said they have a [conflict of interest]( To be clear, I believe they are not working to harm Bitcoin, but are prioritizing development of Sidechains/Lightning (which is perfectly reasonable, as that's what they are being paid to do), and delaying block size limit increases will expedite adoption of the technologies they are being paid to working on. I believe if they didn't have this conflict of interest they would be more willing to compromise and an agreement would eventually be reached.


Clear to who? That's just your opinion. 


Because the patches are fairly trivial and are non-consensus based. I've looked over them and they seem reasonable to me. I must admit I'm not a fan of hard-coding Tor IPs, but Mike isn't either and that should change in future - and it's not a big enough of a concern to stop me running XT of even that specific patch. There is also a bigblocks only version of XT which can be complied if people don't want the other patches. The reason binaries have not been released of that version is that Mike doesn't want to release binaries which identify themselves as Core but are not released by the Core team.


That's a good thing IMO, it should be possible if a large majority of the community, nodes operators and miners disagree with the status-quo that they can change it. I believe that's the way Bitcoin was designed. If someone wanted to, for example, double the block reward and set it to trigger imediatly, or with 51% support, I'm sure that wouldn't have any chance of getting adopted. The same goes for BIP101 - if users, nodes and miners don't want it, it won't get adopted.


In the case of BIP101, I'd say the community is behind it - and if not, it won't activate.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:40:00

Could you expand on which transactions are blocked by XT? AFAIK the only core dev ever to write a patch which blocked specific transacactions was Luke-jr ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:30:49
Have you looked at the patch code? It wasn't to adress any kind of off-by-one error, it was to change a default value. AFAIK all that needs to happen for the S2X fork to activate now is a miner to create a &gt;1M block. If it hadn't been called off, a miner would have done this by now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:14:32
Right, you may not see why, but the evidence suggests people are doing it. 
Where are you getting the transaction amount from? BTC 24h Volume is $3.8B whereas BCH is $2.8B which is 73%
I would suggest that Cash has a bigger following (than LTC) because it is a fork of Bitcoin, and had a developer/community spirit which should make future capacity increases fairly smooth. Bitcoin has ossified it's capacity limits. Some may see that as a benefit to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-27 10:07:12
To be honest, I'm not sure. Those 'peaks' aren't actually that big - 1MB/s at most. I'd assumed it was other peers downloading multiple blocks from this node while syncing, but could be wrong. This node doesn't seem to have any problems keeping up as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:23:11
As blocks are mined on each chain they will create outputs which aren't valid on the other chain, so over time it will solve it's self.

Ah OK. well it may be possible as others have said to receover the 'deleted' files from your hard disk (they are not immediatly wiped when deleted, rather 'marked' as deleted by the filesystem). The problem is that reinstalling windows may have written new data over the top, and scanning for deleted files is a time consuming and tricky process. If it was $3k it may be worth it, but not $30 :)
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:52:38
I don't think there are any technical reasons not to increase the block size limit. The reasons are purely political. 
Of course there is a need for a block size limit but that limit should be far greater than 1MB (IMO).
The arguments against raising it are, from what I can gather, as follows:
- We can't agree on what the new limit should be, and if/how it should be progmatically increased, and without unanimous agreement we should not carry out a hard fork. 
- If we increase the block size limit, it will require more resources from nodes and therefore the number of nodes will reduce, which makes bitcoin more centralised.
- We should artificially constrain the block size limit to encourage a 'fee market' to develop so that miners can be rewarded before the block rewards decrease significantly.
- We should wait until we are averaging over 1MB worth of transactions, and then think about what to do.
- We should never hard fork bitcoin.

As long as you (and only you) have the private keys to your coins before the split, you can't lose either new coin by doing nothing.

Agreed, and I think lightning has lots of potential whoever develops it, but the need for it is greater with a lower block size limit on the bitcoin blockchain.

It's not a doomsday scenario. If there was a issue found with ECDSA which weakened it, then i'd imagine we'd want to move to something more secure asap. The problem would be that if users have coins locked in transactions +1, +5, +10 years out which are dependent on ECDSA, there would be huge resistance to switching to a more secure system.

Infrastructure should be separated from billing/service provision. In the UK BT used to own the infrastructure and provide services, they were broken up into two separate companies and OpenReach (the company who now managed the infrastructure) has to sell access to any company on the same terms, including BT. Other companies can now compete to provide the services. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than the USA seems to be.

I believe it would be possible to implement all relevant BIPS (or at least 100, 101 and 102) into a client, and use version bits to run all three at the same time, and which ever activated first would be the 'winner'. It would make the code much more complicated however, and at the moment the only BIP with any working code is BIP101.

That's... just not true. There is a two week period after activation when miners can't mine &gt;1MB blocks, and after that they can do so at their discretion, which wont happen until there are enough transactions to fill more than 1MB, and then it will probably be like 1.2MB. I doubt we'll see anywhere near an 8MB block for a long time.

They are developing Lighting Networks, which will allow payment between groups of users which are then settled on the bitcoin blockchain. If the block size limit is not increased, fees for 'on chain' transactions will quickly increase as demand outstrips supply, and Lightning Network based transactions will be the cheaper option. If the block size is allowed to grow with demand, or at least with technological improvements, 'on-chain' transactions will remain cheaper for longer, delaying or removing the need for Lighting.

@_date: 2015-08-13 14:23:03
I think that's kind of Mikes point here - Soft Forks are dangerous because the leave the nodes thinking they are fully secure, when they are not fully secure, whereas a hard fork makes it very clear something is wrong, and an upgrade is required.
I guess it would be like saying 'Well, MD5 is known to be broken, but is still fairly secure, so lets keep using that rather than upgrading to SHA256 and making everyone change their software'
@_date: 2015-07-30 11:39:50
That seems like quite a lot of effort to go to for them to get a chance of mining a few extra blocks. 
I don't think many see XT as an attack on the network. 
Many see 1mb+blocks as an attack on the network, but many see them as a way to scale Bitcoin. We'll find out in time which groups vision is correct via a consensus of miners (who are ultimately guided by nodes (who are ultimately guided by users)) - so there isn't really much to be worrying about :)
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:04:04
Mike has just confirmed that the next version of XT (0.11A based on Core 0.11) will support bigger blocks, and I think that means BIP101 or something very similar to that.

I think he's saying that miners might collude to pretend that they are supporting bigger blocks, but not actually supporting it (e.g compiling Bitcoin Core to make it looks like its XT/Supporting bigger blocks, but actually doesn't). So that the first 1mb+ block gets orphaned and there is some confusion before everyone reverts back to the 1mb chain. It's (IMO) a pretty unlikely scenario.

It would be more correct to say 'If BIP101 makes it' - it would be perfectly possible for someone to build a client with BIP101 and none of the other XT patches, and that would continue to work after BIP101 activation.

What would be the incentive to fake it? And if they did, what would be the outcome? My guess would be that the first miner to make a 1mb+ block would have that block rejected by all the miners who were faking it, there would be some confusion but we'd quickly be back to the &lt;1mb blocks chain being the longest chain?

Is that really the consensus? Are you suggesting Gavin, Jeff, Mike and others who clearly feel the network is ready to handle bigger blocks are not Bitcoin Experts, or are you saying that consensus does not require 100% agreement?

Right, there are theoretical ways to scale without a hard fork and without increasing the block size limit, but that's not what you said:

I think most people would prefer that Core implements BIP100 or BIP101. But I also think that if proposals to increase the block size limit are blocked or perpetually delayed by a sub-set of developers and XT offers big blocks via BIP101 then a portion of the node operators will move to XT. 
Then if it's looking like the portion running XT is going to be a majority I think the rest will follow, or Core will give in and implement BIP101. Either way I don't see a future for Bitcoin with 1MB limited blocks.

They're doing it wrong. 
There is no reason they can't create the order on their system first, then make it as paid once bitcoins have been received. That's how they'd work with a card payment, and implementing that with bitcoin is even easier than with a traditional payment gateway.
If they don't have the skills available to integrate bitcoin directly, they can use Coinbase/BitPay which makes it even easier for them.

The hard fork wont activate until 75% of the hashpower supports it, plus a 2 week grace period (afaik) - it will either activate, or it won't.
If it does activate, the risk is then of running code which does not support 1mb+ blocks, as they will be on the minority chain.
The code to do this is being reviewed at the moment (hence this post). I would think that given the controversy of the block size increase, many of the developers on both sides of the debate will be reviewing the code, even if that's only to point out flaws :)

In my defense - when I created that pull request a lot of the hashing power was using the default 750k limit :) 
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:49:59
I may be crazy, but I'm going to take a guess that the statoshi.info node isn't hosted on a home connection in the middle of no-where, so probably could handle an 8x increase in bandwidth. Anyone hosting nodes on their home connections can limit the number of peers they connect to if total bandwidth is a concern. Also worth noting that blocks are currently ~500kb on average, and increasing the block size limit wouldn't immediately change that.
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:55:26
This looks amazing. I have a quick question about these types of transactions. What happens if there is a change in the protocol before the lock time expires? 
For example, if Alice creates a transaction which makes funds unspendable by Bob until the year 2025, but in 2020 a bug is discovered in SHA256 and Bitcoin switches to a different hashing algo. Can Bob still get his coins in 2025, or are they forever lost?

There should be hard cap so a devious miner doesn't generate 100 million valid zero-fee transactions and secretly mine them into a 10gb block then send that to all the other miners, which takes them hours to validate by which time the devious miner has already found the next block ad infinitum.
Edit: Clearly 1MB is currently too conservative for that hard cap, and should be raised IMO... it's just a case of deciding how/when it is raised.

This sounds like the HK agreement... which let's just say didn't work out. 
Some devs just don't want a base block size increase (at least not for several years).
I think it would be better to retry SegWit (once the current BIP9 flag expires in November) without the block size increase via a discount on the signature data. A base blocksize increase can be attempted at the same time, or before, or after...
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:42:42
Can you add a 'non-upgraded wallets are able to validate all consensus rules'?
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:56:57


Yes, that was exactly my point. It is impossible to accurately predict a fee which will get you into the next block, because it isn't possible for everyone to get into the next block, and it is possible for people to make transactions after you, which would bump your transaction out of the block.


It's not just a problem for the next block. If you have capacity for 1000 transactions every 10 minutes, and 2000 people wanting to make a transaction per 10 minutes, 50% of people will **never** get their transactions confirmed.
The model works now because there are periods when demand is less than capacity (overnight etc) but as those decrease, we will end up with permanently high fees pricing out many people and uses cases.

Of course there will always be others that will, but it should be a choice. Again - calling it opt in when only one group of users can opt in does not make sense.

Take a look at the graphs on 
The average block size is increasing month on month, and a "peak times" blocks are consistently just short of 1MB each (excluding the empty blocks due to SPV mining, which also bring down the above average). I assume the 'peak time' window is getting larger. It would be interesting to see a animated average block size by hour of day graph.
The graphs are increasing at a steady rate over a period of months, so if this is an 'attack' the attacker has been building it for months at a huge cost to themselves.

I think you may be confusing me with someone else. My point was that if the scanario the OP posted did play out that way, the lesson would be that Core will always be in control of the protocol and that could never be changed.
Ideally, we'd have a more diverse ranges of clients on the network rather than 90% Core, 10% others that we have at the moment.
If we end up having 90% Classic and 10% others then we aren't really in a better position than where we are now.

Now you're going off on a tangent about Classic.

It has different security, centralisation and price trade offs - or at least I think will do, or might do, if the design was complete, and if it gets implemented, and if enough people use it.
It could work very well to relieve pressure from the main chain, like other layer 2 solutions such as payment channels and centralised processors like coinbase, bitpay and changetip do already. Which would be great.
But, eventually, the block size limit will need to be increased anyway. So why not do it now, in line with technological improvements, to allow other solutions to be developed and adopted organically, and not by force and artificial limitations on the main chain?
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:08:29
So don't call it opt-in if it's only opt-in for one set of users. Miners may also not want to mine double spends for ethical/legal reasons.

@_date: 2016-02-26 09:28:05
I personally believe that the block size should be increased in line with technological growth, to preserve the current level of decentalisation, which is more than adequate for censorship resistance.
There are many improvements which have been made to networking code and to the validation code which makes the requirements, and thus cost, of running a node less than it was say a year ago. There are also many planned improvements and optimisations in the pipeline, and bandwidth, processing and storage costs are all continuing to reduce.
So I agree, Bitcoin should always be a peer to peer currency, but that doesn't mean excessively limiting the maximum block size.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:03:12
I think Coinbase may cover the cost of double-spends/unconfirmed transaction once they have done their risk analysis on them and notified the merchant of the payment.

It's called child pays for parent (CPFP). I believe some pools implement it (Eligus at least - off the top of my head) but it was rejected by Core as doing so 'leaks privacy' (e.g. someone might be able to deduce which was your change ouput and which was the payment).

I'm talking about pruning as per section 7 of the white paper. Pruning AFAIK has only been implemented using a 'simple' method of discarding old blocks, but the method in the whitepaper allows for spent outputs to be fully discarded while maintaining full validation.


transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

Right, but the merchants/processors can profile the risk.
If a tx comes in with zero fee, it's not very likely to confirm so they can decide to ignore it until confirmed. If it comes in with a reasonable fee they can decide the accept the risk of zero conf.
CC charges work the same way. The merchant can decide to accept, or not, transactions with have an non-matching address, or different levels of fraud risk.

I don't do as much open source development as I should, but I am a full time web developer, using Git/Github every day on a number of projects, some of which involve some custom C/C++ applications on the back end.
I don't recall an attack vector in the XT mempool eviction code (which was written by Gavin AFAIK). I actually still believe the random approach was better as it effectively distributed the mempool under adverse conditions, rather than dropping transactions across all mempools. However, it was written under the assumption that mempools would only been full under adverse conditions, whereas Core are working on the assumption that full mempools is the norm. In which case it does make sense to order by fee so that things like IBLT work well as mempools are more in sync even when full.
I think there is a fundamental difference in the mindset or developers who support Core and those who support Classic.

But what we don't know is how many people will send a transaction after you do that will also be competing to get into the next block. 
Everyone who manages to get their transaction into the next block displaces someone else.
If you have 1001 people wanting to make a transaction in the next block, and enough room for 1000 transactions in the block, no amount of fee estimation is going to let everyone get their transaction in. 
With one too many people it's not a big problem, but what if you have 10,000 people wanting to get a transaction into that block? 1000 of those will have to wait at least 10 blocks, by which time another 10,000 people want to make transactions and the first 1000 don't ever get their transaction confirmed.
You then get a 'fee market' which prices out the people who can't afford to compete, and BTC becomes a tool for banks and wealthy individuals.

I don't know about all miners of course, but I know that Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC have publicly stated the are running BU, and don't see any reason to doubt them. They even accidentally mined a &gt;1MB block a while ago, which makes me inclined to believe their public statements.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:53:45
The issue is that someone may have signed a transaction offline, and given it to someone else to spend at a specific date in the future, or may have problematically locked it so that it can only be spent in the future. Fixing malleability would make those kind of transactions invalid.
I think that allowing transactions to be locked far into the future was a mistake.

@_date: 2016-02-23 16:03:26


Well, there can be. This needs to be improved and will be as adoption increases. People are already earning their wages in Bitcoin, and paying for services in Bitcoin.




Contradiction? Also keep in mind 1 bitcoin is ~440 USD, so there will be many many valid users who hold less than 1 bitcoin.


So they are claiming 109,000 transactions are miners moving bitcoins between wallets, and gambling? Seems unlikely. Also why is gambling not considered 'usage'?


This is just pain incorrect. Each transaction has multiple inputs and outputs. The change output is just one output which forms part of each transaction. In fact, a company could pay it's entire staff using one transaction which had one input from their cold wallet and one output for each staff member (within certain limits).
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:59:38

If more users can use Bitcoin, these companies have a larger target market, and more users using their services, and more profit.
If more users can't use Bitcoin, these companies have hit their ceiling and have no further growth, and are currently over-valued.
Gavin, Jeff, Classic etc believe Bitcoin can go mainstream. Core devs (in general) believe it should be a highly secure settlement network.
Of course these companies are in a good position to adapt to using whichever future technologies are developed on top of Core's vision for a settlement network, so it's not too bad for them - but much riskier than continuing their current model.

Ensure that you keep an eye on RBF which may be available later this year - once deployed certain transactions will be replaceable by the user from within their wallet GUI. These transactions will be flagged, so make sure you keep your wallet up to date and keep a look out for replaceable transactions. If someone is intentionally sending you one ask them to wait for 1 confirmation, or to replace it with a non-RBF transaction.

I don't think the arguments against segwit are technical, but more about weather it is the right direction for the protocol to go in. Separating the witness data is i think universally agreed as a good thing, but the way the soft fork has been written, with the convoluted block size increase and size limit replaced with a weight limit is not agreed upon by everybody.
For example, the argument is that doing this helps de-incentivise UTXO increasing transactions, and that transactions which increase the UTXO should be cheaper because the cost to the network of those transactions are higher for all network participants. 
However to counter this, some argue that the UTXO size is an implementation issue and can be solved or the dynamics changed in the long time by using different data structures - for example a spend tree instead of a UTXO (see: 
Should we be changing the protocol today to accommodate implementation details which may change radically with 10, 20 or 50 years more research and software development?
Why not create a soft fork SegWit without the block weight code, and a hard fork block size increase, using separate BIP9 bits so that they can be deployed simultaneously, and activated at different times once there is the require support. If quadratic verification times are an issue (which are incidentally mostly solved by parallel validation) we can cap non-segwit transactions to 1MB without breaking any historic transactions.

It's a tricky one, I agree, but it is not possible to measure economic nodes in a decentralise way which cant be gamed. Measuring mining nodes is very easy (it's really the key problem which Bitcoin solved) so while it's not a perfect measure, it's the best we have. Mining nodes should act in a way that serves the interest of the full nodes.


There is no incentive for them to do so. As you say however, it becomes fuzzy if they mine a coin which some exchanges are willing to list as Bitcoin, then we get a messy battle to find out what the economic majority supports.

Why? Isn't that what SegWit does by replacing Max Block Size with Max Block Weight?
@_date: 2017-04-25 08:22:48
I think the problem would be that a malicious person would only need to mine a single block with an invalid segwit transaction in it, and all the non-segwit miners would start building on that as they would see it as valid (which it would be according to the old consensus rules, but not the new segwit consensus rules)

I don't think that's true at all. My understanding is that everyone listed on the Classic website as supporting classic was asked directly if they support Classic and were OK with their name being used on the site. I'm hoping those statements will be published soon to clear up any confusion/misinformation.
If you are correct, then why has BTCC never been listed on the Classic site as supporting - despite samson stating they support 2mb increase and would be prepared to run a non-Core fork?
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:31:31
Next time try with double the fee. If everyone else looking for a fast confirmation does this, you'll need to keep doubling until you reach &gt;=1.8577300 - at which point the problem is solved as there is no point in sending the payment, and you can allow someone richer than you to take your slot.

Bigger blocks are a scaling strategy. The question is: are they the best and only strategy?
Bigger blocks are vertical scaling. Layer 2 solutions are horizontal scaling. We can do both.
@_date: 2017-04-20 13:30:44
The problem is you can't fix the tx size scaling issues while maintaing support for all the current transactions... you could put a 1MB cap on non-segwit transactions but then you are just back to adding another hard cap. 
What we need to do is get over the fear of hard/soft forks, and look specifically at what each fork changes.

The problem is you are not trying to get into the last block, you are trying to get into the next block. If demand is increasing and everyone uses your logic, they won't all get into the next block. 
Accurately predicting what fee will get you into the next block is an impossible task, and the more accurate fee estimation software becomes, the harder the task becomes.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:25:35
Well I guess we could look at the fees per block, but I don't have easy access to that data. If its transactions making up 0.1BTC worth of transaction fees per block (as a very low estimate), and there are 180 blocks per day (assuming 8 min average), over the past year that's 6570 BTC, or $2.87 million.

The same way the deal with accepting credit card payments, it's a calculated risk and they absorb the cost of failed payments or have insurance to cover it.
Unlike credit cards, if they are willing to wait for one confirmation they have very near 0 risk of failed payment.

Antpool having a large share of the hashrate means that they do have a lot of empty blocks, but that chart shows totals rather than as a percentage of their blocks, which could be more useful. It also shows that from March 2016 they were mining around the same number of empty blocks as other miners - doesn't this imply that the stopped using ASICBoost (if it was the reason for their higher number of empty blocks) a year ago? Why would they do that? It would also be interesting to see data from Sept 16 until now.
Empty blocks are also a sign of SPV mining, could it not be that they had worse connectivity until March 2016, or made an optimisation to their SPV mining technique around that time? 
This empty block 'evidence' seems very weak.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:52:54
Right, there are many contributors to Core. You'll see my name on that list too, somewhere very near the bottom :)
But.. it's still just a single implementation. What if there was a bug in Core which could be exploited to cause all Core nodes to crash? Multiple diverse implementations is a good thing, surely? Btcd for example is great, because it doesn't share code with Core so any bugs are very unlikely to be shared.

So basically replacing only the fee is a privacy concern as it gives away which was the change address. Seems like a reasonable trade off to me.

Miners/pool operators talk to each other. So if a subset of miners want 90% they can simply have one pool operator who manages &gt;15% of the hash rate obstain from voting for 2MB until the rest of the hashrate reaches 74%.

Transactions don't need to be stored for everyone or by every node. We are already seeing some simple pruning techniques and this will only get better. From memory the whitepaper covers pruning. Storage is incredibly cheap, and getting cheaper faster than the block chain is growing.


Not at all (or at least not in my case). The opportunity cost of storing funds on a LN hub are the return on investing the same funds elsewhere. A low risk investment can return 4% PA, and a LN hub is relatively high risk, so operators will probably be looking for &gt;10%. I must admit I've not done any calculations but my gut says people are underestimating the fees hub operators will want to charge, and how complex the decentralised routing algorithm will need to be to calculate the best routes.

You are correct there are many reasons, but network performance is, IMO, a valid reason. 
When they added bitcoin 0-conf transactions were much more reliable, and almost every transaction confirmed in the first block (avg. 10 mins). Fees were also very close to zero. Fees have now increased, and if fees aren't set correctly there is a chance the payment won't go through at all. I imagine this creates a support headache for companies who accept BTC.
Also, when they integrated Bitcoin it had great potential, the expectation was that it would scale and reach wide adoption. That is now looking unlikely without layer 2 solutions. I suspect, as with many companies who integrated Bitcoin payments early on, the cost of the integration was greater than the increased profit from additional sales, or the savings on CC fees for them. They were doing it for idealogical reasons or long-term gains - but it is now becoming clear that these will not happen without additional integration work, if at all.

Over the course of the next 5 years, storage costs per GB will continue to decrease. As long as the blockchain grows slower than the cost to store it increases, there is no 'centralising' factor (in terms of disk storage at least). We also have to look at how network transfer and cpu speeds/costs factor in. But if you look at how all of these have improved over the past 6 years, were in a much better position now than when the 1mb limit was added.

Transactions have confirmations, not addresses.

There have been many improvements to the client software and networking technology, processors and storage technology in the past 6 years - but the block size limit has remained static.

Some nodes operate minimum relay fees, and some miners wont accept zero fee transactions. This combats 'spam' on the the network.

No, there is a network of satellites owned by someone else on which Blockstream rent bandwidth. One claim is much much more impressive than the other.

Perhaps someone could come up with a system whereby the state of the network is tracked in some kind of chain of grouped transactions. Nodes could use their CPU power demonstrate that they have performed a certain amount of work to validate the chain state, and these groups of transactions and then signed with a hash at a target interval (controlled by a difficulty setting on the hash function) say every 10 minutes. It could be called a 'transationgroupchain' or something?

Their analysis seems to be based on the logic that any address beginning with a 3 is a SegWit address. There were many addresses (P2SH) beginning with a 3 before SegWit was ever thought of, so I'm wondering if the same analysis was run before SegWit was even a thing, what percentages of addresses their code would have concluded, incorrectly, where SegWit addresses.
Edit: I believe this may help find the answer: 
OP's link says 44.29% of BTC are in SegWit addresses. What is means is 44.29% of BTC are in P2SH addresses. It also only looks at the top 200 adddresses (who knows why?). Looking at all adddresses we can see that currently 22.3% of BTC are in P2SH Addresses. In July 2017 (before SegWit was activated) 12.5% of BTC were in P2SH addresses. 
So, if (and thats a big if) the only source of new P2SH addreses was new SegWit addresses, **the most amount of BTC in SegWit addresses today is actually 9.8%**.

Fees *are* optional from a protocol point of view. The whitepaper explains that Bitcoin was designed so that the system could transition to being incentivised by fees as the block reward runs out. 


circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
What has actually happened is that the block size was limited and fees have been re-purposed to prioritise transactions because there it not enough capacity to process all transactions.

I think most mining software is clever enough to confirm a chain of transactions if you create a child which has a high enough fee. So if you make a third transaction with a high fee, the miner will confirm the child, parent and grandparent so they they can claim the high fee of the child.

Until the split, the nodes are running the same consensus rules. They validate transactions and blocks in exactly the same way. So yes, these are more nodes run be different people using the same consensus rules. We both agree that is better technically for the network.

That's why I said 'next to zero'. The machine is a VM on a hypervisor which runs other VMs which was on 24/7 anyway. The only direct cost is the additional power cost due to the CPU time of processing a 1mb block every 10 mins and relaying transactions. I suspect that is pennies per month.
I guess there is also the opportunity cost of not using the CPU time, ram and disk space for something profitable?

Each node has its own set of code which determines what it thinks it is valid. The network as a whole comes to consensus using these rules.


Why would that last sentence be present if the rules could never be changed? How was the 1MB limit added if every node must have the same rules? How was the number of DB locks increased if all nodes have to run the same code? What is the point of bitcoin if we have to ensure by some mechanism other than network majority consensus that every node runs the same code for it to work?

Calm down dude. I'm not talking about DNS or other token based uses. I do believe every financial transaction should be able to be on chain for a reasonable price.

This isn't really correct. Some of the original developers who communicated directly with Satoshi (Gavin, Mike etc) are very much big blockers. The current Core developers AFAIK came along mostly after Satoshi left the project.
With regards to scaling the block size being short sighted - if the block size is increased in line with technological growth and software optimizations it would mean no more resources (in dollar terms) were required to run a node in the future than they are today. With increase adoption due to higher capacity the number of nodes would increase and the system would naturally become more decentralised. 
Who is going to want to pay to run a node when the majority of transactions occur off chain? I would argue that moving payments off chain reduces the incentives for miners as they don't get as much in fees, and reduces incentives for users to run as node as the node isn't directly processing their transaction, in fact weakening the security of the 'base layer' which is Bitcoin.

The white paper also says:


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. *Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.*
Previous rule changes introduced via soft forks have used hash power to activate too. Anyone arguing that it can't be don't this way is arguing that the protocol can never be changed, or can only be changed with 100 percent agreement from everyone, which is effectively the same thing.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:42:06
It's not possible. What if there are no pending transactions? Let's say there *was* a rule that say there had to be X transactions in a block. The miner can easily generate X transactions paying themseles 1 satoshi.

I think it's perfectly valid to ask someone what their point is. OP didn't really make a concise point, just a statement and rhetorical question implying there was some issue with Antpool.


I think his point was that they mined the most empty blocks because they mine the most blocks. 
If you look at the number of empty blocks mined as a percentage of the total blocks mined by each pool (2017 YTD) Antpool are actually in 4th place with 1.6%, behind 1hash (6%), HaoBTC (2.2%) and BTC.com (2%). The average across all pools is 1%.

People have the right to object to anything they want to. If coinfreezes were proposed I expect any businesses supporting them would naturally lose their users. 
If the users using the businesses are happy with a block size increase, and those businesses form the vast majority of the economy, then what is the problem?
bitcoin.org putting up banners protesting against the majority of the economy (which includes the users) seems very childish.

I understand it, but I believe their are counter technical arguments. 
The first one that comes to mind is that the network is stronger with more nodes, so keeping more nodes connected for as long as possible while they are all validating transactions and blocks in the same way is a benefit to the network until the point it splits.

The problem occurs when the monied interests in the second layer have large influence over the direction of the first layer, and the direction they claim is best for decentralisation of the first layer also results in the highest fees for the first layer - which in turn drives demand for the products they are developing for the second layer.

Sure, but when S2X activates, there will be two sets of nodes on the network which are out of consensus with each other. What decides which is Bitcoin? 
I would argue that whichever chain has the most cummulative proof of work is the 'real' Bitcoin. You may well argue otherwise. The point is that 'valid' is subjective. Not objective.

All S2X is doing is increasing the block size. It's not trying to steal funds or make arbitrary changes such as creating value out of thin air, so that paragraph holds true. 
The core design does remain in place.
SegWit it's self was a much bigger change, and is now being enforced by a majority of miners and, afaik, nodes.

UASF had only single digit percentage of node support and miner support - if it had activated on the 1st they would have been forked off fairly quickly by an invalid block and been on frozen/minority hashrate chain.

They have Github Organisation account, a .org domain name, 'official' twitter accounts, Slack and IRC channels etc. Ultimately a single person is responsible for weather a commit gets merged or not and a few other individuals opinions carry a lot of weight in any decision making (as you say, because of their previous contributions). Unfortunately a number of other developers who have differing opinions have been driven out.

I also disagree that miners only do things in their own interest. Miners aren't going to mine blocks which are rejected by a majority of non-mining nodes, so the miners are heavily incentivised to remain 'honest' and do what the network wants. As you say, the nodes define the consensus.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:22:27
2M (or actually up to 4M) blocks are only possible with specific transaction types - if the high-fee transactions in the miners mempool are simple transactions without much additional witness data then it makes sense for the miners to make smaller blocks which generate more revenue for them.

The point I (and others in the PR comments - the ones you didn't cherry pick^1 ) are making is that until the consensus rules changes, the BTC1 nodes *are* running the same consensus rules.
By your logic, Core should ban all non-Core implementations, in case they have accidental or intentional consensus changes in future.

I guess you could keep using it for a while. Lots of software currently will periodically check-in with a licensing server so the software could periodically scan the blockchain to make sure you are still the owner of the license. Or it could just check in before updating and not allow updates if not licensed.
I don't think there is a perfect way to do software licensing, but perhaps a blockchain solution could help. A small company could use it instead of running their own licensing servers.
@_date: 2015-09-15 08:17:05


XT is coded so that BIP101 is only activated once there is a super-majority consensus. (Excluding situations where miners can collude to fake that consensus, but I don't believe they have any incentive to do so).

I don't know how you got that from my reply. 
They are configured to hard fork, but until that point they validate each transaction and block using the same rules, so are useful to the network.

But doesn't sorting by fee:
a) take more CPU time on the node
b) remove lower-fee transactions entirely from the whole network, making them un-likely to confirm at all.
Removing at random looks to me like a good way to distribute the mempool across the network at times of extreme usage. Of course it may cause problem with IBLT if that is implemented as mempools wont be as closely synced between nodes.
Someone on the XT dev list came up with a suggestion to pick N transactions at random from the mempool and then drop the lowest fee from those. N could be anything from 1 (current XT behavior) to sizeof(mempool) - allowing nodes operators to choose if they want txs to be dropped at random, by fee, or anywhere in between.

I think downloading is done from multiple peers these days. 
I'm also not sure your method of counting the first 1% and extrapolating from that is a good one, the first 1% of blocks had very few transactions in them, and from my experience syncing is quick up to about 70% and then becomes slower as we get closer to being up to date.
@_date: 2015-09-09 08:40:34
Or make one which pays out if BIP101 passes a threshold. Better still why not just switch to Proof of Stake and be done with it :)
Edit: Not sure if my point is being missed - if we go down the route of compensating miners out of band for voting one way or another, we end up in a situation where whoever has the most coins controls the system - which I don't think is what anyone wants?
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:11:21
Humn yes maybe the link I provided wasn't great. I think way 'callback' is being used here should just be though of as two words - 'call back' - e.g. calling someone via telephone to confirm an instruction which was received via email. 
It does seem strange that a company executive would just transfer a million dollars based on a request in an email. 
There are better places for discussion, but I think you were being down-voted because people were clearly talking about the process of calling someone (by phone) to confirm a large transfer, and you'd confused it with a programming callback function. Maybe that's not a good reason to down vote (and I didn't personally down vote) but I have a feeling that is the reason.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:53:03
Everyone agrees that the block size limit will have to be raised in some way, at some point in the future, right? That will require a hard fork.
If the requirement for the hark for is an absence of objections, it will never happen because there will always be someone who doesn't agree with the method or timing of the raise.
So somehow we have to agree at which point a hardfork is acceptable without 100% consensus. Is 99% OK, 95%?, 75%?
Ultimately, for better or for worse, the current threshold is &gt;50% of the mining power. So if developers can't come to an agreement on how to raise the limit, and it becomes urgent, miners will force the issue and it will be a lot messier than a 75%, 95% or 99% consensus fork.

Is the stress test not deliberatly trying to break the network? Do you think they have considered other options?
If everyone in Greece decided to adopt bitcoin and the network fell over, that would be like the company in the linked case having a 90% off sale and being inundated with emails - of course it wouldn't come under the computer misuse act. 
If a single entity decides to sent a hugh amount of emails, udp packets, http requests or bitcoin transactions, with the intention of causing disruption to servers on the network, than I would hope that does come under the computer misuse act, and the linked case appears to support that.

That's for taking the time to respond in such detail. I was away when I read your response so sorry it's take a while for me to acknowledge it.
I can see the potential of Lightning Networks, but would you agree they only cover a sub-set of the use cases for Bitcoin? They sound almost like a traditional banking system, but without the need for trust, and without the possibility of a fractional reserve (or in fact the opposite of a fractional reserve, where the bank has to hold more reserves than its customers are owed).
Thinking this through a bit more - lets say a Lightning Hub has to have 1 million worth of collateral held to cover the payments it processes. The fee it would have to charge for processing payments would need to at least equal what it could earn from using that collateral elsewhere (earning interest in a traditional bank, investing elsewhere etc) plus the costs of operating the hub? I'm not sure what the figures would be, but does that sound like a reasonable (although very simplified) assumption of how pricing for transactions on the lighting network may be determined?

If you take it to the extreme, and 100% of miners go one way, and 100% of users go the other. The whole system stops.
So you must need some of both. We can see that miner support for NYA is 90%+. We can't measure economic/user support. As long as that is more than 50% I can't foresee any issues with the upgrade, given that large portions of the economic activity are carried out by companies who support NYA.

It would allow the designer to ensure he gets paid before the client downloads the high-res files, and the client to ensure they he gets the high-res files delivered in a timely manor after payment is made.

There is an analysis from Peter Todd here if you are not familiar with the situation:

I can see some use cases for it - for example a graphic designer could send low-res designs to a client, and then use this service to upload and store the high-res versions, which the client could only download upon payment. Kind of like wetransfer.com but with payment. Piracy wouldn't be an interest as the content is unique to the client, and even if it wasn't, the client wouldn't want to distribute it to others as they have just paid for it...

There doesn't appear to be any fixed definition other than greater than a 50% simple majority, but it is commonly 3/5 (60%) or 2/3 (66.6%). I can't find any examples where a supermajority is defined as anything more than 75%.
Edit: If you're talking about the code, it requires 750 out of 1000 blocks to activate, which is 75%. Accounting for variance the worst feasible case is around 68.5% I believe. Someone did some nice research on this recently (with a followup correction).

My reading of that, given that it is in the context of something proposed by the miners, is that the second part of the statement "by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core" is a condition of the first part of the statement "We will run a SegWit release in production".

Mining power of course isn't a perfect measure of consensus, but I think it's the best we can do. The whole point of bitcoin is to find consensus using mining power...
Whats the worst case if support is faked and BIP101 is activated with &lt;50% genuine support? The XT nodes will fork onto a chain with &lt;50% hash power and the non-BIP101 chain will become the longest, and BIP101 will have failed.
Aside from some short term confusion I don't think that's a big problem, and is IMO incredibly unlikely to happen as it would take 25% of the hash power of the network to collude to do it, and they would gain nothing from it. The benefits of a last-resort way of allowing the network to increase the block size limit far outweigh these "what-if" scenarios - IMO.

I was thinking traditional license keys have the same problem, but then that is, somewhat, solved by having central servers track activation of keys based on hardware ids etc. I'm not sure that could be done on the Blockhain, but maybe someone smarter than me could figure a way :) Perhaps if the software could sign a transaction with the private key and include a hash of some uniquely identifying hardware ids in OP_RETURN?
@_date: 2015-09-11 16:09:46
Well, either way is bad so we have to go with the lesser of two evils. With random removal (which could be biased towards lower fees) it's incredibly unlikely a transaction will get removed from all mempools.

Namecheap have over 5 million domains. If they really got hacked by a "highly sophisticated attack against the registrar’s infrastructure" it would be big news, and i'm sure the hackers could find better targets than blockchain.info. 
What I suspect happened is that Namecheap got socially engineered, bc.i had a weak password on their account, someone at bc.i got spear phished, or an employee or ex-employee sold the login info.
If the nameservers are altered, the attacker had full control of everything to do with the domain. Email, APIs, HTTP. They could even request a valid DV SSL certificate use that with a MITM attack. They could also reset passwords for third party services who's contact email is

No, I don't think you understand. Once the softfork has 'activated' (e.g. is being used by 95% of miners) those miners will reject any blocks from miners who are not using it. So with the 1kb example once 95% of miners are only producing 1kb blocks, if a minority miner produced a 2kb block it would be rejected (not built upon) by the rest of the miners. The soft fork rules become the new consensus rules.

What if I disagreed, because I wanted to create a 'fee market'? Or because I thought raising the limit would centralize the network and my preference was for decentralisation over wider adoption?

Oh I see - I'm not sure actually, I thought the P2Pool code would govern or at least validate the blocks being worked on by miners using the pool? I could be wrong.
So if after BIP101 activation (and a valid &gt;1MB block being mined somewhere) a miner in the pool was faking support and hence ignoring the &gt;1MB block, the P2Pool node wouldn't accept shares/blocks from them based on a out of date (based on the BIP101 blockchain) block?

Bitcoin was designed so that the block reward would diminish over time, and as that happens fees would gradually replace it. Keeping the 1MB limit in place (assuming continued adoption) will artificially force fees to increase well before the block reward reduces. 
Why not allow block sizes to increase and then fees to organically take over as the reward reduces? Bigger blocks = more transactions per block = lower fees per transaction for the same amount of compensation per block for the miners. Miners can control the block sizes they are willing to process with the soft limits they can set themselves - they don't need developers to force limits upon them.

Well, Core should shoulder some of the responsibility as their client is run by a significant portion of the network, and the haven't put out a release which attempts to increase the block size limit. Nobody of course is in charge, but some people have significant influence.


I don't buy that. It's like saying terrorism is a good thing because it incentivises people to adapt to it, creating a safer world to live in. While partly true, it would be many times better to avoid the issue in the first place.


So an adaptive block size limit would solve this nicely without kicking the can. Something like Garzick's BIP100, or Unlimited's method, or Flexcap. Instead we have been recommended a hack increase to another constant (how is that not a can-kick?) bundled with a much needed malleability fix.

They only remain in consensus because a soft fork restricts consensus reules, but a hard fork extends consensus rules. Both are still **changes** to consensus rules.
A soft fork could, for example, change the block size limit to 1kB, only allowing a few transactions per block. This would be valid under both old and new consensus rules and hence old nodes would stay 'in consensus' with the new ones.

But valid is subjective. 
To someone running a BCH client, their client sees the BCH chain as the valid chain with the highest accumulated proof of work starting from the Genesis block...
It's also possible to craft a block that ~~SegWit nodes would see as valid, but older nodes would not~~ SegWit nodes would see as invalid, but older nodes would see as valid. If someone did that, which nodes would be following the 'real' Bitcoin chain?
I think the best outcome would be for people to agree that there are multiple definitions for Bitcoin, and multiple viable chains, and work out a way to distinguish them. Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin (BCH), Bitcoin (BTG) etc seems to work well. Over time some will die out and some will win, and common usage of the term 'Bitcoin' will decide which chain it refers to.

You didn't answer the question about ETH/ETC...

My point is that which chain gets to use the Bitcoin name is a social construct. if 99% of Bitcoin users had supported increasing the blocksize via hard fork, that upgraded chain would have kept the Bitcoin name. 
I do agree that BTC should be able to use the Bitcoin name, but don't see the issue with BCH also using the name. We have ticker symbols which are generally undisputed, and suffixes such as Cash/Core which are more controversial but can still be used to distinguish the chains.

I believe there are two limits, a lower limit which acts as you suggest, as well as higher limit which cannot be over-ridden. So node operators could set a lower limit of 1MB and a higher limit of 4MB. If the majority of miners are accepting a chaing with 1.5MB blocks in your node will switch to that chain. If someone pops out a 10MB block you will never switch to that chain.

Why do they all need to be running full nodes? If there are 1% full nodes aren't the other 99% of users (using SPV wallets) effectively delegating that decision to the full nodes they connect to? If the 99% of users were connecting directly to miners it would be a different situation of course.


Even with 10k full nodes... we're in the low single digit percentages at best. More users and use cases could bring more nodes.


Ok so for those with 17Mbps+ upstream bandwidth and 36GB to spare each month, they can connect to 8 people and be happy, for those with less they can reduce the number of peers they connect to and or run blocksonly mode. This will improve further as compact/thin blocks become more widespread and as available bandwidth continues to increase.

Are these basically the blocks mined by Halong miners? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:17:33
Sorry, I think I may have got that the wrong way around. Its possible to create a block that would be invalid to a SegWit node, but valid to a non-segwit node (e.g. Looks like a SegWit block, but breaks the rules of SegWit). Practically that hasn't happened, and if it did it would get orphaned assuming 50+% of miners enforce SegWit rules correctly. But it's the reason that a soft fork requires 50+% hash rate support to activate safely.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:18:46
The protocol can handle the result of the fork when it happens (8MB Block Limit) - It can't handle 8GB blocks which will happen in 20 years, but we have 20 years to fix that.
The comparison is with IPv4. It was designed to work with up to ~4294967296 computers, but of course at the time that was never tested and seemed ludicrous. Today we're running out of IPv4 addresses. 
Had the current Core developers been designing IPv4 they'd have been saying 'Well, we only have 30 computers so lets make the protocol to work with 64 at most since we dont know for sure what will happen with more'.

Ok let's say EOS goes up 10% in an hour. People FOMO and want to buy in to catch a bigger rise. They do that by buying another crpyto via an exchange which is easy to use, lets call it "Basecoin". Basecoin supports three major coins so people buy those, in order to transfer to another exchange which deals with many more alts, with the intent of buying EOS.
Now replace "People" with "Bots" and add in arbitrage across other coins and you see why all coins act almost in unison.
People and Bots then see these other coins increasing and FOMO so the cycle continues.
Until a whale sells - taking a big chunk of the people and bot's money.

Anyone who read the HK agreement. They made it very clear.

Is the timing really that weird? A number of miners agreed with Core developers that they would activate SegWit once the proposed 2MB Hard Fork had been coded (search HK agreement for more info). That HF code has, AFAIK, not been delivered. Interesting times ahead!
EDIT: Relevant bullet points from the agreement.
* This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
* We will run a SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released in a version of Bitcoin Core.
* We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future.

Isn't it that the old version ignore the newer versions blocks? Rather than them ignoring each other? The obvious solution being that the old version users upgrade? 
With a soft-fork, the old versions recognise but do not fully understand the new version blocks, and hence reduce their own security.

Fair enough, if they don't think that's the best path they're not going to follow it, but if bitcoin fails (of course there can be many definitions of failure - losing most of its market share to alts would be one failure mode IMO) they will have to bear some of the responsibility.

Only Core will totally drop low-fee transactions from the mempool. There should be enough alternate clients out there which have different mempool policies to keep the lower fee transactions alive until they eventually get picked up by a miner. Of course we still need bigger blocks so that they get mined in a timely manor, but hopefully that will happen soon one way or another.

SegWit clearly didn't have consensus - this can been seen by the fact it's not been activated - and it's not just Bitmain who don't want to activate it. 


The people who define 'the process' are the same people who claimed SegWit passed the process, and the same people who said other proposals didn't pass it. The people who disagreed were ignored, or outcast.
With a community as large as Bitcoin has become, nothing but the simplest of win-win changes is ever going to get 'consensus'. Anything which involves controversy, trade offs or arbitrary parameters will achieve 'consensus'. The only viable path forward is to attempt changes (be it SegWit or a hard block size increase) with 50% hash power support.

If ViaBTC aren't running BU, how did they accidentally mine a &gt;1M block due to a bug in BU code?

Yes, I think I saw some discussion a while ago of changing the feerate based on the net UTXO set change for the transactions. Perhaps even just increasing the priority of transactions which reduce the UTXO set may help.

Which bit isn't true? The most recent block looks like [this]( - which is mostly hashed data. Using compression such a zip, gzip et wouldn't yield good results. 
Having said that, I was thinking with regards to storage of blocks. So yes, there are ways the blocks can be relayed faster, but it is through things like IBLT, Matt's Fast Relay Network, the work Mike Hearn is doing on 'Thin Blocks' etc and relies on the recipients existing knowledge (mempool, previous blocks etc) rather than simple compression of the block data.
The problem with those ideas, is that they are great while the network is working normally, but if a hypothetical miner produces a valid block full with 100% new transactions they have not yet broadcast to the network they do not help. This opens up 'selfish mining' attacks.
Personally, I don't think the incentives are there for that type of attack to be a problem, but some people are using them to stall increasing the block size. Let's see how fast they change their minds when layer 2 solutions are ready and need bigger blocks.

Yes, BIP100 seems like a good fit. My only issue with it really is that it's hard limited to 32MB blocks, so if we go with BIP100 we get to go through this debate again in a few years time.
BIP101 doesn't have that issue (for 20 years at least) and also doesn't give so much power directly to miners.

Nothing in the protocol forces them to make blocks of a minimum size, only a maximum size. 
They could, if they wanted to, only mine a single transaction per block, or only 10 transactions, or only transactions paying over $100 in fees, or only transactions spending to addresses ending in an 8.

Yes, of course I do. We were talking about miners. Miners create blocks which are validated by nodes. If miners aren't able to create blocks using the previous rules because those blocks are not built upon by other miners, than nodes never get any blocks with the old rules in to validate (or at least if they do they are quickly orphaned).

I think if BIP101 gets activated and the majority of the economy and miners are happily using it the Core developers will hopefully listed to the users and merge it into Core.
Core, XT, the BIP101 implementation etc are all open source, so any competent developer can take over if required. I don't think we'd be short on finding developers to work on the majority fork of Bitcoin, whatever consensus rules it is using.

I disagree. Doing lots of things at once is much less likely to get support from everyone, and therefore more risky. 
We would be better trying something simple which everyone agrees on first, so that we can increase confidence that hard forks can be done without disruption, and then move through the wishlist one by one, or maybe combining related items. This also keeps code changes smaller and easier to review, meaning less chance of bugs and bikeshedding.

 - search for 'timestamp'.
Each node may receive transactions in different orders, so the purpose of them is to come to an agreement on which order they should be in, to prevent double-spends.


It's not that it's being 'allowed' - it's just that its not possible to prevent it. I don't think RBF is a good idea, and do think first-seen-safe is a good policy rule, and it would be nice if all miners used it even if it doesn't maximise their profits - but the problem is that it simply isn't possible to force them to.
If blocks were not full, there would be no need for miners to cheery pick the most profitable transactions, as they would be able to include all transactions. If they did want to discard a transaction, it would be because they thought it was spam, not because they were replacing it with a transaction from someone who could afford a higher fee.

The block contents is mostly random (hashed) data, so doesn't compress well. There are some aspects which could be compressed but this adds complexity and requires additional processing power.

This seems very confused. Schnorr isn't use anywhere in SegWit at the moment, but could be something that SegWit helps enable in the future. 
The traditional 1MB limit is where the transaction data is stored under SegWit, and the witness data is stored separately, in a new space theoretically up to 3MB, but likely to be around 700kB with typical transactions. A SegWith multisig transaction will take exactly the same amount of data on the wire and on disk as it's non-segwit multisig equivalent (although pruning can be more granular with the segwit version in the future, reducing disk space but not data on the wire).

I don't consider "usage increase / popularity" a problem.
You make the assumption that increasing the block size (which you appear to agree will increase the number of users) will reduce the number of node operators. I believe any decrease in the number of node operators because of an increase in resources required to run a node will be more than offset by an increase in number of node operators through an increase in usage and popularity. More users = more businesses processing bitcoin = more nodes.
I don't agree that we should 'fire the miners' and change PoW. If Sha256 was broken, then yes it would need changing. If a single entity gained control of more than 50% of the hashrate then yes, it would need changing (although that probably would just allow the same entity to gain more than 50% of whatever it was changed too, given they would be incredibly well funded).
I think we agree on your last point, but disagree that Bitcoin will become too centralised if the block size is increased.

How can they be overridden by miners?

The point of mining is to determine the order of transactions in a decentralised way. If we could tell which transactions were 'first in' before the block has been mined and accepted by the network, miners wouldn't be needed at all.
@_date: 2015-11-17 21:00:00
Exactly :) the way is framing this makes it so that it would never be possible to increase the blocksize or do any hard fork, because the newer blocks would be invalid. Validity is relative to the nodes own consensus rules, but what is 'valid' to the network as a whole is determined by what 51% of nodes consider valid.

Hence "and is sufficiently buried".
There are probably some use cases where nodes may want to keep the non-witness data (can we call this a semi-pruned node?) but for the majority they might as well discard all data once validated and buried.


But this thread is talking about forcing a UASF which also loses the chance to increase capacity smoothly with a softfork - if the UASF doesn't have majority miner support it will almost certainly lead to a chain split.

The only measure which can be relied upon and measured automonously is blocks in the blockchain. This decentralised consensus mechanism is exactly the problem which Bitcoin sovles, so people suggesting other lesser measures should be used confuses me. Arguing against using hashpower to enforce Bitcoin's rules is arguing against Bitcoin.
Edit: I see there is an 'enable weighting' option on coin.dance... I'm not sure how that works but it produces very different results. Interesting.
Edit 2: Here is an example of a Sybil attack on that poll. Both Blockstream and GreenAddress are Yes for SegWit and No for EC. But they are the same company.

While I mostly agree, there could be a scenario where for example a company thinks an address may be compromised, so they flag it as compromised and issues a new address. Someone may accidentally send coins to it after it is flagged and if they had published the private key anyone could take those coins. I see no benefit of publishing the private key rather than a signing a 'comprised' message.


Sure, that would be possible. You would need someone to setup and manage that infrastructure - and they'd presumably want to generate revenue from that to at least cover costs, if not make a profit. It kind of goes against the 'fully decentralised' nature of Bitcoin, so I suspect you'd have a hard time getting wallet developers to integrate with the service.
The other way I guess would be to extend the Bitcoin protocol to be able to store a 'compromised' flag, but that would require storing extra information on-chain, and possibly open up attacks (e.g. generate a million addresses, mark them all as compromised, so any time anyone wants to spend their coins, their wallet has to check the address they are spending to is not in that list of a million addresses).

@_date: 2017-05-25 15:27:44
Sure, but even so, there were few people mining bitcoin at the time so it's probably not far off the value of the power that went into it. The price will always coverage to the cost of mining because of the difficulty adjustment. If price goes way above the cost of production (as it is now) more miners will enter the scene or existing miners will increase their power, and the difficulty will adjust.

I don't think it would have been inconceivable that an older CPU without thermal protection would have burnt out if it's fan had been disabled. Actually catching fire may be less likely.
If you have a mining farm running many kilowatts of power and every ~10 mins you cut that to ~0 and then back again for a few seconds, it's going to stress a lot of electrical equipment aside from the actual mining chips.
The choice is between not mining any block at all (zero income, zero transactions cleared) and mining and empty block (lots of income, zero transactions cleared). No rational miner would choose to stop mining.
The only 'harm' this does is ever so slightly increase the difficulty at the next adjustment because more blocks were mined.

17Mbps upload and a 36GB/month limit is readily available in many countries. Probably not accessible to 72% of bitcoin users however. (Edit: for example in the UK 86% of homes can get up to 19mbps upload and 76Mbps download for around 25 USD per month). 
Where did you get that 80% figure from? We are no where near that at the moment. With ~5k full nodes online at the moment and ~190k users (looking at the subscribers to this sub, there are probably many more) we are at best 2.6% of users running a full node.
(On a side note, where does the 8 peers number come from, could this not be reduced to 6 or 4 to reduce requirements? What about blocks only mode or compact/thin blocks?) 
You've told me before that ["If you're not running a node, you're not really using Bitcoin."]( - so by your logic; 100% of Bitcoin users are running full nodes :)
The point is, expecting large percentages of users to run a full node is unrealistic. Even if blocks were 100kb, the vast majority of users aren't going to be willing to download and run bitcoind, use any amount of storage, cpu and bandwidth when they can use a SPV-like client which uses less resources.

I'm not sure you can do that, legally - if you've issued a VAT invoice to a customer and then reclaim the VAT I believe that it is the customers money you are reclaiming. When you invoice for VAT you are simple collecting it on behalf of the government. Of course the logistics are tricky, but I think if a customer wanted to reclaim it you would have to provide it, and should make it as easy as possible for customers to reclaim it.
If I'd ordered 10,000 EUR of coins through you last week I'd want my 2,000 EUR in VAT back :)
Edit: Just been looking into this. I'm in the UK so this may not apply but I imagine the rules are similar across the EU. Check out section 9.1 (Unjust Enrichment) - 
It reads to me like as long as you are willing/able to pay back customers you should be OK to claim the full amount and just pay back what is requested. Probably best to talk to your accountant.

What's to say that Bitfury aren't already using it? Their chips/software etc is closed source and not even available to the public (AFAIK). However, it seems that the real-world gains for the technique aren't anywhere near the estimates given by those who 'exposed' covert asicboost estimated.

Ok that makes sense - so the 'peggs' enforce a fixed ratio of bitcoin:liquidcoin?

If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.

Yes, i do, for the same reason they let VISA customers leave the store without waiting for the transaction to be settled. Thy factor chargebacks/doublespends into their costs of business. How many sucessful double spends have there been? How many VISA chargebacks have there been?
If you then look at e-commerce things are much more in Bitcoins favour. Merchants can ship the item, same day (after 10-60 mins) without any worry that they will not receive the funds. With VISA they can be charged back after several days once they have shipped the item. This is a major problem for online merchants which is solved by Bitcoin.

I think what OP really wanted to know is weather the Hard Fork as per BIP109 could cause people to lose timelocked bitcoins.
maaku7 has confirmed Blockstreams 'infamous' timelocked coins wouldn't be affected.
I'd be interested to know if it's theoretically possible. My understanding is that BIP109 limits transactions to use a maximum of ~1.3GB of SHA hashing. 
Is is possible to craft a transaction which would be valid with a 1MB blocksize that uses more than that limit (if that is indeed the limit)?
If it is not possible, then I don't think there is any argument at all to be made. If it is possible, I still don't believe there are any realistic scenarios in which someone would have made such a transaction.
In any case, for the block size limit to be increased at any time in future, even after SegWit, this argument would still be a valid argument against increasing the blocksize limit, wouldn't it? So that makes me think the people using this argument are against ever increasing the max block size, despite suggesting otherwise  in roadmaps, and agreements with miners.

I believe the vision that Unlimited have is that Bitcoin should remain as it was a few years ago, where blocks being full is not the norm, and accepting transactions with no confirmations for small amouts in an acceptable risk for most merchants. I agree with that vision.


The network protocol targets a 10 minute confirmation time, not 15 minutes. Three years ago you could have sent a transaction with the minimum relay fee and had it in the next block (or if your coins were sufficiently aged you could have sent it with a *zero* fee, and had it in the next block). 
Historically hashrate has always been increasing so the actual average confirmation time is closer to 9 minutes I believe. If you are willing to take the small risk of accepting 0 confirmation payments (e.g. you own a coffee shop, and customers are eating-in) payments are near instant.
Finally, increasing the block size does not prevent off chain solutions such as Lightning, in fact it makes them even better. The only thing it does not do is provide financial incentive for people to use them as much (since many smaller uses cases won't need them).

They may be the future of all transactions, but non-SegWit transactions will still be possible, so it would be good to fix the excessive validation bug too.

Really, I think the only thing we disagree with is the severity of the excessive validation bug.
What happens when, even with off chain scaling solutions, we need to increase the number of transactions and hence Max block size on the network? Or do you believe it should be 1mb forever?

But the actual concern is: "Users need to wait for others to upgrade their wallets and produce SegWit transactions, before **the network** can benefit from a significant capacity increase"
This is in contrast to a straight max block size increase, whereby the network would benefit from it immediately (assuming miners choose to create larger blocks, which historically they have when given the opportunity to do so).

I wouldn't advise they use 0 conf in the current climate. A transaction with a low fee could easily get relayed but never end up confirming. We really need to get fees down to make Bitcoin useful again as an in-person payment system.

BIPs 34, 65 and 66 were activated with IsSuperMajority (95% miner activation) and CSV (BIPs 68, 112 and 113) was activated with BIP9 (95% miner activation). SegWit is also being attempted with BIP9.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:09:49
Yes, but whether that's 'right' or not is dependant partly on if he is a current shareholder and the extent of that shareholding.
Say for example I held 20% of Apple's shares, and Apple announced they were going to do something I believed was unethical. I think I'd be justified in calling them on it in public. If I had previously held 20% shares but now held nothing, my musings wouldn't carry much weight.

And for some balance:
@_date: 2015-11-17 22:10:31
I think were basically in agreement here. If I setup a node to reject blocks over 500kb then I'd create a fork of Bitcoin and there would be two Bitcoins. Of course my fork would be irrelevant to everyone else. If 10% joined my fork it would still be irrelevant to most and not the 'valid' fork. Once 51% joins my fork it then becomes the valid fork (although of course the 49% fork still exists) from a network level view. 
Or do you have a different percentage? 75%? 99%? 
@_date: 2016-05-29 10:56:31

Yes, you said Core, but the OP was reporting on the  IRC meeting. I'm genuinely not sure if  is Core-only or general Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:17:30
OK, I think the problem is here that you are simply not understanding the facts. SegWit does fix the validation problem but only for SegWit style transactions. Old style transactions are still valid even after SegWit activates, so the problem still remains as an attacker can still use an old style transaction.
BIP109 fixes the validation attack with a soft fork which is deployed at the same time as the hard fork block size increase.

@_date: 2017-07-18 14:26:41
Yes, and they were right to be - the Core devs are now saying SegWit2X should rename their BIT4 constant from SEGWIT2X to BIP91 :) I suspect this will be used to try and cause enough confusion to prevent the HF.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:07:23
It also provides incentives for people to attack it, and incentives to nodes to not co-operate with each other, if it means they collect more fees for them selves.

@_date: 2017-05-24 14:55:51
Exactly - the argument that the miners are intentionally keeping the blocksize limited so that can make more profit per tx is silly. They would be making more money right now if blocks were bigger.
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:56:27
Couldn't they have exactly the same effect by simply mining smaller blocks? 
Miners have historically increased their soft limits on block size as required by demand. The problem is noe that they have hit the hard limit and cannot continue to do so individually, but have to instead co-ordinate the increase amongst all miners *edit* and nodes */edit*.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:09:36
I guess there are a few variables to consider. What if 60% of the economy and only 20% of the hashpower switch to the new chain? 
Confirmation times on the new chain would be 50 minutes and on the  existing chain the would be 12.5 minutes? Sounds like chaos.
To me it's all moot anyway, as I don't believe the economic majority will be so reckless. !remindme 1st August

Edit: Which ones don't work for you? 
seed.ob1.io, bitcoin.bloqseeds.net and seed.blockchain.info appear to be fully functional and returning random nodes (although I can't work out how you'd determine their sampling method?)
seed.mainnet.b-pay.net does seem to only ever return the same single IP.
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:04:16


I'm not convinced by the assumption that larger blocks means less nodes. I would counter that larger blocks mean more use cases which means more nodes.
**If** a smaller block size means there is a net increase in nodes, it's likely that many of those nodes are hobbyists who send few transactions, and have little economic clout. Allowing larger blocks would increase the number of businesses in the ecosystem and they would be running better connected nodes processing more economic value which would mean a healthier, more decentralised, network overall.
Individuals can still use SPV level security, or with a little expense run a pruned, blocks-only node.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:05:51
Blocks have been full for a while. The problem is some miners want to increase the base block size, some want SegWit, and the rest don't seem to care either way.
As time goes on pressure will increase and a solution will come one way or another. Unfortunately during that time Bitcoin is losing ~~value~~ market share to alts - but perhaps one (or many) of them will be the ultimate solution.
It's very interesting to watch :)
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:30:28
Yes, everyone here is clearly referring to the SegWit UASF... BIP148 - which is coded to Activate on 1st August:


@_date: 2017-07-24 19:33:06

@_date: 2017-05-31 15:28:31
Too little too late it would seem.
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:29:21
Isn't the witness data discounted relative to transaction data?
How does this argument not apply to a straight block size increase to 4MB?
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:45:32
But they can still do covert asicboost by shuffling transactions, even once SegWit is active? Or does something in SegWit prevent it?
@_date: 2017-07-10 10:52:38
Can you look at those numbers from the node operators perspective? 
How much does it cost them to setup (including opening 110 channels) and maintain a node, and how much profit do that make from those fees?
Is it not more likely you'd end up with 100 nodes with 100k users per node?
How much at $35k per BTC does it cost a user to establish 3 channels?

@_date: 2017-05-23 16:02:12
That's just not true. Miners receive income from transaction fees as well as from the block reward. There has always been the concept of fees, and the intention has always been to transition from Reward Subsidy to fees. You do not have to have unlimited supply to do that. In 100+ years when the subsidy stops, we could have blocks of hundreds of megabytes containing hundreds of thousands of transactions all paying a small fee each. It's all in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:44:27
The wording is very weak - "our intention" ... "But we know that it is possible for pledges to be insufficient for certainty even though we intend them to be."
The concern is that blockstream build a large portfolio of patents which are used in core and other clients and then go bust for whatever reason. Then someone purchases those patents from the administrators and starts enforcing them.

A HF can provide some relief to the network congestion at peak time while the cool shit segwit enables is being developed, tested, delpoyed and adopted over the coming years.

@_date: 2016-07-25 09:55:59
I don't think that's likely. There will always be economies of scale with mining, and a small number of locations with cheap electricity.
Even if that means miners make less money, the mining industry shrinking and difficulty reduces, I suspect it will remain fairly centralised.

It's both. Some people like to call it one or the other since it makes them think 'their team' won.

@_date: 2017-07-11 13:57:51
A DoS attack wouldn't adjust the difficulty, so wouldn't make mining any easier for the attacker. Generating 6000 blocks in one day on main net would require 41x the current hashrate. 
If an attacker can gain 41x the current hashrate, they can do much more fun things then delay SegWit2X activation by a day.
(but yes, my 256 characters example was a random guess, I haven't done the calculations.... both scenarios are so improbable I wouldn't begrudge someone for describing them as impossible).

The design of FIBRE is such that the optimal usage is when it's centralised, which is why Matt's network is the one the majority of miners use.
The critical factor is the time is takes to get the block distributed to all miners. This is of course highly dependent on latency, but also dependent on bandwidth. Having 16ms latency with zero round trips is great, but if you have to transfer megabtyes of data at moderate speeds, you could well end up getting the block distributed to all miners faster with say 40ms latency, 1.5 round trip and 1kb of data, could you not?

Please stop assuming a contentions soft fork will have a majority economic support. 
If all else is equal, there is close to zero chance of a 75% hash power supported chain being reorged by the minority chain. Even with a small majority of economic support, a 75% chain would win. 75BTC would be produced on the majority chain for every 25BTC on the minority. Transactions would take 3x longer on the minority chain, fees would be much higher on the minority chain - and all this is assuming the majority of miners are kind enough not to attack the minority (which some have stated they will be doing).

FIBRE is relatively centralised though, isn't it? Aren't we aiming for decentralisation?
With regards to the bandwidth savings of block propagation schemes such as Graphene, although as you say they only cover a small portion of total bandwidth usage for a node, the bandwidth they save is bandwidth used for block propagation - a critical factor for decentralisation of mining.

I'm fairly sure with BIP70 wallets can allow the user to override the suggested fee. The problem for BitPay was, I believe, that without a suggested fee and with rapidly fluctuating fees due to a congested network users were using their wallets default fees, which were out dated and payment were not confirming in a timely manor. 
I do agree there should be a way for 'advanced' users to view the raw address on the payment dialogue if they are confident they can sent the correct total and sufficient fees.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:40:57

The reasons for BitPay requiring BIP70 are explained in their blog post here -  and their FAQ here - 
tl;dr - A congested BTC network causes huge problems for payments, and BIP70 mostly solves this.
Perhaps you could ask your web wallet provider to adopt BIP70? It's 5 years old now...

Which leads to a very poor user experience. As is evidenced by the current fee market.

Your second point contradicts your first? You are correct that at activation there would be 25% not-upgraded, but those non-upgraded had 28 days to upgrade, so there would not be a guaranteed 25%.
Also, as your third point states, it was not enforced to create a 1mb+ block upon activation... so longer could have been given for the remaining miners to upgraded, if there was a legitimate reason for them to need more than 28 days to change one line of code.

The more work a majority chain does, the harder it gets for a minority chain to catch up - see Section 11 of the whitepaper (which I belive the calculations are actually slightly off, be the point remains). Once a 75% chain was ahead for a few days it would be near impossible for the majority to overtake. Doesn't the same thing happen every time there is a orphaned block - where is the wipeout protection for that?

@_date: 2016-07-06 09:15:30
Well, [this quote]( from the designer of Bitcoin suggests it:


@_date: 2019-05-01 08:35:32
I didn't mention the term Cash, I was refering to the introduction (Section 1) of the Whitepaper. It reads:
\&gt; Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.
\&gt; What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.
The first paragraph outlines the problem Bitcoin is intended to solve. It mentions merchants, their customers, and removing trusted parties which facilitate the transactions between them. It also mentions minimum transaction sizes due to the costs of the third parties involved.
Do you honestly read that and believe that Bitcoin wasn't at least partly intended to replace trusted financial middle-men such as Visa, PayPal etc - and that it wasn't intended to be cheaper than those existing systems?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:36:49
No, I mean like TCP/IP took over from IPX/SPX, NetBUI and AppleTalk. 
Do you think TCP/IP is perfect and will never be replaced by something better?
What about HTTP? We have HTTP/1.0 HTTP/1.1 and now HTTP/2
HTML? We've had several version of that intertwined with XHTML. 
No protocol is perfect - it's naive to think that network effect alone can maintain a protocol's dominance.

Ok, it does seem I'm not understanding what you mean by asymmetric advantage...
Are you saying that a chain with miniroty hashpower support and miniroty economic support could beat a chain with majority hashpower and majority economic support? If so, that sounds like a huge flaw in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:54:56
Thanks for being reasonable about it :) 
For reference I'm running a node which would be capable of processing 16mb blocks in the UK (assuming a 1mb per tx limit, or other quadratic validation fix) and it's on spare capacity on a machine which cost a few hundred dollars equivalent to purchase and my 80mb/20mb internet connection costs around $30 per month with no cap.

@_date: 2017-06-02 16:08:49
Right I understand why we disagree now... so can you explain why you think a minority chain with minority miner support can win?
What levels are we talking here? Would 10% hashpower/economic support be ok, or does it need more like 40%?
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:39:23
Fees will ultimately make up the reward for miners once the subsidy reduces to zero. From the whitepaper:


circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
To get enough fees to equal the original 50BTC per block reward we could either keep blocks at 1MB and have fees of 0.03125 BTC per transaction (~20USD) or we could have larger blocks with more transactions and lower fees per transaction. 
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:41:57
The subsidy will round down to 0 in ~2140 yes, but by 2032 it will be &lt; 1BTC - so it is worth thinking about now.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:39:50
Agreed, and that risk was taken into consideration when the 75%/28 day activation period was decided. 
I remember at the time the same people who are now arguing for UASF with &gt;0% miner support were saying Classic should have 95% activation... the [response from Gavin]( was that we can't be held hostage by a single miner who wants to Veto a change. How right he was.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:46:36
I almost feel sorry for Luke, he's just a pawn :(
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:05:56


 - excellent example! It's taking time, but the rate of adoption is increasing, so it shouldn't be too much longer until it's dominant - Belgium is at 49% and USA at 35%.
Agreed on HTTP and HTML, the transitions are messy and somewhat influenced by Google in the case of HTTP - but they are still an improvement on the old. Protocols need to adapt, and if the don't they get supplanted. 


I'm not pumping anything (if that was aimed at me!). I'm trying to make the point that Bitcoin needs to adapt, which includes increasing the base block size limit, or it will be supplanted.

Ok, so I guess the advice is generally to combine any UTXOs during off-peak times if you want to spend them together at peak times. 
I suppose an automated system (exchange etc) could be setup to monitor the blockchain and tidy things up during low demand. If enough people did this demand would become less spikey.
But... isn't this just bloating the blockchain with unnecessary transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:40:18
