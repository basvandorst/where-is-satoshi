If he had no class, he'd be on T_D

You don't argue with stupid

Oh look, it's deranged
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:04:26
Uhh so he's bashing slaves for being too focused on slavery while they were slaves. Black people just got voting rights in the 1950s... I see what he's trying to say but he went way too far.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:34:12
Still pointless

Idk or care who Scott Adams is. Maybe you just like him because he's sucking up to Trump.

You're still failing to explain why he feels the need to complain about a slave mentality during the years when they were actually slaves. You aren't Kanye's spokesman, I'm gunna go with what he actually said and not your interpretation of it. He complained that we've been focused on slavery these last 400 years. That's bullshit. Nothing more to it.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:39:23
Ok? Does that somehow validate what he said about slavery? In my opinion, your opinion on racial issues is completely invalidated if you think slavery is a choice.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:44:20






Yeah, he's including slaves in his complaint about people thinking about slavery too much. That's the point, he went to far. I didn't ignore anything, you just reaffirmed my point.


Lol then you're a fool. Kanye's always been about himself and publicity. He's a classic narcissist which is why he likes Trump. Guy that has mental breakdown on stage likes Trump... shocking.


He's very obviously talking about the slave mentality persisting to this day. It's why he said 400 years and not 250.
250 wouldn't make any sense. Slave mentality has persisted to this day, but blaming slaves for feeling like slaves is fucking stupid. That's what you don't understand. Kanye doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. He's a privileged asshole that's trying to generate attention to himself. This is par for the course for narcissists like Kanye and Trump. 
I'm not talking about people liking or not liking Kanye. I'm talking about hypocrite Trump supporters that are praising Kanye for his dumbass comments while previously telling black athletes to shut up and play with a ball. Do you know what hypocrisy means?
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:33:26
You're making an interpretation that isn't consistent with his words. He said "when you hear about slavery for 400 years?" He's literally lamenting the fact that we heard about slavery for 400 years as if enslaved black people were supposed to think about something else.
Also, blacks were harshly discriminated against for at least another 100 years after slavery. They didn't have voting rights until the '50s.
Honestly, if he said 40 years there wouldn't be much controversy. Like I said, he went way too far. He's just a privileged asshole looking to generate publicity for his new album. You think the timing with all these controversial comments is coincidence? 
Also hilarious to see Trump supporters defend Kanye but when it's a black athlete they should definitely shut up and stay out of politics. Hypocrites.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:12:59
Again, why the fuck are the years WHEN THEY WERE LITERALLY SLAVES included in this? Why wouldn't he say the last 150 years? Or the 60 years since they got voting rights? That's the "too far" part that you really haven't explained at all
I mean, the why is obvious. It's because Kanye wants attention.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:51:08
Easy to correct yourself after all the negative backlash. Doesn't change what he originally said.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:54:59


Then he would have said 150 years, not 400. Thanks for proving my point.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:12:21
He said 400 years of hearing about slavery? What the fuck are you talking about? He's complaining that black people have been complaining about slavery for 400 years, not just present day.. did you even read what you copy/pasted?
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:39:36
You could be lying or interpreting it however you want it. How the fuck would I know
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:25:39
Who wasn't there? Black people? Uhh yeah they were..
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:41:38
You don't have a point
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:06:54
Ok, then again, why the fuck bring up the last 400 years if we're only talking about people alive today? We're talking in circles and you don't seem to be getting it 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:43:24


Eh not really. This is muddying the waters of what a slave actually is.
