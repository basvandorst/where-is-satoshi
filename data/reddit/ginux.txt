think about the power consumption of traditional banking industrial, their IT infrastructure, servers, access control and security protection, surveillance systems, branch offices, hiring employees, compare with that, mining is more economical and environmentally friendly

西奥 B. 奇诺 for Simplified Chinese is better, and for Traditional Chinese, 西奧 B. 奇諾 is the same. 
but 千野 is obviously a Japanese name with Kanji Character, it has the alike shape as Chinese Characters, but totally different pronunciation and meaning

In fact altcoins pump more when BTC pump, and dump more when BTC dump. It's quite easy to understand because the market capitalisation of one single altcoin is small and the price is easy to manipulate.
Most of the altcoins created for scam purpose, after gaining inflated value, the scammer converts their profit into fiat or Bitcoin, then drops off the altcoin, so the price of this scam coin goes to zero.
But, as the scam will continue to repeat, the new scam coin continues to be created, the individual altcoin will return to zero, but in general, there will always be altcoins on the market.
However, there are some altcoins that are innovative and improved, those altcoins have the potential to exist for a long time with Bitcoin, to promote and integrate each other.
When the profits of all scams runs into Bitcoin, when the cheated victim realize the value of Bitcoin, capital will flow into Bitcoin, at this time, the Bitcoin bull market will really open, along with those innovative altcoins together.

Historically, Japanese character followed the ancient Chinese characters used in ancient China about 2200 years ago, and then developed alone, only about 3,800 characters left in modern Japanese, which are similar in shape to Chinese characters, called Kanji, at the meanwhile there are about 90,000 Chinese characters in modern Chinese, that makes a huge difference.
In China, Japan and Korea, people put their family name (surname / last name) in front, their names are in the back, both spoken and written.
But when they use Roman characters to express the pronunciation of their names, the order will reverse.
For example, Japanese name 中本 聡(Satoshi Nakamoto), the family name is 中本(Nakamoto), and the name is 聡(Satoshi), if he comes to China, his name becomes 中本 聪 because 聡 is a Kanji character not used in China, but the Roman spelling is still Satoshi Nakamoto. The names of Chinese are exactly the same, so the order of names does not cause any confusion at all.

The rise of the Internet has enabled INFORMATION to be transferred freely and efficiently on a global scale, while Bitcoin has enabled the border-less and efficient transfer of VALUE.
Do you have any idea of the difference between spreading INFORMATION and transferring VALUE?
