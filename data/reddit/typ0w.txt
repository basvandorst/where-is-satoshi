Partially. With the recent squeezes of exchanges and their bad decisions bitcoin may slowly become harder to aquire for new people from direct bank transfer but this opens an opportunity for p2p bitcoin transatiins to thrive which was always the eventual direction of a decentralized marketplace. Someone will step in and fill the gap if accepting cash for btc and if coinbase sucks let them fall out with the old to make room for the new.

It would be more beneficial to think of credibility in % instead of binary. Every news organization I'd rate from 20% credible up towards 80% credible. This line of thinking frees us up to consider sources. I e good example is VICE. On mobile, but they have two branches of media generation that have wide ranges of credibility. One of them has amazing content on hands on investigative joirnalism. The other I'd say is more sketchy then your average fox news. I'd even say that for     the BBC I take some articles they write at worse then fox but most at much much better. 
If in wasn't on mobile I'd like to find a like to an article to link as soirce that explained goals and inner workings of modern propaganda I read within the last week. A key point takeaway was a goal in modern proper andante is to create general distrust of all msm to such an extent that the population falls into easily servable bubbles. This allows for our general advertising technology to be used to custom targeting population groups and measurably control the flow of information. As I work in designing these systems in an advertising agency this hit home with me as a strategy...
Excuse the rant, too much morning coffee. 
Fox news still sucks, but Id be careful of discounting every word before reading.

To be fair, his extremist view is at the very core of the cypherpunk community that is the reason bitcoin was created in the first place. 
I think it's good to acknowledge this root to see two different community goals. 
Goal 1 is adoption at any cost. The widespread adoption helps consumer confidence leading to btc to the moon and thus everyone makes money on their coins. 
This has become the general community view over the last few years as I've seen.
This taps into the dev controversy and scandals to keep bitcoin tech limited to scale so that these third parties including visa and banks would have to run on top or along side of the btc tech in a race to grab the market share and slow down actual bitcoin devolopment  so that they can catchup
I've also noted the bitcoin dev community branching for various technical but mostly political reasons. (bitcoin classic. Bitcoin core, bitcoin xt) this seemed from my pov to support a dev direction to make bitcoin itself ultimately infinity scale able and tackle the technological challenges around that (size of blockchain, transaction conjestion) without needing the third parties. I'd call this goal 2.
Also good to note here that if any of these forks continue to evolve they could likely become the first serious altcoins. Unlike lite coin which was mostly just a direct copy of btc with a different encryption algorithm and a few different settings these dev directions have a potential to seriously fork btc into seperate coins with different and incompatible devolopment philosophies. 
I'd argue the former G1 is best for quick adoption and there is a fair case here that bitcoin growth could be stunted by driving traffic to quick adoption through third parties instead of evolving bitcoin itself. In theory this could push bitcoin into a 4-ever-backend tech.
 By contrast the latter G2's focus on ensuring the bitcoin platform itself is what can scale infinate and be directly accepted is best for long term growth and stability and directly in line with the core values of its original creators and extremists like Important to note that by rejecting third party integrations  devolopment and innovation will within the platform itself which adds more direct value to the cryptocurrency and less to the third parties around it.  (Ie. Everyone's coins are more valuable instead of creating a third party company of value with features outside of the coin)
An offhand example would be if paypal accepted bitcoin tomorrow, everyone could spend bitcoin everywhere.. but paypal dictates the fees while simotaniously raising the bar for entry for new tech and small buisnesses to push for direct btc integration.
In contrast here if a site like amazon accepted btc directly, this is much more healthy to the btc economy as a whole and to its long term value.
so i agree with the philosophy of even if his combative troll like tone is counterproductive to his cause.
In reality over the next few years we will see multiple directions for crypto implimentation and over time I hope the best one will win.

Read the FAQ to the right of your post.
"How to buy bitcoins"
Then read other FAQ links to inform yourself.
You have three options, one of which you're askign about.
1) Debit/credit card. These sites are less common because Bitcoins are anonymous people steal credit card info, but Bitcoins, the real owner of the cards issues a chargeback, theif keeps Bitcoins, middle site loses. This being said, these sites still exist and are linked to in the above link. I'd recommend considering all of your options.
2) BitInstant. Using this site you can get bitcoins the fastst by using money orders. THis has the highest fees for conversiont hough due to its instant convenience.
3) Use checking account. Coinbase is popular and has the lowest fees. Will take a few business days to process but is totally worth it in my opinion.

massive inflation of the dollar means that all the dollars in circulation are worth massivly less.
Think of how 10 years ago gas was 99 cents a gallon. Now its arount 5$ due to how the inflation of the dollar is traded against barrels of oil.
In the event of massive inflation of the dollar A similar thing would happen to bitcoin to where it would take a lot of inflated dollars to buy a bitcoin, and a bitcoin would buy many more dollars.

You need more data points within Google's window to draw conclusions.
To elaborate if Google has strong data from oct-2010 to oct-2012 then instead of 24 monthly data points you should use the 730 days, or the 17,520 hours ect. Its a common theme in data science that the higher your level of aggregation the harder it is to draw conclusions versus the more detailed it is the more data you have to analyze and correlate.
I work a lot with data mining and product development that utilizes large datasets in my day job to give tools to data scientists and am actually constructing a large database and collection scripts at home with very granular data for my own BTC projects. Feel free to Pm me if you have questions or are interested in what i'll be including in my dataset. Always willing to hear other people's ideas on what metrics I should mien and collect for analysis to add them to my projects scope ate the ground floor. Also always willing to share data once collected.

I meet people online, and I meet people IRL. 
I appreciate and understand the linguistic need fo distinction.
For example 


This implies that while it was the first time meeting a bitcoiner in person, he has met and may be friends with peole digitally who he can discuss with.
versus 


This statement implies that it is, overall, his first interaction with someone who knows about BTC.

Essentially it wasn't a 51% double spend and has more to do with the block-chain fork that happened earlier this week.
Information about the blockchain fork can be found here:
It is known that during the rare instance of a fork, this is possible and most reputable exchanges and merchants shut down while the devs resolved within a few short hours.
Its important to remember that we are still in the early stages of bitcoin AND that the entire situation was resolved quickly. Ideally ti also exposed areas of the code that can be improved on to make the system even stronger.

Your visualization is a bit off as explained below.
Imagine that each bitcoin starts off as worth $1
there are 10 million bitcoins
99% of the bitcoins disappeared (now one million left)
Now we can visualize that the remaining 1% of them would still need to be used by 100% of the people who need them for the economy so in response to the low supply and 99x demand. we could imagine that the remaining one million that was worth 10 million before the event, is now worth 10 million after the event.
What you cant say is that, 'well wont the person who bought 99% of the BTCs now own 990 million dollars worth instead of 99 mil just through purchasing.?' The answe to this is, partially yes, but its a bit more complicated 
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:23:43
this is the golden question.
the answer is that there are two reputable vendors backlogged form all of the demand.
and lots of ireputable scammers.

Not difficult to acquire. See the FAQ to the right.
Yes, early adoptors who bought BTCs have a high reward, the same way that people who buy a stock early before it rises are rewarded.
BTC is 3/4ths currency, 1/4th investment where the value of the investment is justified under the assumption of rising demand. This is fueled by 
A) more people using BTCs to buy things
B) more people wanting to 'invest' and save
C) more buisnesses wanting to tap into economy
As more users join the price to go up, and reinforces B and spreads publicity.
Publicity from rising prices attracts A users
the more A users there are the more C users enter wanting to get a piece of the economy. C users also directly promote and attract A users.
Volatility is mostly from speculators on the investment side, its the economy part of bitcoin that gives it its massive potential for growth and stability. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:31:34
Because other exchanges have 1% fees, or 0% fees to buy BTC.
You should consider researching and trying out a few others if possible when you buy any in the future.

Right now it is hard to get the hardware no matter how much money he has.
I wouldn't invest unless he has a direct plan with how to acquire ASIC rigs directly.
Sadly only there are 2 manufacturers who are shipping them and they are backlogged so far it would be highly questionable if they would be profitable.
To beware: many fake manufacturers of ASIC rigs have popped up and taken lots of money and disappeared.
This behavior is to be expected when people can buy 'magic computer parts that pay for themselves and print money'
In my opinion, it's safer to just invest in bitcoin itself at a long position.
@_date: 2013-03-15 19:11:42

Also, I believe Kurt Cobain is  for most record sales post humonous at about 29 million dollars worth of music sold after he died. In fact record sales for the band jumped to 82,000 the week after his death due to all the publicity. 
While I may agree with your point that negative publicity does have some consequences in itself, it also spread in the news faster than positive and raises awareness about a band, a product, or new technology.
@_date: 2013-03-16 12:42:32
Thats exactly right.
Inflation of the USD just means that if you put your money in something inflating less than it retains more buying power.
Plus due to bitcoins limited supply (and potential infinite divisibility) as it increases in usage there is increased demand causing further deflation in the BTC economy. This among other factors cause this experimental BTC economy to be prone to consistently deflate and be traded against an inflating currency. 
Our current world system is based on currencies that constantly inflate so we store our value in central banks who loan it and give us itnerest to counter inflation and ideally, turn a small profit. 
Bitcoins idea is to sidestep the bank system and allow someone to keep money in their wallet or pocket and have it deflate there instead of earning interest.

it doesn't matter how many decimal places there are the number still stays the same.
1 BTC = 1.0 BTC = 1.00 BTC = 1.000 BTC
You're confusing inflation with deflation and exchange rates based on the other comments.
With traditional inflation the controlling source of money makes more of it and all the people who had it now immediately are devalued. To combat inflation in our traditional economy we put our money into systems where it gains interest so it doesn't lose value and hopefully gains value.
In a Bitcoin economy it is designed to ,ideally, generally deflate. Even if it stayed 100% even, due to the nature of the dollar always inflating the dollar would always buy less and less bitcoins, the way it takes more and more dollars to buy gas.
Now this deflation is compounded by other factors liek because there can NOT be more bitcoins made then if more people need to use them, then they have to be used in smaller units.. and the whole unit becomes more valuable in USD. Overall this creates a system outside of the banking industry where people can keep money in their wallet and still have it kind of 'gain interest' by having money grow in value.
The reason we would EVER add more decimal places would be just because if a bitcoin exchange rate grew so wildly far apart from traditional currencies that there was say 11 trillion dollars int he bitcoin economy today and 11 million bitcoins in circulation. This would value each bitcoin perhaps at about a million dollars a piece. Now if someone wants to give another person 1$ of a bitcoin they need to give somethign like 0.00000001 BTC. This is when we would want to add a decimal place so that the deflating bitcoin economy could continue to be traded agaisnt the inflating traditional economy.
at this point thought we wouldn't use the decimal places because it would be too hard to read, we would say like 1 MBTC or something like that.
