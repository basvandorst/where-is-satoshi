How the hell can it be more expensive to process credit card payments than to handle cash? Fuck the banks, seriously.

The only one sounding stupid in this conversation is you.

He knew he was breaking the law, sure. But I don't think he knew it would net him double life + 40 years, which is a ridiculous sentence. People get less for murder.

I can still sleep at night I didn't put in too mutch at all. But who likes to lose?

I bought my first bitcoins just before the crash last night.. I feel horrible today, can someone please tell me it will be allright? :(
Edit: Had no idea I would get this many replies, thanks for all the tips guys! My plan for now is to keep my coins and try and get some more now when its low. Hopefully it will pay of in the long run, if not it has all been a fun, albeit frustrating experiment. It also helps with the loss to see i wasn't the only one stupid/unlucky enought to buy just before the crash :D

At about 250. No ofcourse I didnt, but still feels kinda bad loosing all this money considering I had been watching the market for like a month and when I finally decide to strike it crashes, lol. Do you think it will reach 250 again?

I'm considering buying some more when it hits a big low and then just sit on it for a while and hopefully come out with a profit.

So there is no reason to be worried about btc dissapearing? What do you believe caused this crash? Is it the MtGox maintenence and the DDos going on?
