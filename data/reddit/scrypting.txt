Let me know if you need help setting things up. It can get a bit involved :-)

What about a Bitcoin WSOP?
That would be amazing.

Ah I'm sorry I misread your post. There is nothing in the protocol to match an order directly. There is some debate whether this should be included in the protocol or whether it should be handled by the GUI. Probably it makes more sense for the GUI to handle it.
But what you can do is just send a (buy/sell) order at the same price as an existing (sell/buy) order and they will automatically be matched.

Also, the Moto G is an excellent Android phone direct from Google (Google owned Motorola until its recent sale to Lenovo).
Only $179 for the 8GB version unlocked.

Not hard to find that with a pipe wrench

BBBC is used just to demonstrate the naming convention for assets. It doesn't correspond to anything.
Yes XCP is delivered to the same address you use to pay from.
You can view the current market either here: 
Or on the distributed exchange:
The interface is not very user-friendly right now. The developers are working on ironing out bugs in the protocol first.

Check out Counterparty (XCP). It's got a decentralized exchange up and running: 
And here's the block explorer:

A couple of points:
1) Proof-of-burn is a trust-free allocation scheme, not a fundraiser. Nobody received any bitcoins.
2) Right now the market price is something like 5-10x the final burn price, not 100x. This works out to between $10-20mm fully diluted market cap. I don't think this is too surprising given the protocol's potential.

Shocking that it's not even possible to opt out of this "feature".
Yet another reminder to store your own coins.

You can do either. I suggest either posting to this thread: 
or reading through this README:

The problem is: if someone tells you in a calm manner he is planning to use your bitcoins to build a pipe bomb...would you really say no to someone like that? What do you think will happen? He will just politely go away and conduct business elsewhere?
I would be too scared to refuse a person like that...this has to be entrapment on some level.
