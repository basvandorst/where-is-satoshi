The same argument was made for credit / debit cards, and that IS easy. The next question is why change when the current system works just fine?

I see. Sorry about the miss accusation. I'm on alien blue and it wasn't clear so I made a presumption on who replied.
Saving 2% is a significant amount of cash when you're working in the hundreds of millions, but the easy counter argument is since bitcoin is highly volatile in terms of value, such a small % is insignificant if you lose 2% in such a small period of time such as a day due to public demand. Stability and reliability are the most critical elements for any currency, and bitcoin had neither right now.

Sure, but consider the small technological step from KaZaa to Youtube is, and what BitCoins is to traditional currency. It's hardly comparable. Ease of use and availability, while important are only a few attributes out of a huge wealth of critical aspects as to what drives a successful and reliable economy. It's trivializing a hugely complex scenario.

I don't see how ~3% transfer is very very high.
As for your example, that's basic game theory at play, and the same could be done through any conventional means or indirectly (Say I pay for a service with cash but decide to threaten with poor reviews for a refund). This all has very little to do with what currency you use, but more the service.

It's more than nothing, but you said "very, very much".
I want my cash too. But just because there are systems or services in place that charge for managing currency doesn't disqualify the currency.

They provide a service. Almost everything good comes at a cost to someone, and spreading that across the users is a fair trade.
