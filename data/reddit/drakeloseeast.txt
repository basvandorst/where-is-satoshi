They want to stop it as soon as it's not necessary, that's just a hard cap in case they forget to turn it off

Its not improvements . It just tells the network to ignore anything with &gt;  1 MB blocks. So no the other currencies would not want it.

The real problem with exchanges is that they can cancel your account for any reason or get shut down by governments.  That's why you keep some in private storage not for safety concerns.  A proper exchange keeping their reserve in cold storage is safer than any way you could possible manage yourself.

There will be 3 chains come November.  I'm already betting on the one I know will win lol.

How fucking useless is bitcoin if everyone just holds it and doesn't spend any? Imagine  if dollars were like this. The purpose of a currency is to trade. The purpose of bitcoin is to be trusted and anonymous way to trade. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:08:30
Not really, as anyone at a thift store with any idea what it means would keep it for themselves, and anyone who didn't know would not give a higer price.

So are you telling me you use completely cold, softwareless, storage for your crypto or do you, like most people, trust software to manage that? Almost everyone relies on software and hardware(wallets and ledgers) to manage this shit because its complex as fuck.  Just because you have the private keys or whatever doesn't mean there cant be a keylogger or some shit copying everything you do. I can't teach my grandma to setup a facebook account much less secure her private keys(if she had such a thing).  Bitcoin needs to be completely safe and secure and address the massive security issues before it can become mainstream.

Because they seem to make good decisions in general.

BCH don't give a shit what happens to bitcoin. They feel they already won with a coin getting everything they want and a community all on the same page. They are just on the sidelines laughing at us.

2X is a hard fork which breaks a lot of stuff and most aren't prepared for .

You're the government of NK , there's massive sanctions against you, you know your currency is shit, you barely have anything to trade, without nukes you will be wiped off the globe, you need money, why the fuck wouldn't you mind btc? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:01:02
Tells the network to ignore anything bigger than 1Mb block sizes. Basically they don't want the 2x hard fork to happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:43:58
People won't see the problem but hacking is a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM.  Of course your bank account can get hacked and much more easily and your personal info can get hacked, but there a methods and standards in place to protect you in these circumstances, especially if you take messures to protect yourself.  In crypto if you fuck up once, or a company you trust fucks up once all your shit is gone and you have no recourse to recover your funds.  Regardless of what you think about "your money your problem." this is a huge huddle to widespread adoption and the reason I can't just tell friends or family to invest in this space.  
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:04:44
I agree. No hard fork. This has nothing to do with any alt coins I may or may not possess. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:04:19
Way better to pay their rediculous bullshit fees then tell grandma to keep a private seed safe and expect her to not get hacked when she cant even stop her computers from getting viruses.  Remember the goal is to get everyone using bitcoin not just elite tech douches. 
edit: spoken as an elite tech douche.

I wish anytime someone posted a comment like this there was an automatic link to any commits they made on an open source github repro. If there were no commits the comment was simply deleted,  if there were I and others could go through and call out how retarded the commenter actually is.

We are in a bubble, there isn't a single market that doesn't have peaks in valleys.  Once it gets out of the drop will is surpass its current high?  Definitely, but that doesn't mean we are not in a bubble. Dotcom didn't go away after 1999 but it was for sure a bubble.

When you actually use it to buy everyday shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:38:46
It needs to be both. Bitcoin doesn't work as a simple replacement for gold, if is doesn't get widespread use and adoption (which I won't if it's not useful for transctions) no one will use it and it will die. This is the very absolutely basics of bitcoin it's sad that people have to be told this. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:53:43
Everyone who owns BCH owns btc . The whole "bch is against us" bulshit is just what is promoted. Bch doesn't want seg2x because they have a coin that does what they want it to do, they don't gain from btc dying. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:48:01
I read the article and its connection to segwit is pretty flimsy.  The writer seems to think that segwit is needed for lightning networks since it has a fix for transaction malleability.  This isn't the case and lightning networks can added even on chains without segwit.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:09:36
I disagree first rub your dick(or other bits) on it a bit.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:44:22
Funny you don't understand anything yet you continue to type.  The reason the price was going down was all the uncertainty with what will happen with segwit and HF.  Now that both of events have cleared without any issue people are willing to invest in btc again.  
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:14:12
I'm pretty sure everyone supported LN it's just they didn't want to go through core to get it since they can't agree to anything with anything. I won't go into segwit since that argument is already lost there's no point anymore.

Drafting is when you are using the thing in front of you to block wind. It mostly saves energy but isn't really for passing. I have no doubt their is less wind resistance with that method but enough to pass like that ? Amazing if true.

Obviously. Who the fuck got into crypto and thought " oh exchanges are the answer!" Their base is for investors and people buying off pure speculation not peer to peer cash.

@_date: 2017-09-14 22:46:58
Ehhh...  That's pretty hopefully way of looking at it.  This will be a bit test for bitcoin so in that sense it is good.  If it survives this and thrives the price is skyrocket to the moon.

Nah, there wouldn't have been such a massive debate if there wasn't pros and cons . No one controls bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:51:15
This is also why you don't keep your coins on an exchange. An exchange can do this just as easily or easier.
