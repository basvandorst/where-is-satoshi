It is actually quite simple to answer.  Computer power is far more valuable applied to other purposes.

For economic and personal freedom, Mises.org is my favorite site.  It has a good collection of high-quality free market economics and Libertarian articles. for Free Market economics (mostly macro-economics) and Libertarianism articles.
They even have some good articles on historical distortions including the Civil War, real meaning of thanksgiving, and the great depression.  Just beware that if you put any of that historical info in r/politics they go crazy.

I have a background in math and computer science, so I'm not completely lost, however I have a few questions and I'll try to be clear &amp; concise.
I was able to receive 0.05 from a faucet thing, however when I tried sending it to another one of my addresses, it appears that they were lost.
* I have the [bitcoin client](
* I see "your bitcoin address" followed by a hex-number.
* i see a "new..." which allows you to create new addresses.
* I assume those addresses are public keys &amp; safe to share?
* Where do I find the private keys?
* Can I move these onto another computer or piece of paper?
* If I send money that goes nowhere, is it recoverable?

I need to set aside some time for learning android development myself.
*  Many phones already support the 2D barcode through the camera.
*  Barcode contains the (a) receiving address, (b) amount, and (c) optionally text (name or product) and a few checksum bits.
*  Your phone displays the above information.
*  You enter your PIN, passcode, or password
*  Transaction sent.
It might be wise if someone implemented a "my two cents" system, where you send someone 1-2 cents, receive a conformation it was received, then send the rest of the payment.... which helps ensure your payment is going where intended.

I don't believe this would be difficult at all to do at all on a mobile phone.  You know those new 2D barcodes?  You could just take a picture of one, authorize the transaction on your phone, it updates in their system, you get your receipt, and you're on your way.
You would even be able to see the exact amount you are sending. before you sending it... which would be an advantage over credit cards.
I think some layers of security would be prudent for individuals to have.  For example, your "charge account" on your cellphone never has more than $500 worth on it.  Your main bank account is more highly secured on a home computer.

Yes.  I find the burden of proof to be on those that say "loans are necessary for the economy."  I live within my means, and believe others can do the same.
I see financial markets as overhead on the economy, and if people widened up and freed themselves from these markets, they would be much better off.
P.S.  Most of my savings are in metals.

The government recently shut down a gold and silver mint with the justification that it was a "unique form of terrorism."

i finally received the transaction to myself.
I also decided to join one of the miner pools, just to check it out &amp; get some spare change I can experiment with.

Very informative, and thank you for answering my questions directly!

That is where we come back around to the fallacy that debt is good and necessary for the economy.  I, and many others are not convinced.  If people want a fiat currency, I am fine with that, HOWEVER I want a currency that is not based on that system.

Thank you for the reply!  I'm beginning to figure this out....
As someone who's vastly interested in economics and understand computers, i see the value as is.  I suspect this will really take off once it is made more easily accessible to the public (people like my girlfriend).
