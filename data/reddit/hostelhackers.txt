Had to look a second time before I noticed the fat pig on the site

I guess these guys were thinking about another F-word.

Don't attract the bitcoin diggers!
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:04:43
That's one way to try to make BTC bullish again :)
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:19:24
Where can I buy one? :D

Great, seems like a good place to get drunk in Hong Kong!

I would actually follow these bankers and the news.
Just do the opposite what they tell and you'll be rich in no time ;)

It's actually pretty good for the believers :)
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:28:41
Yeah, guess that's all we can do now..

Ok, let's keep 4000$ as long time support please. Freaked a little at 3500$ 
@_date: 2019-02-16 00:47:43
Yeah, I see it be BTC for quite a while still. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:12:13
That's not Thai Baht?

I guess some people will continue to mine it even though it means a short term loss. Might be a year, might be 10 years, but decentralization and blockchain are here to stay. Whether it will be BTC or something else nobody knows, but BTC still has first mover advantage.

I guess it's a typo, forgot a zero
