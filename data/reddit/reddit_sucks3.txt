I was one of the suckers who was trying to sell bitcoin on mtgox when it got to be this high last time. Let's just say I wasn't able to.
Last time the price was this high it was a phantom apparition due to gox.

Nothing shameful about your site. Your site is the shit! Thanks for keeping it up all these years.

Even wikipedia with its known left wing bias clearly states, "While covering the Cologne Carnival live for Belgian television, reporter Esmeralda Labye was groped by attackers, who were apparently of European origin and whom Labye described as speaking German"
Found that by hitting "ctrl + f" and searched for the word "grope".
Yes fall back that liberals are more intelligent blah blah blah. So intelligent they lost the white house, the house, the senate, on and on and on.
The dimension you are living in is not the real one. I hope you have a daughter someday and she gets molested by someone from a culture opposite to a western one because it seems only through direct trial and error can liberals ever learn a lesson.
More sources:
18 women sexually assaulted at a music festival but hey, good thing nobody is getting openly molested in public says "Digi-Digi" of reddit!  Thank god we've cleared all that up. We'll make sure to tell the victims of these attacks that "Digi-Digi" of reddit has proclaimed 'nothing to see here folks'.

Not random in any way. Completely relevant because it clearly shows where the police resources are being allocated. This isn't politics where you will get to swim in an echo chamber of people who agree with you.

Yes the innocent women getting openly molested in public and raped are responsible for the attacks because of geo-political issues.
I would think this is satire but knowing liberals and other mentally retarded left lines of reasoning, it probably isnt.
