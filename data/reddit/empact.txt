The reason we need Bitcoin-first companies - to properly serve the Bitcoin community. Everyone put your entrepreneur hats on! ;)

1) Segwit is a way to reduce transaction fees / increase transaction volume that is already built into bitcoin but is not used by everyone or implemented by every service.
Some people are using non-segwit addresses or services from pure inertia, because it takes time to switch to another. But everyone benefits for each person who makes the switch, e.g.:
* each person switching contributes to lowering transaction fees for everyone else
* if many users switch to services that have adopted segwit, it means the services will be more likely to rush to adopt positive changes like segwit in the future, to avoid losing customers
So posts like these help encourage people to make the switch and point them to services that have done the good work of adopting the change themselves.
Most notably, Coinbase has been the default exchange for many but after months have not made this switch. They deserve to lose customers more than anyone. I've stopped giving them my business.
These sorts of choices and switches are an important part of the way a functioning market work. People vote with their dollars and they get the service they want / deserve.
2) Segwit2x is defunct, you can research the history.
3) BCH (I assume you mean Bitcoin Cash rather than Bitconnect which is BCC) takes a different approach to increasing transaction volume which can help a bit in the short-term but is long-term harmful because it substantially threatens the decentralization on which Bitcoin's security is founded.

I would make a case for switching to a hardware wallet, Trezor or Ledger. Both are segwit-enabled, secure, and enable safe access to your coins. Note with these, you also have effectively a paper wallet you have to keep secure, which is the hardware wallet seed words (and it's very important to keep those secure as you'll need them to restore the wallet in case of failure).

Using Electrum, the "Tools" menu option: "Pay to many".
Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

It's also not meant to be used exclusively of on-chain scaling. This presentation from the creators says you could potentially serve all people in the world with 133 MB blocks: 
I think the general philosophy is: it's important for many reasons not to be spendthrift with chain size. There's no going back from a block size increase, and e.g. doubling block size gives us half as much time to deal with the chain size problem before it arrives, without a lot of benefit in terms of transaction volume. Meanwhile contention for block space *should* help motivate adoption of segwit and roll-out for lightning, which are points of leverage / multipliers for any future block size increase.
For what it's worth, addressing the OP, I've been translating my interest in this into contributions to the open source lightning wallet Zap.

Also interested. :)

Any explanation as to why?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:12:51
I put low fees on non-urgent transactions and they sometimes pend for days.
This shows the pending transactions, stacked by fees.  The miners "mine from the top" bundling the highest-fee transactions, so you may have to wait for them to get to you, or resubmit with higher fees.

I've been panic buying the dip.

Lightning Network is an open protocol implemented in code, like Bitcoin.

Yes, version 3.0+ does, but you'll have to create a new segwit wallet under Electrum if you already have a legacy one.

Sorry you're going to have to look these up yourself.
See the FAQs on Trezor or Ledger.

I expect would be significantly less than half:
* first, transaction would take less space, since transactions are charged on a per-byte basis, that translates directly into lower fees, this is the "30-40% instantly" mentioned in the post.
* second, by clearing more transactions per block, transactions would not build up as much in the mempool ( so people wouldn't need to bid up their fees as much to be included in the next block. This will bring down fees but it's difficult to say how much because it depends on the incoming transaction rate and how it's influenced by the pricing changes.
In any case, together you get: more transactions, less waiting, less contention, lower fees. I switched all but one of my addresses to segwit last week. I also batch my sends to save space.

They go to whichever miner mines each block, along with the block reward. When the block reward goes to zero in ~120 years, they're expected to be the primary mining incentive.

Yeah I would just wait until you need to make some other transaction, and include a second payment to fund your segwit wallet via Electrum's "Pay to many" feature. Batch payments are a great way to save on fees because they split the transaction fee across multiple included payments.

15% and climbing. :)

There’s a full-node supporting refresh of the (higher end) Exodus 1 on the way, according to someone from HTC at The Lightning Conference.

Fun fact: LTC currently has more than 2x the on-chain transaction volume of BCH

Zap runs on testnet by default because, while we use Zap on mainnet daily, we still consider it beta software and we want to allow a bit more time for Zap and LND to mature before making it mainnet by default.
You can, however, run Zap on mainnet by running your own LND instance:
\* Run it locally and it will be detected automatically by Zap on start-up  
\* Run it remotely and use the custom connection settings to establish a connection

A lot of those are likely low-priority utxo consolidation transactions generated by services.
