He can't leave the US but also isn't allowed to work or earn money? That sounds pretty fucked up.

Just reset the blockchain every couple of years so it doesn't get so big!

Yeah but only because he's lucky enough to have people support him. I mean not having to work or earn money actually sounds amazing but only if you know you won't end up out on the street.

I laughed at the jab about not being 16, I think mentioning age like that is only done when the statement/product can't stand on its own so you have to qualify it first by saying "butwait I'm 16!!!"
But complaining about downvotes almost never goes well on Reddit. 
App looks polished though!

Sure not on its own but the cost of electricity to mine it will usually exceed any profits you get from mining.
There are other crytocurrencies that are profitable but typically bitcoin isn't at small scale.

As in coinbase will go down or bitstamp will go up?

He's saying the money you make isn't insignificant with bitcoin. I'm saying the complete opposite is true. You usually lose money mining bitcoin unless you have a massive farm. 
Did you read either comment?

Let me read back the comment thread to you






Literally everything in this thread has been about mining bitcoin. He refers to income in BTC. You quoted him talking about mining bitcoin. 
Are you just fucking with me? Because I have absolutely no idea what you could possibly think he's talking about other than mining bitcoin. If you're not then please tell me what you think he's talking about because you seem to just be telling me I'm wrong without actually saying what he's actually talking about.
