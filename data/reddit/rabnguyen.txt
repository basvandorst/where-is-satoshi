I've tried few mobile wallets: Jaxx, Trust, Ethos &amp; Infinito Wallet. 
\-Trust is quite good if you are big fan of Binance and prefer daily trading. However the number of coins &amp; tokens supported are still limited. 
\-Ethos &amp; Jaxx now I don't use any more. They were quite good at the beginning but then the UX UI isn't smooth anymore.
\-Infinito: they support a lot of coins, tokens and add new coin every month. UI UX is quite good and they also have DApps. But they are more like storage, not for easy trading on exchange like Trust. However for safety, i think this will be better than Trust. They support 12 word passphrase, private key. Also have password and fingerprint for more layer of privacy. They easy to use and have multi wallets too.
They have both Android, iOS. just remember your passphrase or private key then you can import to any device. 
So if you want to send/receive funds from exchange to hot wallet everyday then use Trust. But if not, just weekly/monthly sending funds, then Infinito is good. 
You can try install some of them and create a new wallet, experience for few days then choose what you want.

I mean the fact that "**74% of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy**" is not really true.

hmmm I skim the whole research but see no clear connection between many researches they did. It's not really persuasive for me.
