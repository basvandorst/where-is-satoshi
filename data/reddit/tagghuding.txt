did you buy the upvotes for your post with bitcoin as well? seems like no one buys your rationale for posting this drivel.

it's important that we read the prophet and interpret his words correctly, otherwise the impending judgement day will never come.

You're right, april 2012 :( saw it on hacker news today and decided to post it here, and searched for the URL as well.

TL;DR: While the FBI recognises that Bitcoin provides stronger anonymity when used correctly, and will see increased usage for illegal activity, they remain confident in their ability to intercept illegal users in the "interface" between the bitcoin economy and the fiat currency world.

Probably boredom, as you say. And proof-of-concept. Basically he said that they wanted to try and take over a relatively small but still significant block-chain that they didn't control themselves. But of course, one cannot exclude other purposes...

Come on, this is *not* gonna happen. FWIW ThyssenKrupp will be able to continue selling their submarines, and there will be *no* cases of corruption found on higher levels.


That's more like it.
What I don't get is how they believe they (you, OP?) will be able to track Bitcoin transactions. Sure, companies trading bitcoins for real money will be traced within the EU. But for the bitcoin transactions themselves, wouldn't you just generate a throwaway address and transact them to your partner's throwaway address? 
Oh, and Bitcoin is not mentioned in the article. The [service to be regulated]( seem to be more or less an alternative to paypal and has very little in common with Bitcoins. I downvote this one and urge the OP to repost in @_date: 2011-09-13 13:39:52
How is he breaking the law? It's a public network, isn't it?

Oh god, this is gonna be even better than the "signed, official e-mail" and almost as good as the "Kinderpornosperrengesetz". Would you please link to the article so that we can confirm that it's this lunatic Hans-Peter Friedrich that is at it again? And what did he say about terrorists and pedophiles this time?

[This]( was the link. Obviously "the namecoin guy" responding to the attack.

Nice find!

Would you, kind sir, perhaps be interested in buying this very fine bridge? A very exclusive offer, indeed.

Thanks for explaining your reasonings. I personally might think "what happens on the internet stays on the internet", and that this might be similar to for example cases where people have "stolen" property in second life or WoW. However, I have no real idea either.

Yo, talk to my buddy Bernie Madoff, best rates in town.

It's amusing that people are this stupid each time. Moreover, doesn't the idea of a "bitcoin bank" go against the central concept of bitcoin anyway? Does that mean a majority of its users doesn't understand what's going on?

Oh with bernie's investments you'll be owning that bridge in no time!
