If you're in the US, find a US-based firm that smells okay (despite availability/capacity issues, when I first looked Coinbase were the only people who passed muster).  See if they have an actual exchange, because there are types of purchases on an exchange that can incur *no fees* because the transactions don't incur a block chain cost.  Fees on the "retail" side can eat you alive on the small scale.  Brush up on your tax rules (this is not as nightmarish as it could be, although there can be some spreadsheet hell involved).  Set up an account that can be locked down with at least 2FA.  Transfer in some money you can afford to lose, and then...
*Simply watch the exchange for two weeks to a month.*  Do *not* just throw in on the first thing that looks promising because it'll likely cost you money.  Spend this time reading about the various currencies so you know what you're actually investing in.  Who else is using the currency?  Does it have any real-world utility (i.e. can it be exchanged for fiat at more than just this exchange)?  How much of it typically changes hands in a day and how is it *generated*?   For sure some of the altcoins *sound* like a great deal, but most are little more than a scam.
Remember: making uninformed decisions is just as bad as hasty decisions and will lose your money.

Well, there's some "know your customer" laws that probably apply to the use of such a system.  Getting tagged for money laundering is not just a remote possibility in the US with this stuff.
When you saw what the machine valued BTC at versus what normal exchanges show, you would have been fairly likely to walk away if you were familiar with market prices.  By my guess, people buying less than a dozen bitcoins would have paid for the hardware and costs of installation.  To me that seems a bit more of an added cost than is really necessary. 
...as to what's up, I'm still doing Linux, but now Android as well.  :)

There's a few in Nashville, and all I could think when I saw them was what kind of rube would pay *that* high a transaction fee.

Mainly you bring a machine online long enough to perform the transaction, and then you *take it back offline*, commonly by shutting it down and/or unplugging it. Practically any old PC or laptop can serve in this capacity. 
...but nothing is going to help as long as you keep doing *incredibly foolish things* like storing credentials *in plaintext* on a *network-accessible resource*.  ...and *reusing credentials*.  That's literally infosec 101.  No cookie for you.  OMG man.  This sort of thing is the primary reason the lowest form of script kiddie out there ever shows a profit.

Being that they're trying their damnedest to stay on the good side of US regulators, there's an almost zero chance they'd do something shifty like that.  It could *very* easily result in another policy clarification with *their* name on it.

So what?  In case you haven't noticed, there's *lots* of people doing (and saying.. ahem) stupid things on the internet all the time.  That doesn't make mapping names to IP addresses "wrong".  IP transport isn't magic, and you're certainly never getting people to type in IPv6 addresses on a regular basis, let alone "remember* them.  A mechanism like DNS is *required* for any network larger than a few nodes. 
...unless perhaps you're expecting packet traffic to be handled by *magical fairies*, the alternative would be a hosts file that would be *breathtakingly massive* and the size problem would only be eclipsed by how often it would require updating.
As to the rest, I have no idea what larger role you expect "continuity" to play, and your talk of pinning certificates is just silly.  They actually *are* being used by more and more people, but they're not particularly relevant to a commodity web browser (they lie within the domain of application security, which brings in an even bigger pile of issues).  You are of course perfectly welcome to get in a car and drive yourself to offices where servers are located and personally eyeball and sign each cert yourself and then replace the CAs in your web browser with your signing cert, or simply trust that the first time you go to a site you're talking to the right one, sign that cert yourself and again replace your CA store.  There's a reason it's called a "chain of trust", man.
For your users, if you can convince them to install your executable application code (cue ominous music) containing a pinning certificate, your impersonation problem disappears.  However, most folks consider it a win if their users are even *aware* of a lock icon.
Also, a lame CA issuing a cert they shouldn't **will never** require a cert holder to invalidate *their own* cert unless both that CA and the cert purchaser we're both doing something just *jaw-droppingly stupid* like sending their private key to the issuing CA, or letting the CA generate their private key and CSR.  Seriously.  Ne-ver.  That's just not how certs work.

This is simply incorrect.  Expecting DNS to do things that *it does not do* causes "security issues".
Using names to map to IP addresses is perfectly reasonable when coupled with a mechanism (like certificates) that can be used to verify the identity of the remote end.

How good are you at making really bad choices in selecting a database architecture?  ;)

"some are created with expiration dates?"
Man, most CAs will practically *scold you* if you send them a CSR with a ridiculous future expiration date.  Not to mention that this would negatively impact the commercial CA's revenue.
Also, I'm not saying that there *aren't* CAs that would be silly enough to offer a completely managed key service, but I'm pretty sure the larger the network is, the more likely the organization is to have someone (or multiple someone's) *in-house* whose responsibilities explicitly include keeping the secret key secret.  Heck, I've been that guy a few times.
As to your other points, verification of identity is *simply not DNS's job*.  We literally have other tools for this and it's just not appropriate to try and force this functionality into DNS.   DNSSEC is enough for the vast majority of connections that might involve plaintext (clearly in cases where we don't really care if there's tampering), and for everything else we *already* have separate mechanisms for performing identity verification.  If the system can recognize that the other party is *not* the right one, our security model is *fine*.  Only a fool would *ignore* a trust chain failure.  Since we can't *prevent* packet tampering, we have to be able to *detect* it, dig?  DNS lookups are literally only the first layer in establishing connections across a large IP network.  What you're talking about would be akin to putting DRM chips into RJ45 connectors to protect ARP traffic.
