Aha, i see. I didn't know there where miners involved in validating transactions. I thought they only decoded new bitcoins. Thanks!
Mind if I ask some questions about mining?
Is everyone one involved in the network a miner per se? Or is this a designated subpopulation?
which tasks involve mining apart from mining new coins and validating transactions?

You say integration costs are minimal, but what exactly are they? 
Also I hear people talk about low fees per transaction, but I always thought there are no fees at all. Who might be feeing here if I may ask?

Thanks for this! I don't understand how one makes a backup of a online wallet. Or does this only goes for wallets on your computer?

How come? You just transfer USD to their bank account right?

What makes you think that?

Total noob here. 
As I understand it, a bitcoin is a code instead of a coin or bill right? Then, If I have 50 bitcoin in my account, does that mean I am the owner of 50 different codes? And if I lose one code, then the coin will be lost forever for everyone?
Also, if I pay 0,50btc to someone, what happens to the original code of one of my bitcoiNs?

Where was this?
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:31:31
Aha, thanks. so how does that work? Which countries are easier?
@_date: 2013-10-22 09:51:42
Well, I assume those companies charge right? Makes it less attractive, no?

Thank you. So there are fees indeed. That one cent transaction fee, is that in dollars or btc? Also, where does this money go?
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:56:24
Thanks! What about using it on public computers and networks?
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:07:53
Where did you got this code from?
Also, I thought that the post on cointalk dated August 2010, and this transaction is from may. But I'm on phone so will check on that later. Thanks!

With get it out you mean to get BTC from BTC-e to your wallet?
Their FAQ is not really clear about this. But I read 0,2%, could that be the case? Seems like a lot indeed.

Can you tell me what's the best way to convert bitcoin payments to fiat immediately?
Also, I think this can only be done with small payments right? what's the treshold?

Does he need that? I think many big names in information law want to handle his case for free.
