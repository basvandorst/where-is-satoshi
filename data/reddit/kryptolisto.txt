Are you kidding, bro? Kraken is the most stable and most secure exchange. Bitfinex has been hacked and did a bail in, outrageous! Coinbase cancelled my bro s order four day s later, they svck. Bitstam aint safe, you know what happened some time ago. And if you re trying to short, you re not in for the big thing. Bit gonna go to the tens, especially now that the etf want approved. (etf with f dic???gimme a break!!!)

"Losses" in what? in dollars, euros, pesos, or whatever other shitty paper currency? Man, focus on cryptos. Kraken offers monero and a couple of other ones, go get them. Today they included that melon thing. That s where the profits are!

euros wont exist in a couple of months. holland is getting out of the ECB, and france is to follow, after their election. bitcoin, not euros!!!

Maybe it s your fault. Why you guys so eager to get rid of BTC, when the exchange rate to fiat goes down a few euros? Cant you hold on to it, show the market you really believe it s gonna be 10k? Roger is long on BTC and he understands low time preference. Look it up!

All pricing is arbitrary and subjective...

If you dont want to hold on to your btc because the exchange with fiat dropped like 5%, try something else. BTC is "mercurial", but will be going to the moon. I d trade altcoins in Kraken, cause they know how to pick the good ones

i dont understand why people do not bother to get cryptos and then go trading other cryptos. If you dont like the euro or any other state mandated currency, bother to get some cryptos, do not just rely on the banks

Some agents at SynapsePay often do not know of Kraken contacting them, neither do they know of their company's verification requests.
