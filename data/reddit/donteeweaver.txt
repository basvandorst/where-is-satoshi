I don't feel its a shitcoin but me buying NEO at as high as $180! And again FOMO at $100 thinking it wouldn't see those days again.
But who else is investing in MCO?

I believe Bitcoin will see a $100k day well before $0.00, and more and more people and businesses consider it to be valuable

@_date: 2019-06-28 23:12:03
Exactly. Its still not a horrible move. No way to have timed it plus you got in earlier and held longer than alot of people

ONLY 50 Bitcoin every few months...
I'd take 50 Bitcoin a year at this point!
Not to mention the majority won't have 50 Bitcoin in a life time��
