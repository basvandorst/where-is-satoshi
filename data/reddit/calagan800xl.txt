I certainly appreciate your effort, but I do have some doubts about what you call "little family owned forex", unless you consider local mafias as families.

I'm all in for the technology and libertarian aspects of bitcoin, but when sh.t hits the fan, it's also good to a bit of trading so you can make profit even its value goes down, by placing short orders.

Being from Switzerland, I don't think Zurich has its place in this ranking, especially ahead of Tampa which has so many more merchants for a smaller population.
Maybe they gave too much weight to the couple of ATMs, which are IMHO an expensive gimmick: serious bitcoin aficionados would probably withdraw a few bucks from those to show off to their friends, but in the end,you're always better off using an exchange.
Moreover, besides Ljubiana, I would expect more cities from Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and Russia in this list.

IMHO, for average Joe's adoption, there are two things you need to be able to buy with bitcoin:
* groceries
* gas
I'd say that the ANX Premium debit cards come pretty close to achieving that goal: it's a USD-based MasterCard, the fees are reasonable, but it has two deal-breaking shortcomings:
* It doesn't have an EMV chip, so if you live in Europe, it's gonna be useless in 99% of the POS, which require it for security reasons (still OK in ATMs though, but then you have to deal with the fees)
* It does not have your name printed on it, so in the US, which is not requiring the EMV chip, stingy merchants might not accept it, especially when purchasing booze or tobacco (you may or may not consider those a groceries)

Your sis is definitely not cheap, but I strongly agree that giving bitcoins to your friends and relatives can be very efficient.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm giving away 50 mBTC paper wallets that I print myself to my close friends, always mentioning that they have been mined with love and care on my S5 miner, hosted somewhere in Central China and letting them know about the nearby BTM.
Also when I sell stuff on auction or classified adds, I always let the buyer know I accept bitcoin and offer them perks like free shipping if they choose this method.

I guess a better question would be "who is NOT using Fidor for SEPA?", because if at some point they get in trouble and shut down all their BTC exchanges clients accounts, then shit is seriously gonna hit the fan if they are the only available option.
I found those two so far:
- ANXBTC uses the Baltic International Bank in Latvia
- BTC-E uses Ceska Sporitelna in Czech Republic

I'm not a fan of regulations, but speaking so strongly against FDA regulations is really playing with fire, or more concretely, the health of millions of people.

Very nice! Now I'm tempted to ask my baker to prepare a white chocolate Spondoolies SP20 cake, for my upcoming birthday.

I would expect an Amazon card purchased via Gyft to work in any of the Amazon stores outside US. Anybody tried before?
Also Newegg, which accept bitcoin ships to several countries outside US.

Hmm.. Hard to win this kind of wiki battle unless you have a lot of time on your hands. Maybe time to register the domain paperecdsaprivatekeys.com it's still available right now.

One could argue that in the unlikely but possible event that the bitcoin's value drops to 0$, you'd have a really hard time to find anyone to transfer your bitcoins to.

Reading the statement below in the FAQ I wonder how you can get a confirmed address from someone who pays with Bitcoins?
 "Important Shipping Notice!

Dropping the gold standard allowed federal banks to completely rig the system with such measure as quantitative easing, so yes gold standard was a good thing. Several national banks are still required to maintain a percentage of gold in their portfolio, which provides them with some form of insurance during periods of economic crisis. 
Storing and moving large amounts of gold can be problematic, for security reasons, national banks in Europe are actually storing their gold in Fort Knox, which obviously raise issues about independence towards the USA: this wouldn't be necessary with bitcoins.
Using bitcoins as a standard indeed solves a lot of problems and brings some much needed transparency, but right now, with so much volatility, it's probably too much of a risk to adopt it.

SBEX, with its  service and its BTM network claims to be the "first legal bitcoin broker in Switzerland"; when I bought bitcoins from them, I found out they were using Fidor. 
Big disappointment: although SEPA transfers are cheap, national bank transfers are much faster and usually free.
