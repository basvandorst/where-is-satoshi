"BullionVault gold is held fully allocated to BullionVault users. It is insured, and stored in your choice of location. The gold is your legal, physical property."
"We want you to be 100% confident in BullionVault records, so we have our own Daily Audit checked annually by our own external auditors - Albert Goodman."
Looks quite legit to me...

There is also [SuisseGold.com]( where you can buy your precious metals in... bitcoins!
(You own what you buy and can ask the serial numbers to be sure)

When they don't risk loosing 50% in a few days...

Yes, keep hodling, maybe one time we'll be able to reach *exactly* 100% loss. It will always be better to face the *real reality* that we have been pwned.

Yes, banks reopen but capital controls remain in place...

I've heard a thousand 1000 bill stacked up will be 14cm in height. That's a million CHF :) but also 1875cm^3. In that same volume one could fit approx 1,4 million CHF of gold (the weight will be much higher though) and gold is at its lowest. Now with that new bill, one could fit a million CHF in just 375cm^3 (assuming both bills have the same dimensions). The value of that same volume in gold is of approx 278k CHF!
Or, one could use bitcoins!
