Weekend? Okay look man, as long has you haven't panicked sold anything then you're doing fine. Thing is, buying at the top of a rally was poor choice but as long as you look at it as a long term investment it'll be fine. Bitcoin will one day be worth greater than 11,300.USD.

Buying and investing are the same thing. I will not limit my speech to best suit your feelings. :P

My girlfriend bought at $1000/BTC and then she bought another four BTC's at $600 to lower her buying average. 
Try doing the same, Dingle berry.

I wrote "Canadians specifically should invest in Bitcoin" because this article is about Canadian people specifically.
P.s. I believe all people have an equal collective interest to be involved in Bitcoin.

You're such a tool bag,
"Dear BTC-e.com participants,
We are concerned by MtGox shutdown and would like to assure you that:
1. MtGox losses do not affect account balances or the operation of BTC-e in any way.
2. We confirm the Bitcoin system operation and its exciting prospects, and MtGox bankruptcy has not been caused by any underlying technical problems of Bitcoin. Bitcoin international peer-to-peer network and cryptocurrency are independent of actions of a single market participant. Bitcoin protocol continues to function exactly as it should. The cryptocurrency maintains its stability and the network will continue to develop and exist as long as required by its users.
3. At BTC-e we are constantly monitoring Bitcoin accounts and FIAT reserves. At BTC-e we continue to maintain all clients’ assets in full – both Bitcoin and FIAT.
4. BTC-е has no vulnerabilities during client transactions as we use safe and proven transaction protocols. All transaction issues reported by our clients undergo a thorough check.
The safety of client funds and transactions is of ultimate importance for the company, and this is the reason why we have been an industry leader for the last three years.
1. BTC-е is at its peak of financial strength with the record levels of clients and capital adequacy. The company plans to start publishing financial statements, verified by an external audit, on a regular basis.
2. The highest levels of security are already in place at BTC-e, and the company regularly uses external professional advice to further increase the security of our clients.
3. BTC-e is the only exchange to offer a modern trading platform, MetaTrader 4, to its clients, and many other exciting projects and further upgrades are in the pipeline.
The company plans to soon begin to publish publicly available statements certified by external auditors."
This does not sounds like a shady company to me.

Why doesn't anyone just be honest with her! Someone needs to just say, "Look, you've got it wrong. You have no evidence, and you've endangered with elderly man for NO reason."

Because Huobi is a much larger exchange, I believe.

I used to go to BMO (Bank) and wire transfer money to an exchange called CAVertex or something like that, back in the day (2011-2012). So going to the bank to buy bitcoin has already kinda happened
