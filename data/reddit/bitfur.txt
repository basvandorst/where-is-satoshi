I appreciate these comments and feedback. 
Manticlops - curious, do you happen to recommend a phone wallet with legacy addresses? What exchange do you recommend I use? You are right I am not using Bittrex ever again. I really would not prefer to use my Motorola Android but...
acered24 - I already reset both wallets 3x and the segwit addresses is all that comes up and downloads automatically so I have no control.
c\_r\_y\_p\_t\_ol - thanks I guess I need to do a little more research but I already purchased the Ledger Nano S and Nano X so I wanted to find a non segwit address to configure on Ledger Live.

Thanks cir2kuk, this has to be the back up plan. I'm never doing business again with Bittrex.

Dude, this is an awesome way of describing it for me to truly understand the sovereign individual wealth and power behind what bitcoin represents! I want my store of wealth deeply secured! I appreciate you my brother. Have a good night, respectfully yours, Bitfur.

Thanks a lot Manticlops for the reply. I hear you! regarding staying far away from Bittrex. Thanks for the idea on the phone wallet, I just wouldn't feel comfortable transferring it to my phone first, I'm not that tech savvy yet ;)

Thanks for the reply FunOptimizer42. That's the challenge or issue I dont have the search option to setup an account that is nonsegwit.

You're right man! The Status field has now changed to Confirmed in green text. It says Confirmed (16). Curious, what does the (16) in parenthesis mean? Quick other question: I noticed in the To: field, there are 9 addresses presently there. I'm  (second from the bottom) if you count from the top down. Curious, why is there 9 addresses? And not just 1 being addressed just to me. Thank you very much for your wisdom on this topic. I really appreciate your guidance.

WillTheThrill1969 - I was successfully able to transfer my bitcoin off of Bittrex to a non segwit BTC address. Many thanks for your direction on this!  Quick question, in the Operation Details Window under the Status field, the transaction reads Unconfirmed (0). Would you know what this means? Thanks again for your guidance on this topic - Respectfully, Bitfur.
