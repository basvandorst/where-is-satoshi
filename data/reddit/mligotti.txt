It should be illegal to be cash only! Selfishly cause I never carry cash...
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:59:27

I sold one at 7k, hopefully don't regret this...

No cash register at all there

True. Some also may say “millennial”.

dumb question - but how do you transact bitcoin without internet/electricity?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:44:44
I have more. figured if no correction, this will be my profit and the rest stays in my hardware wallet until it hits millions ��

edit: i'm a young white man and disagree with the "racist" card. this is an observation on who is coming out against bitcoin.

How’s that being a moron? It’s called spreading awareness...
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:56:36
Coinbase.com is your easiest way in, but your best bet is comparing each site's fees and markets to see which you trust most then take that money offline to a hardware wallet if you want to HODL

so true

i assume this is what they would do since btc transaction wouldn't keep up. but from the video it seems more like just an idea to get involved yet and allow their customers to purchase btc on their market? awesome to see them push for their customers wants

Nano or Trezor have security back ups that USB/Paper doesn't. It's better for beginners compared to encrypted USB because if you forget that pass you're out of money. Same for paper if you lose that or it gets burnt in a fire, etc.

updated gif while i wait for my transactions to confirm...

Shit - just ordered a trezor for like 160 USD... I heard anything connected to Internet was immediately at risk.

Shipping was about 25 euros and had to pay extra for it to ship because of high demand with the soft fork approaching. 133 euros total :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:10:01
EUR 133 -- this seems like my best bet
