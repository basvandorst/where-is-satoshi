if what you say comes to pass, i imagine that the entire derivatives market will be seen for the credit-based bubble that it is.
if this is the case, and the derivatives market cap collapsed, i believe people would at that point be desperate to find a store of value that could withstand such an event.
since fiat is directly complicated and intrinsically dependent on the derivatives market, it could signal the collapse of all *truly insecure* credit, which, if you zoom out far enough, is pretty much all of it given the scale of the bubble.
it starts to look like there will be very few assets that offer the same secure utility and value as crypto would,
which should help it gain more popular adoption,
driving the price to the moon.

one could argue that ICOs have similar utility as credit with regards to bitcoin. 
i believe that when the political body that governs the economy which determines the value of the currency is engaging in speculative investment, it creates a potential for political conflict of interest and catastrophe.
investment of realized monies is fine, however the generation of credit backed by nothing but false potential is problematic.

governments and globalists everywhere are slowly restricting people's ability to transact with cash; the current general trend facilitates a situation where all participants in a modern economy would necessarily be forced to interact with the financial infrastructure developed and sold by the plutocracy.
for example, cash transactions above €1000 are illegal in Spain and France.
KYC-AML is a tool used by elite financial cartels to control us. the same often goes for any legislation that prohibits liberties under the guise of thwarting terrorist financing or fraud.
bitcoin is disruptive to this effort. so far, political attitudes toward bitcoin at this stage are frontier perspectives. American power-holders see nations that stand in stark contrast to them politically and ideologically, like Venezuela or China, oppose or become agitated by bitcoin.
bitcoin comes across to be a tool for the utility of liberty,
and even though these are dark fucking times,
mainstream American politicians don't want to appear to undermine liberty.

Satoris are physical *coins* that contain the cryptographic keypairs that give access to a standard 0.001 BTC;
the price of the Satori should likely reflect the value of the bitcoin held within (0.001 BTC), and a premium for the physical product itself.
essentially the idea is that people without internet connection can still spend bitcoins just like they would cash, by physically supplying vendors with physical bitcoins.

um well he is familiar with C and E considering those are the languages first used to configure the network.
he produced something called Bit Gold prior to Bitcoin, and if that was available for review, it might give some direct insight into his style of coding, however i havent actually been able to find a repo for Bit Gold, so i cant associate the apparently idiosyncratic coding style of Satoshi with that of Szabo.

okay so basically Sgantzos is saying that CTD, when applied to algorithmic automata, has the potential to produce native *genetic algorithms* within the blockchain, which, if are truly native, represent a form of artificial intelligence that, once following probabilistic optimization, could lend itself to applications for mining and understanding big data.
sort of like using the artificial synesthesia of a massive neural network to solve complex problems.
what i'm not grasping tho is which resource these native *genetic algorithms* could utilize to reference themselves given that for a dataset of limitless completeness, the Turing Machine requires limitless memory. 
i'm having trouble intellectually linking the CTD with the blockchain; [it was my understanding that CTD was used to describe the potential Turing-completeness of a quantum computer.](

the idea of *fungibility* is paramount to the utility of bitcoin however it does have implications with regards to ownership of property and therefore tort law.
it will be an interesting philosophical debate because as of right now, it is actually a preferred characteristic of bitcoin that stolen coins do now actually belong to the thief, 
that the true owner of the bitcoins are the individuals that are in possession of the cryptographic keypairs that can authenticate the control of those bitcoins.
i dare say that applying the concept of tort law to bitcoin could negatively affect its fungibility.

subsequent softforks should help to scale bitcoin and reduce mempool constraints.
as segwit propagates, the mempool should reflect it.
moreover, hashrate applied to the network is undermined by a previous hardfork's unwieldy emergency difficult adjustment, causing the unsustainable perceived profitability of mining there.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:42:13
oh wow.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:19:23
hastily allowing for an intense increase in block weight will not automatically and instantly solve the scaling issue. 
instead it will open the network to spam attacks which could see a seriously brutal increase in the total weight of the blockchain, therefore increasing the probability of node centralization.
the parameter itself is a technical security parameter primarily used to defend against spam and dust attacks.
increasing the throughput of bitcoin will not have a beneficial effect on scaling if all that extra throughput is used to abuse the network.

if you have no software solution to do this,
i recommend determining a factor that represents the current conversion rate of bitcoin's price to your fiat of choice minus a discount,
multiplying the price of your product with that factor,
and charging the customer the coefficient. 
for example,
if i have something i am selling for $123, and i want to offer customers a chance to pay a discount when they pay with BTC, 
[i would go to my favorite converter,]( find out how much bitcoin $1 is worth, we'll call that variable *x*,
then multiply 123 by *x*.
you can adjust *x* by making it slightly smaller to reflect a discount.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:37:46
i think its because they are simply the largest exchange.

adam back, wei dai, and hal finney have all released private email correspondence they had with satoshi.
when satoshi developed bitcoin, he was in contact with these three people. 
bitcoin has so many uncanny similarities with szabo's prior *bit gold*, and during bitcoin's development, satoshi specifically mentions drawing inspiration from adam back and wei dai's work.
if satoshi knew adam back via the cypherpunks and crypto mailing lists, chances are he also knew of szabo, who, like i said had previously created *bit gold*.
however there is curiously zero correspondence between szabo and satoshi. 
if nick szabo really was satoshi, it starts to look like he deliberately paid no mention of szabo so as not to draw attention to himself.
also right before bitcoin was released, szabo began blogging intensely about the philosophy and application of a *bitcoin-like* innovation. 
once the project was released and traction was being gained,
szabo went back and altered the date on that blog update to reflect a less suspicious timeline.

your situation is common. 
the best way to obtain bitcoins are to accept them as payment for the goods or services you provide. us normies that don't sell any goods or services are left with a few options.
Localbitcoins is one of them. arranging electronic payments in exchange for bitcoin is easy there. 
bitcoin ATMs are another option however they can be an expensive way to acquire them.
exchanges will work eventually however like you mentioned it is at the cost of all your dox.
the truth seems to be that the trouble occurs when individuals start trying to exchange *fiat for bitcoin*. if there is a way you can think of to remove fiat from your method of acquiring bitcoin, it will make the process less invasive.

people *do* run malicious or poor code over the network and it *is* completely fucked up. 
in case you didn't notice, bitcoin has been suffering from a civil war that has seen multiple attempts to hardfork the code, and has resulted in numerous chainsplits.
the network itself protects the blockchain, and efforts to permanently change it or the code that governs it actually end up making it stronger,
this is why people refer to bitcoin as *antifragile*.
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:40:49
the worst part of all is
Gavin Anderson at one point suggested that the real Satoshi deserves repository access, then went and said he truly believed Craig Wright to be Satoshi.

the 12 word *seed* is used to recover your Electrum wallet.
your Electrum wallet contains your cryptographic keypairs.
the *password* used to protect your Electrum wallet cannot be used exclusively to recover your wallet, 
although the *seed* will restore your Electrum wallet, your actual cryptographic keypairs can be used to manipulate your coins without requiring the use of Electrum.

when we begin to see fractional reserve lending of bitcoin,
then we are in trouble.
applying a system of credit to bitcoin will be an enormous step back i believe.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:57:48
cryptographic keypairs are used to transact digital tokens that are certified by solving a math problem asked by a previous block, via applied hashrate, thereby generating a new block, which issues new coins and validates transactions,
creating a distributed immutable chain-like database, block by block, authenticated by a decentralized network of nodes.

as it becomes more widely adopted, its value will rise and it will become more ubiquitous as a form of payment. 
then it will be easier and more economic to spend it.
you can shop online with bitcoin using [All4Btc]( so i'd say Amazon or eBay. also using bitcoin is still probably the easiest way to get cocain, which i'm certain interests you. jk.

speculative arbitrage about the fork is immaterial to bitcoin's fundamental value or success. just hodl it.

here's your answer, OP.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:03

yeah. its real. 
i assume he doesn't maintain a personal relationship with caitlyn anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:28:53
the way i see it, those forked coins are only valuable if you are able to sell them. i believe the more and more bitcoin hard forks, the less valuable these forked tokens will be worth. 
you're right though, there will likely always be at least nominal value in the coin after it forks and before it flatlines.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:53:07

have fun ignoring the nuances of price arbitration and good luck
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:42:17
well with regards to arbitrage speculation, yeah i have no idea. all the hard forks are as valuable as any altcoin to me.
i hodl bitcoin because i value the potential it has to really last, i mean really last. in my opinion a lot of these forks, especially regarding BTG, are opportunistic and predatory because of the zealous arbitrage market. 
its a head game tho, everyone wants you to believe they have the strongest chance for longevity.
with regards to dev teams tho, what are your options. the devs are core are at least in tandem with a legacy that conceived the advent and continue to improve it.

BitPay may have a solution to this;

@_date: 2017-10-05 17:46:59
sometimes depending on the vendor or method, you can accomplish fairly substantial trades on Localbitcoins without doxing yourself,
however for the most part the easiest way to remain anonymous is to use a BTC-ATM.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:08:37
bitcoin is complex and the material regarding its nature is profound even for only being a few years of age.
this sort of question gets asked about five times a day in this sub, and i don't have the common copypasta to throw at you,
however if you really want to learn, i recommend listening to all three podcasts where Andreas Antonopoulos appears on The Joe Rogan Experience. that is your introductory lecture. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:59:40
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:56:05
it can lead to disruption, yes.
for example, if Satoshi went to sell off their entire collection of Genesis-era coins with any measure of desperation,
it would flood the market with cheap coins, thereby driving down the price.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:47:08
looks like Coinizi doesn't work either.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:17:53
this is the real answer.
required reading for all serious enthusiasts. also satoshi was a very decent writer and they explained things concisely.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:55:17
what was the total size of your fee?
which wallet did you use to transact;
are you eligible for fee replacement?
depending on how this rollercoaster goes, your tx should likely confirm over the weekend.

standard KYC-AML requires you to use your real name on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:59:11
your coins for all intent and purpose should be safe,
however, any number of things could happen behind the scenes at blockchain.info that would cause you to lose your coins.
you never really own your coins unless you control the keys. i suggest using Electrum.

OP's tx will be confirmed by October 30.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:44:35
he cant even copy/paste properly 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:01:45
wow pretty sure i saw you posting on /biz/ yesterday
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:40:28
there are a few ways to collect bitcoins.
[Localbitcoins.com]( is a great place to start. this method can be easy, however depending on what you want, you may be forced to dox yourself.
[Satoshi Tango]( is probably going to be the exchange of choice for R$. again you'll be giving up your identity documents to acquire coins.
coins can be purchased at an ATM; [there is one in Sao Paulo as far as i can tell,]( however there is often a significant markup for the anonymity it provides.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:30:20
i assume BitPay supports the protocol by providing a way to customize transactions such that they have multiple outputs, tho i'm not sure how; i've never used it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:13:18
if you're truly hodling then keep them in a wallet. there should be some wallets that can handle multiple alts, like coinomi.
if i was trading alts to the tune of 1 BTC or more, yeah i would simply use a dedicated machine and establish a strong organization of wallets. 
if you are practising arbitrage on alts then the fees going to and from the exchange should be part and parcel of the habit.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:35:52
tokens dedicated to lost keypairs should technically affect the total market capitalization unless compensated for, yes.
however i don't believe this can explicitly disallow the price to go to zero.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:21:34

then you will be better prepared not only to answer your mom's questions but your entire family and friends'.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:00:57
you want to accept payments in bitcoin, okay.
what else did you want to do?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:50:39
the amount of money that gets invested in bitcoin *does* have an indirect affect on the price,
but the price itself only goes up or down according to what the market is willing to accept in exchange for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:26:55
do you mean
"how can changes be made to the way bitcoin itself functions?"
the network is authenticated by nodes, which execute bitcoin's protocols,
and perpetuated by miners, which also execute functions according to code.
in computer programming, when you make changes to existing code, your code is referred to as a fork.
anybody can alter or change this code and run it, and apply it to the network. when a change in the code is made and it is applied to the network, and the fundamental structure of the blockchain does not change, it is referred to as a soft fork.
changes that require fundamental changes to the blockchain, sometimes resulting in the creation of a new chain, are referred to as hard forks.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:45:53

neither have a passionate interest for the fundamental utility bitcoin applies to its users' liberty.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:23:16
that sounds all good.
if you are going to invest an above-average amount into bitcoin due to an above-average interest in bitcoin,
be sure to make friends that have bitcoin, 
because bitcoin is considered a very high risk endeavor with regards to personal finance. if you wear these decisions on your sleeve like i do, 
be a responsible bitcoin evangelist. 
other than that, i can relate to your strategy; i used student loans to invest early in bitcoin, though at the time i was practicing a much more prudent personal finance, and so i wasn't as heavy-in as retrospect would have wished.
another point that i like to make to people is: don't be afraid to spend a little bitcoin. i don't mean selling, i mean spending. there are usually at least a couple ways to spend some bitcoin whether its coffee or music or something, 
it is healthy for the bitcoin economy. 
better yet, if you offer a good or service, or have an entrepreneurial bent, consider accepting bitcoin as payment.

Yes dynamic fees are enabled now. I believe these transactions were sent using an older version of Electrum where I did not use dynamic fees.
