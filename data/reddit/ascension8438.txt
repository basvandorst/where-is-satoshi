I agree that it's bullshit.
Weed is illegal in most places but if someone wants to break the law and smoke weed, they're taking a small risk to do so and should understand that.  I think that it should be legal everywhere but I'm just focusing on the individual's choice and risk associated with that.
If you're selling BTC for USD on Coinbase though and trying to not pay taxes on it, that's just really foolish.  Like smoking a joint in front of the police station.

This statement is ludicrous.  I would guess that he knows about as much about Bitcoin as he does about impulse control.

This was a good video.
Most videos that are "looking at charts" set my bullshit detector off going wild, but this seemed like a very sensible video.  Of course it helps that it was essentially confirming my preconceived notions to the max.  The only ideas about price predictability which I hold in high regard and have confidence in, is the 4-year cycle of Bitcoin.   I attribute it to the halving.
@_date: 2019-07-10 10:08:09
Probably a bit of a stretch to say that his debate skills are "very good"... Sure you won't make a dent in his opinion, but it's just because he's too stubborn to recognize strong and valid points when they're made against him.   Not to mention vice versa - he will make stupid and hypocritical points and think he just scored a slam dunk.
I'll pass on this video.  Schiff is extremely exhausting to listen to, he just repeats the same tired talking points over and over.  It's like watching a 10 minute cable news discussion stretched to 1-2 hours.

You are REALLY giving him the benefit of the doubt.  There's a bit more meat to it than you're suggesting:
Not to mention he has literally admitted himself to walking into women's dressing rooms unannounced because he wants to "accidentally" see them naked.
Many of the same people who believe (or at least act like they believe) that Donald Trump has a good and decent history of sexual conduct are the same people who believe Hillary Clinton was running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizzeria basement (which by the way doesn't even have a basement).  That just proves to me that people will deny the most obviously credible stories if they like the person accused, while at the same time believing the most comically unlikely bullshit smear campaigns against people that they dislike.

I've been into Bitcoin since like 2013/2014ish, and even I do not have a lightning wallet on my phone ready to pay for any groceries.  Best I could do is on-chain transaction at a moments notice.
It's cool that it's going in this direction though.  Just makes me laugh to imagine if they actually went forward with it at this point in time.

Is it possible that this graph is misleading?  The only data point which is truly out of the normal range is the last one... is it possible that each data point represents an average of say a few days or a week, but the final data point only has enough data from a fraction of that time bucket?
I see this kind of shit all the time at work.... charting algorithms will dive bomb at the end of the graph just because of timing when the chart is generated, not because of the actual data.
Just asking a question.
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:33:25
Hahaha, oh boy.... it's deja vu on the old "is it priced in??" discussion of the last halvening.
It definitely was NOT priced in, but I agree that it's possible the effects could definitely occur earlier this time due to awareness.  Bitcoin is a much bigger beast now.

Yup, about $20-25k is a sweet spot for a car for most people.  I got a 2 year old Acura TL for about $21k, and it's amazing and was in near perfect shape and will last a very long time.  Maybe go up to $30k if you need something special like an SUV.
Spend much more than that and you're just wasting money.  I live in Atlanta, and I swear half the people here are killing themselves financially to drive the nicest cars that they can possible afford, and probably are in massive debt (I'm not).  I'm not kidding, in many neighborhoods here it seems like more than half of the cars are luxury tier and brand new.... Lexus, Acura, BMW, Mercedes... where I grew up it was pretty rare to see even one of those cars out in the wild.

Cryptocurrency is not a genre.  We're just making analogies anyway, it's nothing literal... but it makes no sense to say Tool is underrated.
People who either don't care about hard rock or actively dislike it don't really matter... they are guaranteed not to like Tool, so nobody who actually likes Tool is going to care about their opinion.
But regardless.... hard rock is not an underrated genre!  That makes me laugh.  Again, you continue pushing the meaning of the word until it means almost nothing.  Almost all of Tool's albums have gone multi platinum.  If we're going to use the word underrated for a band like this, we can say it about Metallica.  We can say it about AC/DC.  Like yeah, these bands just ain't getting the credit they deserve... (lol!)  So why would we even say it if it means nothing?

Exactly.  Money in a bank account is not easily "stealable" by your average street thug.

No, that is not the best rule in my opinion.  This is better:
1. Sell when you cannot fucking believe how high the price has gone.
2. Buy when you cannot fucking believe how low the price has gone.
And most people literally do the opposite of that, which is kind of hilarious.

I know this post looks kind of dumb, but you'd be surprised at how sophisticated the scamming can be.
I have been on Tinder lately, and doing decently with it.  One day this girl from Singapore matches with me and we start chatting it up.  She mentions that she is going to be in the USA in a few months, and I figure it doesn't hurt to talk.  We go back and forth for a couple of days but then the conversation just kind of fizzles out.
Like a week later, she made an update to her profile and so it shows up in my feed, and she had some comment in there about cryptocurrency which wasn't there before.  I am not a moron, I understand there is an incredibly high probability of scamming, but there's definitely a part of my brain thinking "hmm, this hot girl is into things that I'm into and I hadn't even realized it... neat!".
So I hit her back up and mention the crypto.  She latched onto it hard, and is talking about how her relatives work for banks, and there is this new coin coming out which is going to be HUGE and the bank is going to buy it and it will 20x.  She was sending me photos on WhatsApp that she supposedly took that weekend of her at a cryptocurrency conference.  I just have to go to this shitty website which has a revoked SSL certificate and even works on unencrypted http, and I can load up on the coin there.
I was entertained by it, and then started ignoring her.  The texts continued to come in almost daily from her.  I muted her and just ignored it and they eventually stopped.
I'm not about to get scammed, I have a good skeptical mind, but I could see some people being taken in by this kind of thing.  It's impressive level scamming.

Imagine if I wanted to give you a bunch of numbers... and then I give you the sum as well to make sure we didn't fuck up any of those numbers.  So like...


And that's the only numbers that you truly need for your purposes, but I also give you this number to make certain that we didn't make a mistake:
You can add all of your numbers together on your side, and if they don't equal 139, we know that we screwed up and should try again from the beginning.
That's just a super simple example to convey the concept.  In reality of course, the checksum of a bitcoin address is integrated right into the address, and I believe it uses much more complex math.

I don't even see how their names are similar.  One is Greek and the other is Lebanese.  Yeah, I guess they are both very foreign sounding if you're from the United States, but come on.
They really don't cover the same ground anyway.  Andreas is 100% focused on the technical side in most of his work, whereas Saifedean is more focused on the economics, and they're both primarily studied in those respective fields (Andreas in CS and Saif in economics).  If anything they complement each other.
Like what, a guy with a foreign sounding name can't become popular or else he must be copying this other guy with a foreign sounding name?  This post is hilarious.  Are you suggesting that Saif made up his name recently and legally changed it just to be more like Andreas?  Are you suggesting that he isn't genuinely passionate about the topic?  He is an economics professor.

I agree.  Eventually it will go insanely high again but I bet it takes a while.
If you look at this original post image, what jumps out to me is that the "ballpark" price seems to change drastically in 4 year intervals.  It makes sense to me that the halvenings occur, and then with some lag, the price goes parabolic.  So if next halvening is 2020, maybe we see the price jump high in 2021 if we follow the idea in this image.

I hate to say it but, my first thought was "is this a joke?".... and actually I'm still wondering that.
First verse he literally rhymed Bitcoin with itself 4 times.  The fuck?  All of the lyrics sound like they're just ad-libbed on the first take.
The beat just sounds weak and lazy, and so does he.  I'm still wondering, is this ACTUALLY a famous rapper or just someone parodying him?

Watching Roger argue is like witnessing the quintessential example of what is meant by the term "bad faith".  He just tries to brute force hurl as many inane arguments at them as he can, hoping that just something will do damage.  The only times that he grants his opponent any credit in their arguments at all, it's in a backhanded fashion.
He is not trying to learn anything, or to clearly see the other point of view, he's just trying to win the argument by any means possible (and he can only win if his opponent is even less technically inclined than he is).   His tactics are consistently childish, and resemble a tantrum of a child attempting to outsmart his mother to get his own way.

It's very unclear without context and such, I agree.
I think the idea though is the cups are attached by string.  He wanted marbles from the one guy but didn't have a direct connection to him, so the payment was routed through the other guy.  The marbles can travel wherever there is string.  The guy in the middle gives marbles but he also received marbles so he is just as well off.

It all depends entirely on how you're securing your coins.  Some people have paper wallets, some hardware wallets... some store on their phone, some right on the exchange.  Some 2FA, some might not even be using a PIN or password.
Regardless of those details, it's a fact that stealing crypto is very common.   People might find it difficult to steal YOUR coins, and MY coins.  But there are lots of poorly secured coins out there, ripe for the taking regardless.
Not to mention ripe for the scamming.  Btw please send me 5 eth and I'll send you back 100 eth.

Yup, title was very wrong.

I know, right?  It's only worth around 9k right now.  Why bother buying such a low value coin when you could just wait and get far more valuable coins down the line instead?
@_date: 2018-10-05 09:42:58
Nice strawman.  Anyone is allowed to participate in Bitcoin, but if you want to loudly make technical arguments against the developers, a technical background would be nice.

Great that they are implementing it, but they're so late that it probably doesn't matter much at this point... most people who care have already moved on.

@_date: 2018-10-18 18:56:09
The outcome of another crisis in terms of Bitcoin's fate would be determined by the aggregate behaviors of everyone on the planet.
I'd love to think that everyone will all of a sudden become convinced that Bitcoin would serve us better and make the switch, but I highly doubt that would happen.  Bitcoin is perceived as weird and risky to most people right now, if they even know what it is in the first place.   That does not change overnight, ESPECIALLY during a disaster.
Bitcoin can only protect against these events when it itself is *already* strong and ubiquitous.  We're just not there yet though.  It will take a long time.
@_date: 2018-10-19 13:09:10
I know that I sure did.... and I got in early by today's standards, but not early by other standards.
What if you had a paper wallet with a couple thousand Bitcoins on it, but at the time you acquired them they were worth only a few cents?  I'd want to test the wallet out at some point for sure.  But yeah, I think that's the scenario OP is talking about.
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:23:28

@_date: 2018-10-24 10:26:09
Yeah, fully agreed on that.  It was a very unprofessional and just plain bizarre digression.  And I even mostly agreed with his opinion, just thought it was out of place and strange.
Although I'm not sure I agreed with his assertion that bad art is basically caused by bad money.  Maybe that's why it seems so out of place.

@_date: 2019-10-17 20:15:18
People were discussing it being priced in last time too.  A thousand posts just like yours exactly 4 years ago.
It looks to me like they ended up being wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:59:03
He is weird as fuck, and very arrogant....
But I'll be damned if his price predictions aren't pretty fucking solid, and he's just plain fun to listen to.

Damn.... for real?  That's brutal if so.
@_date: 2019-08-12 10:37:22
Exactly... It's ok to be skeptical, but this was just empty skepticism.
He had nothing intelligent to offer on the topic, just the same knee-jerk reaction that any common person has when they hear about Bitcoin but haven't learned anything about how it works yet or why it exists.  They may as well have just taken to the streets and asked random people the same questions.
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:47:15
What in the fuck are you even talking about...
He shared a podcast, who cares.  Calm your tits.
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:57:07
Right, it's an estimate.  Why are so many people thinking it can be perfectly predicted?
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:03:17

@_date: 2019-10-26 15:14:32
Yup, I was seriously considering buying some more BTC these past couple of weeks, but didn't.....  Boooo...
@_date: 2019-10-05 13:57:22
Everyone was saying exactly what you are saying 4 years ago with the previous halvening.  But that was not what I witnessed when it happened.
What seems to happen is that it rises up bigtime about 3-6 months both before and after the event.  That's how it has historically seemed to play out.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:40:14
Nothing is "100% definitely" in Bitcoin.  But many people (myself included) think it's likely that the price goes much higher due to the halving.
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:06:34
Yeah, what a bunch of absolute shit "journalism".
It's because of garbage like this that we now live in an absolute shitstorm of misinformation in 2019.... and it probably will just get worse.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:56:57
Probably, but I at least think that the halving is likely to cause some action in a predictable way.
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:44:34
I don't really follow.... is it far fetched that he was saying that and people disagreed/laughed?
It's not like he said he sold all his bitcoin at exactly the peak and bought back in at exactly the bottom, and then banged Scarlett Johansson.

Haven't listened to this episode yet, but I have to agree.  I just recently subscribed.
So many Bitcoin podcasts are just *incredibly* boring for most of their episodes... I do hate to say it.
I've enjoyed every episode that I've heard of this show though.

It would be 21 bitcoin, but yeah.  We know a lot of those are lost forever.

You literally asked him to click it, and even furthermore asked him to provide feedback, with your original post:


Doesn't seem like you appreciated the bad feedback very much.  You should change your original post... something like "good feedback is appreciated, but any bad feedback and I will turn into a whiny little bitch"
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:05:18
I mean they admit that they don't understand the technicals, they just think they know enough that they can have a meaningful opinion on it.  I disagree with that, but yeah.
I don't think it's outright fraud, many people have opinions on shit that they barely understand, it doesn't make them frausters.  Those guys really do believe in their hearts that Bitcoin will fail.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:17:47
Yup... it's a stupid title, because so many people have bought *and sold at a lower price,* so they're not in profit.  Not saying they didn't make a bad decision by doing so, I'm just saying that to propose this concept in this way is misleading.
Makes it sounds like "98% of people who have bought Bitcoin are in profit!".
In reality, it's probably more like 80% of people who have bought Bitcoin have lost their fucking ass because they sold at a loss.

I don't think that making a backup will ward off any attackers.  I get what you're saying, if you have your phone stolen then there is a chance that you can move the coins to another address before the attacker, but still.
Bottom line, I am comfortable storing about $200 on my phone and nothing more than that, even without a hardware key storage solution.  This doesn't really increase the amount I'm comfortable storing on a phone, to be honest.  I'll just continue to store most of my crypto in a Ledger and Trezor.
Not trying to complain though honestly, I think this is great news and I wish more phones had this feature.

Eh... that's just kind of dumb to be honest.  If I had "never sold", I'd be much less well off right now.  (student loan went poof)
My policy is this:
* Sell Bitcoin when you cannot fucking believe how high the price has gone.
* Buy Bitcoin when you cannot fucking believe how low the price has gone.
Has served me well enough so far.  What's really amazing though is that most people literally do the opposite of that advice, because of the psychological aspects of it when you're actually invested/involved in the market, i.e. morale.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:27:08
Ok, I'm still not understanding what you're saying.  You want corporate taxes over 50%.... But roads and firemen will still be pay per use under this paradigm?  Where does the tax revenue go then?
I mean obviously like most people in this sub, we fully agree that crypto capital gains tax should not exist.  But I'm having trouble putting the sum of your statements into a coherent worldview.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:10:35
It's hard to say.... I definitely was not expecting this to rally so much in 2019.  Was thinking it would be 2020 because of the halving.
But honestly the second time we broke $1k I was shocked as well, and it blew right the fuck past that and more.  The rallies are almost always shocking to behold.

@_date: 2019-02-22 20:59:06
Dude, this whole thing is basically a zero-sum game unless it reaches total global dominance.  The only thing that makes the price go up is more people entering the market and buying.  If you never sell, why do you even care about the price if you'll never reap what you've sown?
@_date: 2019-02-02 13:17:31
What is this paranoid, it's a conspiracy against Bitcoin bullshit?
The video is up.  Probably there was just some technical issue.  It never ceases to amaze me how people will immediately jump to conspiracy... as if every trivial bad thing that has ever happened is caused by some intentional and deliberate action on the part of someone evil.
Sometimes conspiracies happen, but usually not.  Think it through more next time.

You have to take a little profit every now and then, Jesus Christ people.
Don't sell the entire stack. Just sell some, especially if you have something useful to spend it on, and maybe sell a little extra too in hopes to buy it back after a dip.
Buy when you can't believe how low the price is.
Sell when you can't believe how high the price is.
That's been my motto.

Meh.  So far the only documented successful cases of a cryptocurrency fulfilling any truly useful role of any kind is as store of value / money.  All of the other potential use cases are just theoretical and haven't really been shown to be useful.
Ethereum is just a freight train overloaded to the brim with shitcoins.
I'm open to it but, I don't see any useful altcoins out there.  (maybe Monero, but that's it, and BTC will certainly have similar privacy on higher layers eventually anyway)

Yeah, I get how Bitcoin and private keys work.
What I'm saying is, suppose that you have a few thousand USD in value of Bitcoin, or even a few million... where do you want to store your keys?  On your phone that you carry with you every day?  You'd have to be insane.
So I'm saying that while this is cool, it wouldn't change my comfort level really at all with how much crypto I'm willing to carry around every day in my phone.

What really drives me nuts is when people point to the utility of gold as it relates to electronics and computers.

@_date: 2019-06-27 10:10:38
This is what I want.  Congrats to you, man.
People talking about lambos and shit. My buddy at work telling me I need to buy a Tesla because I think they're cool and can afford it.
Fuck that.  My only focus is on early retirement.  If I blew every dollar that I made on frivolous shit then I'd never be able to retire and get my life/time back.
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:41:24
Litecoin... what about it?  It's just exactly the same thing with different block times.
Brave is nice, I'm actually using the Brave browser and really like it.  But I'd prefer if it were done instead on Bitcoin via lightning.  I suspect some day this will be the case.
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:29:39
I mean, if you're giving a gift to someone who doesn't trust you, or you don't trust yourself, yeah... I guess...
Seems like a reasonable safeguard against a likely scenario to me though.  They might not be interested in the crypto on the day you give it to them, but a few years later if it's worth 10x as much, they might start to get interested and then not have the key.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:14:10
I think that he's attributing the Libra announcement to the price increases...
But I do think that's foolish as the price was slowly rising since far before the announcement.  People always try to connect the dots from news to price movement and it's rarely solid ground in my opinion.  We don't know wtf is going on with the price.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:58:02

That's obviously what I was responding to.

I've restored the same seed phrase to a Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, Mycelium and Coinomi.  It all worked as I recall.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:23:29
The difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks to a value which makes the blocks happen approximately every 10 minutes.  Difficulty will go up or down if necessary, to reach that correct balance.
Halving happens every 4 years though, and it only goes in one direction.  The block rewards are cut in half.  The difficulty doesn't really interact with that. Difficulty will continue to keep a balance of happening  every 10 minutes, but the rewards for those blocks will get cut in half and never go back up.  This means fewer brand new coins entering the market, which means they're more rare, and presumably will trade at a higher value.
@_date: 2019-12-07 11:12:08
Well that first paragraph is jam packed with a bunch of wacky shit.  Are you saying these are straight up lies about him?


@_date: 2019-12-07 14:18:40
Yeah totally agree.  Peter wasn't making himself look very good in that one.  And Richard is just a very strong talker and debater with good technical knowledge so he definitely stomped him.... But that doesn't mean Hex isn't a scam either, just means he's a powerful debater.
Richard probably could win a flat Earth debate against Peter from the perspective of the Earth being flat, just because he's good at talking circles around people.

Eh... seems kind of cringy to me.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:17:10
This reminds me of when the price had peaked from Mt. Gox, and everyone was thinking we'd be lucky to even reach that price again.
As it usually seems to turn out in Bitcoin though, hitting a previous all time high after a long bear market is usually when things just *start to* get crazy, and the price shoots up from there.
I think that before and after the halvening in 2020 is going to be some crazy fucking shit in terms of price.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:14:42
Isn't that a bit of a bad sign though?
It shot up like crazy in an extremely short timespan.... doesn't seem like a healthy, steady, strong rally forming.  Seems like it could even be the result of actions from a single person to me.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:46:32
Yup, came in to say similar... fuck this guy.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:56:21
Hahah, I remember all of this talk!
So many people were absolutely convinced that it was priced in, and so many others convinced of the opposite.
There appears to be some latency between the halvening and the effects on price shooting upward, but it seems pretty clear to me that it is an ACTUAL  event which has an effect on the price, unlike so many other news items which are discussed ad nauseum but don't end up making any impact.
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:38:56

This is a nice goal for cryptocurrency, and I'm sure we'll get there someday.... but you have to admit that in the meantime, there are just as many or more headaches and points of friction in crypto.
Fuck I have to sign up for Coinbase... shit they need me to wait for verification.  Ok it's 2 weeks later and I'm verified... now the transaction fees have gone up astronomically.  Shit, my transaction is not confirmed.  Ahh fuck, the price just shot up 5% within a single hour, I wish I waited before making this purchase.... etc, etc...
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:26:33
Ok, yeah that makes sense.  And I agree with the McAfee assessment as well.
@_date: 2019-04-19 23:55:07
I was entertained with the notion that Donald Trump might even have "thoughts" that he would be able to share on cryptocurrency.  If asked, it would just be his usual incoherent rambling, like a 6th grader bullshitting his way through a book report for a book that he didn't read.
I wonder if the Queen of England has shared her thoughts on nuclear propulsion.
And no, I wouldn't expect just about any of the people in the image to have a well formed opinion on crypto, but the difference with Trump is that it doesn't matter, he will still bullshit about it because he is incapable of admitting to ignorance.
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:31:13
Yeah, that's basically what I think as well.... but hey, eventually it does seem to randomly shoot up and stay there, over the long term.
I've not done any trading recently, so I'm up whatever percentage Bitcoin happens to be up this year so far... but up almost 10x since I first got into it, with student loans eliminated as a bonus.  Can't complain.
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:57:47

No, advertising in the real physical world that you have tons of Bitcoin is a very bad idea.  It sets you up for getting your ass kidnapped and having the shit beaten out of you for your BTC.
If you have lots of money in a bank account or if you have a nice car, people would love to steal it but they won't because they'd probably get caught.  With Bitcoin on the other hand, it's far more likely that you could manage to get away with it, given the irreversible transactions and the potential for hiding your tracks with various methods.

Oh my god, I am so tired of seeing this argument pop up.
No offense to you, but just think about it for a minute.  How long have we had electronics, 150 years?  Especially such fine electronics where the properties of gold would offer truly useful benefit?
And for how long has gold been considered valuable?  Oh right, probably longer than recorded human history.
The value of gold is primarily derived from uses in jewelry, which is a niche that it fills due to its unique luster/aesthetic, excellent corrosion resistance, difficulty/impossibility of counterfeiting, and just plain scarcity.  That's pretty much it, you can probably stop there.  For 99% of human history, people coveted gold above almost all else and didn't even know what electricity was.
The utility in electronics is nice, but take that property away and the price would be roughly the same.

The new Bitcoin which comes into existence every 10 minutes is cut in half.
It's just a simple supply/demand dynamic.  Remember what happened to the prices of hard drives, when a tsunami struck Thailand, where most of the world's hard drives were being produced?  They got a lot more expensive for a long time.  If supply goes down while demand remains the same, price goes up.

That's kind of true, but we all need houses or some kind of shelter to live in.  
Bitcoin on the other hand.... it's not exactly a fundamental need.  That's not to say that it won't reach some profound potential in the future, but we have to look at right now sometimes and be honest.
Right now, Bitcoin is being used for almost nothing except for pure speculation.  Sure, some people are buying things online with it, some people are sending money to their families with it... but 95%+ of people are just trading and hodling.  We are not at the potential yet.... like Bitcoin could just disappear tomorrow and the biggest impact would be people thought they were rich on paper and now they aren't... but society would continue on with barely a hiccup.

You must be referencing yourself, I'm guessing?
Here is what you said:


If the "never go back under $10K" happens during the 2018 bear market, this implies that it never goes back under $10K after that time.
In much of 2019 - the year 2019 being the year which comes AFTER 2018 in case you need the help understanding - the price was under $10K.  Therefore what you said is false.

Yeah man, I like this post.  I was thinking along these lines just this morning.
With stocks, there are many factors like, is this company going to release a clever new product, or will they make a huge error and flop this year?  Or will they suffer some awful PR through no actual fault of their own?  So many possibilities.  So many seemingly minor factors that can have huge effect.
But cryptocurrency might be different in a sense.  And if so this will be far more obvious in the future aided by hindsight.... but crypto seems like it might be much more fundamental than critics give it credit for.  It is not a company.  What if in the grand timeline of human existence, cryptocurrency is a fundamental discovery?  Inevitable, and almost guaranteed to catch on once discovered, just like fire, or flight.  What if cryptocurrency, a rare digital asset, is something that the world just needs right now.
For example when electricity was finally discovered and understood, there were details to iron out.  AC vs DC, and challenges and scathing criticisms of all kinds.  But in hindsight, we can see that all of those details were of little importance.  Electricity was destined to catch on, and there was no way to stop it even if you tried.
Very broad technologies like electricity or flight or cellphones seem inevitable and perhaps guaranteed to catch on, while very specific technologies like betamax and HD-DVD and rotary engines do not come with guarantees.
So anyway, maybe crypto is an inevitable success right now (perhaps 99% chance of success), and Bitcoin is the frontrunner (perhaps 80-90% chance).

To be fair, most of those uses of gold don't really contribute to the value of it, with the exception of jewelry.  Gold was similarly worth the highest of value before we knew that we could do 90% of the things in that list with it.  It's mostly valuable because it's shiny, rare and hard to fake.

Right.  When it comes to taking on risk, there are two main questions to ask:
What are the odds?
What are the stakes?
Taking out a loan to invest in something is very, very rarely a good idea.  Even if you do it successfully, it was still reckless behavior.  The stakes are too high.  Even if the odds are pretty good, if you fucked it up you might have fucked up your entire life.  To take out the loan means that the amount of money involved was not trivial to you since you didn't even have it in the first place.

Honestly it probably can't hurt.
I sold some BTC and paid off my student loan when BTC price was $10k on the way up in the last bull run.  I also sold a little bit extra and used that to buy back later.   It's basically the only time that I've ever done anything besides HODL and it worked out incredibly well for me, although you better believe that I was a little distraught when we hit $20k, thinking that I should have waited just a couple weeks.
My point is, don't ever expect to sell at the tippy top.  It won't happen.  Just be glad to take some profit when you have a chance.  Don't be a perfectionist about it.

Again, you are barely reading half of the words that I said, and filling in the blanks with nonsense.
I am not talking about fractional reserve.  I am talking about technical problems... either on the blockchain or on the exchange themselves.  You don't implement a technology infrastructure assuming that all of your customers are going to slam you at exactly the same time.  Amazon for example I'm sure has many millions of customers, but would grind to a halt if all of those customers tried to submit an order at the same time.  That doesn't make them evil, or liars... it's just the practical limitations of running a business.

This is the next halvening?
The last halvening is really what I was watching for to see some crazy price action.  It did NOT disappoint, though there was quite a bit of lag before the price went apeshit.

Maybe just supposed to be a joke.... Not having to use a condom is pretty sweet actually.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:47:52
I find the "proof of keys" concept to be interesting.... but it does sound like a potential technical nightmare for people, maybe losing coins if the exchange gets all fucked up, and/or if the blockchain itself cannot handle the transactions due to poor scaling.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:05:07


Buddy, we're talking about what happens if Bitcoin does NOT succeed, and you argue against that with "won't matter when Bitcoin hits $50k!".
Sure though, you can ruin your credit.  I've had bad credit before myself, and depending on the circumstance it might not really affect your life by much.  I was fine then, and I'm more than fine now.  (had bankruptcy when I was in early 20's, am mid-30's now)
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:54:36
Most of my Bitcoin was purchased for about $570 per BTC.   I ate shit and was underwater for quite some time after that purchase.  
But I never sold until $10,000 per BTC on the way up (paid the student loan off with a small portion of my holdings).  Still holding on to basically all of it though.

She's clearly gorgeous, lmao... are you trying to impress us with your "high standards"?

Does anybody know when this was added?
In the previous thread, people were bitching that this was added like 3 years ago.
While the symbol is there in Excel on my home computer, I don't see it on my work computer.  The work computer is less frequently updated, but it should be up to date within the past year or so for sure.
So I'm not clear on when this happened.....

@_date: 2018-12-17 16:48:15
Who are you kidding?  He is the "acting" Chief of Staff... he was just shoved in as a short term solution to ending Trump's humiliation at the fact that people were turning down the position and he couldn't fill it.
Mick also said that Trump is a terrible human being.
I doubt he'll be in the position for more than a few months.
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:32:38
Personally I think that holding indefinitely and never selling is pretty stupid.  I would assume most people think that.
When your investment is up 1,000% or something, you better god damned sell some of it, just so that no matter what happens from that point you can't regret it too much.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:15:43
The real problem is when people like you can only view others through the lens of "us vs them" and ascribe to "them" all of these insane motivations for which there is no evidence.
I don't like Steve Bannon, and I don't know who Daniel Pipes is... but to say that Sam and Jordan are guilty of hate speech, racism and xenophobia is ludicrous.

Yeah, in my opinion it was almost toooo easy.  Wish I had sold more when the price was near the last ATH.  If I hadn't had a student loan to pay off, I wonder if I would have cashed in at all.
I think that your own personal financial health and position in life must play into this as well though.  I live very comfortably, but just 10-15 years ago I was struggling a lot with money.  I might have been tempted to sell a lot more if this stuff was going on back then.

It is not the truth.  You sound like a conspiracy paranoid high schooler who has never worked an actual job with an actual company before.
The point that I'm making is simply that slamming the exchanges all at the same time could be a technical challenge that they are not prepared for.  Not because they're evil, but because you'd be unreasonable to deploy such infrastructure in the first place.
When you're running a business, you have finite resources and you have to use them strategically to satisfy the customers, while not spending so much that you put yourself out of business or allow the competitor to crush you.
It is possible that everyone withdrawing at the same time would be devastating for the exchanges and even for the blockchains.  That's not because of a mustache twirling evil agenda to enslave the populace... it's just their infrastructure not being up to the task.
I work in IT Ops and sometimes things go horribly wrong and we have to solve technical problems.  It's just because a technical infrastructure is hard to manage, and unexpected things can happen.  Not evil... only a naive kid would make that assumption.

Yes exactly, same here.  I hadn't bought anything since like 2015.... until now.
My motto is this:
* Sell some crypto when you cannot fucking believe how high the price has become.
* Buy some crypto when you cannot fucking believe how low the price has become.
Anything in between those two extremes is probably much more risky behavior.

But the Earth \*is\* just a dot, in that context.  It's called perspective.  It can teach us things about how we fit into this universe.
Similarly, zooming out on a Bitcoin price graph can offer a lot of perspective that people are not seeing because all they can focus on right now is the price in the past 1-2 years.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:36:34
That's a pretty big chunk of silver, though.
Everyone knows that "silver and gold" are highly valuable and are the most common metals used for jewelry.  I don't know how a person makes it to adulthood not learning that a big chunk of silver is worth a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:31:28
Exactly.  I don't understand how people can't see this for what it is.
Bitcoin goes 20x in price, and everyone here just accepts it... then it goes back down and into a bear market and THAT is the thing that has everyone scratching their heads?  Come on, guys... I was just waiting for the price to go back down.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:59:56
Hahah, that's what struck me as well.
This article wasn't just a comment here that is ridiculous, a comment there which is a bit off the mark, some reasonable statements.
No, this article was impressively wrong and non-prophetic.  Like you have to question if this was even written in 1995.... you almost need present day knowledge to make so many consistently wrong predictions about the internet (as a joke).  Everything he said the internet is bad at, it turned out to be incredible at.
I wonder what this guy is up to today.  If he has any Bitcoin price predictions, it might be fun to bet against them and become rich.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:03:05
It makes me laugh but it's so true.  Buy high, sell low!
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:51:18


Right.  I say perspective, you say perception... we are saying the same damned thing.  The point is that you can look at things from different angles and gain wisdom this way.
Nobody is saying that if you zoom out it changes the underlying data.  Nobody is saying that if you zoom out, you'll turn your losses into gains.  (yes, it is true that I have taken more USD out of the system than I've put in, and my gains are all house money at this point... I am fortunate to not be in the red like many people)
You're just missing the point in a hard-headed way.  The point is that Bitcoin absolutely tanked in 2018.... yet it has grown astronomically since its inception.  That doesn't mean that it will continue up.... just that short term nose dives of the price are typical in Bitcoin, and long term growth has been consistent.

I'm suggesting that the exchange could experience severe technical problems, EVEN if they do have the bitcoin, if thousands and thousands of users all try to withdraw their coins simultaneously.
And if they experience such problems and downtime, there would likely be users who end up having lost their bitcoin one way or another... there is always fallout.
