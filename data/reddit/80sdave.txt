Hahah. That’s ridiculous! She could have retired and gone shopping for the rest of her life.

No selling anything?
Surely something to buy more back in?
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:03:54
Did that include any unconfirmed transactions sitting around from the MB wallet?

I had to turn my alerts off... going absolute mad.
My 6k alert was to sell out.
And my below 5500k alert was to buy back in.
Now why can’t I stick to that???

Can only figure out away to export the transaction history. Do I have a copy of the password string tho.
Thanks for your help.

Yeh. I keep some safe in Coinbase. Just in case I f**k up the other methods (until it upskilled).
When’s Coinbase starting to hold of transactions due to fork?

That’s what they said about Multibit and keepkey a while back - and I’m in a massive pickle right now..

Sorry to be a pain. What’s best way to check the the addresses on the block explorer? And even after checked - how can I get them confirmed?

Ahh. I’m on version  0.5.1
Need to upgrade??
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:07:15
So you’re saying you’d even buy in right now too...
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:06:31
Ok. BUT if you sell out now. Your wealth drops for a bit. Assume it’s an earn more expense..
And by MORE BTC with the earnings after a small dip. How’s conflicting your ideas?
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:48:30
For those viewers.
Perhaps nows the best  time to buy in.
Get in when you’re in top:)
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:58:20
I said I’d wait for a 40% dip.... still waiting.
Buy in now if you’re still serious 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:59:12
Seriously??  Where can I find instructions!
