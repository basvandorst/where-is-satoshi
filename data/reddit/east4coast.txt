The site doesn't even enforce HTTPS by default. Not a good sign.

"Bitcoin users" is becoming a larger and larger group. Why won't most users just go with what the government tells them to do? The ideological minority that started bitcoin is just that, a minority.

It seems to me that many people have a hard time making a distinction between:
* LAWS. Doing justice. "You shall not infringe on other people's person or property. If you do, you shall be punished." You can't rape, steal, murder, etc. Ron Paul is all for LAWS. If Mark Karpeles is shown in court to have committed fraud, Ron Paul is all for Karpeles having to pay fines and/or go to jail.
* REGULATIONS. Arbitrary mandates that have nothing to do with justice. "All bitcoin exchanges shall do XYZ or its operators will be punished." This is an arbitrary rule forced on people who have not defrauded anyone. Ron Paul is against this.
It's not very hard to understand.

If you are not for a single world government, the rest pretty much follows:
"And once one concedes that a single world government is not necessary, then where does one logically stop at the permissibility of separate states? If Canada and the United States can be separate nations without being denounced as being in a state of impermissible “anarchy,” why may not the South secede from the United States? New York State from the Union? New York City from the state? Why may not Manhattan secede? Each neighborhood? Each block? Each house? Each person? But, of course, if each person may secede from government, we have virtually arrived at the purely free society, where defense is supplied along with all other services by the free market and where the invasive State has ceased to exist."
-- Murray Rothbard, Power and Market, 1970

Can you please create a service where you can RECEIVE sms also? I've been searching for one but can't find one where you can pay with bitcoin.
Yes, I know about the free services out there, but the problem is too many people use the same number. Eventually, companies ban such numbers because they've been used too often, so you have to buy new numbers.
I haven't found a service where I can buy new numbers WITH BITCOIN, so that ONLY ME use that number for receiving SMS.

BitMessage is a doomed project IMO.
* It is not scalable.
* It also takes over a minute to send a single message on it. This essentially rules out ordinary people using it. People want stuff to happen instantly. Over a minute? Forget it.
I hope I'm wrong. Can someone convince me I'm wrong?

Gary North's desperate attempts to "destroy" Bitcoin are becoming embarrassing.

Recently someone found flaws in Blockchain.info's "Shared Coin" send feature.
1. Is Darkwallet any better?
2. Can you choose number of repetitions like in Shared Coin?
3. How is Darkwallet different from Shared Coin?
