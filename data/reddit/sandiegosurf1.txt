No more secrecy,  but at least the Swiss flag is still a big plus.

I guess we assume that the USD is the dominant currency because it is.   What do you think is the dominant global currency?

Let me try to ask my question in a different way.  Bitcoin is worth about $8200 USD now.  For BTC to go to 1 million USD it’s price would have to grow by about 122 times its current price.  What do you think would happen to the price of legacy real estate prices anywhere on earth if Bitcoin’s value grew this much?  Would a million dollar house today be worth ~121 million USD in the future due to hyperinflation of fiat currencies?

1 US Dollar is worth 12,351 Satoshi’s currently.

So the price of one whole Bitcoin is $830” today. That means that you can buy 1/100 of a bitcoin for $83.  This is 1 million Sats.

Each bitcoin is comprised of 100 million Satoshi’s.  So if a bitcoin reached a price of 1 million US dollars,  then each Satoshi’s would be worth 1 US penny.   If each Satoshi’s was worth a dime, then each bitcoin would be worth 10 million dollars.

Yes,  I live and work in the US.  I should note that I have dual citizenship in both the US and the Republic of Ireland.

But what if Bitcoin is a normal medium of exchange for goods and services in 10 years?  Would the Government know if I spent some of my (now very valuable Bitcoin) on a new motorcycle for instance?
