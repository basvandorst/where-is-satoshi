If you think that'll happen why not sell at 7k as well? Then buy more coins with your profits

Basically you have your original Bitcoin, plus a clone of that Bitcoin. After the fork, nobody knows what the value of each will be.

If you have 1 BTC, you will end up with 1 BTC on the main chain and 1 BTC on the 2X chain.

Can you explain what this means to a beginner?

That's a 10% fee. Let's say you make  30% gains on your Bitcoin, you only end up with 20% profit. Try to minimize fees.

What exactly is lightning network?

I wish it were easier to buy on Quadriga

Isn't it the other way around? 2018's price will make today look like a bargain?

I was looking into laptop mining, it's more likely you will overheat your CPU or GPU leading to more costs than you would ever make from mining.

Is it even worth it with transaction fees?

What about a paper wallet? How would that work?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:06:06
Would it make sense to just use a paper wallet instead? It's $140 Canadian here

Would a Trezor or Nano S be sufficient during the coming forks? My coins are on coinbase atm and I'm looking for a wallet to transfer them to

That makes sense, I'm Canadian so I don't think gdax is an option for me. I'm using QuadrigaCX instead
