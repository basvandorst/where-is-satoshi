Typical trader is:  
19k - open long position  
12k - open another long position  
6k - start crying  
3,3k - take profits

Hodl is the best longterm strategy!  
But if you could see overbought moments and sell on highs you will have too many crypto

Of course I can't. It was a joke. Just laughting at people who thought that crypto is the easiest way to multiple money (fomo)  
I am trader too and I agree with your strategy because the mainest thing is you should make your own decisions and don't listen to "experts"
