But that's not the same as saying that it doesn't require much scrutiny. I also do not recall seeing any of the devs say that there will never be a hard fork to increase max block size. Segwit soft fork only offers a less than 4x increase in max block size, and I believe most of the devs recognize that more will be needed eventually.

The benefit is that it effectively allows greater than 1MB blocks (max theoretical block size is 4MB) without requiring a hard fork. It doesn't change the amount of data a fully validating node must download, but it gets around the current limit by a clever reorganization/reclassification of the data, which seems to be much easier and less risky than a hard fork. That is my non-expert understanding.

Every other blockchain token has a more narrow wealth distribution than bitcoin. The vast majority of stocks have a more narrow wealth distribution than bitcoin (and even the most popular stocks are broadly distributed only if you consider collective ownership via mutual funds rather than just direct ownership by individuals and institutions). Gold and silver are more broadly distributed than bitcoin, but other precious metals like platinum and palladium are not. Bitcoin's wealth distribution is definitely not "worse than anything in the world."

What about mining with multiple hash algorithms to decrease centralization? For example, let's say we modify bitcoin so that 1 of every 10 blocks on average needs to be mined with scrypt, while the other 9 of 10 continue to be mined with SHA256. Are there any other coins that use multiple hash algorithms? Obviously SHA256 miners would not like this, but are there other disadvantages to this approach?

Thanks for the reply. Please excuse my layman's understanding, but if you change the entire PoW algorithm, then wouldn't all of the current miners' investments in SHA256 ASICs become entirely worthless, which means there would be much, much more opposition to any change, and wouldn't there be a big drop in security at the moment of the transition to the new algorithm because much less hashing power? Also, I don't understand why it would complicate the production of mining chips, unless you are suggesting that there would be dual-hash algorithm ASICs; I would have thought that ASICs for different hash algorithms would continue to be manufactured separately, as SHA256 and Scrypt ASICs are today. It seems to me that requiring multiple manufacturing processes for bitcoin ASICs would decrease centralisation, not increase it.

He claims "payments systems should meet five criteria: technical efficiency, accessibility and non-discrimination, efficient and cost-based pricing, operational stability with contingency plans in case of problems, and international compatibility" and says "none of new virtual currencies meet those standards."
- Technical efficiency: Bitcoin is faster and more secure; fiat can support greater transaction volume (for now).
- Accessibility and non-discrimination: Bitcoin allows universal access for anyone anywhere with an internet connection; fiat electronic system is accessible only by a fraction of the world, even in higher-GDP countries like the United States, and the cash system is gradually being banned in Europe and the United States.
- Efficient and cost-based pricing: Bitcoin transactions are virtually free; fiat electronic payment systems have ~3% merchant fees, wire transfer fees are 10%+ in many cases, all fiat countries have permanent inflation, many with double-digit inflation.
- Operational stability with contingency plans in case of problems:  the Bitcoin network has a pretty good uptime record and has responded effectively to problems in the past (Ghash 51% threat, etc.); the fiat system only works 5 out of 7 days at best and its contingency plan for problems is tax-payer funded trillion-dollar bailouts or bail-ins, price controls, capital controls, negative interest rates, and other horribly destructive ideas.
- International compatibility: Bitcoin has global compatibility; fiat systems have limited compatibility.

[Full nodes]( are easy to count. Yes, some of them are [fake]( but not most.
I consider "key" devs to be those who do the most/best work on the protocol (Core), wallets (Electrum, Mycelium, BitGo, Blockchain, etc.), and L2 systems (lightning networks, sidechains, TumbleBit, MimbleWimble, etc.). The way they signal is through their own public statements and, more importantly, their code. All of the major wallets are SegWit-ready, or code is a work in progress. Every L2 dev has stated that they want SegWit because it will make L2 better. It's probably impossible to make a precise measurement of dev opinion, but I would estimate it is 95% in favor of SegWit, which is overwhelming consensus according to most people's definition.

I have been very clear that I am not an expert, but one does not necessarily need to be an expert to understand experts' explanations of technical things and then analyze those explanations logically, which is what I try to do. I know for a fact that many bitcoin experts do not think that a planned, non-contentious hard fork is dangerous, and I see a strong logical basis for that opinion. You cite experts that disagree, and they may be right, but to be intellectually honest I try not be swayed by appeals to authority and need to have a strong logical basis for deciding in favor of one argument or another. In this case I see strong logic behind one argument and not so much on the other side.

It's not a problem that they have a different opinion.

This is what they continue to do, so I think it's accurate to call it an attack on Bitcoin.

No, we don't have to replace all cars on the road in order to move to a 100% autonomous vehicle world. The reason is simple. Most cars today are sitting in a garage or parking lot 90% of the time, not on the road. In an autonomous vehicle world, cars are constantly on the move, except for recharging and maintenance. Therefore one autonomous vehicle can serve at least 10X more people, meaning we only need to replace 10% of cars to serve the same number of people.

Ethereum has lost all possibility of ever being considered immutable and censorship-resistant, which means its maximum potential value is far less than it would be if it had not hard forked.

Limited bandwidth would lead to higher orphan rates if the block size were, say, 64MB. But the Chinese miners have all signed on to a letter saying that they have enough bandwidth to support 8MB blocks now, so the reason the max block size is still 1MB has nothing to do with the wishes or technical limitations of the Chinese miners. There are a handful of developers blocking any max block size increase (even just 2MB) for their own reasons which are not based on the current technical capacity of the bitcoin network.

Core should put a firm date for 2MB hard fork in their roadmap; their vague comments about possibly doing a hard fork at an unknown time in the future are interpreted by many people as just another stalling tactic with the real intention being to never increase the max block size. Whether or not Core deserves this level of mistrust is not the issue. The reality is that Core needs to show at least some willingness to compromise if they want to gain back some of the support they have lost. The bigger block side has already compromised a lot, from 20MB to 8MB to 2-4MB and finally to 2MB; I am not aware of a single compromise from the Core side.

The vast majority of ordinary bitcoin users rely on centralized services, which you seem to be implicitly acknowledging will upgrade, or software that automatically updates. Out-of-date non-validating wallets would not be vulnerable to loss as long as the validating node has upgraded, right? So the only ordinary users I can think of who are vulnerable to a hard fork are those using Bitcoin QT or another fully-validating wallet to store their funds. There are not many people who do this, and those who do have significant funds stored in this way are highly likely to upgrade. Is it possible that a few people might fail to upgrade? Yes, but when I try to estimate the number of users and amount of money that will be lost due to failure to upgrade, I concede that the amount may be greater than zero but I do not think it is high enough to be called a significant risk to the bitcoin network. As Jeff Garzik said, doing nothing is a far greater danger to the future of bitcoin than a simple, non-contentious hard fork.

You seem to desire a bitcoin that is not influenced by politics, but the simple fact is that as long as bitcoin exists as a tool to serve humanity there will be politics involved. That is just human nature. So rather than wish for the impossible it is better to just accept that politics will always be involved and learn how to effectively handle political issues. It's not really that complicated; successful government politicians are generally much less intelligent than the influential people in bitcoin, so if those people can master the art of politics so should the people in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-02 17:00:10
That may be true in terms of the technical capacity of bitcoin network, but it's less conservative than 2MB or 2-4-8, and currently there are no options on the table for a one-time increase to 8MB; there is only BIP101/XT, an exponential increase to 8GB, which is clearly not conservative and has been rejected by the majority of miners. I just don't see any logic in insisting on BIP101/XT when a more conservative change has near universal consensus.

What should be even more concerning is that every Bitcoin entity within the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is under the total control the People's Republic of China. That includes mining facilities, ASIC manufacturers, and exchanges. We have already seen the PRC openly seize control of the Chinese exchanges. Full nationalization of all Bitcoin mining in China could happen at any time. There is no reason to think that Jihan/Bitmain is operating independently of the PRC. Even if he is not being coerced now, coercion could begin at any time, and most likely it would be done covertly, so we would have no proof whether Jihan is just being selfish/stupid or being manipulated to destroy Bitcoin by a totalitarian government that is fearful of it. Sadly, there is no tradition of rule of law and property rights in China, so we should not assume that prominent Chinese Bitcoin businesses and individuals are acting of their own free will. I believe most Chinese Bitcoiners are good people and want what's best for Bitcoin, but when people's lives and freedom are at stake, people usually submit to injustice. We definitely should oppose any policy that would centralize more power in China.

I have no doubts about the quality of the devs' work on segwit and will welcome its implementation when they are ready. But I still don't see any strong reason for delaying a 2MB hard fork (I do not find arguments that it is dangerous convincing) or why the hard fork must occur after segwit soft fork. But there are strong reasons against delaying any longer: there is a significant negative effect on bitcoin price and investment, it is fueling a poisonous division in the bitcoin community, and we are wasting so much time and energy on this issue when there are many other great things that could be accomplished.

No, it's not an accounting trick, it's a new data structure. Those that don't want to use SegWit transactions will still benefit from the capacity increase, because those that do use SegWit transactions will use less of the base block space, leaving more space available for non-SegWit transactions, reducing fees for everyone.

Even Core is not opposed to a hard fork, they just want to delay it much longer than the most of industry.

Consider Blockstream's first commercial product: Liquid, "an interoperable sidechain that extends the Bitcoin blockchain while adding an auditable, cryptographically-strong commercial privacy component." ( Liquid's value proposition does not depend on the block size limit being too low. There are already several exchanges working with Liquid, including Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, and Xapo, which is evidence that Blockstream can produce commercially viable products which do not  depend on the bitcoin blockchain's capacity being artificially restricted.
It seems to me that the burden of proof is on those who accuse others of having sinister motivations, and I just haven't seen any evidence to support those accusations against Blockstream. Yes, some of the key individuals involved in Core/Blockstream may have managed some aspects of this scaling process poorly, but that only proves that they are human, not that they are adversaries.
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:49:59


This is a really bad argument. Even if miners receive ten times as much fee revenue due to constricted block size, that would still pale in comparison to the profits that could be gained from price appreciation which would occur when the market gets confident that Bitcoin will scale. So in any rational analysis the incentive for miners to prove to the market that they can scale Bitcoin should outweigh the incentive for them to skim more transaction fees.

I was not arguing about the merits of segwit or accusations of political takeovers, just pointing out that your "larger blocks reduce decentralization" argument does not show that segwit is superior to 2MB hard fork in terms of decentralization because both require the same amount of data to me transmitted among fully-validating nodes. Full nodes will not be any easier to run with segwit.

Don't be disingenuous. There is only one Bitcoin. Right now Core and Classic are both Bitcoin. If/when a 2MB hard fork is activated by 75% hashing power and the rest of the major players in the industry go along with it, then any software which still rejects blocks larger than 1MB would diverge from the real Bitcoin. What Bitcoin is is not determined by a handful of experts, but by the emergent consensus of a huge, diverse global network of participants including miners, exchanges, wallets, merchants, investors, and users.

No, it's based on history. Virtually every country in the world has nationalized key industries at one time or another. Some countries, with strong rule of law and property rights, have a low risk of nationalization; it would only occur in the United States under extreme circumstances. Other countries, like Venezuela and China, are under the rule of regimes which have shown little respect for rule of law and property rights. In those jurisdictions, the likelihood of nationalization or complete shutdown of any business or industry is much higher.


Jihan/Bitmain produce ~70% of the ASICs. Yes, miners who bought Jihan's machines can point their hashing power to any pool they like, unless Jihan threatens that he will not sell them more ASICs in the future unless they use a pool he approves of. For those miners located in China, they also have the threat of government officials ordering them how to mine.


They cracked down hard on exchanges, so why do you think it's improbable that they would ever crack down mining when they see the need?
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:13:15
Imagine a typical Bitcoin miner who calculated that he would earn 5-10 million USD over the next few years. Of course if would be in his interest to protect the value of BTC. But then imagine that a government agent or banker approaches the miner and offers him 20 million USD to raise the block size against user consent, implement KYC/AML blacklists, block SegWit, or take some other action detrimental to short-term and/or long-term success of Bitcoin. Now the miner's personal financial interest is Bitcoin failure, not success. Any government or big bank in the world could afford to bribe or coerce a handful of miners who control most of the hash rate to hurt Bitcoin. We can't just trust that all miners will altruistically do what is best for Bitcoin. We should prevent them from ever obtaining the kind of power that would let them hurt Bitcoin, even if it's unlikely that they ever would.

I would use an offline, air-gapped computer to import the private keys and create and sign a transaction. Then I would move the signed transaction to an online computer to broadcast to the network, my private keys never being exposed to the online computer.

You are mostly correct, although I believe we would see meaningful throughput increase sooner than you think. Even if it does take several months, that's still a lot sooner than a block size limit increase can be deployed, because SegWit is already complete, intensively tested, and compatible with 100% of the Bitcoin network, while there is still no agreement among key developers and businesses about if, how, and when a backwards incompatible fork should be executed, and no sign that consensus on that issue will be reached any time soon.

I think it's 10x better than BU plan. 8MB block size instead of emergent consensus is much more sensible. Merge-mining doesn't force miners to choose. Clearly identifying as a forkcoin and not trying to hijack/kill the original BTC chain makes this much less contentious. One improvement I would suggest is to have SegWit automatically activated in BCL.

The reason to expect price appreciation is not the added value of only 1MB additional capacity, which you are right to say is not a big improvement, but it would prove to the market that Bitcoin is indeed capable of adapting, which right now there is significant doubt about. Eliminating that doubt once and for all would remove a significant source of downward price pressure, from which miners would profit handsomely. Even LN requires a larger block size to be deployed at scale, so that is not an alternative to raising the hard limit.

It's just not intelligent to be advocating BIP101 now, as the Chinese miners and many others will never agree to that. If you want to beat your political opponents, you need to isolate them with as little support as possible. If you draw the line at 2MB, then your obstructionist opponents will have virtually no allies. However, if you draw the line at 8MB with built-in exponential growth, then the Chinese miners and other conservative participants will by default fall on the same side of the debate as the obstructionists because they view no change as preferable to a change they perceive as high risk.

The multiple algorithm idea is interesting, but it still seems to have some of the same flaws. It would fork non-upgraded nodes off the network, which is what we have been trying to avoid all along, and it would still punish the friendly miners, although not as badly as eliminating SHA256 completely.
If the only way to defend against a 51% attack is to hard fork, maybe the answer is an update that would cause all non-SegWit blocks to be rejected. It's still a hard fork that would kick off non-upgraded nodes as well as the attackers, but at least it would not directly affect friendly miners, and we would get SegWit activated as well.

This is a key point on which so many anti-Core folks are either ignorant or dishonest. They fail to even acknowledge that BTC transactions have any real world costs. In their minds transactions aren't free only because evil Core doesn't want them to be free. They see near-zero fees on other coins and wrongly conclude that those have better tech and developers, while missing the obvious fact that altcoin transactions are so cheap because there is so little demand for real value transfers on those blockchains.

I don't see how that strategy would kill off bitcoin, because if the hard fork contained features which the community widely desired but a few core devs opposed, then the hard fork would essentially become the real bitcoin, and the hard fork devs would be the new key devs, and the old core devs who refused to go along with the economic majority would become irrelevant. On the other hand, if the hard fork contained features than were highly controversial (approximately 50/50 support), then this could be an effective attack.

It depends on how Bitcoin dies. If that one particular blockchain dies from self-inflicted wounds, then other cryptocurrencies will capture much of that value. Only if the death of Bitcoin is caused by something that makes the entire concept of blockchain cryptocurrencies obsolete would altcoins also die. The Bitcoin block size debate and mining centralization are threats which fall in the self-inflicted wounds category; they do not have any relevance to other coins.

If/when Core devs (the top Bitcoin experts) come to consensus on how to raise the block size limit, then you're right, there will be no chain split. But BU (non-experts) is trying to raise the block size limit with a plan that has never been tested and that the vast majority of experts (not only Core but also including the top wallet and exchange devs) do not think is safe. They are trying to manipulate miners through coercion and/or deception to execute a hard fork against the consent of most experts and a huge portion of the user base who don't want to trust their money to software created by a small group of folks who apparently lack any notable Bitcoin development experience. That would guarantee a permanent chain split, a disaster for Bitcoin.

Raising the block size limit in principle is not controversial, but when you get down to specifics, we are far from consensus. The questions of how to do it, how big the new block size should be, and how much lead time is required to prepare for a hard fork, have not been answered or agreed upon. That is necessary before any backwards incompatible block size limit increase can take place safely.


Bitcoin Core developers understand that they must ensure Bitcoin will continue working uninterrupted hundreds of years into the future. Moore's law is already slowing down. The laws of physics impose real limitations on what is technically possible. It would be reckless for them to assume that bandwidth and computation power will continue increasing for hundreds of years. Bitcoin's value is predicated on the guarantee that it is immutable and eternal. Without a block size limit, the blockchain will at some point overwhelm bandwidth and/or computation capacity of ordinary individuals to independently verify the blockchain, and Bitcoin will become fatally centralized or maybe even break down and stop functioning altogether. Even if that won't occur in the next 50 years, competent Bitcoin devs must take a long-term view.

Governments and citizens often have divergent interests. Encouraging citizens to invest in bitcoin would give them unprecedented financial prosperity, but at the cost of the government losing power. The question is, which governments will be wise enough to relinquish their power in exchange for financially empowering its citizens. Relinquishing power is not in government's nature, so this is a big challenge. Once the benefits of widespread bitcoin investment begin to appear in one country and become widely appreciated, every other country will enthusiastically follow, herd-like, toward the financial singularity. It will be interesting to see when and where it happens first.

I am definitely not an expert on the technical details, but I do have a general understanding of what would happen to the Bitcoin network if all Bitcoin traffic between China and the rest of the world were blocked. My question though is about what could possibly cause this to occur? It seems very unlikely that the Chinese government will adapt the North Korean policy of blocking all international internet traffic, and even if they did decide they wanted to block Bitcoin specifically, aren't there efforts underway to encrypt Bitcoin P2P traffic so that it won't be possible to identify it as Bitcoin, and thus impossible to block it?

That's right, but only from the perspective of people who already hold ETH. After the hard fork, people who buy either ETH or ETC will own half as much of the total money supply (ETH +ETC) as they would have received pre-fork. 
We can debate whether the new money supply is ETH + ETC or whether they are two separate monies. I don't know if it exists yet, but one could develop a wallet that seamlessly handles both ETH and ETC; if this wallet gained popularity, then in terms of functionality from the user perspective, there would be no difference between the two chains. Currently there is a big difference in the value of the two chains, but there is no guarantee that this will persist. A big bank or government could easily ensure that the two chains reach parity simply by buying ETC until the price is equal. Given the low market cap and liquidity of ETH and ETC, it would require less than 100 million dollars to make it happen, which would be a low price to pay for a bank or government to essentially kill the limited money supply attribute of a cryptocurrency, a major reason why it is a threat to their existence. If Bitcoin has a contentious hard fork with two surviving chains, I am nearly certain that at least one hostile entity in the world will attempt this attack.

I think the majority of the educated bitcoin community have a basic understanding of the concepts of sidechains and lightning network.. However, the majority also understands two other facts: those scalability solutions will not be ready for deployment without years more research and development, and bitcoin network capacity will be exceeded within one year. Therefore the only proposal on the table to avoid a catastrophic capacity crunch is to raise the max block size sooner. To reject a max block size increase in the next six months to one year is to guarantee that bitcoin will suffer a catastrophic capacity crunch, as Hearn has described. The majority is capable of comprehending what disaster that holds for the future of bitcoin.

You never actually hold coins, you hold cryptographic private keys which allow you to spend coins at the corresponding public address on the blockchain. If there is a hard fork, that will only affect the rules for valid new transactions; the fork will not alter any prior blockchain balances or alter the cryptography which allows only your private keys to spend the coins at your public addresses. So if a contentious fork happens, just sit back and wait until it is resolved with a clear winner, then you will be free to transact on the winning chain will complete confidence.

"Soft fork dirty, hard fork clean" was just a propaganda talking point for stupid people.
@_date: 2017-04-02 03:03:08
Well, there probably is something wrong with that logic. It's just a guess as to how he/they might be thinking. I suppose that if the big price rise happened earlier it would attract more competition into mining, so that when their new mining facility comes online their market share would be less than if the price had stayed lower. By keeping the price lower they are sacrificing current revenue in exchange for bigger market share immediately after their new facility comes online. I think this is really stupid, short-term thinking, but the people we are talking about aren't geniuses.

The idea that the government of China is an enemy of Bitcoin is completely rational. Ultimately it doesn't really matter what the Chinese miners' personal opinions about Bitcoin are, the fact that they are within the jurisdiction of China means they must submit to the will of the PRC/PBOC or else they will suffer imprisonment, confiscation of property, and/or death. There is no tradition of rule of law or property rights in China. The PBOC could issue a secret ultimatum to Jihan and other top players in China saying, for example, that if strong anonymity features (enabled by Segwit) come to Bitcoin, the government will seize control of all mining operations in the country. In this situation they would all comply with the Chinese government against the interest of Bitcoin. We already know the PBOC has several times issued ultimatums to exchanges in secret meetings, so why would anyone be surprised if they were interfering in the mining sector too?

If you knew that your mining market share was going to jump from, say, 20 percent now to 40 percent two months from now, you would make more money if you delayed a huge BTC price rise until after you doubled your market share.

I have read the 70% figure many places, but I make no claims as to its accuracy. It could be more, could be less. I would appreciate if someone has more accurate information. But I don't think anyone disputes that Bitmain's market share is well over 50%. I am sure some of it is being used to signal Segwit, but Jihan doesn't need to control 100% of the hardware he manufactures to block Segwit. If Bitmain only manufactures 50% and he controls 50% of that through direct ownership and coercion of his customers (if you signal Segwit I won't sell you more hardware), that's more than enough to block Segwit.

False. Bitcoin has 21 million units. If you make a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, creating 21 million new tokens out of thin air, those new tokens are not bitcoins.
If you want to believe that Bcash is just a "different version" of Bitcoin, then you must also believe that Bitcoin's monetary policy is not immutable, that anyone can increase the money supply beyond 21 million simply by making a new copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. That would be ridiculous, of course, and I'm sure when you think about more you'll realize the truth.

Price inflation/deflation is good/bad depending on circumstances. In a world where governments have massive debts, inflation eases the burden; that is good for governments and anyone with debt, but bad for consumers and savers. Deflation is good for savers and investors, terrible for debtors. Most people from all sides of the economic argument think that price stability is a good thing. The fiat monetary system is horribly flawed, but not every government action is necessarily bad. Most of them are, but a few of Bernie's positions, such as defeating parasitic oligopolies like Wall Street and the health insurance industry, are rational and would benefit the economy. At the same time, I support bitcoin because it will compete with the fiat system and bring balance and diversity to the world economy, and huge profits to anyone with the insight to understand this phenomenon.

The opposite. In theory, no one should have the private key to that address. The string of characters "BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend" is extremely non-random, so the probability of finding a private key that generates that that non-random string is extremely low.

Look what happened with Litecoin Segwit activation. Team Jihan thugs wanted desperately to block Segwit on Litecoin, but the Litecoin community was unanimously in favor it. Since there was overwhelming support for it among users, they started preparing for UASF activation. Team Jihan realized that they did not have the power to stop a UASF, so in order to avoid being exposed as powerless and to save face, they capitulated to the users and activated Segwit as MASF. It's an example of successful negotiation. The same would happen in Bitcoin if the users rally together behind UASF like Litecoin did. The time for fear is over. The time to act is now.

BU will cause permanent chain splits; non-BU full nodes will never accept the BU chain, no matter how much hashrate it has. UASF Segwit, on the other hand, is compatible with non-Segwit nodes; if the Segwit chain gets at least 51% of hashrate, non-Segwit nodes will abandon the non-Segwit chain and accept the Segwit chain as valid.
Summary: BU will definitely cause a permanent chain split, while UASF Segwit will only cause a temporary split, which will be resolved after Segwit activates (if the Bitcoin economy actually wants Segwit).

I said "hostile miners" specifically; of course most miners are not hostile, but certain influential entities in the mining space are currently acting in a way that is hostile to Bitcoin, and it's having a terrible effect.


I agree. But if we don't find that solution, there needs to be a backup plan. We can't sacrifice Bitcoin's future because we are afraid of a fight.

That psychological effect may be real, but I have not seen evidence that it has had a measurable effect on the price of bitcoin. Financially unsophisticated people who would be dissuaded from buying bitcoin because of the price per coin are probably incapable of understanding the fundamental reasons why bitcoin is valuable in the first place, so they are not in the pool of potential bitcoin investors.

It is possible for two seemingly contradictory things to be true, and there are countless examples. The free market is indeed the primary driver of economic progress, but government intervention can also be beneficial. Think of all that we have gained from NASA and DoD research. In terms of what Bernie Sanders is advocating, providing a public health insurance system would save hundreds of billions of dollars, providing a massive boost to the free market economy because people will have more money to spend or invest, even though that seems like an anti-free market policy. Ideological purity is the logical fallacy.

Holding Segwit hostage in order to ram through a contentious hard fork that is all but guaranteed to split Bitcoin, which is what Segwit2x is trying to accomplish, is not healing the community. I'm sure some of the folks supporting Segwit2x have good intentions, but that's not enough.

Bitmain is a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic of China. The regime has a bigger incentive in maintaining the dominance of its own fiat banking system and not giving its 1.4 billion subjects financial sovereignty. Its incentive is to cripple Bitcoin, not to help it reach its full potential. That's why Bitmain and centralization of Bitcoin mining in China is so dangerous.

If Segwit activates through Segwit2x, that means BIP148 has succeeded. The goal of BIP148 was always to activate Segwit. Failure would be if certain miners break their promise and back out of Segwit2x, and most Bitcoiners turn out to be cucks and capitulate to the hostile miners, accepting the miners' veto power over Bitcoin development as a permanent attribute of Bitcoin.

Theoretically true. But in reality, the notion that there is an 80-20 split in favor a 2x hard fork is obviously absurd to anyone who spends 15 minutes looking at Bitcoin social media and where the top companies in the industry stand. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Btc-e, Huobi, OKCoin, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Poloniex, and BitMex are not supporting the New York Agreement. That's more than half of the global Bitcoin exchange market, probably more than 80% of real trading volume, that will not go along with the hard fork. Also, the top PC wallet in the industry, Electrum, is supporting BIP148.
I don't have enough influence to be the leader of the healing process, and probably not smart enough either, but what I think should happen is that the people who have been blocking Segwit (Jihan, Roger Ver, etc.) repent and ask for the community's forgiveness (very unlikely); those who have tried to work with the obstructionists in good faith (the Segwit2x participants) should admit that they made a mistake trying to work with bad actors rather than call them out and re-embrace the open source software development process that has gotten Bitcoin to where it is; and those of us who were on the right side in this dispute (Segwit, UASF supporters) should forgive and welcome back into the fold those who have legitimately learned from their error in judgment. Then we should all focus on developing science-based solutions to improve Bitcoin transaction throughput, privacy, and security that emerge from the open source software development process and pass extremely thorough peer review and testing. That's how we MAKE BITCOIN GREAT AGAIN.

It's a good thing Bitcoin mining isn't centralized in Russia, so they can only regulate their own citizens, not the network.

Jihan/Bitmain only operates because the government allows it. They could take away that privilege at a whim. No due process in China. It is a highly sophisticated, intrusive, authoritarian regime. If the government tells Jihan/Bitmain they must censor all transactions that are not sent to whitelisted addresses, he would have to comply or face prison and confiscation of all property. We don't know what restrictions/directives they have already imposed on him, but it would be incredibly naive to believe that he is operating freely and motivated only by profit.
