I guess simply buying Bitcoin is the best option at this stage then?

I'd like to see them try - we don't have the patriot act in Ireland.

I plan on meeting him for lunch and I want to have an agenda for the meeting based on bitcoin proliferation. You are saying I should lay in wait in the corner of the restaurant, jump out at him and, sort-of, freestyle my questions..? This is how you do business..?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:54
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:29:06
Yeah.. figured as much. (the fact I worked for one of the largest hardware manufacturers on the planet for three years and could have got major discounts has me kicking myself but so it goes...)
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:00:21
Thanks..

No - the Luddites were 19th-century English textile artisans who violently protested against the machinery introduced during the Industrial Revolution.. however, in common usage it refers to someone who simply doesn't really understand new technology. In English, if you understand what a word means in context, it suddenly becomes correct.. who'd have thunk [sic] it..?
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:58:49
yes, thanks. 
Seems to me that there is huge potential right now acting as service provider to companies that want to convert - surprising to me that no-one is doing it commercially yet.

These are the guys behind the 80's/90's UK pop sensation, [KLF]( and acts like [The Timelords]( - they wrote a book on how to [make a number one hit]( - They play with money, use it like tokens in an arcade.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:48:25
I would hire him.
@_date: 2013-03-21 21:07:04
I can't see that it would be unsafe, really. Can't imagine anyone in power taking their heads out their arses long enough to have even heard of Bitcoin, let alone legislate against it's use. We'll see I guess. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:20:37
Oh, that's really sweet. And to think I got all *praying mantis*..  
(Astrolabe..? After the wine or the astronomical thing.?)

til - people *actually* pay for porn...
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:36:46
Thanks but, again.. I have been following Bitcoin since 2010 - I know all this information.. I am having difficulty meshing it with my business.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:22:20
Hmm... that I would have any insight seems unlikely. No.3 seems a good plan. Thanks for your advice..!!
@_date: 2013-09-18 10:02:59
Did you read the article?
@_date: 2013-09-18 11:34:35
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:09:08
Well.. depends on how valuable your involvement in the project could be. This would be a commercial venture - there will be funding for travel expenses etc. The nature of the topic will have no problem attracting paying delegates.. btc accepted, of course.
*edit - I'm based in Ireland but we can arrange it easily in any major city - I organised conferences professionally for years.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:30:13
I reckon we should get some bitcoin investors together and buy the Hungarian porn industry.. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:07:23
Not recommending but asking about the viability of such a move.. seems to me that group-investing in shares of, say, a hardware manufacturer would allow cheap access to mining equipment and give bitcoin a larger platform. I don't see that investing in companies that would aid the growth of bitcoin as being necessarily hostile. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:36:24
You live in Europe..?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:03:24
Right.. what is to say that he wouldn't see it as an opportunity rather than a threat..? 
Converse to your point, I would say that people and organisations also *like to gain* power.. given the state of my country's economy, bitcoin could be extremely empowering if adopted here at a national level.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:17:28
Well, that's the beauty of it, right..? No government can really stop it. (Kind-of related - I think what's happening regarding gun-control in the U.S has parallels in the Gold Confiscation act. - removal of people-power.. scary)

Business opportunity for development of a 'point-of'sale' device..
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:06:59
We could club-together and buy/pay the Hungarian porn industry with bitcoin - it's a good product.
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:00:09


His liking it or not is moot.. valid but irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:21:51
(I just suggested it)
@_date: 2013-04-20 21:31:11
Yes, this is all true, however, location is not the most important element right now. My key focus is on ensuring there is a solid agenda with credible speakers discussing relevant topics.
If you believe you can add benefit to the organisation or execution of this event do you have an interest in taking a role in the project..? What would that role be..? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:48:58
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:12:37
Takeovers need not be hostile - you do not need every user involved - complicated legal work..? I predict a lot of that anyway.


yes.. yes it would. This is the opportunity I am talking about.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:29:57
So.. you are a 'pornographer' too?
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:05:27
Will check it out.. thanks
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:25:26
Again.. I try to approach any and all meetings with an open mind. Deciding his, and the govenrment's, mind before having spoken defeats the purpose of the meeting. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:19:40
The author left out any mention of the Gold Confiscation (April 5, 1933) - that was a pretty big little event.
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:14:36
Why did you weigh-in - to defend the honour of a *random guy*..? Who says chivalry is dead, eh..? You're job here is done, White Knight..
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:30:00
Expand please.. how is this 'a miss'?
