I'm a huge fan of Elon Musk, and I really want him to be successful, but sometimes I feel that the overzealous tendency of his fans (and likely PR people) to automatically give praise for anything he does or says (here on HN or on reddit) is actually counter-productive.
What if Elon starts doing something dumb some day and then when well-informed people try to provide meaningful criticism, they just get criticised and downvoted? I think that could actually undermine support from some of the people that Elon wants it from the most.

You don't actually debate any of his arguments if you do an ad hominem. I'll have my downvotes now.

Why did you have to ruin the open letter with the last childish phrase?

Yep, him asking people to PM or Skype was definitely odd. And then it was confirmed that he was asking them for money to share tips... He's probably five, I retract my advice.

Guys, please don't sell until $1000 because I want to sell at $960.

The sky didn't fall but a lot of people had unsuccessful transactions, were unsatisfied and because of this the network lost some of that userbase expansion.
