Why would they use the stock market to hide wealth and why would they sell for no explicable reason in a bull market? That's complete nonsense. 
The reason stock markets ar scaling has everything to do with interest rates.

Nobody in their right mind would look at a bear stock market and put that money into an even more volatile crypto instead. That's ridiculous and will not happen. 
Furthermore, crypto has no underlying productivity. It doesn't create consumer products, drill oil, build cars or computer chips, nothing. It has completely arbitrary value. Because of that, stocks will always be more reliable. Even if AAPL crashes, that doesn't change the fact that Apple sells hundreds of billions of dollars of electronics.

Are you saying that because you're doing it or because you want to sell if/when the price goes up?

Chargebacks, stolen cards (with canceled transactions), etc. 
They will lose a lot of money and it'll come to bite them. They have no real way to verify the purchaser's identity and they don't have the scale to eat losses.
