We just had another orphaned block too.  Maybe transaction omission is a strategy deployed immediately afterwards?

Thanks!! Now I need to find out how to download the testnet blockchain.
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:59:54
I didn't know Mycelium has a testnet app.  That is awesome of them.  Is there a testnet blockchain explorer you use?

Use these two - It is real simple.

It's the number of transactions in the entire block.  The block reward was the only one.  The same thing just happened for block 336372 and 336373.  I just don't understand why a miner would not want to collect the transaction fees along with the block reward.

Thanks! Without Andreas' book on github I'd have been lost but he explains everything so clearly.

Do you think it belongs to Eligius?

I don't have access to my node right now.  I'll find the bitcoin forum that corroborated it later.  I believe they are linked to Josh Zerlan and Nasser Ghoseiri.  Who do you think owns them?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:46:51
Sorry Bud.  I maintain that you are wrong.  Take a look at the level II order book here.  The total amount column is cumulative and would clear us through $182.50.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:40:29
You're right.  The tx is written with an incremental amount being pulled from a larger of two balances.  You'll see by following them through that the larger of the two VOUTs in each tx are being pushed forward.

It is the timeline and activity within that address that lends me to believe it is still BFL's.  The FTC request and subsequent injunction was on 9/18/14 and the court ruling to wind down operations was 12/23/14.  The address was active frequently through to 9/12/14 and then activity suspended with the freeze.  Then it reactivated again on 1/3/15 after it was lifted.

Couple the known such as the daily block reward with the unknowns like this.  What you have is pressure in a thin market.  In a series of events, mining coinbase offloads with instances like this then trigger the chartists and speculators trading technicals which takes you next into margin calls.  This is still a fragile market and chain reactions like that occur.

Sure...look at this unconfirmed transaction from a few minutes ago.  Work the inputs backwards and you'll tie into the origin input above.

There is this as well.  Butterfly Labs status of current operations from last night.  It was an acknowledgement that refunds are issued currently in bitcoin due to a lack of cash reserves.
Refunds are currently being paid in bitcoin. The last refund request date that was paid for USD refunds is approximately August 6, 2014. Because the cost of the Temporary Receivership and our legal defense against the FTC have consumed a substantial portion of our cash reserves, we anticipate being able to resume cash refund and rebate payments in February when we are operationally ready.

They have to try to make customers whole.  Previous class action lawsuits estimated over 25 million in prepayments potentially eligible for refunds.  With 94000 coins remaining at current price, they'll need to sell nearly every one of them.  I expect continuous activity against the address soon.

Butterfly Labs vice president Jeff Ownby explained his company’s view on the developing situation and said that on 23rd December, the Court handed control of the company and assets back to Butterfly Labs.  That concurs with the reactivation of bitcoin address 12WRnQR85ZUT7dhmaHBNL5dde2QLYieW6v.  Fast forward and you'll see 18,000 coins dumped by Butterfly Labs since the court return of these assets.  What is scary is that 40,000 coins are still sitting unspent.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:32:53
You are incorrect.  A market order sell of 5,000 btc on bitfinex right now would clear the book from $198 to $185.  These volumes are significant.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:45:01
We'll see whether I'm wrong.  Watch BFL sell out the balance like they've been doing since 12/23.  This is the refund money.

Thanks.  I wrote that in error.  I meant peerluck.com.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:14:24
It appears this has been a continuous (every 2 or 3 minutes) dump of all 127k coins in the last couple days.  UTXOs are still being pushed out of it on a continuous basis.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:27:23
These are Butterfly Labs coins on the move.  They are controlled by Josh Zerlan w/ a public note to peerluck.com.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:11:53
Want more PROOF?  Here is an unconfirmed transaction originating from the address above.  It is a continuous BFL DUMP.  I'll revisit when activity starts in on the 90000 coins remaining.  It'll be a big validation.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:04:32
On December 23 a Missouri court ordered a winddown of Butterfly Labs and they began a refund plan.....now here is my theory...I was looking at the blockchain and came across a 5000 btc utxo taken incrementally down to 0....it was sold off continuously.  It took me to here. 
Activity on that address started back up on 12/23 the day the courts provided control again.  Ive tied it to butterfly labs because a OP_RETURN said paycoin.com linked to Josh Zerlan an employee of butterflylabs.
What is scary is another 90000 unspent coins reside here also controlled by butterfly labs.
I think youll have butterfly labs forced to continue to sell the remaining 94000 coins in this court mandated wind down in order to provide refunds to those customers....That is a ton of coins to continuously dump...it exceeds 24 hour volume on the largest exchange.
