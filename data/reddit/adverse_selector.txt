I think size/liquidity is still an issue. The typical lot size for an interbank FX trade is ~$1mm; on major pairs like EUR/USD you can trade this size (or much more) all day long with a spread under 1bps (0.01%) and very low fees. A round-trip trade on most BTC exchanges costs 40-60bps in fees and to do just $1mm USD worth you will impact the market significantly.
Most hedge funds have billions of dollars in capital to deploy. Even if BTC is a great opportunity, these funds can't invest enough in today's markets to make it attractive.

Yes many trading desks have screens with CNBC or Bloomberg News running, but it's mostly just for background noise and to get a feel for market color. Nobody is making decisions based on the talking heads there. They literally have segments where people just shout at one another or fools like Kramer trying to drive retail investors into random stocks.
I'd say the demographic that actually *watches* CNBC is more akin to retirees who like to watch their stocks. The ads bear this out as well. Lots of shills for rip-off gold merchants, insurance plans, reverse mortgages, etc. They might invest as well, but if they're watching their portfolio on CNBC they probably can't figure out Google Finance, let alone Bitcoin.

Can the matching engine print trades at the aggressive incoming order's price?
For example:
-Bid 200
-Ask 205
-Someone enters a Bid limit for 100 BTC @ 210
Can I enter a Ask limit 100 @ 209.99 and match this order since it's the best bid, even though other better offers are still resting on the book?
If you can do that seems like you could get filled outside the best bid/offer and then sweep the offers below the price where you traded for a guaranteed arb.
