They've said that for 6+ months. Segwit isn't even adopted yet and look how long that's been done. Ln won't be out until late 2018 earliest

No it's definitely much more advanced than segwit in terms of ease of adoption. And even than...segwit is something around 10% adopted.
HOWEVER...with all that said...Lightning COULD see a much quicker adoption rate simply because it's not just a "bitcoin" only thing. That and...someone more well versed in law than me would have to verify how the new tax reform will affect the US (even though the US doesn't do most of the trading anyway, it's still a decent part). If LN swaps would not be taxxed, you'll see LN much faster, where as if LN swaps are taxxed...well...personally... I'm in fear of crypto at this current time simply because I live in the US and the new tax reform could kill it for a lot of the US participants.

The problem is... we are currently at our "max". We all understand that just increasing blocksize isn't a fix to scaling. But we won't be able to sustain another 6 - 12 months of fee's like this. 
Segwit will take roughly 6 months to become fully adopted (time from implementation), LN even longer (and it's not even finalized yet). 
We arn't shooting for paypal/visa tx's per second right now. We should be trying to keep the fee's REASONABLE ($5) for our current usage, while we implement the long term scaling solutions by end of 2018.
I feel that if we don't have room for the "heard" (which we dont right now), we will lose a lot of interest that is really needed for such an early adoption period.

20% and growing

Available to the public and adopted are 2 different things sadly. Segwit has been available for a while now and is no where near adopted. LN will take another 6 months to be "complete" and atleast another 6 months to be adopted.

That's true to an extent, however... lots of industries are now learning from the very mistakes that caused a lot of those "replacements" to happen. Evolution is needed, and you need to evolve as quick or quicker than your competitors. The only businesses that die are ones that don't evolve. 
This is my biggest problem with bitcoin atm...there is a huge consensus that even with segwit/LN fully adopted that 1MB blocks was not enough for long-term. So why havn't they evolved to realize that and increased even slightly to say 2MB-4MB (to ease short term and prepare long term).
I'm a huge bitcoin advocate simply because I know that quick evolution CAN keep them at the top of the pyramid forever, but...they need to happen...stagnation is the death for bitcoin.
TLDR - Life/Business/Cryptos/Everything you can possibly imagine is driven by evolution. If you don't evolve, you don't survive.

Gold will lose its value much quicker than a 100 years friend.

Problem is.... LN will take 6 months to a year to become adopted. I'm personally all for Segwit (which isn't even adopted yet) which will definitely help lower transaction fee's and get rid of a lot of tx's on the mempool). And I'm 100% for lightning (which will do the same as segwit except much better).
These solutions will take too long to get going...If we want to give ourself the time to adopt our new great tech, we are going to need to increase the blocksize in the short-term. Even if we just went with a 4MB-8MB block size, that would give us the time we need to get everything in order. And even if we went with 8MB to REALLY make sure we were ok, we could always revert back to 4 or 2 once everything is in place.

The fact that the global economy is already no longer backed in gold 100% and within 100 years time technology and the worlds economy that such a thing a backed currency will just no longer be a thought.

The 30k wall will be the hardest to break, once we are at 30k bitcoin will achieve 500 billion market cap which puts it near some of the biggest companys in the world. At that market cap, governments will have to force some sort of regulations very quickly, so I hope we are ready for them.

Openoffice is far from crappy and has plenty more options than 365.

I'm thinking the general populous will definitely be selling a lot between the 20-30k market for that exact reason. The "widespread" boom that has happened recently put most people buying between 12-16k, and they will be plenty glad to double their money in such a short time. (my mom is one of them, though she will only be taking back her original investment than letting the rest hodl)

My take is BTC will continue to grow 2-3k a day until reaching 50k, at which point it will grow 10k a day. I am not going to buy BTC as it won't dip lower than it is right this second. Hope, secnario will work.

You'll only close the channel when you want to "withdraw" coins back to the main chain.
