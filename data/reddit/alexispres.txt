I don't see you decentralizing this knowledge to educate others 
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:35:23
What? This post isn't consistent with the title whatsoever. Are these books available online for free? In what way are you decentralizing education and distributing it by posting a picture of your books?

Those are arbitrarily placed lines

Same thing as holding, but a meme. HODL is HOLD typed too fast to worry about typos.

What is ripple?

I would imagine because at a certain point it would be clear that the amount of debt existent exceeds the amount of Bitcoin possible to be produced, and the debts would be uncollectable, making it impossible for state actors to hold ridiculously high debts in the hope of creating that much currency one day.

A bunch of people in this thread have asked this question, and nobody has tried to answer it lol

In short, no. I don't think so.

There's a lot more technical considerations if we're going to get real technical

What does HODL stand for?

Thinking the main stream media is full of shit is not an alt-right only viewpoint. It is a simplistic way to think that ideas do not cross boundaries of "groupings". If only the world really worked that way, it would be a lot easier. Somehow people are actually complex individuals with a lot of cross cutting ideologies swimming around inside their heads.

What would one of you fine Bitcoin advocates say to claims that Bitcoin itself is heavily influenced by a small number of parties?

Gold created in a lab would cost millions if not billions of dollars to create and might then be radioactive for a long time. Pretty much the same scenario for gold off of asteroids.

Life support, radiation shielding, escaping earth's gravity, all of the considerations going into rocket travel in general. That's why it's an abstract "going z fast you'd travel the distance to the moon in y time", the moment you add any more technical considerations it begs the question "why didn't you consider x technical consideration?" and becomes a needlessly pedantic discussion, which was my point.

Is a scripting language really a perfect comparison here? HTML has been updated continuously and has a function that isn't simply "people value it"
