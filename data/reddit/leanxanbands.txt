Keep dreaming there is huge excess of bitcoin because everyone is just hoarding it not using for transactions like they should be..

One fact you leave out is that no one uses bitcoin... the price jumped so high is because a bunch of rich people got together and bought up all the bitcoin to jack up the price on purpose classic pump n dump... bitcoin was basically started so people could sell drugs on the internet without being tracked everyone seems to forget that....

People need to realise bitcoin is ment to be a tradable currency not a business investment... it should go down to $1 and stay that way in till a true bitcoin economy starts moving
