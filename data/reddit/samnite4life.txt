I feel like I'm going to read an exclusive report in Wired in a few years about how the Secret Service set up a front re-shipping company and got the home address of every major hacker in Latvia.

That's probably why he got 2x 2FA codes sent to his phone- one for the hacker to login, then another one for the hacker to turn off the 2FA for withdrawals.

I spot checked the list- looks like there are duplicates of a lot of, if not all the names (eg Lindsay Ford and Steve zmuda appears twice), so the actual posted leak, without duplicates, is about half as long. 
EDIT: I checked it with a duplicate culler, and result is 889 duplicates. Link to tool used: 
It looks like this list was generated by scraping bitcoin forums and other related sites, then cross-checked with coinbase to reveal the name attached, as described here:
So not really a leak (as in inside-only info was released from inside coinbase), more of an abuse of coinbase's 'request money' feature from the outside.

He input the codes to a fake coinbase site controlled by the hacker.

I think the standard way the scam works is to get a hacked paypal account (or use a relative's credit card to register a paypal account), then once the bitcoins have been delivered, they call the credit card company and say that the card was stolen. 
This is turn forces paypal's hands, since the credit card company charges back against paypal, who is in turn forced to recoup the money from the seller. 
It happens frequently in digital goods transactions besides currencies, such as TF2 and DOTA 2 game items, and the seller gets screwed in nearly all cases.

Unlike other investments, you can fap inside it.
