Hi there, I just wanted to let you know that I marked the offer as over in the thread, but that is including your potential submission. Please feel free to shoot and upload, the offer is still available to you.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:09:50
This is AWESOME.  Can you PM me and we'll take it from there?
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:11:03
No, I'm sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:29:30
Item purchased and awaiting shipment.
Edit, since it might be more visible here: I have decided to also buy and donate a [Moto G]( for each smashed iPhone.  Please see Edit 4 of main post.

Why would I want to promote the donation of phones on which the recipient cannot choose their own software?
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:23:20
Video currently being processed, will reply further as soon as it's done!
Edit: Nice work.  The order has been placed.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:06:44
This sounds like a decent idea.  Please recommend someone reputable and an escrow service.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:38:23
If it's your device, I think anything you choose to do with it is okay, so long as it doesn't harm someone else.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:44:42
Please let me take a moment to review your account history because I don't know who you are, but apparently you are reputable.
Edit: Alright, I sent the BTC.  Thanks for doing this.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:31:58
I'm sorry, this is only for 5 and 5S.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:38:37
I think the very fact that the scumbag steve meme is being upvoted and you are downvoted, even though it is factually incorrect and you are right (and not even angry about it), is evidence that dogecoiners are swamping this forum and downvoting anything that portrays them in a bad light.  Which only further proves your point.  A lot of people pretend it's a joke, and to some it really is, but the majority is a group of nervous nellies, anxiously biting their fingers in anticipation, praying that this "joke" can be their 3rd shot at a crypto bubble they missed with with other altcoins.
The dogecoin community sentiment is fake, because it only exists within the community itself.  When you take dogecoiners and put them anonymously in other places, where actual criticism of dogecoin exists, they will attack you with downvotes.  Very few of them are actually genuine.
If you happen to catch them being negative and call them out, they'll sometimes flood you with much doge love so you forget it happened, but the original comments you found were the real indicators of their true underlying sentiment.

I've been part of the bitcoin community for a lot longer than that, but I'd rather this promotion be separate from my other history.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:39:05
For every iphone smashed I am also buying and donating a Moto G.  Please read the post.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:05:13
Well, crap.  What do I do?
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:49:51
NICE. Part of the requirements were to include your face and also say why you're destroying your phone.  Can you post that as a short followup to your account to meet the requirements?
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:56:59
Yeah, I definitely suspect a lot of people will believe that.  I don't blame them.
I've been part of the bitcoin community for a while now.  The banning of Blockchain, the last bitcoin app in the app store, I think should be the last straw for anyone interested in bitcoin who thinks ownership of your own device is important.
So I guess all I can provide right now is my word.  But like I said, I'm open to suggestions.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:21:21
Please don't, that won't count.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:09:40
Someone else recommended bitcoin escrow as a hedge, so I'd rather do that.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:22:27
Just a link to the model you want and a shipping address (via email).
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:31:47
I guess you could, but then you'd be an ass.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:44:03
If we downvote the doge posts, then they claim we hate dogecoin and their community and we're a bunch of selfish jerks.  If we don't, then the bitcoin subreddit gets clouded with doge posts.
So you can't win either way.  It's the sneakiest, most dishonest way of redirecting people from bitcoin to dogecoin.  And it's promoted by the doge community.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:54:30
The instructions state that they must upvote this thread from the device.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:02:25
Yes, we know that.  My personal opinion is that Apple *owes* us nothing.  However, as consumers, that doesn't mean we should *want* or *expect* nothing but what they are willing to provide us.  We vote with our dollars, and with our bitcoin.  And our bitcoin is only available on Android, so Apple made this choice for us.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:01:23
Saturday night?  I can't see this going past then.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:40:51
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:56:15
It's just fun and spur of the moment, it's not exactly driven by acidic hatred.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:20:48
This all sounds good.  Get antonopolous on the line, and we'll set that up.
The btc equivalent is also a good idea.  I will make that an option to anyone.  I don't care so much that the Nexus is bought as the iPhone is smashed, so in that case I'd just send it 100% without questions or requiring proof of purchase of a Nexus.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:07:14
The statement being made is worth the difference.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:56:53
Would be cool, but much more difficult to verify.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:34:37
Some are reserved spots for videos that I know are going to happen or which are being uploaded now.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:15:46
When some of these people bought the iPhone, it had bitcoin apps on it.  Apple-approved bitcoin apps.  Then they changed their mind.
By this logic, since Apple's terms probably say they can remove any app arbitrarily for any reason, that would mean that we should expect them to remove all apps for no reason, and that all iPhones are bricks that should be purchased by no one.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:31:19
No, I'm sorry :(
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:32:30
They have to visit this thread and upload it from the phone, it's in there.
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:54:31
I am willing to buy the US phone or send the dollar equivalent for a US phone.  If the money can't buy the phone where you are, you'll have to be content with just having money.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:33:41
You realize that when a product is made, the matter does not disappear from the universe.  It goes back into the planet, in the long run.  In the long run, everything does...
I have conviction that by the time it actually matters, humanity will be running a net zero carbon footprint.  Human ingenuity trumps everything.
In the long run, these 5, 10, 15 phones, whatever, make absolutely no difference to anything.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:10:25
You are still applicable if you are one of the first 5 in the thread.  As of this comment, there is only 1.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:37:15
Just have 'em post or PM me.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:08:27
The machete was awesome.  We have PM'd and are setting up the order!
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:21:40
Perfect.  Can you PM me and we can take it from there?
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:42:17
I love it.  Please PM me if you haven't already and we'll get this Nexus 5 rolling. :)
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:40:54
Yes, this is absolutely reserved as  if you do this within the next 24 hours.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:41:44
I will collect them when I get a chance later today.
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:04:10
Hm, is there something else I can provide?  Anything I PM you is liable to be shared.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:32:13
This is solely to prevent things like:
1) Uploading other old videos of people smashing iphones
2) Stealing one and doing it, and remaining anonymous
@_date: 2014-02-06 10:27:58
If you are outside the US I will send $350 worth of bitcoin instead.
