Oh great, now a boss needs to first contact you to make you turn on your node before he can pay you. Oh but he wants to pay all his employees. Oh no, one is not available. Well I guess that guy is not going to get paid.
 Being online to receive a payment is the most un user friendly idea I have ever heard in my life.

No,that's not how LN currently works. The tx just fails.

It still kind of sucks that you have to be online 24/24 to receive payments. I hope they will fix that in the future. I missed a payment yesterday because my internet went down for 2 hours.

Cause it was forced down the troaths of everybody that really just wanted the block size to be a little bit higher?  Now you can see how much consensus there really was for segwit. The consensus was for segwit + a higher blocksize.
Segwit is over-complex and is not a scaling solution. It just fixes tx malleability that is needed for the LN. And LN is still a clusterfuck of epic proportions. But who gives a shit. Nobody uses bitcoin as money. Bitcoin is digital gold now. But the value is going down so it's a shitty store of value if you started storing your value since dec 2017. (more then half the people in crypto right now are new since the last 6 months) 
Good luck to any dev stuck with having to support segwit and asking himself: why the fuck do I have to write code for this?

Why do we listen to these guys? Maxwell have given up on Bitcoin, he is now developing for Monero. And he is known for mining alt coins.
And Adam Back is failing to deliver a smooth transition from the first to the second layer.
Price is going down and more and more people are leaving Bitcoin for other coins. 
So I don't understand why this sub values these peoples opinions so much?

How do we know what you are saying it true?
