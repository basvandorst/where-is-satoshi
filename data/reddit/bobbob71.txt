I just lurk then. However, a Tb hard drive is peanuts so I doubt it has anything to do with block size. Ppl either don’t care, or are like me and just a IT noob.

I have my copay multisig set up. If I delete the apps. 
Can I use a different wallet using my seed words to recreate my multisig transactions? 
Or am I stuck with copay?

Do all wallets do this? I mean... only connect to certain full nodes? 
I’m trying to set up a multisig wallet. One on my phone and one on my laptop. I use an iPhone tho so electrum won’t work. Any better suggestions than copay?

I think you are confusing mnemonic code words with a 512-bit seed. 
I believe I can combine the code words with a password (salt) before the key stretching function that makes my 512-bit seed. 
Idea being that even if my words are found they cannot generate my seed as they won’t know my Salt.

Funny you say that. It was trying to charge me over $3 to send my first test transaction. (I played with the few settings to change it to the lowest possible)

I want too. Bought a raspberry pi but all the guides you have to use a command line. 
Someone needs to develop a easy installer! As 99% of ppl have never used the command line. I had to YouTube what it was ffs.

Couldn’t figure out how to get an OS image that worked with etcher so went with ubuntu. 
Question- why do you use the SSH? Can’t I just do it all from my pi?

It’s not what I’m looking for .... I’m looking for a nice windows 10 display. That has a bit B on my desktop that I click and it launches Bitcoin core. Is a pi powerful enough to run windows?

He also said 20k by end of 2018. So.....

So to confirm.... 
My plan is to download the blockchain on my windows laptop. Then copy just the blockchain folders over to my Linux version on my raspberry pi?

Thanks. Final question. What OS should I put in my Pi? 
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:19:04
What version of the bitcoin core do you down load for that OS tho? Linux (tgz), ARM Linux? Or Ubuntu (Ppa)?
