I can't but help notice a concerted effort by the financial institutions and media to trash bitcoin, making a big deal out of the credit card ban is a perfect example of them working hand-in-hand.  I'm not generally a paranoid conspiracy theory type person, but am beginning to wonder how low those in the financial industry wants it to go before they jump in and buy big-time.  I heard one broker claim $6K, so it might be soon.
