This is incredibly sad, I hope OP sees this post! Paging @_date: 2017-12-27 13:43:11
Sounds like another layer of fee driven complexity on top of an already complex network. Not really sure if thats the direction btc should be heading

Some of this was very eye opening. Thanks

It's certainly interesting, but have the complications of a "segmented" blockchain been fully considered? These lightning transactions have to sync back with the normal chain at some point correct?

Read this really quickly as SNES. Was confused as to why a dead console had a charity

Considering switching too. Next iPhone better be bomb or else. The shortcomings of this device are starting to make me grow weary of it

Same setup here. iPhone 5. Love the thing don't get me wrong. And I know its a new OS with some kinks to work out. But the grip that apple puts on their mobile platform is kinda its biggest weakness and strength imo. The average user fits so well in the balance and I think that's why they do so well. 
John across the street doesn't need a functional in-app bitcoin wallet that can make payments, home screen widgets, AND A SIMPLE SETTING THAT LETS ME CHANGE MY DEFAULT BROWSER...but a more tech savvy individual might.

Any mobile wallets that support auto purchasing at set intervals? Even purchasing at all? Credit Card or ACH is fine, I'm on Android. 
I was a pretty big user like a year or so ago and loved Circle cause I could buy really easy. But they have since switched how it works and stopped selling, you can only hold/trade BTC. I need a new one now.
