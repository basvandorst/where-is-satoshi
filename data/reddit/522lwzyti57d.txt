They haven't broken any laws to date about wire transfers or others. The CFPB doesn't give a shit about consumers anymore, honestly, but having your money tied up behind a million other transactions isn't illegal, dishonest, or even disreputable imo. The feds get involved in any transaction over $10k and 99% of these posts complaining fall into that realm.

Or read any of their own status and support messages. They've been saying since mid December they were having delays with wire transfers.

Because the people complaining about transfers missing are all falling under the federal watchlist guidelines for financial fraud and that has NOTHING to do with the exchange?

Just understand that you're  in line to make support tickets if you fuck something up. Stick to the daily limits, don't do transfers that put you on the federal money laundering watchlists, and you'll be totally fine.

It's also entirely possible that the feds are stepping in on more and more of these transactions. Maybe because they're investigating for fraud, or just because Uncle Sam wants his cut.
They're not stealing anybody's money (USD in Coinbase accounts is FDIC insured), and their wire transfers are clearing eventually. This post is literally a complaint about a transfer he initiated *while Coinbase was actively warning of delays*, and he's mad it was delayed.
