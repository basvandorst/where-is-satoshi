Consensus says move off the exchange! Find a wallet for your phone or a hardware wallet. Good luck, you're sitting on millions after all!

It's an exchange, similar to coinbase. They provide good service afaik.

Then hardware or paper wallet seems like the best option imho. I believe most exchanges don't charge to move off but there will be a fee to move it back onto the exchange.

Someone correct this if wrong but coinsquare has higher etransfer fees. So depending on how you want to fund your account quadriga might be a better option.

This is something I've wondered myself. I personally would avoid low rated new sellers but others might yet provide an option.

[This one]( seems to be the one I hear about the most. It has some specific instructions for how to safely create your paper wallet. I must also disagree with whomever above here said quadriga and coinsquare are bad. Though I can't attest to coinsquare, quadriga is an exchange, that doesn't make it bad. You're adviced not to leave your bitcoin sitting on the exchange is all. It doesn't make an exchange good or bad.

I am new to bitcoin but have only used them so far. I like their etransfer rates better than coinsquare's. But anyone can feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken there.

I've looked high and low for the bitcoin roller coaster guy tshirt that'll ship worldwide. Amazon.com sells the shirt but doesn't ship worldwide... It would make a nice addition to your collection! [Bitcoin roller coaster shirt](
