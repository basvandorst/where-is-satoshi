Don't underestimate David Marcus, he left his job as President of Paypal to head Facebook's messaging team which is currently how payments are sent via FB.
The top Boss of facebook messenger owns bitcoin, has invested in Xapo and loves bitcoin:

Fair point, was a bit misled when I read their findings. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:30:03
Wouldn't users be better off just selling their bitcoins via coinbase and using a debit card? I don't see all the fuss behind Xapo if they have to tack on fees like this.

If you have coins stored on OKcoin I'd recommend moving them off asap.

Most of this "censoring" is automated spam prevention. 
To solve this:
Select: "I can't tweet a link because Twitter thinks it's spam."
The sensationalism in r/bitcoin really needs to end, nobody is trying to censor you. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:34:25
Just do it through local coins, find someone trustworthy who you can wire to and do it in many many chunks rather than all at once. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:32:40
I'm confident that OKCoin and the lot of chinese 0 fee exchanges are placing fake trades to manipulate the price and profit off futures traders. If they are this shady why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:23:56
I think they still have a somewhat shady history. Also, I suppose my point with regards to zero fees isn't super meaningful. I was more or less trying to point out the fact that any exchange that isn't taking any fees is more likely to participate in this sort of behavior as they aren't being properly compensated for their efforts. Obviously an exchange could both take fees and scam (example: some older bitcoin dice sites earned significant amounts off their house edges but still rigged rolls).

People easily forget all the things Roger Ver has done to help bitcoin. Sure he's much more radical than your average venture capitalist but  I'd argue that he's funded more startups in the bitcoin space than any other individual. 
He's made some mistakes and was already punished &amp; criticized for them in the past but he's still an asset to this community. People like Roger, Peter Todd, luke-Jr etc are absolutely controversial and have had unprofessional moments but they have done more for cryptocurrency than anyone commenting here and deserve some respect rather than unreasonable conspiracy theories. 
Okcoin's report comes off as super unprofessional and unnecessary, airing dirty laundry isn't going to help your business. What I gathered was that Okcoin has created an opportunity to weasel themselves out of an unprofitable contract.

Doesn't bitstamp or some major exchanges accept Brazilian Wire?
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:25:46
I'm confident that using crypto we can actually create tools to do this much like provably fair in bitcoin casinos. Imagine if users can keep the exchanges accountable rather than some useless gov't watchdog. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:36:58
They don't want you to make transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:44:05
Progress above ego.
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:59:56
Both ways. Ultimately they may or may not have a major long-term effect on price but they can continue to scrape money away from unsuspecting traders and increase bitcoin volatility. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:36:26
I think we're all so sick and tired of hearing block size arguments that this is a breath of fresh air. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:34:36
Groups like coinwallet are only gunning for attention. This is clearly not a productive way to go about showing the downsides of 1mb blocks. They will effectively be ddosing all bitcoin businesses and users. 
This doesn't demonstrate proof that the block size needs to be raised, this simply proves that bitcoin needs better spam filtering. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:59:57
Vanity metrics.
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:57:05
I can't believe people even upvote this shit. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:07:53
What I mean is if I was interested in buying something from a more obscure website with bitcoin that doesn't accept bitcoin. I've used gyft but it doesn't supply giftcards for a lot of websites I shop at. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:02:07
Good for them, but it's questionable if they are planning to return stolen funds to effected users or are just pocketing them. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:25:29
So I understand that you are 100% sure they have the wrong opinion and will destroy bitcoin. But since when has a wrong opinion been worth censoring on reddit? Why not let the community decide what the best path forward is?
@_date: 2015-03-17 15:50:17
They rebranded. Still the same trustworthy business. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:23:18
Lol maybe if and andreas hype this up enough, bitcoin will actually get blamed. 
Nobody in the general public nor the government has 'blamed' bitcoin.

You can use Zappos or Gilt to purchase shoes. The Gyft App will allow you to convert your bitcoins for giftcards to those places along with others.

My mistake, thanks for the correction. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:31:41
Honestly, I think Changetip will be a useful tool over the next few years but I don't think they are worth buying out and certainly weren't worth the near $10M in funding they received. If Bitcoin becomes "the currency of the internet" third party services like Changetip won't have to exist. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:54:22
I think it's simply because he is extremely narcissistic and makes garbage posts like this all over reddit/bitcointalk to draw attention towards himself.
I don't care who you are Bruce Fenton or who is using your name for advertising, I come here to discuss Bitcoin not see your frequent attention-grabbing posts on the front page. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 21:26:19
I think it's an interesting idea but why would people use this app over just betting between themselves and using something like venmo. The app charges a 1% fee on each bet, venmo is free and fast. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:57:22
If you want my honest opinion, this is not impressive at all.  came out almost two years ago with more features/off chain gambling. You're going to have to drastically change if you want to compete with PD. 
There have been 100s of Satoshidice clones like this and the code is widely spread throughout the internet. 
Also the name is way too similar to luckyb.it another bitcoin gaming site. 
EDIT: Upon further investigation you clearly just ripped off  which itself is a ripoff of SD. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:11:14
Very true, you should pursue them and get the design changed.

I agree with your point regarding Coinbase being relevant for a long time along with the standard hotwallets such as blockchain.info. What I was trying to say is I believe that all wallets will make micro transactions much more convenient.
An example of this is Hive's wallet using "waggle" technology to find nearby users to send funds to without having to send to an address. 
Changetip is more useful than something like a QR code for tipping right now as it allows you to tip people without bitcoin wallets or those who don't even know what bitcoin is. Eventually I see standard wallets adding features to make tipping more streamlined than changetip, I still feel that changetip is a pretty hacky solution to the issue of microtransactions/tipping.
