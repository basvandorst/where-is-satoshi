Yeah that’s kinda the point when I say stop HODLing, I mean to use it. I don’t mean “when do we cash it into single US dollars and roll around in it”. It’s retarded to assume one would even do that.

Well you sell when you intend to use it for material things. Do you pay for everything in your life with BTC or do you maintain some fiat in case you need gas or maybe, I don't know, food?
Until we have 100% universal adoption, which is potentially decades away, you're going to need to convert to fiat to survive.

Thanks, you sound cool too. I’m an alright guy, I suppose. I think I’d just like my family to be taken care of and happy and I’d like this tech to take off. I don’t hate fiat like a lot of people here (it is convenient), but I do see all of its massive flaws. I believe in the tech itself and what it represents, so I’m going to keep buying into it piece by piece. BUT, if my options were to keep accumulating with no end in sight or cash out and live pretty comfortably with my wife and not have to go to an office every day....... you better believe I’m cashing a nice chunk out.

No, you're a hybrid of your mother and your father. Who we can assume were siblings.

Ok, that makes sense. So it’s an indefinite hold because at some point it just becomes THE world currency? I guess that makes sense. 
I guess I just have a picture in my mind of some of the people on here as old men, watching it cross $10mil/coin, going “Nope, still not gonna sell any. It’ll go higher.” Then clutching their chest, face smashing into their keyboard, dead. All with a fortune they never got to do anything with. But I understand your point now.

I think we’ll keep going to 13k, slow but steady, before a pull back to under 11k. We’ll lull for a bit before a push to 18k, where we’ll stall out again. From there, I don’t know.

OP: "GET THE FUCK OUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN IT."  
*General public surprisingly listens, sells BTC, price hits $0.35, wide acceptance stops, OP buys up all BTC, sits in gutter with a cool flashdrive*
You people need the general public to trust in BTC for it to become viable. Don't believe me? Well here, invest in these pressed bottle caps I made. My friends and I think they're all really worth something, so go on, turn some fiat into BCs and enjoy your worthless investment. 
I get the annoyance with people simply inflating the bubble without the belief behind it. But you need those people, so the wide acceptance happens, so that you're not sitting on a bunch of worthless ones and zeros.

Which day? How long ago?

Here, I’ll give you all the responses you can expect to see from this post:
“Hope so. Gives me another opportunity to buy more.”
“Please see the other 1000000 posts on this sub in the last 20 minutes asking the same thing.”
“No one knows.”
“Who cares. HODL.”
“Rocket moon Lambo.”

Never heard that. Original and intelligent.

How do you pay your rent?
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:28:30
Because if you dump hard at 11.2 you get more coins if you buy in with your profit when it hits 10.7.......
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:46:23
*You* mere mortals.
I’m Monstro status. Sorry for my coin dump earlier, fellas.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:22:21
Much more vague than you original answer, lol
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:42:12
See? That’s a totally fair answer. I’d also want to hit my retirement point and then cash out a portion. I guess that’s what I should have asked, at what point do people say “This is enough for me” in terms of BTC price.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:07:29
By stabilize do you mean when it's accepted as a currency by everyone? Because you'd still have to pay the taxes if you're pulling to spend on day to day expenses.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:34:41
Yeah, but how does he pay it *now*?
He said never dollars ever again.

Usury: the illegal action or practice of lending money at unreasonably high rates of interest.
So OP has no idea how to use words.

If you’re drunk or on hallucinogens, user name checks out.

Congrats, we're at 8600. Time to buy.

I buy through Robinhood because that’s where my stocks are, but that’s only for investing. It’s not as functional as buying from an actual exchange, so you can’t use it, but trades of stocks and crypto are free. DM me for a referral code if you want a free stock (won’t post it in public because I’m sure that’s not allowed)
