That would have been his public key, which you want to show to others so they can deposit money. The private key is supposed to be kept secret, so showing on TV would be a mistake.

Quite right, this is m-of-n using SSS (Shamirs Sharing Secret) and not multi-sig. Multi-sig is utilising the scripting capabilities of the BlockChain and is far more powerful and believed to be more secure than m-of-n as the separate private keys don't need to come together at any point - I.e. a potential point of attack

The software linked to at the end of this article  may help, if the items to be recovered are not encrypted or compressed &amp; you know a bit about forensics / python

These are despatched without any bitcoins on them - most likely to reduce theft. When you purchase one you get an email with a code allowing you to activate it when it arrives. Only then do they add the funds onto the card. This can be checked by the verification QR / public key on the front. The OPs doesn't seem to have an amount written on the top of the card, which I believe means he elected to add his own amount of BTC to it.

I think most of those faucet sites don't work anymore due to the transactions being too small.

There are two London conferences, one invite only the other free - you're looking at the wrong one. I'm from the UK too and I've never had any problems with LocalBitCoins buying then using escrow &amp; bank transfer - not meeting in person.

Last tine I heard that it was in a completely different context ;)

Its easy to infer that, but its not necessarily correct.

My findings for latest Chrome on Android. My wallet address on the left is longer than the grey box in which it is contained. The text in the box below is also badly wrapped. There is a lot of white space below the content. No feedback when incorrect BTC address is input or value above available funds is chosen. Otherwise, worked as expected.

I thought [this was already]( part of the protocol, it's just not supported very well by the present wallets?

I visited this site last week - I remember it saying something like 'for best functionality, please install missing plug ins'. I thought it funny at the time. I don't run Java so hopefully I was safe

Look ace. I'm assuming the python runs on a separate computer? Or is it one if those funky new arduinos with WiFi &amp; Linux onboard? Good work anywsy

I've got a Jalapeno coming to the UK as well (although I'm a long way down the queue). I would be interested in hearing how long they take to get delivered and how the custom charges, delivery company / royal mail are.

From the JSON on the web page it looks like it uses blockchain.info wallet.

Is it 2040 or 2140 that the coins stop - I've seen both stated?

1/78th of 2.2 GH/s miner is a 27.82 MH/s miner. Which would mine 0.01 BTC in 2 weeks at the present difficulty.

Whatever this is, its not available from the UK :(
