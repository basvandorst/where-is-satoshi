Here from r/all, this makes bitcoin seem pretty pointless. Money that’s extremely expensive to use, slow to use, and fluctuates a lot...
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:35:04
Bitcoin is no longer a currency in m opinion. It's a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:44:51
I meant it's more like a stock or an investment. Didn't mean to say it was a stock. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:15:17
So people using bitcoin reduces its value? Currency of the future.

Each and every website would have to support bitcoin. I’d wager even if Bitcoin became a better currency, it would be years before they’d rival PayPal in website support.

So the other digital currencies have extremely low fees, is that just a result from lack of transactions in comparison? The rising fees just seem like they would be a hefty deterrent in future viability.

I'm new to bitcoin and was looking to start putting some money into it but does this mean if I start slowly and only buy small amounts at first, that whenever I try and use it I'll have to pay a large fee? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:50:58
I think I may just pass. None of this inspires any confidence whatsoever. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:55:34
So... like all crypto?

Bitcoin is never going to be a real currency that people actually use but here we are.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:01:27
Yeah but you also have to take into account that you need the internet and the places where BTC could help the most, internet isn't guaranteed.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:58:04
On the flipside, Bitcoin seems terrible as a buyer because I have zero protection.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:47:38
I didn’t realize we needed abject poverty to be productive.

When they refused to release leaks on Russia and weren’t taking any information for a time unless it was related to the US Election and only released information on Clinton despite stating they had information on Trump.
Not to mention spreading stupid conspiracies and being against the Panama papers.

Except when he withheld truths because it didn’t fit his narrative. You lose the “truth card” when you pick and choose what truths.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:47:46
It already is.

How is it as secure? I’ve always heard about lightning network but it has never actually been explained. Sounds like a scam or MLM at this point.

My prior soda investment went well. I just wanted to move into a less liquid financial position.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:57:28
So can I keep my BTC on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:00:47
What if I’m 27. Should I just put all my money in Werthers Originals and be done with it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:56:47
I fee that could have explosive consequences if I don’t first drain my investments a bit.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:46:31
Like you’re buying a Coinbase gift card that’s refundable. You transfer $500 to your coinbase account so you can buy $500 of BItcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:44:09
Just bought $20 lol. Need to wait for my bank account to link and I’ll start buying per paycheck too
