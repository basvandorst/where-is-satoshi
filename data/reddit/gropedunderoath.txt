We made deal. If this guy really cared about crypto, we would have seen this awhile back. It’s very scammy when someone is asking about quality and the guy is like oh yeah, best quality..doesn’t even tell you fabrics. These are garbage and basic af. Literally just copied shit

Why sell when it passes ATH lol? You know it’s mooning then
@_date: 2019-06-10 07:23:42
Right. BCC isnt even worth zero. My understanding is Bitcoin has never, ever been zero
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:27:49

You gotta be crazy to think this isn’t going to hit an ATH here shortly.

If only I had a time machine haha. Thanks for the comment, was having a down day and this made me crack a smile. Surprised it wasn’t taken.

Like you can’t withdraw what you “own” to a wallet. You can’t spend it or anything. It’s like an iou from RH. You’re not buying the real thing.

How do you protect from dollar loss?

No sell off. Someone or something fk’d up 5000BTC

Excuse me? My comment was strictly on the coding, which was crucial. Don’t be an idiot, pay attention to the words said. Be better

Tbh BAT is pretty cool, well at least the idea behind it when it rolls out on Brave
@_date: 2019-05-18 10:21:08
When the viewers from 60 M start getting involved things should get interesting lol. Gonna be so much confusion. I really don’t know, the 5000 BTC sell off was way below mp so I would give a few days to correct but honestly I still say buy. Bottoms in.

What’s with the editing in the photo?

How can you say that when Bitcoin has proven to be a legitimate currency? I can only imagine this comes from someone who hasn’t spent any nor had any. Wake up..you can buy whatever you want in Bitcoin.

1. Dumb. A little over half the world has access. Mr. Amazon and Mr. E are going to change that. Internet, won’t be a problem. 
2. Cash doesn’t require electricity? Can you tell me how cash is made? Pretty sure it uses electricity. To top that off, when it’s stored or received at any retail location they use electricity. 
The rest of your points are currently in progress, adapting. I’m pretty sure your “cash” already fkin converted to “electronic funds” do you get paid in cash (the majority don’t) Most people either get a check, which you go to the bank and use some electricity or automatic deposit which, if you want cash you have to use electricity to get it. The majority have already switched off “cash”.It sounds like you watch a lot of tv and probably a lot of manipulative ads so I wouldn’t suggest BTC to you because it does sound like you’d lose it all.BTC is for freedom, people that want more control over their hard earned work, it requires discipline. I’m my own customer service. I’m available on Saturday’s all day and Sundays. Most banks don’t have 24/5. You won’t get a person after X time. Credit card companies, yeah they do..but that’s credit, not cash.Your banks are currently working on their own cryptos because of the technology behind it as well as Amazon. Also, I’m pretty sure theft or losing cash happens all the time, way more than BTC.

Like the part where they actually pay you for watching ads or the free signup they gave
