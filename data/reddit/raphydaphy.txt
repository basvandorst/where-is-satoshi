Same, I'm probably still stupid but at least better than @ 18k like I was going too a few days ago ;)

The majority of people here aren't likely rich in BTC, and your post history would be enough to identify you if was used to find you anyway. There is not even a publicly visible way to see if you are subbed to anything, so really that will archive nothing.

Hey, I've been trying to buy some bitcoin mostly just for fun since I feel I am too late to this to get any decent increase in price (if any), but after depositing some money in AUD to cex.io, trying to buy bitcoin either using the Withdraw menu and choosing Bitcoin as a currency or here  The first method gave me the issue in the image I posted, where the minimum amount I could buy was 0.01 but when entering that it told me the maximum was 0.0 and therefore was impossible to use. The buy/sell link, however, simply told me "There was an error while placing your order: Invalid amount". Anyone else have this issue or know if I am doing something wrong? I have already deposited a couple hundred dollars to cex.io so it would be a shame if I couldn't exchange it for bitcoins.

I know! I was thinking of cashing out some of my savings since bitcoin is currently doing really well and then I realised that this is a currency, not shares, and I should use it to buy things
edit: your comment just said "Nice!" when I replied to it

it was only $4 out of a $120 payment so it really wasn't a big deal but I'll keep that in mind for future purchases
