Good point. For the same reasons we created kryptologika.com - an alternative to CEX. Basically it is silver backed hashing power exchange platform. When buying GH/s you also invest in physical silver thus the value of the shares will never fall to zero no matter what high maintenance costs would be.
Please find our thread on bitcointalk:
Your comments are welcome.
Once you start a bitcoin business you stop worrying about prices ups and downs.

He kicks Lawsky's butt and we keep on promoting our new platform: kryptologika.com
Why? Beckause it is a kickass among the cloud hashing plankton.
We have combined mining bitcoins with mining physical silver. No joke! You can buy shares, keep them, sell them, buy them back.... whatever you like! We have competitive prices, reasonable maintenance fees and lots of TH/s to share with you! We are also promoting investing in physical silver, each TH/s is backed by 1 Oz of pure silver in the form of bullion coins (1GH/s = 0.001 Oz).

the guy has a sense of humour of 5 yo. apart from that what has he to offer? A regulation that will basically put NY state and people who live there out of game and all the garage entepreneurs in that state out of game as well. this is the final result of his work. bitcoin cannot be regulated because it will find ways to baypass the regulations seeing regulations as a glitch or error in the system. perhaps some form of self reguation would be better. for example a system of credentials or licenses issued by some overseeing body (probably not the bitcoin foundation) looking on the most crucial aspects of the crypto business of the applicant. or just a system of indemnity insurance. regulation is not needed then. if the business fails the customers claims should be satisfied by the insurers. or something like that.... but no bitlicense. the costs of such insurance is another story but those businesses would gain more trust then.
