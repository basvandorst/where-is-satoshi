The person using circle can also just send it directly to your bitcoin address. You dont need that extra step
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:34:53
Yeah don't confuse it with all bitcoin users though. Users who had their btc on the bitfinex website are affected. But if your btc were not on bitfinex you are not affected at all. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:18:53
Well the previous ledger wallets did not have a screen. So I like that the nano s has the screen, the fact that it supports btc and eth, and it also has support for other apps like fido 2 factor
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:56:41
I also just got the ledger nano s. Love it so far.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:35:47
I do this already. I used to use bitwage now i just buy manually.  But I don't really see a reason not to if you can afford it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:03:37
Buy from coinbase or circle if in the US
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:51:35
The reason for me was that bitwage sends you the bitcoin a day after payday. I can just buy off circle for pretty much the same exchange rate but get it instantly. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:40:31
It needs USB to access ur ledger. Camera to scan qr codes. Notifications for transactions. Websites for when u click a bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:03:53
I do this with my sister all the time. All the sender has to do is send to ur btc address. Circle takes care of converting their debit card funds to btc when it's sent

If you are in the USA buy off coinbase or circle. Transfer the coins to a wallet you control. Such as Mycelium, Airbitz or Copay. Then learn how to backup the wallet. Done.

@_date: 2016-03-24 19:35:58
Maybe it will not be reversible. My simple point is that there will not be a long term benefit for the miners to do this. If the holders are gone then so is the miners business. So yes maybe they could destroy all faith in the network but that would also mean destroying their business. Mutually assured destruction is the way I see and understand it.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:43:01
I don't think bitcoin was ever intended to replace your credit card 
@_date: 2016-03-02 21:05:49
This is what any good wallet should do. And yes the old address is still fine to send and receive but addresses should absolutely not be reused.
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:13:27
I am guessing you haven't tried to actually transact with anyone using bitcoin yourself. Because if you did you would likely realize this article is just flat wrong. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:35:18
What does my cost basis have to do with whether transactions are going through or not? I have sent more than enough transactions over the past few days to know that payments are not failing worldwide.
@_date: 2016-03-23 23:15:40
If the majority of the bitcoin users did not agree with the change then who would buy the coins?

Also check out airbitz which works on both ios and Android 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:38:59
I really feel like this is being overblown. I have intentionally sent transactions during congested times and they have almost always gone through within 1 to 2 blocks. Alot of issues seem to be related to other things such as unconfirmed inputs and things like that.
@_date: 2016-03-02 06:19:45


This seems to be the most concerning to me if true
edit: meant to include this:


@_date: 2016-03-03 20:41:16
I am also someone who would like more information on this. I've seen the explanations stating there is nothing forcing miners to include transactions. But my understanding is the whole point of the block reward is because of the miners working for the users. So why do we allow a 25 btc reward to a miner who has not processed any transactions? Can't this be changed?
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:54:15
Sure I never said his concerns weren't valid. But even in the situation you described the miner would have to reverse course or go out of business
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:36:56
No I do not think this qualifies as a nightmare at all. I didn't say everything was fine either though. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 16:29:20
I think a nightmare scenario is if you were unable to transact at all or a miner attack or a critical bug in the code. So I guess we can agree to disagree. I don't know what you mean by ignoring and conspiracy theories. No1 is ignoring this problem. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:38:54
Bitcoin was designed for the code to be trusted not people "in charge" 
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:27:48
Could it be changed so that an empty block just doesn't disperse a reward?
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:39:27
Exactly my thoughts. A bunch of non sense from people who have never even used it. And im not understanding how these articles are gaining so much traction. Anyone who actually uses bitcoin knows the sky is not falling. This situation while not ideal is far from a "nightmare." Very far from it.
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:59:17
This seems like a horrible attitude and I don't know why this is allowed by the protocol but maybe it's just a lack of understanding on my part? 
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:38:52
I agree with this completely. There does happen to be some non sense comments in that thread. I didn't mean every comment was non sense and didn't mean for it to come across that way

In my opinion its the speed of withdrawals. If you are using a good site you can usually get pretty close to instant deposits and withdrawals. In fiat gambling you cash out and wait what 3 to 5 days for the money to hit your bank account? With bitcoin you can withdraw your winnings and then go spend them at overstock all in the same day
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:50:25
looks pretty obvious to me

This would not be a profitable situation for the miners. Miners are sellers of bitcoin. Not buyers. Miners would be committing economic suicide if they unilaterally pushed through a change users did not agree with.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:05:58
someone kinda hinted at this in a comment below.....

It is not their fault. Your government requires them to get this information from you.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:01:15
Circle has two options for the wallet. You can choose to keep your funds in USD or BTC. You are likely set to the USD option.
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:02:48
I have used them for sells before. Hit my bank quickly I was happy. I don't buy from them since there are instant options.

When was bitcoin ever expected to be instant? Blocks have always been found an average of every 10 mins this is not new. Also It has always been the case that this is an AVERAGE. No matter how big blocks are it doesn't change the fact that it could take 5 mins or 30 mins or even longer for miners to even mine a block. Where in bitcoins design has "instant" ever been a feature?
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:31:27
It was 5 bucks man what are you mad about?
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:44:03

@_date: 2016-06-23 03:50:44
Good call
@_date: 2016-06-12 14:13:55
You can hold in coinbase. But the whole point of bitcoin is being your own bank. Having your coins on coinbase is like keeping your funds in a bank. If they dont like what you do with the money they can shut your account down. Keeping your funds in copay or another wallet is like having your funds in your home safe. You can do what you want and you are the only one who has control over the funds.

I believe they use a zero knowledge open source system so I do not believe they have access to your coins. I use airbitz myself  and they have been heavily reviewed But I am no expert so thats the best answer I can give. You can also use copay or mycelium if you want.

Coinbase does store them for you yes. They buy off an exchange and are also your wallet. Once you buy off coinbase you just download another wallet app and transfer to the wallet address provided by the new app. And yes coinbase charges a fee this is not a fault of bitcoin. Coinbase must make money in order to operate. There are fees point blank. The miner fees however are not very expensive and you will realize they are well worth the convenience once you see how easy it is to send money to another bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-08-13 22:40:42
If you want to get bitcoin instantly you need to use coinbase or circle and also have a credit card. If I am wrong or anyone has a better way chime in

I agree I think the mistake is still pricing bitcoin in terms of dollars. If bitcoins were to become that valuable or widely adopted we would not be saying 1 bitcoin is worth a million dollars. We would say im buying a car with 50mBTC or something like that. Items prices would be denominated in bitcoin.

As long as I can send bitcoin to someone without needing a bank or third party approval I will continue to use bitcoin. Whether the price is 5 dollars or 500.
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:01:30

Well like mentioned above you guys need to balance getting users and profiting from the site. And I understand that. I can't pretend to know what the magic number will be but there has to be an advantage to playing here over draftkings or fanduel apart from accepting bitcoin.

Man you are better off getting a hardware wallet if your gonna do all that. You can get a ledger for relatively cheap and not need to worry about all that. 
@_date: 2016-09-30 13:52:31
Send it to your ledger. That's all you need to do. Your ledger has it own backup which is the 24 words. No need for that 1 specific private key.

I dont even normally watch the show but happened to have it on and caught that. Pretty cool exchange there. That guy looks just like jack lew lol
@_date: 2016-09-23 01:53:25
It's a USB device you plug into your computer. It keeps the keys offline. There are plenty of threads on hardware wallets. But to keep it short u get great security for the cost. It is more than worth it. They are simple and easy to use.

It is the second aspect of bitcoin that has led to such recent headlines as "Big banks consider using Bitcoin blockchain technology" and, of course, Bloomberg's piece from September 1 in which "Blythe Masters Tells Banks the Blockchain Changes Everything."
I think this is a very good and valid point
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:23:46
You can just read the sidebar it tells you exactly what bitcoin is. You can buy bitcoin off coinbase or circle.
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:08:22
This is a ridiculous statement imo
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:19:49
I would say Airbitz is likely the easiest to use with good security
@_date: 2015-09-09 17:54:58
The price of bitcoin is the least important thing to me. I fear that the push for mass adoption will push bitcoin away from being decentralized and secure. Dont get me wrong I want bitcoin to grow to be greater than it is now. I just dont want its core benefits compromised. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:46:37
There is a new one  but it is the only one i know of. I really wish DK accepted bitcoin.

There is a subreddit for bitcoin beginners but no mining is not profitable. litecoin is a different cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:45:33
Ah I see. Coinbase and circle I believe both allow this. I'm in the US though so not sure if it also works in Europe. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:36:39
Bitfinex had a few technical issues that affected some peoples ability to trade and place orders so alot of people switched.
@_date: 2015-09-26 04:27:57

coinbase or circle. Then transfer to another wallet you have more control over.

Yeah I haven't had any issues with any transactions all month
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:33:07

When mobile payments become more popular will that be something that potentially leads to more bitcoin consumer payments?

Surprised to see some very good comments below the article
@_date: 2015-09-07 19:18:53
It's not diluting the market. 21 million coins is 21 million coins. That's like saying dividing a dollar into 4 quarters creates more money. Money has to be divisible. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:12:57
I use bitwage here in the USA. The payment processor would not be direct deposit. For example mine is ADP. It appears on my pay stub and is also the online portal I use to view pay stubs

You actually believe this or are you being sarcastic?

@_date: 2015-09-09 02:19:30
I just love the fact that bitcoin gives me full control. Its my money. I send it to whoever, whenever without needing any other approval or 3rd party. And its not affiliated with any government. I agree with nookbrooke. Control and independence!
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:33:35
Provident is what I would use
@_date: 2015-09-27 21:06:35
Yeah my bad I was too focused on the volatility part and overlooked the escrow needs.

I used airbitz and my transaction went through fairly quickly as well. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:14:27
I cant see how a web wallet with no login would be secure in any way. If he is new to bitcoin you should be suggesting the wallet. Once he sees how it works then he can fiddle around and do backups and try different wallets. But in my opinion setting up a wallet like copay if you skip the backup part is easy for even a new user. I have done it with a friend of mine and the process was very quick. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 20:46:23
I agree with sandwich. This article is very poor. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 14:00:59
The most important thing to me is the decentralization. I don't care what the price of bitcoin is. Its the security, the fact that it is not controlled by one person or government. The fact that my wallet cant be closed without my permission. The fact that I can transfer value to anyone, anytime globally. Censorship or some type of government regulation of the protocol are what would make me stop using bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-09-13 03:01:14
bitcoin for currency, gold and silver for savings. If bitcoin was accepted everywhere this is exactly how it would go for me.
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:37:11
I like Airbitz
@_date: 2015-11-19 05:00:14
Just ordered mine. Will see how it goes. Just another reason to buy more bitcoin if this works well.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:45:27
It is not a need to hold bitcoin. Just a personal preference. I agree that this is not the case for most people. Not disputing that at all. I dont use credit cards so no instant buy on coinbase. I get instant on circle but have low limits and bitwage has a better exchange rate usually.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:42:00
I don't really disagree with you at all though just my personal use.
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:57:11
I have always thought this way as well. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 20:24:17
Of course man. If 1 bitcoin = $400 no 1 is gonna buy yours for 618. If you own a share in apple stock and its goes from being worth $97 down to $90. Your share is only worth $90. Bitcoin is no different than any other asset traded on an open market when it comes to this. 
@_date: 2015-09-14 00:37:47


Im not sure what you mean by this? There is no form of money that adds new wealth. Work and production create wealth. Money is just the unit of account on that wealth regardless of whether it is bitcoin, gold, or dollars.
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:10:31
I'm not buying this bs. None of my bits will be reserved at uphold
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:41:54
Bitcoin already is regulated by the developers and users of the network. Bitcoin already has rules written into the protocol. This is the only regulation it needs imo. Government regulators will always move slower than the technology.
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:35:55
I think bitcoin has more potential for retail adoption when mobile payments take off more. They would likely look the same in practice I imagine. Maybe its just me living in a smaller sized city but not only do i never see anyone pay with bitcoin, I never see anyone make any type of mobile payment at all.
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:40:41
You are correct the above is not true. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:46:02
Not a fan of coinbase either. But you still dont have to use them as your primary wallet. I view myself just transferring to coinbase prior to using the card. Will allow me to hold much more bitcoin without having to worry about selling 2 to 5 days in advance if funds are needed.
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:41:57
Yeah I believe when sending from coinbase they cover the fee I think 
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:33:30
Yes bitwage
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:29:05
This to me really isnt much different than a merchant using bitpay. Yes my btc are being converted into dollars when I pay but at least it allows me to hold BTC if it is my personal preference. Basically it allows me to hold in bitcoin and convert to dollars when needed rather than the other way around.
@_date: 2015-11-09 03:51:26
This pretty much sums it up in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 23:08:38

You actually read those? It seems impossible to follow. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:18:37
My point is walking into a store and using it isn't its only source of value. The number of bitcoin transactions continues to increase. So obviously people are using it. If you are arguing that it hasn't reached mass adoption I wouldn't argue with that. Its obviously much easier to use for payment online than in a store currently but that doesn't mean it has no real world value
edit: spelling mistakes
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:32:56
I have used it and it works well so far
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:36:35
The benefit to me is being able to hold my funds in the currency of my choice (bitcoin) without having to sell and wait 2 to 5 days to make a fiat only purchase. This is more for ideological reasons and a personal preference not for financial benefit or gain.
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:37:20
I find them to usually be a few cents cheaper than circle. They are usually about $2 or so over exchange prices.
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:00:30
I use nitrogen
@_date: 2015-11-20 20:38:15
You do not have to convert to coinbase USD. That is done on the fly. The user is not required to do that. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:26:23
I have 3 wallets on my phone. Airbitz, mycelium and copay and I cant figure out which one i want to use as my primary wallet

It will be bad. No question about it. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:03:02
Isn't this not even an option? It's for exchanges or big volume companies only right? Liquid is not for an individual user so moving to liquid is not an option for most or am I misunderstanding?

I have never heard of either of these services hurting your credit score. And I use them myself. Your not taking out a loan or signing up for any monthly payments so I'm not sure what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:36:59
If you are in the US use circle or coinbase. Then transfer coins to the wallet of your choosing.
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:20:21
Well dont get me wrong I dont think this is an ideal solution. It just makes a couple things easier in my specific case. I already use bitwage because I dont have to deal with the limits of circle or wait times of coinbase. In order to pay my rent I then have to sell some bitcoin a few days in advance in order to have my rent money. With this debit card I can forget about needing to sell days in advance. I can just pay my rent using the card. Yes if you are already holding fiat then by all means its obviously easier to just pay your rent in fiat. But if you ONLY have bitcoin then this is useful.
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:40:45
So bitcoin is not useful but it wasn't possible without bitcoin? Did I read that right?
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:44:09
Someone correct me if im wrong but I believe you can have an expanding coin supply and it still be deflationary no? As long as there are less coins created than there are goods and services produced or is this wrong? 
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:28:01
I would narrow it down to Airbitz, Copay and Mycelium. Try each one and see what you like as far as interface and features.
@_date: 2015-10-14 12:13:00
Considering they don't believe in bitcoin at all I can't bring myself to use their service 
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:12:36
I have been using it and it works great. The exchange rate isn't the greatest but I love the service. Easy to use and support gets back to you quickly if you have any questions.
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:02:24
Im not smart enough to know the answer to this. But I am very pro bitcoin and the 21 mil limit has never struck me as a deal breaker where I would just sell all my coins if it was changed. It depends on the scenario. If I believed it was handled responsibly and it was a consensus change and bitcoin would still be deflationary over the long term I would have no problem with it. But if I felt like we were heading down a different path then I would likely sell. I just dont believe it should be an automatic pitchfork moment
@_date: 2015-10-12 19:28:43
Interesting 
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:58:54
Sorry overlooked that. I cant answer because i have never been in an insufficient funds scenario. I will just point out that the double spending is a problem everyone is having. There have been multiple posts about it. But all of my transactions have gone through and confirmed just fine. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 02:50:58
Have you used this? The fact that its in alpha scares me a bit but considering trying it
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:24:44
I agree it is pretty cool. Should be a very useful feature when fully functional 
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:37:46
Copay also has integrated this feature. Looking forward to this coming out of beta.
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:40:33
I have been using them for 3 or 4 months
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:15:24


No you are not. What is your point? If people stop using google products and services the value of its shares will go down. If people stop using the bitcoin blockchain the value of its token will go down. And vice versa. Whats the difference?
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:29:19
Then get another wallet and spend to it?
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:03:17
Just send it from coinbase to whatever wallet you want 
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:52:49
I am curious though what got you interested in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-16 17:24:45
Completely agree 
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:11:28
I feel this helps the crazy ones (like me potentially lol) who envision living entirely off bitcoin. Which would be at great volatility risk of course. But this allows you to say receive your entire check in bitcoin via bitwage and continue to hold in bitcoin while spending when needed. For example if i need to pay my rent and have only bitcoin i need to worry about selling a few days in advance to have the dollars available. This card would eliminate that step. A transfer to coinbase takes an hour and its done.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:57:27
Circle is absolutely fine for buying. I wouldn't recommend using it as a wallet. But buying there is fine.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:19:58
Its an HD wallet. your going to get a new address. And why do you have to spend it? All you have to do is verify it on a block explorer.
@_date: 2015-10-06 00:41:09
I have seen this many times before with various other companies
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:54:46
The integration is there the option is already in my wallet. Are you a copay user? It showing for you? 
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:48:46
I agree really surprised by all the negativity around this
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:22:47
Why do you earn interest? because you take on counter party risk by leaving your money in the bank. You don't earn interest on physical dollars in your wallet. Same with bitcoin. But if you want to go loan them out for interest you can choose to do so.
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:35:46
I believe it does mention the states I do remember checking mine. With that said I do have some privacy concerns. I sent an email asking if they collected any info like transaction history or anything else and have not heard back yet. I will also say I sold a small portion of bitcoin and the money was in my account literally within a day or 2. So that part went really well. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:18:22
Overstock.com is probably the most popular place 
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:55:46
It should be pointed out that this is a feature. Not a bug. Any good wallet does this. Addresses really shouldn't be re used 
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:57:24
No i would definitely recommend them 
@_date: 2015-10-22 14:47:51
I think one thing we need that would also likely cause a major price move is for a major grocery chain in the US to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:51:21
Both the 8 and the 4 will go through. The problem is each 1 of those transactions actually has a copy due to the attack. So the 8 transaction is being sent twice and so is the 4. Both transactions will go through as planned and the duplicates will not.
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:04:00
I don't think you need to be a sucker to think that a censorship resistant payment network has real world value. Its not just about buying bananas
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:11:23
I agree with this point so much. I know so many people who rarely even hear the word decentralized in their daily lives. Explaining the benefits of bitcoin which to me are its decentralized open characteristics really come across as foreign concepts to alot of people.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:54:43
I pretty much do this same thing. I prefer the shift card from coinbase because it keeps the balance in BTC. But there is no denying its a risk. I do it because I am comfortable taking that risk. It has worked out well for me so far. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 04:28:16
Same here
@_date: 2016-07-29 20:16:21
Man there's no way to avoid fees like that when ur making such small purchases. The best option is to do what was suggested and buy once a week or something like that. Fees are gonna kill you if u buy $2 worth every day doesn't matter where 
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:29:26
OP already has his account linked thats not what he was asking. His credit card is no longer linked so he was looking for an instant buy
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:05:47
Simple man just send a small amount to test first
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:42:20
One of your transactions will go through as it should and the other will not because it's a double spend. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:58:58
Love to see posts like this absolutely awesome. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 10:57:07
Can you just send them to a different wallet? 
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:27:27
You can also send to coinbase from any external wallet. Not sure im seeing the difference?
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:28:22

It is not any different in your situation. An example use of the usd wallet would be If you sold some bitcoin and intended to buy back later. The proceeds from the sale would go into the usd wallet and then your next purchase using the usd wallet would be instant.
EDIT: If you are in the US you should be able add a debit card for an instant buy I think that is live for everyone now also
@_date: 2016-07-12 01:44:25
I have used Airbitz on android for a while. Its a good wallet. The open bitcoin privacy report ranked it  fairly recently I believe. Airbitz and copay to me are the best android wallets. Mycelium is great too I just hates its UI.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:20:12
Bitcoin has always had smaller denominations and any exchange could already choose to use a different denomination if they wanted to
