That would only happen to an exchange if they lied to account owners about funds available (skimming money off accounts). They make their money off fees, not stealing people's holdings.

No method to recycle old bitcoin that are lost. How would you know what's lost versus what's a longterm HODL anyway? 26 million, tha'ts it. Any lost are lost. Deflationary currency boii.

Please do your research when donating in the biopharm space. A lot of what gets accomplished at universities gets spinned off into the pharma machine to make profits. It's an industry riddled with feel good help the patient fronts that have a back-end of going public and racking in profits. Definitely talk to some subject matter experts here before throwing money at research institutes, universities, and the like. True altruism is hard to come by in pharma/medical research.

Did you send to a segwit address by accident? Pretty sure coinbase doesn't allow that. The fee is so small for litecoin, you should always test with a small amount first before transferring larger sums.
Did you send it to a litecoin wallet on the nano s?

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:14:31
There is no normal for these things now. Exchanges have skyrocketed in users, and they have to do all the usual KYC stuff, so unless coinbase gives you an estimate, I don't think ayone else can give you an accurate one.

Didn't watch the video, because I don't think he's a good resource. If there's an astute financial adviser who also gets bitcoin, go for it. I just don't think he's a good resource. It's like listening to the idiot who just repeats a common sense thing he heard, yanno?

You probably will, when the exchange decides to give it to you. It's up to them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:47:54
Plenty of ways to mine bitcoin. If you aren't going full throttle with a multi-million dollar business plan for it though, you probably won't be making enough to make it worth your while. There are probably better subs to talk about mining, and you can always look into mining alt-coins that have lower barriers to entry.

Just make sure to keep all your records somewhere if you are in a country where buy/sell/trade of crypto is a taxable event that you need to report. For those that think they can get away with not reporting buy/sell/trades, please google KYC and then google tax evasion (more for US people).

You are asking for investment advice. No one here can predict the future, so we can't tell you what will work out versus not work out. Do your own due diligence, and make your own decisions on this sort of thing. Consensus will say, only invest what you can afford to lose and HODL.

Yes, it's taxable once you sell the bitcoin for USD, even if you don't withdraw the USD from coinbase. If you day trade, every time you sell BTC to USD, you are making a taxable event. Coinbase USD is basically a bank account in that sense.

He bought into a mining pool. It'd be the equivalent of you building a rig to mine bitcoin, and running it for year. Instead, he bought the rights to $3,200 worth of hardware to mine for a year (electricity and maintenance included I guess). If that pool yields enough bitcoin from succesful mining, he'll get a bitcoin. Or it won't, and he won't. It could totally fail and he could get zip for his contract. I'd prefer owning the cold, hard coin.

It's like posting your address in a way. Wherever you post it, that address can be tied to whatever else is tied to the social media account you posted it with. So for example..let's say you post a bitcoin address on here. And keep using that bitcoin address elsewhere. Let's say in 5 years you use it and do something illegal with it. If your original post (here) can be tied to your reddit account, I can speculate that that reddit account owner is the culprit. If that reddit account has history that can help me figure out WHO YOU ARE, boom. Get it?

Buying on an exchange is centralized. Let's say you and 10 buddies get together, put all your bitcoin and cash in piles, and trade around. Then settle accounts when you walk away. No btc is transferred until you are done your dealings with your buddies. That's what an exchange does. All the bitcoin is in the exchange's wallets. They can move it around within their users' accounts, and true it up on the blockchain at the end, whenever someone wants to withdraw btc into a wallet. At that point you or the exchange pays the fee required.

If you think % earned on BTC will be higher than % of loan, then it would be prudent to invest in bitcoin. No one knows what % earned on BTC will be for your or any timeframe. If we could answer these questions, we'd be rich and/or we'd know the real price of BTC. :)

You can deposit bitcoin to your coinbase wallet if you want. No issue there. You can deposit or withdraw fiat/bitcoin/litecoin/ethereum. ezpz (there should be a receive address on your bitcoin wallet in coinbase)

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Cost = Amount_btc_purchased * price_point_of_purchase
Revenue = Amount_btc_owned * Going_rate_at_time_of_sale
Profit = Revenue - Cost
You can use the above too. Try making your own google spreadsheet for funsies. Do some googling, and you'll find you can pull in current price of btc into the google spreadsheet.

A private key can make a ton of different public keys. They will all work indefinitely (as long as that blockchain sustains). Most good wallets will do that (give a new receiving public key everytime). If it gives you 100 different addresses, you can still use the first one. I wouldn't do that with an exchange though, only with a wallet where you are in control. If coinbase gives you a new key, just use the new key.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:31:45

Search lost bitcoin on this sub-reddit. Will be tons of posts. First thing to do is search for a file called wallet.dat on the computer. Second thing I would probably do is look at old debit/credit card statements to see what exchange he bought it off of (and if they are still around).

This is my fun little thought experiment: Satoshi comes in to save us by opening LN hubs with his huge stash to majorly reduce congestion. This pivots BTC closer to a global currency.

  * Withdraw what, bitcoin or fiat?
* What things should I be aware of when buying this amount?
  * Take your time, do your research, do small steps before you do big ones, e.g. transfer a little to your own wallet before you transfer a lot.
* What can I do to bypass the $750 debit card limit or to bypass the 2 week wait period for a deposit directly from my bank account? (Probably no solution to this but thought I'd ask).
  * Use multiple exchanges if you want. There's no getting past the limits they set for you unless you have a business account or something.
