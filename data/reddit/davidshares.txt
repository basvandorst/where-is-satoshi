Donation matching is typically done by the company you work for. 
It works like this. Let's say you work for Dell. They may have a philanthropy division that matches employee donations. So if you make a donation to X-charity, it may be eligible for company matching. Kaya's site simply says check with your company to see if you can get your donation matched. Many companies do this. Almost all charities will accept company matching funds.  
Edit: it seems Kaya has a separate matching program for Bitcoin (outside of company matching programs). A "regular donor" of Kaya said they will match Bitcoin donations up to $10K

So basically someone got a bunch of free classes on bitcoin, and then sometime later reversed the PayPal charges. $25K of education? He/She says that the physical items will be "covered" whatever that means. And you can't buy Bitcoin via PayPal, unless I'm missing something?

Hi All, funny this came up today. I was working on an address shortener this week/weekend, and just posted to Reddit (and how I found this thread too). 
My logic was that Blockchain.info is the most trusted bitcoin address (and related info) site for the Bitcoin community. With that logic, I decided not to create a shortener that lands on my site, but redirects to that bitcoin address on Blockchain.info. 
So the person who submits the shortened custom name/URL can easily verify on blockchain.info if it is correct or not, or was changed.
Here's the shortener I made:

I have my reservations about this. I implemented a CoinWidget bitcoin tipping button many months ago [on my website]( which is geared towards a tech audience (and has a large readership), and I even write about bitcoin too. And I have never received one donation via the CoinWidget tip button. I love tipping, and ChangeTip is awesome, but will this explode on other websites/blogs; I'm not so sure about it until bitcoin itself becomes more mainstream.

@_date: 2014-02-26 00:47:11
From my understanding of the TX-malleability issue, txns were very poorly tracked in the Gox system meaning, txns could be sent over and over without Gox being able to keep track of it. Some hacker figured this out and exploited it, a couple years ago! And Gox had been hemorrhaging coins ever since and decided to do nothing about it! 
Also it's obvious Gox was NOT using "cold" storage. They must have lied about it, because it's impossible for coins to "leak" from cold storage.

Yes like in Egypt. But it would only affect that country. AND it would only be those that can't get around it.

Same rules in life apply to bitcoins as with anything else. Do it in the day, with light, in a safe public place. Get there early (first), survey the area. Watch them arrive, get all info, take a photo. During the deal stay aware and ALWAYS set yourself up in a way to get out fast!

The problem is that charities will want to see dollars (fiat). Which means if they aren't into bitcoin, they will need some third party service like BitPay or coinbase. They will have to do some significant work into learning and setting up the accounts, and then have to deal with those third party services and pay them per transaction. 
I say all this as it might dissuade some charities from initially getting involved.

Report the website here: 
This is the website owner on bitcointalk  which runs this website, also linked to on the vanity site 
Edit 2:
This actually came up in Aug2013, but nobody heeded the warnings 
Edit 3: 
This is his/hers Google Analytics ID number: UA-223018-12 (
There is a way to backtrace (yeah yeah i know lol) by the profile number, I just don't know how offhand.
Edit 4: Can't find anything by GA ID it could have been fake to try to make his site look valid to throw people off. I did find this. This *could* be him, but no way to know for sure, but seems probable:  
Edit 5: this is his SE account (which he contributed to one bitcoin answer)  
Edit 6: on  is clearly says at the bottom "Copyright RowIT Ltd." After some  additional searching, this is RowIT Ltd:  whois brings up an address in the UK, but registered under hedge-row.co.uk which is a deadend. again, none of this actually means it's these people. anybody can add something to a website, to throw off users into thinking they are something they aren't. 
More stuff:  
Edit 7: Confirmed that Nibor runs the Rowit.co.uk website, here 
And finally, this has contact info  
Real name Robin? 
Pretty sure now that Nibor on the BitcoinJ Google Forum is the same Nibor on BitcoinTalk, see here where he references the same BitcoinTalk forum post where he is posting in as Nibor:  
Edit 8: Nibor's Github profile: 
Lastly, I have his Google email address if anyone wants to PM me for it. Not sure it would do you any good though. Not sure why he would do this, when clearly he can be tracked by his name. Also, he seems pretty well known in the Bitcoin community (going back to the early days). I'm sorry for anyone that lost BTC due to this.

I meant based in the U.S., that allows buys/sells/trades (which is an exchange). For example, as you said, Coinbase is not an exchange, but is in the U.S. They dont allow trades, only buy/sell, and not in the traditional manner of an exchange. Doing a lot of buys/sells on Coinbase tied to your U.S. bank account will get your bank account shut down.

Doesn't bother me and actually in the spirit of fundraising, that is what it's for. Individually as a single person, we may not be able to cover X-amount of costs for Hal (or anyone with a charitable cause). However, when we come together as a community like this, and do a fundraiser, then each donation combined - no matter the size - in the end we end up with a collective amount that makes a difference. :)

That wasn't until they confiscated them. Before then, why not? After them, why not continue? The Feds clearly have a heavy interest in bitcoins. They would be stupid to not buy or mine them already, knowing the potential it has, especially with the huge spikes in the past year. They are smart; and I'm sure they have at least done some exploratory mining and purchasing prior to DPR seizure.

If I'm reading it correctly, you look at the y-axis (up and down, left column). You start down the list, let's say with the first row, which is laanwj. As you can see, laanwj collaborates the most with sipa. Laanwj collobarates also a lot with sipa, gavin, and so on. He collobarates the least with forrestv for example. The darker the color, the higher the collobaration.

Since you're a dev, figured I'd take the opportunity to ask. I mentioned this in a few other iOS posts before, but it got drowned out.

You can buy anything with fiat, that's correct. So why own bitcoins and be here for bitcoins if you're not interested in building it up?? It's new, so until more services and vendors are developed, things aren't always going to be as easy in the beginning.

That's the problem. The goal is to lock-in users, so leaving is so much of an ordeal, that you don't leave. 
This is even more of an issue with bitcoin. Because it's money, even more important than identity, and with some of the complexities of wallets, having a laymans wallet to make it simple is very appealing to the general public. Once Circle, or whoever,  pulls you in (has control over your private keys, etc), then you're locked in and most likely won't leave the service.

I agree with you, but by reading the criminal complaint it was more than just knowing that bitcoins were going to be used to purchase drugs; it was that he continued to use his business to help FAIELLA do the illegal transactions on SR, thereby making SHREM a co-conspirator for these illegal transactions. I'm sure if his lawyer is really good he will get off with lesser charges but this entire thing is clearly a witchhunt towards Bitcoins. Obviously the FEDS are making their position known now.

They can't. They can only state that they shouldn't use/spend/trade/destroy the 218 BTC. Apparently they think they know the address that possesses the 218 BTC. What's lacking to me is the bitcoin address in this document. Without that, the defendant can just say "prove it" and how will they prove that the 218btc belongs to them? 
Edit: they also need to prove they have the private key to use the 218 btc. Maybe they "lost" it or pull a MtGox and say it was hacked.

I would actually recommend a static bitcoin donation address instead of using a service like BitPay. BitPay uses unique addresses which  is great for user privacy. 
However, nonprofits are held under another light, a light that many shy away from: transparency. 
You as a nonprofit can lead the way to help nonprofits be transparent with their donations, have one static bitcoin address to donate to, and allow the world to see the address on the block chain and see how funds are utilized. 
This also allows you to fundraise with clarity, showing your goal is X-dollars, for Y-cause.

@_date: 2014-03-24 18:10:53
That's not completely true. CC's can be used in that way that you talk about now. If I'm a thief I can easily go to a Dept Store and spend a stolen CC without any problems, until it's reported as stolen...I could even go to an ATM if I know the PIN# and withdraw cash.

I'm not disagreeing with anything you've said. Gox is a shitstorm going down faster than a whore in the night. But that doesn't negate the fact that they still have real btc bought by real people on their hardly, but still shittily functioning, exchange. Meaning until they shut down and close their doors, they are still an exchange. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:55:35

This address send coins in 2011 around the time the exchange changed owner to Mark Karpeles 
1EuMa -&gt; 1FBiC -&gt; 1B4AW -&gt; 1Kq6s -&gt; 1K66U -&gt; 1pdMA
These coins were split into blocks of 2-5k which were used as cold storage.
The 1pdMA coins (plus the rest) didn't move until 2013-12-21 and 2014-02-05 as part of a huge movement of old coins following the same pattern. These coins are mapped in two spreadsheets here and here totaling ~300k coins.
Two of the MtGox cold storage addresses moved as shown:
1PNNF -&gt; 1JFXQ -&gt; 1DJoA -&gt; 1PAzo
14MiN -&gt; 1HsUP -&gt; 1KnPn -&gt; 1PAzo
I know that 1PAzo is an address owned by Bitstamp and i assume that 1DJoA and 1KnPn also are Bitstamp addresses used to receive coins from customers. This shows that the MtGox cold storage coins moved directly from cold storage to an unknown address and then to a Bitstamp address. There are an estimate of 13500 coins moved to Bitstamp as of this moment.

Well, I would never switch anything like your saying, but I understand the problem. Also, that would be a tremendous amount of work to go and sign every Blockchain.info address after supposedly "switching" them, one by one. It would be a futile thing to do in my opinion. 
What solution do you offer then? Until it's built into the protocol, with some sort of vanity address, there will always be this issue your talking about. 
Also, for address tags, you can tag them to a website. So it would be impossible to "switch" a tag to an already verified website if I didn't have access to that website.

I may have messed with my account somehow, but Coinbase support is no help in answering my questions.
I have my account, and was able to login fine.
I then today, added a second "business" account (using another email). I was able to login fine to that too. But on this new second business account, I added my phone number for verification. Ever since then, I can not login to EITHER account. 
I'm wondering if by having the same phone number on two accounts, it's breaking my 2FA? But if that is the case, why can't Coinbase Support help! I swear, sometimes they are useless. All they did was blame Authy. But when I contact Authy, they say Authy is working fine.
Coinbase Support also told me to "reset" my phone number with Authy, which I did. Now later, I'm reading that it might take a few days to "reset." So thanks a lot Coinbase for that suggestion.

One would think he would have been pretty stupid to give his private keys to the FBI, knowing full well he would never see his btc again.

The only other possibility that I would accept is that there is some random hacker out there screwing with us all, and was able to hack Satoshi's Ning account (so quickly too after this news came out today). I just don't buy Dorian has had the time today to do it. He's been too preoccupied.

It's been like that for a while. There was some issue with sending change to another address some time ago. MtGox did a test transfer where coins were sent to two outputs, that one you linked to being one of them. So those coins are a double spend.

TOKYO-The chief executive of Bitcoin trading platform Mt Gox shows remorse. He apologized "many times for any delay in our replies," Mark Karpeles said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. At the same time, he refused to give details for the protection of customer deposits.
In the conducted via e-mail interview, Karpeles remained silent to the growing concern among customers about the financial circumstances of the Bitcoin platform. He wanted to rule only on technical issues, said the CEO. The platform had payouts with set reference to technical problems for over a week on ice .

The site of Mt Gox.
"We understand your concerns on this issue," Karpeles wrote in the e-mail Monday. "All of the information to customers but are confidential."
On Monday, Mt Gox published on its website a statement , according to which a solution to the problems was found and "withdrawals will be soon possible." Payments should, however, be resumed in reduced speed. Moreover, it is new daily and monthly limits on withdrawals give to prevent problems.
The company's customers are pushing the platform to publish more information about their financial condition. On Monday at Mt Gox Bitcoin were traded at a substantial discount of more than half compared to other Bitcoin exchanges - a clear sign of distrust of the market.
Questions after the bankruptcy stay open
In the e-mail to the Wall Street Journal, the French manager responded to questions about the financial solvency of the company several times with the reference to the fact that such information was confidential. The company has, however, its business model agreed with Japanese authorities "to ensure that we move within the law," he wrote.

Bitcoin glitch puts the market in a panic
Mt Gox has struggled since July due to technical problems, as the platform for the first time put dollar payouts on ice. On 7 February, the company put all of sudden withdrawals froze and made this mistake in the Bitcoin software responsible.
Three days later, Mt Gox was damaged by its own account through fraudulent payment orders for which a function of the Bitcoin protocol called "transaction malleability" has been abused, which allows of updating the checksum of an already implemented Bitcoin transaction.
Problem with the "transaction malleability"
Initially, many argued in the Bitcoin community that Mt Gox was simply failed to take the necessary internal measures to protect their own accounts against manipulation by the "transaction malleability", an already long-known and deliberately created function in Bitcoin protocol.
The very next day, the problem expanded, however, because hackers a previously unknown bug in the special software of major trading exchanges exploited to overwhelm them with a wave of manipulated transactions.
When asked why the company did not respond sooner to the concerns of customers, Karpeles replied: "I suppose you refer to the malleability problem. We sincerely apologize for this incident. Please be aware, however, that we are NOT the developers of Bitcoin. "When trading platform Mt Gox trying" to do our best to repair the problems and make it better for our customers. " Mt Gox've been struggling with a problem that was "known since 2011, but was overlooked by the Bitcoin developers," he added. "We are very surprised that somebody Mt Gox can be blamed for it instead of Bitcoin Software. "

The issue I can see with this is BitPay takes X% off of each payment they send for bitcoins received. That cost has to then be transferred over to the donors making the gifts. So your lets say $100 donation might end up being $96 (4%, just a guess) due to administrative fees from BitPay. Then I bet Click and Pledge has their own admin fees already per transaction. Add that in and maybe that is another 3% deduction. Now your $100 gift is really $93. 
A lot of donors would be turned off that 7% of their donation is deducted for admin fees. I don't know if my %'s are accurate but I do know BitPay charges admin fees for payouts. These fees will more than likely be paid by the donors. 
In an ideal situation, a company like pledge and click would be able to develop their own payment gateway and not use BitPay. Then offset the costs using their normal admin fee of X% per transaction.

Also, I checked IRS and they aren't even listed as a registered NPO, both accepted or rejected, which is puzzling. Why aren't they listed in the IRS database?
Lastly, and just an FYI as I learned something about the btc foundation, is that they are a 501c6, which means...


So if you donate it's not tax deductible AND the foundation is forbidden from lobbying for bitcoins (something I thought they were *supposed* to be doing).

This could actually be good news. Auctions are almost always less than market value so bitcoiners will be able to buy them at a lesser value than what they are actually worth. And at least they aren't being converted to fiat. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:30:03
IF they fix their issues, and people are finally able to get money out of Gox, your going to see a good number of people trying to panic sell, which will keep the price down.

any sort of generic information, emails, pamphlets, hand outs that were provided to everyone, you can share. stuff that was directed to you, don't share or risk identifying yourself. if you are not sure if you are the only contractor, then don't do it as you could be the only one. if you know for a fact there are a number, then go for it. but expect them to find out and possibly fire all contractors, and start fresh later.

What has worked for me in the past is to build up the acct first. Make sure it's several days old, has been RT'd and mentioned several times, has followers and followed users back, basically seemingly a real acct. then you can go and  users as much as you want and not get flagged.

The answer is that coinbase gets them from a few top exchanges.

The draft clearly was accurate. Also I don't think 2bit started out with malice, but in a place where he had inside info that he chose to release, as he felt morally he had to - which was the right thing to do. 
But his most recent "demands" and constant teasers leave much to be desired and is quickly turning into a circus. 
He needs to pull his reigns back and relax, and stop trying to be a hero. If he has more insider info, "do the right thing" again and stop playing with people's emotions and lives.

I realize that, but when they have literally millions upon millions of dollars in VC funding, having poor support doesn't cut it when dealing with other people's money.

I would have to disagree with that. If the post being shared lets say is about how bitcoin is impacting technology (Blockchain, ASICS, protocols, etc), it deserves to be in as much as the other posts. 
If the post is about bitcoin prices, speculation, and the market, then yeah sure that should not be @_date: 2014-01-14 17:12:38

Coinbase has improved their security a lot recently. Before they had 2FA for login only, and kept ~90% of coins in cold storage. 
Now they offer 2FA on any send coins action. Which is really good if you have 2FA tied to your mobile device. And they also started keeping in upwards of ~96% of coins in cold storage. These things make it very difficult for your coins to get stolen.
Unless you do something to weaken your own security, such as have 2FA tied to email, google voice, etc. Or don't have 2FA turned on at all. Or have their API enabled. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:28:58
Great listen, just what I needed to hear.

Sorry, I was on mobile and didn't want to type everything out in the app. But I am at my desktop now, so....
Capital One called and before veifying that I am indeed the person they wanted to speak with, I asked to verify who they were. They said look at my caller ID - and the phone number they are calling from, should match to the phone number on the back of my bank card - which it did in fact match. They also did NOT ask me for my SSN or other fully identifiable information, but simply told me my card was being cancelled - and that they are calling me as a courtesy, to let me know, and why. I can go into the branch and have a new card issued or wait for one to come in the mail. There were no actions to be taken over the phone, but they simply told me what was happening and why. They also expressed no merchants have gone public but compared it to the severity of the Target hack a few months back.
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:42:40

@_date: 2014-02-26 01:26:37
1) correct, they lied and clearly did not have coins stored offline. 
2) Gox implemented a "fix" by reissuing funds over and over if they didn't go through the first time. They thought this would compensate for the issue, but clearly it didn't work, instead of fixing the tx-malleability issue from the start.

Not true IMO. It's possible he discarded everything about bitcoin, as he moved on, but happened to have his login still for this account. It's a very SUBTLE and anonymous, yet VERIFIABLE (via his previous posts on that account), that it's him.

I don't think blockchain.info has an API hook for tags, and a script like that wouldn't be simple, but anything is possible.
I think the Tags solution for now works best. Anyone can validate their own bitcoin address, and once it's done, you can't reverse or change it. This seems to solve the problem.
Let's say I want to shorten address 11111199999 to /me. And I tell people, donate to /me, and to verify that it's my btc address, it should say on there "David Shares." Anyone and everyone can then verify that the address is correct. If it doesn't say that on blockchain.info, then yeah, maybe it was switched and the users should know not to use it.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:37:42
Actually makes a lot of sense. Code pushes happen after hours on production in case something breaks. It could take a few hours to push all the code too and test. Prob with bitcoin is it's global, so there is no good "time" to push code.

yeah, in simple terms even with the most hash power, they could not mine all the coins because other pools and miners are all mining at the same time. so others are getting coins too, so it's spread out, and there is only so many coins every four years so it's staggered.

transaction technology, where a bitcoin-like technology could provide a basis for a new 
shared payments and transfer system using existing currencies and securities. **Such a 
system could reduce systemic costs, and provide faster, secure, transfers – particularly in 
the international arena.** However, given the **status quo and the lack of any clear 
incentive for developing such a network, we do not see banks developing this any time soon.**
This is a contradiction, or more realistically, a sign that banks are just fine making tons of money from their customers without any desire to make transactions faster and less costly. I bolded the two parts above that I find to be particularly upsetting.

yes it does. this means they won't be a returning customer, buying more phones in the future. it means that they wont be buying apps in the app store anymore, which means less income and users for apple. it means that the person will go to android, where the person will tell their family and friends to move over to. overall, this is not good for apple and if they continue to alienate themselves from the rest of the world, people will continue to move over until apple's platform is so unappealing that nobody will want to use it.

I don't blame Bitpay for this. Bitpay is showing how they can be a great conduit for nonprofits to accept bitcoins online, when they may not already have a web presence. Believe it or not, there is a big number of nonprofits still new to the web these days. 
Red Cross is a good primer for smaller NPO's to get on board. It's unfortunate that Red Cross chooses not publicize it though.

2FA is always a one-time use only. That's how it works. But it's based on triggers. So CB has a setting for each send (trigger), would require a new 2FA code. It's an optional setting, but one would be naive to not have this setting turned on.

prob because it's your first buy. but the price is locked. you should be okay as far as that goes but won't be able to buy until you receive your first bitcoin. coinbase should have given you a date of when it will 'arrive', it's usually pretty accurate too.

mBTC and other denominations are stupid. It's like saying, hey I have five pennies, doesn't it *appear* better? When in reality, your five pennies are just .05 cents of $1 whole dollar. One BTC is $X dollars. An mBTC is just a fraction of that. You're just kidding yourselves. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:24:06
Lol I say that cause of other things too. I bought in originally around $260, but only a little bit to "test" things out. Within two weeks prices were $600+. Then crashed to under $500 and I went to buy again but Coinbase put a hold on all buys! So I missed my chance then. Then recently I bought in again at $900 only for it to drop to $800. Then again today when I bought at $800 to have it go down to $650! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:10:52
Just to echo what others are saying. If you're in the US, Coinbase is probably the way to go. Those sites to earn free btc by watching videos and stuff are sometimes scams, and almost all of the time, a wasted effort. You will get paid literally .01 cents for your time, and you have to accrue X amount of dollars before ever getting paid. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:43:57

to get verified with my bank account took about 3-4 days, but this was in late october. after that, doesn't matter on when the bitcoin comes, as the price is locked in at the price you bought it at.

Not sure what they can do if they were to find out, but for them to find out seems very far fetched. Bitcoin transactions aren't even done within their processing network. It's completely outside of it so they wouldn't know about it unless you told them.

So you made me think. If I was a master hacker, I could DDoS a couple major exchanges, wait for a big drop, buy buy buy, then let the price go back up and make a shit load of cash. Maybe virtual currency is susceptible to manipulation? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:12:03
I did at $920 but I really didn't think it would keep dropping. I started watching last night and it dropped to 1000, and stayed. So I figured that was it. So this morning when it hit the crapper I bought in thinking that was the lowest. Boy was I wrong. The lowest I saw it today was 825. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:05:16
I bought some more at $920 then it dropped mins later to $825. Sigh. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:59:15

You can try to extrapolate some talking points from here:  
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:50:46
I don't really understand what it is you are asking? 
If you are a nonprofit, and want to accept bitcoins, you would set it up like everyone else using bitcoins. There is no governance on bitcoins, as there is with FIAT. So there are no tax implications on accepting bitcoins. 
The problem on the NPO side is you cannot receipt donors for their charitable gifting of bitcoins, because again, it's not taxable. 
If you covert the bitcoins to FIAT, I'm not sure how that would play out. Maybe since you're an NPO, you wouldn't pay the same taxes as everyone else, because NPO's typically get 'free' money all the time. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:41:10

I think Google is so big, so many moving parts, they are just watching right now. They don't need to "compete" in currency. I think when Bitcoins become more widely adopted, Google will be one of the first major merchants to accept Bitcoin officially as a payment method on all their platforms.
With the actual payment system, I bet they will have some sort of method of accepting bitcoins, that will be proprietary to Google. Maybe a Google App, or something, where paying with bitcoins will be made easy. But not creating an actual competing currency. There is too much liability. That is one reason why bitcoins are so great. Nobody wants to take on a true fiat competitor.

Check out the interview Coinbase CEO did with Kevin Rose. It's worth watching, and gives good details on how they operate  
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:31:44
Hello, can you provide reddit with more details? You say that you support environmental and public health causes. Can you list out what nonprofits you support? How much of the donation is sent to the nonprofit -100%?

It doesn't mean people aren't still buying them. Inflation may continue for another 6 months until the market finally responds to the lessening of the demand.

@_date: 2013-12-26 00:47:30
More info  
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:24:26
That would require a universal website that handles all transactions, in other words, a centralized network. All web owners or bloggers need to do instead is hyperlink to their webpage with bitcoin info.

Nice job, well done!

The govt only gets involved when you covert BTC to USD. then you'll have to account for that money. It's not payroll, so not sure how it's taxed. But if withdraw and deposit in small amount, it never be an issue?

Settle around ~800 and by Wednesday or Thurs back up to 1000. A lot are going to try to buy in the next 24 hrs which will get the prices to normalize again   
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:39:48
Obviously nobody knows for sure, but 2014 should be very interesting for Bitcoin. And if successful, maybe in 2015 wide adoption will begin to take place.

I don't know for sure, but he either makes them himself (I doubt it) or uses a custom minting company to create them. He submits the design to them, and they mint them. For example, you can order custom coins here: 
You can read more information on his site, about how he then adds holograms to the coins, again, done by third-party manufacturer.

Why would the NSA want deals with other countries? This would be a huge advantage over other countries. The U.S. could have unprecedented access to other country's digital currencies.

Register with Coinbase and they provide donation script codes to place on your website to accept Bitcoins right to your account. It's very easy. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:31:24
Gizmodo is king of hyperbole. The reality is, that "Bitcoin" itself is secure, but how people manage their bitcoins, secure it, and keep it safe, will always be an issue. Just like a regular U.S. bank, as much security guards and armored trucks there are, someone is going to steal some of that money once in a while. It doesn't make the money itself vulnerable. Just the management of it. Bitcoin just doesn't have any FDIC insurance.

Haha oh great the NSA is taking over bitcoin!! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:22:33
It's not a news site. It's a price ticker site, with mobile app. Apparently Blockchain is more interested in the mobile piece of it. I'm actually a bit surprised as ZeroBlock doesn't really do much different than other btc price sites. They even use Clark Moody charts. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:56:37
There's still time. The market is recovering very slowly!

and now it's down to $775!!! my god, my luck is horrible!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-25 23:04:09
This is actually an ingenious way to get nonprofits into bitcoins! 
This would force them to look into what it is, how much they got, and if it's worth it to them, accept the bitcoin and create a wallet, etc. 
A simple paper wallet could be dropped into the US Mail, sent to nonprofits all over, hand delivered, or even emailed to them. But I think since a lot of nonprofits are old school, mail would work best (and looks more legit). 
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:01:25
Congrats. I thought the announcement would be a bit more exciting than acquiring a mobile app, but hey, it's something. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:06:36
I just bought some more. It's a good time to buy. Prices may actually go down more next week (but I didn't want to miss out now) but will rebound and go back up probably higher later in the month.

Valid point about listing exchanges. I'll try to add it. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:24:21
All you need is a bitcoin address to have other people send bitcoins too. You don't need a web address or anything. If you're friends want to donate in bitcoin, they need bitcoin too. Then one person send bitcoins from their bitcoin address to his. He should open an online wallet to monitor it, such as Blockchain.info or Coinbase.com 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:32:00

Unless you've gone through the entire bitcoin code base, your at least putting partial trust into an unknown entity trusting that their code was written for the greater good, and not with any malice at all. Your also trusting all the bitcoin core developers.

Competition is healthy. Where are all the Silicon Valley startups when you need them? Something useful for a change would be nice. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:52:48
No problem
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:32:56
People can start mining at anytime. The problem is that there are more and more miners as time passes, creating lots of competition. Also, the mathematical problems to 'mine' bitcoins are getting more and more complex. Both create a difficult environment to mine bitcoins. But those that know how, are doing it. And lots of miners are pooling together to share resources and info. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:17:47
Everyone trying to buy in now due to the low cost will offset the current drop. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:59:07
Obviously he never checked into how much mining is costing with ASICS. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:53:26
Just follow the sources till you can't find anymore. I don't see anything wrong with citing a news site as long as the news report itself holds weight and is credible in of itself. Rumor mill is where they lose credit.

@_date: 2013-12-25 04:24:46
Nobody on this sub reddit knows the future of bitcoin, and playing the market is always speculative, and should always be taken as someone's personal opinion, to their life, and their situation. You should never take others opinion as the defining reason for you to buy or sell. Do your research, and plan accordingly.

I read the description but couldn't tell. Does the app alarm if you set it to a certain value? That is actually a feature I would want. So if I set to to alarm when it hits $900, can I do that? I don't have android so can't download it (iOS user).

Also, there only a set number of bitcoins available at this time. So they can only buy so much (what is available). BTC is staggered, meaning, only so many are made every four years. This would make it very difficult to buy out the majority, since it would take so long to do. Then bitcoins eventually cap out at 21m bitcoins, total.

So the question is, does Bitcoin use the Dual Elliptic Curve to generate public and private key pairs? Apparently the docs that Snowden leaked say the NSA created this flawed code so they can use it as a 'backdoor'. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:14:03
This is actually a valid concern. I was also worried that the OP was posting opinion, not fact, and posted no sources to his opinion.
I did some googling, and found this nugget which solidifies the concern; read for yourself:  
"There appears to be vendors that had validated Dual EC DRBG whose technology may have been built into Apple products." 
"OEM vendor for Apple mobile devices distributed with an ARM A8 core and iOS 5.0. They validated their cryptographic communications module which included dual EC DRBG."

Then make a universal website with images for media to use for bitcoins. I'm a blogger and also use images with coins. Until more non-coin images flood the market, you're going to have to deal with it.

So you had MOBILE PHONE-2FA on? So they intercepted the text auth code? 
If so, maybe this is a security weakness with mobile operators? I know for example with Sprint, you can send and receive text messages through the website (I haven't tried in a couple years tho). Maybe they are using a hack that way to intercept?

@_date: 2013-12-26 23:36:25
Go to coinbase.com, register with the email that belongs to someone at the school who is responsible for finance. Set up two factor authorization (2FA). 2FA ties a mobile phone number to the acct for extra security. 
After registering, go to your account and setup a widget page to accept donations.

Coinbase is good, even though they catch a lot of flack for poor Cust service response times. But that happens with any startup with exponential growth and constantly playing catch up to the extremely high demand. Their business model is solid and works.

Thanks for the honesty. That is certainly logical, but I would think that would be based on the premise of making money off of it, as the motive (which seems to be the problem that this thread started from). That's not the driver here. It's simply a place to discuss bitcoin, learn, and communicate.

@_date: 2013-12-04 15:58:48
The government will never be able to regulate Bitcoin the protocol, but they can impose regulations on exchanges (such as in the U.S.), for operating in the U.S. So for example, exchanges like Coinbase could possibly see some sort of regulation, such as what you describe, so if the govt really wanted to - they could tax the exchange - and the exchange would be forced to raise transaction fees exorbitantly to offset those costs.

There's certainly something to be wary of with this. Absolutely no reference to the actual email. Even a picture like you said, would add just a bit of credibility to it (even though anyone could actually write up, then take a pic). Anything really extra to add some credence would help.
Edit: And statements like this makes me feel as though this isn't a legit email from the Rothschild official "treasury team," which the excerpt is "But there is a (fairly) *new kid on the block*, the Bitcoin, and London wants a *slice of that business*."
Emphasis mine.

The survey is sucky but doesn't change the fact that mBTC and other denominations are stupid in terms of overall value. It's like saying, hey I have five pennies, doesn't it *appear* better? When in reality, your five pennies are just .05 cents of $1 whole dollar. One BTC is $X dollars. An mBTC is just a fraction of that. You're just kidding yourselves.

Casascius coins hold no value unless there is a bitcoin key on it with btc, and that can only be verified on the web. Don't think calling your bro in another country will fly, or always be a viable option. In Egypt they also shut down the phone lines too during Arab Spring.

Imagine two big exchanges like mtgox and bitstamp going offline for a day or two for no reason... I'm pretty sure the market would react with a price drop. It may just not be enough for the trouble though.

Good question. I sometimes wonder the same. It's all personal preference. How much are you willing to lose if your wallet gets hacked or lost? Spreading across wallets isn't a terrible idea, but prone to mistakes (losing passwords, etc).

Agreed. They've shown their colors on this one. If Bitcoin ever becomes mainstream, they'll just create their own Apple wallet and be done with it. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:15:51
Facebook already has FB credits. It's pretty much a failure. Apple coins is only a segmented market (Apple users only). Bitcoin is worldwide. 
IMO Google is the only one that has the potential to disrupt the space. But for some reason, I think the "no evil" slogan that google tries to do might actually happen. Google knows the importance of bitcoins success, and for them to try to undermine it with their own coin could potentially ruin the whole movement. I think what will happen is in the bear future, Google will start accepting Bitcoins with their own proprietary products (Google wallets, etc).

Fascinating. Maybe Satoshi is the NSA?
In all seriousness. Who else has the ability to disappear such as Satoshi has? Who else would know to not use secp256r1? And what does that mean - that the NSA could potentially be trying to build a digital currency that they know they will always have backdoor access to?
Sounds a bit paranoid, but anything is possible after the Snowden revelations.

If I'm not mistaken, they take the top exchanges (Mtgox, Bitstamp, and others) and average out the price, throwing out the high and low. Their price is updated every 10 seconds according to their API.

Please post an update after talking to the police. Since these people were arrested, it should be fairly easy for police to piece  together who they are and how they got your bank info. I doubt they are connected to coinbase, but you never know. 
My thought is coinbase has been very successful so far. Why destroy a successful business, that will be even more successful as bitcoin explodes, to ruin it all to scam a few thousand bucks from some people here and there. They are a million dollar company. 
Edit: one last comment. Please report this to coinbase. They need to know. Even if it's not them, they can at least verify on their end there is no security breach.

Tbh we don't need Visa/MC adoption. The whole point of btc is to bypass it. If I'm a merchant, all I need is a bitcoin address to receive money at.
