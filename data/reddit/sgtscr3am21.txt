I just don't see Bitcoin being able to topple the top countries currencies because those governments make so much money off being able to make their own currency. So I don't think the value will every reach the point of ~200k per coin , unless it stays relevant for 25 more years. I just don't think the government's will ever let it reach it's full potential. Like I said I hope it happens but we have to remember they have a lot more control than just what we know about.
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:47:29
That's true I wasnt thinking about foreclosures and the such.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:13:03
Depends on the day. They can also buy crypto and it rise over 100% in one day. Like all stocks and bonds you cannot buy the highs and still expect it to rise.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:33:34
I'm not referring to mainstream stocks, I'm referring to any investment option. Bitcoin is volatile but so is every investment, yes there are some extremely low risk ones but I'm sure there's a "stable" shit coin out there too lol.. No but the like 0.01% actually know when a federal currency is going to just go flat and be worth nothing. It could happen over night. Yes there are safer bets than Bitcoin but we weren't talking about that lol.
@_date: 2019-11-01 19:15:45
They must have found a sure shot way to track
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:04:50
Currencies do fluctuate though. The dollar itself may not "lose" value in the states but it does lose value. So is the dollar a stock? Is it's value propped up by how much it's cooperation makes? *Cough* Federal reserve printing money lol.
Bitcoin is risky, I agree. But a government currency is no less risky, especially when they can control it. It's not really your money at that point. They just allow you to spend it if you're in their good graces. I'm not saying throw all your money into btc, honestly if I was a German facing this I'd just roll my accounts over to somewhere else that doesn't have the negative rates.
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:32:36
That would be an exciting day and I'm hoping for it!
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:49:29
Yeah I'm talking about some shitty little house, I should've specified lmao
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:52:39
Good detail but Bitcoin given or bought can easily be moved to a few different addresses to make it more anonymous.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:08:21
How so? Who's to say I didn't buy $500 worth of btc on an exchange send it to my own wallet then sent it to "someone else's" and then they bought goods from the darkweb. Unless you flat out admit it was you, they cant prove who controls those wallets. Specially if you use a new wallet every transaction, right? I mean you seem to have a better understanding so maybe you can correct me and help educate me. I do appreciate it
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:12:49
I personally don't think 1 btc will ever be worth enough for a house but time will tell. And I have hopes it will, they are just slight hopes
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:04:04
100% agree. The only reason I own more federal notes than btc is to avoid the downward swings. So I can HODL my btc without worry lol but I also gut punch myself when I see the huge up swings. Comparing the two I can accept the latter more than not eating lol.

I agree it wasn't designed to be anonymous but it can be if used properly. In that instance a LEO can't make you take a drug test. I get what you're saying but what I'm saying is it allows for plausible deniability if used properly. Just because I buy Bitcoin on an exchange and send it to a wallet and it gets sent to another wallet, I can't be held liable for it because they cant prove I controlled those unused wallets unless they crack the device with the wallets lol
@_date: 2018-10-07 12:57:56
Kraken ftw
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:10:15
I kind of see what you're saying but if I was to send $370 from wallet A and $130 from wallet B to one address to complete a darknet transaction they can only link those 2 wallets to that transaction. If I never use either wallet again I don't see how they could track that because both wallets are unknowns. It doesn't matter if wallet A sends $600 to wallet B and then $500 from wallet B then the other $100 to wallet C. You still don't know the owner of those wallets. It could be 3, 2, 1 owners or is there something else I'm missing. Obviously you've got to have your OPSEC on point a d take the appropriate precautions when creating the wallets or this is null and void. But barring that, I don't understand how they can track ownership of the wallet. Anymore than just a random wallet J.

Thanks for talking with me and educating me instead of just running over me or getting offended and pissy lol.

@_date: 2019-11-22 02:13:59
That's the rule of thumb with any investment. They are always gambles. There are much higher risks stocks than Bitcoin.

I've had problems with all major exchanges other than kraken that's why I like them plus fees are less than 1%
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:24:24
Yeah, I lost about 13 btc with Mt gox. I didn't use real info so I couldnt file a claim. Sucks to suck lol but we could be dead, so keep living while you can!

Expedia is a scammy site anyways. I've booked with them three times. 2 times I ended up still having to pay money when I got to the hotel and the third time I got the no reservation speech you've been given. Luckily I paid with my bank acct and was able to get my money back
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:25:05
Blockchain.info is garbage anyways, they stole almost $1k from me and never responded to support messages for almost a yr.
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:25:56
Because everything people say online is true... lol they don't have time for that kind of shit.
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:44:49
I didn't get wind of the issues and since it wasn't a KYC account I couldn't recover any of it from the lawsuit. I'd have about 20btc if I couldve lol. But I learned the valuable lesson of never leaving your coin in an exchange after that.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:56:51
@_date: 2019-10-02 12:01:33
Why not just accept Bitcoin? This sign will only confuse people more and slow down adoption as people the majority of people know a "Bitcoin" not a "lightning Bitcoin".
@_date: 2019-10-28 11:52:06
I still wish I could get my btc back from mtgox
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:52:12
My kraken fees yesterday were only $25. $20.09 to sell my btc and $5 to send to bank account. I'm not sure what other fees you are referring to.
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:53:53
No, it last night literally cost me a at $5 fee to send USD to my bank account from kraken platform.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:52:19
Everyone thinks it will fail because of what the media has fed them. You just have to educate.

I couldn't file a claim... I didn't use my real info. Sorry bud
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:22:01
Never use coinstar, they eat up your money for using it. It's the complete opposite of what Bitcoin stands for. Why pay to use your own money?
@_date: 2019-02-25 12:22:46
How much would you sell one for? 
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:10:35
Not necessarily true, if the company doesn't see the need to accept other currencies then they will never know that another currency could've provided more sales. People aren't mind readers and neither are websites.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:06:12
I am op lol. I was asking if my grammar was incorrect...
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:27:18
Shit with as much coin as coinbase have there's not even enough for the hodlers anymore lol
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:53:21
I saw that headline and just laughed out loud at the ignorance.
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:47:30
It stills defeats the purpose of paying large fees to be able to use your own money, regardless of what form they are in. Bitcoin is the future, but wanting bitcoin to perform like stocks is not.
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:59:45

That's only if you had a verified account, you could make and use accounts on mtgox without all the kyc verifying

Nice! My last purchase was only like $3 in charges.
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:48:16
It's not that people want to buy it at 30k it's that there's more exposure at 30k.....
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:41:06
So people buy up all the land then resell it at a profit?
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:25:01
This needs gold lol

Why does this not get reddit gold!?
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:12:52
This isn't for an arena sport.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:23:52
First they were saying it was over to get people to stop buying when it was low so they could stockpile, now they want you to buy it so they can make money...
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:13:18
So continuing to publicize bitcoin is junk? That makes a lot of sense. I still find people who don't know what bitcoin is or the purpose behind it. Hell my crypto payment for a piece of equipment was the first of the sport that anyone is aware of. The whole point is to spread awareness and to get as many users as possible not to keep it quiet... and again if someone has the funding they can be the first shop (online) to accept crypto and to hopefully start a trend to start having all the shops accepting crypto. Idk why you would want to dissuade anyone from using bitcoin regardless of why they are using it, that's counter productive.

cant use bitcoins on craigslist
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:50:59
thats fine , im not trying to rob anyone of 2 BTC lol i just want to make a purchse on SR with a trial account before i verify anything.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:52:43
btw thank you for your response
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:52:04
yeah , im interested in investing , i just have to wait on mtgox to email me back and explain why i now can't verify my account due to this "error:undefined" crap
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:52:34
btw thank you for your response
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:59:04
Pure silver? I may buy one for my fire helmet if you sell cards separately and can customize.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:09:51
yeah thats why i was trying to find some other people who have used bmr or atlantis succesffully or any of the other sites. also know some of those dealers have their own personal sites that they actually have products for thats less than what they are on SR and i was looking for some of those.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:08:28
its not anonymous , craigslist is based on face to face transactions...
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:52:55
i've heard atlantis isnt reliable , and its up and down right now due to an attack. you may have had a bad link , theres lots of hackers out there putting up fake sites to get peoples info
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:36:37
I found prices to be a bit cheaper on BMR but im still going to try out SR
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:08:55
It wont allow me to transfer or withdraw any funds without verifying , im just going to verify its not a big deal. what happens to kids under 18 who make an account on mtgox use there money? they dont have proof of residency and theres nothing making u verify your age before u can sign up and put money into it?
@_date: 2013-04-30 00:47:53
not everyone uses bitcoins and craigslist isnt anonymous  thanks for trolling
