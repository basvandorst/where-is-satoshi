That's just one person discussing it.  It IS being coded--asshat.  You know the same 5 guys, you being one, are posting in here over and over about Segwit.  Ok, let's get some segwit going.  I can't wait.  Then after that craps out in 2 months the guys paying you are going to have to put up or admit they are frauds.

Lots of things can be done.  Sharding isn't even discussed here and that's a HUGE tell.  It's disgusting really.  If Lightning works and bitcoin scales, you will STILL have to shard if you want to keep block sizes remotely small.

Sorry...don't have time to discuss.  Segwit is a distraction at best.  Hope it goes through so folks like you will hopefully push against Blockstream 2 months after it's implemented when transactions are stuck again.   Just remember when that happens who you should be angry at.  Don't let them off the hook the next time.  There will be no more excuses.

It's multi-level marketing combined with a cryptocurrency and a trading bot--possibly.  If they are being honest then it could be interesting.  
If you invest, just invest a little and see what happens.  
Trading bots are definitely making a lot of money trading bitcoin.  If they were to take their profits and hire the best programmers for their trading bots then that could work.  
It's interesting.  No one here should call anything a scam as bitcoin was called that for years.  The problem with bitconnect is if you're not just trading the token and are instead loaning money, they could run off with it.  If they are honest though that would be kinda cool. 
Edit: 
This was 4 months ago and they are still going strong so...who knows, maybe they are being honest.

Dude...damn...you're not going to convince me.  Jesus.  You'll see...HOPEFULLY.  I'm on your side.  Go Segwit Go.  Let it happen already so we can get back to creating a scaling solution.  
You can't scale with a bit more block size and Lightning won't do a damn thing.  Ordinary users will NEVER use Lightning.   
Anyhow, I'm done with this conversation.  We're on the same side.  Go Segwit go.  I'm dead serious.  If Segwit isn't passed by Aug. 1st I'll be pissed.
