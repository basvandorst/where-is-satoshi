Thanks for reminding about the emails..  I have a few but need to try to recover the rest..  that should be good enough.
Yep - too many exchanges that are dead to even think about being correct but it has to be better to start your own story with an amendment than to let them have a blank canvas

at least you have your coinbase history or are you locked out?   I'm locked out and they are giving me the template reply runaround. (we're working on it.. etc)  
  You need to get a CPA and send in amendments of whatever you can.  Even if you do all the grunt work and have them bless it at the end.

Who knows what kind of witch hunt they are cooking..  The court definitely told them to stand down for most of their hunt (accusing everyone of money laundering) and just told them to take enough info so they can compare with your taxes to see if you didn't report similar stuff..  so with so many people not reporting but there wasn't any guidance for 2013... i guess more effort for 2014 and 2015?   who knows

Even if you had only $5000 and bought and sold back and forth you will look like a huge baller..  that's because Coinbase wasn't an exchange..  every buy and sell went to your bank account.  So you Can be doing a batch of buys and then sells and back and forth and boom looks like you bought 50,000 and sold even more if you made money yet you never had more than 10k in your accounts!!  This is a joke since I mined coins too so cost basis..etc..  what the hell..  lawyer time or just shoot off some amendments and IOUs??
