"Bitcoin is selling far higher above "spot price" than gold, silver, etc."
what are you talking about. gold, silver, etc miners are not idiots. their prices remain stable or go up with time. they don't dump product instantly or on loss like bitcoin idiots (want to get rich fast) miners who just dump as soon as mined. whats hurting the price are idiots who don't believe in technology (bitcoin) but wants to get rich fast. buying bunch of miners and flooding the market with excessive supply.

all because of the miners who don't value coin and dump it unlike gold and silver miners. if the creator value his/her product everyone else will too

this worries me. so many bitcoins owned by single human. this guy can be the most rich and powerful guy in future considering bitcoins are limited.

i find android mobile wallet and multibit desktop wallet to be the best apps for using bitcoins with easy. also on mobile wallet now you have the ability to sweep paper wallets by scanning qr codes plus it also tells balance in huge number of fiat currencies. very convenient and very easy

bitmain keeps pumping and dumping batches of S3 and now S4 2th/s miner is on the way. mining, like altcoins is not going to be profitable anymore very soon.
