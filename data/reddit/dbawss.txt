I live on a ranted appartment with my wife and 2yo daughter... the last one mess around everything on a daily basis since our appartment is quite small =/
It's a though call.

the only place I've stored the seed and password for the encryption is on my EverNote account software, installed on my PC, altough I'm not sure if it stores files locally or not... I have the backed up version of the Wallet on my PC, but the password isnt written into any txt/doc file.

well, that's a bummer... but I still can't believe it accessed the data from my EverNote without touching MyEtherWallet's private key (which had 18 BTC worth inside) right beneath Eletrum's seed nor my PayPal account.
There must be another way and I'm serious about not storing that seed any where else on my PC or any pendrives...

Just checked access logs (didn't know they had them!)
Nobody but me accessed my EverNote account since October.

I thought they could steal my Electrum's password info through hacking the software, but if you're sure about the bug not working on password protected wallets, then I have no other assumption to make other than:
They read my EverNote's note when I had it open, stole the seed (and probably MyEtherWallet as well), checked MEW and found nothing, because they didn't click on every single Token to LOAD, because my other Bitcoins were inside an unloaded sum of Tokens from a coin which just released.
That's really all I can think. They also didn't bother PayPal cuz it's FIAT and the hole is way deeper.
Can you think of something else given all the info I've provided? I ain't no computer savvy, but I know "the basics".

From what I know, there's no such thing as 2FAs for EverNote, but it's protected by a long password... Still, no other infos/accounts/wallets were stolen and it's been several days.
My bad, there is a 2FA, I'm setting that up! Still, I can't really relate.

It looks like a website because typically websites manage to have the first 3 or 4 letters (always capitals) for their own addresses, right after a number 3... like BitMEx which is 3BMEX.
About the hack:
I was traveling, PC shut down, haven't accessed my Electrum wallet for about 2 weeks previous the hack. When I came back home, on Sunday, I read about security issues and went to update my wallet, but the balance was already at 0.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:21:46
Yes, that's why I'm saying this could've indeed happened at any given moment I had my wallet open... Altough I don't recall visiting shady websites. But who knows...
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:42:54
When the hacker actually stole them on the 31st, yes my PC was offline.
I have different passwords: Electrum's is unique and very long, email is gmail 2FA protected and different from EverNote's password.

Not really, they could've steal my data and used whenever they want.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:52:08
you made a point and I shall fix this... however, that's the same as saying that Google steals your data from inside your Google Drive to access your good, or OneDrive or DropBox or any other cloud storage service. Of course I'm trusting their end, but it's odd the others were not stolen or even accessed.

Sure thing, thanks for the heads up and spending the little spare time you probably have (I know because family eats up a lot, in a good way, but still) to help me out.
Yeah, I still hold a fair chunk of cryptos and I'm surely not using those addresses again. I live in Brazil, so it's not THAT simple to acquire a Hardwallet but I'm definetly going to find a way to acquire one ASAP.
It's been 6 months now since I live off from Crypto profits, this became my full time job, but it always sucks being stolen... any amount. At least I learned not to place everything on the same basket.
I would sleep better if I knew for sure what actually happen, but I guess I'll never know... nonetheless, I will greatly boost my security the best ways I can, specially since they keep increasing it's price monthly, which is beautiful, but 6 months ago I had 1/10 worth of cryptos... Shit got serious now!
I wish you the best of luck on your journey as well and thanks again!

I know that, I'm not trying to recover. I'm worried about identifying the issue and (if possible) the person/website.
1) They (hackers) could've accessed my Electrum data any time I had it running and simply process the withdrawal whenever they wish.
So I can't really discard the Electrum issue since there's plenty of other infos on my computer such as 2FA backups... also plenty of other passwords on the very same EverNote note.
So it's VERY clear that the ONLY info leaked was my Electrum data, and it's been 12 days now since the actual steal.
Another relevant aspect: even if they had the Seed or the actual wallet.dat they can't access it without my password, since it was encrypted and there is NO such thing on my EverNote note such as: "Electrum Password: xxxxxx".
So here are the facts:
1) I was offline by the time it was stolen.
2) No place on earth has my Electrum password.
3) I don't have viruses/malwares.
So I'm back to the same conclusion: it was Electrum's security issue.

damn... ok I wasn't aware of that so it was possibly forged.
