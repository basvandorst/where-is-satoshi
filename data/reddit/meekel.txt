Comparing start up companies to exchanges is a scary comparison. 
Many start ups wouldn't see the type of growth that many Bitcoin exchanges would be seeing due to the increased media attention across this year and the increasing Bitcoin price.

Once again, as it seems happens a lot with the Bitcoin community, assumptions are being made.
MtGox signed the contract. Let's get this fact straight. Their lawyers would have looked over the contract and if there was anything "clauses hidden in small letters", that's up to MtGox and their lawyers to discover.
If you had signed a contract and the other party then didn't fulfill their side of it, of course you would go after them. Otherwise what's the point of a contract?
At the end of the day, MtGox had an obligation to fulfill the contract and by the looks of it, they didn't do that.
CoinLab do give a damn about the community. But without their business, they can't support the community.

Of course they can, but comparing a generic start-up that may be dealing with little to no money to an exchange isn't one that should be made lightly.
You can compare two generic entities (startups in this case), but you have to look at the big picture in regards to money flow, unique visitors and rapid growth for example.
I wouldn't say Bitcoin exchanges are your "regular" start up company.
