It's all talk, smoke screen and mirrors, they laugh at us. We purchase VPN thinking we have privacy , but the CIA and other government s have tools to sneak in and thieve your VPN data. One of Edward Snowden s docs shows VPN is worthless. Also, one if my friends works in software at a bank and he said banks can go back two or three steps and get your original IP and location. Private internet access knows this, but they can't tell you.  And I looked up the address for private internet access, it's a PO Box in the USA....same as MY address but a different box. It's a shell company and a good chance it's the CIA...stunning ehh
The CIA actually sets up bogus companies to attract bad guys into thinking they are safe then decrypt the data and laugh. Viber was a joint operation if the Israeli secret service and CIA to thieve your contacts and build a global contact list thieving people's contact lists from phones. Don't believe me, Google it.
So why  do these politicians want VPN deleted, they are just lazy. If they can come thru your front door without asking for a key then why not. They make the rules, we are just cannon fodder to be abused in the name of corporate profits earned by thieving all your personal data.
You or we all need to understand this is a game. The CIA or NSA has EVERYTHING stored in Utah . Everything in the pipe is downloaded and stored. They have it all folks....wake up.V PN is a joke...it's keeps honest people out, but the real thieves have access including the FBI and CIA.
