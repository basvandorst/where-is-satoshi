Yes. I personally dont do cold storage because it does not resolve the security issue of robbery or fire - in addition, in case of an event in which I need to liquidate my coins immediately, I would need to have the files on hand. Furthermore, your password is probably not as secure (if it is something you need to memorize (or is typically used in other application services) - otherwise if you want the password to be the highest grade security - you would need to store the password somewhere (on a file, etc).
Here is my method, and my personal recommendations to how people should store their wallets.
1) First whatever wallet you have (assuming just the public and private key) encrypt it using .zip file with AES-256 security. Make sure that whatever password you use is equivalent in difficulty as the private key of your wallet. Example Password: (63Ne92%3nc!39f This would effectively be uncrackable via brute force (meaning no one can guess your password). So in order to get to your wallet, someone needs that password. Now obviously put that wallet file into Dropbox (which allows a 30 day backup). Why do that? For one, since the file is encrypted, no one at Dropbox or anyone for that matter (even if they intercept and found the file) will be able to crack into that file. Whats more impressive is that now you can access the file anywhere any place on the planet. Whats even better is that dropbox has a 30 day backup, so for whatever reason you lost the file, you can still retrieve it without stress.
But there is still one problem. There is no way in hell you are going to remember the password you use to encrypt the file (this crazy password: 63Ne92%3nc!39f So where are you going to store this password? On Dropbox? No. I recommend storing it in Google Drive. Something on the cloud. Here is the beauty of this method. If someone hacks (say a worker at Google - even though the file is by google =&gt; highly improbable) into your Google Drive, and came across this string of letters, they would not know what the string of letters reference to (Obviously dont name the file "Litecoin Password Wallet.txt" that would just give it away). That means in order to successfully hack you, they would need to hack both Google and Dropbox. That in and of itself is magnificently difficult. So to reiterate you have your wallet password on Google Drive and the actual wallet on Dropbox. No one on the planet know the correlation except you. Both of which is on a cloud, which implies you can access your wallet anywhere on the planet with the maximum possible security imaginable.
But I can do you one EVEN better. Enable Two Factor Authentication on Google and Dropbox. So in order to even try to hack into your Dropbox AND Google, they need to have your phone. Which compounds the difficulty even more.
So to reiterate, this is what it would take for the hacker to get and steal your wallet - in the easiest way possible. They would have to steal your phone, guess your phone passcode or fingerprint scanner. Assuming the dropbox app and google drive app is on your phone already; extract the files and send it to their computer. Then sift through all your files and MAKE THE CORRELATION between your password on google and dropbox.
This leaves only one possible way someone can hack - is if you told them exactly how to hack you. I assume you are smart. Dont tell someone how to hack you.
Most common way someone will try to hack you:
1.) Someone tries to access your Dropbox account across the internet. Found out your password. Two factor authentication. They dont have your phone. Hacker loses.
2.) Someone tries to access your Google account across the internet. Found out your password. Google internal flagging algorithm activates. Hacker loses. If they get through that, two factor authentication. They need your phone. Hacker still loses.
3.) Your Dropbox account is open in a public place like a library. Hacker walks by and downloads all your files. Hacker finds your encrypted litecoin wallet. Hacker tries many different password combinations. Unable to hack due to the sheer difficulty of your password. (It will take them many lifetimes of the universe to guess your password). Hacker will eventually give up as no one in their right mind will spend their entire life trying to guess an impossible password. Hacker loses.
4.) Your Google Drive account is open in a public place like a library. Hacker walks by and downloads all your files. Hacker finds your weird string. Doesnt know what it is or what it is for. Scans through the other files and ignores that one. Hacker doesnt even have your encrypted files (since it is on Dropbox). Hacker loses.
5.) Your house catches on fire. Your computer burns up. File is still on the cloud. Retrieve it anywhere. Hacker loses.
6.) You accidentally deleted all your files from Dropbox or Google Drive. Retrieve the file from the 30-Day trash. Hacker loses.
Is your method bad? By all security measure comparisons that everyone else is using, no. Does it have some downsides? Yes. If you are okay with those downsides, then go all for it.
The ultimate impenetrable way of storing your wallet - unless you are massively stupid and tell everyone (like me). But you know I thought of this, so obviously I have an even higher security overkill - come at me. Anyways, you are welcome. :) cheers.

I would only recommend that if you are accessing your wallet frequently. What happens if you forget your password? That'd be the worst. If your answer is to store the password somewhere in case you forget, then there is no need to memorize it at all and might as well make it as unbearable difficult as possible. You'd only be copy and pasting it anyways. Since most peoples current method with crypto right now is buy and hold, then the need to access to wallet is infrequent, thereby not needing to memorize another password among the sea of password you already have to memorize for other applications.
But that is just my personal opinion. If you feel as if Diceware is safe enough for you, then by all means go for it.

If someone has control over your Dropbox it is irrelevant. Your bitcoin wallet is encrypted so either way it is still safe.
