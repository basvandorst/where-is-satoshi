The people getting murdered, tortured and kidnapped are a direct result of the war on drugs.  Fear of government reciprocity turned something that would happen freely into an enterprise undertaken only by the most ruthless who care little about government recourse.

So you don't like people with blue eyes.
A group of stodgy old fucks get together and scrawl some shit on paper saying that it is illegal to have blue eyes.
No one is harmed by having blue eyes, but you find it to be the most disgusting property for a person to have, therefore, all people with blue eyes must be jailed.
This is how I see your argument.  
Who could possibly be harmed in a free exchange?  And please don't tell me about the people who OD'ed on some of the drugs because you can just as easily kill yourself quickly with booze or a little slower with shit food like McDonalds (but the gov doesn't give a fuck about that).

Bit-Card ships these cards quickly and I receive them in about a week when they ship.  I haven't heard of any state based services, but, if someone is thinking of starting one, my only gripe with the Bitcard is that the private key seal on the front tends to stick when attempting to peel it off.

This is a useless approach.  Slavery is the best case in point.  It is absolutely immoral for one human to own another, yet the law had stated it was legal.  Your recommended recourse to slaves would have been to work within the system?  Ludicrous.

Right and wrong (morals) are absolute.  When a classless act happens to a person (like lying), some people are quick to say, "That was immoral."  They are simply wrongly classifying a tasteless act for immorality.  It's important to make the distinction because government (the people who use force) overstep morality on a constant basis.

Small scale, but to give some perspective on Mastercard.
Mastercard asked me to fly into Purchase, NY to interview (on my dime) in early October 2015 (software dev position).
They made me an offer and started the process of on boarding immediately.
I joined in late October.
First day on the job, they loved me, almost finished the entire project.
2nd day, I go out to lunch.
After returning from lunch I attempt to park my car in the visitor parking lot.
I'm greeted with, "What are you here for?"
"I'm a contractor with MC" is my reply
"That's nice" is the response
(I realize the security guy is being a complete dick, so wait out the 2-3 seconds of complete silence for him to respond)
"So, what's your name?"
I respond with my name.
"You are not in the database"
As the security guy is saying this, I remember that I have the temporary badge in my jacket.  I pull it out and hold it to the camera for his viewing.
"I can't see it when you hold it that close", is his response to this action.
At this point, I've had it, I say, "Oh come on!" and pull the badge a few inches back to "put it in focus for him."
His response, "I'm not letting you in."
I respond, "Fine."
I back my rental car up, go back to the hotel and simply instruct my manager to ship my phone charger to my address.
I then receive phone calls from the head of Mastercard security, the department head, my manager and the recruiter, all of whom are apologetic for this aholes behavior.
I don't go back.
I don't need to.
I have plenty of crypto, but beyond that, respect.
Fuck mastercard.
I even wrote a script in NXT that committed some Fuck Mastercard emails to the blockchain in late October if you want to search for them.
To re-iterate.... FUCK MASTERCARD!

Fellow gambler here.
Miss the days of Tradesports/Intrade and their superb API... they died a painful death because of the credit card limitations congress put on all gambling websites around 2007/2008, with crypto-currency, there is no stopping it.
I'm so excited about the possibilities.
I have an automated betting bot running (just picking favorites at the moment, but that will change) along with a NXT asset that will automatically pay out profits to shareholders of this 'fund'.  With all the free to use API's available, we are looking at a time where Vegas will have to adapt/accept crypto to survive, plus the vig is essentially going to quickly approach zero with binary option sites like Tradesports re-emerging.

Art is not a necessity.  Food &amp; shelter are.

@_date: 2013-07-12 01:41:52
This sounds fantastic, except, there is no impetus to produce and you end up with less goods and higher demand.  Hyperinflation eventually sets in.  It's funny how all Utopian concepts involve the state, when humanity has had the exact opposite experience primarily because of the state.  Remove the controls that the state has imposed, e.g., min. wage, EPA, IRS, etc.., and you are closer to the ideal that is sought.

What if I had given starving children some Bitcoin paper?  What would I be then?  
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:43:43
I do at least 2-3 deals on [LocalBitcoins.com]( daily
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:07:17
Tradesports/Intrade was the best.  I had personally talked to John Delayney when he was alive and he provided me with zero fees and a bonus on positions picked up when I was making markets in horse racing.  If Bitcoin was around back then, none of the liquidity would have dropped, matter of fact, the reverse would have happened.  BetFair has a similar layout to Tradesports and a site that can replicate that with Bitcoin as the currency will do very well IMO.

I'm back to BitInstant, can't deal with Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:00:22
I'm used to them taking up to 3 days to payout, but it's over a week now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:38:54
No affiliations, however, Bitbook.biz, BTCSportsBet.eu and NitrogenSports.com are all great.  Haven't had a problem with BitcoinsSports.eu until this past month.
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:04:58
Sucks dude, totally feel your pain and it is definitely one of my biggest fears.
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:59:32
What would be wrong with leaving Russian Rubles?  The one bar I frequent daily has a currency exchange upstairs!  One of my clients is based in Canada and I told them they could pay me in Bitcoins or Canadian dollars if they wanted to (they chose to pay me in USD).  Now, 3 pounds of anything, that is an inconvenience, a piece of paper with implied value, not an inconvenience, especially since I offered them the option of receiving cash.
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:02:27
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:22:15
Great explanation.

I deposited cash on Thursday, still no funds appearing in BitFloor

Love Gyft, but eGifter offers Walmart gift cards purchased with Bitcoins.

What guarantee do you have of not being scammed.
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:59:07
My account is now showing as -8?  This is getting crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:33:52
Sweet, thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:36:03
This is probably the reason why we are seeing the run up in price.  MtGox users are forced to buy if they have a cash position, then transfer those Bitcoins to another exchange for withdrawal.
@_date: 2013-02-27 17:15:39
LOL - eat the paper!  Good one.

No.  You dial that from your cell and you reach me.  It's a service called star star me from Sprint.

This is a great point and reason why I don't accept the posts to the contrary that say the bartenders were being fake "cool" about it.  If I had said, "Listen man, I've got some monopoly money that suddenly seems to be gaining value on the net and I'm gonna tip you with it", they would have been like, "you know what dude, I'll take my tip in cash", which I offered.
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:43:06
Received.  Fantastic site man, I wish you the best of luck with it.
@_date: 2013-02-27 17:13:41
I did NOT keep a copy of the private keys.

I did receive a response today, thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:02:36
BitcoinsSports.eu has paid me, took a few days, but I've received it.  I will go right back to giving them my business again.
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:29:40
They were cool with it.  I cleared it with them before giving it to them.

I've been using LocalBitcoins.com since January and most people keep asking me "How are you making money?"  The short answer is, I'm not, but building a community of people I can trade Bitcoins with at a fair price is important to me for this very reason.

I fly about once a week and used to use Priceline exclusively, which is now changing.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:13:11
You guys are the **absolute** greatest!
Only *complaint* I have is that cards are not removed from your wallet when they have a zero balance.  It is also difficult to find out what the balance is on some of the cards.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:35:32
I've worked on many trading desks (albeit as a software developer), but would still concede you *may* have more experience in security analysis, simply because I do not look at charts to determine if I am going to invest in something or in the case of Bitcoin, use on a daily basis.
I'm not sure how you can jump to the conclusion that someone who will buy Bitcoin, regardless of price, and potentially use that purchase (which is usually denominated in another currency, like USD) as immature.  If I'm going to buy gold from AmagiMetals.com, which I do every few days and purchase Bitcoins to use at the AmagMetals.com site, it's being used a currency.
You have fully qualified your position as someone who feels Bitcoin is overpriced, so, why not short it, or develop a site that allows the shorting of Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-01-19 17:20:12
At least you didn't get drunk and give away all your BitCoins
@_date: 2013-02-27 07:06:19
This is what I used.
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:39:17
Thanks.  Just spoke with the Wash.io founder about Bitcoin, very excited that brick and mortar shops are starting to adopt it.
@_date: 2013-02-27 18:23:18
Just had a lengthy discussion with the bartender about some of the pockets of resistance on reddit.  This guy IS interested in bitcoin and today I tipped him $11 on a $9 bill, plus I gave him .1 bitcoin.  If this does not make you happy then your screen name kind of sums it up.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:20:52
I've been using [LocalBitcoins]( since December and now have a good network of people I can call on to buy &amp; sell from.  It's the best alternative when an exchange goes down, which is the direction all these exchanges are heading in at the hand of the US Gov.
@_date: 2013-02-25 11:27:57
This is my favorite idea yet.
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:22:12
I noticed CampBX.com takes money orders, not sure why more exchanges are not doing this.
@_date: 2013-02-27 18:12:52
Just got back from the bar and left the bartender Chris $20, $9 tab and $11 tip in cash.  I also left him .1 in bitcoin.  If this does not make anyone happy they can suck my dick.
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:44:16
One of the bartenders told me he plays a game on the net that uses BitCoin, so, he'll get immediate use out of it.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:31:07
I put an order in 10 days ago, no response from support
@_date: 2013-02-19 08:16:12
If a government cannot control it, they will attempt to destroy it, plain and simple.  This will have a positive effect on the price of BitCoins obviously.  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't see smooth sailing for anyone involved in BitCoin.
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:21:06
HA, good one
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:08:03
I use BitBook.biz all the time, excellent recommendation.
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:51:36
You'll need to tell me who "you guys" are, because I'm not one of them.  I love the concept of Bitcoin regardless of price.  I use Bitcoin in a purchase capacity almost everyday and do at least 2-3 deals per day using [LocalBitcoins.com](

I just sent my daughter a $50 Amazon gift card using Gyft, paid with Bitcoins, friggin amazing!

I used this machine at the Bitcoin Conference in San Jose, worked perfectly, definitely thinking about ordering one, just don't know where I could put it.
@_date: 2013-02-27 21:15:17
I know, it's amazing that all bartenders don't fit this mold of underclass that you seem to lop them into.  There are some bartenders out there who are actually interested in tech.... shocking.
As for today, to squash the idiotic banter of people like you, I tipped $11 on a $9 tab (USD) and then gave .1 BitCoin on top of that.  I know people like you will find something wrong with this, so, go at it.
@_date: 2013-03-04 07:43:55
Get into hotels &amp; rental cars and I'm in.
Great site.

There should be a double upvote button that can only be clicked with a corresponding Bitcoin payment.  This answer is one of those rare double/triple upvote moments

I've made two Gyft card purchases with Bitcoins since their inception.  All Bitcoin users should send a friend at least a $10 Gyft card to spread the Bitcoin love.

Here's to hoping that Roman and the good peeps at BitFloor inform the users of what went down.  My gut tells me the feds shut down the bank account for 'terrorist like' activities.

I'm not a huge buyer of gold, but it looks like the market is only about 4%, I'm not sure how that compares to other brokers though.

Apparently you've never used the **Invest** portion of the site.  There is a **cash out** button, similar to the **flag for help** button you see when you win a bet and they don't pay out in a timely manner.
@_date: 2013-04-24 07:16:51
It's funny that the OP equates a slow rise with sustainability.  As a holder of any asset you should want the quickest rise in price as fast as possible.
If you truly want sustainability in Bitcoin you will continue to hold and use Bitcoin regardless of price and encourage others to do so.

Wait.  You USE bitcoin and would not like it as a tip?
You've inspired me to do this again today.
@_date: 2013-02-09 06:10:59
Bubbles are only created through force.  What you are witnessing is true demand.  If demand falls, it will be reflected in the market price.  Remember, government is NOT influencing the price of BitCoin through barriers of entry or price manipulation (although,that's probably slightly untrue considering the devaluation of the dollar has in some part led to BitCoins rise)
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:09:28
The motivation is not for money, but definitely for the necessities that money buys, i.e., food &amp; shelter.  I'd love to see a system like the one recommended work, but the basic premise of acquiring goods, like food or shelter on the backs of others will never work IMO.
@_date: 2013-02-27 18:47:51

Binary options are great hedging tools against volatility.
Once more options are offered and for a greater price, the volatility should come down significantly.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:06:11
This chart *implies* that it cannot be invested in based on your expertise?  I don't view Bitcoin as a security, but as a mechanism to trade value (money).  No one is demanding you use Bitcoin, I'm not certain why you are getting so bent out of shape over it.  If I don't respond to your next rant, it's because I'm off doing a Bitcoin deal.
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:34:03
Please post a link to where I can buy a gold Casascius.
Would love one of those.
