lmao i dont even know how you managed to do that, it only spiked that high for such a brief amount of time. regardless, if you believe in the tech youre completely fine. $1000 is a lot of course, but in the long run, 2 working adults can stand to lose that and be completely fine. its well worth the risk for a high likelihood of reward. stay strong!

cringeworthy response dude. i mean im in your boat and am very suspect of coinbase (and have had many personal issues myself), but youre doing a terrible job of representing yourself as a knowledgeable investor in this space. this community is filled with a cacophony of emotional, baseless opinions. dont add to that noise. present facts in your response without making personal attacks, otherwise youre adding to the decline of this place.

Hi welcome to crypto world! Please never do that again. Dollar Cost Average :)

I probably would not have any idea of controversial statements were being delated, but on the whole my experience here has shown me there are people on both sides of the coin (major pun intended). I see really heated debates on here all the time discussion in-depth philosophies and options. Sometimes you see people who are acting like ignorant fools or getting really aggressive in their attacks against someone else, and yea that should be deleted... but that seems rare (to me, at least)
edit: keep in mind the sources of what youre reading. 99% of people come here, act civil, and leave with no problem. the 1% that comes, causes trouble and gets banned... they are the ones creating posts criticizing this place

Actually youre right because after having worked around the tech industry in San Francisco for a few years I should have known at first sight this guy wasn't messing around.

Dude looks like he hasnt gotten into a bed in 3 months. Straight coding binges.

I would be cautious of this strategy for a newbie to crytpo.

Well if I come back in a week and your comments gone, I'll know for sure haha. Honestly I just assume all moderators on reddit are shady, and furthermore reddit is the least mature platform out of all the ones I source for information so I do not come here expecting super meaningful information.

Umm I actually do not know! I dollar cost average or buy the dips, so never had to worry about automatic payments. Even googling it real quick doesnt offer me a clear answer, sorry bud
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:18:35
Agreed. Said with such seriousness, I cant even laugh.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:21:12
Dont be scared by this if youre new to trading, its actually quite easy :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:39:32
Someone else stated something similar, will edit my post here shortly...

No but, like everything else in this game, its about perceived value. A hardware wallet feels like physical security that is tangible, so our brain thinks its safer lol.

1. It is not good. GDAX is the backend of Coinbase and the only reason why people use Coinbase is because its a super simplified UI so anyone not familiar with trading will be able to purchase bitcoin. Coinbase feels like youre just purchasing something on Amazon or something.... GDAX is like a legit trading experience that can be overwhelming at first (but its actually super simple if you learn).
2. For storing, you have a few options, but its generally considered not good to have your money on an exchange. Research "Mt Gox"
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:21:48
I expect to stay up all night refreshing GDAX!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:36:58
**Listen up newbies: COINBASE AND GDAX ARE THE SAME COMPANY. Dont pay unnecessary fees for a prettier, more user-friendly UI. Learn how to use GDAX.** No fees. Also doesnt seem to be crashing as much as Coinbase (atleast for me).
**Edit: As some people have pointed out, Coinbase is good for buying a surprise dip that happens before you can get your fiat currency cleared into the exchange. If you dont already have money sitting in your exchange wallet on GDAX, you can purchase immediately using your bank or a credit card through Coinbase so you dont miss the price. GDAX does not allow this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:39:14
Yea I will edit to my original post because this is a crucial disadvantage for someone wanting to catch a dip w/o already having $USD cleared on the exchange.

youre going to switch 99% of your holdings to alts the day before

If I had seen Ethereum's creator before investing, I might have thought twice:
Now that I know more, I love &lt;3 crypto world.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:43:52
Ive read because the transaction cant physically process, that Coinbase (or whatever your exchange was) should be able to fix it, but customer service will take forever
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:55:00
im in the same boat :(
