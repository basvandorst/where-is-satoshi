Here's a small part of an IM conversation I had this evening with a Coinme/Coinstar support rep on their markup fees.  They're at least 11% above Coinbase ask and are stating 4% fees.  Pretty much BS answer to protect themselves. 
06:26 PM | Me: Question: Bitstamp’s asking price was about $10,165 at the time of I bought the bitcoin at the Coinstar machine, however, on the machine and voucher, it said the price was $10,759.75. Plus another 4%. All in, that’s another 6% on top. I’ve bought bitcoin with cash (and online) for 6+ years now as this doesnt make sense. Can you please explain this?
06:29 PM | Kathryn from Coinme: The prices displayed on the Coinstar kiosks are the price that Coinme sells Bitcoin at. This is the price that you are purchasing at when you deposit to a Coinstar machine. Once deposited in to the wallet, the value of Bitcoin in the wallet is pulled from various sources and is an aggregate average of the market, and may not reflect the price that Bitcoin was sold for at the Coinstar kiosk. Essentially, we mark up the price by about 4%
06:33 PM | Me: You DO know that the actual rate I bought bitcoin was an exchange rate of $11,209.19? If you take the # of coins I was given ($20 divided by 0.00178425). Can you please tell me which “various sources” are being used? It definitely cannot be Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, or even BitcoinAverage Index. You’re markup is closer to 11%
