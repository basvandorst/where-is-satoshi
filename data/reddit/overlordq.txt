What? Core's default mempool is 300MB. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:14:45
No, ~~it's set to 500MB,~~ the graph includes a segwit discount into the calculation.

That only tells you where it was relayed to blockchain.info from, not where it originated.

Because if they only care about profit, empty 1MB blocks are equal to empty 2MB blocks. So why add in another variable, considering 2MB blocks would allow more transactions in that could cause a conflicting transaction.

Because manipulating the EDA is only profitable while they're getting coins for it. Once we hit the long tail, the move to a fee market will make this pointless. Not to mention the more they do it, the quicker the halvening comes which makes it even less worthwhile.

Yes, but isn't this what people complain about banks? It's essentially not your money at that point if you're having to wait. It makes not all coins equal.

Your keys, phrase, etc are encrypted using a password only you know. This encrypted string is then sent to the server and stored.  
By utilizing proper methodology this content is near impossible to unlock without the users password.
Next time the user wants to use their coins, this encrypted content is shipped back to the user, and decrypted locally on their trusted local client.

Whatever backend they're using whether it's bitcoind, multibit, their own handrolled client, or so on, got disconnected from the network somehow.
Looking at their [blocks page]( shows that they've received two more blocks from the main chain, but since their connection to the bitcoin network is evidently still having issues, they're missing the blocks in-between.  So sending money to/from Coinbase backed wallets will likely be pretty spotty until they get this figured out.
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:45:17

@_date: 2013-04-10 15:12:29
Trade is the USD trade volume from the top exchanges., ie: BTC-E, MtGox, etc. 
Transaction is the approximate BTC transaction volumes.  
So if you compare the two you can approximate what volume of BTC transactions are done on the exchanges vs volume on 'normal' BTC spending on goods/services. 
If the ratio is high, that means there's lots of transactions but little activity on exchanges, so BTC is actually being utilized for things.
If it's low or unchanged, then the BTC transaction volume is being driven solely by the increase in volume on the exchanges.
While not the end-all indication of speculation vs utilization, taken with other factors it's another data point people can use to better know what the market is.
