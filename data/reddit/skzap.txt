Funny how people forget. This company was hacked and lost a nice sum of bitcoins less than 6 months ago. Oh but it's for apple users ? Nevermind

Private corporations will always have an incentive to make their thing look bigger than it actually is. If linux was owned by someone, they would make it look like they are the majority (android mobiles + servers should be enough).

I know nothing about quantum physics, but I've heard about [Grover's algorithm]( that could speed up a search algorithm by O(sqrt(n)) instead of O(n).
So in theory, wouldn't this reduce the difficulty of just 'looking up' in the available field of private keys, and doing it much faster, to search for addresses that have &gt;0 tokens in them?

How can people upvote this ?
This guy is either nazi or watched too many movies. The reasons why Bitcoin adoption is slow in France has nothing to do with the people.
Anytime any mainstream media talks about Bitcoin, they can't stop showing how easy it is to buy Drugs or Weapons with BTC.
99% of the population will believe and automagically associate Bitcoin with terrorism or whatever.

The price would rise, there is no way to tell how much that would cost.
Most likely too much for anyone on the planet, including me.
