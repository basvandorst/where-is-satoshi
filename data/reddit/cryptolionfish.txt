I used an old hard drive that was laying around and it works pretty great since about one and a half years... Just go for it, you can always upgrade later.

You can let someone write your advertisement in the sand and he makes shure it stays there for a month. Was walking past it today and had to let you guys know...

You could try a child pays for parent transaction, where you create a new transaction to one of your addresses with the inputs of the unconfirmed transaction and a relatively high fee. The theory behind it is that a miner that wants to get the high fee of the second transaction has to include the first one in the same block for it to be valid.
Andreas explains it better than me if you want to look that up. Good luck!
