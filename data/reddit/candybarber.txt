Bitcoin may not be managed by any central authority but that does not mean governments will not be able to stop it if they really want to. They could end 99% of the trade in cryptocurrency by simply deeming it illegal to have them in your possession. For sure a small group of people will still use them for illicit activities, but most of the market will be scared away from Bitcoin.
Sidenote: I am a big fan of Bitcoin and crypto in general, but one should not spread nonsense while trying to promote it.
If you are interested in legal discussions about Bitcoin, Crypto and blockchain in general, make sure to visit the new subReddit we created for that today! :)

That was exactly my point, thanks for making it more clear! People sometimes really overestimate the power of crypto and underestimate the power of governments..

Maybe mister Ver should read some self-help articles on how not to get stuck to his own opinions and how to stop slowly converting them from an opinion into a religion!

Well it would mean all the difference in the world in my opinion! Right now customers that pay with Bitcoin do it because they like it, not because it is the cheapest option to pay.
