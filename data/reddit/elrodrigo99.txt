If you have a lot, it is good to invest in a hardware wallet such as a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor. They cost about $100. If you don't have enough to warrant that kind of investment, you can download the Electrum desktop wallet for free and keep it on your computer.
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:36:08
In that case, why not pick one shitcoin and put the whole 45 on it and see what happens?
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:39:18
There is no reason to think the wallet was created there just because OP used it to to show the wallet's balance. And if it was auto-generated, how did they make sure the words were all in the WP?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:57:29
Wow, that's a hell of a lot of coin!
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:08:34
That would also explain why OP has consistently ignored questions about the number of seed words. If it's in the puzzle, they wouldn't answer such questions.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:22:02
no, because no one here has summoned them yet, which is odd as it's getting kind of late

After you put it into an Electrum wallet, you should get a hardware wallet such as a Trezor and transer it there. 25 BTC is way too much to keep in a desktop wallet like Electrum. It'd be better to put that in cold storage.

Accounts have to be verified, so I'm not sure they would allow an 11-year-old to set one up. He can follow the market on coinmarketcap.com. Why does he need a Coinbase account? What do you want him to do with it? Is he going to be trading?

"when the FBI  arrested Sharma, Trapani and Farkas, they also seized 91,000 Ether tokens"
I'm curious as to how exactly this was done
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:11:08
OP is using a different version of the WP. In that version, [7][2][5] is written as [2,5,7].
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:06:19
Oh OK, I thought it was a desktop wallet. How does it allow cold storage? Does it generate paper wallets?
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:34:24
Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:26:03
I'm curious as to whether these clues are just clues and not keys. If they are clues, it means the puzzle should be solvable without using them. A real clue should make solving it easier, not making solving it possible. Otherwise it would be a key rather than a clue. So if they are truly are just clues, they need to be treated as not vital.

It all depends on your picks really. Trading altcoins can be kind of a crapshoot. It order to steadily make a predictable profit every day, you would really need to be picking winners every day. For example, if you put in 1 BTC into an altcoin you're confident is going to go up 5% that day and you hit that mark and you have a limit sell order set so you can immediately get out, there's your $500 right there. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:45:48
Forgive my ignorance, but assuming you have the 24 seed words, do you need to know what kind of wallet its for (Trezor, Ledger, Electrum, etc.) or is there a way to access the wallet with the seed words without needing to know the wallet type?

I always thought that since an address is a hashed version of the public key, there is more than one possible address for a wallet, but all of them would be signed by the same private key, from which that public key was derived. Is that incorrect? If not, then how does changing the address change the private key?

In the version of the WP the OP is using (the one that mentions "John"), the reference numbers are written as [2,5,7]. Therefore, the OP just took out punctuation just like they did for everything else ("theyre", etc.).
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:14:40
it's in the version of the WP the OP seems to be using as [2,5,7] (written as [2][5][7] in the original)
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:12:05
No, I said if you can pick a 5%, then you can get $500 with one Bitcoin. If it sounds like an obvious answer, then blame the question, not the answer.
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:05:59
OP is using a different version of the whitepaper (the one mentioning "John"), and in that version it's written as [2,5,7] instead of [7][2][5].
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:23:17
Try saying it three times in the bathroom mirror.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:13:09
it looks like the program used to make the puzzle removes punctuation, which is why "they're" is written as "theyre." take out the punctuation from [2,5,7] and it gets formatted as 257.

If people get rekt because of shitcoins while Bitcoin is also dropping in price at the same time, I would imagine that would encourage a lot of them to get out of crypto entirely rather than put it all in Bitcoin. We have already seen that when prices drop, not only does Bitcoin's market cap go down, but the entire crypto market cap goes down with it. There's little reason to think that the entire market cap of crypto would simply be transferred into BTC in the event of a major crash. Many (perhaps most) people would just get out.

If you're using a desktop wallet like Electrum's, the private key is on your computer and can possibly be hacked if someone gets into your computer. If it's in cold storage, that means it's offline and can't be accessed by hackers.

A Ponzi scheme requires one person or company collecting all the money and redistributing some of it to make it look like some are profiting. There is no one person selling all of this Bitcoin, so it can't possibly be a Ponzi scheme.

In terms of setting aside the Bitcoin on a website and not having it released until you get what you are exchanging it for, that's how the website localbitcoins works, but there you would be selling the Bitcoin for money. I don't know of any way of doing that by exchanging Bitcoin for goods, especially independently. I would not pay for something over the internet in Bitcoin unless I trusted who I was doing business with, because once you send them your Bitcoin, there's nothing you can do if you don't receive what you were buying.

It's a good question. I would say it has to do with people's opinions about the future of BTC. Many people believe that crypto will be the currency type of the future and that BTC will be the standard bearer because it seems to be getting more attention than others in terms of pioneer businesses accepting it as payment, etc. In other words, BTC will be more valuable in the future because people will trust its value more than other cryptocurrencies in the future, the same way that people around the world today trust the USD, EUR, and GBP more than other fiat currencies.

You're right. It wasn't a hack in which they broke into people's wallets without their control. But what was done can still be termed a "hack," can it not? It seems like we're arguing semantics here..

You can't just use any old USB stick--it has to have software installed on it to act as a wallet. That's what hardware wallets like Trezors and Ledger Nanos are. If you don't want to pay for them, you could print out a paper wallet, as long as you're not worried about losing it or someone finding it. Another option is to put a "paper" wallet in a file format on an encrypted USB stick instead of printing it. But since you don't have a huge amount, I agree with the user who said that the most sensible option for you is a desktop wallet like Electrum.

But the DNS servers didn't break down -- someone hijacked them to redirect MEW customers to a phishing website in Russia. It's a fair point to say that the site itself was not hacked, but this was clearly a hack.
