You should definitely take the time to listen to what he has to say. It's a pretty deep talk, and he does mention dogecoin and how it doesn't matter if it has a dog on the front of it. Andrew Jackson is on the face of a 20 dollar bill. Does that matter? Andreas basically points out that people have been forced to use their nation's currency until now. Many of these altcoins may not have value, but some will. What if Justin Beiber made his own coin and his fans only used beibercoins? Industries would have to accept beibercoins and convert them to another currency or they'd lose business.

What if your tenant lives many miles away? You'll have to arrange a meeting if you want to transact in "real money". It also means you run the risk of accepting counterfeit notes or being robbed. With bitcoin, the tenant could pay over skype. You could convert it to the fiat currency of your choice and have it deposited into your bank account.
So you're right about most companies converting it into another form of currency....but that actually highlights a useful advantage of bitcoin. And we have no idea how much bitcoin companies will hold in the future.

Maybe I'm out of the loop about the price of rings, but I lol'd when I saw how much they were asking. I'm rather certain I could buy the metal (which has been declining in price) and have that same ring made for much cheaper. Who knows, maybe a 3-d printer?

Taxing carbon and methane gas. He secured $3.2 billion in the economic stimulus package for grants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in a program that has funded upgrades for more than 86,000 buildings and installed more than 9,500 solar energy systems.

That's not true. There's already lots of economic research into how his policies will save money in the long run.
