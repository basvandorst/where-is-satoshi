THANK GOD for the internet, where people soft as butter in real life can turn into gangsters online. I dont have an opinion either way, but alot of immature dialogue from what I am assuming are adults.

Good for u, welcome to fun world of bitcoin tipping :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:24:28
Im using coinbase and put them in the vault option. Seems like best wallet option

I heard about bitcoin in December 13. Became intrigued. I am a anti bank guy and have been storing metals little by little for years. Bitcoin was right up my alley. Then I saw that I could earn little as they may be "bits" of bitcoin without actually investing any real money. I thought to myself, if theres even a sliver of a chance this thing goes to the moon like some people were saying I should at least get this thing going. So I opened up a wallet on coinbase and began literally grinding all the faucets, PTC sites and anywhere I could find bitcoin being given away. It has become quite the hobby. I still have not invested one cent in that particular wallet and after almost eleven months I have a shade under 2 BTC. By no means alot of money, and may seem like a complete waste of time, maybe it was. But my profit margin is infinite and when the swings go up and down it really doesn't bother me. I created value from zero. I tell anyone who will listen that they should at very least grind some free ones and get in the game. During the course of this journey I have read anything anf everything I can about bitcoin and believe that if the right things fall into place, this can really be the future. Like anything else speculative no1 knows for sure, or we all would be rich. But for me its been fun to be a part of in my miniscule capacity.

I think with it all being fairly new (change tipping), I think its not too out of line to make small bit tips right now. It is the hope that it takes hold with people, and makes it mainstream.  Its hopefully another avenue to advance bitcoin.  I think its ok to toss around small amounts back and forth now, one penny, one dollar, your getting rich with neither one.  But if things like this help advance the overall cause, then its good for ALL of us.

From December 2013 until October 2014. I used many different faucets and won a little on takemybitcoins game show. I can link all faucets I used if u have any interest, im sure u probably use most already :) took dedication was going to stop at one but keep going. I view bitcoin like a stock. I wish I could earn parts of berkshire Hathaway or yahoo or apple on a faucet or PTC lol

Well this is pretty cool. In my city, as im sure in many others as well, there are alot of slum landlords. If your not from the area and know the names, you could walk into a gross situation (been there before). Great concept, I hope this takes off it definitely fills a need
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:04:09
Been talking about it today in other bitcoin subs and alot outside US didn't even realize it was happening. Good for ALL of us
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:37:07
I saw this on twitter and responded directly to him
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:45:32
Looks like im way late lol. Love the giveways regardless. Spread the good word of bitcoin

Dudes a legend in stock gamer no one garners more respect. However if Buffet woke up 2mrw losing the equivalent of Bitcoins market capitalization, it would be of little change to his quality of life. If things start to go the way many of us think/hope....and hes still ticking....his tune will change

Dump right before sale, rebuy right after when price drops when those transactions go thru
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:43:44
0 is possible, $1,000,000 is possible, $200 is possible, $500 is possible….kind of get the point?  Just like the dollar could possibly crash to worthless, and then maybe it never does.  In the world of finances, almost anything is possible. The likelihood of these events occurring is maybe the better question
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:08:51
Bitcoin baby!
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:11:44
Yea get them bits flying around, I love seeing snoop or tosh or other celebrities getting tips on twitter and love watching bitcoin continue to grow. Nothing better than getting someone excited about bitcoin that yesterday was not. Happy tipping tuesday bitcoiners

Awesome answers and perspectives, thanks to those that took time to answer. I agree with much that was stated
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:53:30
Rarely do I see large scale tips flying around, alot of times small amounts of bits are passed around.  Social media creates a double edged sword.  We have the great opportunity to interact with people from all corners of the world and many different cultures.  On the flip side we are so used to interacting online our real world interpersonal communication skills suffer.  That being said, I think sending friendly amounts of bits to comments you like, or tasks people complete is great for the ecosystem.  We are still in the infancy of this technology/digital currency. Anything we can do to introduce it to a more mainstream audience,  can only be seen as a positive, IMO

If BTC hits $1 no more lottery tickets and dollar menu items for this guy  couldn't resist. Seriously please invest rationally people, never plow whole net worth into anything.....unless martha strewart is your broker of course, lol 
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:43:43
Really? Why is this not getting more press especially within the bitcoin community.  How serious is it? The price has remained fairly stable the last few days while this has been going on as well.
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:40:20
Does this count if one of your referrals in "last" 90 days ends up buying $100 or just new ones going forward. And does this replace the $1 or $5 just to get them to sign up. Neither are complaints, just curious, thanks.

US government fears anything that is a threat to their continued ability to tax the shit out of their citizens. As well as a threat to traditional (too big to fail bail out banks) who last year took 30mil+ in just over draft fees from its customers. The US history is littered with the government making shit up as they go along circumventing real laws and rights.  Full disclosure I live and was born in US. Every day I get closer and closer to that anti establishment camp, this unfortunately not surprising.

What are u looking for exactly? Creating memes and gifs and posting to the fb page or something else, and how would u figure to pay $5 in btc per hour, maybe small TX per submit thats accepted? 
@_date: 2016-07-27 18:14:25
Absolutely, huge bitcoin fan, love funny stuff, seems like a reasonable match for me :)

A consumer suggestion, offer a rewards program unique to your bitcoin spenders. The same way merchants offer spend X amount of dollars receive X off next purchase. Or better yet, offer a point system that earns real dollar value and can be redeemed for cash value and add a % say 10% or so if redeemed and used with bitcoin. I dont know what type of business or product you are selling, but rewards programs are usually good at pumping in more business. If you are comfortable with weighting the incentives towards bitcoin redemption,  should see a spike with savvy consumers
