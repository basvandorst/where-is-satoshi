Can you elaborate on this? ELI5 if you don't mind :)
I know that if someone has access to my private key they have access to my bitcoins but, is there any other case when it doesn't mind if someone can access the private key? You mentioned BIP-32 public chain. Are there other kinds?

I'm not sure about the fees. I thought it was more logical to just import the key and that's it. I guess I'll have to send the money to the other address.

Because I want to migrate to Bitcoin Core. I have some fractions of bitcoin in MultiBit HD and I **also** have a wallet in Bitcoin Core with some fractions of bitcoin. I really don't like MultiBit HD.

It's fully synced.
Thanks for the advice, I will do that.

I'll empty the wallet, definitely.
I don't like how it's made and how you have to use it. I can't explain technically but I don't find it comfortable to use. I like Bitcoin Core more because it's simpler. I don't need too many functions.

I'm a noob using Bitcoin but I'll try to elaborate a bit more.
First of all: I don't like being asked my password when I start the application. I find it more useful to be asked for the password when you are actually going to spend your money, as BTC Core does.
Then it also looks that, instead of being me who owns the wallet, it's the application. It makes me backup it in the cloud (what if I don't want to?) and I can't have a look at the keys or back them up printed on a paper. I would like to have more control over it, at least via command line like in BTC Core.
And the looks of it. It looks like it's an application made in HTML and CSS (I'm totally wrong with this, but it does look weird), and that's just unconfortable. All I ask from these applications is simplicity: Send, receive, sign, verify, export keys, import keys, encrypt the wallet and not much else.
Also, the translation is a bit bad, but that's OK.

Also bear in mind that Adblock Plus does not block "non intrusive" ads by default (those ads).

I know; that's why I said by default.
