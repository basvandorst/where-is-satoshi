The light-blue was originally 0-5. That changed to 2-5 so thats when the big chunk of 1-2 appeared on the graph suddenly. It just increases so drastically because it **replaced a big part of the previous 0-5 zone**.
The node where this graph is getting the data from **has a limit on how much of the mempool it will hold** so as the mempool grew beyong that limit, the node began dropping the lowest-fee txs. That is why the big 0-2 chunk (and up to the green 20-30 zone) started disappearing suddenly.
Hope this explains it clearly as I had this same doubt.

Generally true, but just wanted to point out that a &lt;1 sat/b fee is technically feasible.

This user has another post which was deleted and had the "malware/phishing" tag. I wouldn't try this.

Thanks this was exactly what I was looking for. I expected some files to be identical across systems. Do you know why isn't this the case? What information is making it different?
About getting my blocks from an untrusted source...wouldn't Core notice there's a longer verified chain and give up the fake one as it would be etiher invalid or shorter than the current chain?
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:23:11
Great to know this! Thanks a lot!

Thanks for your service. I did the same a couple of years ago and haven't stopped. Feels great to help.

Yes, first of all, **DON'T REVEAL THOSE WORDS** to anyone trying to help.
Those 12 words are what it's called a seed. Addresses are generated from that seed so don't lose that.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:16:28
I wouldn't call this 'false'. You are right, users using SegWit addresses is also necessary but is doesn't make what I said false.
As an example, for it to rain there needs to be clouds and falling water drops. Saying that you need water falling from the sky for it to rain isn't false. Saying it needs to be cloudy to be raining isn't false either. (Of couse this is just an example and there could be some weird scenarios where this doesn't apply)

Actually, it's called Bitcoin. SegWit effectively increased block size to 4MB maximum (for upgraded-SegWit-enabled nodes of course). Miners just haven't set their maximum size yet. Seems BitFury is leading in that regard.

Try these
Also, **don't ever hand your seed to other people** who claim can help you recover funds. As soon as they get the seed they control the money and it's possible that they never send it back to you.

Did you have a simple password or what? Do you have a Teamviewer account or only using the numbers provided to connect? This is really intriguing as it seems to be so insecure.
