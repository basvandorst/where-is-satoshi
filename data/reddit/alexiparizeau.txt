well yes. I just meant that no matter how big the network effect of bitcoin, it's possible that it can be dwarfed by an even larger network that meets a different need for a population larger than the humans using bitcoin. This larger network can exist if its needs are greater than (but include) the capabilities of bitcoin. I'm referring to fully autonomous systems, drones and corporations (a sort of frankenstein version of the Internet of Things, where the Things do commerce with themselves, and maybe a bit with us).

Here's an argument that uses Metcalfe's law to explain how another crypto can replace bitcoin: the value of bitcoin is based on how many humans will use it in the future, but if there is a proportionately larger number of software entities that will use a different crypto in the future, then that crypto will have more value and thus it will attract humans to it as well. Of course, it's more likely that any new population segment will just use bitcoin, unless they specifically needed a different crypto to do effective commerce.

Inspired thoughts. You should have a chat with these guys 
If I could add something new to the discussion, I'd offer the idea that all of our fictions about computer AI taking over the world is fuelled by pyramid thinking. The concept of an AI takeover (ie Skynet) assumes that centralization is the future, that a hierarchical authority structure is the dominant strategy. But should you be right (should we all be right), then there won't be robot overlords. Even the term overlord is an artefact of centuries past. If the dominant strategy is trust-free decentralization, then our cultural fears as they relate to AGI (artificial general intelligence) may be misguided. And that gives me hope.
(I wonder if the guys at MIRI might find inspiration in bitcoin for their quest to discover an approach to friendly AI..  )
