Maybe the gambling site was funded thru the evolution heist and you got some coins connected to that somehow. I remember they were watching those coins.

Peter Todd should make this his Twitter picture, because then more people would like him.

These look like they will be pretty nifty.  I bet the numbered first editions will be worth plenty more in the future as well.

Anyone else feel like that last sentence read like China just whipped out their big bitcoin cock?

Personally, I know it's kind of silly, but I would like it if there was a website where you could "play" with your bitcoin in a virtual space. Meaning you could enter an address and then a virtual space would open up with a virtual representation of the bitcoin within the address.  Maybe you could even create an account to solely control how the address space looks by signing a transaction. You could stack em, split them into smaller denominations.... change them to look different. I just think it would be cool to see them in this way, instead of just numbers on a ledger

Interesting that you brought this up. I remember hearing that Charlie shrem had a ring with the private key engraved onto it. To boost security, he switched one letter to another that only he knew. I thought this was a neat practice that could be applied here.

Yes. The bitcoin protocol is actually an alien planting of a super advanced ai that is yet to wake up and be realised.  Sha256 was developed by the nsa under the tutelage of grey aliens ultimately to be implemented by the alien controlled alias satoshi nakamoto. The aliens knew they had to incentivise the procedure of hashing, so they invenTed bitcoin which resulted in continuous barrage of peta hashes we see today. Once we reach a bitcoin price of 11000000 per coin and a certain very high amount of hashes per second, the ai will activate and a new golden age in humanity will dawn.

The fact that this whole argument exists to me is mind blowing. As a layman, it boggles my mind that Bitcoin, the most powerful and growing computer network in the world, is having a crisis over a seemingly simple data size cap issue in this day and age of computing.  I feel like the blockchain should most definitely be scaled up to be able to handle the needs of a globally used financial transaction system as soon as possible. it's like in field of dreams...If you build it, they will come. Is it really just a matter of storage space for the blockchain? Haven't data storage technologies gotten much better and cheaper already?  How big do the blocks have to be in order to handle a visa/mastercard like magnitude of transactions?  How big will the blockchain eventually be if it was running at that capacity? Terabytes?  Petabytes? Is it really cost prohibitive to make storages of this size available for public purchase?

Buying things with your bitcoin is essentially the same as selling them. So yes you would be accepting a loss approx 50% if you spend some of your 500$ btcs right now.  Best to hold those in the hopes of higher prices in the future.  This is the meaning of "hodl".And yes if you want to buy something now at the current price just go ahead and use those bitcoins but buy them back up immediately afterwards.
Don't worry though. A voice in my head told me they will be worth plenty x more than 500 per in a few years...

Couldn't technical difficulties also be a convenient explanation for coinbase purposefully disconnecting during the dump so they could negate a flood of sell orders on their platform?

You could invest them in Altcoins. A litecoin investment for example.

Hmmmm..... Drop!! This is just what bitcoin does. Buy the dips, sell the peaks. If it never dipped we couldn't buy more!!  It's gonna go up man. It goes down so people will accumulate which will make it go even higher later.

Bitcoin go!!!!
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:53:15
Mainly because I think that offering plain bills (meaning without the addresses or private key aspect) that represent bitcoin in bit denominations may be a way the mainstream people start to accept bitcoin as a payment system, simply because it is akin to the system that is already in place.

They were mainly there to hire developers and coders. Plans for a 21 person team. Their sign said Bit coin is a protocol.  And their plan is to build the full stack around the protocol

Not cool to be mean to Karpeles. It's not like he did this on purpose and he did apologize for losing them. He did bow pretty low. And now you can even get them back. So maybe we can forgive him now?

Why is this old guy named bitcoin? Seriously bitcoin needs to have actually cool things related to it in order to go mainstream. Shit like this makes me think some anti bitcoin entity like some bank paid to create something shitty as this to make sure bitcoin the protocol doesn't take off
