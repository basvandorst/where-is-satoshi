Why not send lots of small amounts so there are more winners?  like 1 btc to 200 accounts and then 800 to a big winner or what ever

I've had my s2 for over 2 years now and the phone works like a charm. The battery isn't what it used to be don't get me wrong but it's not horrible. All in all, its an incredible phone :)

I was with Cex.io, which sells Ghash and they mine on Ghash.io for you. I have recently sold it though, but that doesnt matter though because when you sell, some one buys. Ghash continues.
