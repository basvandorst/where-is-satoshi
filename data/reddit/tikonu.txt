As a side note, you can use 
 to avoid paying coinbase fees. It's the exact same exchange, owned by the same people. 
 Load up $ to coinbase but then spend it via gdax with a limit buy.
GDax limit buy info:

LTC uses a memory-intensive algorithm rather than bitcoin's more processor heavy one.  This approach is a big improvement on bitcoin's ability to scale, yet it is arguably easier for hackers to overcome.

Well, I try to be.  It's nothing inherent to the algorithm, but the belief is that it leads to greater centralization which leads to less security.

Coinbase is the bank, GDax is the exchange - same company, different websites.  You can deposit your coinbase money on GDax, then do a limit buy for no charge.

I was under the impression that SegWit only sets the stage for LN, it is not an implementation of it.  I know Charlie Lee has a live interview on YouTube today, I'm curious if he's going to announce some progress with LN between bitcoin and litecoin.  Long shot?

Memory intensive algorithms are also ASIC resistant, but that detail speaks more to how decentralized a coin is.

They do, but can they afford it?  I have seen exactly 0 lambos out on the road today, but I suspect it's not because people don't want them.
I'm wondering - could additional countries/people struggle to come into Bitcoin, just like your average Joe struggles to come into the coveted lambo?

I think that's the point of Litecoin in conjunction with Bitcoin.  LTC is less secure by design, which allows it to be faster and less costly to use. "Silver to Bitcoin's gold" as he keeps calling it.  You'd buy a car or house via bitcoin, you'd store large amounts with Bitcoin, but it might never be viable to use it for the ever-sought-after cup of coffee.  That kind of security overhead just isn't viable for a $2 transaction.
The Lightning network should smooth out the transition between the two and then hopefully we've got most any financial situation solved for.  Of course, it could end up being some other altcoin or coins that fill this gap, but LTC is bent solely on that vision.

It was argued that the approach led to more centralization which would mean less security.  Personally, I don't see it working out that way or even being that problematic if it did.  If it's gonna go that way, it's gonna go that way.

I would respectfully disagree.  Bitcoin has not achieved mass adoption, as we as investors would still be considered "early adopters".  I heard recently that we're less than 2% of the population.  Another article earlier this year said there are only 10 million of us.
I've got to think some crazy stuff would go down if mass adoption really kicked off.

I've moved Ether and LTC out of GDax to a Trezor, it didn't charge me anything (to my surprise).  I didn't even see a network fee.  I sent an even number, received an even number.

Coinbase issues, they've shut down credit and debit payment methods.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:49:59
Bug or feature???

Use gdax - same company, same accounts, no fees.  You can just spend out of the USD account you have on coinbase through gdax.  Coinbase is the bank, gdax is the exchange.

When the sun rises in the West and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves...  Then it will return, and not before.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:13:55
Well, I mean.. Have you used it as actual currency?  'Cuz the lower fees feel pretty unique when you do.. haha.  LTC also scales better than BTC.

Only for those of us with friends (haha)
