Start on what, Bitcoin?
You'll need a Bitcoin wallet with an address to receive coins at. To start, I'd recommend a web wallet with an average level of security. In the future you can look into alternate storage methods. 
Create a new Gmail address and activate 2 factor authentication. Next, set up a wallet on Blockchain.info, and enable 2 factor auth there as well. Be sure to use unique, complex passwords for both accounts. Edit: also, don't choose a username you have used before, and use different usernames on each website.
Then you can write a sell ad on the subreddit, and see if anyone is interested. I'd suggest putting in a picture or two of each item, like you were suggesting in your OP. That should be enough to get you started, feel free to send a post if you have any more questions.

That's why I said fiat, not value. That's exactly why people complain about the FED - because they devalue the currency.

You sent Bitcoin to Mt. Gox, and sold it for market price. The sale happened instantly, and your USD balance on Mt. Gox increased. Business as usual.
The problems began when trying to actually get money sent from Mt. Gox to your bank account. 
Delays started happening for some users. Weeks turned into months. The worst part was that you would occasionally see a post by someone who did receive a bank transfer (whether those were real or not we'll never know). So you patiently waited your turn.

Have you tried Localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:41:03
Just to be clear on this before we start, Bitcoin payments are irreversible. Make sure you trust the vendor to deliver before you hit send!
First you will need to get your hands on some Bitcoin. To receive Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin *wallet*.
Do you have an Android phone? 
* If yes, download the "Mycelium" Bitcoin wallet.
* If no, register an account on [blockchain.info](
Your wallet will by default usually contain 1 Bitcoin *address* (but can contain many different addresses). A Bitcoin address is usually 26 characters of numbers and letters, and begins with a 1. Example: [1KeBs4HBQzkdHC2ou3gpyGHqcL7aKzwTve]( Feel free to generate more addresses if you would like, the number of possible addresses is astronomical.
You can now give that address out so that people can send you Bitcoin. There are many different ways to acquire Bitcoin, which will vary depending on where you are in the world. 
* If you don't mind linking your bank account and waiting to verify, create an account on [coinbase.com]( and begin the verification process. 
* If you don't mind paying a little extra for privacy, see if you can find a seller in your area using [localbitcoins.com]( Cash trades or bank deposit are probably your best bet.
I would suggest buying a little more BTC than you think you will need in order to cover small transaction fees, and fluctuations in price. 
You're almost done, at this point you can ask the vendor for his Bitcoin address and send him the payment. 
If you need clarification on any of these points, ask here or start a new post in I would highly encourage you to research a bit more before you continue but hopefully this gives you an idea of what you'll have to do. 
Good luck.

Well, it makes sense that the mods don't want their sub used as an advertising platform, especially when you're trying to sell for a niche currency like Bitcoin. I'm sure they wouldn't mind if you posted some high quality images though, and maybe people would ask for more info from there. Don't post there expecting a sale, but for the sake of posting content the viewers would enjoy.
If you don't get any offers you might consider reposting in a couple days. People usually won't look past the first page (unless they're using the search function). If you're not spamming I think that should be ok, but double check the rules before you do. 
Anyway, Good luck guys. Post here or send me a message if you have any more questions. You can also try posting to for general Bitcoin inquiries.

Well, theoretically, you would tell the truth to protect your family if they were in danger. So if you tell the intruder you no longer have the coins, he should assume you are telling the truth. He can call your bluff, but he runs the risk of harming people and still not receiving any payoff. As long as they aren't certain you have the coins, you should be sufficiently protected.
I propose that anyone who would pistol whip others without a guaranteed payout is irrational (or desperate), and cannot be reasoned with. Even if you did give this person your coins, they might assume you were only giving up a small portion of your holdings. You're screwed either way.
@_date: 2014-09-09 09:36:38
Except that the FED can create fiat forever (at least, until everyone leaves the system). Satoshi can only sell his holdings once.
The price is irrelevant; if the fundamentals are the same, Bitcoin has value.

When I did trades like this I would always meet on the second floor of a food-court. Basically, a public area far away from any vehicles. First person there will dictate where the trade takes place, so arrive early. I liked to sit in a corner with my back to the wall; you just want to make sure no-one can come up behind you. 
I also liked to buy food and slowly eat it while you wait for the person. When they arrive, they see you eating which should subconsciously indicate to them that you plan on sticking around. 
Carry your money in an envelope. People will notice if someone is counting a wad of cash in a public place. Even though what you're doing is legal, I would try not to attract attention as security might assume you are making a drug deal. Face the bills, and count your stack 3-4 times. You need to be 100% certain that you have the correct amount to hand him. Also your entire stack should be $100s. 
If the seller has funded the transaction through LBC, he has already proven that he has sufficient Bitcoin. Because of this, you as the buyer should hand over the cash to verify before he releases the BTC. Pass him the cash in the envelope and give him a minute to count it.
Other options would be to concealed carry, or bring a friend along. If you bring a friend, tell him to give you a 5 minute head start and when he gets there to sit somewhere between you and the exit.
After the transaction is complete, your worries are over. You might want to log in to LBC to verify you received the coins, but tbh the secret code should be sufficient confirmation. 
If his rep is good, you should be fine. I did a few trades like this last year and never had any problems.

Don't sell to anyone in this community. Any method someone can pay you with can be (and probably will be) reversed. I'm sure many people here would love to buy cheap Bitcoin but the safest route for YOU is to do a trade on Localbitcoins where you exchange your Bitcoin for cash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:57:22
How did you perform the transaction? You need a Bitcoin address to receive Bitcoins. If he gave you a paper wallet, that's basically him giving you access to an address he controls. Either way you should transfer your coin to a wallet only you control. Set up a wallet on Blockchain.info, you can generate an address from there and use it to store your coins temporarily. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:57:58
I experienced this today while performing a $5k transaction. Very stressful. Thankfully the website still allowed me to release the coins by clicking "Release Funds" (used my phone's browser). I know my 2 factor was working properly because I was still able to log in with it. Hoping I never experience this error again.

Yes that's why I'd recommend doing cash only. Bitcoin is like cash, irreversible. You basically hope that the person sending you money through other means is honest, but you can't trust anyone. Actually, I would cease contact with everyone in this thread. You can still open an ad on Localbitcoins, but I don't think you want people you meet to possibly know you have created this thread. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:26:11

If you have created a new wallet and can see a balance of 10 BTC there by searching the address on Blockchain.info, you're ok. 
Nobody will care if the Bitcoin were used to purchase drugs, you're fine. If you want to cash out, set up a limited sell on Localbitcoins.com and wait until someone buys from you. Because you got them so cheap you could sell them under market price and someone will likely message you soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:31:27

Wow, another post about "almost" buying in 3 years ago. Just because someone mentioned the word "Bitcoin" to you in the last 3 years doesn't mean you were about to buy in. If you were almost about to buy, you would have. Again, you weren't "almost" about to accept that offer because... you didn't. 
You are making this post because you regret not taking a risk. You made the safe choice taking the cash. In hindsight it wasn't the right choice, but it was definitely the safe one. When you have a family to take care of, you take the safe choice every time. Imagine if you had accepted Bitcoin, but it had dropped to zero for some reason. If you believe in Bitcoin's potential you can still buy in, it's not too late. Just remember that there is still a risk.
