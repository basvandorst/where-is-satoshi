an item referring to Vegeta is needed.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:58:00
well, you caught me.

2nd rule of Bitcoin club: never pay attention to what banks say.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:05:26
where is vegeta?

Blockchain isn't an innovation itself. A blockchain is only possible if exists an incentive for those supporting the Network.

Almost everything uses internet today. Every business, service, etc. If they collude just to collapse Bitcoin, they will be well screwed too and won't gain anything.

I should have done the same a few years ago. The car was just a burden and I had to sell it later.

Of course. We are basically an IT guy and a friend good in business. 
Tell me how would you like to provide :)

We know there are lower prices, but most of those prices are for people with trader level accounts from brokers that require several verification steps and movements. Consider we also added many familiar payment methods in a secure e-commerce site.
Now, we are researching on how to provide better prices here in Chile like bigger brokers such as Buda . This is our retail-like approach that honestly adds more costs, but we think is perfect for tiny volumes and getting into bitcoin without being scammed.

do you know about segwit and lightning network? You should read about these new Bitcoin features that are intended to solve most of the problem you might be referring to. One of the most beautiful things about software is that it can be improved.

The same picture have been shared again and again in the previous bitcoin "crashes". 
@_date: 2018-06-01 03:34:30
Well, that is right, everything seems to be possible today. 
But under such an apocalyptic scenario, I think money may be the least of our problems.

blockchain is a consequence of developing bitcoin. Does it have other use cases? of course! but why would anyone spend money in machines and energy to support the blockchain without a monetary incentive? People that supports blockchain but not bitcoin reflects the post truth era.

bitcoin memes are the best memes I have ever seen...

"a share" = I did not understand wtf Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:27:33
prepare your best memes...
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:43:50
But he is right.

Roger Ver is a very shitty person and a dirty businessman too. First using an absurd argument when talking about babies dying because of Bitcoin and now putting "his own creation" above original Bitcoin with this type of nasty social attack. I am not a baby but I am dying of angry because of people like Ver. Peace.
