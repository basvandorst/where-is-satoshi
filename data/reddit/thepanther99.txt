"Your in for 3k"

I bought on the dip.

@_date: 2018-01-16 18:21:38
Id buy 5 if it got that low
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:26:51
Fuck stripe. Not just because they dont support bitcoin. They are very strict on merchants in other industries. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:22:16
investing all your money into something is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:42:03
If prices drop to 1-2k omg im buying at least 5. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:17:24
Exactly. This reminds me of that episode from the black mirror. Season 1 episode 2. 15 million metris. Inflation will play a big part in bitcoins price going to crazy levels.

You can build an actual business with 10-20k. Lots of people will lose their ass for not making sound investments. Im just watching eating my popcorn. I may not get to drive a lambo anytime soon from a huge bitcoin spike but my business is very consistent and doesn't rely on speculation. Be smart people. Ignorance is the easiest way to lose it all.

Buying it would be extremely hard if the government really wanted to stop it. ie they could make it impossible to connect your bank account to these exchanges to buy crypto. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:21:27
Sorry to say but you're not going to get rich off crypto. A lot of people fell for the easy money. Nows the time to actually build a skillset before another recession hits. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 09:30:35
lol! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:06:00
eh, you underestimate peoples panic levels. Look at history. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:17:23
do what ever the FUCK you wanna do lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:41:17
Terrible name honestly. No ones taking that seriously. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:03:26
True, but most people wouldn't want to do this. Only reason why new people are investing is because its easy to buy. Once people have to start doing weird shit the get btc the value will go right back to $300. Maybe even lower. I wont be going to some sketchy underground tunnel to buy bitcoin. I dont really care about it THAT much. Nor does my business revolve around any illegal activity that needs me to conceal my money. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:16
ill have to man up and buy 10 if it goes down to 1k. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:52:34
Because they know a lot of people will lose their ass when bitcoin tanks. And most Americans dont pay off their credit cards. Smart move. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:52:43
Yea it will. But by then the people who couldnt hold wont be realizing any profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:49:26
Literally the other day I told someone on this thread if the government really wanted to make it impossible to buy bitcoin they can just prevent you from using your card or bank to buy. Coinbase makes buying ctypto really easy. But if you take away the ease of use price will drop back to 1-2k. Non tech savvy individuals aren't going to buy crypto the old fashioned way if this where to happen. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:18:36
Pretty much, made an automatic investment of $20 today @ a strike price of about 9.2k. feels good. Prob gonna raise that to $200 monthly. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:48:59
yup
