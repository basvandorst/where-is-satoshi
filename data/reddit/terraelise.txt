haha, good catch, sorry about that! (editing original comment to fix)

Mostly ditto (I got to the party in Feb) - with caveat that even if BTC doesn't change the world, something soon will. It feels like the start of tomorrow... it may fail, or it may moon, but at least it's asking the right questions about technology, economics, corporate manipulation and government control - and that is worth supporting in one way or another.

I am "okay" with segwit alone (I think...), but changing blocksize is totally pointless (even the BCH to 8) as it doesn't increase transactions anywhere near Visa (my chosen standard) - it doesn't solve the problem in the long term at all. Kicking a can down the road is just poor programming IMO. Smells of some sort of gimmick or grab by opposing forces. Disclaimer: I have no facts to back up my feelings.

I don't understand the question. If BTC crashed, I'd buy. If you don't cash out to other currency, you haven't lost anything.

Does this qualify as deserving of "Nice try, FBI?"

Science be good, what is this nonsense? Who is paying for it to be all up in my face today?

It is relevant: I follow Bitcoin news and a centralized AML coin is being promoted as the replacement. I wanted to know what other users thought of who was promoting the Forbes article and opinions on altcoins that call themselves 'bitcoin.'

I am paranoid so it is distressing that so many people hold more than 5 coins on a single address. It's akin to carrying 1000 dollar bills - so easy to lose. I suppose if you're rich it isn't painful to lose...

LMAO + question: there's oatmeal in my heart? Or just in males hearts?
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:46:26
Really? Never heard that before. I've been on small amounts auto weekly on cc for a few months - so far no issues. Should I be concerned?

No idea, but droid app did this to me for a noticed half hour today.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:38:12
that is some wishful, or suicidal, thinking

this is not easy, i have no idea how to start using their API and I have Dev experience.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:52:49
i cannot trade at gdax, it asks be to sign in to coinbase, which is down - i have no clue how to get around that / use the APIs
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:45:46
ditto... no idea in US where to exchange between cryptos (other than gdax, which is down)
