$2.5 million from about 10 investors?
That's only 250k per.  Haha.  Yikes.

I've been in the space since 2012.  This NDA makes sense, because here is what happened years ago.
Small inner circle has Satoshi's keys.
Scaling debate heats up.
Small inner circle recruits Gavin for their fork to give it credibility.
Gavin won't join unless he sees proof of Satoshi's keys.
Inner circle freaks out, because first rule of inner circle is to not talk about inner circle.
"Fake Satoshi" volunteers to show Gavin Satoshi's keys.
*This part is most important*
Gavin makes mistake and goes public saying, "I think I met Satoshi".
Fake Satoshi has no choice but to go public and makes a fool of himself on BBC
Inner circle praises Fake Satoshi as a hero because he is sticking to the narrative
This narrative doesn't matter in the long run, because it's small inner circle that HAS Satoshi's keys, and Fake Satoshi is part of that inner circle.
*Think of it as a guy taking one for the team*
Fake Satoshi want's an NDA so he can prove that the group he is a part of, has Satoshi's keys, but he in fact is not Satoshi, and would disclose what I said above, but Andrea's would not be allowed to tell anyone, hence the NDA.
Gavin is working on graphene, and blocks will never be full.
At Satoshi Vision conference, the inner circle will present to the world that they hold Satoshi's private keys.  Check mate.
