This is a good thing, I base my buys and sells on front page news.  Once front page news, I selllllll. Try to do the opposite of what mainstream media portrays.

We need to have a bitcoin pizza day.  Have the community spend a little bit of our coins, to promote usage..... Any takers?  Something of the sort,to promote the utility.   Even if it anither token/coin.  Send some to a friend, but something and let the world know we arent going away!

Bitcoin is the era's gold. We need the developers to continue to improve upon it (ie lightning, etc).  We are still the earky adopters and have the oower and say to influence the future, lets make sure we cibtibue this in the correct path.

Totally, speculate on those where utility of the token seems possible, and hopefully get lucky on one.   Always do your own research as well and be very wary on the information coming out, especially during the run.   Just put on your seatbelts. 
Funny thing is, so many jumped off the bandwagon when it dropped, I have been hinting to fellow friends to jump back on the wagon, but im thinking their FOMO will be a tad too late again... OH WELL!  Keep accumulating friends...
