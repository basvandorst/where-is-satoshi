Just curiously, how did you decide on a 6% fee?  We're working on something very similar, and a fee of 2% or less was the cost we were deciding on.

It would make it really easy to cancel subscriptions.  Just drain the account, and nothing more could be billed.

Thank you for that lesson in complex math.  Good luck with your service.  Overall I think this is good for the BTC community.

In response to 1, would you say that volatility is the main deterrent for merchants?  Bitcoins are much cheaper than credit cards in terms of fees, so its unclear what is holding merchants back.
Problem 2 seems like it comes down to BC exchanges, and their shortcomings.  There definitely needs to be more innovation and improvement in these areas.

I agree with the chicken and egg analogy you made earlier.  However, I read an article that claimed BitPay is gaining 1000+ merchants per month.  If that rate holds, won't this problem take care of itself?
Also, there are opportunities to use the currency for transactions that aren't just online retail.  These haven't caught on yet though.  Any ideas how to tackle that?

That's a good idea.  Would the email account have to be tied to an address beforehand?

We mainly want people that currently use bitcoins for some kind of financial transaction.  However, if you never use coins, but would like to in the future, we would like your inout as well.  It might be a good call to add an "other" option to the survey.

This sounds like a cool idea.  What are your thoughts on a subscription service client, or something that sets up recurring payments?  This could be a huge improvement in current commerce capabilities

Good point.  However we think we would get the most adoption going for people that already make some transactions.  Ideally we could introduce services to new BTC owners as well.

It seems like there is a need for recurring payments.  Thanks for a really good suggestion.
