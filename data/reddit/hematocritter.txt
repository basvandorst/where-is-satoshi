Someone who knows the history of BTC will likely find it decent, if not a bit dumbed down and a little dull through the parts where the director turns to focusing on the mystery of who Satoshi is. I'd say it's a good primer for newbies, certainly.

Once again, not bad ideas, pretty conservative and the opposite end of the guys telling everyone to HODL and buy Lambos. One thing I have yet to see is someone saying how it comes down to having your own goals and being aware of what will sustain the "rich" life you want to lead. You could take just a couple hundred and start a small business, thus freeing yourself from a job you hate or giving you extra income. You might be rich if you have an extra $1,000 a month after bills, as another example. Maybe you won't be happy until you have enough money to travel for three years and generally-accepted-good-advice like buying a house would be unwise.
Whatever it is, appreciate these guys' wisdom, but don't forget to ask yourself what you really want your money to do for you.

Most of us wouldn't give you a hard time for selling/swapping during an ATH. That's just good investing, and you said it yourself: whatever's going to happen will happen.

You forgot to crassly insult most of your target audience and remind us 15 times how you were a millionaire before Apple Unlimited -- but other than that, successful launch.

Can we also talk about this Lady?  I have never wanted to sit down and explain basic financial concepts to someone I don't know so much in my life.
