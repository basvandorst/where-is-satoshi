I will try one last time. Mind you, I am not from England and I can not nor I wont make up in this comment your lack of education/no interest in economics.
Bitcoin cant be eaten, you cant sleep on it, you cant call it for a party, or have sex with it. Bitcoin is not commodity in its own, it should be a tool to exchange a service or product between two people (im afraid to use entities). Now, belive it or not, Karl Marx you know, that bad communist guy comes into play, I kid you not. For your work in which you invested time and other resources you are awarded with added value, that value is given to you in form of dollars! But what value have a fucking paper you wrote something on it, apart from your mother telling you how sweet it is? None. Thus in beggining money was tied for something that can give you instant "value", gold eg. Today, no money in world is tied in anything but trust that our governments will take care of it (which most of countries do not take care of!). You see, every curency in world is beeing "printed"/issued in order to stimulate inflation, thus in years if you made more money than you can spend it, governments force you to "invest" or over time your amount of money will lose value due to inflation (you can buy less bread in 2018 for 10 dollars than you could buy with 10 dollars in 1960). Therefore, all, or almost all, curencies in world are depriciating in value. That is inflation. Bitcoin on other hand if used by more and more people will award less and less amount eg for added value that your work provides, thus making it deinflatory money. So if you work 8 hours in 2018 you will get 1 bitcoin, but as its grows in value (as there is limited amount of it) aka twice as many people are now working your same job you will get 0.5 bitcoins eg in 2020. Mind you, will be able to buy same amount of bread in 2018 with 1 btc as you will be able to buy in 2020 with 0.5 btc.
As it stands today, bitcoin is nothing but Yahoo of internet and who knows who will be Google or Amazon or maybe Uber that didnt even exist pre year 2000. We all (at least people who understand what is blockchain) know this is fenomenal invention, but no one knows what will future bring us apart from implementation of blockchains in virtual reality as a way to make something unique and not easily replicated/copied.

Yeah, you know it! No cars or electricity was made before Tesla! And no way cryptocurrency can be currency, its just a play of words! cba.

You got no clue, how money works. 
On one hand there can be one dollar and it can be enough for whole world population, or there might be milions of different currencies (not sure if you realise there are other currencies in world beside dollar) and it can still work.
So here, I ask you, what is point of your post? There are more people but less money? Or something other that have nothing to do with economics?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:19:35
I cant justify Tesla either, than again...

They claim it all over this post. Im not native english speaker so from time to time mine wording seem funny I know. Transistors are not 7nm not yet. I cant tell you from mine expertise as Im not semiconductor engineer but from things I read on interwebz. Thing is, some parts of circutry are, but not transistor. Its just marketing. Also, chip only attribute isnt size of transistor. And this is in fact now matured tehnology, history thought us new technology is around corner. 
Now if you ask why Im writting all of this. Well general sentiment in thread is if you buy today gfx/Asic it will stay relevant until end of time since today is 2018 and somone have proven teory that in 2024 speed will be capped.

Bitcoin had never smaller market share in history, but you are right, or at least educated masses from this sub claim.

And here is comment that I wanted to post. To one extent people are ignorant, to other Bitcoin is indirect reason for this. Also, guess this sub out of all crypto is most visited.
