Not exactly. Taxes are on the capital gain, not the full amount. So if I buy a coin for $1 and sell it for $3 I owe taxes on $2.

Wait, I assumed bitcoins hover over my dead body until someone walks by and picks them up...

I’m not a tax expert so hope I didn’t misinterpret. It would be insane to tax the full amount, after 2 or 3 trades there would be nothing left!

Can you afford to lose all of your investment? If no, I would say this is a terrible idea. 
Are you buying the house alone or with a partner? Hopefully you’re alone, but if not make sure your partner is on board with reckless gambling of your down payment.

Pretend everyone except one person holds, so the demand exceeds supply and offer price goes up from 15k to 20k. Only one person sells a coin for 20k, but now the market price and “market cap” is 20k x coins in circulation. 
It’s not intuitive.

2.3 billion out of 450 billion of the current cap was traded in the last 24 hours meaning 0.5% of current owners paid today’s  price. The other 99.5% paid far less.

Bias and loss aversion could have changed your predictions. Who knows, you might have sold it all at 1k. 
Keep moving forward.

Sleep easy, set your floor price as a stop order in gdax.. if it drops below your floor just buy again at a lower price!

Wow, nice. I'm in NJ and pay .19 per kWh. Pseg supply charges are insane here.

I'm not a doctor but I think it was sarcasm...

Seems optimistic. The argument "the whole world is doing something, so why can't we" hasn't worked with healthcare.

Is your employer hiring?
