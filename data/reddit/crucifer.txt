Segwit allows for the signatures to be in a different part that is weighted differently.  To simplify things a lot; this part is allowed to be bigger.
The higher number of in/out you have, the more you can take advantage of that "discounted" space.

I don't want to create a coinbase account.  But I would love to see the charts and buy/sell walls.  Anybody can do a screencap for posterity (and for me)?

You shouldn't import the private key of your samurai wallet anywhere before you see the confirmation that your BTC were transferred successfully to your new wallet.
But assuming you did not confirm and accidentally imported your samurai private key to a BCH wallet.  The worst case I see is that the BCH wallet is not honest and steals your BTC coins.  But that would be surprising.
The next "worst" thing that could happen is that the new wallet sofware creates "two" wallets.  One for the BCH and one with the BTC.  Some software do support multiple different cryptocoins.

Years ago, I received an email asking me if I wanted to be part of the bankrupcy.  Seeing how I had so few bitcoin (less then 1) on mtgox, I thought it was not worth it.  But now, seeing the current value of btc, it would be worth the trouble.  Anybody knows how to get on the list for the civil rehabilitation?

Well, the OP asked about the possibility of the public key being shared by two different private key owners.  The private key is 2^256 long and is the only "random" that you'll see in bitcoin.  Two different private key can generate the same public key that is 2^128 long.  That public key is not random, it's generated through an algorithm based on the private key.  The odds of a single public key being shared by two different wallets is 1 / 2^128.  Seems insignificant right.  But the birthday problem shows us that a clash between two seemingly very unlikely events become exponentially likely when we add participants.  In other words, the more bitcoin users there are, and the more transactions we do, the more likely we are to have a public key clash.

Apart from the private key generation, nothing is random in bitcoin.  It's all algorithm and hashing which are both deterministic.

A private key generates the public key.  Nothing prevents 2 different private keys from generating the same public key.  It's just very unlikely.
