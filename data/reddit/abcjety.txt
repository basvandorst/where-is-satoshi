wBTCB atms overcharge you way too much, at least in Prague. They also dont display prices until you have put in money. And if you want to cancel the order after seeing how high their fees are, you cant get your money back, you get a voucher that you can spend in their atms, or can get cash for it at their offices. Seems a bit scammy. Use General Bytes atms if in Prague. But i suppose those are better priced generally anywhere.

Where exactly did he call him an idiot?

Jesus what a snowflake. Where was his response hostile?
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:55:14
Calling someone naive isnt the same as calling someone an idiot, it refers to two different behaviours or states of minds. I would think at least.
'he could be nicer, thats literally what ive said.' Well you said hes hostile. I think we are just arguing about words now. I've actually just looked up whats the definition of hostile, and I had a different understanding of it. I thought being hostile is actively trying to cause harm, but apparently it doesnt necessarily mean that. Lets just say, I think if you have actually had written, 'hey man just be nicer', people wouldnt have misunderstood it. Also, not every conversation should be like two british posh gentlemen talking to each other, and people should be able to talk to others with different temperaments and personalities, people who go straight to the point without trying to not hurt feelings. Just look at the content of what others say or write without taking it personally.
Also, I dont get the downvotes either..

Whats so hard or peculiar about hodling 0.5 btc through a 60% drop?
If you think there is something about it, you still dont get the big picture and long term.

By calling the regulators and every possibly relevant government agency on them. Technically, they are not wrong, just assholes. Enough for me to make a note for myself, if i ever use atms in germany, make sure its not one of theirs.

im asking why he thinks Peter Thiel is a piece of shit. Then I had a look at his profile, and realized he fanatically hates trump. So I suppose thats why he hates peter thiel too, because he has supported the president since the beginning

Yes it is. What makes you think your work is worth more and should be taxed less than the most effective hard working and successful people? The fact that there are evil creeps who happen to be also rich, is not a problem with the capitalist system, its a moral and legal issue. The fact that the millitary machine of the usa is an awful problem, but no one who would dare to tackle it gets into a position to be able to actually do something about it, is also a differemt problem. There has to be seperations of powers thats for sure. But that also has nothing to do with the fact that this slippery slope has been tried so many times, and the results are clear

it might not be an 'original thought', but its true. whats exactly stopping anyone with a laptop from stopping being poor? can you provide a link/source for the wealth generation from earning vs inheritance statistics? i d quite like to read it, but im not really finding anything
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:42:37
Do you not realise that was the slogan of literally every communist system..? We are not against the good people, only the evil rich guys. How stupid can you guys get to still fall for it, after more than 100 years of evidence and countless examples. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

Bernie: "We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. And that brings in new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority, I hope, that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the United States of America."
So now he wants constitution changes, and to force out judges, and murder babies. Need any more proof that hes a crazed dictator wannabe?
 Usually the generation that inherits wealth squanders most of its worth if they dont have the ethics and principles that made their parents have the money. Sooner or later. And life is not fair, clearly, but thats still not an argument for taxing all the rich people. But everyone has the chance to change his life for better. Stop being poor is actually an awfully good advice. Yes the tax system is clearly not working right, companies can easily evade tax, and there are government subsidies. Which is actually against every capitalist and free market principle, so im not really getting your point here. Effectiveness and hard work play a role in getting rich by yourself, if you seriously need a debate to understand that, thats really weird.

How is this a lie by right wing media...?
Maybe it's the best in this century, but definitely not true to the fundamentals of the funding fathers. The us has started going downhill right around the turn of the 20th century, around when the monetary system was given imto the hands of bankers. Yes the millitary complex and its importance is quite disgusting. Especially how now they use even monetary systems for their own little wars, like in the case of iran

Well you know, your argument is that my argument is ironically super cool, (so nothing), my argument is literally hundreds of years of scientific and experimental proof.
I didnt say the ussr wasnt real socialism. What im and this meme is saying that there is no other socialism. Whatever way you try to not end up in the same mess as every socialist country did, those efforts are futile, if you mess with the basis of a social system that much unnaturally as socialism does, it will unevitably end up in the same murderous mess as each and every socialist country through history did

I wouldnt say it's best centralized, probably the more decentralized and with a fractal structure the better. And of course merit based. It just happens that people with different temperaments, views, and thinking, fight differently, if at all, for various authorities, so they get sorted into different pyramids.

Have you seriously read nothing about a company you are giving tens of thousands of dollars of your money to? If in spite of all the info available, you still want to use them, you kinda deserve every problem and lost funds you encounter with them.

Your system is detoriating not because capitalism wouldnt work. It's happening because it is getting farther and farther from capitalism. Tens of thousands of regulations, more and more centralized power and corruption, uncontrollable illegal immigration, and less and less rights, and less and less sensible opposition. All the democratic nominees literally want to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants. Lets not even go there. I kinda agree, we should be careful not to be over-rigid and stuck in place with ideas. But there are some ideas which go against fundamental things, and there is no way to dress it up in a way that would work. Almost everyone has different ideas of socialism and communism, everyone has his little things that they concentrate on and can articulate and argue for better. Im all for helping people, when it actually helps them, and im all for equal opportunity and rights for everyone. But I think that's the line where the idea 'equal' should end in political debates. Why would a moneyless society make sense? How would we communicate worth? Why is it better if there is no measure of it? You do realize that people would just invent some measure of it anyway.. not all of us are motivated enough, some not at all, just by helping others and the greater good. If there is no 'useful feedback from society' (aka money) for someone's works and accomplishments, he will just not do it, or form an underground society

What makes you think giving free money to africans is a good cause, or would help with anything? They havent been able to form functional societies for tens of thousands of years. Why would some free gibs help anything
