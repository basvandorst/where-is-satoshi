Without realizing it, you just gave back plenty to society.  Thank you for a truly wonderful post.

I agree.  Getting out after making enough money to help achieve something you define as great in your life is the ultimate goal.  If an investment can eliminate any major financial stress, well, that is the moon for most of us.  I’m glad he didn’t get greedy and achieved his goal.  I hope to be there one day...

I don’t mess with my 401k.  I put as much ‘disposable’ monthly income into Bitcoin as possible.   Just my approach.

Jamie Dimon's daughter just bought a new Range Rover. The establishment is protecting their gravy train.

He deserves to get in on the fun with you, so I would do it!  Just not to the point where you will feel horrible if it doesn’t work out for him.  They always say, ‘don’t invest more than you can afford to lose’.  In my opinion, this is even more true with family members.

Where’s Jamie Dimon?  He’s probably buying a ton of BTC for his ‘daughter’.  Of course, Jamie wouldn’t be buying it for himself, right???

Makes sense.  Thanks.

I wouldn’t doubt it.  It’s moving day today.  Existing crypto money is moving out of everything else and into BTC.  Amazing what it can pull off when it wants to.
