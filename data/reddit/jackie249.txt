But if someone is exchanging his euros for Bitcoin now, how will he use them AT THIS INSTANT? He needs the money to eat .. which is a domestic option .. but no local businesses accept Bitcoin. So what does one do in such a scenario?

you are stupid! Doesn't consider more than 10% as a rise ...

and what about the lower middle class??? there is a big section of the Greek society which is wondering if they will have a meal tomorrow or not ... how will they benefit from buying Bitcoins given that no business accepts Bitcoin?

But what about now??? Preservation is long term ... they need to eat now
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:45:09
But we know that the first expense of Greeks will be food ... how will they spend on food if no restaurants or local markets accept Bitcoin??

Oh Halsey ...

I also hope they don't die on the streets ... because if the grexit does happen and the greek government gets late in accepting Bitcoin ... we cannot say for sure what we will see in the future ...

I am just saying because if governments continue to print more of fiat currencies, consumers will be unintentionally forced to use more of them. Also, I think that the efforts are more on the blockchain technology and not Bitcoin.

Not consistently! But yes, 5-6 out of 10 times. And 7 is really good in the financial markets.
