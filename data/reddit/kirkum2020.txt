Before they started doing it, the same people were touting that Windows was about to die to those same operating systems, because they were more user friendly, without realising it was that data that had made them so intuitive.
Damned if they do, damned if they don't.

You're irritated that people use software that doesn't personally suit you and your needs?
Maybe you need absolute privacy, all of the time.  Most people don't though.  There's no big secrets in my Steam library or Netflix watch list ffs.
And when I do need security, it's not exactly hard to come by.

With a population that small and internet savvy, with polls like this one... I think they're terrified something like bitcoin could organically replace the Krona with frightening speed.
It would be very scary to be in power if something like this went down.  Interesting experiment if it did though.

Yup.  I'm not a religious bitcoiner at all.
I just think the Icelanders would be the type to adopt it en-masse if it started snowballing.  And I didn't say that would be a good thing.

I clicked on a few faucets and watched some ads a few times over a couple of days before forgetting about it.
I dug that old drive out of the attic when bc pulled that first thousand-dollar moonshot.  It bought me a couple of years on a good VPN and an ounce of insanely strong weed, so I'm actually pretty good with 'missing out'.

Marc Almond is practically a household name in the UK.  Tainted Love still gets lots of airtime.

Bitcoin would be for a tiny minority of assholes if we all refused to share knowledge with those asking for it.

While we're on the subject, anybody been to Digg in the last couple of years?  The moment all those people deserted Digg for Reddit, Digg got reasonably good again, at least content wise.  The front-page here is often filled with Digg reposts.

Their offers are far better than places like Cash Generator and they tend to know what they're buying too.  It's great for people like me: I've had bad experiences investing so often that I've always had doubts about paying cash for Bitcoin but I'll gladly clear out all my old junk for some.

The circlejerk is strong in here today.  Nothing new but it's a shame your comment's on the bottom of the page.
Google is better, absolutely, but it's either arrogance or stupidity keeping them from copying some of the shinier elements in Bing.  Everybody uses Google's and others best ideas all the time, it's how things are supposed to work now.

It's brilliant but some of the recommended searches turn my stomach... the world is full of sickos according to Bing.
That said, couldn't live without the preview; nothing pisses me off more than finding out the video doesn't have sound!

And what kind of economics professor would see bitcoin as anything less than an interesting experiment?  He also seems to think that other currencies are still backed by precious metals.
Don't think you've wasted your time though.  I've learned a couple of things from your thoughtful replies if nothing else.  Thanks.

It even states that it will eventually follow suit when the EU decides how it moves forward on the VAT issue.

It's been a standard with every account I've ever held in the UK.  I should imagine it's much the same throughout Europe but, unlike you, I wouldn't like to make such an uninformed statement.

I just looked and it's not posted anywhere.  I've guessed elsewhere in the thread that it's lighthearted and now I'm pretty sure the upvotes are organic.  Top post at srd currently, and probably the inspiration for this one is

I'd say it's the other way round.  We've seen BTC prices swing more in the in a few days than some currencies do in decades.
Edit: I'm a thicko and mildly sleepy.  Ignore everything I say.

There may be a few but some of us can take a joke.  This is probably due to the angry and ironic "dogecoin cultists" post from last night.  It's at the top of atm.

Or just disable the subreddit style.

If we're playing by the rules, don't vote over there at all.  Not going there sounds like the best option though.

Hypocritical for offering a private bet while operating his business under the law?

Except trolling in plain sight, when they're under investigation and universally loathed, isn't something people tend to do.
This looks like some extreme attention deficit thing.

Well, they don't officially accept them but you can get a fair few into those deposit boxes before you get chased out.

In your free market, the monopoly simply buys its competitor or takes the hit and undercuts them till they go out of business.  Hell, that happens all the time already.

I'm gonna take a single box just to give it a try and throw a bit of support their way but, unless it's incredible, I can't afford to subscribe.  Here in blighty, that 2 month box would be lucky to see a single person through a fortnight.

I'd be more inclined to believe it if it said the 5GH/s miner was still delayed in 2025.

Exactly.  If I know enough to warrant buying a rig then I'll already have a wallet and the knowledge of how to purchase the bitcoin I need for it.

The fact that the number of available products tripled suggests that at least two thirds of them are scams.  I know they'll get filtered out soon but that's pretty sad.
