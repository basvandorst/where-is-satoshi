Its called profit taking. Standard in any market.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:39:02

Don't know what to believe the last couple days lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:28
Twitter is just as bad. All social media and news in general are meant to inject fear into markets.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:01:20

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:03
Quality analysis.
Here is my analysis: It could go up or down from here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:31
Another panic is what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:00:37
Was pretty hard to lose with bitcoin and most altcoins I feel like
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:05:33
Go for more technical analysis.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:06:54
too early to buy the dip IMHO, gonna wait it out a bit more
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:04:27
Or we could just protest and close it completely. The amount of drama they caused is stupid.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:34:20
shots fired at the stock bag hodler

@_date: 2018-03-11 15:13:03
Fuck thats sad. Most of these exchanges charge thousands to list on their exchange too.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:37:39
I ran out of money buying the dip at 13,000
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:14:46
BTC at 20k was a bit ridiculous, I remember being like wtf is going on.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:24:55
