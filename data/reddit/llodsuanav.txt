On 9/10/2001, the Department of Defense announced it could not account for $2,300,000,000,000.  And two days later no one even cared anymore.  When you look at the scale of money across the global economy, $21,000,000,000,000 is not really that extreme.

He's referring to the recent revelation by Michael Lewis about High Frequency Trading.

It doesn't equal anti-authority on a personal, conceptual level.  Just like if you have dollars it doesn't equate to a personal opinion on authority.  But when you are looking at Bitcoin as a whole, at it's properties and system of operation, then it does equal anti-authority.

You're putting to much thought into this.  She described the anarchistic and decentralized properties of bitcoin.  Disagreeing with her presentation doesn't take anything away from what she said, or the direction that bitcoin is going.

Interesting perspective about the people at the top.  I see them more as being so arrogant with power and money that they feel they can dictate bitcoins future.  
As for voting, that can never be given back to the people until citizens united is overturned, or until bitcoin replaces the dollar.  And I'm not sure what chance either of those have.
But yes, Tech always wins, and our lifetime is seeing quite dynamic shift.

Bitcoin is political though.  Money means everything in politics, and the most substantial effects of politics is on money.  They are inherently connected.  It's utterly naive to pretend they are not.

Need to explain Bitcoin features in more detail providing examples.  Short and sweet doesn't cut it when describing bitcoin.  People need to know how the tech works and how they can access and use it.  
Also, the royal blue font doesn't match the rest of the color scheme.  Thanks for the site!

When bitcoin reaches such an advantageous position, it will be more worth your while to just keep and spend your bitcoin.  So your original purpose is meaningless from the start.

I really hope people in the bitcoin community aren't going to comply with that absurdity. The whole point of bitcoin was to avoid the centralized bureaucracy.  The government is just coercing us with fear of being imprisoned to steal our money.  It's really uncompliable from a moral standpoint.

It makes sense that the US government would implement this.  A currency with more than the potential to rival and overtake the US dollar in the next decade is a threat.  And the easiest way to counteract it right now is to try and integrate it into the current system.  It won't work.
But it's hard for me to imagine that there are bitcoiner's out there who have no problem complying with this statute.  The point of bitcoin is to create a truly free market devoid of this type of centralization.  From a moral standpoint, the government is using the fear of imprisonment to steal a percentage of our free market capital.  We have to stand together and say 'No'.  As someone already mentioned, they already get their fair share from me.

You're being a silly man and you're misinterpreting her use of 'basic bitch'.  She not calling people who have no idea what Bitcoin is basic bitches.  Infact, she spends the first minute of the video describing exactly who she is defining.  And the people she is defining, are clearly people who stereotype and formulate wrongful conclusions about the basis of bitcoin.  That's it.  That's all she is using that term for.  
But I agree with you.  I think we should change the term.  From now on, people who attack Bitcoin and stereotype if without having a fundamental understanding of how it works, will no longer be called 'Basic Bitches'!  From now on, we will call them, '**Classic Cunts**'!  
Sorry if ambiguous language hurts your feelings.

Even if it doesn't overtake the dollar, it will continue to grow on it's current course causing the same response.  
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:35:10
Everyone on here is taking this to literal.  It's just a video pointing out facts about bitcoin's decentralized properties.  You can bitch all you want about her rhetoric, but the properties of bitcoin aren't going to change.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:09:32
That is a good point.  But even concluding that bitcoin won't be able to overtake any fiat currency for years to come, it will still pose a threat as it continues to grow and gain more and more momentum.  I have the feeling it make some important people worried.

This all a response to a giant sell off in the Chinese market.  In 2-3 days buy.  And watch it soar.  Pretty easy to understand what's going on.  Definitely not the end of crypto.

Why would you actually report to the IRS?
Edit.  Ah.  I see the facetiousness now.
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:16:17
Exactly this.  In the age of deception, assumptions are unacceptable, and diligence is required to have any modicum of understanding this reality.

In my honest opinion, Coinbase is about to crash and burn.  The account management and processing demands since they introduced Shift have put a huge stress on them.  Now add in an IRS audit and the soaring BTC price, this place is done.  Looks like I'm only going to lose out on about .25 BTC, I feel sorry for those with larger losses.

Coinbase death.  Spend what you have with a Shift card if you can't withdraw.  Otherwise your BTC are going to be void.
