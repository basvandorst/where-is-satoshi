He said the arithmetic chart would look like an exponential. That's the curve he drew on the board.
He then introduced the logarithmic chart.

On a deeper hunt for fractals in Bitcoin, I found [this Medium post]( from January this year, here's [the r-bitcoin discussion]( 
TL;DR: Article says we're at the peak of a high, before a few year dip, then 2020 should see ~$33k. 
That could be how the market works out, but with the mainstream getting into it, any or every move up or down could be amplified.  At least, that's how I FEEL... But people felt this exact same way before, in the middle of being in the fractals I'm saying have been predictable.  Maybe the math will work regardless of our feelings.

Bitcoin sales pretty much only happen on the weekend. Last weekend sale was on Nov 11-12 for $6500 after having hit $7500 for the first time earlier that week.
I don't think we'll see another sale until the price flatens out for a couple days though, which, could be a good while.
Imagine all the weak hands in the market now though. Any dip could be a pretty major one.

Take a look at the BTC price for the year. Can you see a point on the graph where you can say "I'd regret buying if I'd bought in at that point"?
Take a look at the BTC price for last year and do the same.
I bought in at the $1000 peak in 2013, and thought I'd wasted my money shortly after that. This past year though, with so many countries cracking down on their own currencies, I really believe in this thing.  
If you look at the graph for the next year, or the year after that, I don't think you'll see many points where you'd have regret from buying in. Not for long, anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:31:41
I bought in when BTC reached its crazy peak at $1000 back a few years ago.  I only put in a couple installments of $50.  It crashed shorlty after, but it's paid off in the long run.   HODL seems a pretty decent strat from any starting point

A 50% dip still only takes us back to Thanksgiving's prices. This is insane. I was expecting a dip at $10k to get back to 7-8k, but it kept. on. going.   I sold a little bit at 11.5k, but bought back in 30 or so hours later, once I saw that this train aint stopping no time soon.

Forking is when you change the rules to fix a problem. 
Sometimes your changes are backwards compatible with the old rules, resulting is a soft fork, where people running the old software will still be able to go on with the rules changing.  
Sometimes your rules would cause anyone running the old software to invalidate blocks mined by the new rules, which is a hard fork. Anyone wanting to play by the new rules will need to use new software to see the chain as valid.
Bitcoin Cash hard forked, increasing the block size to 8mb, and changing some mining difficulty rules, because they believed increasing the block size is a better way of scaling than implementing something like SegWit.
SegWit was a soft fork change that enables more transactions per block. 
Bitcoin Gold is a hardfork that... I don't know if they're changing the rules at all, but they're pre-mining a bunch of coins so that they can "pay the developers" once trading opens up.  That's how I understand it at least. Just plain not beneficial, likely a moneygrab.
SegWit 2X will be a hard fork that increases the block size from 1mb to 2mb, and changes the project repository from 'bitcoin' to 'btc1'. Basically kicking the current developers off the project, and changing control of Bitcoin.  A major consideration in this fork is that there is no replay protection like there was in Bitcoin Cash.  This means that the chains can not exist safely at the same time. One of them will have to die, and likely (I think) on day 1.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:29:31
If there were any sort of approval, forget even consensus, from the community about this project, these small, obvious errors would have been fixed before the first release.  
This shows clearly that btc1 was a coup attempt from NYA signers.  Good on the community for getting that 4mb block weight and enabling an easier Layer2 and 3 while resisting the overthrow.

@_date: 2017-11-17 19:46:52
Load up some money onto an exchange like GDAX, put a limit order in for ~8% less than current market value, and you might strike within the week.  If you find a dip that goes low enough for you in the meantime, you can cancel the first order and buy right then.
Dips are getting rarer and shallower though, I wouldn't wait too long for that dip.

It would be a 51% attack against the BCH blockchain specifically. If the BCH network has a total hash power of say 500P(peta)H/s ([which it's actually below right now]( a mining pool with that power or above could come in and create blocks with false transactions. 
BTC currently has a total network [hashrate of 9.5E(exa)H/s]( If 10% of the BTC network up and decides to start mining false BCH blocks, they can. The network will recognize them as completely valid blocks.
A 51% attack for all cryptocurrencies would require either A) Over half of all miners in all chains going rogue or B) Some crazy amount of brand new mining datacenters, totaling over 100% of the current global hashrate.  Neither of those are likely to happen in the current ecosystem.
Taking down just one blockchain with less than 7% of the total BTC network, though? There are [6 or 7 pools]( that could bone BCH if they really wanted too.

Did Coinbase change their mind? I was sure they said they'd only be selling 2X.
They are still on Bitcoin.org's bad guy list.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:50:59
This has been my big concern. Every thread I've seen is how horrible 2X will be, or poor defenses for 2X, it just looks like a bad idea.  Miners have been flagging NYA at well over 90%, with only random empty blocks and Slushpool not flagging.  
The overwhelming confidence that 2X would fail seemed like some sort of cognitive dissonance throughout If just a few more miners fall off this month, it looks like the NO2X movement will really win out.  Without a majority of miner support though, I don't know how anyone could be confident that 1X would win, or even keep surviving, after the split.

It's a fork that'll have no controversy though, or so I've been led to believe. They're so confident with the lack of controversy, that they're really wanting to call it an Upgrade or Update, which I think will just introduce these terms as possible propaganda words in the future, when there IS a contentious fork off BCH.

Coinbase isn't the end all, be all of fiat to crypto exchange. [Here's a list]( of exchanges, over 15 of which both aren't GDAX or Coinbase, and support USD-&gt;BTC exchange.  
Bitfinex and Bitstamp currently have higher trading volumes than GDAX, too.

I don't think  we'll have that kind of action until the Lightning network is up. Enabling extremely fast, cheap transactions that can scale Bitcoin an order of magnitude or so would be such a boon to adoption, and by extension, value.

So I guess it just took that futures market to convince them that their hashpower would be best rewarded on the more valuable coin. 
This is great.  Now we know that the NYA is nothing but a "well I guess we'll do this as long it's the best thing for us" promise. 
~~What's that?~~ S2X's ticket on Bitfinex. Got it.  So this futures market is legitimate trade?  I can cash out my S2Xcoin before the split?

Didn't BCH only have ~15% of the hashing power?  IIRC: Everyone was saying the chain would die immediately with so little power.
Edit:  Yeah, the [Fork.lol]( monitor shows less than [1/10 the hashpower for BCH]( or less from the beginning of Aug through the 19th.

Wow. Much bullish. Many spooky.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:58:07
Honor isn't why either of them switched. 
Slush allows their users to vote how they want their hash power spent, and it's about 1/3 Core, 1/2 Majority Decides, 1/6 NYA. So the winning votes are, well, winning that pool.  
After the futures market on Bitfinex opened up, it was obvious what the more valuable coin will be. F2Pool switched after that.  I don't know what internal processes went on, if there's voting or not, but the greedy thing to do is to put your mining power where the money is.
This isn't to dis any miner for any position they take, in fact this is how Bitcoin is supposed to work in the first place. Everyone looks out for themselves, nobody trust anybody, everyone verify, and everything keeps working.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:08:59
