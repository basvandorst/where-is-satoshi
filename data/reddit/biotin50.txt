OP has already added this in the update, but this is critical whether you had a wallet password or not. As mentioned, if you had a fairly decent wallet password set, then the attacker could probably get the address/transaction info from your wallet and change your Electrum settings, which is still pretty dangerous. The developer hasn't released detailed info yet but please follow OP's instructions until we get more info from the developer.

Hi last week I launched Cointabb and I'm looking for ~~some~~ more feedback. The big difference between CMC and Cointabb is that the latter is simpler and cleaner and has some cool features that I feel CMC lacks. Here is a small list of some of the improvements:
* Pages are fast, clean, and easy to read/scan on any device
* The favorite/bookmark feature lets you track coins without requiring login or sign up
* The trending page shows you coins/tokens that are doing well over the last 24 hours
* The filtering feature lets you set custom parameters to find promising coins/tokens etc...
* Platform pages let you view/search/filter tokens on platforms
* The site offers a consistent and clean night mode version for all devices
And a few more things you'll find as you explore the site. Each page also links to CoinMarketCap page so you can be able to use both sites at the same time. Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Just fixed it. It should be working now. I'll also add an option to filter out empty values.

Thanks for the feedback! Just implemented the search functionality. You can test it here:

Good feedback, will make it more clear.

Awesome feedback. Just updated the night mode theme along with your suggestions. Let me know if it's better.

Hah, didn't even notice it. Nice! Although I think **Dec 17, 2017** would be more readable than **2017.12.17** :)

Congrats on the launch. That looks really awesome! One feedback I'd give is you should change the Time column to show the exact date instead of relative time. I think it would be easier to understand in that format because I want to know *exactly when* BTC reached its ATH, etc...

The data is from CMC, it's mentioned clearly in multiple places :)
