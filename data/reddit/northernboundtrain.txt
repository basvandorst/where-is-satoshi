Do you mean in terms of transaction fees and rewards? No, because even if they were selected in a lottery, they would not be participating in either proposing blocks or validating those blocks.

I have questions, if someone can answer them. 1) So how far in the future is the "flag day" for turning on SegWit via the UASF? 2) How is the software activated? 3) Does the software have to be written into Bitcoin Core? I need help with the fuzzy little details. Thanks!

You can't switch out the consensus algorithm of bitcoin. It is simply not possible. And why would you want to? Technology evolves and improves over time, so new solutions will be introduced. But that doesn't mean bitcoin can't exist side by side with those.

I meant to reply to a different person. Thank you for the clarification.

Read the white paper. They key is the random selection of players using a self run lottery and a novel version of BA that runs on permissionless systems. Traditional BFT only runs on permissioned systems.

Thanks. Good to know.

No, bitcoin only has about 6,000 full nodes. Also, forks are not an important part of decentralized architecture. They are an unfortunate byproduct of bitcoin's PoW.

It is a proof of stake system. Only coin holders are selected in the lottery, based on the fraction of coins they hold in the system. So if one public key has 1M coins, has the same chance of getting picked in lottery as if they had 1M keys with 1 coin each. Clear?

As xor_rotate explained, algorand is at the moment still a theoretic approach that only exists on paper. Micali has thought through everything and included proofs, but the code has yet to be written.

Yes, because to scale to massive levels, you cannot run consensus with all the players. You need to choose some sort of subset. But it is how he does that, which is interesting.

Surely you jest

where should we move them?

What about a coinbase wallet?

So SegWit2x includes BIP91?

Non-segwit hard fork w/ 8MB blocks
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:45:49
Not hashing power. They are not really signalling for segwit2x. they are using coinbase tagging, which does not actually do anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:22:55
Yes, between lock in and activation.

yeah, i normally respect him, but i found his comments here weird. Mining chips in toasters? I don't think so. Now I'm going to think twice about everything he says. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:44:59
Gave them a crash course

If you don't have something intelligent to say about a story, then don't bother.
