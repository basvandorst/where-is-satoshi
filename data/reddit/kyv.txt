Not sure if you're bullshitting or know fuck-all about the theme of the subreddit...

Because sufaq is Satoshi.

I'd just like to point out that I'm not hitting out at techies (despite OP hitting out at financiers) and that I totally see the value in the tech industry. It actually amazes me how little technology / tech ability is present in some financial services firms and makes me glad to be a 'jack of all trades' in the tech-finance respect. Myself, I would almost definitely be in tech if it weren't beneficial under my circumstances to be more knowledgable in the world of money.
Regards, all.

Want to set up a new version that does just this?

Point. Relatively, it has I guess.

Suppose it takes 3 seconds to spot, bend over and pick up a penny and stand up again and this process repeats itself for 8 hours a day. You'd make more working than though 'penny picking' (if you make more than $12/hr) so then you have to ask yourself what the heck was the point in picking that penny up?

You want some advice? Rid yourself of all the debt you can, as soon as you can.
Sell as much as you need to that you can cover your mortgage. If it irks you that much, tell your wife she still must pull in x-amount per year so you're in a better position. Then if BTC drops you can put that back in. If it rises, big whoop. You made some money, don't be greedy. Greed eventually causes irrational behaviour -&gt; failure.
But believe when I say that NOT being in debt is SO freeing and your QOL should increase some what. Think about it - excluding food/utils, everything you earn is PROFIT!

Stop being such a smug cunt, these exchanges weren't run by bankers/financiers, they were run by techies =&gt; they failed.
The "real life" financial exchanges close and are not 24-7 for a reason. Most bad news is released at 4.30PM on a Friday for a reason. People are irrational and emotional, they act based on fear and greed (among other things) and as such people are swept up during a period of irrational exuberance and body slammed to the floor once a few people realise what's happening/take profits. I'm not saying the [Bitcoin] exchanges shouldn't be 24-7. Personally I enjoy it because it's more freeing. As a Brit, it's easier to trade on the NYSE during the evenings when I can focus than during the day when I am doing whatever.
The cause of the recent bubble? Not financiers. They're having enough fun with equities and the current Euro/Yen situation (I use this loosely) to care about something like Bitcoin. The bubble was caused by over-hype from the media and over-demand from [idiotic?irrational?] naïve folks not in finance (eg young techies, etc) who heard the hype, saw the price increase and thought "WELL FUCK ME, IF IT'S GONE UP SO MUCH IT CAN ONLY GO UP".
Analysts make the same mistakes too, all the time, it's common and is a psychological, human trait. Those who learn self control of their emotions through teaching and raw experience are those who are successful. You can bet your arse that Warren Buffet etc didn't consider Bitcoin an investment. Maybe a gamble. Probably didn't really look at it.
*I say all this without even touching the economics of it, because that's not important for this debate.*
I also must stress that there are some aspects of tech that *may* not be where they are today were it not for finance and big-money. eg HFT -&gt; increased research into latency times and the like, such as development of a microwave relay from Chicago to NY that is ~70% reliable (because it wont work in rain. They justify it well, do some research)
EDIT2// I re-read it, I have added [Bitcoin] in the 2nd para because those are the exchanges I was referring to. In the City or on Wall Street there is a period over night that the exchanges are closed because traders are human and humans need a bit of R&amp;R.

Why were this guy down voted?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:29:45
Wow... couldn't you see it had risen far too fast? Nothing that jumps 40%+ in a day doesn't have a correction soon after. I've seen AIM stocks shoot up 800% and more in a couple of hours and correct to 600% or whatever their 'real' value may be.

But look at WHY this happens. AUS economy has been on the up.

I'm not going to fact check it, but if that's true, touché. 
But I wouldn't really class bitcoin as a 'proper currency' yet (eg it's like the Bristol pound or whatever and not like Yen etc), I'm too tired to go in depth but I'm sure you'd agree?
