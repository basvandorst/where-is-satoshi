The point is targeting for info. Regardless if is how to gain access to your exchange account or where you may possibly keep your seed words safe.
@_date: 2019-07-07 09:58:58
You’re missing the whole point.
Don’t disclose holdings because it’s one more piece of information for you to get impersonated and stolen.
It starts with how much you hold, then a subtle where do you usually trade and a very clever “how much percentage of your portfolio do you usually trade”
To reset your account on many exchanges this answers would be sufficient since you know the possible or close amount of funds he holds on that account - that’s one of the questions.
Then, a subtle answer of how do you buy bitcoin because you’re looking to compare fees, and it’s an easy road to find where you live, therefore your location. 
What I mean is, it’s not about knowing that info, but you become a target. And many subtle and simple questions lead to bigger answers than many may realize.
So don’t want to become a target and playing a losing game? Don’t disclose your holdings ;)

I personally use bitstamp to buy it and send it over to my address.
Coinbase is also an option, but the choice of one or another, or even a third one largely depends on where you live I’d say.
But has the other redditor said, the sidebar has info in that regard that can easily help you out. Just don’t overpay in fees (my only point in regards to coinbase, and to my belief ‘bitstamp is cheaper)  and you’ll do well!

Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.
Don’t ask others on public forums what to buy, buy the king BTC then take advice with cautious approach. -&gt; even this one, btc can tank before rising, I have no idea what will happen to btc next, neither anyone does
Start small. Btc isn’t going magically doing a 1000000000%, you can perfectly do incremental buys and feel cool about observing, you can buy almost whichever amount of usd in bitcoin you want, don’t go all in and watch it move.
We’re the younger crowd who is able to watch all of this happen, but expect volatility and many altcoins to die, this isn’t all roses. In the end, regardless of time, we will be part of something huge

You’re right, Bitcoin should only be used when you’re ok with beeing scammed, you’re absolutely right and I’m sorry for thinking bitcoin could actually become the currency of choice.


This makes absolute no sense, are you even reading yourself? Saying this after ‘why use bitcoin then?’
Geez...you really need to open those eyes into reality. No one is using bitcoin because it’s too fking hard and easy to get scammed. UX/UI needs to be improved, and it needs to be reliable to use, otherwise, you’ll always be stuck in your batcave yelling burn fiat. Wake up caveman.

@_date: 2018-11-29 13:45:54
I was replicating what you said, don’t turn that on me. I fking obviously do not agree with that, it’s the fking whole point of my argument
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:13:40
Inb4, thanks on playing the devil’s advocate, missed an healthy non-fork discussion, with that said, imo:


Agreed, an offer they can’t refuse is an offer they can choose.For it to be accepted, they need to be able to choose how to settle : FIAT or BTC for example. Someone needs to do the job all between, leaving the merchant with a choice only. Everything remains normal on their side.


For now is Fiat, in their bank account. Again, someone must do the job all between, for them is just another day. And, the more we actually use crypto, maybe one day BTC is more stable than USD for example (I believe in this btw, but it will take time), for now, answer is fiat.


Even in 2018 where we at, it’s a pain to manage BTC if you have a business or buying with it. UX/UI hasn’t been fully addressed, for either sides. And, tons of ‘merchants’ I seriously doubt it was that big of a ‘number’, btc is much more widely known now than it was before, and it isn’t available in 1% of merchants worldwide probably. (Is there any reliable source of places/websites you can buy with btc?)
@_date: 2018-11-30 09:38:03
Something on this market must be doing something bad to you mate.
They have, ive been invested since ico last year, so I know they do. So feel free to provide proof of the contrary. And since we’re talking about a payment gateway that uses crypto, partners that actually hold a use case are bad for cryptos, and therefore promotion? Should I send you a PM about what projects are you invested in meaning the only ones that can be talked about? I’m not even understanding that stance.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:21:23
Me too, happy holding

Physics guy, this.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:45:25
Just a update on your catch:
For Bitcoin to be adopted, merchants need the stability. In order for it to be used by buyers, it needs to be accessible and spendable in a matter of minutes, through your mobile phone. Companies are doing it, and one is going live Q1 next year, I think we need someone trustworthy to address those two issues, and cryptos can finally be free to be used. Call me crazy, but I believe it.
@_date: 2018-11-29 10:35:55
Shitbtc that should the name
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:18:49
Funny enough you speak highly about Satoshi whitepaper, but have you read it?
I won’t paste you the whitepaper because you clearly can’t read it (it mentions a 3rd party escrow), so I’ll leave this thread where satoshi himself speaks of escrow:
Without fiat gateway, there will be no adoption, BTC will remain in the cave it has been for so many years. First you make it useful, then it can have value, and there will be a time when bitcoin will be more stable than fiat, and the flip was made.
And instead of calling BS shill, we are all here for a reason, and to me, this is one of the ways adoption will be reach, or do you believe BTC is at a stage where you could actually use it like fiat?
You buy online and the item doesn’t arrive, you contact support and they say “bad luck”, who is going to use, and for how long? i would fucking use fiat all day long just as I’ve been doing it. Btc can’t be a store of value only, it needs to be used.
I love BTC, it got me into crypto, but you need to open those eyes for the reality.

Upvoting this. The wisest decisions are your own, you’ll sleep a lot better at night.
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:25:38
They have that option, the choice to how and when the settlements occur it’s on the merchants side. If you want all in btc, go for it
Edit: to add that they have on the roadmap to add a stable coin, maybe you’d prefer that one and then do your buyings on the side. Their Platform is very complete in terms of options

I see UTRUST very well placed there tbh, I actually invested in a payment processor just because I feel it makes all sense, buyer and seller protection and such is needed for adoption on e-commerce.  
In order for the average joe to use our beloved bitcoin, they need it to be an easy and regular experience that they're used to, I believe Utrust\\utk is nailing it

@_date: 2018-12-05 09:42:38
I don’t understand what’s the problem with that. As long as the currency isn’t inflated or printed on whoever wishes to do, what’s the problem of storing it under someone else’s as long as they are audited and legit? I’ve been doing that for my life and let’s be honest, it has worked out pretty well, my only concern with fiat is that it will be worthless not where I have it. Not everyone wants all the power in its hands, it’s a lot easier not to have it, and so far I had zero problems with that. But the economy behind fiat, that’s my problem.

By all the crypto sphere being more available and providing use cases for more people to start understanding the benefits, then the crowd turns to crypto, and everyone and their moms takes bitcoin into another run where everyone forgets when they bought and they scream * 1 billion BTC’!(*
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:50:25
Those people I said that slowly start to benefit from it just need the crypto sphere and all the projects in it to actually fullfil their promises made at ico and provide a easy door to enter, where people are led by the benefits and not the tech in itself, because unfortunately the masses won’t care about it, only that it’s cool and they win something out of it (somehow sad but true). That’s why cherry picking before the next run, whenever it comes, it’s really important

They aren’t. But there are also solutions beeing developed for that particular problem. Buyer protection has to be through a centralized trust party, there’s no way around it as it is. (even Satoshi mentioned it). Utrust for example is doing it, but they allow external wallets to be used (they shown respect to the decentralized aspect and those of us who like to be in charge of our money, so I liked their solution). By using their gateway, you’re guaranteed to have buyer protection, and I wouldn’t mind incur in a kyc to have my money back if there was the need, so I’m relaxed in regards to crypto usability since i saw their product. I won’t be afraid of using BTC to buy online anymore, just waiting for the launch and I’ll start to fiat-&gt; btc everything i intend to spend online that month (their own wallet is beeing worked on to offer a very simple UX and fiat gateway on mobile), and do my part towards adoption. I’m already telling riot games and epic games on every purchase that i want to start using btc next year, buying those juicy overpriced pixels with ma Btc will be a glorious day, one day.

Yes, because value =/ from price, in case you didn’t realize. The tech remains and wasn’t changed, so everything will go back to its place, once the smoke clears.
