I've always thought that, what if Bitcoin is alive? It sure has enough computing power and is engraved into every city in the world with miners. I bet it's intentions are good and it's trying to give us all Lambos.

I still think we need for the whales to be out. Too many OG's and ASIC-Manufacturer's that have uber fat wallets that, at the drop of a hat, can nosedive the price. It'll stabilize when the coins spread out to more hands and then the price will go up.
2017 was the year of the Bull. 2018 was the year of Promise. 2019 will the the year of the Culling, when sh!tcoins cannot weather the coming storm, will drown. IMO I don't expect to see anything spectacular until late 2019/2020 except the market to clean itself up. Still gonna mine the crap out of Altcoins tho!

It'll be years and years before that happens. It needs to grow and stabilize. Nobody is going to adopt something this volatile. Too many whales with fat wallets, funds need to be evened out via newbies to crypto investing. Will only come with time.

I still vote Bcash Core name for the original, because you know, a coin forked from it to "improve" it so we have to call it Bcash Core so nobody confuses the true Bcash 2 with the "core" Bcash  \^\_\^

That's funny because you sound very angry for someone laughing. The first post you look sincere talking about lives ruined and suicides then now you laugh at the same people you feel sorry for.
