America has always had equality of opportunity. The first black millionaire was a woman and she amassed her fortune in the 1890s, well before she was granted "equal rights." Keep whining, though. I'm sure somebody's impressed.

Financial inequality, not inequality of opportunity. The fact a black woman could amass such a fortune running her own company proves that quite plainly. It wouldn't be possible if there was no equality of opportunity, as she literally wouldn't have had the opportunity. And she wasn't the only one, by the way.


You are. Stop making excuses for your behavior.


Prove it. I see immigrants with no english and no wealth start businesses every day. Some fail and some succeed, but that's to be expected. The same with the dirt poor (which I was, by the by). We're talking equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. 
The only people in the US who have no chance whatsoever are those prone to serious addictive behavior, like alcoholism, and those with IQs less than 80. No amount of social engineering is going to level the playing field for those people. It's a good thing they number at less than 20% of the general population, then. What's the other 79%'s excuse?
