I keep seeing this 10k number by Christmas talk.  Where are you speculating this from?  I dont mean this negatively, Im genuinely interested.  Since the announcement of the fork being postponed and even before I keep seeing these big numbers but specifically 10k by Christmas and trading on futures at 50k.  Just interested where you come to this conclusion, and what needs to happen or not happen for that to take place.  Thanks alot.

Thanks for the time and detail put into your response.  I am still pretty new to this and am admittedly a pessimist by nature.  With BTC I’m hoping to be pleasantly surprised.  As you put your disclaimer about it all being speculation, I will go ahead and put mine that the money I have invested is money I’m willing to lose etc.  I sat and watched on the sidelines for years after inherently finding out about Bitcoin from watching a documentaries about the Silk Road without being able to convince myself to buy in.  I still don’t fully understand crypto, and learn more every day.  I hope to eventually become helpful and knowledgeable on the subject, but the sheer amount of different “coins” is astounding.  Add on the forks, having IOS and Android being completely different as far as coins that are accessible, and the possibility of government and inevitably Wall Street getting their hands in it, I am absolutely overwhelmed.   Not to mention the amount of people telling me to get into bitconnect. (Which is a completely different argument).  Anyway, thanks again for taking time to reply to me in such a detailed manner.
