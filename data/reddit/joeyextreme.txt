On it. Thanks.

Thanks. How do I safely generate a new address? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:13:02
You're right. I researched quite a bit then ended up selling most of them and only keeping a few in Mycelium while I learn the ropes. I don't really have time right now to get to where I'm confident.

Don't forget Cthulubuntu.

Also, it was a trading/gaming card exchange. That was what did it for me. No disrespect, but seriously.

If Bitcoin is so irrelevant why is it the topic of so many of your account's topics? Are you just spreading the word to help out fellow reddittors?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:16:10
I'm pretty sure in cases such as this, violence is definitely the answer.

Fucking idiot.

10/10 would hire.

It's fine to be bearish on bitcoin, but you really take it to the next level and make a full-time job of it. Did you stand by and watch it rob the wrestling match you just won but then it later killed your uncle who had raised you as a father? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:15:09
Why are you using r/bitcoin then? GTFO.
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:25:02
Anecdotal. Plus, your clients are stupid to not know they're breaking the law as well.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:10:31
I think it's okay to keep $45 on an exchange. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:14:55
But Silk Road is gone. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:11:34
Actually it's better in this case to not be a cheap bastard and just pay for the pizza and share it. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:18:36
Holy shit. Looking at this guy's history, he either gets paid to slander bitcoin full-time or bitcoin raped and murdered his kids.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:15:19
You should probably elaborate on that a bit, since it sounds idiotic as is.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:19:52
Noob Sailbot here. Could someone explain the coco thing?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:23:59
It's the folds that make it look small.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:56:07
So the reason for this post is...
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:01:33


No, your account history being 95% sarcastic, negative, and generally uninformed comments not contributing to the conversation makes you a troll.


If you see it as an experiment then why are you trying to interfere and influence the results by making negative posts and comments? 


That may be true.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:13:28
I'm saying you're using a bad example if you're trying to talk about the difference between bitcoin and fiat. The possibilities are a lot greater than some cheapskates splitting a $20 lunch. If that's how you're explaining the potential of bitcoin to people you're doing us all a disservice.

That counts as "sending money to a friend." That doesn't require a fee. Sending the rent to your landlord via Paypal would though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:08:28
Well you're here so you're sort of near it. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:40:25
It's Biff.
