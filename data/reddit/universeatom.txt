Predictions on when we'll pass 20K?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:58:36
Oh I'm sure you'll be fine, especially when you're a millionaire...
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:21:37
He's referring to the Tesla 3 which starts at 35K
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:47:18
Appreciate it, probably will be online in a couple of days I bet.
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:28:00
Do you know where to watch the full documentary? I cant find that shit anywhere
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:28:52
What is a good safe alternative for accurate price data you'd say?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:39:40
We need to educate the masses somehow...
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:06:19
To be fair this was in 2015 maybe his thoughts have changed like Theil and others
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:38:08
I respect his opinion, very well thought-out and openminded towards disruptive technology. Unlike Jamie Dimon who rather throw insults and throw tantrums like a little spoiled child.

In simple terms a transaction fee does happen but Coinbase/GDAX eats the transaction fee. GDAX interface is a bit more complicated and has a learning curve. Search YouTube videos about GDAX and you should be good to go. You use the same account login info from Coinbase on GDAX, which means no need to create a new account on GDAX.

So far governmental system failures or economic collaspses have boosted Bitcoin in large numbers. For example look at Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Obviously it's hard to compare these countries economically to the U.S. Nonetheless it's interesting to think about.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:04
He's trying to save his shitty company after a failure takeover event by him and his peers. So much better wallets out there fellas, don't support these cowards.
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:05:09
Makes perfect sense. Musk is always one step ahead of us. We're trying to go to the moon while he's trying to colonize it... interesting...
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:15:34
Hopefully Santa brings us 10K per Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:43:42
Alright I'm not understanding one bit. When you're buying something with Bitcoin you're transferring it from one wallet to another. You're not technically turning it into fiat, the seller probably will later on his end though. So if I transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase to my wallet would I also have to pay capital gains tax? Aren't these the same thing in a way?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:58:57
it's referring to the amount of power each of these 6 individuals had on Bitcoin's possible future. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:54:55
Bitcoin Gold is a scam don't even entertain it. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:44:41
I just think its ridiculous that people on exchanges might get it faster than us, when we actually hold our private keys...
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:46:10
You can't be serious... The chances of both chains failing are very miniscule
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:32:08
Coinbase needs competition, innovation will then proceed and buying/selling feels like also decrease. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:11:03
I've been saying Bitcoin will be 8K-10K by December for the past few months. I still stand by this, after the fork the clouds will fade away and we'll be one step closer to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:45:22
That will only create a false perception that Bitcoin is somehow a scam to them
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:34:33
One way he recently helped with PR's energy grid when the U.S government didn't do as much as they should of. 
@_date: 2019-12-13 10:00:36
Looks like the Galaxy Fold, it costs over 2 grand.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:55:37
The math is actually wrong. 2 plus 2 is 4 minus 1 that's 3, QUICK MATHS!
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:19:02
One reason and one reason only mass adoption. Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the world. It will give Bitcoin major credibility towards mass adoption
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:44:26
This was posted couple of hours ago at CoinDesk...
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:50:53
I understand that, but with each fork competition is increasing against BTC. I've seen other subreddits cough cough not to mention any names.... who realistically think BCC will surpass BTC market cap. It splits the community into this war mode mentality. I believe in BTC all the way into the moon baby, I just wish every small issue in BTC future does not create a fork.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:01:53
Is there a reason why they aren't that popular compared to Coinbase? Wouldn't a decentralized currency pair better with an decentralized eexhange?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:37:22
100% of my net worth is in and im only worth $500. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:25:43
Temporary fix is using a interest free credit card. But obviously don't spend more then you can afford.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:45:01
Might be get your wallet ready boys we might have another golden opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:08:26
Why are you trying to make him scam his mother.. lmao 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:32:09
See it from a different perspective. You're a automobile company that designs gas cars. Your competition is building more efficient and better for the environment electric cars. Do you throw a tantrum while sitting on top of your hands? Or would a intelligent business CEO start to shift towards the future to create more gains long term, which increases the longitievity of the business. These billionares if smart would see Bitcoin the same way.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:10:05
Idk maybe they prefer ETH. Also communist countries don't like decentralized things, just ask China
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:01:38
These are the same people who regret's not getting into the Bitcoin marathon early. So instead they say a few things to critique it and weak tiny hands start selling, which in return gives them an golden opportunity to buy Bitcoin for a more then reasonable price for a profit.
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:56:28
In before the thirsty comments from Mountain dew and Doritos consumers...
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:36:59
I knew it was open source man, didn't realize open source software were bug free.  I'm always learning.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:21:12
Curious why you bought only $4550 worth rather then a full Bitcoin only a cool $70 away lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:41:51
Lol why don't you just post your reasoning now?
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:57:23
I'm thinking the same way, hopefully people can work things out like adults instead of trowing tantrums. Comprimising at certain times is key.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:13:19
Better investment would be to put that $2500 into Bitcoin when the next dip arrives.
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:58:44
But which to invest in down the road?
@_date: 2017-09-23 19:55:30
Might be a stupid question, but how would someone file taxes when using decentralized exchanges? Any gains made aren't recorded.
@_date: 2017-09-24 01:52:50
Great read, thanks for the free link!
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:37:12
Why would you get out at 3.9K? I personally don't see Bitcoin dropping under 3.5K based on the charts at the moment, it's starting to stabilize a bit as we speak. Anyone speculation is as good as mine. I'm long term Bitcoin. Btw if you do short often and live in America IRS next year will start enforcing capital gains tax for any profits made with Bitcoins. You'll have to track everytime you sold and how much profit you made and it gets exhausting, last but not least they'll take a 30% cut.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:02:58
Majority of news sources aren't balanced. Every organization and business or group have a motive. Your goal shouldn't be to find the most neutral or fair group, which is impossible to do as humans. But to consume as much resources from different perspectives as possible, then form your own opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:57:56
Does that mean incoming new ICO's or current ICO's as well?
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:22:36
What's replay protection mean?
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:07:49
It "Should" yes in an ideal fantasy world. This is not the case in reality. Every news organization has a motive, the ones you hate and watch.
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:11:09
So this will be the first time exchanges and most of the miners will be going against the core devs?
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:41:42
But what if SATOSHI was trying to send you a message? Maybe he's the actual block chain...
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:44:46
This is why HODL is the only mantra, day traders will eventually lose.

If you guys think anything will happen to him you're to gullible. He owns so many politician puppets from Democrats to Republicans. Sadly the system can't touch him just like in 2007 when the crash happened.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:24:05
I made a mistake saying transaction fees but I think I'm referring to miners fees. Every time you transfer from exchange to exchange or exchange to wallet isn't a miner fee deducted from your transfer? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:02:44
I still predict Bitcoin going to 8-10K by the end of December.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:59:28
Well thanks for stating the obvious
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:25:32
Idk why I'm laughing so uncontrollably to a simple comment, cheers! ��
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:10:58
It's good to get their name out in the Bitcoin community, eventually when Bitcoin get's close to the moon the dinosaurs will be extinct on Earth via an asteroid.

Of course they would. French citizens have always been fighting for freedom from any sort of higher monarchy, since the French revolution.

Idk whose thirstier the girl or the guys in the comments...
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:55:44
Very well thought out answer, I appreciate your insight has changed the way I look at Bitcoin forever..
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:33:14
Calm down dude, I'm for Bitcoin to the fucking moon. Just had an speculative thought
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:15:23
Maybe short term fast profits, invest that money into their own government coin. This allows them to incorporate the blockchain but control it as well.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:39:45
Thanks I appreciate the response.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:48:50
Alright meet me inside FBI headquarters?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:27:13
Are you talking about the current Bitcoin dip at 6.5K? Couple of months from now this would of been a steal. Never try to time the market. Consistently invest weekly, however if there's a dip invest a bit more then usual, this is the only way to keep your sanity.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:59:33
Why are people so thirsty over her? Looks pretty average to me...

Maybe sees Bitcoin as a threat? Dunno Putin and Vitalik did have multiple private talks though.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:21:13
Sorry I think I'm referring to the miners transaction fees. I don't think Coinbase charges any fees for transferring Bitcoins to any type of wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:46:43
If you rub his head and make a wish, we might hit 100K in a year..
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:51:03
Aren't you paying a whole lot of fees?
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:00:32
Why don't you just buy from Amazon, easily get it in 2 days. Slightly higher price beats waiting 4 months...
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:55:16
BCH can also be worthless at that time. The point is you won't get access to your coins instantly, which can possibly hurt you from buying a bigger percentage of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:14:10
PayPal tried to become its own digital currency and replace the dollar when driven by Elon Musk and Peter Theil, it ultimately failed that goal. It's interesting how they've both been pretty silent about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:48:06
Is there any billionares who actually support Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:42:49
Bro that's your mom though.... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:34:04
People ask this same exact question when Bitcoin was $300,  $2800, $3500, $4800, $5500. Do you see the pattern? If you truly believe in Bitcoin and block-chain technology then this is still early adoption. Bitcoin is a risky investment, but what would hurt yourself the most is knowing you didn't have the confidence to get in when the price was low compared to 3 years from now. The choice is in your hands young grasshopper...
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:06:55
Lmao such a simple comment but I can't stop laughing cause it's so true...
@_date: 2018-07-04 07:16:54
Are you single by any chance? I promise I'm not a Monero digger ��
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:12:24
So you're saying that the force is within me?
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:28:01
Keep telling yourself that bud, the only winners in this market will be long term investors. We wont see anything less then 3,000. This is a short drop as weak tiny hands spill their Bitcoins, China also wont ban Bitcoin's they'll just make sure to receive a nice profit from Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:21:53
People should print this out and put it all over heavy populated cities!
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:58:33
This plus the Russia news about possible Bitcoin ban
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:25:15
Well if Coinbase gives segwit2x the BTC ticker we'll have a major problem. Plenty of new and beginning bitcoin investors will be lost in the woods. Especially if the segwit2x coin's value starts to tank early on.
