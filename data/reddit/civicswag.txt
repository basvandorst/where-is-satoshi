I’m not very educated when it comes to computers can you answer a question for me. I’ve always wandered how do you mine bitcoin? Your computer just goes through sequences until it finds the right one or what? And how is that profitable? How could bitcoin be stolen by a hacker it’s just all online? I just don’t understand it at all. There’s no real money I mean it’s all digital so what is it that’s worth anything? Can you or someone please explain the basics in laymen’s terms.

I understand now! It’s like the miners are keeping track of the books so to speak.

I just asked my husband luckily he hadn’t done it yet cause he was waiting on his broker to help him do it or something idk but it was taking a little more time and he hadn’t got around to it. I think it dropping  today made him think twice if he does invest I’m sure it won’t be near as much.

He’s a big gambler. Idk hopefully he hasn’t done it yet (he was talking about it like 10 days ago) and whatever happened recently will make him more cautious. Maybe I can at least talk my husband into telling him to invest less. It definitely won’t break him by any means but it’s still scary.  He owns a big business and has a lot of investments so I don’t see him as some old guy that barely knows what he’s doing but it still seems a little reckless imo.

My father in law is investing 100 grand in btc and I don’t know if I should be nervous for him or not �� he can afford to lose it but still 100 grand is a 100 grand.
