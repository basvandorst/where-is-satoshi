Sure it’s not the best but it does more transactions per day than btc and manages to keep the price super low. The only time it is delayed is from exchanges playing games holding up withdrawals, wallet to wallet is very nice. Sure it couldn’t replace visa but scaling solutions are being worked on, I am more optimistic for eths future

Bitcoin is done, by Q2 2018 you will see the eth/btc ratio flying upward (it already has been gaining)
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:27:47
The ones who actually use crypto don’t want to pay very high fees and wait usually an hour at minimum to be able to move their money. If you want to buy altcoins or move money btc is not a good way especially if only moving a few hundred $. Once more people start to realize this you will likely see my prediction play out. It’s already starting to, people moving from the dinosaur btc to newer coins with better outlooks. 
The Microsoft thing is irrelevant but I completely understand why they would stop accepting it. Probably created more support issues than it was worth, because of how long + expensive btc is to send for the customer.

Bitcoin is honestly becoming shit eth is going to overtake it soon if something doesn’t change. Eth is fast and you will never pay more than $1 in fees even if you jack up the gas price and limit

It’s not a troll it’s 100% how I and everyone I have talked to about crypto in real life feels 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:25:54
You’re basically right. It is what is is. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:57
If you are serious about this you can look into margin trading stocks. You can borrow 2x whatever you have pretty cheaply. Robinhood offers 2k for $10 a month to trade with. 2k is absolute minimum amount you need by law for margin.
It’s risky and not a good idea to try using your cc, but yes that is possible too. Be careful you will lose and gain money 2x as fast. Possible to get better leverage elsewhere but it’s a start.

Na you can’t but he asked about stocks too which was why I mentioned
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:12
Tether 
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:46:02
That is a 30% difference....obviously they care....lol wow....

Go to Gemini and spread the word about Coinbase and their foul play 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:54:38
$1600 today if approved, I believe it won't be announced today and ignored though 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:31:31
Dropping HARD 970
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:50:30
Bitcoin interest has definitely gone up big time these past few months. Ever since hitting 1000 a lot of people have gotten onboard 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:55:45
They charge the most in fees by far and get lots of kick backs from the us govt. it is pathetic and manipulative of them. I will never use their exchange again. Gemini or lbc 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:58
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:22:21
I personally would wait until late tonight or tomorrow morning, obviously there is no correct answer so monitor price swings accordingly 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:32:46
Coinbase will be the fastest if you upload your id 
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:09:58
You can send them just like you normally would, nothing special needed
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:37:52
Bad move.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:56:04
Why do you need to wait 8 days to sell? Verify yourself on an exchange you should get the money instantly...I do on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:59:52
It didn't die but wait until China starts waking up
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:13:12
Listen to your gut. Sell and buy back in later. These guys are delusional with their HODL meme. Yeah over time bitcoin will rise but you can make better profits buying and selling
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:27:08
No, realistically bitcoin would plummet and probably never recover. Like $400 or less if it really happens. Leaving it alone with high fees is preferred imo to killing it but what do I know
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:15:46
Sucks I can't sell on coinbas lol
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:58:20
Still I recommend moving all assets off of their site. I believe they kept the site down on purpose
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:46:12
It's bs because they are the most expensive but the most unreliable and shady. They also will ban you for sending your coins to another person
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:11
Yeah I'm done with cb too, absolutely ridiculous. It's clearly  being done purposely. They charge the most in fees, and knew way in advance of this day. Foul play here
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:38:42
0 fees for GDAX market makers. Never paid a cent for my trades 
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:37:54
But there are NO fees for market makers on GDAX. 0. You can daytrade your heart out and I suggest doing so whenever volume is above average.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:39:50
Quite risky but hope it works out for you
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:57:59
Problem with breadwallet is while it is secure you will have to sync the chain when you want to retrieve your wallet (taking a long ass time and failing sometimes on mobile) these guys are paranoid just keep your $100 worth of btc on Coinbase they insure up to 250,000 worth.
People have millions on gdax every day your $100 is safe 
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:21:50
Yea they will ask about account balances and history etc. will take some time but it's happened to a lot of people you will be good 
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:10:07
You gotta contact support they will ask you some questions to verify identity and remove 2fa. Or if you have your secret code they give when you first sign up 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:09:38
How is this any different from regular stock trading? Really it's just on a much smaller scale. Ya there are no real laws against things like creating fud and shorting but this type of manipulation goes on daily on the Nasdaq as well, I see it all the time. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:35:07
I could easily see 10k but for 100k it will need world wide regulation and licensed exchanges like futures. It would be banned if it got too big. No rules anything goes right now legally (even wash trading with yourself to pump price). Very fun but whole market could be fake price imo because of this. 
What I mean is bitfinex the exchange has a coin that is supposed to be 1:1 with USD, but they have been printing them out of thin air ever since they were cut off from most world banks (because of USDT ponzi!)
Here is a good article explaining my concerns: 
I’m still involved a lot with crypto but mostly just trading now, too much money to sit out on it 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:26:58
It sounds like they will be keeping the new coins if you leave btc in Coinbase. Lol 
@_date: 2017-07-09 04:09:49
You sound very ignorant honestly and refuse to even want to understand. You need to read how btc and Blockchain tech works. Fees are voluntary you could have paid less than a few dollars (or no fee at all) and had the transaction filled eventually. In your ignorance you got ripped off and want to blame everyone else.
Higher fee will process faster to miners. You gotta learn more I honestly suggest just selling your btc or giving it away
