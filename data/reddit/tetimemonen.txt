it's not a scam. this is normal for your first buy. just read the text on their website. still virwox has high fees

1. wait for the btc to show up under your address as confirmed. you can use an explorer like this to check your address: 
2. don't enter your private key anywhere. better don't take it with you at all. just give him the address

but you posted it so someone will brute force it before you. if this is the real private key then funds are not safu
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:50:01
what's the point? you should keep your ledger safe

Only site that accepts paypal is virwox. it works but it's a bit difficult and the fees are high. better use something like coinbase with credit card

I would recommend you to learn the basics of bitcoin and the market before

paper wallet if you want to store them for a longer period of time. hardware wallet if you have some money left to buy one. only worth it if you invest more than $500 I would say

coinbase is fine for buying crypto but If you want to hold I wouldn't leave coins on an exchange

quantum computers might be able to find a private key from an address once they become better and more reliable.
In theory this will be easiest for them if they know the address plus at least one signature of the corresponding private key.
That means if you've never spent from an address it will be more secure than one that has been spent from and people will be advised to move their funds to fresh addresses.
That's why some cryptocurrencies already plan ahead. The one I know best is IOTA which uses Winternitz One-time Signatures. remaining funds get moved to a new address in your control after a part was sent.

Hold until you're 18 I guess. You probably would have lost the money anyway trying to daytrade.

@_date: 2018-07-28 14:13:59
sorry, it's lost

And don't ever give your private key to anybody. only the public address. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:54:37
when you see the btc in your address they are yours and can't be taken away from you
