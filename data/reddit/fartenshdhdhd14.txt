after 1500 paxful asked you for an ID
but you can also just create a new account to get around it and trade without ID up to 1500

waste of time trying to use that platform if you dont own btc already
just got to paxful for p2p trades in Inidia, it takes 10% of the time
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:08:38
look no further 
@_date: 2019-04-24 12:51:27
how is the payment processed on the back end?
who processes the payment for my item if I go through your platform and how are refunds processed as result?
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:26:36
you obviously never used paxful.
If i want to buy bitcoin there only the SELLER needs to put the Bitcoin to escrow
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:25:02
check paxful.com
they have some offers without needing ID
@_date: 2019-04-25 13:31:09
yes that's why i use paxful as they provide escrow

there was a thread here about how this plugin was very shady and essentially gets full control over your coinbase api keys
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:18:30
Just use paxful
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:01:38
I'd just withdraw the BTC and sell it on paxful for cash / bank transfer etc,
no kyc worries there 
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:04:22
how did you buy it, 
sent funds to an exchange, I would use a peer to peer platform like paxful if using cash app as there you will just be buying from another regular user since its a peer to peer exchange 
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:39:20
oh right, so the let you buy bitcoin and then ban you for buying bitcoin
*taps head*
solid strategy guise 
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:15:31
I mean from who did you buy bitcoin
If you sent money to an exchange account like coinbase they probably have all these accounts flagged as exchange accounts and blocked you becasue of this.
if you bought peer to peer on a site like paxful then this would not happen as you would be trading with another private individual 
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:36:51
you can use a peer to peer exchange like paxful for this

even better, the Democrats have somehow become the police state party in the last decade
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:02:17
they really loving digging their own graves at this point
even better, the Democrats have somehow become the police state party in the last decade

wow this site looks like 90s all over again.  
I'm not trusting my BTC on there bud :D 
sure i need to KYC on paxful but at least they are trusted
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:46:06
depends on what payment method you choose, 
if you want to do bank transfer or cash deposit the markups are much less.
also you are buying from private people so the market more or less sets the rate
@_date: 2019-05-06 18:03:54


yea if you buy their shady stablecoin token with no proof of funds, supply or anything. 
I might as well put my money in a bag and throw it off a bridge than trust a site with a name like "mooncoins"
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:16:23
somehow i doubt it, systems rarely make errors but users so and if/when they do its not because they "stole from you"
