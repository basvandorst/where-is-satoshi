Thanks for that. Giving the "reset blockchain" option a go now.

Great picture and good to meet you!

That solved the problem although I had to reset all transaction history for the wallet. I tried to just reset to yesterday but that just removed the transaction in question and didn't reset the wallet balance. 
Thanks for the help

This was my first "in person" Bitcoin transaction and he recognised my stall from the reddit post I made last year.  So thanks Reddit and Bitcoin.

Many thanks. Trying that option now.

Sorry I didn't even think about that. Edited with text

That could be the feeling of freedom ;)
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:38:07
Yes sorry. Edited my post to include that information

Your customer was camera shy unfortunately but she said thanks and was pretty amazed . Good stuff
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:31:57
Sounds like a good plan. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:09:27
Yeah that would be good. I will try and do that next weekend

The market is in Bangor this weekend and will be at Belfast city hall next weekend. Thanks for your support.

You guys are great. Thanks for the response. I currently have my tablet to accept bit coin through bitpay but here is a link to buy someone a latte.
I will try and get some pics of happy customers up later.

Amazing. I will try and get my first 3 customers to pose for the camera this morning. You have just started 3 peoples day on a very positive vibration. Many thanks 
@_date: 2013-05-18 10:25:12
That's a very good idea. I will offer that next weekend.

Three happy customers with their morning joe.
Two Canadian tourists and one market trader.
None of these people have heard of bit coin until now. I'm handing out bitcoin info flyers to help folk understand what it is.
Thanks for the support

Your happy customer. He is another stall holder selling spiritual items and rare stones. 
Many thanks
